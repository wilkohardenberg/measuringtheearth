PART I.

INTRODUCTORY STA'.l'El\'IEN'l'. 'l'he progress made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey during the fiscal year 18!l7 in the various branches of work committed to its care is duly set forth in this report, being briefly outlined i11 this iJttroductory statement, in the general summary, and the statistical tables, an<l more fully exhibited in the abstracts of reports from field parties an<l in office reports. 'l'he usual maps and sketches, showing graphically the pro'gl·ess of the Survey, aud the requisite illustrations, accompany the report, and will be found in their appropriate places. Field opemtion.~.-l'he field operations carried on dUI"ing· the year included the measurement of base lines; reconnaissance, triangulation; astronomical determinations of time, latitude, and azimuth; telegrapltic and chronometric determinations of longitude; topograpltical aud hydrogra11hical surveys and resurveys; tidal and current observations; determinations of magnetic declination, dip, and intensity; pendulum observations for determination of the force of gravity; geodetic and ordinary spirit leveling; Coast Pilot examinations; boundary-line surveys; special topographic and hydrographic examinations, including the investigation of reported dangers to navigation; the laying out and marking of naval speed-trial courses; and special surveys for other departments of the Government. About forty parties were engaged on the various brauclles of the work during the year, and rneir fields of operation embraced nearly all scctio118 of the country. Surveys or observations were conducted within the limits or on tlte coasts of l 9 States and Territories along the seaboard, and in U interior States and Territories. The operations of importance begun, continued, or completed duriug the year may be eumnerated as follows: Completion of the topographic and hydrographic resurvey of Buzzards Bay; continuation of hydrographic surveys and examinations on the coast of Massachusetts; surveys in Block Island Sound and off J\Iontauk Point; hyclrographic exami11ations in Marthas Vineyard and Nantucket sounds; topographic survey of Marthas Vineyard; topographic survey of' :N aushon Island; continuation of the topographic resurvey of the sout.liern shores of Long· !:>laud; connection of the lo11gitnde st:ttion at Montreal, Canada, with the primary triangulation of Vermont and New York; telegraphic longitude determinations at varions eastern points, a.nd connection of the longitude net of the United States with that of Europe, through Montreal, Canada; completion of the main triangulation eastward across the States of Maryland and De!aw are to Capes May and Henlopen; resurvey of Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, triaugulat10n, topography, and hydrography; latitude and magnetic determinations in the States of Deh~ware and Virginia; resurvey of Brunswick Bar, St. Simon Sound, Georgia; geodetic co11nect10u of the Atlantic and Gulf coast of Florida; hydrograpltic examination of the month of Savannah River, Georgia; Lldal observations at various points on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacifie coasts; .survey of Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, triangulation, topography, and hydrography; c~.mplet1on of the primary triangulation of the oblique arc in Alabama; precise leveling from v wksburg to Meridian, Miss.; coutiunation of toe determination of points in aid of State surveys;

Bequests from national or State authorities for special surveys or for the detail of' ofticers for special service ha Ye ueen complied with whenever practicable, in accordance with the uniform practice, and the following operations may be mentioned in this connection: Determination and marking of a uew position for the Nantucket South Shoal Light-ship, a.t the request of the Light-Douse Board; laying ont and marking of speed-trial courses in Chesapeake Bay and San Francisco Bay, at the request of the Navy Department; resurvey of Brunswick Bar, St. Simon Sound, Georgia, for the \Var Department, in accordance with tlw provisions of t!ie river a11d harbor act of Ju11e 3, 18913; exaniinatio11 of a portion of the boundary between Spal'tanbnrg and Greenville counties, S. C., at the req nest of the county commissio11ers; 11ydrographic survey of the mouth of Brazos River, '.l.'exas, for the ascertainment of the eliaracter and value ol' the improvements made by the Brazos Hiver Channel and Dock Uompany, at the request of the board of engineers appointed hy the honorable Secretary of \Var in accordance with the provisions of tl1c river and harbor act of June 3, 18U6; hydrographic examination in the vicinity of the Port Orchar<l Naval Station, at the request of the Navy Department. Special assignments.-The assignments of two of the Assistants of the 8nrvey to special duty by appointment of the President have been continued, one as a member of the l\iississi ppi Hiver Oornmission and the other as member of the Iuternational Boundary Commission, organized for the survey and marking of that portion of the boundary liue between the Uuited States and l\lexieo to the westward of El Paso. The former assignment continued throughout the year and the latter until September, when the labors of the boundary commission were completed. Four other Assista11ts were also detailed for short periods on spt:cial duty, as follows: One as member of tile uoard uf engineers appointed to examine and report upon the improvements made at the mouth of tbe Brazos River; one as a member of the Santa l\1onica-San Pedro Deep \Vater Harbor Board; one to accompany the Greenland Exploring Expedition; and one to accompany Prof. H. G. Bryant's l\1ount St. Elias Exploring Expedition. Iu the last two cases all expenses, excepting tlJC salaries of the oflicers ·detailed, were paid by those having charge of tlie expeditions, I?ut copies or originals of all valuable records obtained have been Jiled in the archives of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The magnetic and gravity observations made in various parts of British North America and Greenland by the Assistant who accompanied the Greenland Exploring Expedition will· prove of special value to this Survey. Office u·ork.-In the otlice a large amount of work bas been accomplishe<l in the reduction computation, and discussion of field observations, and in preparing for publication the charts of the Survey, the Coast Pilot, the annual Tide Tables, and the monthly Notices to Mariners. The Notices to Mariners, as usual, have been distrilmted gratuitously. The issue during the year of the above-named publjcations has been as follows: Oharts, 57 188; Coast Pilots, 1 284; Tide Tables, 6 796; Notices to Mariners, G 100. O.ffice of Standard Weights cwd 1llcasurcs.-The usual amount of work in testing, verifying, and standardizing weights and measures for departments of the Government, States, educational institutions, and private pa1'ties, has been accomplished, aud inform at ion has been promptly furnished to all applicants. For the work done for outside parties a nominal charge is made and the proceeds are covered into the Treasury. Some progress has been made also in the preparations for the construction and verification of ~Iectrical standards, but a point ltas now been

reached where a11 increase of the instrumental outfit is imperatively demaiuled. 'l'he annual appropriation of $500 for the purehase of materials and apparatus a11d for incidental expenses of the office is iuadequate, aud au earnest rPcommeiulation is made for its increase to 82 500. 'l'his increase, as stated iu the Jetter accompanying the estimates for the fiscal year lSUH, is uot intended to be continuous, but to apply only for a single year to enable the office to procure instruments which are indispensable. · Arran{fc111cnt of thi.~ rcport.-The usual division of the report into two parts, one containing the historical matter a11d giving detailed accounts of the various field and office operations, the usual statistical tables, i;>ffice reports, a11d financial statements, and tLe other containing the scientific papers relatiug to methods, discussions, aud results, has been retained. '.rite contents of Part I are arranged on the following order: Introductory statement, iucluding brief notice of field and office work, special assignments, Office of Standard 'Veights and Measures, geographical classilication of localities of field work, and special operations; Ge11eral statement of progTess in field and office work; Estimates for the fiscal year 18!)9 in detail, and the explanations accompanying them; A hstracts of reports from field parties, including Easteru, .l\lid.dle, 'Vestern, aud Alaska divisions, and special operations; Abstract of otlice and suboffice annual reports; Snpplemen tary tables, viz, No. 1, Showing the distribution and personnel of field parties; No. ~, niviug statistics of field :rnd o111ee work; :No. 3, Giving list of information furnished during the yt·ar in reply to official and personal calls; (>flke annnal reports, viz, No. I, lleport of the Assistant in Oharge of the Otlice, accmnpanie<l by reports of the various chief's of divisions; No. 2, Report of the hydrographic inspector; No.:~, Heport of the disbursing agent; No. 4, He port of the Assistant in Charge of the Office of Standard 'Vcights and l\leasun·s; List. of maps arnl progress sketches to illustrate the work, and the maps and sketches themselves a.t the end of the volume.

SORVEY, 1Vashinr1ton, T>. O., September 29, 18.97. Sm: I have the honor to transmit herewith the estimafos for the Office of Stanllanl Weights and Measures for the liscal year 1899, and beg to submit the following explanations in regard to changes recornme11ded: For the pay of the adjuster an increase of $300 is strongly urged as a just recognition of meritorious service. 'l'he same recommendation was made last year, lrnt was not allowed by Congress. The change in the designation of the assistant messenger to adjuster's helper is also recommended, for the reason that the present designation is 11ot ap1)ropriate and prevents the oflice from securing the kind of help required. 'fhe duties required are miscellaneous in their character and include clerical and other work which the civil service rules do not permit messengers to perform, and as 110 increase in the compensation is asked for there would appear to be no valid objection to tlie change suggested. 'l'he increase in the item for purchase of materials and apparatus and for contingent expenses is rendered necessary by the new work devolving on the Weigllts and Measures Office in connection with the construction ancl verification of electrical standards. Oµr outfit for this work is very meagre, and the immediate purchase of a number of new instruments is absolutely necessary. It is not intended, however, that this increase of appropriation should be co11tinuous, but will apply only to the fiscal year 1899. W, W. DUFFIELD, Yours, respectfully,

Coniwct-ion of )Immt Uo.IJal, n«ar ,lfonfreal, Cnnada~ with the primary tria11r1ulation of l'amont mul Nc11 York.-ln April, 18!17, Assistant A. 'l'. l\fosman was directed to complete the primary triangulation of V crmont and New York and to extend it to 1\Ionnt Hoyal, at l\'Iontreal, Canada. The scheme contemplated the occupation of l\'Iount Hoyal for the measurement of the angle between the stations ''Bellevue'' and "Dannemora," in Vermout and :N" ew y'ork, respectively, and the observation at "Monut Mansfield" of the liues to "Bellevue," "Dannemora," "Bigelow," ''Blueberry Hill," and "Potato Hill." The inclusion of the stations "High Gate," "Monut 'Washington," and" Killington" was left to Assistaut }fosman's judgment, it being necessary to learn somethiug· of the ditliculties aud the consequent amount of time and expense involved. Assistant Mosman, accompanied hy Assistant C. C. Yates, left vVashiugton on tlie l!Jth of April and arrived at Montreal on the ~5th. A tripod and scaffol1l signal 40 feet in height was erected on :M:ount Hoyal, and the station prepared for occupation. Meanwhile a signal pole was placed on ''Mount Johnston,'' and heliotropers were posted by Assistant Yates on "Bellevue" and ''Dannemora." Owing to continued cloudy and rainy weather no observations could be obtained until May 15, and from this date to ,June 15 011ly eight days occurred on which observations were possible. The station was completed 011 "tlrn lGth of .June, aud the party was then moved to l\lount .\I ans field. 'l'he part of the summit locally known as " the nose" was occupied, and for the erection of the piers for the instruments it was necessary to transport by hand up a steep cliff 300 feet high all the requisite materials, such as Cl:ment, sand, broken stone, lumber, and water. The instrn.ments were monnted ready for obser\'ation by June 22, and meanwhile A~sista.nt Yates was engaged in posting heliotropes at" Dannemora,"" Bigelow," "Blueberry llill,~' aud "Killi11gton '' and erecting a signal pole at "Potato Bill." But one observation was obtamed during the remainder of Juue, as tlte weatlter co11ti11ucd unfavorable, storms of rain, snow, and bail being followed by a hazy condition of atmosphere, which rendered the outlines of the mouutains only 20 miles distant hardly disti11guishablc. The party being still in the field at the close of the year, the filial statement of the results' accomplished will be given in my next report.

8TATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Hydro{!raplty on the coast of ;llassaclmsctts, bct1cccn Gloucester and 1llanchestcr.-Early in August,
18HG, the steamer Blnke, under the command of Lieut. Commander A." Dunlap, U.S. N., proceeded

from New York, where she had been undergoing repairs, to the coast of Massachusetts, under instructions to execute a hydrographic survey or the region between Gloucester and l\Iauchestcr. \Vork was begun ou the 12th of August and continued until October 31, when it was completed. The work began at the limit reached by the Bache in 18!J5, and the same system of surveying was followed. 1.'he lines of soundings were usually ruu at intervals of 100 metres and crossed at right angles by auother system of lines similarly spaced, but where channels or shoals required closer development such aduitional lines as were necessary were run. Special attention was given to the examination and development of known ledges and careful search was made for reported new ones. Lieutenant-Commander Dunlap reports the finding of au uncharted ledge about half a mile southsoutheast of Kettle Island Ledge. This, coming within the limits of his h.vdrographic sheet, was carefully surveyed, but he was informed by Capt. \Villiam S. Douglas, of l\Iagnolia, l\fass., that several other uncharted ledges exist to the eastward, to the southward: and to the southward and westward of the one found. Captain Douglas also reports au uncharted shoal, known as Saturday Night Shoal, in S fathoms of water and about 1 mile son th-southeast of Kettle Island Ledge. '.l'hese reported shoals and ledges, not falling within the limit of the pr~jectiou furnished, were not investigated, but will receive early attention. Lieutenant-Commander Dunlap, on the completion of his survey, proceeded with bis vessel to New York, arriviug there on the 3d of November, and made immediate preparations for the taking up of hy1lrngraphic work in Chesapeake Bay. The Blake sailed from New York 011 November 12, and :tfter encountering a severe g·ale off Winter Quarter light vessel, reached the uew working ground in the vieinity of Baltimore Harbor entrance on the 15th. The Chesapeake BlJ,y work will be treated of in a separate paragraph in its proper geog·rnphit-al order. '.rhe statistics of the l\Iassachusetts coast work are as follows:

The naval oliicers attached to the party were as follows: Lieut. Oommander A. Dunlap (in command), Lieut. J. A. Shearman, Eu sign A. T. Long, Ensign J. H. Heitl, Ensign ll . .A. \Viley, P.A. 8nrg. 0. M. De Valin. Contin1tatio11 of tlte hydro!Jraphic resurvey of Buzzardx Bay, Massachusetts.- At the close of the last fiscal year the party on schooner Eagre, under the command of Lieut. G. C. Hauus, U. S. N., wais engaged on the hydrographic resm·vey of the upper part of Buzzards Bay, and the statistics of the work to June 30, 18!)6, are given iu my last report. The work was carried on continuously during the present year whenever the weather conditions permitted, and the party is still iu the field. Much time was necm;sarily lost for field work during the winter months, but the accumulation of office work incident to a large season's work and the overhauling of boats a11d ·Steam launches kept the party fully employed. Of the four hydrographic sheets furnished the party two have been completed aud a third is well adva11ced. A large number of rocks and shoals required special examination and devcloplllent, aud, considermg this fact and the further one that all tl..ie soundings had to be done from small uoats and launches, the amount of work accomplished is very large. Lieutenant Hanus highly commends the zeal and energy displayed by all members of the party. The naval otncers attached to the Bagrc during the year were as follows: Lieut. G. C. Hanns (in command), Lieut. W. A. Bdgar, Ensign ,l. F. Hubbard (detached AJ)ril 20 7 18!)7) 7 Ensign H. A. Wiley (reported on board .May 14 7 18!17), Chief Yeoman William B. Proctor, and Draftsman ,John 1'. ·watkins (from July 21, 1896, to October IO, 1896). Seamen 'I'. James, O. Cary, and S. Petersen served as recorders, and H. L. \.Y opschal served as tidal observer, all performing their duties in a satisfactory manner. A full descriptive report accompanies Lieutenant Hauus's annual report, and much valuable

Continuation <!f the h.11dro_qraphic resun<J.lf f!l lfozzards Bay, Jlassaelwsetts.-Early in .Jnly, 1896, the steamer Bache, under the command of Lieut. UobertG. Peck, U. S.N., left New York for thepurpose of executing a hydrographic surve~; of certain portions of Buzzards Bay, but was directed to stop en route to repaint the buoys of the Long hilancl Sound speed-trial course and determine and mark a position for the Nantucket South Shoal light-ship. 'l'he repainting of the trial-course bnoys was completed on .Tt\ly 10, and Lieutenant Peck then proceeded to New London, Uonn., to obtain from the Light-Honse Depot a buoy and sinker for marking the new position for the South Shoal light-ship. The necessary examination to the southward and westward of Phelps· Bank was then made, and the new llOSition for the light-ship was determined aud marked by the 16th. This position was Hubsequently approved and adopted by the Light-House Board, and on the 17th of October the light-ship was successfully moved to the position recommended. J,ieutenaut Peck proceeded to New Bedf9rd on July 17 and at once began tl..te regular hydrographic work assig·ned him, which was laid ont on four projections whose limits may be thus outlined: Sheets Nos. 1 and 2, on a scale of 1-10000, covered the southern part or Buzll.ards Bay from the vicinity of Woods Hole to a point about half a mile to the westward ofCuttyhunk; sheet -Xo. 3, also on a scale of 1-10000, included the shores on the north side of the hay between the Dumpling Hock and Gooseberry Neck; sheet No. 4~ 011 a scale of 1-20000, covered the central waters of the bay from a line drawn 11orthuorthwesterly from vYoods Hole to the extreme western limit of the resurvey. Of these sheets Nos. 1 aud 2 were completed during the sea.sou, mul considerable work was done on No. 4, nnfa. vorable weather preveuting its completion. Sheet No. 3, from lack of time, was not begun. 'l'he season closed on the last day of. October, aud, in accordance with instructions, Lieutenant Peck then proceeded with his vessel to New York for repairs and for preparation for fnrther service on the soi.1thern coast. The following is the list of naval oflicers attached to the vessel during the season: Lieut. Hobert G. Peck (in command), Bnsigu H. K. Hines, Ensign A. H. Davis, Ensign F. M. Hussell, Master at Arms Thomas A. Martin, Yeoman J. L. Dunn, Asst. Surg. 1\1. K. Johnson, P.A. Surg·. Heury D. \.Yilson, Machinist A. J. Miskimon.

Continuation of the topo_qraphicttl r1~surre!J of Bttzzards lfo.y, 1lfa.~Nachu.~ctts.-At the beginning of the fiscal year, Assistant Stehman l·'orney, in accordance with instructions, proceeded to New Bedford, 1\fass., for the purpose of completing the unfinished topographical sheets of the four parties of the previous year. Ile immc<liately organized two parties, one to be under his own immediate direction and the other under the charge of Mr. \Villiam Bowie, and the former began work in the vicinity of l\fariou, and the latter at 1\fatta1)oisett. 'rho two sheets designated as the Sippican and Mattapoisett sheets were completed by the mid of August, and the parties then moved to Horseneck Beach and l\fonument Beach, respectively, and began work on the unfinished Pada-

'l'hese were completed by the end of October, and Assistant Forney then took up the trigonometrical determination of light-houses in Buzzards Bay, and Mr. Bowie returned to Washington. On the completion of the light-honse determinations the party was disbanded, and Assistant Forney, with a recorder, proceeded to Newburyport, l\lass., where a plane-table survey of the docks aud water front was made. 'l'his was finished by November, and 1\Ir. Forney then returned to \Vashington and was assigned to oftice duty. The recorders and rodmen assigned to the Buzzards Bay parties were .lames M.

1'opographical surrey of Nauslwn ·Island, .llas8achusctts.-Early iu .July, 18!ll3, Assistant W. I. Vinal, in acco~dance with instructions dated Jnne 23, proceeded to Naushon Island, Massachusetts, and orgauized a party for the completion of its topographical suney. The north end or the island was surveyed by Mr. Vinal in 1889, and the shore line of the southern portion had been run by auother party in the fall of the same year. Field operations were begun on July 9, and continued to September :m, when the work was finished, the party disbanded, and 1\Ir. Vinal returned to \Vashi11gto11. Xaushou Island is tlrn property of Hou .·Johu M. Forbes, aud is practically an extensive private park. 1t is stocked with deer an<l other game, and trespassing being strictly prohibited, it was 11ecessary for the party to obtain a permit to go O\"Cr the gmund. 'l'his was secured without difliculty, however, and the party's headquarters were located at 'l'arpauli1i Cove. Assistant Vinal repo1-ts that the contouring- of the island was found complex a11d difficult on account of dense woods and extensive tracts of Scotch broom, the latter being almost impassible and seriously interfering with the rapid progress of the r-;urvey. Nums.irous carriage roads and bridle paths, however, cross the islarnl in various directions, :uHl these greatly facilitated a close inspection of the grounds, bnt adde1l considerably to the details of delineation. 31essrs. H. K Brinker, J ..T. Carlisle, and .J. L. Nisbet were attached to the party ar-; recorders and rodmen, and reudered eflicient service during the season. Assistant Vinal, after his return to \Vashingto11, was e11gaged in inking and lettering topographical sheets, and on miscellaneous duty, until again ordered to the Jield. llis further services duri11g the year will be noticed under the proper geographical lleadings.

Special hydroyraphic examinations and surveys in Nantucket and Vineyard Sounds, an<l on the of Rhode L~land.-Early in October, 18913, Lieut. J. J. Blandin, U. S. N., in command of the steamer EndeaDor, reached Nantncket Sound and iu accordance with instructions proceeded to make certain special hydrvgraphic examinations and sur\'eys required to complete the charts of that locality and Vineyan1 Sound. A large tripod signal was erected on tlie eastern end of 1-'uckernuck Shoal, and after the occupatio11 of the stations on Tuckernuck and Muskeg-et islands the sounding work began, and was continued at every favoral.Jle opportunity until completed. Examinations were made off l\fonomoy Point; on Horseshoe Shoal, to the northward of Cross Hip Light vessel, on Edward Shoal; to the eastward of Mortons Shoal; and to the northward of Hawes Shoal. 'l'ides were observed, during tlie progress of this work, at Hyannis, and the gauge at this point was connected, by a week's simultaneous observatiorn;;, with the one at Edgartown. The hydrographic examinations were rendered difficult by the scarcity and distance of signals, the hazy co11dition of the atmosphere, and the hig-h winds which prevail at this season of the year.

Topograph'icctl .rnrvey of Jllartltns Yincynrd~ Jlfa..~.~aclmsetts.-Iu the spring of 18!!7 two topographical parties, under the direction, respectively, of Assistants W. C. Hodgkins and W. 1. Vinal, were put in the field for the purpose of making a complete survey of l\fartlias Vineyard, l\fassachusetts, the interior of the island uever llaving been surveyed by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Assistant Ilodgkins organized his party at Vineyard Haven early in l\Iay, and witl10ut delay the delineation of the topogra1.ihical features was begun. At the close of the fiscal year fair progress had been made in spite of unfavorable weather conditions, and an area of about 7 square miles was completed. Assistant Vinal organized his party at Edgartowu ou the 7th of May, and· he ah;o at once begau field operations, and at the close of the fiscal ;year had completed an area of about 8 sq narc miles. 'l'he parties being still in the field, the full results and statistics are necessarily deferred, and will appear in tlie next year's report. Determination of the fJC<>!Jraphical position.~ of light-houses in Narragansett Bay nnd l'roi,idence R.ircr, Rhode Jsland.-111 ,J unc, 18!:17, Assistant D. B. Wainwright, in accordance with instructions, proceeded to :Narragansett Bay and Providence HiYer, for the purpose of detcrmiuing the geographical positions of light·hom;es which have been erected subsequently to the executiou of th~ triangulation of that locality. Iucidenta.lly lie also made some trigouometrical determinations desired hy the commaiHlant of Fort Adams, near Newport, It. l. The work was still in progress at the close of the fiscal year, and the results aud statistics will therefore appear in the next year's report. 'l'ele_qraphic longitude determinations and ma[Jnctfo observations at Albany, 11:· .Y., Oambrid[Je, .Mass., and lllontrcal, Oanada.-To complete the scheme of primary longitude work of the United States and strengthen its connection with Greenwich, the lines Albauy-Cambridge and AlbauyMoutreal were required, the latter point having l.Jce11 well determined (in 18!)2) relatively to Greenwich by cable excliauges of time sig11als by Prof. C. H. McLeod, of J.\lcGill Cuiversity, Montreal, and Prof. IL Il. 'l'urner, of the Greenwich Obseryatory, the obserrnrs exchanging stations in the midst of the series. Assistants C. H. Sinclair and R L. Faris were charged with the execution of this work, and the latter also with the determination of the magnetic elements at each station, aud left \VaHhington for Albany and Cambridge respectively on tlle lflth of August, 18!1G. At Albany Assh.;tant Sinclair found the pier of 18!H, in the ground of the Old Dudley Observatory, still in place, erected a wooden observatory over it, completed the necessary arrangements with the Western Union Telegraph Company, and was ready fo1· observing by the 22d. :Meanwhile Assistant Faris had prepared the Cambridge station, the gramte pier used iu the original trans-Atlantic work being used, and was also ready for observing, but on account of cloudy weather time observations were not obtained until the 25tll. Signals were exchanged between the two stations ou August 25, :!6, 28, 29, and 30, and again after the interchange of observers on August 31, Sevtember 1, 4, 7, and S. Assistant Sinclair tllen moved the Cambridge outfit to 111outreal, where Prof. C. ll. McLeod kindly placed at his disposal the observatory and tran_sit pier of tlle :'.\icGill University, so that no tune was lost in preparing a station, aud Assistant Faris remained at Albany. A1Tangernents with the \Vestern Union and the Great Northwestern Telegraph companies having been concluded, observations beg·an at both stations on the lGth. Time exchanges between Albany and .:\Ioutreal took place on September lG, 20, 24, ~8, and October n, and again after interchange of observers, on October 10, 15, 19, 21, and 26, the mtervals between dates being caused by unfavorable weather:

After completing the line the Montreal instruments were taken by Assistant Faris to the New Dn<lley 01.>servatory, Assistant Sinclair remaining at the Old for the purpose of connecting the two, which are about 7~·2 apart in longitude. The method of conducting this work was slightly different from that ordinarily used, as it was desired to compare the diflerential chronometer rate tlerived from the time observations, which involved the personal equation of the observers, with that derived from the arbitrary siguals, which is indepeudent of the observers. This was accomplished by exchanging signals twice during the observations of the regular star list and by interchanging observers 011 alternate nights. The two differential rates were found to disagree, but further experiments showed that the differential rate derived from the arbitrary signals was uniform. In all, eighteen results for difference of longitude were obtained from eight nights' observations, viz, October 29, 30, 31, and November 1, 2, 7, 9, 10. This completed the longitude work of the Reason. At Montreal a local triangulation was executed to connect the longitude station with l\fount Hoyal, wllich is a point of the primary triangulation extending northward through the Hudson Hiver and Lake Champlain valleys. A base 354 metres in length was measured by means of a steel tape belonging to the McGill University, and a gas-pipe signal 65 feet in height was erected on )fount Hoyal. Assistant Sinclair was also directed to occupy Mount Royal for the measurement of the primary angle at .that point between "Bellevue" and "Dannemora," but bad weather prevented the execution of this part of the scheme. Magnetic observations, declination, dip, and intensity, were made by .Assistant Faris during the progress of the longitutle work at :Montreal, in the grounds of the l\foGill University, in the Old Dudley Observatory grounds at Albany, and at Hon. Verplanck Colvin's 1nagnetic station, also in Albany. 'l'wo days' observations were made in each case. On the completion of the work Assistants Sinclair and Faris returned to Washington, and were engaged on their computations aud records until again assigned to field duty. Their further services during the year will be mentioned under the proper geographical beadings. Conti1wation of the hydrographic s11rvcy.~ to the southward of Block Island Sound and o.ff' 1lfonta11 k Point, and special e.J.:aminations at var·io118 point8.-At the close of the last fiscal year the party of the steamer Endeavor, under the command of Lieut. W. S. Benson, U. S. N., was engaged on the hydrographic surveys off l\Iontauk Point an1l to the southward of Block Island Sound, and the progress to that date has already been reported. The work was continued during the present fiscal year and was completed by September 24. Lieutenant Benson, however, was relieved of the command of the vessel· on August 15 and was succeeded the same day by Lieut . ·J. ,J. Blandin, who was previously serving in the party. Special hydrographic examinations were also made off Brightmans Beach, Rhode Island, near buoy No.14, in Fishers Island Sound, and in Greenport Harbor, Long Island. Lieutenant Bla11din's report of the season's work contains much valuable data, for the correction and bringing up to date of the charts of the localities surveyed and examined. The naval officers attached to the Endeai,·or during the season were as follows: Lieut. W. S. Benson (in command until August 15, 1896), Lieut. J. J. Blandin (in command from August 15 to close of the work), Ensign I. K. Seymour (joined the vessel September 5), Ensign C. A. Brand (joined the vessel August 17), Pay Yeoman C.

This work has been noticed in the preceding paragraph. Continuation of the topographical rcsuney of the south ".~hores of Long Island, New York.-On .July l, 18!)6, Assistant C. T. Iardella, in accordance with previous instructions, proceeded to Long Island, accompanied by Aid H. C. Denson, and organized a party for the continuation of the topographical resurvey along its sout.hern shores. Operations were begun July ii near Canoe Place, where the previous season's work terminated, a11d the survey was continued eastward to .Amagansett, where the party was disbanded October 15. The strip of topograplty executed varies from a quarter of a mile to 2 miles in width, and embraces an area of about 2G square miles, and was delineated OH a scale of 1-10000 on four topographical sheets. Tlte actual shore line and a narrow fringe of topography adjacent thereto had been previously snrveyed and does not therefore form a part of the present season's work. Assistant Iardella highly commenus the valuable service rendered by Aid II. C. Denson: who, during a considerable portion of the season, on account of bis chief's ill health, was practically in charge of the conduct of the work.

Messrs. Iardella and Denson returned to ·washiugton at the close of the season's work, and were engaged on their oftlce work until assigned to other duty. The further field services of Mr. Denson will be mentioned under the proper headings elsewhere in this report. Continuation of the tidal reeor<l aiul the automatic tidal ·indicator at Fort HamUton, Neu· York Harbm·.-The self-registering tide gauge at the Fort Hamilton tidal station, established in December, 1892, has continued in successful operation throughout the entire fiscal year, and an unbroken record has been received. Tidal Observer J. G. Spaulding- has continued in charge of the station, and, as heretofore, has made the monthly tabulations and forwarded them with the original rnareg-rams to the office. Mr. Spaulding has also I.tad charge of the tidal indicator, which has continued to work satisfactorily . .Extension 'of the transcontincnta.l a.re eastward to capes Nay and Hcnlopen.-'l'be party of Assistant F. W. Perkins, engaged on the reconnaissance and triangulation to extend the transcontinental arc eastward to capes May and Henlopen, took the field in the latter part of the previous year, and an account of the progress made to June 30, 18!)6, is given in my last, report. '.rhe work was continued in the present year and progressed satisfactorily until August, when an unusually long-continued period of unfavorable weather set in and very much retardecl the observations. Many of the lines of the triangulation were from 20 to 2s· miles in length, and these could only be observed on rare occasions, on accotrnt of the persistent hazy and smoky condition of the atmosphere. Assistant Perkins reports that the average number of days per month 011 which observations were possible was only eight, although heliotropes, and finally night siguals, were used to facilitate operations. Four observers, viz, Assistants F. \V. Perkins, \V. B. Fairfield, and John Nelson, and Extra Observer G. A. Fairfield, took part in the work, so that four stations were occupied simultaneously, thus much reducing the time and cost o( the survey. The c~clo11e which swept over tlte country in September destroyed four of. the observing towers and <lid much damage to tho lofty signal poles of several stations, but a judicious redistribution of the observers prevented any serious interruption of the observations, ahhough the labor and ~xpenses of the construction party, under the charge of Foreman J:tsper S. Bilby, wore nrnch ~ncreased. Assistant John Nelson was relieved from duty in the party in December, as his services were then required in the survey of I,ake Pontchartrain. By January 20 the observations at all stations excepting two wore completed, and Assistant "Perkins was then grauted a furlougt to ena?le him to attend to personal business affairs in Europe, the charge of tbo party then devolvmg upon Assistant W. B. Fairfield. The weather during January and February was cold, stormy, and genera.Uy unfavorable for observations on high signals, but the work was finally completed on the 17th of February and the party disbanclod.

Continuation of the tidal record and the antomatic ti£lal indicator at Reedy hland, Dela1rare Ri1,er.-The automatic tital indicator at l{.eedy Island Quarantine Station, Delaware River, established iu .January, 18!lG, has continued iu successful operation during the fiscal year. The tidal record, by means of a self-registering tide gauge erected at the Harne station, has also been continued, but several bad breaks have occurred during the year. 'fhe tidal station and indicator are under tlie direction of Dr. A. H. Gleunan, of the l\:larine-Hospital Service. Teleg~·aphic determination of the diJference of longitude between lVa.~hington, D. C., and Dover, Del.; al.~o latitude and, magnetic deterrninations.-1n the latter part of April, 1897, Assistauts C. 11. Sinclair and 0. B. French were directed to determine the difference of longitude between "\-Vashi11gto11, D. C., and Dover, Del., connect the Coast and Geodetic Survey Station and the New Naval Observatory, and make incidental latitude and magnetic observatious. Ou 1\Iay I, Assistant 0. B. French proceeded to Dover and prepared the station in the usual manner, Assistant C. 11. Sinclair meanwhile occupying the Coast and Geodetic Survey Observatory. lJ11favorable weather prevented observations Lefore the 'ith, and the first exchange of signals was made on that date. Further excJ1anges were obtained on l\1ay S, n, and 15, bad weather again intervening from the 10th to 14th. 'l'he observers then interchanged stations, and observations were made 011 l\Iay 17, 18, 19, and 20. The longitude station at Dover was located in the grounds adjoiuiug the county court-house and was subsequently connected with the court-house cupola, a point of tlte primary triangulation. At Dover, Assistant French determined the magnetic declination, dip, and illtensity on two days (l\1ay 7 and 8), and Assistant Sinclair determined latitude by sixty-seven observations on seventeen pairs of stars, during four nights, using a zenith telescope and the Talcott method. This latitude and au examination of the country south of Dover for the selection of a suitable site for a station for observing variation of latitude will be mentioned in another paragraph under the head of Special Oreratious. On the completion of the Dover work, .Messrs. Sinclair and French determined the difference of longitude between the Coast and Geodetic Survey Observatory and the New Na val Observatory, both stations having previously been connected with the Old Naval Observatory. Signals were exchanged qn the nights of l\fay 25, 26, 27, and 29, and again, after the usual interchange of observers, on June 1, 2, and 5. Cloudy weather then setting in, the fourth night in the second series was dispensed with, especially as the observations obtained were very accordant and highly satisfactory. Assistant French then determined the latitude at the New Naval Observatory Station by ninety-eight observations on twenty pairs of stars during six nights, the point of observation being finally referred to the center of the clock room of the Observatory. Messrs. Sinclair and French were then engaged on office dnty, the former until .June :.:JO, when lte was again assigned to field duty, aud the latter, until the close of the fiscal year.

Continuation of the tidal reeorrZ at the tide-gauge station at the United States Navy-Yard, lVashington, JJ. C.-The i:.;elf-registering tide gauge established iu 1891 at the 'Vuslli11gton Navy-Yard tidal station has been kept in successful operation throughout the entire fiscal year, and a continuous record has been obtained. As heretofore, the gauge has been under the charge of tile chief of the tidal divisio11 of the otlice. Resurvey of Chesapeake Bay a1ttl tributaries-Triangulation of Patapseo !liver and npper part of bay from Kent Ji;land to Poolcs hland.-A resurvey of Chesapeake Bay having become necessary on account of the numerous aud extensive cllauges that have taken place since the old survey, arrangements were made to execute the work as rapidly as possible, and several parties have been engaged on tllis duty during the present year. The triangulation of the portion from Kent Island to Pooles Island and of Patapsco H.iver was assigned to Assistant D. B. Wainwright, who took the field early in July, 1890. As far as possible the points determined in the original triangulation were to be utilized, but in many cases the~e had been obliterated by the erosio11 of the shores, or destroyed by thoughtless or malicious persons. A sufficient numlJer, howeve1·, were recovered to serve as a basis for the new work and to permit of the rapid determination of tertiary points for the topographical and bydrographical parties. Assistant Wainwright first made a recounaissance of the ri\·e1· for the recovery of old points and the locatiou of new ones, and then erected the ne~essary signals. This was completed lJy the end of the montll, at which time he was joined by Messrs.RB. Derickson, F. F. Weld, and F. Douglas Sheetz, who had been assigned to the party as recorders. 'rhe triangulation naturally divided itself into two classes, that of the bay, with lines of sight from 5 to 18 miles in leugth, and that of the river, with lines varying from 1 to ·i miles. An effort was made to so arrange the work that the best weather should lJe utilized ou the long lines and tlle shorter ones being olJserved at any convenient interval, but unfortunately the atmospheric conditions were uniformly unfavorable throughout the season. 'rhe thick haze which constantly prevailed formecl au insuperalJle obstacle to the rapid prosecution of the work and proved very trying to the observers. Tlie triangulation of the river from Fort Carroll to the mouth presented no great dilliculties, the lines lJeing short, but the bay work was much retarded by the unfavorable weather conditions already mentioned. The scheme of triangulation followetl very closely that of the original survey of fifty years ago, but in most cases the old points were not recovered. Special attention was given to the marking of the new stations, so as to insure as far as possible their permanency and consequent availability for use in the future, and positions of points were furnished as promptly as was practicable to the topographic and hydrographic parties working in the vicinity. Tlte triangulation of the bay was connected with that of the transcontinental arc by 01Jservi11g upon '' Linst.id" and "Clough," two stations of the latter, from four of the bay stations, an<l upou "'rurkey Point" and "Still Pond" from "Pooles Island.'' The whole area covered by the triangulation presents little relief, and in cousequence many lJuihlings and other objects which would coustitute natural signals for the topogTnpher are nrnsked lJy trees a11d are invisible from the principal stations, but as many as were practicable were determined in lieu of temporary artificial signals. At North Point, which is noted for its miasmatic conditions, several members of the party suffered from malarial affections, and Assistant vVai11wright was so ill that he was compelled to apply for relief from duty for a period of two weeks, aud Assistant \Y. C. Hodgkins was detailed to take charge of the party during his absence. The season closed on the 9th of December, all the work laid out for the party having been completed except a portion of the olJservations at ·'Millers Island" which were not obtainable on account of the leugth of the lines and the impenetral>lo haze. The party was disbanded, and Messrs. Wainwright, Derickson, Weld, and Sheetz returned t-0 \Yashington, Foreman John Keuney remaining two days longer to attend to the proper housiug of tl1e uaphtha launch used for the transportation of the party 011 the field. Assistant Wainwright in his report commends all memlJers of the party for the zeal and efficiency displayed in the execution of tlwir respective duties, and attrilJut.es mnch of the success achieved in spite of adverse·circumstances to their hearty and intelligent cooperation.

His further services in connection with the laying out of the Chesapeake Bay speed trial course will be mcntioued under the head of Specia' Operations. Rf:survey of Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries-liydrorvaz1hy ht the vicinity of Baltimore Harbor· entmncc.-'l'he Rteamer Blake, under the command of Lieut. <Jornmander A. Dunlap, after the completion of surveys on the coast of Massachusetts, proceeded to CJhesapcake Bay for the purpose of making a hydrographical resurvey of the vicinity of Baltimore Harbor entrance, aud reached Baltimore on the 15th of November, 1896. Preparations for the execution of the survey W6re at once made, the first req uiremeut being the establishment of a tidal station; Bodkin Point and Seven Foot Knoll light-house, both proving unsuitable or impracticable, Sparrow Poi11t was finally selected, a11d there the tide gauge was set up and a reference bench mark establishe1l. The sounding work was then commenced and was carried on until the eud o1 uecember, when the severe cold weather compelled a temporary cessation. The work was resumed as soon as the weather conditions permitted and was still in progress at the close of the fiscal year. From March 17 to April 24, however, the work was interrupted by the laying out of the speed trial course (described under the head of Speci~I Operations), and from June 21 to 2H, inclusive, by the attendance of the Blake's party at the speed trial of the torpedo boat Foote.

It should also be mentionerl that in order to obtain a sufficient number of points for the execution of the hydrography, it was necessary to determine them by triangulation, as many of the stations of the old survey have been lost or obliterated. Ten observing tripods and scaffolds from 25 to 40 feet in height were erected, and from them and four additional stations horizontal angles were measured with a theodolite. The naval officers attached to the Blake <luring the work were as follows: Lieut. Commander A. Dunlap (in cornmaJHl), Lieut. ,J. A. Sherman (until January 8, when he was detached), Ensign .J. H. Reid, Ensign H. A. Wiley (until May 11, when he was transferred to the Bagre), Emiign F. B. Sullivan (from June 9 to June .'30), Ensign Powers Symington (from May 7 to June 1). Resun1ey o/Ohesapealce Bay-Trian[Julation anil topography of Clwstcr Riner, Jlfaryland.-Early in the fiscal year Assistant J. A. Flemcr was detailed to make a secondary triangulation of Chester Hiver, Maryland, from Deep Point to the month, to connect the same with the triangulation of ()hesapeake Bay, and to execute a topographical survey over the same limits. Leaving· Washington on the 11th of .July, Assistant Flemer, after purcbasing in Baltimore the necessary signal material, proceeded to East Neck Island, Kent County, l\Id., to make a rapid reconnaissance and to select a suitable stopping place for his party, and was there joined on the 13th by Messrs. G. \V. Nelson, F. O. S. Hunter, and J. J\L Slemous, who had been assigned to him as recorders and rodmen. By July 27 the signals needed for the work were located and erected, and the observation of horizontal angles was begun the following day at "Deep Point" station, the uppermost one of the ()bester Hiver series. By August 27 the eighteen stations comprising the scheme w·ere all occupied and "Love Point" was reached. It was expected that by the time these observations were completed the party under Assistant D. B. Waii1wright would lia.ve ~cached the mouth of the Patapsco and determined the line "Bodkin Point"-" Swan Point" as a base for the Chester River scheme, but delays caused by unfavorable atmospheric conditions had occurred, and the length an cl position of the required line was not yet determined. '.ro avoid further delay Assistant Flemer accepted the line "Bodkin Point"-" North Point" in lieu of the desired base, and reoccupied the terminal stations of his scheme for the additional angles necessary to make the new connection. The computatio11 of the triangulation was then made as rapidly as possible, and

meauwhile ::\Ir. G. \\'. Nelsou was engaged iu permanently marking the station poiuts. The topographical work was begun on the llith of September and carried 011 continuously until the 2Jth of November, when the setting iu of iuclement weather compelled the clisbaudmeut of tbe party. Assistant Flemer, after spending the remainder of the month in making descriptions and sketches of the tifang·ulatiou stations, returned to \Yashingtou, where he was engaged on office work and computations until again assigned to field duty. In his report Mr. I?lemer st1tcs that the weather during the season was geuerally favorable for topographic work, but that the smoky and hazy condition of the atmosphere greatly retarded the triangulation, especially when the longer lines of the Chesapeake Bay proper were reached.

UNITED STATES COAST A'°'D GEODETIC SURVEY.

From Sep~mber 5 to October 2:~ the party was engaged in rernlering assistance in signal building and in furnishing transportation to the triangulation party un<lcr the charge of Assistant J. B. Baylor·. On the 24th of October Lieutenant Tillrnan with his vessel proceeded to Baltimore and immediately beg,rn the construction and determination of signals for the resurvey of Baltimore entrance. 'l'llis work was completed on November 16, and preparations were then made for a systematic series of current observations in Chesapeake Bay. The actual observations began on the 5th of December, but in a few days were discontinued on account of tho lateness of tho season and the setting in of very inclement weather. 'l'he 11/atchlesN roached Washington 011the13th of December :ind remained until March 16, a hasty survey of the Washington Navy-Yard water front being made on the 13th. From March Hi until April 18 the party assisted in tho laying out of tho 24~ mile speed trial course in Chesapeake Bay, a full account of which will he found under the bead of Special Operntions, :wd then resumed the current observations in the vicinity of North Point, the tide gauge for the reduction of the work being previom;ly located at Sparrow Point. On the completion of this station similar observations were made until June 16 at a station :3fi miles east of Seven Foot Knoll Light, and subsequently at a channel station nine-tenths of a mile east by south from Sandy Point Light. The observations at the latter station were still in progress at the close of the fiscal year. 'Ihe following named officers comprised the party of the Matchless: Lieut. K ll. Tillman (in command), l'faval Cadet A. ,J. Wad hams, N antical Expert John Ross (detailed from the office August 2 to August 28), Pay Yeoman A. B. Camerden, and Ship's Writer .J. W. Clift. Pay Yeoman A. B. Camerden served as recorder, and Ship's ·writer ,J. W. Clift aud Carpenter's M;ite J\Iatt Solvin served as tidal observers. , Resttn1ey of Oltesapcalcc .Bay-Trianr1ulation of southern portiou.-On the 24th of July, 1896, Assistant ,J. B. Baylor was directed to proceed to the lower part of Chesapeake Bay, for the trigonometrical determination of the geographical positions of lighthouses and other inominent objects available for use in the topographic and hydrograpbic resurvey. Work was begun at Cape Henry, where both the old and new lighthouse towers were occupied, and angles of the main scheme were measured. A number of subsidiary points were also observed upon and the two towers were connected by a small triangulation, from a base of 250 metres measured for the purpose. The lighthouses at Old Point Comfort, Back River, and Cape Charles were then occupied. in succession, the progress of the work, however, being seriously retarded by the same unfavorable' weather conditions experienced by the other parties operating in this section of the country. The following additional lighthouses were observed upon but not occupied., as well as a number of prominent objects and artificial signals: Thimble Shoal, Old Plantation, Cape Charles (old), Newport News, Nansemond Uiver, New Point Comfort, arnl York Spit. From September 5 to October 23, Lieut. E. II. 'rillman, U. S. N., in command of the schooner ilfatchle.~s, assiste.d in erecting signals and searching for stations of the old triangulation, :rnd furnished transportation to the party, baving been directed to report to Assii:;taut Baylor for that purpose. The last observations at the new lighthouse at Cape Charles were made on ti.le Hth of November, and efforts to prosecute the work after this date proved futile, on account of the smoky an<l lmzy condition of the atmosphere. The season's worlc was therefore closed on tlie 7th of December, and Assistant Baylor returned to Washington, where he was engaged on his oflieo work and computations until again assigned to field duty. Latitude and magnetic determinations at Ronnrlhill and Lecsburr1, Va.-On Juue 21, 1897, Assistant C. H. Sinclair, in accordance with im;tructious, proceeded to Roundhill, Va., for the purpose of determiuing latitude and the magnetic declination, dip and intensity. Similar observations were t11en made at Leesburg, Va., and at the latter place stones were set to mark a meridian line. The magnetic observations occupied two days at each station. The latitude observations being primarily for the selection for tlle International Cieodeti~ Asll!Ociation of a :mitable station for the continued observation of variations of latitude, will be mention~d at greater length under tho head of ::;pecial Operations. Jlagnetic determinations anrl establi,y/mwnt of meridian line.~ <tt ·varioits point.~ in the State of Vfrginia.-On }fay 1, 1897, Assistant J. B.

I~icbmond, Va., for the purpose of determining the magnetic declination, dip and intensit;y, and

establishiug a meridian line for the benefit of local surveyors in testing and adjustiug their compasses. The ends of the meridian line were permanently marked by granite posts. Similar determinations of the magnetic elements were then made at Accomac Courthouse, Norfolk, and Greenville Courthouse, and meridian lines t->imilarly marked were also established at each of the points named. On the completion of this duty, on 1\lay 29, Assistant Baylor returned to Washington, and was engaged on office work a111l computations until the close of the fiscal year. Conti1wation and completion of the Udal record at Port Jloyal, S. C.-'l'he series of tidal observations, by means of the self-registeriug tide gauge, set up in April, lS!Ju, at the Port Hoyal NaYal Station, was continued during the present fiscal year until April, when it was completed. The tidal station was in charge of Mr. B. Vif. Weeks, who has now been transferred to the new tidal station at Fernandina, Fla. Ilydrographic rcsuney of Savannah River cntrance.-In January, 1897, the steamer }Jndcator, under the command of Lieut. J. ,J. Blandin, U. S. :N., having fitted out in Baltimore sailed for Savannah, Ga., for the purpose of making a resurvey of the outer bar and the entrance to the Savannah River. From .January 21 until February 8 the party was engaged in building and locating Rignals, determining positions of buoys and establishing tide gauges, and on the 9th the regular souuding work was begun. The area surveyed extends from outside the bar to the jetties and embraces the shoals to the northward and southward of the chaunels. The entrance to Calibogue Souml as far a8 Braddock Poiut was also surveyed. Considerable changes in the shore line have occurred since the old survey and numerous chang·es in the shoal~ to the southward and eastward of Braddock Point, to the southward and eastward of Daufuskie Island, and to the eastward of 'l'ybee Island, are reported. The grnat amount of stormy and foggy weather seriously retarded the progress of the work, and prevented as thorough an examination or the sl1oalR as would otherwise have been made, but the data secured are believed to be sufficient for the interests of navigation. The season's work closed on the 2flth of April aud the party returned to Baltimore on the 4th of l\fay. The stath;tics of the Savannah Hiver entrance work are as follows:

'l'he Endeavor is now en route to Buzzards Bay, l\Iassachusctts, having left Baltimore on June 28, and is now commanded by Lient. Uommander 0. F. Forse, U. S. N., who relieved Lieu tenant Blandin .June 18. Resurvey of Brunswick Bar, Georgia.-In accordance with the provisions of the river and harbor act of June 2, 18U6, a resurvey of the outer bar of Brunswick Harbor, Georgia, under the direction of the honorable the Secretary of War, by an officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, was required, and Lieut. Hobert G. Peck, U. S. N., in comwaud of the steamer Bache, was selected for this duty. For an account of the work see under the head of Special Operations. Geodetic connect·ion of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of Ploridn.-In the latter part of December, 1896, Assistant Herbert G. Ogden was directed to proceed to Florida for the purpose of connecting the triangulation of the east coast, in the neighborhood of Fernandina or Jacksonville, with that of the west coast at or uear Cedar Keys. · The method of accomplisl1ing this, by a scheme of triangulation or by a traverse line checked and controlled by astronomical azimuths, was to depend upon the physical conditions of the country, and a reconnaissance was therefore necessary to determine which was the most feasible and practicable. l\lr. Ogden left ·washington on the 31st of December and reachecl Jacksonville the following da~', and was there joined by Aid II. C. Denson, who had been assigned to the party. The old trigonometrical stations" l\foGirts Creek" and "Big· Creek" were recovered without difficulty, and the party was then organized on ,1 an nary 5 at Baldwin Junction. A preliminary examination of the country developed the fact that the

openiug of many liJJ.CS through heavy timber would be necessary to carry out a scheme of triangulation, and that the labor·and expense would cousel1uently be Yery gn!at. l<'urther iuvestigatiou showed that the roadbed of the railway afforded favorable opportunities for a traverse line, and. for direct measures of distances by means of a standardized steel tape. Some experimental measures were made over a distance of 3 miles, the tape being laid on the rails, to determine tile most favorable conditions, and whether by this method tile requisite degree of accuracy could be obtainetl. It was fouutl that the results were very satisfactory during cloudy weather, hut much less so during bright sunshine, and it wa~ subsequently decided, therefore, to make all the measures at night. :Meanwhile, two lines, 3~ and 4~ miles in length, had been 011e11cd from "Big Creek" to the raikoad, autl to save the time and expense incident to reobserving the line '' 1IcGirts "-:-''Big Creek" the work was based on "Big Creek" alone, the geographic positio11 being carried forward through an astronomical azimuth measured at Baldwin. Assistant A. L. Baldwin joined the party on the 1st of February and Mr. H.F. Flynn about tile middle of March, and _both rendered valuable a8sistance in the prosecution of the work, wilich was finally closed at Gainesville on the 24th of April. 'rhe distance traversed from BaJdwin to Gainesville was 52 miles, divided into kilometre sections, each section being measured at least twice. 'fhe measures were compared at each kilometre, and the discrepancies were generally Jess than one centimetre, and, further, it was fouud that the tendency throughout was for errors to compensate, the signs + and - being about equally distributed. 'l'he accumulated discrepancy in tho double measure of the 80 kilometres was only 12·1 centimetres. Assistant Ogden states that tile greatest source of error in such measures is undoubtedly tl1e uncertainty in the length of the tape, and tilat if this could be eliminated the resulting distance would be known within its oue one-hundred-thousandtll part. Including this and all other known sources of error; ilowever, ho still claims that the distance measured is known within it.s one tilirty-thousandth part, a degree of accuracy at least equal to that obtainable from a small triangulation. · At Gainesville tile work was connecte<l with the court-house spire, which had previously been referred to an astronomical station, and the levch; brought up from Jacksonville were referred to the primary bench mark It of the precise level line. 'fhe azimuth 6f the traverse line was further checked by a new azimuth measured at \Valdo, the agreement of the latter with that brought forward from Baldwin proving very satisfactory. Assistant Ogden, in his report, highly commends the services rendered hy Messrs. Baldwin, Denson, and Flynn, whose zeal and energy contributed much to the success of the work. He also acknowledges his obligations to the officials of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad for many courtesies aud privileges extended, whicil greatly facilitated the operations of the party.

'l'he accou11t of the work will be found in the uext paragraph . .Establishment of a tidal stntion at Ferna.ndina, Fla . ...._In the latter part of April, 1897, Assist· ant Herbert G. Ogden, on the completion of the peninsular work above described, detailed Assistant .A. J,, Baldwin to attend to the establishment of a permanent tidal station at Fernandina. l\Ir. Baldwin reached Fernandina on the 29th, and immediately made a reconnaissance of the water front for the selection of a suitable site for the station, the old site at the foot of Beech street being impracticable because of extensive improvements about to be made, and also on account of t110 continued shoaling of the east side of tbe river. The most suitable site was foui1d to be at the south end of the Florida Central and I>cninsular Railroad wharf, at the foot of Dade

street, and through the kindness of the onicials of the company he was permitted to utilize this point. A small tide house was ereeted witliout delay, atHl the self-registering gauge was set up witliin it and put in working order by l\fay 8. The station was then placed in charge of 'fidal Observer B. \V. \Veeks, who had arrived a few days previously, and the series of observations was begun. A tide stafi was also prepared and fastened securely to a pile, the relation of its zero to that of the automatic gauge being aceurately determined. The staff was also referred by leveling to bench mark A, the only one of the beucli marks of 1877 still in existence, and to three new bench marks established by Assistant Baldwin in different parts of the city. On the completion of this work l\Ir. Baluwin returned to ·washington, reporting for further duty on l\lay 13. Oontinuation of the triangulation of the obliq1le arc in Alabama.-Early in l\larch, 1897, Assistant ¥V. B. Fairfield was dir~cted to prepare for the resumption of the work on the triangulation of the oblique arc in soutllwesteru Alabama, and immediately detailed Foreman ,Jasper Bilby to visit and inspect the various signals, post the lamps, a!ld prepare the stations for occupation. This preparatory work was cpmpleted by the 29th, and on the same date Assistant Fairfield arrived at Mobile. Observations were begun at "Spring Hill" station on the 4th of April, but the progress from that date to l\1ay 15 was slow on account of the dense smoke arising from forest fires, which frequently made the signal lights of distant stations invisible. After this the atmosphel'ic condition~ became more favorable aDd the work progressed rapidly, and by June 20 the final observations at Fort Morg·an were completed. In order to avoid expensive cutting of vistas through the forests on the lines "Spring Hill"-'' Fort Morgan," "Spring Hill"-" St. Elmo," and "Fort Morgan"-" St. Elmo," the lights at those stations were given additional elevations of from 24 to 45 feet, making their tot.al heights above the gTound 165 feet, 144 feet, and 80 feet, respec· tively. An 82-foot pole was also erected over the transit pier of the old astronomical station in Bienville square, l\Iobile, which was thus connected with the triangulation, as were also a 1111mber of prominent objects, such as church spires, etc. Owing to the carelessness of the light tender at "Spring Hill," two of the safety lamps were completely destroyed by fire, but fortunately 110 serious damage was done to the signal. The number of stations occupied, ending with Fort Morgan, was thirteen, and the observations at the latter point completed the work originally contemplated; but, in accordance with supplemental· ins.tructions, Assistant Fairfield, on the 23d of Jun.e, began a search for old trigonometrical points on Mississippi Sound, with a view of connecting the triangulation of that region, executed in 1847, with that just completed at Fort Morgan. 'l'he first points visited were" Petit Bois" and "Bast Pascagoula," and in both cases the search for the old stations was unsuccessful, the ground marks having been obliterated, the first by the shifting of the sand hills, and the second by the encroachment of the sea. '.l'he party being still in the field at the close of the fiscal year, the further account of the recovery of ol1l points and their connection with the oblique arc triaugulation will appear in my next report. In his report Assistant Fairfield acknowledges his indebtedness to J1aj. W. T. Rossell, of the United States Engineer Corps, who kindly furnished transportation to aud from Fort Jforgan at all times to members of the party, aud also for all outfit, supplies, and lumber. · Foreman Jasper S. Bilby performed his duties during the season in his usual thorough and efficient manner, and was an invaluable member of tlie party. l'recise lc1,cli11g in Nississippi-Yickslntrg to Jlleridian.-ln order to further connect the lines of' l>recise levels from New Orleans to St. Louis aud from Mobile to Odin and complete the system of loops or circuits introduced as checks, the line between Vicksburg and Meridian, l\1iss., was required, and Assistant Isaac Winston was directed to execute the work. He left Washington on the 2d of November, 189G, and immediately organized a party at Vicksburg. The work began on the Louisiana side of the river, and the first operation therefore was the leveling across the stre~m, and this was much facilitated by the courtesy of l\1a:j. ,J. H. \Villard, United St~tes Engmeers, in charge of the improvement of navigation in that region, who kindly placed boats and a small steamer at the disposal of the party. The river crossing was made in the usual mam1e1:i repeated observations in both directions being made to eliminate the effect of atmospheric refract1011, and the method of observing throughout the line of levels was that customarily followed, viz, that known as the double simultaneous line method. The starting point on the

Louisiana shore was bench mark 211, established by Assistant J. B. Weir in 1880, and various bench marks established by .i\1ajor Willard's party on both sides of the river were connected with. 'fhe line from Vick burg to Meridian followed the roadbed of the Alabama and Vicksburg Railroad, and no special difficulties were encountered. Permanent bench marks were established in all towns and villages where a suitable place could be found, and these are all carefully described in the records. The use of the velocipede cars, kindly permitted by the railway officials, greatly facilitatell the rapid progress of the work and added to the comfort of the party. 1\Ir. \-Villiam Bowie served as recorder from the beginning of the season until December :n, when he was assigned to other duty. He was succeeded by Mr. 0. B. Strong, who served to the close of the season. The line was completed to Meridian, a distance of 236 kilometres, by February 7, aud the party was then disbanded and Assistant 'Winston 'returned to Washington, where he was engaged on his office work and computations until directed to resume work in Kansas on the transcontinental line of levels. Mr. Winston in his report expresses his high appreciation of.the courtesies extended hy Maj. J. H. Willard and the valuable assistance rendered by Assistant Engineer G. 0.

Survc11 of Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana-Triangulation, topography, and hydrography.-In the latter part of December, 1896, Assistant P.A. Welker, in accordance with pi:evious instructions, proceeded to New Orleans, La., and organized a party for the continuation of the survey of Lake Pontchartrain. The schooner Qniclc and a naphtha launch were turned over to his charge, and Assistants .John Nelson, H.. L. Faris, and F. A. Young, and Hecorder .Tobu Lord Nisbet were assigned to the party. The field operations began early in .January, a detached party under the charge of Assistant Nelson, with quarter8 on shore, executing the topography in the vicinity of "\Vest End, Frenier, and H.ucl<lock, and the main party on the schooner operating in other localities. The weather was unusually stormy, rainy, and foggy, and much delay was thereby occasioned, but by February 17 the topography from West End to Pass l\fanchac was completed. By the end of Fcbrnary the bydrographie signals were erected and the sounding work was in progress. This work was also much delayed by the continuance of unfavorable weather. and frequently signals were washed away by the high water in the swamps and the heavy seas of the lake. On one occasion the naphtha. launch was swamped, and sank in 12 feet of water, but was subsequently raised without serious damage; a plane table and alidade, however, were not recovered. Lake Pontchartrain is a large body of water, and in severe storms, which are frequent at this season of the year, the seas are quite heavy. Work was carried on on m;iny days at considerable risk, but, as Assistant Welker states in bis report, without rmming such risks but little could liave been accomplished. The hydrography was discontinued at the entl of April, and the remainder of the season was spent in determining points for the continuance of the work to the eastward next season. Tides were observed at three stations during the progress of the hydrographic work, self.registering gauges having been erected at West End and Pass Manchac and an ordinary staff gauge near the mouth of Bayou le Branche. On May 15 the party was disbanded and Assistants \.Yelker, Nelson, Young, and Faris returned to \Vashingtou, and were engaged on their ollice work m1til again assigned to field duty. Jn his report Assistant Welker acknowledges the vahrn.ble and efficient service rendered during the season by all members of his party.

At the close of the fiscal year Assistant Welker was at Salt Lake City preparing for reconua1ssauce and trian.gulation in the States of Utah, Nevada, and Idaho. H!Jdrographic survey at the mouth of Brazos River, Texas.-See under head of" Special operations." 1lfaynetic observations at various points in the Centrtil and Northwestern Stntes.-At the closing of the last fiscal year Assistant R L. Faris was engaged in determining the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity at various points in the Central and Northwestern States, and my last report gives a list of twenty-four stations completed by June 30, 189G. The work was continued into the present .fismtl year, five additional stations in l\iontana and North Dakota being completed by .July 15, when the season's work closed. '.l'he five stations occupied this year are Havre aml Glasgow, l\Iont., and W~lliston, Itngb_y, and Pembina, N. Dak. One or two days' observations were ·made at each statiou, according· to the requirements, together with the necessary determinations of time, latitude, and azimuth. lt was intended that the longitudes should be determined chronometrically, but on reducing the observations it was found that the ''traveling rate" of the chronometer was too variable and uucertaiu, and the values had therefore to be derived from the best authenticated maps of the General Land Office. All stations wern so selected as to be free from local artificial disturbing causes, and were carefully marked, and their descriptions have been filed in the archives of the Survey for future refere11ce. Mr. Faris, on the completion of the field work, returned to \Vashiagton and was occupied until August 17 in computing the results. In this he was aided by Assistant A. L. llald win. Continuation of t!te tra1uwontincntal line of precise levels in KansaB.-As stated in my last report, Assistant Ieaac Winston, under instructions to resume the work on the transcontinental line of levels, reaehed Salina, Kans., on June 30. The party, consisting of a recorder, two rodmen, and two hands, was at once organized and active operations began July 2. 'rbe route followed was along the Union Pacific Hailroad, and the usual practice of locating permanent bench marks on suitable buildings in the t-0wns and villages alo11g the route was followed. The m.;e of the velocipede cars for the transportation of the party, and the tent observing car described in a previous report, was not permitted by the railroad officials, and this caused considerable delay and i11co11venience to the party. The strong winds that so pei·sistently prevail in this region also caused much delay and occasionally prevented work entirely. A large umbrella was used as a wind-break, as well as to shade the in::;trurnent from the sun, and it was frequently necessary during observations to steady the rods by means of guys. During the progress of the work connection was made with the two ends of tlie "Hussell I.Jase" and with two other stations of the transcontinental tl'iangulatiou along the thirty-ninth parallel, thus furnishing a valuable chl!ck 011 the elevations determined through the triangulation by vertical angles. The river-gauge bench mark of the United States Geological Survey, at Ellsworth, was also connected with the line of level::;. On the 10th of September the season's work closed at Ellis, Kaus., a distance of 187 kilometres from Salina. Assistant vVinston, after the disbandment of the party, proceeded as far westward as Denver

for the purpose of examining the facilities available for the further prosecution of the line and determining tlie party outfit requisite. The country is sparsely settled aud at many points it will be diflicnlt if not impossible to secure lodging places for the party, and the use of' tents will probably be a necessity. At Denver Mr. Winston arranged for the preparation of stone bench marks for future use, an<l then returned to Washington by way of Omaha, stopping at the latter place to confer with the railroad officials in regard to the use of the velocipede cars. Mr. B. 0. Strong served as recorder dnring the season, and l\Iessrs. 0. C. Orew and H. 'V. Wagner as rodmen. The statistics of the work are as follows:

The snl>sequent services of Assistant Winston in :.\-lississippi and Kansas are noticed elsewhere in this report. Resumption of the transcontinental line of precise levcl8 in Kan8as in the spl"ing of 1R97.-0n June 7, 1897, Assistant Isaac Winston, in 'accordance with instructions, left Washington and proceeded to Ellis, Kans., for the purpose of continuing work on the transcontinental line of precise levels. A party was at once' organized, and l>y the end of the month 44 kilometres of double line were completed. The party l>eing still in the field at tbe close of the fiscal year, tbe results of the season's work will be given in the report for 18!.18. Transcontinental geodetic w01·k-Jlfea.mrernent of the "Sa.Una base," Jla.nsas.-At the close of the fiscal year 1896 the party, under the direction of Assistant F: D. Granger, hatl completed the trigonometrical work necessary to connect the "Salina lJase" with the main transcontinental triangulation, and the clearing, grading, and general preparation of the line and the actual measurement of the base was then in progress. 'l'he base measure, supplemented by astronomical observations for time, latitude, and azimuth, was continued <luring the present fiscal year until August 11; when, the work being satisfactorily completed, field operations in this locality closed and the party was assigned to other duty. The l>ase line is located in the valley of the Salina l{iver, about 80 feet :q.orth of and nearly parallel to the track of the Union Pacific l{ailroad between Salina and New Cambria. Its west entl is situated in North Salina, on land owned l>y the city, and its east end about a mile west of New Cambria, on private property, the length of the line being a little overG~ kilometres. BeginHiug at the west end, the line crosses a wheat field and enters the Sali1ia aud New Cambria wagon road at a lJOint 870 metres east of" West Base,'' then follows along on the north side of the road for a distance of 5 165 metres, and finally crosses 517 metres of cultivated land to "East Base." The general character of the ground is smooth and hard, and at no point is it much broken or very irregular. The direction of the line from "West Base" is north Ci8°·36' east, and the land slopes gently to the east, the diflerence of elevation of the base terminals being 20 feet. At a distance of 6 110 metres from" West Rase" a small gully had to be bridged over, owing to the wet and muddy condition of the ground, but no other obstructions were met except near the east entl where some wire fences were encountered. Section stones were set at distances of 1 kilometre throughout the line and carefully aligned. These were limestone posts 2 feet long an<l G inches square, aud were ~et in cement, with their tops 4 inches below the surface of the ground, and in tho top of each stone was inserted a copper bolt with fine cross lines drawn upon it~ head. Preliminary measures of the base were made with a.steel tape and the grades were acenrately determined l>y lines of levels; the final measures were made with the secondary contact.slide l>ars Nos. 13 and 14, which had recently been restandurdized by the Ollice of Standard Weights and Measures. Intense beat and frequent rains interfered with the rapid prosecution of the work, the former cause finally tiecessitating the abandonment of afternoon operations and working only from early morning until noon. Two satisfactory measures were completed l>y .Tuly 23, and the ends of the base were then marked by suitable monuments. The underground marks (at each end of the base) are cross lines on the heads of copper bolts inserted in stone posts and sunk 2~ feet below the surface of the ground, and the surface

30

marks are similarly marked copper lJolts inserted in liliiestone bloek::i 33 inches square lJy 25 illches high. '£hese monuments rest in concmte lwds placed (j inches alJove the subsurface marks, the concrete l>l~ds having central apertures 8 inches square so that the underground marks may be readily accessible when necessary, and each monument bears on its upper surface the i11scription U.S. U. & G. Surrny, 18DG . .After the completio11 of the lJase measure, time, latitude, and azimuth determinations were made at" vVest Base," and lines of levels were run to connect west and east bases with the nearest lJench marks of the transcontinental line, located at Salina and New Camllria, respectively. Assistant Granger then reduced his party and proceeded to execute a reconnaissance in Nellraska aud northern Kansas, which will lJe treated of in another paragraph. On the Salina base work l\Ir. Granger was assisted by Assistants "\V. C. Hodgkins, A. L. Bal<lwin, and E. 13. Latham, aml Foreman E. E. Torrey, and all performed their various duties in a very satisfactory manner. On the couclusion of the work Messrs. llodgkius and Baldwin returned to Washington, and Messrs. Latham and Torrey accompanied Assistant Granger on the Nebraska reconnaissance.

Reconnaissance in Nebraska and northern Kansas.-Under instructions of July 14, 189G, Assistant F. D. Grauger, Oil the completion of the Salina llase measurement in August, proceeded to make a reconnaissance through N elJraska aud northern Kansas for the purpose of laying out a suitallle scheme of triangulatiou for the determiuation of points for State surrnys in the former. Accompanied by Assistant E. B. Latham, Mr. K E. Torrey, and a driver, Assistant Granger left Salina on the 17th of August, his outfit consisting of two horses and a wagon, and tlre necessary instruments. Later in the season this was increased lJy an additioual wagon and pair of horses. A wide belt of cou,ntry in the vicinity of the ninety-eighth meridian was examined as far north as O'Neill, the principal points touched at en route lleing Minneapolis, Glasco, Beloit, and Maukato in Kansas, a11d l{ed Cloud, Blue Hill, Hastings, Grand Island, Elbe, St. Paul, Brayton, Loup City, Ord, Ericson, Bartlett, Albion, Neligh, Ewi11g, and O'Neill, in Nebraska. 'l'he fact was developed that a fair scheme of triangulation southward from Niobrara, on the northern Nebraska boundary, to the transcontinental liue, was practicalJle, but that tlte country soml·what to the westward was more favoralllo and ottered better facilities for larger figures. The general character of the country traversed is rolling, but here and there, especially in the vicinity of tbe rivers, wide belts of sand are encountered, and between them areas of clayish soil. The sandy regions abound in clusters of sand dunes, varying in height from a fow feet to 75 feet. The:se hillocks are of a sliifting nature and are principally found near and to the southward of the numerous streams which flow in an easterly direction through the State. "Blowouts," as they are locally termed, are noticeable in many of these hillock1:1, usually Oil the west and northwest sides, sometimes attaining a depth of 15 or :!O feet and doubtless frequeutly resulting in the complete demolition of the dunes. A growth of rank grass teuds to preserve the hillocks in the forms tbey have assumed until a "blowout" is started at some vulnerable point by an unusually severe wiud, and then the excavation increases rapidly until the close of the windy season, when a fresh growth of grass may check it temporarily. About 25 per cent of the land in the clayish sections is under cultivation, the crops being principally beets, corn, wheat, oats, and millet, and vast qu:111tities of bay are cut from the meadow lands adjacent to the streams. Clusters of cottonwood t1·ees are found in the meadows and along tbe lJorders of streams and seem to thrive well, lJut on the prairies proper, 100 or 200 feet al.love tbe level of the river vallt,ys, few trees are found, and those of stunted growth. The southern portion of th(l State of Nebraska is quite well settled and fairly well supplied with traus1mrtation facilities, but farther north, between the North Loup and Elkhorn rivers, through the counties of Greeley, -wheeler~ Garfield, and Holt, the means of transportation are meager, and the country is sparsely settled. The principal streams crossiug the parts of the State examined are

the Blue, Platte, South Loup, North Loup, Elkl10rn, Niobrara, and Missouri rivers, and all of them ffow iu an easterly direction. 'l'he preliminary examination ended at O'Neill in the l~tter part of September, and Assistant Granger then slowly retraced his steps, selecting tlie points most available for the scl!eme of triangulation and determining· the approximate distances and elevations. A scheme was finally perfected as far south as Lowell-Prosser, the average length of the triangfo sides being ~O miles, and only one point requiring a height of signal as great as 50 feet. Assistant Granger also selected a site for a base line in Nebraska, au admirable location being found between the towns of Gibbon and Sheldon. The proposed line is about 92 kilometres in length aud lies north of aud parallel to the track of the Union Pacific H.ailroad. 'fhe ground is smooth aud the grade slight and uniform, the difference of elevation of the base terminals not exceeding 15 or ~O feet, and moreover, the simplicity of the conuection with the triangulation scheme is all that could be desired, no auxiliary stations being required for expausiou. Assistaut Granger found that this ::;ite presented so many advantages, and was so much superior to any other that could be found farther north, that he strongly recommends its adoption, although the distance from tile Salina base is less than was desired, viz, 135 miles instead of WO. 'l'he season's work closed on the 9th of November and the party was disbanded, Assistants Grauger and Latham returning to Washington where they were eug·aged on oftice work until again assigned to field duty. Assistant Granger in his report highly commends the service rendered by Assistant Latham and Mr. E. E. Torrey, throughout the reco1mai::;sauce. 'l.'he statistics of the work are a::; follows:

}1,csnmption of the reconnaissance in Nebraska and nortlu:rn Kansa.~ i11 the spring of 18.'J7.-Ear1y in April, 18!}7, Assistant F. D. Oranger made arrangements for the continuation of the Nebraska and Kansas reconnaissance, and by the 10th the party was organized and active field operations begun. Starting from the line Lowell-Prosser: the southernmost points of the previous sea.sou's work, the reconnaissance was carried through southern Nebraska and uortheru Kansas until a junction witll the t.ranscoutinental arc at the stations Meade's J{anch and Waldo was effected. 'l'llis was accomplished by .June !W and immediate preparatious were then made for the execution of the triaugulatiou. 'J'he erection of the necessary signals at Waldo, Meade's Hauch, Dial, Kill Creek, Lawrence, and Old Well was begun and was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. Assistant Granger has submitted complete reports o,f the work execnte<l, accompanied by sketches showing the scheme of triangulation laid on t from the reconnaissance, the approximate elevation of each point selected, and the height of signal necessary to secure intervisibility and ensure rapidity of the angnlar measures. Foreman E. B. 'l'orrey i::; agaiu serving in the party in his u::;ual efficient and hig·hly satisfactory manner.

'J.'ranscontinental trianr1ulation-Afoa.mre111ent of the "Versailles base'," .illissouri.-In May, 1897,

Assistant A. L. Baldwin, in acconlance with iustrnctions, proceeded to Versailles, Mo., for the purpose <>Teat transcontinental arc. The base line . of . measuring a verification base line for the ,.., was ongmally laid out in 1878 by Assistant ,J. A. Sullivan aud its terminals were occupied a.s primary stations in 1880 by Assistant F. D. Granger, but it had never been measured. It is situated 011 the divide between the Missouri and Osage rivers, and near tile town of Versailles, aud forms a side of one of the figures of the transconti11ental chaiu of trialigulation. Its leugth is about 7 650 metres. 'J:he measurement was made by means of a standardized 50-metre steel tape,

32

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

and in the work Assistant Baldwin was aided by .Assistant R. L. Faris, Computer H. F. Flynn, and Recorders D. ·w. Baton and J>aul F. Ehrhard. The leveling for profile of the line and also for its connection with the nearest bench mark of tho transcontinental line of levels, 20 miles distant at Tipton, Mo., was executed by Messrs. Flynn and Eaton. Marking stakes were set up throughout the line at distances of 50 metres, with intermediate support stakes for the tape. These were all carefully aligned, and adjusted as to elevation, and a constant tension, regulated by a standarized spring balance, was applied to the tape throughout the mea~mres. The measurements, one iu each direction, were made at night, so as to secure the most favorable conditions, but 3 kilometres were subsequently measured also by day, in order to deduce the relative effects of rising and falling temperatures. One kilometre of the line was also measured three times by means of the secondary base bars, so that the constancy of the valne of the tape could be frequently tested. The base measure was satisfactorily completed by June 30, when the party was disbanded and Assistant Baldwin returned to Washington. :Messrs. Faris and Flynn, in accordance with instructions, remained behind for the execution of a reconnaissance to the southward of the Versailles biise. This work belonging entirely to the next fiscal year will be treated of in my next report.

Progress Sketches, showing the localities of field work in the Western Division, are given at the close of Part I. Continuation of the topographic res1w1:ey of San Fra.ncii;co Bay and Harbor.-Thc topographic resurvey of San Francisco Bay and Harbor was continue<l during the greater part of the year under the general direction of Assistant A. F. Hodgers, tlrn party being under the immediate charge alternately of Mr. Ferdinand Westdahl or Assistant Fremont :Morse, as the execution of other duties permitted. Good. progress was made until the end of December, when the field operations were temporarily suspended on account of inclement weather. The work was again resumed al>out the middle of l\Iarch and continued to the close of the fiscal year. The incidental triangulation to determine points in San Francisco and San Pablo bays for the topographic and hydrographic parties was executed at various tlmes by Assistants .l. J·. Gilbert and E. F. Dickius, as opportunity occurred, they being also occupied with the computation, etc., relating to their own field work elsewhere. Assistant Gilbert also in February and March ran a line of spirit levels from the bench marks at the Union Iron Works to the southern extremity of San Francisco nay, establishing intermediate bench marks at South ~an Francisco, Milbrae, Burlingame, San Mateo, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Ravenswood, Alviso, and San Jose, and in April began a line of levels from Sausalito to Benicia. 'l'he former line embraced a distance of 56 miles, and the latter, to the point reached by Assistant Gilbert, of about 40 miles. 'fhe leveling work was suspended April 24 to enable Assistant Gilbert to prepare for the resumption of his regular field work in Washington Sound, but the line was subsequently completed by Mr. F. \V. Edmonds. The statistics of the San Francisco Bay work, tria11gulatio11, topography, and leYelin~ are as follows:

Assistant Hodgers also retained charge during the year of the sulJoflice at San Francisco, but fo~ short periods, when absent on other otllcial business, was relieved temporarily by Assistants Gilbert or Dickins. He also had general charge of the tidal olJservations at Sausalito station, t~e const~uction and determination of the new observatory at Presidio, the construction of a uew tulal station at the same place, and served for a time as member of the Santa Monica-Sau Pedro Deep Water Harbor Boa.rd. During the year the following operations or inyestigations in addition to those already mentioned were carried on: In October Mr. Ferdinand Westdahl was detailed to determine the positions of reported rock breaks in the sea approaches to Coquille H1ver, Oregon. In December, at tbe request of the pilot commissioners of the port of San Francisco, Mr. Ferdinand

. . W estdahl and Assistant 0. B. French made an examination of the "Cestissima Hock," in the

Bonita or North Channel. In February, at the request of Col. W. I~. Shaffer, U. S. A., commanding at the Presidio, Assistant Fremont Morse was detailed to determine the geographical position and elevation of the Lewis range finder, located on the heights above the l<'ort Point. In Apnl Assistant E. F. Dickins was detailed to assist Lieut. James l\l. Helm, U.S. N., commanding the steamer McArtlwr, in determining range stations to be used in determining compass deviations. In the same month .i\lt. Frank W. Edmonds, at the request ot' Capt. Sedgwick Pratt, U. S. A., the corumaudiug oflicer at Fort Mason, was detailed to run a line of levels from the b~nch mark at tlle Presidio to one located 011 the parapet of the fort. In May Assistant K F. Dickins was detailed to determine stations for a 1-mile tria I course for naval vessels iu the viciuity of Ange~ Island and Bluff Point, San Francisco Bay. 'rhe tidal observatious at Sausalito and the Coquille Hiver examination are mentioned more fully in separate paragraphs. Continuation of the hydrographic resurvey of Sa.n l?ninci.~co Bay and Ha.rbor.-The hydrographic resurvey of San Francisco Bay and Harbor was continued during the year by tlie parties of the steamers Gedney and McArthiw, the former under the command of liieut. Commander A. P. Osborn, U.S. N., and the latter under the command successively of Lieuts .·James H. Sears and J. M. Helm. 'rhe triangulation for the determination of the necessary points for the survey was executed by Assistants J. J. Gilbert and E. F. Dickins, who were detailed for that purpose by Assistant A. F. Rodgers. The steamer Gedney was engaged ou the resurvey of San Pablo Bay from July 6 to November 17, 1896, when she proceeded to Oakland for repairs. From December 13, 18!.IG, to February 27, 1897, the party was engaged. under the direction of the Santa Monica-San Pedro Deep Water Harbor Board, in making a 11ydrographie examination of San Pedro and Santa 1\Ionica bays and a hydrographic survey of the imrnr harbor of San Pedro. On the completion of this work the San Pablo Bay survey was resumed, but was again discontinued on l\fay 11, for the plll'pose of laying out a 1-mile speed-trial course in San Francisco Bay. On June 21 the Gedney was, by the direction of tlie honorable Secretary of the 'rreasury, placed at the disposal of the president of the Leland Stanford University for the purpose of carrying a party of scientists to Guadalupe Island, on the· northwest coast of Mexico, to investigate the seal rookeries in that region. This duty was completed by July 1, and the party then returned to San Francisco. The statistics of the Gedn.ey's work in San Pablo Bay are as follows:

'l'be statistics of the Santa Monica and San Pedro surveys will be given under the head of Special Overations. The steamer 1llcArthur was engaged on the further development of Bonita Channel and the Golden Gate, that portion of San Francisco Bay between the city and Alcatraz Island on tlte west and Oakland and West Berkeley on the east, and since the middle of April, 18!l7, on the eastern shore of the bay betwee11 Thompsons Landing and Potrero Point. A number of dangers to navigation were discovered and located, and numerous ranges in and about San Francisco, for use in the determination of compass deviations, were established.

Continuation of the tidnl record at the Sausalito (San Fmncisco Uay) '/1idul Station.-'rlie selfregistering tide gauge at the Sausalito Tidal Station, under the supervision of Assistant A. F. Jfodgers, continued in successful operation througl10ut the year, and an unbroken record has been received. l\ir. ll. S. Ballard served as tidal observer. Arraugemeuts have, however, been made for the remo\·al of tile station to Pre::;idio, where a favorable site has been selected, and the construction of the building well atlvauced toward completion. The observations at the new station will begin early iu the next fiscal year. Determination of the latitude anrl longitude of the new "Presidio Astronomical 8la.tion," San Prancisco, Cal.-lu the latter part of October, 189G, Assistant A. F. Hodgers, in charge of the topographical resurvey of San Francisco Bay and Harbor, detailed Assistants Fremont l\Iorse aud 0. Il. French to determine the telegraphic difference of longitude between the old astronomical observatory iu Lafayette Park aud the new one located in the Presidio Military Reservation, and Assistant li'rench was also directed to determine the latitude of the new observatory. It was the intention to begin the longitude work on the 1st of November, l>ut on conferring with the ::;uper· intendent of the Western Union Telegraph Company, it was found impracticable to secure the use of the wires at that time on account of the press of business due to tlrn approaching Presidential election. On tlte 7tlt, ltowever, the line was placed at the disposal of the party and observations were begun tllat nigltt. From some unexplained cause, ltowever, the wires were not in working order when the time for the exchange of signals anived, but as the sky clouded over about the sa.me time, the observations would have IJeen lost anyway. The line again failed on tlte 10th, and it was not until the night of the 11th tltat a full set of observations at l.ioth stations were obtained. Assistant Morse first occupied the Lafayette Park Station and Assistant French the Presidio Station, and complete observations and exchanges were obtained on ten nights, the observers interchanging stations in the middle of the series to eliminate personal equation effocts from the final result. 'l'he uigllts of complete observations were November 11. 12, 13, 14, 20, 25, 27, 28, !..!9, and 30, cloudy weather preventing work on the intervening dittes. '.l'lte resulting difference of longitude between the two observatories from Assistant Morse's field computation is 0 11 .. 00 111 05··U50±0"·007!i. The latitude observations at the Presidio Station were made l>y Assistant French on six nights, twenty-seven pairs of stars being used on each occasion. l':enith telescope No. 3 was used and careful redeterminations of level and micrometer values were made. On the completion of the observations Assistant Morse resumed work on the San Francisco Bay resurvey, and Assistaut French was granted leave of absence tiutil December 20, when he was directed to make a magnetic survey of southern California. This work will lie reported in anotlter paragraph. 1lfognet-ic cl<:tc1·minatio11s in the State of C<tUforni<i.-In October, 189G, Assistant II. P. Hitter was directed to prepare for magnetic determinations in California, and left Sau Francisco 011 the 15th of the following month. Observations for declination, dip, and intensity, with tlte iucideutal determinations of time and azimuth were made at thirty stations distl'ibuted over a territory 300 miles in length by 100 miles in width, or an area of 30 000 square miles, including the wester1i part of the State from San Francisco to Los .Angeles, the San Joaquin\' alley, and the northern part of tl1e Mojave Desert. The stations determined were tlie following and were occupied in the order given: San Jose, Hollister, Santa Cruz, Salinas, Soledad, San Lucas, Bradley, Santa. l\fargarita, Port llarford, Santa Maria, Los Olivos, Santa Barbara, Ventura, Saugus, Palmdale, l\l~jave, Caliente, Asphalto, Delano, Visalia, Huron, Fresno, l\fondota, Volta, l\ladera1 Merced, Modesto, Altamont, Milton, and Stockton. One day's observation of each element was made at each station, except San Jose and Santa Barbara, where two days' observations were required. All stations were carefully marked for future reference, and full descriptions of each are deposited in the archives of the Survey, with the records of tlte observations. Great care was also exercised in the selection of station sites, so us have them free from present disturbing influences or probalJle future ones. 'l'he azimuth marks were usually prominent and well-defined objects, and these were also referred by angular memmres to other promineut objects whenever practicable. The olJservations began on the IGth of November and were completed on the 30th of March.

Assistant Ritter then returned to San Francisco and was engaged on bis office work and computations until again assigned to similar field duty in June. On June 11 be again left San Francisco and proceeded to Santa Hosa, the county seat of Sonoma County, where the magnetic elements were determined aud a meridian line, marked by granite posts, was established. Similar observations were then made at Napa, the county seat of Napa County, but for lack of time no meridian line was est(abhshed. The azimuths of a number of well-defined objects were determined, however, so that the meridian line can readily be marked at any time in the future. Assistant Ritter returned to San Francisco on the 30th of June and resumed his unti'uished computations and duplication of records. ~Magnetic observations at eighteen stations in southern Oalijornia.-Early in January, 1897, Assistant 0. B. French, in accordance with previous instructions, began a magnetic survey of southern California, the magnetic elements, declination, dip, and intensity being determined at each station ou from one to three days, according to the requirements. Auxiliary astronomical observations for time, latitude, and aJ1imuth were observed at all stations ancl the longitudes were obtained chronometrically. Stations were selected with a view to permanency and, as far as possible, free from local artificial disturbing causes, both present and prospectiv-0, and were marked by stone or redwood posts bearing suitable inscriptions. The azimuth marks were also carefully selected and as a precautionary measure these were usually referred to other prominent objects by angular measures with the theodolite. The principal instrumental constants, except the temperature and induction coefficients, were redetermined twice during the season. The following is a list of the eighteen stations determined, named in the order of their occupation: Kramer, Barstow, Bagdad, Mauvel, Blake, Oro Grande, San Bernardino, North Pomona, Santa Monica, San Pedro, Newport Beach, Capistrano, Oceanside, Laplaya, Foster, San Jacinto, Elsinore, and Indio. The field work was completed on the 4th of March, and Mr. French then returned. to Washington and was engaged at the office until the latter part of April in computing his results and completing the records. He was then assigned to other field duty (telegraphic longitude and magnetic work) in Delaware, which has already been mentioned under_ the h~ad of '' Bastern Division." Trian,qulation in soutlumi Oal{foniia.-At the beginning of the fiscal year Assistant E. F. Dickins was making preparations for the execution of a triangulation to connect the Los Angeles base line with the primary triangulation of the State. He organized his party, consisting of a recorder and three men, at San Francisco, and after shipping the uecessary instruments and the wag·ons and camp outfit, which had been stored at Eureka, started for San Pedro on the 18th of July. "San Pedro Hill" and "Los Oeritos" stations were recovered witlwut difficulty, and the party was then transferred to Anaheim, from which point primary station ''San Juan," secondary station "Las Bolsas," and the terminal stations of the Los Angeles base line were visited, examined, and prepared for occupation. All the marks were found undisturbed, but the country in the vicinity has become thickly settled and much improved since the base line was measured in 1889, and the difficulties in executing a triangulation have therefore been considerably increased. Lines of eucalyptus trees have t>een planted along both sides of most of the roads, aud mauy of the houses are now surrounded by groves of the same trees. ''Northwest base" station itself stands in the midst of one of these groves, and the view was found completely obstructed in all directions. Consi1lerable cutting of lines was therefore necessary to secure the intervisibility of stations, and this had to be accomplished by simply sawing off the tops of trees, as the owners naturally objected to having them cnt down. By the end of August the lines were all cleared, and the observations began on the 1st of September at ''Las Bolsas" station. "Los Cerit-0s" and " San Pedro Hill" were next occupied, in the order named, and on their completion preparations were made for the work at the primary stations. The camp outfit was overhauled and packed, and the party set out for "San Juan," in charge of Recorder G. F. Wakefield, Assistant Dickins meanwhile visiting and recovering "Wilsons Peak" and posting a heliotroper there. Assistant Dickins rejoiued the party at" San Juan" on the 12tl1 of October, completed the occupation of that station on the 26th, and immediately transferred the party to "Wilsons Peak," where the final observations were made on the 16th of November. On the 20th, with a reduced party, he

returned to northwest, and rsoutheast bases for the purpose of tearing down the brick towers and scaffolds and setting up in their places suitable granite monuments. 'l'his work was somewhat delayed by the failure of the contractor to complete the monuments by the specified time, but was satisfactorily concluded by December 10, and the party then returned to San Francisco, arriving on the 13th. Assititant Dickins then reported to Assistant A. F. Hodgers, and was engaged on his computations and other office work until assigned to field duty in couucction with the resurvey of San Francisco Bay and Harbor.

Examination of tlte 8e(i approaches to the mouth of the Coquille River, Oregon.-Iu October, 18!)(l, Assistant A. I<'. H.odgers, iu accordance with telegraphic instructions, detailed l\Ir. l"erdinand ·w estllahl to determine the positions of reported rock breaks in the approaches to the mouth of Coquille River, Oregon. The bar was crossed 011 the 25th, and examinations of the breaks were accomplished the same day, but a heavy rolling sea prevented the taking of soundings. 'fhe determinations of the positions were made from shore stations, and the work was finally completed on the 31st, and l\Ir. "\Vestdahl then returned to San Francisco. The work was executed by means of. a boat and crew, kindly detailed by Superintendent 'l'. J. Blakeney from the life-saving station at Bandon. Continuation of the survey of Washington Sound, lYashinvton-triangulatfon a.nd topography.Early in May, 1897, Assistant J .·T. Gilbert, in accordance with instructions, left San Francisco and proceeded to Olympia and Seattle to prepare for the resumption of the survey of Washington Sound. After attenuing to the repairs of the steam launch· F1tcti, he organized, party and reached the field of operations, Sau .Juan Island, on the 24th. The triangulation was first ta.ken up, but before much progress had been made it was found necessary to detail him to make, for tho Navy Department, an immediate special examination of the approaches to the Port Orchard Naval Station. After laying out work to keep his party employed during his absence, he proceeded on J uue 17 to Port Orchard and was there engaged until the 26th. On the completion of the special duty, an account of which will be found under the head of "Special operations," he retumed to San Juan and resumed the interrupted triangulation. 'fhe work was still in progress at the close of the fiscal y~ar, but the following statistics to that date have been furnished:

The full statement of results of the season's work will be given in tho uex.t annual report. Geodetic 'trork in Utah-measurement of the &ill Lake base linc.-At the close of the last fiscal year the party of Assistant William Eimbeck was in the field engaged in the preparation of the Salt Lake base line and making tbe connection witb the transcontinental triangulation. Assistant Bimbeck was occupying- "V\7 addoup" station while the auxiliary party under the churge of Assistant P.A. \Velker was observing at ''Antelope" station, aud the preparation of the base line aud the erection of tl1e necessary piers were making good progress nuder Assistant J. J. Gilbert's direction. :' V\7 ad do up" and "Antelope" stations were completed by the 5tb of July; Assistant \.Y elker then proceeding to "Ogden Peak" and Assistant Eimbeck to "~outh Base." 'l'hese stayons were completed by the end of July, and the parties then occupied" Promontory" and ''North Base," respectively, completing the observatious there by the middle of August. At the north and south base stations scaffold signals 70 feet in height were required to render the points iutervisible, and one. of these structures was destroyed by a cyclone early iu august. The relmilding- of this signal caused some delay in the prosecution of the connecting triangulation, but the junction was satisfactorily concluded by the middle of the n~onth, as above stated. The elevation of the terminals of the base line above sea level was deduced from a carefully conducted series of zenith distances measured at all stations of the triangulation, and for further verification a double line of levels was run from" Nortlr Base" to" Hooper Bench," on the eastern shore of Great Salt Lake. 'l'he different sections of the party were then united for the measurement of

the base, the preparations for which Assistant Gilbert had nearly completed. The actual measurement began on the 3d of December, the app.aratus used being the duplex bars designed by Assistant Eimbeck and com;tructt>d at the oflice of the Survey. During the measure the bars were protected from the sun and weather by a movable canvas-covered shelter~ framed of light timber and so securely braced together as to be able to stand all strains and stresses to which it was necessarily su~jected. This shelter was 5fi feet in length, 12 feet wide, and !) feet high, and traveled on runners, two horses being required to draw it along the line. The base, 11·~ kilometres in length, was measured. in kilometre sections, each section being measured once in each direction, under rising and falling temperatures, and reference marks being also established at erwh half kilometre. After a short time snflicient training and experience were acquired by the members of the party to enable them to measure a kilometre per day without difficulty, and the most favorable l1ours were chosen, so as to secure as nearly as possible an equal division of the conditions of rising a11d falling temperatures. The first measure of the base was completed on the 17th of September, and the return measure was begun the following day. A delay of four days was caused by damage to the shelter sled and to one of the bars by a cyclone which struck the party's camp on the night of the 18th; fortunately the bars escaped serious injnry, but the shelter sled was wrecked and had to be reconstrncted. 'fhe second measure was completed on the :3d of October, and the bars were then carefully reexami11e<l and tested for important adjustments, after which they were securely packe<l and shipped to Washington. Camp was then broken, suitable arrangements made for the storag-e and care of the equipage, instruments, and live stock, ancl the party disbanded. The results of the base measure proved very satisfactory in all respects, and the behavior of the new base apparatus was excellent. Assistant. Eimbeck reports that a relative accuracy of 1-:3 000 000 was easily attained, both by the duplex and by the thermometric principle, and t.hat the speed of the measure was as great as ever previously attained with other forms of base apparatus. Assistant Eimbeck was aided in the base measure by Assistants J .·T. Gilbert, P.A. \-Velker, H.P. Hitter, and C. C. Yates, Recorder Buford Lynch, and Foreman C. S. Wilkes, aud in his report highly compliments all of these gentlemen for their efficient arnl enthusiastic support. On the completion of the field work Assistants Gilbert and Ritter· were assigned to duty at the San Francisco suboffice, and Assistants Eimbeck, Welker, and Yates returned to Washington, where they were engaged on the computations and other ofiice work-Mr. Eimbeck to the close of the fiscal year, and the others until assig'necl to further tiel<l <lnt.y. A redetermination of the length and constants of the duplex bars was also made as soon as the apparatus was received from the field, this being rernlered necessary by the accident to bar No. 15 and al8o by the apparent wear of the agate knife edges. Assistant Eimbeck ha~ prepared for publication a detailed description of the apparatus, and an account of the measurement of the Salt Lake base; he bas also submitted, under date of .January 7, 18!>7, a design for a new second pendulum of the compound type, its form being that of a disk, and his report sets forth the numerous advantages possessed by this instrument over the various forms heretofore used for gravity determinations. Reconnaissance and triangulation in tlte States of Utah, Nevada, and Ida.lw.-Early in June, i8!>7, Assistant P.A. ·welker, in accordance with instructions, proceeded to Salt Lake City, Utah, for the purpose of executing a reconnaissance and primary triangulation in the States of Uta;i, Nevada, and Idaho. This triangulation starts from the line "Ogden" - "Pilot Peak" of the transcontinental system, and will ultimately be extended through the State of Montana to the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude. .Assistant Welker reached Salt Lake City on the 18th of June, and was there joined on the 23d by Aid "\V. O. Denson, who had been assigned to his party. The instruments and outfit heretofore used on the transcontinental work, and stored at Salt Lake City and Kaysville, wt>re taken charge of and thoroughly overhauled, and by the close of the fiscal year all preparations for the beginning of active field operations were completed. The results of the work will be given in my next annual report. Magnetic observations in the State of Jlfontana.-In July, J8!)(i, Assistant R. L. Faris, engaged in the determination of the magnetic declination, dip, and int~nsity, and the necessary astronomical factors, at various points in the Central and Northwestern 8tates, as mentioned under the head of Middle ])iyision, occupied f'ltations at Havre and Glasgow, in the State of :i\Iont.ana. Nine additional points in the 8tate determined before ,July 1 are given in my last annual report.

The localities of field operations in Alaska are· shown on Progress Sketches at the close of Part I. .lfydrographie and general suri·eys in southeast Alaska.-Tbe steamer P<itterson, under the command of Lieut. Cpmmander E. K. :Moore, U.S. N., on the completion of the repairs which were in progress at the close of the last fiscal year, was fitted out for the continuation of the Alaska surveys, and sailed from Seattle, \-Vash., on the 14th of July, 189u. The Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey accompaniecl the party for the purpose of examining the g·eneral features of the country in the vicinity of the boundary line between southeast Alaska and British Columbia, and, therefore, the various inlets between Port Simpson and Yakutat Bay were visited before the Patterson proceeded to her fielcl of operations. The regular work of .the party began on the 8th of August in Peril Strait, at the point reached by the triangulation of 1895, the Superintendent remaining with the party until August 23 for the purpose of inspecting the methods of cal'rying on the survey. The general locality of the season's work embraced Peril Strait, Salisbury Sound, and Neva and Alga straits, and the work included triangulation, hydrography, and topography, with the incidental tidal and current observations. The different branches of the work were carried on simultaneously, each officer of the party having special duty assigned him, and the survey in any locality was complete before the vessel was movecl to a new anchorage. The triangulation began at Fish and Suloi points, and wns carried through the south branch of Peril Strait, across Salisbury Sound, through Neva Strait, across Nakwasina Passage and tbroug!1 Olga, Strait to Lisianski and Siginaka islancls; also through Safo1bury Sound to the sea. A sextant triangulation was also carried through Krestof Sound to its junction with Sitka Sound and into Nakwasina Passage. The shore line and hydrography executed cover the same limits, but the topography was delayed. by various causes and was not completed below Salisbury Sound. The channels surveyed this year are for the most part narrow and intricate, and considerable ditlicnlty was at times experienced in locating points for the triangulation, the cliffs rising abruptly from the water's edge and the summits being densely wooded. l'he season's work closed on the 6th of October, and on the 9th the party sailed for Sau Francisco, stopping en route at W'hitewater Bay, \Vraugcll Strait, aucl Clover Passage to investigate reported rocks and shoals, an1l at Departure 13ay foL' coal and. water; San Francisco was reached on the 23d.

'rlle naval officers attaclled to the l'<tltcrson were as follows: Lieut. Uommaud.er E. K. }Joore (in commaml), Lieut. ,J. .l. Kuapp, Lieut. R l<'. Lopez, J,ieut. -w. B. Hoggatt, Ensign W. \V. Gilmer, Ensigu G. n. Bradshaw, and P.A. Surg. I{, M. Kennedy. Yeomen H. L. Ford and Hugh l{,odman and l\laster-at-Arms W. S. Allen served as recorders and draftsmen. Resumption of hydrographic an<l general surveys in southeast Alaska in the spring of 1897.-'l'ltc steamer I'a.tter.~on, under the command of Lieut. Oornmander E. K. Moore, was again fitted out for the Alaskan work in tlle spring of 1897, and sailed from S:i.n ll'rancisco on the 4tll of April. En route to the field of operations the tidal stations at Victoria and Esquimalt were visited and new stations were established in Seymour Narrows and Sergius Narrows. Sitka was reached on the 30th, aud here the tidal station 011 .Taponski Island was again set in operation, thm; .forming a chain of tidal stations from Victoria to Sitka. The survey was begun on the nortll sid.e of Sitka Sound, where the previous season's work en<led, and was continued d.own the sound to a connection with tlle work of 1893, thus completing tlle inside steamer route from Dixons Entrance to Sitka, via. Juneau and the head of Lynn Canal, with all the arms, bays, passages, and bights connected therewith. A verification tapeline base 52;"; metres in length was measured at the mouth of ln<lian 1-tiver, near Sitka, and connected with the triangulation of 18H3. 'rhe work at the mouth of Salisbury Sound was next taken up and carried about 15 miles to the northward and westward off the coast of Chickagoff Island, and progress was also made to the southward on the sea side of Kruzoff Island. The completion of the survey of both inside and olltside connections of Sitka Sound with Salisbury Sound during this season seems to be well assured, the above representing the progress made to the close of the fiscal year. The outside sonn<lings :ire being carried to the 100-fathom curve, and it is found that the depths increase more gradually outside than inside, except off the mouth of Sitka Sound, about 8 miles off Cape Edgecumbe, where a deep hole exists, the depths dropping from 70 to 500 fathoms in 2 miles. Oft' Salisbury Sound and to the northward and westward the 100-fathom curve is from 12 to 15 miles offshore and the coast is very treacherous, many outlying sunken rocks and reefa being found as far out as 2 miles from shore. The shores, both iuside and outside, are rugged and precipitous. About 10 miles to the northward and westward of Salisbury Sound tl1ere is an extensive archipelago, extending nearly to the mouth of Cross Sound, and afforijiug an inside channel for small vessels.

duty under his direction, joi11ing· him at a specified point on Puget Sound in time to connect with the steamer starting for Alaska early in April. The plan of the season's work may be here recapitulated: Assistant .l\iorso to occupy the astronomical station at Sitka, make the necessary time observations there, and rate his chronometers, while new stations at Kadiak Island and Unalaska were similarly occupied by Assistant 11. P. H.itter and Aid 0. B. French, respectively; Assistant F. A. Young to take charge of the chronometers to be carried on three or more successive round trips of the Alaska Commercial Company's steamer. Dor(I,, and to intercompare them daily; the carried chronometers, twenty-one in numller, to be carefully compared with those of each of the three astronomical stations on each arrival and departure of the steamer, both by Assistant Young and the astronomer of the station; the latitude of the Kadiak and Unalaska stations to be carefully determined by a sufficient number of astronomical observations, and the magnetic elements, declination, dip, and intensity to be determined at all three stations; also topographical surveys of the harbors and adjacent country to be made as opportunity offered witlwut interferiug with the main work of the expedition; all parts of the work to be under the general direction and supervision of Assistant Morse. Assistant :\Jorse left San Francisco by steamer on March 25, was joined by the other members of tile party on reachiug Port Townsend, took passage on the steamer Cit]! of 1'opcka at Seattle A1n·il 2, and reached Sitka on the 8th. Here, in accordance with the programme outlined, Mr. l\lorse lauded with his instruments and the other observers transferred their outfits to the steamer Dom. On account of unfavorable weather, time observations at Sitka were uot obtained prior to the departure of the Dora on the 9th, but all the chronometers, thirty-two in number, were · carefully intercompared. Jlessrs. mtter and French reached their allotted stations on the 14th and 19th of April respectively and immediate preparations were made for the beginning of the observations, but at both stations bad weather prevented the secnring of time.determiuations before the departure of the steamer. First observations were secured at Sitka on the 11th and at Kadiak and Unalaska on the 21st. The third round trip was ~ompleted in July, but owing to the partial failure of the first half of the first a fourth round trip was deemed necessary, and that was completed by August l. The last half of the fourth trip was also defective owing to bad weather at Kadiak, the last observations there being eight days before the arrival and departure of the steamer, so that out of the four trips only three good determinations were ol>tained. At Sitka Assistant Morse obtained time observations on forty-two nights, and during July three days were devoted to magnetic observations~ declination, dip, and intensity. At Kadiak much cloudy and rainy weather was experienced, but Assistant Hitter observed time on twentysix nights and latitude on nine nights, and made magnetic determinations 011 three days; he also tl'igonometrically connected his astronomical station with that of 1867, the position of the latter being approximately recovered, but not being conveniently situatt>d for tlie longitude work, as it was too far distant from the steamer lan1ling. At U11alaslrn the weather conditions were unfavorable also, but the requisite tlumber of time and latitude observations were obtained. 'l'he magnetic elements were also determined on three days and a base line 1 ·77 kilometres in length was measured. From this base a small scheme of triangulation was ca_rried to the head of Captains llay, and a topographical survey, comprising- an area. of :w square miles, and including the town and harbor of U11alaska and Dutch Harbor, wits executed. 'Vhile en route to Sitka, at the close of the work, l\lr. French took advantage of the stopirn,ge of tlrn steamer at Unga to make sextant observations there for latitude a11d time. Me1:1srs. Hitter, French, and Young, on the completion of the fourth round trip of the Dora, reported to Assistant Morse at Sitka on the 1st of August, and the entire party on the 7th took passage on the Cit!/ of Topeka for Png-et Sound. On arriving at Port 'l'ownsend .Assistants You11g and Hitter were detached from the party, the former in acco1·dance with instructions proceeding to Washington, D. C., and the latter to Utah for the purpose of joining the party of Assistant Eimbeck. Messrs. Morse and French then proceeded to San Francis1"0 and thern completed the records and computations of the season's work.

Duffield was directed to organize a party at Seattle or San Francisco for the survey of the Pribilof Islands, Bering Sea, Alaska, and Assistants Fremont Morse, G. H,, Putnam, and G. L. Flower were directed to report to him to assist in the work. Seattle was reached on the 30th of April and the party was organized by May 3. The revenue cutter Bear furnished transportation, landing the party at Unalaska on May lfl for astronomical observations, ancl finally at St. Paul Island of the Pribilof group on l\lay 25. The remainder of tile fiscal year was spent in base measurement and triangulation and preparations for the topographical work. Five short -subsidiary bases for the seal rookery surveys were measured, their lengths varying from 400 to GUO metres aud 180 points were marked for future reference. A base 44'..l2 metres in length was also measured for the principal triangulation, twenty-one signals were erected aml thirteen stations were occupied, thus completing the triangulation of St. Paul Island. 'fhe uecessary astronomical observations for time, latitude, aud azimuth were also made when weather permitted. The party being- still in the field, the further account of its operations is deterred aml will appear in the next annual report.

Putnam was authorized by the Honorable Secretary of the Treasury to accompany the exploring expedition about to start for Greenland under charge of Prof. A. K Burton, and on July 2 left Washington for the purpose of looking after the instruments, which had to he placed on a steamer at Boston on .July 4 and to be again tram;ferrcd at llalifax and Sydney. '.Vhile at Halifax, Assistant Putnam made magnetic observations at the same station, in Her l\Iajesty's dockyard, occupied by Assistant J. B. Baylor in 187!), and on July 11, 12, and 1:3, while waiting the arrival of the steamer Hope, which was to carry the expedition northward, magnetic and pendulum observations were made at S~·dney, Cape Breton. The llope sailed from ::5yduey on the 16th, bearing Lieut. H. E. Peary and party, Prof. A. K Burton and party, and others. On the 20th, a few hours' stop was made at Turuavic, Labrador, and Assistant Putnam availed himself of the opportunity to secure magnetic observations. After considerable delay from ice on the Labrador Ooast, the vessel entered Hudson Strait, and the piuties lauded at Ashe Inlet, where magnetic and gravity observations were obtained 011 the 25th and 26th. After being prevented by ice from entering Cumberland Sound, thQ llopc steamed across Davis Strait to the Greenland Coast, making a first stop at Godhavn~ the capital of North Greenland, and here magnetic determinations were made on the 3d of August. On August 5 the Burton party was landed at Umanak an<l the Hope proceeded farther north. At Umanak Af'sistant Putnam made pendulum obserYations from the 8th to the 12th and magnetic observations on the 14th, 15th, and 18th. The remainder of the month was spent in making computations, duplicating records, etc., and opportunity was found to forward a set of the records by means of it Danish vessel ~ailing for Copenhagen. Early in September Mr. Pntuam accompanied Professor llnrton's party 011 an expedition to the Itiodliarsut glacier, and assisted in the glacial investigations that were rna<le. The party returned to Umauak 011 the 8th and the following day the llopc returned and took them on board. On the 11th Godhavn was again touclled at and the magnetic observations were repeated. After encountering a i-;eyere storm in crossing Davis Strait and being delayed three days in the ice off Cape )forcy, the Hope entered Cumberland Sound arnl lande1l the party at Niantilik, where magnetic and pendulum observations were obtained on the 17th and 18th. After steaming sonth along the I~abra<lor Coast, Sydney was reached on the 26th, and additional magnetic observations were made the same day. Assistant Putnam then returned to Washi11gton and reported for fnrther duty. The results of the voyage, so far as the work of this Survey is concerned, may bo summarized as follows: :Magnetic observations were made at sev<>n stations, at two of them both going a111l coming; at a number of these points the results will be of interest in sturlying the secular variation of the magnetic elements, as they have been previously occupied by earlier explorers, and in several cases the exact point of observations was recover<>d aud used. Two of the stations in Omuberland Sound all(l. Hudson Strait arc comparativdy near the magnetic pole, the 1lip being abo.ut 84° and the horizontal force so weak that chan~<>s pf several degrees in the direction of the horizontal needle took place in a few hours. Pendulum observations for the determination of the force of gravity "·er<i made at four stations, at two of which, however, they were not complete because unfavorable weather and the short stay of the ship prevented the obtaining of satisfactory observations. At the most 11 orthcrly station, Umanak, the observations were fortunately quite complete. This point is in latitude 70° 41' north, well therefore within the Arctic Circle and nearly as far north as Point Barrow in Alaska.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SUH.VEY.

In the chart of pendulum titations recently pu!Jlished !Jy Professor Helmert, in tlie Report of the International Geodetic Association for 1896, there appear no observations for this region, and those obtained by Assistant Putnam will therefore be of special interest to the scientific world. Mr. Putnam in his report expresses his appreciation of the courtesy shown him !Jy Lieut. H. E. Peary, Prof. A. E. Burton, and the various members of the party, and the valuable assistance rendered him from time to time. He also specially refers to the courtesy of l\fr. Hjalmur Kunhtsen, governor of the Danish Colony of Umanak, who placed a house at his disposal, in which the pendulum o!Jservatious were made, and did ernrythiug in his power to make the stay of the party pleasant. For facilitating the work, thanks are also due to Capt. John Bartlett, of the Hope; Mr. Andersen, inspector of North Greenland, Mr. A. Vizard, storekeeper of Her .Majesty's dockyard, Halifax, and Mr. J. P. Fairbanks, proprietor of the Sydney Hotel, Sydney, Cape Breton. Assistant Putnam has prepared for publication two reports, on the magnetic and gravity observations, respectively, including in the latter all pendulum o!Jservations made by him during 1895.and 18!J6, and these papers will appear as appendices to this report. 1\Ir. Putnam before again taking the field also performed miscellaneous office duties, among which may be mentioned the determination of the corrections of three standard salinometres and the densities of a large num!Jer of sea-water specimemi stored in the archives of the Survey. His further field services have already been noticed under the head of Alaska Division. Latitude determinations at Dova, Del., and Round Hill and Lcesbw·g, Ya., with a view to the selection of stat-ions for the .Internatfonal Lat-itude Servicc.-'I'he International Geodetic Association, having in view the continuous and simultaneous observation of variation of latitude at a immber of stations, has at various tiwes during the year corresponded with this ofl:ice on tlle subject and requested our cooperation in the matter of the selection of suita!Jle sites for the observatories.. The following translation of an extract from a communication signed by Prof. F. H. Heh.qert states the case concisely, aud enumerates tbe points to be considered in making· the selection of the two North American stations:
"There arc two projects for th.is which wore proposed lJy :\fossrs. Foerster and Yan do Sande-Bakhnyzon. 1\1. Foerster proposes four stations on the same parallel, while M. llakhuysen think.i that greater advantage will come from the stations being placed in tlrn dcinity of established observatories, nrnl ho believes that with the same sum of money seven or eight stntions can thus he arranged for. (Compare th(1 proceedings of Lausanne, pp. 9!l to 100.) Tho Central Bureau desires to carry out Foorstor's project, for reasons which wore given liy mo ii~ tho Lausanne proceedings, 1n·ovidecl that it is possible to find four stations suitable in all respects for tho work, and nt which tho observers would lie able to live comfortably. Tho Iatitu(le 3(F' 8' is fixed upon, on which, liesidcs the stations Cagliari and lllidsusawa, two Xorth American i;tations will lio chosen. For the latter, Dover in the east and Ukiah in tlie west h:we been thought of, in which placP8 favoraule meteorological and seismological conditions exist. In place of Uo\·er another station which would be more accei;sible to Washington could he very well stilistit.ut.cd; for i11sta11co, Hound Hill, Va. One ~niglit ali;o think of the oliservatory of Cincinnati, but tho mathematical concl~tiorn1 in this 11lacc arc less favorable than in Doyer. In 11lace of Ukiah a station in the Sacramouto Valley might be taken, whl1re the meteorological conditions are also very favorable. It is now dcsire(l that :i local inYcst.igation be macle at the places name1l as i;oon as possible, where, naturally, tho latitmle to the nearest ton seconds must liti measured in order that one may not depart too far from the parallel 39° 8'. Besides favorable meteorological conditions, tho statio:J must lie so situated that e(rual conditions of atmospheric refraction exist to tho north anll south, arnl for the same reasons it is desirable that profiles of the surface, M 1vcll as tho Yegctation, shoul1l lie nearly the same to the north and south, am.I. also that changes of those conclitions are not probahle in the future. It is also to lie taken into consideration whether the situation o"f the observatory can lie rotained for, say, one hundred years, and also whether now constructions are to lie expected. A change in the locality would lie very difficult, as it coulU !wt be made without a Jong correspoudipg series of oli8ervations on lioth the old aud now stations, all of which would entail great expense. It is thcroforo necessary that th~ site sh .. uld be purchased by t.110 United States Go\·ernment, or in somo other way its permanence ai;sured. The topography arouud tho station both far and near should bo, if possilile, made evident by. sketches or charts, hy meanb of which, also, the relation of the height!! Bhoulcl bo indicated. Although according to what has just boeu said it appears desirable that the stations should not be. too near an inhabited locality yet ·ou the other hand, it is desirable that houses should ho near where the oliserver could subsist. Jn gene~;! it :nay lie said that the reply in regard to the question of subsistence of the observer in tho chosen station it1 of the grcatet1t importanco. In regard to tho local invcstigatiouR to be carried out, I havo to remark that tho expenses thereby incurrod would be borne by tho International Geodetic Association, but at the present time no money of any groaL amount is av:i.ilahle, so that it will he necessary to make the expenses as i;mall us possible. "It. appears to me that a reconu:iiHsauce for the Western stations presents some ditllculties as to traveling expenses from WaHhington, which would be very heavy; lint if tho Coast 8nrvey has not an officm· in the neighbor0

hood engaged on other work, possibly the greater p:irt of the expense could be saved by sending someone from San Francisco or from the Lick Observatory. I take it that the arrangement of the expenses 11thir will present no serious difficulties."

In accordance with tlie preceding request, Assistant C. H. Sinclair was directed to make latitude determinations at each of the three Bastern stations named, and in case of the results differing more than half a minute froni the desired value to make an examination of the country in the required direction to ascertain its availability for a station, special attention being paid to the requirements enumerated by Professor Helmert. At Dover the observations were made in May in connection ~vith, or ratl;er incident to, the longitude determination already mentioned in the proper geographical sequence. The latitude of the Dover Courthouse was found to be 39'.:> 09' 14", or slightly north of the prescribed limit of 39° 08' ::!: ~',and therefore the country to the south was examined. Mr. Sinclair reports that a suitable location can be found in the required latitude, and has indicated its position on a sketch accompanying his report. The observations at Round Hill and l1eesburg were made in June. At .Ronnd Hill Mr. Sinclair occupied a })oint in a pasture field a short distance northwest of the railroad depot, and found its latitude to be 39° 08' 15". The town of Round Hill lies entirely to the south of this point, stretching along the road for a distance of half a mile. The country is heavily rolling, but the topography is quite uniform in character. Fine growths of locust, oak, chestnut, hickory, aud other deciduous trees exist, but the larger part of tlte country has been cleared for cultivation. About 3 miles to the westward are the heights of the Blue Ridge, but Hound Hill itself has an elevation of 600 feet above sea level. The same character of country is. found at Purcellville to the westward, and at Hamilton, 6 miles t-0 the eastward, both points having nearly the same latitude as Round Hill. At J.,eesbnrg l\Ir. Sinclair's station was located in the grounds of the Leesburg Academy, but its latitude was fouud to be only 31)0 07' 07", or about half a mile too far south. It was found, however, tltat a suitable site in the required latitude was obtainable. Leesburg lies 2 miles east of the Oa,toctin l\Iountains and 12 miles east of Round Hill, an<l has an elevation of 400 feet above sea level. Assist.ant Sinclair reports that the mail facilities and conveniences for living are superior at this station to any of the others examined, and that the climatic and otllcr conditions are about equal. Sketches of the localities examined, showing the proposed sites for the observatories, accompany ·Mr. Sinclnir's report. The magnetic observations made at Dover, Round Hill, and Leesburg 11ave already been mentioned under the proper geographical headings. On the completion of the observations and examinations Assistant Sinclair returned to Washington and was engaged on his computations during the few days remaining of the fiscal year. .LayinlJ out of a .~peed-trial course for nm:al ves8els in Chesapea.ke Bay.-In compliance with the request of the Navy Department for the laying out and marking of a speed-trial course, 24~ nautical miles in length, in Chesapeake Bay, for the speed trials of torpedo boats 3, 4, and 5, Lieut. Commander A. Dunlap, U.S. N., commanding the steamer Bla.ke, was directed to prepare that vessel for the work, and Lieut. E. H. 'rillman, U. S. X., with the schooner Matchless, was directed to report to him and render such assistance as might be required. .Assist.ant D. B. Wainwright, with his aid, R. B. Derickson, wa'S also instructed to execute the necessary trian· gulation, the scheme being so arranged as to be available for and form part of the regular triangulation of the Chesapeake Bay resurvey. The Blak1J left Baltimore on the 17th of March, Messrs. Wainwright and Derickson having joined the vessel the previous evening, and reached the locality of the course the next day. Lieutenant 'l'illman, with the 1lfatchh·.~.~, reported on the 22<1, having been detained by fogs and head winds. The site selected for the trial course may be briefly described as follows: It lies nearly paralJel to and somewhat to the eastward of the axis of the bay; its north end is opposite Parkers Creek, a~d its south end is opposite Point no Point, or about 7 miles above the mouth of the Potomac niver.. A search was first made for old trigonometrical stations, but t.hese, wit.h two exceptions, had ~sapp~ared, and it was necessary to execute a new triangulation over a section of the bay 3a miles in length, the average width being 10 miles. Bleven signals were built, and 7 of these, together with 4 lighthouses, were occupied with a theodolite for the measurement of the horizontal angles. The angular measurements were begun on the 27th and continued without . ' interrnptron, save from bad weather, until April 15. The computations were made as rapidly as

4G

possible, and the line was then placed on the projection furnished for the purpose, the length of tlle course, as already stated, being about 24~ nautical miles. .Meanwhile Lieutcuant Tillman had eRtablished an excellent range for the southern end of the course, and it was deemed advisable to establish a similar one at the northern end. 'l'lte east side of the bay was fou11d impracticable for this purpose and the west side seemed scarcely less so, but Assistant vYaiuwrigl!t, after running a transit line back 2 miles, found that a good range could be obtained by cutting a vista through the trees or by building a high signal (80 to 100 feet). The time and expense necessary to accomplish this, however, caused the abandonment of the pr~ject, but the points were marked so that the range can be established at any qnie in the future. if deemed essential. Small watch buoys were then placed to mark the positions for the larger buoys to be furni"shcd by the Light-House Establishment, and on the 21st the lighthouse steamer 1llaple arrived with the larger buoys, which were all placed in position the same day, their positions being det-0rmined by simultaneous observations with two theodolites stationed on shore. On checking the vositions next day all were found accurate excepting that of the lmoy marking the south end of the course, which had to be shifted somewhat. 'fhe buoys at the end of the course are first·class can buoys and are anchored with sinkers weighing from :~ 000 to 3 200 pounds, and the five intermediate ones are second-class can buoys with sinkers of from 1 500 to 1 800 pounds. Beginning on the range at the southern end at a point 4·9 miles B fl N from Point no Point trigonometrical station, the course runs N by \Y 1 W to the northern t.erminal, which is 4·() miles from Parkers trigonometrical station and 3·3;) rnile8 west by uorth from .James Point Station. The field work was completed on the 23d of April, and the Blake and Matchless returned to Sparrow Point and Baltimore, respectively, the latter resuming her regular tidal work in that locality. Assistant \Yainwright and Aid Derickson left the Blake on her arrival and proceeded to Washington, where they were engaged on office work to the close of the fiscal year. 'l'he reports of Lieut. Commander A. Dunlap and Assistant D. B. \Vainwright coutain much interesting information concerning the changes that l1ave have occurred in the hydrography and topogTaphy of this portion of Chesapeake Bay since the date of the old survey, and Mr. Wainwright has also submitted a scheme for the continuation of the triangulation northward to a junction with that already executed above Kent Island."

Examination of a portion of the boundary line between Spartanburg anil Greenville counties, S. C.-The north aud south boundary line between the counties of Spartanburg and Greenville has been for some time in dispute, and various resurveys of it from time to time failing to agree, the board of commissioners of Spartanburg finally requested a local firm of civil engineers to make a true, accurate, and scientific survey of said line and determine its true aud correct location. '.rhe report of these engineers, when received, did not meet the views of all members of the board and· a re.solution was then passed requesting tlJe l\Iember of Congrnss of the dh;trict to obtain from the Coast and Geodetic Survey the detail of one of its otlicers to examine and report upon the quality and accuracy of the work executed, due provision being at the same time made for defraying the expenses incident to the examination. In compliance with the terms of the resolution, submitted by Hon. Stauyarue vVilson, Assistant W. C. Hodgkius was instructed to proceed to Spartanburg to confer with the board of commissioners and make such examinations as might be found necessary. Mr. Hodgkins left Washington on the 11th of November, and was engaged 011 this duty ·until December 14. During this time he made a careful study of the historical features of the case, carefully weighed all the evidence submitted, and examined into the methods used in the various resurveys of the line. He also made magnetic observations at various points of the line, and found considerable local dettections, and these to a large extent account for the t!"onble in reestablishing the original boundary, which was of course laid out with a compass, and consequently followed a zigzag course.

The work of the local engineers was fouud to be of excellent quality, bnt they had proceeded on the assumption that the line should be a straight one from the uorthern terminus to the southern one, a point uot conceded by all parties, and so laid it out, but the 1>traight line, as was to be expected, failed to coin'cide with the original boundary at intermediate points; the location of the soutlier11 terminus, moreover, was also a point of co11troversy, there ueing no monument to mark the spot and some ambiguity in tlie descl'iption, but it seems to be fairly well established that the adopted position is not seriously iu error. Assistant Hodgkins made an exhaustive re1lort on the whole subject after his returu to \Vashingtou, and copies were at once famished to the board of commissioners and to Messrs. Ladshaw & Ladshaw, the engfoeers who executed the resurvey of the line. :M:r. Ilodgkins's further services will be noticed under the proper geographical .headings elsewhere in this report. Rcsun~ey of Bnms1cick Bar, Georgia.-'l'he river and harbor act of August 17, 1894, und~r item "For improving the outer bar of Brunswick, Georgia," anthorized the )layment to Mr. C. P. Goodyear of certain sums of' mouey for the procurement at Hpecilled dates of channels of specified width and depth, the method of improvement being uy the explosion of dynamite on the bottom. The river and harbor act of .Tune 3, 1896, amended some of the provisions of the- former act, and further provided that the resurvey to determine the re1>ult of Mr. Goodyear's work should be made by an experienced officer of tho Coast and Geodetic Survey, under the direction and su1lervision of the Honorable the Secretary of \Var. l\Ir. Goodyear in November reported that he had procured the necessa~y width and depth of channel, thus complying with the requirements of the acts above referred to, and requested an immediate survey. Lieut. Robert G. Peck, U. S. N., commanding the steamer Ba.clie, was selected as the oflicer to represent the Ooast and Geodetic Survey, and was directed to report to the ~onorable Secretary of \Var for instructious. 'fhe repairs which the Bache was undergoing at New York were hastened as much as possible, bnt it was not until December 19 that the vessel was ready for sea. ·s:iiliug on that date, Lieutenant Peck reached St. Simon Sonn<l on the 27th, but it was not until J auuary 4 that the weather permitted tho beginning of operations. 'l'he survey was finished April rn, aft<ir au exceptionally stormy and unfavorable season, which prolonged the work mnch beyond the time auticipat<id for its completion. Owing to the minute requirements as to widths and depths, the latter being determined to tenths of feet, more elaborate aud precise methods of executing the survey were necessary than are customary in ordinary hydrographic work, and special care bad to be taken to establish accurately the plane of reference (mean high water) to which the soundings were to be reduced. By a special device the tide-gauge readings were recorded to hundredths of feet and at intervals of five minutes. The positions of soundings wer~ determined by sextant and theodolite angles taken from observing stations previously established op the bar. The sounding lines were run on ranges and at intervals of 25 feet, one system of lines parallel to the direction of the channel being croRsed at rigl.Jt angles by another system similarly spaced. Tho scale chosen for the hydrographic sheet was necessarily a large one (1-1 250), to l)Crmit of the plotting· of the large number of soundings and the accurate delineation of the contour lines. Nearly 30 000 soundings, out of about 39 000 taken during the survey, are shown on the sheet. On the completion of the work the Bache left Brunswick for N cw York, arriving at the latter point on the 27th of April. 'l'he office work was then prosecuted as rapidly as possible, and was completed before the close of the fiscal year. The hydrographic sheet and the original records of the survey have been forwarded to the Honorable the Secretary of War, and copies have been deposited in the archiyes of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. 'l'he results of the resurvey and their bearing on l\lr. Goodyear's claims are matters with which this office has uo conceru, belonging pro1~erly to the report of the llouorable Secretary of War.

Sullivan, Chief Machinist A. J. Miskimon, Apothecary J.E. Shepherd, :111<1 Yeoman J. L. Dunn. Master at Arms Thomas S. Martin and Seamen John Craig and Andreas Andersen served as recorders. llydrographic survey to determine tlte i'a.luc of improvemmls at :Jw mouth of the Brazos River, Texa.~.-The river and harbor act of June 3, 1896, contained a provision for the appointment of a board of engineers, composed of a civil engineer, appointed by the President, an officer of the Corps of Engiueers, U.S. A., to be selected by the Secretary of' \>Var, and an officer of the Const and Geodetic Survey, to be selected by the Snperinteudent, to make an examination for the purpose of ascertaining the character and value of the improvements made at the month of Brazos IUver, Texas, by the Brazos Hiver Channel and Dock Company. These improvements were undertaken with a view to removing the bar at the mouth of the river and deepening the channel from the month to Velasco. The members selected to comprise the board were the following: Col. H. l\I. Hobert, U. S. E.; Hobert Moore, C. E., of St. Louis, and Assistant Stellman Forney, l7nited States Coast and Geodetic Survey. The board met in Washington, D. C., on December 11, 12, and 14, 1896, in Velasco, Tex., January 10 to 15, 1897, and again in \Vashington, D. C., to complete its report, February 15 to 18, 18!J7. 'l'he first requisite for the performance of the duties assigned to the board being a thorough survey to sb')w existing conditions, a full hydrographic party, under the charge of Assistant H. I1. Ma;rindin, was detailed by the Superintendent and placed under the board's direction. Assistant l\fariu<lin reported to Col. H. M. Robert, the president of the board, in accordance with instructions, aufl at once proceeded to Yelasco, 'fex., accompanied by Assistant A. L. Baldwin, Aid 0. 0. Yates, and Oscar l\L Strauller, an expert leadsman of the Coast Survey steamer Blake, and arrived at Velasco on the 25th of December. After visiting Galveston, for the purpose of collecting data in regard to previous surrnys, and securing descriptions of bench marks, etc., .Assista.nt l\iarindin :rnjoined the party at Quintana on the 28th, and completed the preparations for the hy<lrogra.phic survey, which was begun on the 4th of .January. A small naphtha launch was chartered. for the work, and from it all the soundings in the gulf and river were taken. The survey included the topography of the mouth and of the river as far up as Velasco, and the hydrography over the same limits and au area extending outward into the gulf about 2 miles, or about a mile beyond the sea end of the jetties. Observations of tides and currents were also made, and lines of levels. were run to connect the tide gauges with the various bench marks; a trigonometrical connection was also successfully made :with the old triangulation of J 852, the latter work, however, not without vexatious delays in the recovery of old stations. The old poii1ts recovered were "Brazos" and "Oyster Creek," the former in the city of Velasco. and the latter about 6 miles to the eastward; none of the stations on the intermediate shore of the gulf could be recovered, having long since been obliterated by the encroaehment of the sea or other causes. From the line "Brazos"-''0yster Creek" as a base, all the stations of 1894 and 1897 at the mouth of the river, including Brazos River lighthouse and several minor lights on the jetties, were determined. . In locating the soundings taken outside, two observers with instruments were stationed on shore at suitable points, and as a precautionary measure a third angle was measured on board the launch; for the river soundings, angles on distant signals were measured from the roof of the launch, the shores being low and the l'and flat, aud the waters of the river being at flood l.teight. A planetable survey of the shore line and jetty lines was found to be indispensable, as it appeared that a shift in position of the stream equal to about half its width had taken place since the previous survey, or that the positions of the shore line as furnished by the improvement company in 1894 were erroneous. . Five tide staffs were set up at various points~ which, t-Ogether with the self-registeriug gauge at 'the land end of the west jetty, made six points of tidal observation. 'l'he board did not deem an extensive series of current observations necessary, and corn;equent1y only a few current stations were occupied. The weather during a considerable portion of the season was unfavorable for field work, and on the 24th of January a severe" norther" set in, which lasted until the 29th, the temperature ranging from 10° to 20° below freezing point; the land was covered with a sheet of ice,

so that cattle were without food and many perished. The survey was completed, however, on the 27th, the party was disbanded on the 29th, and .Assistant Marindin and the officers of the party then returned to Washington. A complete map showing the results of the survey was prepared and furnished to the board, the original field sheets being deposited in the archives of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. All the expenses incident to the Brazos River work, excepting the salaries of the officers engaged, were paid by the board from the appropriation made by Congress for the purpose. The report of the board was presented to Congress on the 19th of February, 1897, and has been published as "Senate Document No. 138, Fifty.fourth Congress, second session," and Assistant l\farindin's report to the board is published in full therein as .Appendix 0. It would not be proper here to enter into 'a discussion of ·the results of the survey in their bearing upon the work executed by the Brazos l{iver Channel and Dock Company, that being the function of the board and a matter coming under the jurisdiction of the Honorable Secretary of War, and the reader is therefore referrecl to the document above mentioned for information on that subject.

Resurvey of the boundary line between the United States and Mexico.-At the close of the last fiscal year Assistant A. T. Mosman, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey member of the International Boundary Commission, was still on duty in Washington, completi:µg the office work incident to the recent survey of the boundary line between the United States and l\iexico. From .July 1 to September :30 of the present fiscal year he was engaged in directing the drawing aud engraving of the maps and profiles relating to said boundary lii1e and in assisting in the preparation of the final report of the commission. 'fhe work was completed at the date last mentioned, aud Assistant Mosman was then directed by the Honorable Secretary of State to report to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for his regular duty. He was then engaged on important offi~e work, mainly computations, until April 7, 1897, when he was assigned to field <luty on the primary triangulation of Vermont aud New York and its extension into Canada at Montreal. The account of this work will be found in its proper geographical sequence- elsewhere in this report. Laying out of a speed trial cour.~e in San Francisco Bay.-In l\'Iay, 1897, in accordance with the r~quest of the Navy Department, the party of the steamer Gedney under the command of I1ieut. Commander A. P. Osborn, U. S. N., engaged m the hydrographic resurvey of San Francisco Bay aud Harbor, was directed to lay out a 1-mile speed trial course for naval vessels. A site was selected Ill the vicimty of Angel Island and Bluff Point, and the line, known as the Bluff I'oin.t trial course, was soon Ja1d out and suitably marked. The uecessary triaugnlation was executed by Assistant E. F, Dickins, who was detailed for that purpose by Assistant A. F. Hodgers in charge of the San Francisco suboffice. Rydrographio examination of San Pedro and Santa .Monica Bays, California.-The board organir-ed by the Honorable Secretary of War, in accordance with the provisions of the river and harbor act of 1896, for the selection of a suitable site for a deep-water harbor in southern California,

UNITED STATES COAST AXD GEODETIC SURVEY.

having requested the detail of a vessel and hydrographic party to make under its direction the necessary hydrographic examinations and surveys in San Pedro and Santa Monica bays, the steamer Gedn'ey was assigned to this duty, and her commanding ofilcer, Lieut . .A. P. Osborn, was (lirected to roport to Admiral J. S. Walker, the chairman of the board. The Gedney sailed for San Pedro on the 13th of December, and between that date and February 27 made a 1,omplete hydrographic examination of San Pedro and Santa l\1onico bays and a survey of the inner barbor at San Pedro. The results of the work are plotted on three hydrographic sheets of various scales and the general statistics are as follows:
Arca souudCll in square geographical miles.............................................. 33 167 Miles (geographical) rnn while sounding ................ .'............................... Number of angles measured .........·..·..................··..................·......... 2 124 Nnmher of soundings tu.ken ..........·.................................................. 5 806

it may be here ment!oned that Assistant A. F. Rodgers served as a member of the board and attended its various meetings at Washington, D. C., and in California. On the completion of the surveys and examinations the Gedney returned to San Francisco and resumed her regular work. Seal investigations at Guadalupe Island, northwest coast of 11fexieo.-As stated under the head of "Hydrographic resurvey of San Francisco Bay and Ilarl>or," the steamer Gedney, J. . icut-Commander A. P. Osborn, U.S. N., commanding, was for a time taken off that work and by direction of the Honorable Secretary of the Treasury placed at the service of Dr. D.S .·Jordan, president of the Leland Stanford University, for the investigation of fur-seal rookeries in the island of Guadalupe, northwest coast of Me.xico. Dr. Jordan was finally unable to accompany the expedition and designated Dr. Wilbur Thoburn to take charge in his place. Dr. Thoburn and Professors Green and Wing, all of the Leland Stanford University, joined the vessel at Sausalito on the 13th of June, and the Gedney sailed for Guadalupe on the 15th, arriving there on the ~1st after a brief stop at San Pedro for coal and water and certain necessary papers expected from the Mexican authorities. From June 21 to .July 1 the ship and its steam launch were engaged in carrying the scientists to various parts of the island and the officers and crew rendered them such assistance as they required in securing and preserving specimens. During the same period a rapid running survey, or rather reconnoissance sketch, of the whole island was made and latitude observations were obtained at its northern and southern extremities. The objects of the expedition having been accomplished, the Gedney on July 1 sailed for San Francisco, reaching that point OU the 8th. Exltmination of the approache.'l to the Port Oreltm·d Naval Station.-The Honorable Secretary of the Navy having in 1897 requested an immediate Aurvey of the waters of Puget Sound adjacent to the Port Orchard Naval Station, Assistant J. J. Gilbert, who was eng·aged. on the triangulation of Washington Sound, was directed to perform this duty. On reaching Port Orchard in .June, Assistant Giluert found that a very minute survey of that part of the channel where the U. S. S. Oregon had grounded had already been completed, and the hydrography to be execute1l was therefore limited to the dredged channel affording entrance to tlie dry dock. 'fhe scale of the projection made for the purpose was 1-1 000 aud somidings were taken at regular intervals of 5 metres. 'l'he number of soundings taken was 704. Tlie topography on the same scale rncluded such changes as had l>ecn made in the wharf and lmildings, the addition of new roads, etc., and as much of the t-0wn of Bremcrtou as the limits of the sheet would permit. After completing this work, Assistant Gilbert also made a topographical survey of the water front and principal streets of the towns of Sidney and Charleston, to enable the oftice to locate these places on the charts. After completing the survey At:1sistaut Gilbert returned to San Juan Island and resumed the triangulation of Washington Sound. 1lfount St. Elias Explorin{f Expedition.-In the spring of 1897 Prof. Ilenry G. Bryant, of Philadelphia, who was fitting out an expedition for the exploration of the region about Mount St. Elias and the ascent of the mountain, requested the detail of an assistant of tho Coast and Geodetic Survey to accompany him aud assist in the observations. The necessary authorization having been obtaiued from the Honorable the Secretary of tlie Treasury, Assistant E. B. Latham was

a.;sigued to this duty, a11d was directed to report to Professor Bryant at Philadelphia on the 15th of May. A few days later the party started west and reached Seattle on the 23d. They sailed for Al.aska on the 29th, by the steamer City of Topeka, reached Sitka on .June 4, and on the following day proceeded by tlie steamer Dora to Yakutat Bay. The work of the party will consist of reconnoissauce 1 barometric determinations of elevations, azimuth observations, triangulation, and topography, and finally the ascent of Mouut St. Elias. All expenses of the expedition are to be paid by Prof. Henry G. Bryant, and by special arrangement the results of the work are to be the joint property of Professor Bryant and the Ooast and Geodetic Survey. No reports from the party had been received at the close of the fiscal year. ~Mississippi River Comm.ission.-Assistant H. L. Whiting continued to serve as a member of the Mississippi Hiver Commission until the date of his death, February 4, 1897, and attended its meetings as follows: At New York, August 26 to 29; at St. Louis and on the semiannual tour of inspection to New Orleans, .November 2 to 24. Soon after his decease he was succeeded by Assistant H. L. )farinuin, whose appointment was confirmed by the.Senate on the 22d of March. l\Tr. Marindin had previously beeu requested t-0 attend a meeting of the commission at St. Louis, Mo., and immediately 011 receipt of the notification of his confirmation proceeded to that point, arriving on the 24th of March, just in time to join the commission 011 their high-water inspection tour to New Orleans. He wm; engaged upon this U.uty until April 2, when he reached Washington and resumed his regular duty in the office. He participated in further meetings of the commission at St. Louis, Mo., in April, 1897, leaving Washington on the 27th and returning on the 2d of May, and at New York from .June 23 to~~. Assistant n. J;. Whiting until the date of his death also served as chairman of the Massachusetts State Topographical Surve,y.

ABSTRACT OF OFFIC:E ANNUAL REPORTS, FISCAI_J YEAR 1897.
ABSTRAC'r OF THE ANNUAL H.EPORT OF 'rHE ASSIST.ANT IN CHAHGE OF THE OFFICE. The report of the Assistant in Charge of the Office, 1\1r.0. H. 'l'ittmann, is accompanied by the reports of the various chiefs of divisions, and these show in detail the progress made in the various branches of the work confided to their care. Mr.'fittmann served as Assistant in Charge of the Office throughout the year, and during brief absences of the Superintendent also acted in his place. · 'rhe computing division has continued under the charge of .Assistant Charles A. ~chott, and his report shows a large amount of computation, reduction, and discussion of field results accomplished during the year. Mr. Schott has also prepared and submitted for publication a series of valuable reports on various branches of the work, four of which will appear as appendices to this report, viz: No. l, Distribution of the magnetic dip and intensity in the United States for the epoch .January 1, moo; No. 2, The telegraphic longitude net of the United States and its connection with that of Europe; No. 3, Hesalting longitudes of Kadiak, Unalaska, and Unga, Alaska, as determined chronometrically from Sitka in 1896; and No. 4 7 Resulting heights from spirit leveling between Holliday and Salina, Kans., from observations of 1895. · The computing division in April, 1897, suffered a severe loss by the sud.den death of Mr. Charles II. Kummel, an accomplished mathematician who had been connected with the Survey for nearly seventeen years. The practice of detailing members of the field force to assist in the work of the computing division when not engaged on field duty or on the computation of their own field work has been continued with beneficial results. The following-named assistants thus served. for the periods given: H. G. Ogden, from July 1 to December 12, 1896; F. A. You11g, from September 8 to December 4, 1896; A. 'l'. Mosman, from November 2, 1896, to April 7, 1897; Isaac Winston, from April 7 to May 15, 1897; .T. B. Baylor, from .Tune 21 to 30, 1897; and Aid W. Bowie, from April 19 to ,June 26, 1897. 'l'he tidal tlivision has remained in charge of Assistant H. L. M:arindin, who also served as executive officer on several occasions, matle a hydrographic survey of the mouth of the Brazos River, Texas, and served as member of the Mississippi River Commission. During bis absences from the office l\tr. L. P. Shicly acted in. bis place as chief of the tidal division. The services of Mr. Marindin in the field and as member of the Mississippi River Commission have been fully noticed under the head of "Field operations." His report of the tidal division shows a creditable amount of work accomplished during the year, and again calls attention to the desirability of an increase of the force in order to enable the office to utilize the great mass of tidal data which is constantly accumulating. Parts I and II of the Manual of Tides, by Mr. R A. Harris, have been completed and will appear as appendices to this report; Part III of this work was first prepared and was published in the report of 1894. Various members of the field force when not otherwise employed were detailed for short periods to assist in the work of the tidal division, viz: .Assistants J.B. Baylor, J. A. Flemer, W. 6. Hodgkins,·c. H. Sinclair, and D. B. Wainwright during part of January, 1897; Assistant C. T. Iardella for a portion of June, 1897, and Aid Albert F. Zust throughout the year. The report of the drawing and engraving division is submitted by Assistant Stellman Forney, acting chief of the division, as t.he regular chief, Assistant Will Vv ard Duffield, has been engaged on field. duty in Alaska since April. Messrs. Duffield and Forney have very snccessfnlly conllucted the business of the division, and the report of the latter, which is printed iu full, further gives in

detail the. amount of work accomplished iu the drawing, the engraving, the electrotyping, the photographing, and the chart-printing sections. Numerous calls for information from official aud private sources have received prompt attention, and many of these required the preparation of drawings or tracings. In the drawing section 46 chart drawings were completed during the year, and a number of others a"rc in progress; 21 original topographic sheets were inked and lettered; 23 topographic and 39 hydrograpbic projections were. constructed for field parties. Jn the engr:lviug section 51 copperplates of charts, sketches, and illustrations were completed and 76 are in progress, and 502 plates were corrected by the addition of uew data from resurveys, etc. ln the plate-printing section 1109 plates were printed from, 53 012 impressions being struck off, 47 258 of which were transferred to the chart division. In the electrotyping and photographic section 43 bassos and 33 altos were completed, 18 being for the Mexican Boundary Commission, and 10 scroll die plates were made for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the whole representing a deposit of 2 015 pounds of copper on 82 565 square inches of surface; 160 negatives and 1 822 blue, silver, bromide, and nigrosine prints were also made. The chart division has rell).ained under the charge of Assistant Gershom Bradford, wlto has conducted its business in his usual thorough and efficient manner. His report gives full informa- · tion as to the publication, distribution, and issue of charts during the year and ~he receipts therefrom. He also gives a table showing the chart distribution and receigts for each year from 1889 to 1897, from which it appears that the total distribution for 1897 is 11 per cent less than for the preceding year, but this is attributed to the fact that fewer new charts have been issued. Mr. Bradford, in additiou to his regular duties, has prepared a &,tudy of the inland water ways of the Atlantic coast of the United States from New York to Key West, and has compiled and prepared for publication a table of depths for channels and harbors of the coasts of the United States. The latter has been published as Bulletin No. 36. The instrument divisi01i has contmued under the able direction of Assistant J. F. Pratt, and his report gives full details of the work accomplished during the year in the instrument and carpenter shops. Mr. Pratt from September 28 to October 7 was absent on field duty, repairing and readjusting the Reedy Island tidal indicator, during which time the chief mechanician, J\Ir. E. G. Fischer, took charge of the division. Mr. Pratt makes special mention in his report of the reconstruction of a Gambey theodolite, the construction of a new tide-predicting machine, and certain improvements made in the self.registering tide gauges used by the Survey. He has prepared a paper on the latter subject, which will be published as an appendix to this report. The miscellaneous division has contmued under the charge of Mr. W. P. Ramsey, a1~d his report contains the usual information relative to the distribution and sale of the various publications of the Survey and the numbers of each received during the year from the Public Printer. He has, as heretofore, attended to the business with the sales agencies and examined and verified their quarterly statements. Thirteen new agencies for the sale ot: charts and other publications were established during the year aud 6 ol'd ones were discontinued. The total number of agencies now existing is lO!l. 'l'he library and archives division for the greater part of the year remained under the charge of :Mr. H. S. King, but in the latter part of May he handed in his resignation and was granted leave of absence for the month of June. Mr. Artemus Martin was designated to act as chief during his abseuce, and was subsequently appointed to the position, the appointment taking effect July 1, 1897. Mr. Martin's report contains the usual statistical information relating to additions to the library and the receipt and registration of field records, topographic and hydrographic sheets, etc. In the immediate office of the Assistant iu Charge 110 changes occurred during the year, Messrs. A. B. Simons and E. B. Wills and Misses Sophie Hein and Kate· Lawn continuing. to perform their respective duties as heretofore. ABSTRAO'l' OF THE ANNUAL REPOltT OF 'rHE HYDROGRA.PHIC INSPEOTOR . . Lieut. Commander H. G. 0. Colby, U. S. N., continued to serve as Hydrographic Inspector until December 23, 1896, at which date he was relieved by Lieut. Commander E. D. Taussig, U: S. N., nn officer who had previously had considerable experience in the hydrographic field work ot the Surve.)'. Lieutenaut·Commander Taussig has submitted a very full and detailed report of

54

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC 8URVEY.

all the hydrographic and other work executed during the year by the naval parties under his charge, accompanied by the nsual reports of the office work of the Hydrographic and Coast Pilot divisions, which are also under his general direction. During the year the Hydrographic Inspector bas visited and inspected all the naval parties in the field and their vessels, with a view to securing greater uniformity in the methods of work and at the same time enabling him to judge intelligently of the proper allotments to be made for repairs and party expenses. He highly commends the zeal and efficiency displayed by aill the parties in the prosecution of the surveys assigned them, and reports that a very gratifying amount of work has in each case been accomplished. The repairs made during the year to the various vessels of the Survey, and the amounts of money expended in each case, are shown in detail, and the usual statistical tables also accompany the report. The hydrographic surveys of the year cover an aggregate area of 1 029 square nautical miles, and the aggregate length of lines of sounding run is 11 :n7 nautical miles, 'the number of angles measured to locate soundings is nearly 130 000 and tbe number of soundings taken over :)70 000. The hydrographic division continued under the immediate charge of Lieut. H. Hodman, U.S. N., until April 28, 18!)7, when be was assigned to sea duty. J_,ieut. G. Tarbox, U.S. N., chief of the coast pilot divisio11, then assumed charge, filling at the same time both positions until June 15, when he was detatched, his services being required by the Navy Department. Lieut. J.C. Gillmore, U. S. N., reported for duty on the rnth of June, and assumed charge of the hydro. graphic division the same day. His report embraces the whole fiscal year, and shows that a very satisf'actory amon11t of work has been accomplished. Forty-five hydrographic sheets were completed in this division, and 'these involved the examination of 308 volumes of records and the platting of over 12;) 000 angles and 436 000 soundings. Besides this a large amount of miscellaneous work received attention; 277 drawings and proofs of charts were verified, 149 miscellaneous drawings and tracings were made, 5 679 charts were corrected to date, from data obtained from field surveys and resurveys, and comparisons of old and new surveys were made. The monthfy Notices to 1\Iariners were also compiled and prepared for publication. Lieutenant Gillmore confirms the reports of his predecessors as to the zeal and efficiency of the employees of the division, and has words of commendation for all. 'l'he coast pilot division continued under the immediate charge of Ensign Glennie Tarbox, U. S. N., until June 15, 1897, when he was recalled by the Navy Department, as already stated above. Be was succeeded on June 19 by Lieut. J.C. Gillmore, U.S. N. The report for the year, however, is submitted by Ensign Tarbox, who states fully the progress of the work and makes valuable suggestions regarding its future conduct. 'l'he compilation of Part VIII of the Coast Pilot, including the whole Gulf Coast from Key ·west to the Rio Grande, was completed and sent to the printer in December, and was finally issued early in April. Supplements to Parts IV and V, containing additional informa~ion and corrections to date, have also been completed. A second edition of Part VI, embracing Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, is in _course of preparation, and much material for it is already on hand. As some time must elapse, however, before this can be completed, as extensive field surveys remain to be made, a supplement to the first edition, containing the important infor1i;iation now available, has been prepal'ed and is now in press. 'l'he coast pilot division has also been charged with the selection and establishment of ranges at various points by which mariners may determine the deviation of their compasses. This important matter has never before received the attention it deserves, and the ranges now being established will prove of great value to the maritime interests. The ranges will be fully described in later editions of the Coast Pilot, and their true and magnetic bearings will be given. They will also be shown as far as practicable on the Uoast Survey charts. The Hydrographic Inspector's report and the accompanying reports of the clliefs of the hydrographic and coast pilot divisions are printed in full further on under the title of Office Heport No. 2,

ABSTRACT OF 'rHE ANNGAL REPOH.T OF 'fHE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE OF THE OFFICE OF STANDARD WEIGH'rS AND ME.ASUHB8. This important office has continued under the charge of Assistant Andrew Braid, whose annual report is published as Office Report No. 4. 'rhe usnal amount of work for other departments of the Government and for outside parties has been accomplished, and prompt response has been made to the numerous calls for information. Assistant Braid urges the necessity of increased approp'riations for the purpose of enabling the office to acquire instrum('lnts which are necessary for the electrical standards work about to be undertaken, and provision therefor has consequently been made in the estimates submitted for the fiscal year 1899. 'rhe work of the year has principally consisted of the verification, adjustment, and standardization of various standards of length, weight, and capacity, thermometers, alcoholometers, salinometers, etc., but special mention is made of certai11 .mportant operations not of the regular routine order. 'rhe results for the year have been highly satisfactory, and it is gratifying to observe the growing recognition and appreciation of the importance of the work of this office, not only by other departments but also by the general public. Since the close of the fiscal year important work in connection with the testing and standardization of polariscopes and other apparatus used by the customs service in determining the rate of ·duty to be imposed on import sugars has been u11dertakei1 and is now in progress. 'l'his work belongs to the fiscal year 1898, but it is merely referred to here as apropos to the subject under consideration. A tabular statement of the verifications, standardization, etc., for other departments or bureaus and for outside parties accompanies the weights and measures report. Assistant Andrew Braid, in addition to bis duties as chief of the Weights anrl Measures Office, has attended to the preparation, compilation, and editing of the Superintendent's Annual Report, and served as a member of the advisory boards on instruments, publications, and library. SUPBRINTENDBNT'S OFFIOE. 'l'he Superintendent in July, 1896, proceeded to the 'West coast for the purpose of inspecting the work of the Alaskan field parties and examining the various inlets reaching to the probable boundary line between southeast Alaska and British Columbia. Be, accompanied by Lieut. IT. Rodman, U. S. N., joined the steamer Patterson at Seattle on the 14th of July, and after visiting the head of Portland Oaual, Clarence Strait, nnd llehm Canal, and the various inlets as far as Yakutat Bay, returned to Peril Strait and inspected the methods of surveying practiced by the uaval officers on board the Patterson. Proceeding to San Francisco in August, he inspected the suboffice and the field parties engaged in the resurvey of San Francisco Harbor, and finally returned to Washington on the 14th of September. During this absence and subsequent briefer ones, Assistant 0. IT. 'l'ittmann acted as Superintendent, Assistant RD. Preston as Assistant in Charge of the Office, and Assistant H. L. l\Iarindin as executive ollicer. Except for the periods mentioned, Assistant E. D. Preston served as executive officer throughout the year. The Oilice of Standard Weights and Measures, its stated in the preceding paragraph, remained throughout the year under the direction of Assistant Andrew Braid, who also had charge of the preparation of the Snperiute11de11t's Annual Report. l\ir. G. J,. Flower, having been promoted to a position on the field force, was succeeded as private secretary on July 22, 1896, by Mr. A. IL Bailey, who ~erved for the remainder of the fiscal year. Mr. William B. Chilton served as clerk in the Snpermtendent's office throughout the year. DISBURSING OFFICE. Mr. R J. Griffin served· as disbursing agent until March 24-, 1897, when he resigned, and was succeeded by Mr. Scott Nesbit, whose annual repo1·t giving a detailecl statement of all expc111litnres ma<~e during the year is given in full as Office Report No. 3. No change has occurred in the cler1~al force of this oflice, Mr. N. G. Henry, Miss Ida M. Peck, and Mrs. Jennie H. Fitch having contmued to perform satisfactorily their respective duties.

SUBOFFICE. The suboffice at San Francisco, Cal., continued in charge of Assistant A. F. Rodgers throughout the year~ but during his absences at Washington, D. 0., and Los Angeles, Cal., on duty as member of the Santa Monica-San Pedro Deep Water Harbor Board, he was temporarily relieved by Assistants J .·J. Gilbert and .E. F. Dickins, the former acting from November 10 to February 8, and tbe latter from February 9 to April 3. Assistant l~odgers, in addition to the usual office work devolving upon llim, has directed and exercised supervision over various field operations, such as the topographical resurvey of San Francisco Bay and Harbor, the incidental triangulation, the running of the Sausalito tidal station, sundry special examinations of reported dangers to naviga· tion, and the establishment of a new astronomical observatory at Presidio and its connection with the old one at J,afayette Park. Iu the field and office work under his charge he has been aided at various times by Assistants .J. J. Gilbert, E. F. Dickins, Fremont Morse, and 0. B. French, and Messrs. Ferdinand West<lahl and Frank W. Edmunds. Mr. H. S. Ballard served as tidal observer throughout the year, and .Mr. Vincent Denis has continued to perform messenger and miscellaneous duty. OBITUAHY. On receipt of the intelligence of tbe death of Assistant Henry L. Whiting, the Superintendent called a meeting of the officers and members of the Coast Survey to take such action as they deemed ad vi sable in the matter, and on their convening addressed them as follows:
GENTLEMEN: To-<lay's mail brings the painful intelligeueo of the su<lclen death of Assistunt l-Ienr~· L. Whitiug at his home in llostou, Maas. Mr. 'Vhiting wa.s the senior Assistant of tho CoaJlt Survey, his first appoiutmont dating .July 6, 1838. Had lw ]i,·ed until next .July he wonld have served in that bureau fifty-nine ~·ears. ·ne was born Felirnary 5, 1821, ancl died on the day preceding the anniversary of his birth, February 1, 1897, having nearly completed bi.~ seventy-sixth year. The Jaw which compels the withered leaf to fall, which gathers the ripened grain to it8 place of rest, is not n harsh and crnel, but n wise and benevolent one. 'Ve must not, therefore, rebel against its enforcement. Mr. "rhiting's life haH been a busy one. He has made his murk upon the generation in which ho lived. Ile has aidecl the worl<l in its forward progress. But his task is finished, his work is done. His life has bccu fully rounclecl out and completecl. He has outlived tho throe score years aud ten which tho Psalmist allots to suffering humanity; he has been gathered like a shock of grain fully ripe. I have therefore taken the liberty of calliug you together to decide what action you demn a1lviHable in the matter of Mr. 'Vhiting's death, and in what form yon will give expression to that action.

Assistant Charles A. Schott moved that a committee of five be appointed by the Superintendent to act in the matter. The Superintendent appointed Messrs. Schott, Mosman, Iardella, Marindiu, and Tittmann as snch committee. · At a subsequent meeting the following resolutions were adopted, and the Superintendent was requested to forward a copy of them to Mr. Whiting's relatives, with a biographical sketch of his services in the Coast Survey, such resolutions and sketeh to be entered in the Superintendent's Annual Heport.

BIOGHAPHICAL SKETCH.
UNITED STATES CoA,;T AND G1·:01n:Tic Su1n'EY,

11'ashi11glo11, I>. C., F1:b1·11a1·y Ii, 1897'. 1'o the members of the United States Cdast mid Geodetic S111'vey: It becomes my painful duty to announce to yon the death of our oldest and most faithful Assistant of tlw

Survey. Henry L. Whiting, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Stir\'oy, died at his hom<i on Marthas Vineyard, l\lassachuset.ts, February 4, 18!17, in tho senmty-sixth year of his age, and iu the fifty-ninth year of liis sl'rvicos on the Coast Survey. Assistant \Vhiting was boru in Albany, N. Y., February Ii, 1821, and entered the Survey in .July, 1838, ns topographer, and ho was the last snrviYor who served under all tho Suporintendnnts t.110 Sul'\·oy has had. Duriug his extraordinarily long career he most faithfully devoted his euergies to hiR life's task, n'lld it can justly bo said that to him more than to anyone else is duo tho development of tho art of topography on tho Snrvoy. How· much his services were appreciated in this 1liroction, aUtl tho confidence placed in his ability by tho several chiefs of tho SurYoy, are abundantly shown by tho fact that he was from early times frequently called upon to inspect. the fioltl work of other survey parties, aml that his counsel was sought in qulll!tions of improvomeut of navigation nut! invost.igations of chauges in natural features of coast and harbor lines. Though the field of his principal lu.bors was on the coasts of Maine, Massachusetts, Rhoclo Island, mHl .l\ew York, we find him nlso engaged in special surveys along the coast as for south as Florida, and in 1876 he was directed to inspect the topography so far executed on our Pacific Coast and report as to tho best manner of its continuation, under pressing conditions. ln 1866 he wu.s detailed for a time as instructor in practical survey~ to tho Naval Academy at Annapolis. In 186!) his knowledge of tho features of the coast was called for in the location of tho' trans-Atlantic cable at Duxbury, Mass. It was, however, in the dir(lction of the iiorformance of larger and more responsible duties that ho rendered the most important services. Thus, in 1884, we fiml him appointed as one of three commissioners to conduct tbo topographic sun·ey of the Stato of l\111ssac!tus11tts, which afterwards dev(lloped into n comp lo to trigonometric sune~·, including town as well as State boundaries. Of this work ho has heon director since 1892, nnd one of his last acts, bnt n fow days ago, waa in tho intorest of the continuance of the trigonometric survey of the State. He was also a melllber of the board of harbor commissioners for Boston Harbor. A not less important position was fille<l b~· him as a member of tho Mississippi Hiver Commission. His appointment to the latter dates from .hmo 10, 1890, an<l the duties connected therewith were faithfully discharged by him to the time of his death. Since his appointment in 1884 us one of tho commissioners of the topographic survey of the Stnto of Massachusetts his acti \'O Held dutioa as an Assistant of tho Coast Survey have ceased. Yet he still retained tho position of au AssiRtnnt, and· as such represented the Coast Survey upon both the topographic survey of 111ussnchusotts aud tho Mississippi Hivor Commission. \Vi th him a most useful life hns passed away, and his devotion to his duties may Nerve 11s 11n example worthy to bo followed.

<Jharles Hugo Kummell, computer, died at Washington, D. <J., on the 17th of April, 1897, in the sixty-first year of his age. He was born at Wetter, Blectora.te of Hesse Cassel, Prussia, and was educated at the Polytechnic School at Cassel and at the UniYersity of Marburg. He came to the United States in August, 1860, and was engaged in teaching mathematics and music until appointed to a position on United States Lake Survey in 1871. He served with the Lake Survey until October 31, 1880, and in November of the same year accepted a position as computer in the omce of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. 'l'he latter position he held to the date of his death. · Mr. Kummell was an able mathematieiau, rind at various times contributed valuable mathematical papers and solutions of intricate problems to the mathematical and astronomical journals and to the annual reports of the <Joast and Geodetic Survey. His knowledge and experience and bis amiable disposition made him a valued member of the computiug force of the ollice, and one whose loss is much and sincerely regretted.

OFFICE REPORT N0 .. 1-1897.
REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT l:N CHARGE OF THE OFFICE FOR THE FISCAL YE.AH. ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.
UNITED ST.A.TES Co.A.S'.I.' .AND GEODE'l'IO SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, D. G., June 30, 1897. GENERAL: I have the honor to submit herewith the annual reports of the heads of the various subdivisions of this Otnce, which are so detailed that but little comment is necessary, but certain principal matters may be here rnentione<l. The computing division bas carried forward the computations of the great transcontinental arc. It has completed the adjustment of the telegraphic longitude connection of North America and Europe, and of the primary longitude net of the United States, and prepared these results for publication. Extensive papers on the distribution of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity for the epoch January, 1900, have also been prepared for publication. In the tidal division the proof of the Tide Tables for 1897 was read and the predictions for the tables of 1898 were completed, and the predictions for forty stations for 1899 were made. The preparation of P~rtR I and II of the Manual of Tides was continued by Dr. Harris. The necessity of an increase in the force of computers is pointed out, and I concur in the recommendation of the chief of this division in regard to this matter. In the drawing and engraving division many of the charts have been corrected from survey::; made under the direction of the Chief of Engineers, by whose courteous cooperation much valuable information is promptly furnished to this office. The operations of the printing section have been facilitated by the substitution of a 600-ton hydraulic press for the roller calendering press formerly used. The details of the operations of the chart division require 110 mention other than the report itself. The chief of that division, in addition to his regular duties, prepared at my instance a Table of Depths of the Channels and IIarbors of the Coast of the United States, which has been published as Bulletin No. 36. The miscellaneous dh'ision calls attention to an increase in the number of agencies for the sale of charts. The instrument division notes the progress made in the construction of the tide-predicting machine, for the use of the tidal division, and the construction of new tide gauges on improved designs. In regard to the library and archives, it has seemed to me a wise policy to restrict the accumulation of books to the necessities of the office and not to attempt the collection of a large number. No change has been made in the immediate office of the .Assistant in Charge. ::\fr. A. B. Simons has continued to act as clerk to the Assistant in Charge, attending to manifold duties, including the keepmg of the accounts of the moneys received by this Office. Mr. Eugene B. Wills has bad charge of leave of absence record and the shipment of materials from this office. l\iiss Sophie S. Hein and M18s Kate Lawn have attended to the typewriting and many miscellaneous duties appertaimng to their desks. In addition to Ins other dut10s the Assistant m Charge has acted as Superintendent during your absence. Yours, very respectfully,
0. H. 'l'IT'.l'MANN,

REPOHT OF THE COJIPUTING DIVISION, COAS'l' AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, FOR 'l'HE FISCAL YEAH ENDD.G JUNE 30, 1897.
COMPU'.l'ING DIVISION, .Jmw .'JO, 18.91.

SrR: Iu conformity with the regnlatious and usage of the Survey, l have the honor to present

herewith my annual report of the WOl'k done by the members of the compnting division <luring the fiscal year endlug .Jnue 30, 18D7. The charge of this division has remained with the undersigned. I regret to liave to state the loss the computing division suffered in the death of C.H. Kumrnell, which occurred April 17, 1897. }Ir. Kummell was au accomplished mathematician, and was connected with this division of the office since November 8, 1880. The place has not yet been fil_led, and the force was still further reduced by the enforced absence through ill health of H. F. Flynn, who wns temporarily assigned to field duty after a severe sickness in February last. Some assistance was given by short assignments t-0 oflice work of members of the field force. 'fhe division remains without a clerk. The various duties devolved upon the chief of this division are so well known as not to be in need of yearly restatement; it is sufficient to say that they were promptly attended to, though the annual official correspondence, 'as referred to this division, appears to increase in volume. 'fhree important and extensive papers were prepared for publication, in which I had the effective aid of l\fr. Hazard, of this division.. They are entitled "Distribution of the magnetic declination in the United States for the epoeh January, 1900," with two charts; "Distribution of the magnetic clip and the magnetic intensity in the United States for the epoch January, 1900," with thl'ec charts; and "The telegraphic longitude connection of North America and Europe and adjustment of the longitude net of the United States,'' with a map. The first paper is published in the 1891i report; the secoml contains results of observations of dip and intensity at mol'e than 1 600 stations, together with the charted values for the advanced epoch; the third paper contains the individual results of telegraphic differences of longitude for 4;3 stations and the adjustment of tl1e 72 differences of longitude; the older cable connection with the European system is now strengthened by the introduction of the Canadian determiuation of 1892. Four papers on results of spirit leveling were prepared for publication as appendices to the 1896 report. The general introduction explanatory of the transcontinental triangulation was written out, as well as an account of eight of the ten base lines contained in it; this includes statement of the position of th1~ bases, their unit of measure, resulting length and probable error, adjustment of the base net, and probable error of the sides joining the net to the triangulation. I have also kept up to date the discussion of the magnetic elements. A condensed specification of the work done by each computer during the fiscal year is here with submitted; it is made up from the daily and monthly reports. Edward H. Courtenay was engaged m:tinly in the computations and adjustments of the triangulations, viz, coast of Texas, Sabine Pass to the Brazos River, 1848-188~; C<lte Blanche and Vermillion bays, 1855-1890; computed spirit levels in connection with the Salt Lake and Salina base lines; computed a number of abstracts of horizontal directions of principal stations in Kansas, ~Iaryland, and Delaware, and prepared them for publication; attended to a number of miscellaneous geodetic computations; supplied data required for field or other parties; had charge of the geographical registers and of duplicates of records, and supervised part of the work of several of the younger computers. Myrick H. Doolittle was chiefly engaged in the preparation of abstracts of vertical angles at. all the primary stations in the transcontinental triangulation passing through Nevada, Utah, and Colorado, to close of field season of 1896; he prepared also abstracts of horizontal directions of stations about the Salt Lake base, and adjusted the base net, and computed the height of stations between Mount Diablo and Point Arena, Cal. Charles H. Kummell was engaged in the computation of· geographic positions in Texas and Louisiana, iu solving equations, and ou miscellaneous geodetic work; be also computed the azimuth of stations Los Angeles northwest, Los Angeles southeast, Mount 'foro, Point Isabella, :Minneapolis, and Salina, 1896. J.B. Boutelle computed part of triangulations of Hudson Hiver~ New York, 1854-18!l5; of Perdido Bay, Florida; Perdido H.iver aud coast between Pensacola Bay and Perdido Bay, and

of Brazos H.iver, Texas, 189G, all<l San Francisco Bay, 1897; computed a number of geographic positions in 'l'exas, Louisiana, and Florida; attended to miscellaneous geodetic computations, to e11tel'ing of position into the geographic registers, to copying of reports, an<l other clerical work. Daniel L. Hazard computed the following difforences of telegraphic longitudes: El Paso and Austin, Austin aud Laredo, Austin and Galveston, Austin and~ ew Orleans, Cambridge and Calais, Key \Vest and Charleston, all of 1895; and 'Vasliington and Cambridge, Wasliington and Itliaca, Ithaca and Cambridge, Washington old and new sities of U11ited States Naval Observatory, Key West and Atlanta, Atlanta and Little H.ock, Washington and Charleston, Albany and Cambridge, Albany and Montreal, Albany old and new site of observatory; San Francisco, Lafayette Park and. Presidio stations; Washington, Old Naval Observatory and Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, all of 1896, aud v\T ashiugton and Dover· of 1897; revised also older telegraphic longitude abstracts and assisted me in tlie preparation a paper Oil the telegraphic longitude results. He computed the astronomic azimuth of Uncompahgre, Colo.; Mount Conness, Cal.; .Mocho, Cal.; Unalaska, Alaska; and Minneapolis, Minn., and revised several azimuth computations. Mr. Hazard also computed the chronometric differences of longitude between Sitka a11d Kadiak and Unalaska, Alaska, 18!lG, aud computed the magnetic observations made by Baylor, Putnam, and Faris in 189G, and those by Baylor and French in 18H7. He revised also tlte collection of dips and intensities of Appendix No. 1, Report for 1897, a8 prepared by me. As in preceding years, the amount of work done by this computer is remarkable for its magnitude. Harry F. Flynn computed the following astronomic latitudes: Patmos Head, Utah; Wasatch, C"tah; Tavaputs,Colo.; Ellsworth and Wallace in Kansas; Pikes Peak and Uncompahgre iu Colorado, and Union City, Ind. After February 15, 1897, with the exception of nine days iq May, the computing division lost his services, first on account of sickness, ~nd about a month later by assi1:rnment to field duty for restoration of his health. Lilian Pike was principally engaged on the computation of astronomic latitudes; assisted ht the revision of the table of magnetic dips aud intensities; computed the length of the speed·trial course i11 San Francisco Bay; prepared abstracts of vertical measure for Iieights in Kansas; solved normal equations; and assisted in revisions or checking of various geodetic work. Francis \V. Clay plotted magnetic stations and results for dip and intensity for the epoch moo; computed geographic positions in the States of New York and Louisiana; solved normal equations; attencled to some work in con11ection with the tidal divisiou; reduced horizontal directions of the triangulation about Salina base, Kansas, and of the primary branch from Kent Island to Cape May, 1896-97. He attended also to miscellaneous geodetic revisions and to copying of informatiou needed in the field. 'l'he following members of the field force were temporarily assigned for duty in this division: II. G. Ogden was engaged in the computation of apparent places of stars; assisted in the computation of the triangulation of the coast of Texas, 1848-188~, putting the same on modern data; prepared abstracts of horizontal directions, triangulation of Vermilion Ray, IJouisiana. I-le was detaclied from the computing division on December 12, 18!!6. F. A. Youug, assistant, reported for duty September 8, 189G, and left for field work DecemlJer 4, 189G. During this interval he revised spirit-level results prepared for publication and computed apparent places of stars. A. 'l'. Mosman, assii:itant, was assigned to duty in this division November 2, 18!)(), Ile computed ihc time and azimuth at the following stations: l\Iou nt Tol'o, Santa Lucia, and San ta Ana, California, all of .1.88;'); Point Isabel, Texas, Ralch and Ranier, Oregon, of 1886; Minneapolis, Jli1rn., and Fitzsimmons, Wis., of 1887; Fort Johnson, Charlotte, S.

REPORT OF THE 'rIDAL DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIU SURVEY OFFICE, FOR 'l'HE FISCAL YEAH ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.

June 30, 1897. Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report of the tidal division for the fiscal year ending June 30, 18U7: 'rhe reading of the proof of the Tide Tables for 1897 was completed; the predictions for 1898 for the 44 stations remaining at the close of my last report were made, as also an extensive reviHion of certain columns of 'rable 3, 'fide Tables for 1898, and the whole tables were read and revised in proof. ·while these tables are essentially similar to those for 1897, a number of new stations were added in Table 3, espedally on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. The explanation of tables has been made a little more detailed, and I have added a list of authorities to which we are i11debted for valuable tidal da a. The work of preparing the Tide Tables for 1899 was taken up as soon as the tables for 1898 were out of the way, and predictions have been made for 40 stations. Harmonic analyses have been made for a year each of hourly ordinates at Cedar Keys, Pensacola, and Tortu gas Harbor, Florida; 'l'ampico, Mexico; and Yokohama, Japan. Short series of lwurly ordiuates were a11alyzed for Havre, France; Lisbou, Portugal; Cape Horn, South America; and Port Hussell, New Zealand. 'l'he summations have been made for a year each of hourly ordinates at 'Willets Point, N. Y.; Washington, D. C.; and St. Marks light, Florida, constituting the most laborious portion of an harmo11ic analysis for these places. The total work done 011 the harmonic analysis during the year is the equivalent of tlte complete analysis of about niue years of contiuuous records. The 11onharmo11ic reductions completed duriug the year consist of 14 series, the equivaleut of about four years of continuous observatio11s. Several auxiliary tables have been computed to assist in our work, the most extensive being an enlargement of the table of' coefficients for correcting the uuelimiuated effect of' one harmonic compoue.nt upon another. 'l'he preparation of Parts I and II of the Manual of Tides has been continued. fo the preparation of the historical. matter pertaining to Part I, the tidal work accomplished by Newton, Bernoulli, Lubbock, Whewell, Airy, and Ferrel bas been gone over in considerable detail, while many other workers on tides have been more briefly noticed. A good deal of study has been given to the subject of water waves under several assumed conditions, and au effort has been made to explain the tides as they exist in nature by the theories applicable to them under various circumstances. 'fide notes have been prepared and furnished for 72 stations on 23 charts. Hequisitions from 18 field parties have been filled, requiring the description of 75 bench marks and tidal data for :m stations. 'l'idal information has been called for hy !)5 persons not connected with the Survey, the response to which required the prepamtion of 5G dcscriptio11s of bench marks, current tables for 7 stations, and tidal data for 189 stations, together with technieal letters explainiug tidal phenomena. An aggregate of about twelve years of record from automatic tide gauges has been received, examined, and registered. 'fhere were 100 original and 89 duplicate volumes of tidal observations made uy bydrographic parties with staff and box gauges, as well as records of' currents at 8 staTIDAL DlVISION,

tions, which have been received, examined, and regist~red in this division during the year. About two years of tabulated hourly heights of the sea, times and heights of high and low waters, and temperatures and densities of the sea, and meteorological data were received.
PRINCIPAL SERIES OP TID.A.L OBSERVATIONS MADE DURING 'l'llE FISCAL YEAR.

Automatic tide gauge and tide indicator maintained in operation at Fort Hamilton, 'l'/w Narrows, New York Hai·bor.-The automatic tide gauge and tide indicator, established in December, 1892, and in May, 1893, respectively, on the wharf of Fort Hamilton, New York Harbor, with the permission of tpe commanding omcer of the fort, have been kept in successful operation during the fisca.1 year. 'fbe station has been in charge of Mr. J. G. Spaulding throughout the year. Automatic tide gauge and tide indicator 11utintained in operation at Reedy bland Quarantine Sta.tion, Dela:ware.-The automatic tide gauge and indicator, which were established at Reedy Islarnl Quarantine Station, Delaware B.iver, Delaware, in January, 1896, have been continued throughout the year, with some rather bad breaks in the record. The gauge and indicator are under the ·direction of Dr. A. H. Glennan, surgeon, Marine-Hospital Service, with various observers. Automatic tide f/attge at Washington Navy-Yard, District of Oolumbia.-The tide gauge, which was established in July, 1891, at the navy-yard, Washington, D. C., with the permission of the commandant of the yard, has been kept in successfnl operation during the fiscal year. The gauge has been attended by the members of the tidal division of this office, under the direction of Assistant H. L. Marindin. Automatic tide gauge cstabli.~hcd at Sparrow.~ Point, Md.-This gauge was established at Sparrows Point, Patapsco River, Maryland, in April, 1897, and the record continued to the end of the fiscal year . .Automatic tide gauge maintained at Port Royal Naval Sta.tion, South Carolina.. -This automatic tide gauge, which was established in April, 1896, with the permission of the commanding officer of the station, was continued until April, 1897, when the station was discontinued. The gauge was in charge of Mr. B. W. Weeks . .1lutomatic tide gauge cstabli.yhed at Fcmandina, Fla.-An automatic tide gauge was established at Fernandina, Fla., in May, 1897, and was kept in operation to the end of the fiscal year. The gauge is in charge of l\fr. B. W. Weeks. Automatic tide gauge maintained at Sausalito, Cal.-The automatic tide. gauge, which was established at Sausalito, Cal., in February, 1897, has been kept in successful operation during the fiscal year. The gauge is in charge of Mr. H. S. Ballard, under the direction of Assistant A. F. Rodgers. Tidal and current observations in Seymour Narr01cs, British Columbia.-This Survey has secured the consent of the Canadian Government to make a series of tidal and current observations at Seymour Narrows, on the north side of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and the commander or the steamer Patterson left a party there, which it is hoped has been successful in sec1uing satisfactory observations, but their report will not be received in time for this report. Tidal observations from the United States engineers have b'een received from 12 stations on the Cape Fear River, North Carolina, the record being mostly for day tides only, and varying in length at the different stations from a few weeks to a number of years. 'l'idal ob~ervations from the Canadian Government have been received for nearly two years of record of each of the following places: Sand Heads, Garry Point, and New Westminster, on the Fraser River, and at Victoria, Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Tidal observations from Lisbon, Portugal, for the month of January, 18!)7, have been received from A .·T. Pinto Basto, lieutenant, commanding the .lfaudovy, Portuguese navy.

Wainwright read first proof of our 'l'ide Tables for 1898 iu ,January, 1897; Assistant O. T. Iardella, June 23-30, 1897, copied tidal re.cords for Southport, N. C.; and Mr. Albert F. Zust, aid, has been with us the whole year. The need for additional help in this division i8 so great that it would be true economy to provide for at lenst two additional computers. It would be most satisfactory if one of the new places could be a computer at $1 800 nnd the other at $9110 per annum, as this arrangement would permit of very worthy promotions in the present force. The great mass of accumulated tidal records can not be used for the l>enefit of navigation unless the working force of this division is increased. It gives me plea1mre to testify to the zealous interest in their work which has characterized the members of this (Ii vision throughout the year. Hespectfully, yours, HENRY L. MAIUNDIN,

The old or expert engravers Lave been generally employed, as beretofore stated, on l>ranches of work which they have made specialties, except when their assistance was necessary in making corrections arising from resurveys and in preparing the work for publication. This fiscal year has been exceptional in the amount of correction of plates required, for most of the new editions of charts issued have been corrected from recent surveys of the Corps of Engineers, U. S. A., involving a great deal of change not only in the work itself but in the notes to give the necmisary credit. As stated in the report for the fiscal year 1896, it has been of great advantage to the engraving division to form part of the drawing division, for where a reduction of new work has been necessary to advance a plate for publication the reduction h:Ls been made with the least possible delay, and as a consequence we have saved a great deal of time and have been able to give the latest information on the charts. Experience shows conclusively that the consolidation of the two divisions was just what was needed for the good of the service, and has resulted in au improvement in the condition of the charts. Under the engraving contract awarded to R. 11'. Bartle & Co., June 28, 1895, the following plates \Vere completed during the fiscal year: "

The requisitious for printing from the chart division ham not been as large as during the previous year, and there has not been any serious delay in supplying the demands for charts. The prompt supply is mainly due to the management of Mr. D. N. Hoover, the foreman in charge of the printing. 'l'he personnel of the printing rooms has remained unchanged, with the exception of the death of George B. Crawford, printer; the transfer of Paul \V. Dexter, printer's helper, to the chart division, and the promotion of Frank C. Gohre, printer's helper, to be printer~ June 12, 1897. 'l'he preseut. force is as follows: Plate printers, D. N. Iloove1· (foreman), Charles ,J. Harlow, Eberhard Fordan, J"ames L. Smith, and Frnnk U. Gohre; helpers, Charles F. Locruft, Louis J,. Willianu;, William M. Conn, and Uharles \V. Buckingham. The electrotype and photograph rooms, under the management of J\lr. Louis P. Keyser, have been properly carried on and have been very successful in the development of all kinds of work that require intelligent and businesslike c.apacity. During the year electric lights were introduced in the photograph rooms, enabling us to print. and make negatives in cloudy we:i.ther without depending on sunlight, and consequently a great deal of loss of time has been avoided. l\lr. 'fhomas Roy se1·ve<l as assistant electrotyper and photographer throughout tlie year. The general work of the division has been performed by Mr. John H. Smoot in his usual acceptable manner. The correspondence and detail work connected with photolithographing" was performed by Mr. Artlmr Il. Bailey in a satisfactory manner until August 9, 1896, wllen he was transferred to the office of the Superintendent. On September 2, 189G, Mr .·Joseph .M. Morgan was duly transferred

under civil-service rules and performed satisfactory service until transferred to the United States Treasury Department on December 28, I89G. Mr. James M. Griffin was duly certified by the Civil Service Commission 011 January 28, 18!)7, and has since that date satisfactorily performed the clerical duties of the division. 'rhe chief of the division, l\fr. Will Ward Duffield, having been ordered to Alaska on official business, I was detailed by the Superintendent, on April 2, 1897, to take charge of the division as acting chief: By direction of the Superintendent, Mr. Ed win H. Fowler was assigned as chief draftsman of the drawing section of this office on June 24, 18!l7, and placed in charge of the draftsmen and the details of that section. .i\Ir. Fowler has not been in charge long enough to show any material improvement in the results of the drawing section up to ,June 30, 18!l7, but I am satisfied tl1at with his experience and capacity to do work he will introduce methods which will bring about greater uniformity in the style of drawing and greatly advance the progress of the operations or the section under his c!Jarge. "\Vi th the approval of the Assistant in Charge, I assigned Mr. 'Villi am A. Thompson, engraver, on .June 22, 1897, to have the general supervision of the work of t!Je engravers. I find that during t!Je short time he has been acting in this capacity satisfactory results are being obtained and a greater uniformity in the style of engraving has already shown itself. The printing section has been ably conducted under t!Je supervision of Mr. D. N. Hoover, printer's foreman, and a. satisfactory amount of work bas been turned out from the printing rooms during the time I have been i11 charge of the drawing and engraving division. I respectfully call attention to the advisability of attaching electric power to one of our printing presses. I have for some time been investigating this matter and have ascertained that a suitable motor can be obtained. 1.'be electrotyping and photographing section bas been conducted by Mr. J,. P. Keyser in an efficient and satisfactory manner. Consi1lering the limited facilities he has bad for blueprinting, he has turned out a large number of priuts. It would he advisable to enlarge the rooms in this section so that the assistant electrotyper could assist him in getting out work. At present they are too small to admit of two persons working together. T!Je electric plant for photographing and blueprinting 011 dark, cloudy days has so far given satisfactory results. In conclusion, I desire to express my appreciation of the cordial and faithful performance of work by all the members of t!Je division nuder my direction. I wis!J to call special attention to the ellicient auct faithful services rendered by Ur .·John H. Smoot., chief clerk of the division, and Mr. James l\J. Griffin, clerk. The latter receives a very small salary, and I recommend that an increase be given him at the earliest opportunity. Hespectfully submitted.

I wonld call attention to the fact tliat the force has been considerably smaller in the past two years titan previously since the formation of the division, and that the work has been q nite as well performed, which I consider due partly to impl'oved methods and partly to greater efficiency in the force as a body.

'fhe total issne is 11 per cent smaller than that of last year, but 2 per cent larger than the average of the previous eight years. 'l'he free distribution is 12 per cent smaller than last year, bnt 21 per cent larger than the average. The net sales (gross sales, less copies returned hy sale agents) have decreased in copies and value 14 per cent, as compared with the previous year, and 17 per ce11 t in copies and value, as compared witli the average. 'fhis result may be attributed, to some extent, to the fact that fewer new charts have been published than heretofore. The e(lition of the cha.rt catalogue for 18!)(3 was received in August and 2 000 copies l1ave since been distributed. The correspondence for the year has amounted to 2 449 letters written. There have been <lelivered in this division for is::me during thP. past year eight new charts and maps, all printed by lithography, viz:

The repairs of the office buildings and furniture, i11cludi11g the construction of necessary file cases, have been lrnt up as usual, the former demanding 1.30 days and the latter 144 da~·s' labor of skilled workmen. Theodolite No. 21., G-inch, constructed for this service in 1848 by Gambey, of Paris, had during the forty-nine years of excelle11t service become so badly worn and damaged as to be of only secoudary value. The centers of the instrument, as is almost invariably the case with tlle Gambey instruments, being of tlle finest workmanship of the time and made of the best material for tlle purpose, a11d still i11 excellent condition, it was considered best to design a new alidadc and telescope for the instrument and thoroughly recom·truct it, making all the upper portions of aluminum, thus making- it light enough to carry much greater telescopic power than before, and thereby much increasiug its capacity. The circle lrns been regraduated and new verniers attached. It is uow practically a 1iew instrument, and tlle design and proportions am so satisfactory that the di·awings a111l patterns will he of use in the reconstruction of several otllcrs of the same model, size, and approximaLe age.

Plans and specifications were made for the installment of a GOO-ton hydraulic press in the plate- printi11g rooms of tlte office. The constructiou of a tide-predictiug machine, for computing the annual title tables, has lwen continued when more important work would permit. About 775 parts of the nwchanism have been made during the y~ar. This will lie a very comprehensive machine and will do the work of thirty or more computers. The more modern gauges m;ed by this service were purchased from manufacturers of such apparatus. As their behavior at the regular long series stations was more or less unsatisfactory, it became necessary to improve them, making the changes i11 the instrnment shop by modifying existing and constructing additional attachment,.., the more important being the tidal division's automatic independent hour marker. This necessitated (]Uite au additional expense, and besides, though they worked fairly well, on account of their original form the alterations and additions caused the gauges to appear very awkward in design. The stock on hand being exhausted, it became necessary to procure more, and to obviate tlie foregoing obstacles a new and comprehensive design has been made covering all tlte requirements to date, and detailed working drawings aud patterns have been made, and seven of this new form of instrument are in process of construction in the shops. A set of three-arc photo-copying lamps, with proper rheostats and safoty connections, we1·e installed in the photographic rooms of tho office. 'l'he values in arc of fourteen astronomical aud geodetic levels were determined~ two of which were for the obsei·vatory of the University of California. 'l'wo aneroid barometers were adjusted aud carefully compared several times throughout their scales for the expeditiou :-;e11t to Mount St. Elias. The United States standard weights and measures exhibited at the Nashville Exposition were packed and forwarded for that purpose. Efforts have been made in various directiom; to incorporate labor-saving machines and appliances, which the shops are still in need of, and which could be economically used if there was sutlicient room. I have to call your attention to the very poor and trying liglit iu the instrument shop during clon<ly weather, which is not only an annoyance but retards progress, as it is impossible for workmen executing fine work to make desirable accuracy and dispatch uncler such unfavorable conditions. A det::tiled account of each day's work of each employee is kept on file in the division. It is with pleasure that I have to state that, with a single exception, which has already been removed, there is a hearty and conscientious interest of the employees of the division in their respective duties.

LIBRARY.

M:ore shelf room is nee<led for the library, and I repeat the recommendation made last year that the two rooms on the secoud floor, over those now occupied by the library, be titted up with shelving for the use of the library. If shelves l>e put np against the walls of these rooms, as in the "board room," they would not interfere with the use of the rooms for other purposes. During the fiscal year 123 volumes have l>een added to the library hy purchase and 352 volumes were obtained by exchange, etc. Many new scientific l>ooks recently published that l>ear upon the work of the Survey either directly or indirectly slwuld be added to the library in order to keep it up to date, and I would respectfully recommend that at least $1 000 be allotted to the library for the purpose of purchasing such books during the coming fiscal year. Our library is not keeping pace in growth with the lil>raries of other Government buream; which came into existence long after the Coast Survey was established, some of which contain several times as many volumes.

~o binding of original records and computations has been doue during the fiscal year just ended, as Mr. E. H. Courtenay could uot l>e spared from the computfog division to assist in preparing the volumes for the l>indery. There is a large amonnt of work in this line that ought to be done at the earliest possible moment. The hall-way rooms on the third and fourth floors of the" fireproof1' ought to be fitted up with cases and shelving to providB additional room for charts and to relieve the overcrowded back room on the fourth tloor of a portion of its contents. The following is a summary of original and duplicate records, computations, original sheets, etc., received and registered in the archives during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1897: Original observations, 642 volumes, 124 cahiers, 72 rolls, and 17:~ sheets; duplicate observations, 544 volumes, 110 cahiers, and 191 sheets; field computations, !l volumes, 88 eahiers, and 2 sheets; office compatations, 6 volumes and 86 cahiers; photography, 35 negatives, 34 lantern slides, 8 mounted prints, and 7 blue prints; log books, 70 volumes; specimens of sea bottom, 295 bottles; descriptive reports, topographic sheets, 4 cahiers; descriptive reports, hydrographic sheets, 10 cahiers; topographic sheets, 29; hydrographic sheets, 44.
FOlWE OF THE DIVISION.

Mr. Artemas Martin was employed as a clerk during the whole fiscal year, but he acted as chief of the division <luring the month of June, 1897. He had charge of registering all original and duplicate records, computations, and original t-0pogrnphic and hydrographic sheets, and of filing the originals in the archives; and answered calls for the same, and for books, and kept account thereof. He also registered the books received by the library, and bad charge of' the preparation of books and periodicals for binding, and of the preparation of monthly reports, and annual report, etc. Mr. Edward :F. J,ope11 was employed during the whole fiscal year. He has been occupied with the registering, listing, an<l filing of the maps and charts received, and in answering calls for the same; with the registering, filing, and listing of the serials and pamphlets received. He also answered ealls for books, periodicals, etc., and made out catalogue cards for new books, etc. Mr. Lopez has performed his various duties faithfully and efficiently.

The steamer Blake and party, nuder the command of Lieut. Commander A. Dunlap, U. S. N., Assistant, arrived at New York 011 ,July 4, 18!.W, an<l for the remainder of the month was engaged in completing the office work pertaining to the survey of Port Hoyal Sound entrance arnl in preparing for the resurvey of part of Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts. On July 31 the Blake left New York for New Bedford, Mass., arriving on August 2, but a week later previom; instructions were revoked and the vessel and party were ordered to complete the resurvey of the north shore of Massachusetts Bay. The Blake arrived at Gloucester on .A.ugnst 1~. Work was begun immediately and finbhed on Oct-Ober 31, 1896. The area covered during the season consists of that part of Massachusetts Bay lying along the north shore from Bastern Poi11t, entrance to Gloucester Ilarl>or, to Pickworth Poi11t, near Mauchester, and exte1Hling seawar1l for au average distance of 3 miles. 'l'he inshore hydrography, within a depth of 10 fathoms, is of exceedingly broken and dangerous character, numerous rocks and ledges extending in every direction. The survey was begun with a genera.I system of right angled intersection of lines 100 metres apart. A close development with double diagonal intersections was carried over many of the shoal spots. Offshore such additional lines were run over outlying banks only. The results from the survey have been highly ~atisfactory, and credit is due Lieutenant-Commander Dunlap and his party for the thorough 111a11111·r in which every detail relating to the work has been executed. Special care was exercised in locating every known danger and in developiug all other indications of shoals. In this way a number of ledges and rocks were found not heretofore known, and which \Vere at once introduced. on our charts. In this connection Lieutenant-Commander Dunlap reports that "the fishermen about J\fauchester, Magnolia, and Gloucester gave a great deal of assistance, and those from Magnolia often put themselves out in going along t-0 locate rocks, ledges: and shoals. No charge was ever made for services of this kind and I am indebted to them for much valued information." Lieutenant-Commander Dunlap greatly perfected the nomenclature of geographical points within bis working ground, and acknowledges the valuable information rendered by Hon. \Villiam II. 'l'appan, town surveyor of Manchester and president and historian of the Manchester Historical Society. On October 31 the tield work was concluded and the Blake proceeded to New York, arriving on November :J, after having stopped at )few Bedford to ol>tain a new whaleboat. On November 12 she left New York and arrived at Baltimore 011November15.

REPORT FOR 1897-PART I.

REPORT OF THE HYDROGHAPHIC INSPECTOR.

103

The resurvey of that portion of Chesapeake Bay in the vicinity of the approaches to Baltimore Harbor, from Sandy Point to Tolchester Beacll, had been assigned to this party. 'l'he necessary sig11als having· previously been erected and thefr positions located by J,ieut. B. H. Tillman, U. S. N., Assistant, commauding schooner Jlfatchle11s, tlle party on board the Blake began sounding work on November rn, 18!W. With several interruptions this has been carried on to the end of the fiscal year mid continues at the present time. 'l'he detailed instructions sent to the Blake require a close and careful survey, lines to be run 100 metres apart, crossed at right angles by another system of lines about the same distance apart. Pr~jections on scale of 1-10 000 were furnished for the purpose of developing closely the dredged channels leading to Baltimore Harbor, and also to enable a close examination of the Jumpy area at the mouth of the Patapsco H.iver. Later, and at a time when a complete scheme for the hydrographic resurvey of the whole of Chesapeake B:Ly had been pr~jected, the instructions nanwd were modified in so far as to allow the opening out of the distances between sounding lines to 200 and 300 metres in areas where a closer development was not considered necessary. Lieutenant-Commander Dunlap reports 'that at the end of .June, 1807, the party had rnn 828 miles of sotmding lines, aud covered 41 square nautic:1l miles of area. Owing to the wide expanse of the bay at this point, tlie low, unvarying aspect of the shore, and the almost ever.present mist on either one shore or the other, the work, especially in the boats, has been found to be of a trying chtU'acter. The bottom is for the greater part uneven and broken, causing a rough sea in even lL moderate wind. Notwithstanding these drawbacks the party has been indefatigable in pushingthe work, and there is good prospect of finishing it before the end of the season. The interruptions of the regular work, referre1l to, were caused by col<l weather, when repairs were made; the laying out of the Ohesapeake Bay speed trial course for torpedo boats, March 17 till April 24, 1897; aild attendance at the trial of the torpedo boat Foote, June 21to2G,1807. The trial course was laid out at the request of the Navy Department. The course as laid out is 241 uantical miles Jong and ext.ends from Point No Point to ,James Point. The south eud is marked by a range and by a first-class can buoy. From this point the course runs N. by W. 1 W. to a point 3·3;3 miles W. by N. from the tripod on .lames Point, also marked by a fii·st.class can buoy. From this buoy at tl..ie north end, S. by E. 1 E. ! nautical mile, is placed a second·class can buoy; 4·54 miles on tl1e course is a similar buoy, and thence every 4·74 miles it is marked in the ~mme manner, except at the end. The location of the trial course required the building of eleven large signals, cutting liues of sights and consequent amount of heavy work. Assistant D. B. Wainwright and Aid H,. B. Derickson had been ordered to cooperate in this work aud execute the nPcessary triangulation. Lieut. E. H. Tillman, U. S. N., Assistant, commamling schooner Matchles8, and his party were assigned for service in connection with the trial course and continued on this duty from :\larch :!2 to April 18, 18fl7. In relation to the wo1·k in Chesapeake Bay Lieutenant-Commander Dunlap makes note of the remarkable erosion of the shore line, especiaJly along the castem sho1 e. At a number of points large tracts of land have been swept away, and it is the general opinion among the inhabitants that the greater amount of this cutting away of the bluffs and beaches bas taken place within the past thirteen years. During the prosecution of the l1ydrograpbic survey the party (leveloped two new shoals, of which immeiliate reportR were made to the office for proper action. One shoal, of quite a large extent, was located 2~ miles E. ;\: N. of Front Light, Oraighill Channel Range, with least water of 7 feet owr it. The other shoal, with 6 foet on it, lies on edge of' channel off' Kent Island and opposite Sandy Point Light-House . .At the beginning of the fiscal year the steamer Bache and party, under the command of Lieut. R. G. Peck, U.S. N., Assistant, were at the navy-yard, New York, preparing for sea, and left that phwe on ,July 6, 18HO, for Long Island Sound, where au anchorage was made in the vicinity of Crane ~eek, Long Island. The work of overhauling, repairing, and repainting the naval speed trial course beacons, erected by thh; party in the summer of 18JG, wlis at once begun a11d prosecuted daily until finished .July 10. Upon the completion of the work on the beacons the Bache steamed to New London, Conn.,

UNITED STA TES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

for the purpose of obtaining from the lighthouse depot a buoy and sinker with which to mark the new position for the Nantucket South Shoal Light Vessel, wllich position, by request of the Light-Hom;e Board, Lieutenant Peck had been directed to determine after making an examination of the locality. New London was left iu the morning of July 11 and New Bedford, Mass., reached on the afternoon of the same day. On July 13 the Baehc left New Bedford for the purpose of making the required examination to the southward and westward of Phelps Bank for the new position of South Shoal Light Vessel. This duty was successfully completed by the lGth and the Bache returned to New Bedford. Report of the examination and the new position recommended tor the light vessel was made to you under date of July 28, 18H6. I may here state that this new position was adopted by the Light-House Board, and on October 17, 1896, the light vessel was successfully moved to the position recommended. For the season's hydrography that portion of Buzzards Bay, covering the south shore of the bay from the vicinity of Woods Hole to a point about a half-mile to the westward of Cuttyhunk Island, was assigned to the Baclw's party. A right angled development of the ground covered by the sheets was planned, the lines of each system being 100 metres apart. This distance was reduced to 50 metres in Cuttyhunk Harbor and in all the principal channels where it was considered that a closer development was desirable and important. Special developments were likewise made for all shoals and shoal spots, together with careful search for least water on known rocks and shoals. To secure absolute crossings of soundings, Lieutenant Peck made a very careful study of the tides of Buzzards Bay, for the details of which I beg to refer to the descriptive report accompanying the sheets. 'l'he season's work was completed in a systematic manner, and the high standard attained by tlH~ party has been maintained throughout. The weather havillg become unfavorable for further profitable hydrographic work with the last day of October, the Bache left New Bedford and ou November 1 arrived at the navy-yard, New York. Upon your recommendation, Lieutenant Peck has been designated by the Honorable the Secretary of War to make the survey of the Outer Bar at Brunswick, Ga., provided for by the river and harbor act of June 3, 1896. Lieutenant Peck was subsequently instructed, under date of November 30, 1896, to proceed with this survey in accordance with the terms of said act. He left New York on December rn in the execution of this duty and arrived at St. Simons Sound December 27, 1896, and began operations January 4, 1897. The field work of the survey was completed April lG, and on the 22d of the same month the Bache left Brunswick, Ga., for New York, where she arrived April 27, 1897. The time from this date to .June 22 was consumed in prosecutiug as rapidly as possible th~ office work of the survey. 'fhe necessity pf completing the i:Jheet on board required the plotting of 30 000 soundings (out of 39 000 that were taken), and the close and careful marking of contour lines made the preparation of the sheet a laborious operation. Lieutenant Peck's report of the survey, together with the sheet thereof and the original records pertaining thereto, l1ave been transmitted to the Honorable the Secretary of War. Copies of all the records and a tracing of the sounding lines run are retained in this office. This survey of St. Simons Outer Bar is one of the finest pieces ofhydrography ever accomplished in sueh an exposed locality, and reflects credit alike on the Survey at large and the party that achieved it. On July 1, 1897, Lieutenant Peck was relieved from duty on the Survey, having completetl a most successful tour of duty of four years and one month on this work, and ordered to duty at the :N" aval Academy, Annapolis, Md. The beginning of the fiscal year found the schooner Eagre and party, under the command of Lieut. G. 0. Hanus, U. S. N., Assistant, actively eng·aged i11 the resurvey of the northern part of Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, liaving ta.ken the field on April 21, 1896. Field work continued till late in the fall, when the Eagre returned to New Bedford. The unprecedented amount of work accomplished by this party speaks for itself. Nearly 2,800 miles of soundings, about 700 of which were obtained in pulling boats, is the record made. Four sheets were furnished the party. Of these, three sheets, including the head of the bay,

\Varebam, Onset, Buzzards Bay, Monument Beach, Pocasset, Marion, and Mattavoisett Harbor, were completed. An examination of the north shore and liead waters of Buzzards Bay will show that the bottom is b~oken aud irregular throughout. Iustcad of dewloping it in sect.ions and losing valuable time, Lieutenant Hanus decilh·d to treat the whole section as one grand shoal. The work is therefore nearly all of a very close development aud leaves no room for doubt anywhere. \Vhile engaged in the field work, and in conformity with your instructions, Lieutenant Hanus furnished Mr. E. L. Corthell, 0. E., with data for the proposed Cape Cod Canal. 'fhe Eagrc remained in New Bedford during the winter, and during the time that field work was prevented by cold weather the vessel, steam launches, and boats were overhauled and repaired. Pursuant to instructions, the Ea,yrc sailed from New Bedford on May 18, and, after s1)ending several days in building and cutting in signals, anchored in Marion on May 27, which place was chosen for headquarters on account of its facilities for obtaining coal a11d fresh water for the launches in which the work must be principally done. At the close of the fiscal year the season's work had well adva11ced, and over 500 miles of sou11dings bad been run, principally on the east side of the uay and in the vicinity of Cataumet Bay. It is my expectation that Lieutenant Hanus, in conjunction with auotlier party, will complete the resurvey of Buzzards Bay this season. Special credit is due to Lieutenant Hanus for the excellence of the work done by this party. His great experience, constaut supervision, and thoughtful consideration of every one co1rnected with the work, have given him an euviable standing as a surveyor and commanding officer. The steamer Endeavor, under the command of Lieut. W. S. Benson, U.S. N., Assistant, having left Baltimore, :Md., May 13, 1893, was at tlte beginning of the fiscal year engaged in continuing the resurvey in the vicinity of Montauk i~oint, New York. Work was begun on l\lay 2Cl, aud was continued until August 15, 189G, under Lieutenant Benson's command. After this date the work was conducted under the direction of Lieut. J ..J. Blandin, U. S. N., Assistant, who for several seasons previously bad served as executive officer of the Endca,vor. The resurvey was successfully finisbed 011 September 24. In addition to completing the regular systems of lines south of Block Island and Long Island, a:> provided in the instructions, the Endeavor's party was engaged in developing closely the shoal ground off Montauk Point, including Great Eastern Hock aud Montauk Shoal. A thorough i11vestigation of tlie latter shoal failed to show auything less than 5 fathoms. The bottom is hard sand, with no indication of rocks. A careful i11vestigatio11 of Great Eastern Hock showed a depth of 32 fathoms, instead of. 4 fathoms, as heretofore shown. A series of shoals or ridges, extending in a general east and west direction, in latitude 41 o OG 1 north, and from longitude 71° 47 1 west to longitude 71 o 51 1, were found and named "Endeavor Shoals." The ship's work of the previous season was connected to shore by traverses. The deep cut between Montauk Point and Block Island was further developed, and a set of specimens of bottom taken in it, as it is an excellent guide for entering Block Island Sound in thick weather, and of going clear of the shoals 011 each side of it at auy time. A number of current stat.ions were occupied, but the time was so short that it was impossible to secure full series of observations or to collect data that will be of more importauce tlia11 to show the necessity of more extended observations. , On account of the importance of the locality of this i:;urvey, both commercially aud strategically, the ofiice work was completed as rapidly as possiule and the results introduced 011 all charti;; affecteu. Special examinations in this locality were made off Brightmans Beach, Rhode Island; near uuoy No. 14, Fishers lslaud Sound; Greenport Harbor, Great Salt Pond, Block lslan<l, aud the breal{ off the 11ort.h end of Gardiners Island. On October 1, 1896, the Endeavor left New Loudon for Nantul'ket Sound to complete the resurvey of those waters. "\Vork was begun on October 3, au<l considerable difiiculty was experienced 011 account of the long distance from the siguals, the hazy weather, and high wiIHls. The 1>11rvey failed to show any indication of the 4-foot spots on Horseshoe Shoal, although a earefnl search was made and the ship was run over the shoals at all stages of the tide. 111 the same way ii number of other shoals, shown on the old survey, failed t~> realize.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

A complete survey was also made of 'l'arpaulin Cove. As the cove is used for an anchorage by a very large number of schooners, I have recommended that Lieutenant Blandin's survey be ntili;1,ed for a separate harbor chart of the locality. A project for the same ba8 l;>een submitted t-0 the chart board. 'fhe U. S. S. Dolphin having reported a rock near Sakonnet Point, H,hode Island, Lieutenant Bla11din was instructed to investigate. He reports the existence of a clump of bowlders with much deeper water around them. Sixteen feet is the least depth over them. This shoal was not knowu to the fishermen in this locality. This examillatio11 completed the Reason's work. The Endea1·or proceeded to New York, Ull(l after stopping at New London, ~cw Haven Breakwater, and Hempstead Harbor, arrived at the navy-yard on November 7. On the !Ith she started for Baltimore, Md., and arrived on the 11th, and prcparatio11s were then begun for the following season's work. On .January 14, 1897, the Endeavor sailed from Baltimore for Savannah, Ga., arriving there on ,January 21. From this time until April 29 the party under the charge of Lieutenant Blandin, was engaged in the resurvey off the mouth of the Savannah Hiver. The working ground extended from outside the bar to the mouth of the jetties and the shoals to the northward and southward of the channels. A rectangular system of lines about 200 metres apart was run over this area and this system crossed by one set of diagonals about the same distance apart. The soundings are very regular, changes being gradual except on the shoals, where there is a great irregularity. The survey also extended to the entrance of Calibogue Sound as far as Braddock Point. It is thought that the work just completed covers all the ground necessary for navigation. The party determined numerous changes in the shore line. No difficulty was experienced in doing this work except the great amount of stormy and foggy weather. As no Coast Survey bench marks are now in existence in this vicinity, Lieutenant Blandin leveled his tide gauge to a bench mark established by the Corps of Bngineers, United States Army, on Tybee Point. Capt. 0. l\'I. Carter, Corps of Engineers, U. S. A., in charge of river and harbor improvements around Savannah, fnrnisbed tile party with mucb valuable information concerning bench nmrks, records, etc. On l\Iay 4 the Endeavor returned to Baltimore, and on .June 18 J_,ieutenant Blandin was relieved by Lieut. Commander C. 'l'. Forse, U. S. N., assistant. Lieutenant Blandin 1iad been connected with the Survey and the party on board the Endeavor since O~_ber 21, 18U3, and has proved himself a most mipable and conscientious officer, whose work has been of the highest order. Lieutenant-Commander Forse enters upon a second tour of Survey duty, and from his previous record we have reason to congratulate ourselves in obtaining so able an officer. The Endeavor left Baltimore on ,June 28, 1807, for Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, where she will be engaged the entire summer. Ou his passage north Lieutenant-Commander Forse is instructed to take some <leep-sea soundings between Fenwick Islaml Shoal and Five Fathom Bank light vessel. The schooner llfatchless was placed in commission on July 3, 18U6, and Lieut. E. H. Tillman, U. S. ~., Assistant, assumed command on the same day. Upon taking command Lieuteuii.nt Tillman immediately proceeded to organize a party and fit out the vessel for hydrographic work, and on July W sailed for Norfolk, Va., arriving there on .July 2:~. Preparations were made to resurvey the w:iter front of the United States navy-yard. Signals having been located and the shore line run iu, the sounding work was llegu11 on August 11 and completed on August 25. Throughout the time the weather was so extremely hot tllat the party could endure exposure to the sun only a few hours each clay. Every effort was made to have the survey :wcurate and thorough, and this has been accomplished. Lieutenant Tillman reports that considerable troublP. was found in getting soundingH to cross closely, the <lepths being extremely irregular, 1lue to the dredging that has been done, and the bottom being sticky mud and the current not strong enough to level it off. From September 5 to October 23, 1896, the lllatchle.~s and party were engaged in transporting Assistant .J. B. Baylor, Coast and Geodetic Survey, and sncll material as he required, to tlie localities that lie designated, and furnishing him with the necessary misistauce in locating signals.

On October 27, 1896, the 1lfatchlcs.~ arrived at Baltimore, aud in accordance with your instmctions Lieutenant Tillman and party began the erection and locating of signals for 11ydrographic work in Chesapeake Hay, between San<ly Point and 'folchcster ~each. The work was completed on November 16 and the vessel prepared for systematic current observations in Chesapeake Bay. On account of cold an<l bad weather only a few ousc>rvations could be ma.de, and on December 13 the 1lfotcltlcss arrived at the vVashington Navy-Yard, '":here she remainecf until March 16, 1897. On March 13, 189i, a survey was made of the Washington Navy-Yard water front .. 'fhe work was immediately plotted and blue pr ints furnished the ~ avy Department and the commanda11 t of the yard. On l\Iarch 16 the 1lfatcltlc.~s saile<l for Chesapeake Bay, aud on March 22, off Point no Point, Lieutenant Tillman reported to tlw commanding ollicer of the Blake, Lieut. Commander A. Dunlap, U. S. N., for duty in connection with the laying off in Chesapeake Bay of a speed-trial course for torpedo boats. The party was engaged in building signals, etc., until April 18, when the Jllatcltles.~ sailed for Baltimore. Lieutenant Tillman established a self-registering· tide guage at Sparrows Point, and OH April 28 the Jfatcltlc.~.~ was anchored off North Point and began hourly observations for currents, which were continued until May 7. On May 17 the schooner occupied a position 3~ miles east (true) of Seven Foot Knoll Light. Observations began at noon of that day and continued until 8 p. m. June 16. On ,J unc 22, 18fl7, Lieutenant Tillman anchored the Jlintchless in the channel about nine-tenths of a mile east by south from Sandy Point J,ight and began a month's current observations at that station.

The steamer Pa.ttcrson, Lieut.. Commander K K. l\foore, U. S. N., Assistant, commanding, having undergone extensive repairs, was received from the contractors on May 23, 1896, and a trial trip was made on ,Tune 18. The officers and crew were moved on board on the 20th, and the party fitted out for the season's work as rapidly as possible. This was completed early in July, and on the 14th the Superintendent, accompanied by Lieut. H. Hodma11, U. S. N., joined the party at Seattle, vVash., for the purpose of observing the topography through which the boundary between Alaska and British Columbia passes and to inspect the nature of the Pa.ttc1·son's work, the manner of doing it, and determine as to its accuracy. 'fhe Patterson sailed from Seattle 011 July 14, and on the 19th arrived nt Port Simps011. From this day to August 2 the Pa.tterson touched at various points in southeast Alaska, including Yakutat Bay, arriving at Sitka on the afternoon of the latter date, thus completing the Superintendent's inspection of the boundary line and general features of the country. After taking on coal, launching the Cosmos, fitting her and other boats for work, and locating an uncharted slioal in Sitka Sound, the Patter.~on left Sitka on August 7 and anchored in Haley Anchorage, Fh1h Bay, the same day. The season;s work began immediatelJ', the Superintendent accompanying the various parties in the field, for the purpose of inspecting the manner of doing the work, until SPptember 23, when he took 11assage on the mail steamer for Seattle. The primary triangulation was carried down through Peril Strait, across Salisbury Sound, through Neva Strait, across Nakwasina Passage, and through Olga Strait, terminating at Dog Point, on Lisianski Island, and the northern one of the Siginaka Islamls, where the last signals were well marked. Also through Salisbury Sound to the sea, where signals were well marked. The secondary or sextant triangulation was carried from the primary at Neva and Olga poi11ts t-0 the southward and westward through Krestof 1:3ound to its ,iunction with Sitka Som1d, and into Nakwasina ·Passage from the same 1wints to the eastward, about three.fourths of th(I distance to its junction with the same sound at Dog Poi11t, leaving these two areas unconnected. Tho shore line and hydrograpily were completed as far as the triangulatioll i11 all cases. The topography is finished in Fish Bay and through Peril Strait to its junction with Salisbury Sound, and most of that 011 the north side of the sound is done also. 'fhe manner of doing the work was the same as that of the 11rnvious season, with 11erhaps a

108

little more refinement in the triangulation in narrow places. The chairnels through which the season's work passed are narrower, more intricate, more filled with rocks, islands, etc., than those of the previous season, but the general features are those of all southeast .Alaska-high and rugged hills, thickly wooded and covered with underbrush, with bold water in most cases up to the cliffs, and no beach, making it especially difficult to locate triangulation points. 'fhe bydrogra.phy and shore line were more difticult for the same reason, aud in addition some of these channels were cut up with islands and rocks, requiring greater car~ and closer developments. Particular attention was given to the observation of tides'; gauges were established at Bunter Bay, Pogibshi Point, Haley .Anchorage, and at Sitka. Simultaneous observations were taken at Pogibshi Point, on one side of Sergious Narrows, and Haley Anchorage on the other, and at Sitka. Pogibshi showed such a great divergeuee from the other two that Lieutenant-Commander :;\1oore recommended further· iuvestigatiou, which is being prosecuted during the present season
( 1897).

Current observations were taken at the Southern H.apids, Sergius Narrows, for practically one lunation, and showed a great irregularity in the time of' slack water which was unknown to the pilots before. Lieutenant-Commander Moore's recommendation for further observations or currents in this locality is also being carried out at the present time. The results of the season's work are embodied in six: topographic sheets, covering 37·5 square miles, and 1 897 miles of shore line; five hydrographic sheets, covering 71 square miles of water and 504 miles of soundings run; 22 current stations were occupied. The triangulation embraced the measurement of one base line, the erection of ;1()7 signals, aud the occupatiou of 533 stations for horizontal angles. Seventy-one stations were occupied for vertical measures to determine 92 elevations. Lieutenant-Commander Moore again calls attention to the courtesy shown the party by the Pacific Coast Steamship Company, aud especially by Captain Wallace of the Oity <~f Topelca, who carried mail and marketing from Puget Sound and stopped at any place where he found the Patterson, to deliver mail or stores. On October 9, 1896, the Patter.~on left Sitka for San Francisco. On the evening of the same day the party located a rock off Point Caution, iu Whitewater Bay Entrance. 011 October 10 the shoal in the north entrance of 'Vrangell Strait, where the Topeka struck in 18H5, was successfully located. At the same time a party was sent to develop the reporteu slwal on which the steamer Alki struck in 1896. This shoal was fouud to have no existence, but the mud flat on the east side 11ow cxteucls farther into the channel, and the indications are that the channel bas changed. On October 13 the Pattcr.~on got uncler way again, and after stopping in Clover Passage to search for an island; at Departure Bay, British Columbia, to fill with water and coal; and at Victoria, Briti8h Columbia, arrived at Sau Francisco ou tho 23d of October, 1896. 'l'lle I'atterson was nuder repairs, receiving· a new upper deck, etc., from November 16, 1896, to January 18, 1897, during which time the officers and crew were quartered on shore, but there was no iuterruption to the oflice work. In this connection Lieutenant-Commander Moore desires to call special attention to the courtesies received from Lieut. Commander Frank Courtis, U. S. N., light-house inspector, who allowed him the use of the light-house wharf and storehouse on Yerba Buena lslanu for the storage of the equipment, etc., of the Patterson. After refitting, etc., the Patterson, on April 3, 1897, sailed for southeast .Alaska, and on October !.I arrived at the Puget Sound Naval Station, Bremerton, Wash., having toucltecl at Port 'l'ownseud and Seattle en route. Lieutenant-Commander Moore made an inspection of' the Hassler, .Earnest, and Fuco. The Ifassler was removed and overhauled, and the Patterson returned to Seattle to obtain 10 000 feet of lumber to fit out the two parties that were to occupy tllc tide a11d current stations at ~eymour and Sergius Narrows. On April 1:~ the IIydrographic Inspector arrived from the East ancl came on board to make the trip for tl 1e purpose of inspecting the coast of southeast Alaska, the work done, that to be done, and the manner of doing it. The Patttrson left Seattle 011 April I:.$, and after stopping at Victoria and Departure Bay, British Columbia, 011 April Hi a11cltored in Plumper Bay, Seymour Narrows.

REPORT OF THE HYDROGHAPHIC INSPECTOLC

10~

After inspecting the Narrows, Lieutenant-Commander l\foore decided to place the tide gauge and current station on the east side to the northward of Maude Islaud Passage. 'fhe party set up a tido staff, erected a frame house 12 qy 13 feet with two rooms, and establishell Second-class Fireman Charles Nelson in charge, with Seaman Nils Olin as his assistant, with stores and supplies for six months, to observe tides and currents until the return of the ship in October. Specific instructions as to the frequency and manner of observations were given. On April rn the Patter.~on proceeded north after touching at various places, and stopped in Bear Bay, near Sergius Narrows. After inspecting the rapids the west side between Shoal aud Sergius points was decided on to be the best place fort.he tide anll current station. The same preparations as were made in Seymour Narrows were carried out at this station, and Scaman J. Beurman was left in charge, with Seaman Fred Gail as assistant, and given the same instructions as the party at Maude Island Passage. On April 30 the Patterson arrived at Sitka and commenced tidal observations on .Taponski wharf, occupied the previous season, thus forming a chain from Victoria, British Colnmuia, to Sitka, Alaska. After an inspection of the various branches of the field work, the Hydrographic Inspector left the Patte1·son on May G and returned to ¥Va.shington. The season's work began .May 1 and has continued the entire season. It began on the north side of Sitka Sound, where it was left off last season, continued down the Sound aud connected with the work of the Patterson of 1893, thus completing the inside steamer route from the British Columbia line in Dixon's Entrance to Sitka, with all the arms, bays, and bights connected therewith. 'fhe pitrty also took up the work off the mouth of Salisbury Sound, where it was left off the previous season, and carried it about 15 miles. to the northward and westward, off the coast of Chichagoff Isfand; and the survey to the south ward on the sea side of Kruzoff Island is well advanced, insuring the completiou of this work this season, and connecting- Sitka Sonn<l with Salisbury Sound, outside as well as inside. The hydrography is carried out to the mo.fathom curve and Lieutenant-Commander Moore mentions that it deepens more gradually outside than inside, except off the month of Sitka Sound, where there is a deep hole dropping from 70 fathoms to 500 fatlioms in about 2 miles, 8 miles from Cape Brlgecnmbe; off Salisbury Sonud and to the northward and westward the 100-fathom curve is from 12 to 15 miles off shore, and the coast is very treacherous. There are outlying sunken rocks and reefs, some as far as 3 miles offshore. The general features of the inside waters aucl shores are the same as described heretofore. At the close oft he fiscal year the party had so far accomplished a remarkable amount of work, which is worthy of detailed statement, viz: One base line had been measured. Three hundred and eleven signals had IJeen erected. Two hundred and eighty-fivo stations had been occupied for horizontal augles. Sixty-nine stations had been occupied for verticaJ angles. Ninety-seven square miles of topogTaphy 11nd been covered. One hundred and fifty-one miles of shore line had beeu run in. Two hy<lrographic sheets were finished, comprising 73G miles of soundin~s. I desire to call your attention to tlie improvement of the Alaska work which has been brought about under the immediate direction of Lieutenant-Commander Moore. His unfailing good judgment of everything connected with the work, the party, and the ship under his command, has furnished the Survey with results that deserve special words of commendation. l regret in this conuection that the reports of Lieutenant-Commander )foore have not been made available to the general public, and would recommend that the publication of future reports be made a matter of early consideration. The steamer Ocdnc.11 and party continued throughout the year under the command of Lieut. Commander A. P. Osborn, -U. S. N., Assistant, and on July 18, 18!lG, resumed the survey of that portion of San Francisco Bay known as San Pablo Bay, where the work was steadily continued until November 17, when the vessel proceeded to Oakland Creek for repairs. On December 7, 1896, repairs having been completed, the Gedney proceeded to Sausalito to await the arrival of Rear-Admiral J. G. Walker, U.S.)[,, chairman of tlie board to locate a !leep-

water harbor iu southern California. On December 19, in compliance with your instructions, the Gedney sailed to San Pedro, C~tl., where, under the direction of the hoard, the party made hydrographic examinations of San Pedro and Santa l\Iouica hays, and also of the inner harbor of Sau Pedro. On February 7, 18!l7, having tiuished the work for the board, the Gedney returued to Sau Francisco and resumed work in San Pablo Bay. On May 11, 18H7, the regular hydrographic work was discontiuued in order to lay out a uew 1-mile speed-trial course. On ,June 15 the Honorable the Secretary of the Treasury placed the Gednev at tbc disposal of Dr. D.S. Jordan, president of the Leland Stanford University, for tbc purpose of an investigation of the seal rookeries on the island of Guadalupe, on the uortbwest coast of Mexico. The Gedney, with a party of scientists from Leland Stanford Cuiversity, left San Francisco on June 15, arriving at l'IIelpomene Cove, Guadalupe Island, ou June 21. From June 21 to .July 1, 1897, both ship and launch were engaged in carrying tbe naturalists to various points of the island and renderiug them such assistance as they required in securing and preserving specimens. During the stay at Guadalupe Island tbe latitude of a point 011 the south cud of the island was determined by observations to be 2so 50' 30" north. Hesults of observations on the north end led Lieutenaut-Uommander Osborn to believe that the latitude and longitude given ou British Admiralty chart No. Hl3u is correct. Having only one chronometer the party made no attempt to establish a close longitude. The two latitudes make the length of the island about 20 miles. During the \'arious trips about the island a running survey was made. A chart, of excellent execution, with data and method of work, has been received and upon your instruction forwarded to the Hydrographer, Kavy Department, for use in tbe correction of charts issued hy that office. · On July 1 the Gedney left Guadalupe Island for Sausalito, Cal., arriving on July 7, 1897. The resurvey of San Pablo Bay, conducted by the party nuder tbe command of LieutenantCommander Osborn, is now nearly completed, and at the close of the fiscal year 24 squarn miles liad been covered by over 900 miles of soundings run. 'fhe work executed for the board to locate a deep-water harbor in southern California resulted in three hydrographic sheets of Sau Pedro Harbor and approaches, on various scales, and one hydrographic sbeet of Santa Monica Bay, scale 1-10 000, and covers altogetller ~~3 square miles. The steamer 1lfc.:Lrtltur was throughout tlie year engaged in the resurvey of Sau Francisco Ray, awl part of the time in further development of Bonita Channel and Golden Gate. Lieut. James JI. Sears, l~. S. :N., Assistant, remained in comma11d until .April 4, 1897, when he was relieved by Lieut .·J. l\f. Helm, U. S. N., Assistant. The finished sheets of this party comprise the entrance to Sau Francisco Bay and that part of the bay from tlle northern part of Sau Francisco and Alcatraz Island, on the west side, to Oakland and West Barclay 011 the east side of tbe bay. The limits of the entrance sbeet extend from outside the Heads, in a line extending between Franks Lagoon on the northwest and Cliff House on the southeast, to Fort Point 011 the inside. It includes the important Bo11ita, or North Channel, the Golden Gate, and Mile Hock Channel. The difficulties in the bydrography were fouud in the irregular and strong currents, the lack of good ranges, the prevalent fogs, the high winds, aud the tidal seas. No <lifliculty was met in the matter of siguals. Throughout the area the bottom was found to be very irregular, both in depth and cbaracter. Eve1·y suspicions discrepancy in the soundings has been investigated, and it is believed that every feature bas been completely covered. Lieuteuant Sears discovered and fully located a number of dangerous rocks, of which immediate report ~tud publication was made. The most important ones are Sears lfock, 18 feet, and Centissima Rock, 27 feet, in the fairway of Bouita Channel; the 10-foot rock, entrance to Hodeo Cove, and the Hi-foot rock in the middle of Mile Hock Channel. A number of pinnacle rocks were located off Tennessee Cove, and north of it, and also near Point Bonita and Fort Point. Altogether over two dozen new rocks were located. For the first time the inshore hydrography was fully developed. The descriptive report accompanying the entrance sheet is very comprehensive aud contains much valuable information, especially in regard to currents.

The sheet covering part of the uay, as described auove, iucludt>s Blossom Hock, the shore of Yerba Buena Island, the channel to the eastward, and the Berkeley Flats. 'l'he difficulties encounkrc<l were mainly those of weather, halle, and smoke. 'l'he currents were found to ue extremely peculiar, and were observed to be running in opposite directions ou either side of Ycrha Buena Islaud at the same time, with varying strength. · 'l'he changes in hy1lrography, as sl10wn by comparison with the published chart, appear to have been slight. Little change was noted in the 12 and 18 foot curves, but considerable change was found in the location of the G-foot curve lying off the Berkeley shore, due without doubt to the intluence of the extensive piers of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company. Lieutenant Sears had practically completed this part of the work, including the descriptive report accompanying the sheet, when Lieutenant Helm relieved him. Since the middle of April the ilfcArthur's party ha!'. been engaged in the hydrograpby of the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay, between Thompsons Landing and Potrero Point. 'l'hc party has also selected and located a large number of ranges i11 and about San Francisco, for use in determining compass deviations. 'l'hese ranges will be put to a practical test, and it is the intention to put the morn important and useful ones on the charts affected. 'fhe total work of the fiscal year covered 27~ square nautical miles and represents 7flG miles of souu<lings run and 56 518 soundings taken. 'flte present commanding officer of the Mc1lrthur, Lieut. J. M. Helm, U. S. X., is now serving his second tour 011 the Survey. As commanding officer of the same vessel a11d of the Gedney he has made an enviable reputation in this office.

calling your attention to the constant efforts of the officers in charge to improve the hydrographic features of the charts. The oflice force has given entire satisfaction and the recommendation for increased compensation for Mr. E. B. Wyvill and Mr.·J. T. \Vatkins is strongly urged.
COAS'.1' PIL0'.1' P AU.TY.

This party has been kept busily engaged in the continued correction and compilation of the Coast Pilot publications. Lieut. G. 'l'arbox, U.S. N., Assistant, remained in charge until bis detachment .June 15, 1897, and carried on the work with zeal and with a constant effort to improve the work. Be was ably assisted by l\:lr. John Hoss. Since June 19, tile party has been in charge of Lieut.·J. U. Gillmore, U.S. N. 'l'he main work of the party ha.s been the preparation of manuscript for the first edition of the Coast Pilot, Part VIII, of the Gulf of Mexico, with supplement to other parts, the details of which are meutioned in the report annexed. It is hoped that the publication of ranges on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts may prove of use to mariners to enable them to find the deviation of their compasses with little loss of time. The present force of the coast pilot party is too small for the work and an additional nautical expert for the Alaska work is urgently needed.
ltEPAiltS AND l\IAIN'.l'ENANCI<; OF VESSELS.

Total expenditure, $3 989·96. Stea.mer Pattcrson.-The extensive repairs begun during the previous fiscal year on this vessel were finished during the present. The upper deck, with all its planking, beams, carlings, coamings, skylights, pilot house, booby hatches, deck clamp, inside bulwarks, etc., were removed and replaced with new, using best Oregon pine. Everyt.hing was replaced as it was before, except that 11 additional beams were put ini more evenly spaced, the beams molded 5 inches amidships and tapered to 4 inches at the ends, instead of 4 inches all through, and sided 7 and 8 inches, instead of 6, 7, and 8 inches. The knees were fastened with through bolts and nuts, instead of drift bolts, all making the deck much stiffer and Rtronger. The fire-room batch was made of three-sixteenths boiler steel instead of wood. The cabin-booby batch waR raised 15 inches, so as to enter without pushing the slide. The two gangway boobys were raised :!4 inches. The pilot house was lengthened about 9 feet, extending from the fore hatch to the fire-room ventilators, over the old drafting-rooJ?'.l skylight, which was decked over, making it 20 feet long by 9l2 feet wide on deck. A drafting room was made in the after end lOf:;- feet long by 8F:1 feet wide inside. The leaders for the wheel rope were changed to lignum-vitro, fair leaders for the wire rope, and piping for manila, making a more direct lead and the wheel ropes al ways taut. A layer of heavy . hair felt was put under the canvas. The starboard fire.room ventilator was renewed and the upper part of the port one renewed, while the lower part was repaired· both were lengthened to clear the top of the pilot house. A bulkhead was run through the middle of the old drafting room and the starboard side converted into a library and sick bay 11-Ar feet long by 6-?:r feet wide, while the port side was turned into a room for the two leading machinists and dispensary, the latter opening into the sick bay. The mizzenmast partners, tile deck about them, and sides of beams next to them were found to be rotten. The beams were graved and partners and deck renewed. The

The scroll work, name, globe, and stars were reg'ilded. A new fore yard, mizzen topmast, and main boom, and new main and mizzen crosstrees were supplied. The bulkheads and coamings of the main-deck hatch house were repaired. The main deck wus calked from the ward-room bulkhead forward. The upper and lowei· seams of the outside bulwarks were calked. The paint was burned off between decks forward, and the whole ship painted. The coal-bunker bulkheads were repaired around the bottom, where they had rotted away. 'l'he standing and ruuniug rigging were all overlmuled. Steam launches and boats were thoroughly overhauled and repaired, and a flat-bottom skiff supplied. Boilers and engine overhauled and repaired; also pumps, pipes, and secondary engines. Lagging on upper part of main boiler was cov~red with galvanized iron under the hatch to protect it from the weather. Total expenditure, $7 016·75. Such repairs as tended to their preservation were made to the Spy, Transit, Hassler, Cosmos, the laui1ch Fuca, and other launches.

REPORT OF 'l'HE HYDROGl{Al'HIC INSPECTOR.

117

'fhe present form of appropriation, giving a few hundred or a few thousand dollars for this section and another allotment for ·another section of the coast, does 11ot brinJ the same results frolll the expenditure of the money as if the appropriations for the hydrographic work were made in one sum. The hydrographic surveys and resurveys of the extensive coast of the United States, including Alaska, will never be finished. 'l'he repairs and outfits and other expenses of the vessels must be maintained throughout the fiscal year, and all should be lumped in one appropriation to obtain the best results. Un<lee the present form of appropriation in many cases work of importanc(I in one section of a coast is dropped, to be continued at additional expense at some future day, because there is 110 money to lmy possibly 50 tons or less of coal. In every other respect the vessel may be fitted out to continue the work, but the lack of a few hundred dollars makes it imperative to send the vessel to another section where the appropriation may be available, or, if too late in the season, the vessel may be laid up or refit when she could work advantageously. · The can for a sur\·ey of the mouths of the Yukon River is growing imperative. Tile unusual character of the work makes it necessary that a vessel especially built for this purpose be available, and that many unusual expenses, such as extra pay, subsistence, food, winter quarters, dogs, sleds, etc., be provided. If the survey of the mouths of the Yukon is to be begun this spring, an appropriation of $100 000, to be immediately avaiJable, should be matle by January. If the appropriation is not available at once, little or no work will be done on the Yukon during 1898. 'l'he growiug importance of Alaska, tile large number of lives and the great amount of property that are carried through Alaskan waters, seem to warrant immediate action. Lieut. Commander H. G. 0. Colb,y, U.S. N., was relieved as Hydrographic Inspector by Hent. Commander E. D. Taussig, U.S. N., Oil December 2:~, 18UG. The Hydrographic Inspector has endeavored to inspect all the vessels on the working ground, with a view of securing more uniform work and to enaule him to recommend with greater intern. gcuce the allotments for repairs and party expenses. All hydrographic parties were found engaged zealously in prosecuting the work assigned them. It is recommended that tile classification of the clerk assigned to the Hydrographic Inspector uc advanced, as the duties require a knowledge of the forms of both the Treasury and Navy Departments. Mr. ,T. H. l{oeth has during the past year, as heretofore, performed these duties to the satisfaction of tile Hydrographic Inspector. The reports of the ciliefs of the hydrographic and coast pilot divisions are herewith forwarded. Very respectfully, E. D. 'l'At:SSIG, .lAeutenant·Oommandcr, r. S.

Besides the above a large amount of miscellaneous work has been done, including revision and verification of proofs, charts, and drawings; tracings and projections made and verified; tidal data reduced and plotted; comparisons of hydrography and topography, and other work. The monthly Notices to Mariners have been kept up an<l promptly published. It gives me great pleasure to substantiate the report of the previous fiscal year as to the zeal and efficiency of all employees of this division, and it is owing to this zeal and efficiency that the division has kept the work up to date. The force employed in the division during the year has been composed of Messrs. W. 0. Willenbucher, F. C. Donn, and ,J. T. Watkins, draftsmen, and Mr. E. H. Wyvill, chart corrector. Mr. Willenbucher, as chief draftsman of the division, has very great and varied duties, all being performed with promptness, accuracy, and ability. Mr. Donn and Mr. Watkins 11ave executed the work falling to them with efficiency and faithfulness. The position Mr. Wyvill fills calls for great skill as a draftsman, knowledge of nautical and navigational matters, and chart making and its precedents, both in and out of the office, knowledge of the methods employed in the different kinds of work in the field, and great care and vigilance. Only long experience and constant application could enable.one to do the work of the office as he has performed it. He deserves great praise, and, what is more practical, more pay. As hi;;; duties are more important than those falling to the other correctors in the office, I would earnestly recommend that a special rating, as recommended in the last report, carrying with it commensurate pay, be created for him, or if this can not be done, that he be promoted to the first vacant clerkship. For the same reasons as given in last report, I would earnestly urge that the salary of Mr. Watkins be increased to $1 200. Very respectfully, .T. c. GILLMORE, Lieutenant, U. S. N., Chief of Hydrographic Division. Lieut. Commander E. D. TAUSSIG, U.S. N., Hydrographic In.<lpector, Coast and Geodetic Sun:ey.

REPORT OF THE COAST PILOT PARTY FOR THE Ii'ISCAL YEAR BNDING JU:N'E 30, 1897. SURVEY, WaRhington, D. C., June 30, 18.97. Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report of the coast pilot party for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897: Under the general direction of the Superintendent and the supervision of the Tlydrographw Inspector, the duties of this party involve the execution of work in the field and in the office. At the beginning of the fiscal year the party was engaged in the preparation of manuscript for the first edition of United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VIII, Gulf of Mexico from Key West to the Hio Grande. This consisted mainly of incorporating the information obtained in the field between February 1 and May 21, 1897, with that obtained by correspondence and from other sources. While engaged in this work it was found that an edition of 1 000 copies of a supplement to the Coast Pilot, containing the Rules of the Hoad at Sea, etc., had been exhausted, and the manuscript for a second edition of this supplement, with some additions, was prepared and sent to the printer. An edition of 500 copies was printed, this number being sufficient to supply the demand uefore the new Rules of the Road go mto effect.

On December 9, 1896, the manuscript for Coast Pilot, Part VIII, was sent to the printer, and ·the work of preparing supplements, containing all the important changes in Coasts Pilots, Parts IV and V, since the date of their publication, was begun. From December 21, 1896, to February 6, 1897, the party was engaged reading proof for Coast Pilot, Part VIII, and for supplements to Parts IV and V. On April 2 Part VIII was ready for issue, having been in the printer's hands three and one-fourth months. This shows that there is no real cause why a volume of the Coast Pilot should remain iu the printer's hands nine months, and even longer, which has been the case with some of the previous volumes, the record being fourteen and one-half months. Since February 6 much of the material for a second edition of United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VI, Chesapeake Bay and Tributaries, has been collected, and while waiting an opportunity to verify the material and collect later information i11 the field the manuscript for a supplement to include the more important changes which have taken place since the publication of the first edition of this volume (1889) has been prepared and sent to the printer. The manuscript for a supplement, containing the new Rules of the Hoad, has also been prepared and sent to the printer. . The office having arranged to establish ranges on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the l7 nitell States by which mariners may find the deviations of their compasses, the coast pilot party has been charged with tbe selection and establishment of the ranges, when possible, and their publication after their magnetic bearings have been determined. The usual routine work of the party, keeping detailed records of all changes, reported dangers, hydrographic examinations, new information available, and other data which may be used in the compilation or correction of Coast Pilot volmnes, requires considerable time and constant attention. In the general scheme for a Coast Pilot for the .Atlantic Coast, formulated by Lieut. G. 1-l. Peters, U. S. N., in 1896 and developed during the years 188G-1888, with the approval of the Hydrographic Inspector and of the Superintendent, the coast was laid off in parts, as was thought most convenient for the mariner, and with the design of eventually incorporating the several parts (abridged, if necessary) in one volume. This plan has been followed, so that the eight parts which are now issued, and which cover the Atlantic Coast of the United States from the St. Croix River to the Rio Grande, are all alike in construction and scope of subject-matter. Since 1893 all volumes of the linited States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, issued from this office have been corrected to date of issue, for all important changes that have taken place since their publication and which affect the text. Owing to the constantly increasing demand (about 850 volumes in 189G, and which has reached 654 volumes during the six months ending June 30, 1897), the work of keeping the volumes corrected requires much time and labor. It has been found that after a volume has been in print four years the corrections become so numerous, due to changes in hydrography, topography, and aids to navigation, that the volume loses both in appearance and usefulness. To partly overcome this, editions.of 600 copies are now printed, but some of the first parts issued (notably Part VI, published in 1889, and of which more than 1 500 copies were printed) ha,·e now so many corrections, that for purposes of navigation their usefulness is much impaired; the general information, however, is st.ill of value to a stranger. With regard to the combination of aU parts in one volume, I would say that past experience has shown that this part of the original scheme has become impracticable, on account of the later decision to keep the volumes corrected to date. With the volumes now in print as a guide, it is safe to say that two years after a Coast Pilot of the Atlantic Coast in one volume was printed, there would be 35 to 40 pages of closely typewritten matte1·, or a supplement of 25 to 30 pages, to be inserted as corrections. In view of the above, I think it unadvisable to combine the parts as long as they are to be kept corrected to date. The value of a Coast Pilot depends upon its accuracy, and the latter depends on the information contained being up to date. To maintain the standard of the Coast Pilot for accuracy, it is necessary to verify all information already collected, whatever its source, and to gather additional information (that can be gotten only in this way) in the field. 'rhe compilation of a new edition of any volume without its verification in the field would detract g-reatly from the usefulness of the work. R.espectfully, GLENNIE TARBOX, Lieutenant, U. 8. N., Chief of Coast Pilot Pm·ty. Lieut.-Commander E. D. TAUSSIG, U. S. N., Hydrographic Inspect01·, Coast and Geodet-ic Suri·ey.

OFFICE REPORT NO.

REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE OF 'l'Hg OFFICE OF STANDARD WEIGHTS AND MEASUHES FOl{. THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.
UNI'.l'ED S·.rATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY, OFFICE OF STANDARD WEIGIITS AND MEASURES,

Washington, ]), C., June 30, 11:197. SIR: I have the honor to report that during the fiscal year just closed the usual amount of work has been accomplished in the Office of Standard Weights and Measures and prompt attention has been given to the numerous calls for information. The, usual operations of verification and adjustment of weights, capacity measures, staudardR of length, thermometers, alcoholometers, salinometers, etc., for departments of the Government, the several States, institutions of learning, engineers and surveyors, manufacturers and private parties, have been carried on, and the results, considering the small force of the office, have been quite satisfactory. Some progress has been made, also, in the preparation for the construction and verification of electrical standards, but a point has now been reached where an increase in the instrumental outfit of the office is imperatively demanded, and I earnestly recommf,nd tbat in the estimates to be submitted t-0 Congress in December the item "for purchase of materials and apparatus and for incidental expenses" be increased to $2 500, the usual appropriation of $500 being now entirely inadequate. This increase ueed not necessarily be continuous, but if made even for a single year, will enable us to procure instmments which are indispensable. Tue work of the year has been of the usual character, and almost altogether of the routine order, so that none of the operations require special mention or description of methods, with the exception, perhaps, of the determination of the coefficients of expansion of 6-metre standard bar No. 2 and 6-metre base bars Nos. 3 and 4, and the determination of the values of the metric subdivisions of the Mural standard. The former operation was performed in the vault, and by means of the 6-metre comparator, the necessary range of temperature being obtained by the use of ice and hot water alternately. The standard bar was packed in melting ice, while the base bars Nos. 3 and 4 were immersed in hot water, and vice versa, and sufficient time was allowed to elapse between and after changes to insure t.he attainment by the bars of the thermic conditions indicated by the thermometers. These determinations were made by me, with the assistance of Assistant R B. Latham, who was temporarily detailed to the Office of Standard Weights and :Measures for the purpose. The determination of the values of the metric subdivisions of tlie Mural standard was made by Assistant E. B. Latham, under my direction, by means of an optical beam compass consisting of two micrometer microscopes securely mounted in a wooden beam, which was supported by three screws. These screws furnished a reacly means of making the focal adjustments. AU the metres of the Mural standard were determined in terms of the sixteenth metre, which was arbitrarily chosen as a tentative standard, and the actual values were subsequently readily deduced, as the total length of the Mural standard was already know11. In observing, the optical beam compass was first adjusted over the chosen tentative standard metre and three readings of the micrometers were recorded; then the beam compass was similarly adjusted over any other metre and three readings of each micrometer were taken; then, returning to the tentative standard, the observations thereon were repeated. Temveratures in each case were noted and the two sets of observations on the tentative standard were combined and compared with those taken on the

OFFICE OF STANDARD WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.

other metre under examination. This· process wa.<1 repeated until all the individual metres of the .Mural standard had been compared a sufficient number of times and their values determine1l in terms of the sixteenth metre. Five standard thermometers were used during the work, one being continuously on the tentative standard and the other four on the four metres to be next examined. On completing the observations on any metre its thermometer was immediately moved four metres ahead, so that ample time was in all cases allowed for the thermometer to adapt itself to the temperature of the new position before being again observed. The thermometers were always in actual contact with the Mural bar and the bulbs were protected by metallic shields. While there· doubtless may be some uncertainty as to actual temperatures of the bar, yet, as the observations on each metre were immediately preceded and followed by observations on the tentative standard, the relative temperatures cannot be materially in error. The results of the comparison proved very satisfactory. No change in the personnel of the office occurred during the year. Messrs. L.A. Fischer and C. A. Harbaugh have, as heretofore, efficiently performed the various duties assigned to them, the former serving throughout the year, and the latter until June 15, when be resigned to accept a, more lucrative position in another department. Mr. Fischer also prepared the exhibit of this office for the Nashville Exposition and installed it there early in May. Mr. Otto Storm, mecbanician, was detailed throughout the year to the instrument division. Mr. W.R. Whitman, mechanician of the instrument division, served in the Office of Standard Weights and Measures during July and August, 1896, and part of March, 1897, and was engaged principally upon the adjustment of weights and measures belonging to the State of Massachusetts, but rendered valuable service also on miscellaneous work. Mr. R. B. Crutchfield was engaged on miscellaneous duties until March 15, when, his services being no longer required, he was assigned to other employment in the office of the Survey. The temporary detail of Assistant E. B. Latham to the Office of Weights and Measures has already been referred to. Before closing this report I beg to refer again to the valuable services of Mr. L.A. Fischer, and to renew my recommendation that provision be made in the annual estimates for an increase of his compensation: Accompanying this report is an abstract of verifications, determinations, and standardizations made during the year for other departments and for outside parties. Yours. respectfully,
ANDUEW BJiAID,

APPENDIX NO. I-1897.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE MAGNETIC DIP AND THE MAGNETIO INTENSITY IN THE UNITED STATES, FOR THE EPOCH JANUARY 1, 1900.
[Second edition with three charts.]

By CHAULES A. ScHO'IT, .Assistant. Submitted for publica.tion May 20, 1897.

Introduction.-During the past eleven years, since the publication of the first edition of the paper 1 on the secular variation and geographical distribution of the magnetic dip and intensity in the United. States, many records of observations have accumulated, particularly in localities not hitherto visited by observers, and our former extremely meager information respecting the annual change of the dip and of the intensity bas given place to a somewha.t better understanding of the changes now going on in the distribution of the direction and intensity of the magnetic force within our boundaries. The need of a new edition of the paper was thus indicated. The intensities are now expressed in O. G. S. units; this system was introduced on the Survey in 1882, but in preparing the last edition of the distribution of the intensities (horizontal and total component) the older English units 2 were still adhered to as it was then found more convenient for the collection, coordination, and discussion of the older observations. This state of things no longer exists. Collection and tabulation of observed dips and ·intensities.-In the present table I have brought together the results at all stations where either the dip or the intensity or both have been observed, but at every place only the most recent results have been admitted. For special reference to locality or source from which information has been obtained, see the first edition (App. 6, Rep. 1885); stations not contained in that collection have been since added, and particulars are on rncord in the Survey Office. The political subdivisions (by States), and the order of arrangement of stations by increaRing latitudes a.re the same as in the first edition and in conformity with . the paper on the "Distribution of the magnetic declination in the United States, etc.," 3 which makes it quite easy to identify or compare any station contained in that paper and in the present collection. The density of distribution of dip and intensity stittions is, like that of declination, extremely it-regular, !J-S may be seen from the following table giving the number of stations in each State orotber geographic division:

Arrangement of the table.-It contains the observed values as well as the corresponding values for the epoch 1900·0, whenever means were available for reduction to that common epoch; if this could not be effected it is indicated by a blank space to be filled in hereafter when an adequate knowledge of the secular variation shall have been acquired. The first column gives the name 1 of the place, in italics when a secular variation station, the second and third the coordinates of position which have been put in accord with tl1e best or latest information in our possession; they are given to the nearest whole minute of arc, an accuracy quite sufficient for our purpose. The longitudes count (positive) from Greenwich westward to 180°; when counted eastward, which is the case for a few stations, the letter E is attached. The columns headed e, H, F require no explanation. The values in the next two columns 11 1900 and H, 000 are derived from the preceding corresponding values by application of the effect of the secular change for the number of years between 1900 and the year of observation. The annual variations are taken directly from the discussion contained in .Appendix No. l, Report for 1895. In case of a secular variation station the latest observed values are set down but the referred values for January, 1900, were taken from the analytical expression whenever established in the above appendix. In presenting the values for the year 1900 it is felt and understood that they are necessarily weak and may in some instances appear stretched as to extension in time, since most of. the secular change expressions involve but the first power of the (elapsed) time. We can not insure the fourth place of decimals in the values of H, V, and F for 1900, and it is only carried in order to secure the third place figureR. To wait until the reduction to epoch 1900 could be accurately effected for all our observations would be to defeat the object for which this paper has been prepared and would deprive us for many years of useful information. The values of V.ooo and F 1000 were computed from the corresponding values of 81 900 and H1000· The last column of the table contains the observer's name and will serve for reforence to particulars either as given in .Appendix No. G, Report for 1885, or, in case of a later date, in the record of the observation on file at the office of the Survey. Construction of the isornagnetic charts of the United States for the epoch January 1, 1900.-The three isomagnetic charts accompanying this paper show for the common epoch January 1, moo, aud within the compact area of the United States, the distribution of the dip or isoclinic chart and of the intensity or isodynamic charts for the horizontal component and the total force. The scale of th~se charts is the same ao used for the isogonic curves and the same as in the first or 1885

edition, viz, The vertical force component has not been charted, as it is of less impor7 000 000 tance. The respective values of O, H, and P for 1900, as given in the taule, were plotted on the large scale base maps and the curves ot' equal values were constructed graphically. For the plotting of the respective values I am indebted to Mr. F. W. Clay of the computing division. The isoclinic chart contains, besides the curves of equal dip for intervals of 20, a central region or belt where for the period 1890-1900 the annual change is either zero or very small. On the 1885 chart a similar belt of no annual change was shown much in the same position as now, but any actual shift of the position within the last ten or fifteen years is still masked by the uncertain position it had at the earlier date. A first attempt has also been made to introduce curves of equal annual change (for the epoch 1900), lines for-3',-2',-l', 0',+1',+2', and +3' being given. Their positions, however, are still more or less doubtful or conjectural, yet they will serve for redu~ing the dip to any other than the epochal year within a certain small number of years. Tlte first isodynamic chart exhibits the distribution of the horizontal component of the magnetic force. It depends on the tabular values of H 1900, and the curves of equal value were constructed graphically, their common difference being 0·020 of a dyne. To facilitate the reduction of any graphical value to another epoch, withing the limit of a few years, there is likewise shown a belted area of little or no annual change during 1890-1900 and several dotted curves indicating the ammal increase or decrease of the horizontal intensity, as the case may be. Compared with the region of no change shown on the 1885 chart, the present position is considerably tm the iiorth of it but the location at the earlier date is very uncertain. The position of the curves of equal auuual chnnge is given for the first time, but this part of the representation is necessarily weak. The second isodynamic chart gives the distribution of the total magnetic force within the compact limits of the United States; it is based upon the tabular values of F 1y 00 and was constructed in the same manner as the preceding chart. It was thought unnecessary to present with this paper also a chart of Vl9:J0 , or of the distribution of the vertical force, since this component can readily be deduced for any locality from the data given. It is to be hoped that at the time new magnetic charts become desirable our knowledge of the secular variation of{} and Hwill have so far advanced as not only to give greatly increased precision to the results for the new epoch, but to include among its values many of the observations which could not be brought forward to the epoch of the present paper. For the effective study of the local deflections of the magnetic force, in direction and intensity, at places of irregular distribution, our data are far from being sufficient to make the attempt of the analysis at this date profitable.
Collection of the most recent magnet-io dips and intensities ob8erved in the United States and referred to the epoch 1.900·0.

APPENDIX NO. 2-1897.
THE TELEGRAPHIC LONGITUDE NE'l' OF THE UNITED S'l'ATES CONNECTION WITH THAT OF EUROPE, 1866-1896. AND ITS

Report by C. A. Sc110TT, ABBi,ta11t.

Introductioh.-The gradual extension of the telegraphic longitude system may be said to have kept pace with the progress made in the development of the facilities of the country. Thus in the yeai· 1884*' the part sufficiently completed for adjustment had Omaha, Nebr., for its western limit, while at the present time the Pacific Coast is well supplied with longitude stations. Broadly speaking, there are tllree lines of wire connections across the country from ocean to ocean-one near the northern boundary, one centrally located, and one near the southern boundary. Tliese lines are connected by ties involving intermediate stations, the whole forming what is well designated as a t£'-legraphic longitude net. It will be the business of the computer to properly disperse in the results the small individual discrepancies which make tlleir appearance in all fallible measures when confronted with the inherent mathematical conditions. In each of the years 1866, 1870, and 1872 direct cable and wire connections were secured between Cambridge, Mass., and Greenwich, England. These three trans-Atlantic determinations for longitude, taking their start from the adopted initial meridian, proved to be ·in good accord t yet a fourth determination was desired in order to impart additional strength to this link of the prospective belting of the globe, mainly because the observers had not interchanged places during these operations so as to directly eliminate their personal equation. This fourth determination was opportunely supplied in 1892 + when Canadian and English observers connected Montreal, Canada, and Greenwich with all desired accuracy. If we examine any of the charts in the later annual reports of the Survey designed to illustrate the longitude results, we shall find more than two lmndred determinations. These serve various purposes, such as furnishing the longitudes to tlle triangulations in all parts of the country, supplying similar information for special localities, such, for instance, as capitols of States and astronomic observatories, in order to improve their geographic Jlositions-these observations also include the longitudinal subdivisions of the arc of the parallel in latitude 39°bnt the main object for t}leir existence was the evolution of a standard longitude net of n limited nnml>er of selected stations in order to give consistency and accuracy to all longitudes of surveys connected with this standard system.§ It is with the publication of the individual results and
·An earlier preliminary adjustment involved only coast stations us far as Now Orleans (Rop. for 1880, App. No. 6). t Appendix: No. 11, Const Survey Report for 188.J., pp. 429, 430. t The definite result has not yet been published (July, 1897), but was in part supplied through the kindness of Prof. C. H. :McLeod, of McGill University, Montreal. 11 \Vhen the shores of the Atlantic had boon united by the electric c1ible, the exchange of western and eastern times proved that the longitude hitherto adopted in tho survey of our oastern coast, which rested upon moon culminations, eclipses, transits, occultations, and, last of all, on ehronometer transportations, was considerably in error. In 1851 the aclopted longitude of Harvard College Observatory, Cambridge, Mass., which served ns the standard value, was 4 11 44m 29··50 (see Coast Survey Hoport for 1851, p. 480; there is u misprint which makes the seconds 29.05), but tho first cable determination gave the value 4" 4.J.m 30··85, and later the adjusted value from three determinations ~ucle it 4 11 44"" 30'·99 (Report for 1884, p. 428). In con.;eqnenco, in April, 186!l, tho longitudes of the Survey on this coast were inorcaBecl 1··35 or 20"·25, which in this latitude is not far from a third of a statute mile. A similur increase of Jougitmles, or pushing westward of the coast lino as represented on the older ehartH, was found necessary on our Pacific Con.st, only thero tho amount of chungo was greater; from tho earlier rcsultH of moon culminations th<i goollet.ic longitude of Telogruph Hill at San Francisco wns taken us 8 11 O!J"' 33'"::!!J; a report nmlle by the writer in !'llureh, 185:), gave the resulting Jougitudll 8h 0!1 111 3.1··37 depending on 20u moon-culminations obst'rved at

the adjustment of the differences of longitude between the stations which compose this system that this paper is alone concerned. Historical note.-It is not the intention, nor would it be the proper place, to introduce here any extended account of the history of the telegraphic longitude method from its inception to its present highly developed state, but, as in the previous publications of 1880 and 1884, a short notice of the development of the method while in. the bands of the Coast (and Geodetic) Survey is both desirable and necessary for the proper understanding of the results and their probable errors reached at differeut epochs since 1845. When, in May, 1844, Morse flashed bis first telegraphic messages over the wires between Washington and Baltimore, with a transmission time of his sig11als so short as to be barely perceptible, it is not to be wondered at that this time-annihilating device was sufficiently suggestive to the mind of an astronomer to foreshadow a new method for determining differences of longitude by its means. 'l'he first notice by the Coast Survey pointi11g to such use I find in the Report for 1846, page 32, and in Appendix No. 11, page 72, where the instructions issued in the autumn of 1845 by Supt. A. D. Bache to Assistant S. C. Walker relative to the determinatlon of geographic longitudes by means of the electric telegraph are given. In consequence of these instructions arrangement~ were made in the summer of 1846 to connect Washington with Jersey City (opposite New York) via Philadelphia, and on October 10 and 22, 1846, signals passed between the United States Naval Observatory at Washington and the Central High School Observatory at Philadelphia. The observers were Prof: S. C. Walker and Lieuts. M. F. Maury and J. ,J. Almy at the first place and Prof. E. 0. Kendall at the second place. This was simply experimental, but in July and August, 1847, more complete apparatus having been procured the experiments were renewed with different observers at the terminals. The work was one of cooperation between the Superintendent of the Naval Observatory, Lieutenant l\faury, and the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, Dr. Bache, while to Professor Walker was left tlJe charge of the arrangement of tlJc details of the operations. Professor Walker was connected with both governmental institutions between tbe years 1845 40 and 18!7, and in his letter of November 10, 1847, inclosed in a communication by Dr. Bache of February 7, l848, to the Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 632, we have given the most complete notice of the theory and practical value of the 11ew method. Further information as to the state of the work is given in a second letter by Dr. Bache, in the Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 666, dated December 26, 1848. Under date of January 3, 1849, the Secretary of the Treasury communicated to the House of Representativest a report from the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, setting forth and describing the new telegraphic method for the determination of longitudes. This report incloses two detailed statements by Assistant 'Valker, dated December 15, 1848. In these early days much attention was given to the determinations of wave and armature time and the personal equations, while to the mechanical details of automatic registration a11d to clock break-circuit devices, as well as to the purely astronomical part of' the operation, due attention was paid. For this and kindred matter the annual reports may be consulted. A more popular accou11t of the new method given by Walker about this time will be found in Littell's Living Age, Vol. XV, Boston, October, 1847. This article is copied from the Washington newspaper Union. On the part of the United States Naval Observatory see Washington Astronomical Ob~ervatiuns During the Year 1846, Vol. II, 1851, Appendix page [5J, where Lieutenant Maury, in a letter to Dr. Locke, dated January 5, 184!), gh·es credit for the suggestion of using the electric telegraph for longitude determination to Captain W,.ilkes, U. S. N. 'l'his was on tbe occasion of the opening of the Baltimore line in 18!4. See also Washington Astronomical and Meteorological Observations of 1871, Appendix IV, "Memoir of the founding and progress of the United States Naval Observatory" by Prof. J. E. Nourse, U. S. N.
seven different places an<l reduced to tho 11tation by means of chronometer transportations; but in the spring of 1869 San Francisco and Cambri<lge were directly connectOll by wire with a resulting difference of longitude 3 11 25"' 07··37 which when referred to Telegraph Hill makes its longitude 8h 09"' 37··46, or 122° 24' 21"·95, which oxcoe<ls the 1855 result by 3''1 nearly, or a.bout 46''·5, which in the latitude of San Francisco amounts to almost three-quarters of a mile; thus the country was considerably wider than had been known before the advent of the telegrnphic method. ·Possibly even as early a8 1844.

After the retirement' of l~rofessor Walker, in.1852, Dr. B. A. Gould, Assistant in the Survey, was called upon by the Superintendent to take charge of the longitude work, which remained fo his able hands till 1867, when he tenderetl his resignation. 1.'he progress made duriug this interval may be read in the respective annual reports of the Survey, but his most important contribution is contained in the Report for 1867, Appendix No. 6, pages 57-133, "On the Jongitude between America and Europe from signals through the Atlantic cable." The peculiarities of cable work are here set forth in great detai1, and Dr. Gould also contrasts the older astronomic with the new telegraphic result.* Assistant George W. Dean succeeded Dr. Gould, and under the immediate direction of the Superintendent bad charge of the longitudes between 1867 and l 874, but after the expiration of the last-natned year no special appointment for conducting this work was made, doubtless, as it was felt that it had then become in a great measure one of mere routine. The results heretofore obtained were found to lack consistency of treatment, and in September, 1878, the computing division of the Survey was directed to take charge of the computations and submit reports in connection with the devulopment of the scheme. As a first fruit we have giveu in Appendix No. 6, Heport for 1880, a summary of re::;ults of 80 determinations between principal statiom; and of 4 7 subordinate ones, which is followed by an adjustment (method of least squares) of the longitudes of 25 stations connected by 34 determinations of ditforences of longitude between them.t Present field an<l office pi-actice.-A full exposition of the method of longitude determinations, as practiced about the year 1880, will be found in Appendix No. 14 of the report for thitt year. Part II of tlJat paper is illustrated with two plates showing arrangement of the several telegraph instruments and their connections, also of the c)lronograph by I!'auth & Co. Since tlJat time the sending of chronometer signals and the galvanometer tests of the circuits has been discontinued, thus considerably simplifying the exchange of signals without detriment to the accuracy of the chronometer comparison. About three dozen arbitrary break signals, sent and received, at each station, constitute an exchange during wl1icb the chronographs are run at double speed. The whole time required is but a few ml.notes. The method followed both in the tield and in the olfice or by the observer and computer, and the one in use substantially at the present time, is described and illustrated in two appendices in the annual report for 188!J, viz, No. 8, "Telegraphic determination of the longitude of a station on Mount Hamilwn, California, etc., and No. !:l, "Description of two new portable transit instruments for longitude work." These instruments were constructed at the Survey Office by E. G. Fischer, chief mechaniciau, from designs by Assistant Edwin Smith. Tlw more modern work depends entirely on these excellent iu::;trnments. The establishment of a strong longitude net embracing the whole country was ::;te:Hlil~· kept in view. . The longitude net.-The general plan of the composition of the net and its connection with the initial longitude station in Europe have already been referred to above. In the i:;election of the links only those were admitted in the scheme in which the personal equation had been eliminated through the i11terch1inge of places of the observers. There are a few exceptions to this, in wliich cases, however, the personal equation was ascertained by direct or indirect comparisons. A few, but important, links were introduced which rest on other than coast and geodetic authority, viz, the connection Oambridge and Detroit, by the United States Lake Survey; the connection Cambridge and l\fontreal, by the respective directors of the observatories, and the new cable connection of the Montreal and Greenwich observatories. The links and meshes of the net are shown on the accompanying map (scale, 1-10 000 000). Key West, Fla., was introduced to provide for Central and South American cable con:1ections; Galveston and El Paso, l'ex., to connect with Mexican lines and cabl1·s to the west coasts of Oentral and South America, while any future Pacific cables are within easy reach of the system. The net contains 45 stations with 72 links; with this were after\Vltrds connected 3 secondary stations with 4 links. Abstracts of res1Llts.-In what follows the individual nightly values for difference of lougitude between any two stations are presented, together with the resulting weighted mean result and its ~robable error; also other pertinent information respecting dates, observers, instruments, trans*Of the two cub le longitudes sulisequont to that of 18u6 11 full aoconnt la given by Assh1tnnt J.

mission time, description of stations, reference marks, etc. The abstracts are given in tabular form and are sufficiently self-explanatory. In accordance with general regulations two cornputatlons of each longitude determination are made; one by the observer, the other by the office computer under the direction of the chief of the computiug division. .All longitude computations since 1893 were made by Mr. D. L. Hazard, of this division, who !las also reviewed or revised the older office reductions. As has been shown in .Appendix No. S, l{.eport for 1889, the combination weights p, assigned to the values of L1 A. of a longitude determination, depend in the first place on the p1 obable errors of the two sets of time determinations at each station;" next on the resulting probable errors of the chronometer corrections at the time of exchanges; and lastly on tlte combination of the latter values as found at the two stations. The difference between the indiscriminate and the weighted mean is small, generally less than O··Ol. The places of stars are taken from the Berlin .Tahrbuch and supplemented by the American Ephemeris and Nautical .Almanac, but corrected when indicated by the time observations. In the abstracts the personal equations are set down as tltey are needed or given by the longitude results themselves before mid after interchange of observers. To obtain their equatorial values they would have to be multiplied by the cosines of the stars' declinations. No attempt is here rna1le toward a discussion of personal equations beyond the tabular collection of certain comparative results; nor is there any discussion of the time of transmission or of wave, armature, and relay time, for the reason that in most cases precise data are wanting, such as material, size and length of line wire, and presence or absence of repeaters. The abstracts of the differences of longitudes are presented in chronologic order, and of the two stations of each measure the western one is always named first, and since west longitudes are taken as positive, the differences of longitudes are all of positive sign.

. . *Both the Const Survey Report for 1872, 11. 229, and tho Const Survey Report for 1874, p. 177, give "west," but the computation and reduction, p. 230 of the first-named report, and the rcco1·d us corrected by Assistant Hilgnrd show it to have been "east." For result see Coast aud Geodetic Survey Report for 1884, p. 413. t At tho time of writing tho difference of longitude between these observatories has not yet been definitely ascertained, chiefly on account of tho persistent difference of the values by the ~nglish and French obsen·ers. There nre several direct o.nd indirect results on record; thus oigbt values given in the monthly notices of tho Royal Astronomical Society, January, 1891, vnry between tho limits gm 2()1·g2 and gm 21"·09 (the value of 1854 being omitted), whereas tho values of the English and French observers in 1888 were gm 208·85 and gm 21··04, and again in 1892, gm 2()1·84 nnd 9 111 21··05, raspectively. In the adjustment of the European longitude not b;v van de Snndc Bakhuyzon (Astronomiscbe Nacbrichton, No. 8202, October, 1893) two reductions are made-one with the introduction of the value gm 20··83, the other with gm 21··03; the corresponding ll{\jnsted values were gm 20··93 and g·u 21"00. In my adjustment of tlw American s~·stem of 1884 the rosnlt WUR gm 20'·9fi. Iu view of these circumstances, there is no reason why the above 1872 value should not be introd11ce1l with advantage in the present adjustment.

DIFFERE~CE

OF LONGI'fUDE BWl'WEEN ).10NTREAL, CANAllA, AND GREENWICH, ENGLAXD, VIA CA!\80, NOYA SCOTIA, AND WATERVILLE, IRELAND.

Executed by Prof. C. H. )lcLeod, of McGill liuivcrsity, und :\Ir. H. H. Turner, of the Uroouwich observatory:

Of this important addition to the longitude Rystem of Xorth America only a preliminary account has as yet been published, t giving the preliminary results:
h. m..
1.

~

Montroal to Canso 0 49 37·4 } CanMo to Waterville 3 24 32·0 Total 411 54"' Waterville to Greenwich 0 40 09·3

From a reply by Professor McLeod dated May 15, 1897, to an inquiry about the longitude work, it would appear that a considerable time must yet elapse before the final results could be had in print, and since it was undesirable to hold back the computations and publication of the present report, this omce has availed itself of the final result kindly communicated by Professor l\foLeod,t viz: 41i 54 111 18'·Ci7. The probable error of this result, however, could not be given; it has, therefore, been estimated, for which see reduction further 011.
·Tho following let tor was rocoi vod after tho report had been completed; the difference in tho estimu ted probable error (± 0'·03) a.nd that assigned hy tho observer (::!: {)8·015) will not materially nffoct tho resulting longitudes. McGILT. C0Luw1c 011sERVAT01tY, Jlontreal, August 2, .1897. DEAH Sm: Heforring to your letter of April 26, lo.st.-The probable error of our trans-Atlantic longitude determination, which dopends on twelve nights at Groenwich aud Mon4'oal, will not excee1l 0'·016. The rntmlt, 4" 54m 18··67, is not in any way dependent upon tho intermerliato stations. Tho longitude of the station at Wnterville, Ireland, is 40'" 41··305±0··013, aud tho longitude of Huzol Hill, Nova Scotia, is 411 O·l'" 07··30±0··05. The latter depends on a somewhat incomplete series of observations for one-half of tho work, the weather havin~ been bad at tho cable stations during the early part of tho work. Yours very truly, C. l l. lllcL1w1>. W. \V. Dun·rnLD, Esq., S1tpe.1·fote11dent United States CoaJ1t and Ge"'letiv Sun,ey.

It will be both instructive and useful to exhibit and evaluate the variation in the personal equation from a series of measures between practiced ouservers and extending over a number of years. In this field of inquiry the survey offers several excellent examples taken from the present collection of re~mlts, and supplemented by intermediate results })ertaining to 1inks not included in the general longitude net. No accou11t is here taken of the different declinations of the stars.

EFFECT OF THE VARIATION IN LATI'l'UDE UPON THE RESULTING DIPFERENCES OF LONGI'l'UDE.

The correction to an observed difference of longitude ou account of the variation in latitude and the consequent periodic shifting of the direction of the meridian is in general very small. Only the difference of the effect at the two terminal stations will enter, besides the longitude links are short and their latitude difference generally small and the latitudes themselves comparatively low, all of which tends to keep the correction small. It is fair to assume that it is within the limits of the probable errors of observation; even in au extreme case as in the cable determination of 1892, Greenwich to Montreal (say about 1892·78)· when the two poles were widely separated, the correction was not far from -0'·01. Considering that the coordinates of the moving pole are themselves still subject to considerable uncertainty aud improvement and that the whole effect on the longitude system is to some extent compensatory, for both the annual and the fourteen mouths periods, it was thought that the application of so small and uncertain a correction was not called for at the present time.
ADJUSTMENT OF '.1.'lIE LONGl'.l'UDE NET CONNECTING GREENWI011 7 ENGLAND, AND SAN FRANCISCO, CAL.

The preceding abstracts of results show that 45 longitude stat.ions are bound together by 72 determinations of difference of longitude; there are, therefore, 28 more measures than absolutely required, henc'e they involve that number of conditions which must be satisfied in order to form a consistent whole. Although the method of treatment presents no novelty, it was thought advantageous to recapitulate briefly the leading formulm in order that the notation and numerical work given further on may not require additional explanation. With regard to weights to be given to the individual differences of longitude, the fact that in every measure there exists a certain limit of accuracy, beyond which the probable error of the operation can not be depressed, no matter how often we may repeat the measure, has been kept in view. Any resulting numerical value of the probable error less than this adopted minimum limit may be regarded as more or less fictitious; of such values, that is less than supposed ::!: O··OOS, there are in our table 17 cases, of the whole number 72; these have each received the maximum weight, notwithstanding their range from

Comparing the resulting longitudes of stations common to the two adjustments (that of 1884 a partial one and that of 1897 complete), we notice a small (about 0"·08) but general increase in the longitudes. This is mainly due to the introduction of the fourth transatlantic determination, of 1892, which exceeds the older values by fully o··t, a-o,d has a comparatively small probable error assigned to it. While our results are greatly improved, we can not but look upon the oldest (in 1866) direct connection with Greenwich as rather out of date respecting its large probable error. This is at once apparent by the fact that we have but 2 determinations of L1i\. between Foilhommerum and Greenwich, and but 3, with a fourth rejected, between Calais and Heart's Conteut,

and both links without interchange of place of observers. This being the weakest link in the chain, a patching up of the old line or an additional determination through oue of the uewer cables should receive further consideration. The smallness of the corrections to the land lines is quite gratifying. The average correction to the 72 observed longitudinal differences is (without regard to sign) 0"·0!!0, with a maximum correction of 0··069, which falls alike upon the two weak links above referred to.

The mean error of an observation of unit weight is given hy m1 =

[p.'l:v] is found by means of the individual corrections and checked by the relation [rvv] = - [wO].

To find the weight and probable error of the adjusted value of an observation, also the weight

the former normal equations and changing at the same time the former correlates into the new undetermined quantities R 1, ~' R3 ···· , the requirement of the conditioned minimum leads to the following so-called transfer equations:

+ [u.ab] ~ + [u.ac] R3 + +

Solving, we have the values of R 1 and, consequently, also of F 1 by the relations

Applying these formulre to the present discussion, it will be found sufficient to compute the probable errors for two extreme positions only~ say for Washington, D. 0., aud San Francisco, Cal., since the small difference in these values will permit a ready estimate, by inspection, of the probable error for any intermediate place.

lt will be seen from these results that we are justified in assigning to any of our American longitude results a probable error.of about::!: 0'·052, equivalent to::!: 0"·78, which, in latitude 3!)0, represents a linear extension of but 18·8 metres, or 61·7 feet nearly. Compared with the probable error deduced for Washington in the discussion of 1884 the present value is o··007 larger, which is evidently to be ascribed to the greater diversity in the cable results. Even this small probable error of::!: 0'·05 could, if desired, be further diminished either by re-observing the two weak links or by introducing a new cable determination, as already mentioned .
.TUNOTION OF THE NOR'fH .A.MEltWAN AND EUROPEAN SYSTEMS OF LONGITUDE.

At present the connection of these systems is still somewhat eml;>arrassed by the unsettled state of the question, "what is the most probable difference of longitude between Greenwich and Paris'/" The determinations of 1888 and 1892 by the English observers agree and give 9m 20'·84 nearly, while the corresponding French determinations also agree among themselves, but give 9m 21"·05 nearly. The difference of 0'·2 remains as yet unexplained. In the last adjustment of the Buropean or eastern longitude net in the Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 3202, October, 1893, vie, "Rcsultats d'une compensation du reseau des longitudes, determinees dupuh~ 1860 en Rurope, en Algerie et en quelques stationR en Asie, par 11. G. vnn de
Sande Bakhuyzen," the author evades the issue by making two independent adjustments-once

with the English (adjusted 9m 20'·930) and then with the French value (adjusted 0 01 21'·001).· The result from the measure of the American party in August and September, 1872, was 9 111 21"·000 ± 0··038, the correction to this value by the present adjustment is - o··032, hence the resulting difference nm 20'·968, which is so close to the average of the E11gli~h and French values as to indicate but a small preference for the latter one.·
ADDITIONAL PROll1INEN'.l' LONGITUDE STATIONS.

There are two stations, though not forming part of the preceding adjustment, yet from their importance of position and astrouomical work, and in view of their direct connection with the Coast and Geodetic Survey system of longitude, must be included in this discussion. They are the United States ~aval Observatory at its uew site in VVashington, D. C., northwest, and the Lick Observatory, on Mount Hamilton, California.. 'rhe old and new location of the former were directly connected on eleven nights in March and April, 1~93, by observers attached to the observatory. fo June and July, 1896, the Coast and Geodetic Survey established a new longitude statio11 in the grounds about the office, near and south of the Capitol in Washington, and in l\fay and June, 1897, made the connections between it and both the old and new sites of the Naval Observatory. The abstracts of the individual results for difference of longitude are herewith presented. l~espect ing the second station there is only one but direct conne~tion with our longitude station at San Francisco; it was made in October and November, 1888, by a Coast and Geodetic Survey party. The abstract of the results is appended. vVe also give.here the connection with our system in Septernuer, 1886, of the United States Engineers' observatory at Ogden, Utah, on account of its prominence in the determinations of geographic positions west of the one hundredth meridiau.t · This observatory was erected in 1873, but has been abandoned for many years. It is directly connected with the Salt Lake station, as shown by the abstract of results. The value adopted by the United States Engineers was 71i 27m 59'·643. This refors to the east pier in the western room. '.l.'he 1011gitude work done by the United StateR Lake Survey 1lepends on the longitude of the observatory at Detroit, Mich.t It was built in 1871 and connected with the Coast and Geodetic Survey station of 1891. The longitude of this observatory, east pier, adopted by the U11ite1l States Lake Survey was 5 11 32 12··'.!4 ± 0'·08.

APPENDIX NO. 3.-1897.

RESULTING LONGITUDES OF KADIAK, UNALASKA AND UNGA, ALASKA, AS DETEI~.MINED CHRONOMETRIOAIJLY FROM SITKA IN 1806, BY THE PARTY UNDER THE CHARGE OF FHEMONT MORSE, ASSISTAN'l'.

Heport by CHARLES A. ScHO'l"I', Assistant.

OFFICE OF THE CoAS'l' AND GEODE'l'IC SURVEY, Co:MJ>U'l'ING DIVISION,

Washington, D. C., April 6, 1897. SIR: I have the honor to submit herewith a report on the resulting longitudes of Kadia1c, of Unalaska and of Unga, Alaska, as determined chronometrically from Sitka, Alaska, between April and August, 1896, Assistant F. l\forse in charge of the work. At Sitka Mr. Morse observed for time at the astronomic station of 1892, in front of the Presbyterian church. Instruments: Meridian telescope No. 1Ci and sidereal chronometer Hutton, 194; mean time chronometer Bliss, No. 2821, aud sidereal chronometer Negus, No. 1825, were kept rated at the station by means of comparisons with observing chronometer. At Kadiak Assistant H. P. Hitter observed for time at a station about 500" ruetres north of the Alaska Commercial Company's wharf aud distant about two kilometres southwesterly :from the old astronomic station of 1867. Instruments: Meridian telescope No. 1 and sidereal chronometer Frodsham, No. 3462; the chronometers sidereal Negus, No.1769, and mean times Fletcher, No.1713, and Hutton, No. 208, were kept rated by means of comparisons. At Unalaska Mr. 0. B. French observed for time at a station near the center of the t-0wn of Unalaska and about one-third of a mile east of the end of the spit. The new station was connected with the old one on Amaknak Island, approximately. Instruments: Meridian telescope No. 9 and sidereal chronometer Negus, No. 1771; the chronometers mean time Dent, No. 2167, and Fletcher, No. 1507, and sidereal Negus, No. 1824 were kept rated by means of comparisons. At Unga Island, one of the Shumagin group, Mr. French, during a short stop of the mail steamer Dora, observed for local time by meaus of a sextant and artificial horizon, and by comparison with the rated chronometers on board deterruiued the longitude of Unga. On board the Dora Assistaut F. A. Youug had charge of the 21 chronometers, which were compared daily. Four round trips were made between Sitka and Unalaska, with stoppage on the way at the intermediate station, Kadiak. The general arrangement of the longitude work was similar to that of recent years in Alaska, and the method of reduction, and in particular that of giving weights to individual chronometers and individual trips, is the same as that followed heretofore and explained in detail in A11pendix No. 3, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1894. The following tabular results, therefore, will requi~e no further explanation. The office computation

UNITED ST.A.TES COAST .AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

was made by Mr. D. L. Hazard, who compared his results, as far as practicable, with the rougher field computations:

IrnSULTING HEIGH'fS FROM SPIRIT LEVELING BETWEEN HOLLIDAY AND SALINA, KANS. FROM OBSBH,V ATIONS BY I. WINSTON,· ASSIS'l'ANT, BETWEEN JULY 11 AND OOTOBEI{. 28, 1895.

A.

SCHOTT,

Assistuut, in charge Computing Division, November 13, 1897.

The following results of heights of spirit leveling between Holliday and Salina, Kans., are berewith respectfully submitted. This is in continuation of the line of levels starting from bench mark (K 3 ) on the bridge across the Mississippi at St. Louis, Mo., and running westward via .Jetfor~on City and Kansas City to Holliday, about ~2 kilometres or 14 statute miles westerly of Kansas City.· The present extem>ion carries the line 276 kilometres, or 171~ miles (nearly), westward along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad to Topeka, Kans., and thence along the Union Pacific Railroad to Salina. The line begins at bench mark LXIII and ends at bench mark H 1· The heights are r('lative, and refer to the so-called "City directrix" at St. Louis as the zero or starting level. This level bas been transferred to bench mark K 3 at the St. Louis bridge. Should absolute beights be desired this starting level may be taken as 125.8 meters~ or 412·7 feet, above the Gulf of Mexico; the exact elevation can only be given after the co11necting lines are all completed a11d adjusted. Instruments.-Micrometer spirit level No. 5 was used. The constants of this instrument were determined in 18Q5-9G1 and the same were employed in the present computation. They are given in last year's Report, Appendix No. 3.t The wooden metric rods P and Q,t soaked in paraffin, bad their graduation and index corrections determined as follows:

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The c-0efficieut of expansion was but 0·000 004 per degree centigrade. Jl/etltod of observing.-The method of run· ning two independent line~, one forward the other backward, which has been followed since leaving Etlah, Mo., was abandoned for the old rnethod of runuiug two simultaneous parallel Jines, one with rod P: the other with rod Q. The average distance between the instrument and the rod was about 85 metres. Computations.-The field computation is by the observer, assisted by members of hi~ party. A. revision was made at the office, by Assistant F. A. Young, of the abstract of results as prepared by Mr. Winston; and lastly, Assistant J.B. Baylor made a final revision. Jun.c.lt. 011, C'ity Results.-The resulting heights of the bench .Tor~ A'i<:ay marks above the St. Louis standard level K:1 O,gden-~· I are contained in the tabular exhibit of the operation. The temporary marks along the line are ubout 1 ·1 kilometres apart;· the permanent bench marks number :{4. . Squaring the numbers in column" P-Q" we find the mean error m' of a single leveling of 1 kilometre.

The above values suppose the two measures, or the P and Q lines, to be independent of one another. This not being the case with simultaneous lines, where the conditions of the instrument and oftheatmosphereare the same for botll Jines, we increase the value of r by its fourth part and get the improved value ± 17·75 mm. The probable error of the height assigned to Holliday, distant from St. Louis, Mo., 481·6 kilometres, or 299·3 statute miles, was :!: 28·9 mm.; hence we have for the probable error of the height assigned to Salina, mark Hi the value .J(28;uf+(I7~7t>) 2 = ± 33·9 mm., as developed between St. Louis and Salina. The total distance between these stations along the line of levels is 757·7 kilometres, or 470·8 statute miles.

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSEH,V ATIONS MADE IN CONNECTION WI'l'H THE GREENLAND EXPEDITION OF 1896, UNDER CHARGE OF PH.OF. A. B. BURTON.

By G. R.

PUTNAM,

Assistant.

In the summer of 1896 the writer accompanied an expedition to the west coast of Greenland, organized by and under the direction of Prof. A. E. Burton. Among the objects contemplated in the plan for the scientific work of this party was the making of magnetic and pendulum observations, and the writer was invited to undertake this part of the work. On the recommendation of Gen. W. Duffield, Superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Ilouorable Secretary of the Treasury granted permission for the writer to accompany the party and to take with him the necessary instrumental outfit belonging to the Survey, on the condition, boweyer, that the Survey should bear no part of the expense of the field work. Thi8 party, with others, was transported to and from its tlestination by Lieut. R. E. Peary, U. S. N., the well-known arctic explorer, and a number of stops were made en route, both goiug and returning. The plan followed in the magnetic and pendulum work was to make observatious at all places where practicable during the voyage, as well as at the starting and destination points, including also one station (Ilalifax) where a necessary stop was made while on the way to join the expedition, the intention being to add such data as possible to the information in regard to the magnetic elements and the force of gravity in the region traversed. Such opportunities as offered for this work while en route with the general expedition were entirely incidental to the general plans, which were of course shaped by Lieutenant Peary to meet the diversified objects of the voyage and the various interests involved, being controlled also largely by the limited time available and the exigeucies of arctic voyaging. The work was, however, encouraged and facilitated by Lieutenant Peary in many ways, and the stops of the ship were often arranged with the convenience of this work in view. The observations themselves were made throughout by the writer, but in the preparation of the stations and in many other ways he bad the assistance of Professor Burton and the members of his party, which included, besides the writer, the following gentlemen: Prof. A. E. Burton,· Prof. G. H. Barton, and Mr. R W. Porter of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Mr. A. M. Dodge and Mr. J. C. Phillips of Harvard University. To these gentlemen thanks are due for the assh·tance rendered. · As the starting poiut of the expedition was at Sydney, Cape Breton, and several ·transfers were required before reaching that point, the writer arranged to go at the same time as the valuable instrumental outfit and personally see to its safe handling. Sailing from Boston on July 4, 1896, Halifax, Nova Scotia, was reached on July G. While waiting for steamer here magnetic observations were made at the secular variation station at the dock yard, permission being courteously granted by the British officers in charge. Reaching Sydney on July 10,

magnetic observations were made on July 11 and 13. By the 15th all the parties were embarked on the steamer Rope, a stanch Newfoundland sealing ship under command of Capt. ,John Bartlett. The various incidents of the voyage need not be detailed here. The accompanying outline map (plate No. 1) shows the course followed and the points at which magnetic observations were made. On August 5 the destination of Professor Burton's party, Umanak, in Danish Gremland, was reached, and here the party was left by the Hope, which proceeded north to carry out the other plans of Lieutenant Peary. At Umanak, because of the longer stay, a more complete series of observations was made. As the facilities available were not convenient for transporting the instrumental outfit in addit.iou to the other necessary camp equipment, the magnetic observations were confined to the stations in and near the village of Umanak, and were not included in the plan of work on the several expeditions that were made to the heads of the fiords and the glaciers to carry out other investigations, one of which the writer accompauied. At Umanak mauy facilities for the proseeution of the work were afforded. by l\:lr. Hjalmar Kunhtsen, the governor of the Danish dh;trict of Umanak, a vaca11t house being placed at the disposal of the party for living purposes and storage of instruments. At Godhavn, also, the Dauish officials were most courteous. Ou September !:I tlie party was again taken on board the Hope on the return voyage, 'vhich terminated at Sydney on September 2G, 1896.

Very, U.S. N., in 1881, and the wooden post left by him was found. It is in the rear of the English Church, 16 metres southeast from Nepean street, a11d 38 metres northeast from the cemetery fence. Observations were made at tliis point on September 2{), on the return from the north. Turnavik, Labrador (lat. 550 14'·6 N., long. 5go 20'·3 '\V.).-Observations were made at the identical point occupied by Uentenaut Very in 1881, on West Turnavik Island, in the midst of the small fishing settlement uuder charge of William Bartlett. The station is marked by a deep drill liole in the bare rock, about halfway between Bartlett's bom~e and the house in w1iich bis men live. Ashe Inlet, Big Island, north sho1·e of Hudson Strait (lat. 620 :32'·8 N., long. 70° 35'·3 \V.).l\:lctgnetic station was on east side of inlet, and about 23 metres west and 5 metres north of house occupied about ten years ago as a meteorological station by one of tlie Hudson Bay Expeditions.

Niantilik, Ournberland Sound (lat. 640 53'·5 N., long. 66° 19'·5 W.).-This station was located on southwest side of Oumberland Sound on a small island lying just west of the anchorage known as Niantilik or Winter Harbor, and about 5 miles south of the whaling station and Eskimo settlement at Umanaktuak or BlackJead. The magnetometer was located on a low rocky point projecting from near the center of the southeast side of the island, and nearly south of the little sailors' cemetery, by which the island may be identified. Station was marked by hole 2 centimetres in diameter drilled in gneiss rock. The astronomical positions as given for the stations are derived from various sources. The latitude at Umanak was determined directly by observations with the meridian telescope on four pairs of stars on two nights, the resulting value being 70° 40' 29"·2 ::!:: 0"·3. This would give for the position of the magnetometer 70° 40' 28"·8, and for the principal flagstaff near the governor's house 70° 40' 27"·6. The latitude at Niantilik is derived by comparing morning and afternoon sun observations for azimuth, and checked by a rough sun observation at noon. The remaining latitudes are from earlier observations and charts. The longitudes of all the intermediate stations have been computed from the three chronometers, Nos.1823, 1842, and 177, which were carried on the expedition, and are based on Sydney, Oape Breton, as a starting point and Washington, D. C., as an ending point. The stationary rates were determined at Sydney, Umanak, and Washington, and the traveling rates computed for the balance of the time. The results can not be considered as very reliable, for several reasons: The longitude of Sydney is uncertain probably by a second of time, and the chronometers were subjected to a considerable variety of temperature ,and other c:onditions, including a long railroad journey from Sydney to Washington before they were last rated. Nevertheless, the results by the three chronometers are fairly accordant and agree well with previous values except for the two Greenland stations. The following table (1) gives the results by the three chronometers and a comparison with previous values. Because of its unsatisfactory performance only one-third the weight is given to the results by chronometer 177. It "\';"ill be noted that the discordancies at the two Greenland stations between different authorities is considerable. At these two the values determined in 1896 have been adopted, while at the other points the means of' the present and earlier results have been used.

Instruments.--The instrumental outfit was as follows: Magnetometer No. 19 (one of the inst1;uments described and illustrated in Appendix No. 8, Heport for 1894), Dip Circle No. 4655 (Kew pattern, with horizontal support for needle, thus being suitable for work in high latitudes), 6584-19

chronometers 1823 (sidereal) and 1842 and 177 (mean time), Meridian Telescope No.13 (for latitude and time observations in connection with pendulum work), and a pocket alt-azimuth and compass instrument. There was also a tent suitable for either astronomical or magnetic observations, but it was usually necessary to carry on tile latter in the open air, either on account of lack of time to set up the tent, or because it was needed for the other work. The constants of magnetometer No. 19 (and magnet 19L) as determined by the writer at Washington in December, 1893, were as follows (in 0. G. S. units): Scale value, 1division=2'·00. Corrected distances on deflecting bars, 35·020 cm. and 49·020 cm. Temperature coefficient for 1 o O., q = 0·00049. Induction coefficient, h = 0·0125. Distribution coefficient, P = - 4·55. Moment of inertia at 100.5 O., M = 178·38. The value of the coefficient P was computed also from the observations on this expedition, giving a result - 3·80. The mean of this and the former value was adopted, or P = - 4·18. In some of the observations at Ashe Inlet, Godhavn, and Umanak, the south end of magnet i9 L was weighted with a small copper balancing ring, whose weight was 0·349 grammes, outer radius 14·0 mm., inner radius 12·0 mm., length 0·9 mm. At .Ashe Inlet and Godhavn the distance from center of ring to center of magnet was 20 mm., and at Umanak 22·5 mm. For the first distance the moment of inertia was computed to be 1·693, and for the second 2·064. In this new form of magnetometer the suspending fibre is attached to a rod extending above the stirrup in which the magnet is hung. This places the point of suspension so high above the center of gravity of the magnet that the effect of dip to tilt the magnet out of the horizontal is practically overcome in ordinary latitudes. The balancing ring was employed to test this question in high latitudes, the endeavor being to so place the ring as to make the magnet more nearly horizontal. A comparison of results for the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic force (H) from observations on the 8ame day, made with and without the balancing ring, indicates that the error due to lack of horizontality is at ~east very small.

Methods of observation and computation.-In the magnetic observations the system generally employed in the field work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey 1 with portable instruments was carried out so far as circumstances and available time would permit. One, two, or three days' observations were made. Where practicable both the elongations were obtained for declination, the dip was determined by two needles, the horizontal force by several sets of oscillll'tion and deflection observations made near together, and the true meridian by sun observations near the prime vertical in both morning and afternoon. · In many cases, however, this plan had to be modified by reason of lack of time or unfavorable weather, and in such event the attempt was made to get as even a distribution of data. as possible under the circumstances. At Umanak tbe true azimuth was derived from a meridian line laid out with the meridian telescope. At Turnavik, Ashe Inlet, and Niantilik (second observation), only oscillation observations were made to determine the horizontal force. These were treated relatively, comparing the time of oscillatiou with that at both the preceding and following stations at which full sets were obtained, and allowing for the progressive change in the magnetic moment of the magnet. The rates of the chronometers for reducing the oscillation observations were obtained from star observations with the meridian telescope at Sydney and Umanak, and for the remaining stations are derived from the intermediate traveling rates of the chronometers.

APPENDIX NO. 5.

Results.-The results of the magnetic observations for the different elements separately and for each day of observation are given in Tables 2, 3, and 4, and a general summary of all the results is given in Table 5. In Table 2, when the extreme declinations observed were assumed to be the elongations for the day, they are indicated by an asterisk(·), and in such cases the mean of the two elongations is taken as the mean declination for the day. When because of lack of time it was impossible to obtain these elongations, the declinations have been reduced to the mean of the day from such comparative data as were available, the references being given in the footnote. Where the declination observations were made, more or less continuously, covering any considerable part of the day, the average declination for this interval is given in the table, this average being obtained gr~phically by plotting the observed' values. For five days, on each of which the readings covered an interval of about twelve hours, the results are shown in the diagram (pl. 2), plotted to the same scale for the different places. The diagram for Niantilik on September 18 indicates a considerable magnetic disturbance on that date, as was also very apparent when the observations were in progress, for the needle would frequently move out of range of the telescope, necessitating the changing of the azimuth circle. There was a change of over 3° in twenty minutes; at 7h 35rn a. m. the needle pointed ooo 35' W. of N., while at 7h 55m it pointed 630 50' W. of N., and the total range for the day was over 4~0. Such disturbances, however, are not unprecedented in arctic experience.· The last column in Table 2 gives the diurnal range for the days on which elongations were obtained. These ranges can not be considered as average values for the respective localities, being possibly affected by abnormal conditions on these particular days, as is evident in the case of Niantilik. At Umanak, Godhavn, and Sydney declination observations were made at two or three neighboring points. At Sydney the difference obtained was insignificant, for dip as well as for declination. At Umanak t the westerly declination increases about half a degree in going from 100 to 200 metres either north or south from the magnetic station. Near Godhavn the declination is slightly greater across the harbor at Watsons Bay than in the village, though the difference is not so great as was indicated by the English observations in 1875, which may have been made in somewhat different localities. ·
*In The Manual of Natural History, Geology, and Physics of Greenland (London, 1875) it is stated that ·McClintock observed a change of 15°, and Sir Edward Belcher noted a disturbance of 27°·6 a.ccompanyiug an aurora. t A considerable number of compass obsen·ations of declination were made about Umanak Fiord by Danish officers (ABBistant Steenstrup and Lieutenant Hammer) in 1878and1879. The following passages translated from Meddeleltier om Gronl!md, fourth part., page 177 l Copenhagen, 1883), give some instances of the irregularity of the deoliuution noted by them in this region: "It Is a familiar .saying that the magnet neoclle on these shores is nearly dead, and that the magnetic declination, especially in trap-rock regions, is so variable that for geographical measurements it is necessary to determine it for every bearing, for it changes with every setting up of the compass. Thus a small movemo11t, only some few feet, effected on the Shades Islands a change of 5° in the measured declination; indeed, o.t Igdlorsuit, upon Ubekjendt Island, a movement from the houses up to the top of the mountain, about 1 500 feet high, lying about 2 000 feet away, was sufficicut to change t11e declination from 74°·0 to 34°·9. · · · In gneiss regions the local effect is not near so strong, but while the tro.p generally cu.uses greater declinations than one would expect from the geographical position, gneiss, on the contrary, not unusually appears to give less declinations." It is further remarked that normal conditions can often be found only upon the ice.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

In Table 6 is given a collection of former magnetic observations made at or in the vicinity of these stations. For many of t11ese points. it is probable that this data is quite incomplete, for results of this nature are publif;hed in a wide range of local literature often difficult of access. With the exception of Halifax 1 the observations are scarcely complete enough nor do they cover a sufficiently long interval of time to give satisfactory analytical expressions for the secular variation of the declination and dip. For most of the stations, however, the data are sufficient to clearly indicate the present tendency in the change of the magnetic elements. It appears that at all the points (omitting Niantilik, for which no earlier information was found) the westerly declination is diminishing, the northerly dip is diminishing, the horizontal force is increasing, and the total force is decreasing.

RESULTS OF PENDULUM OBSERVATIONS MADE IN 1895 AND 1896.

By G. R.

PUTNAM,

Assistant.

In this report will be brought together the results of a number of determinations of the force of gravity made at scattered points a.nd at various times during the years 1895 and 1896. No systematic investigations in this line have been carried out by the Ooast a.nd Geodetic Survey since the series described in Appendix No. r, Report for 1894. The determinations covered by the present report were for the most part made in connection with and incidental to other work of the Survey, and the location of the stations was consequently entirely dependent on such other operations. Thus of the fourteen stations (besides Washington) pendulum observations at ten were made in connection with telegraphic longitude determinations, nine of these points being located 'ill the southern part of the United States, and one in the extreme northeastern part. Four of the gravity determinations were made in connection with the Greenland expedition of 1896, under charge of Prof. A. E. Burton. With the permission of the honorable Secretary of the Treasury, and of the Superintendent of the Ooast and Geodetic Survey, the writer accompanied this expedition on the invitation of Professor Burton, by whom he was requested to undertake the magnetic and pendulum observa.tions contemplated in its plan. The circumstances of the expedition a.re reforred to in the separate report on the magnetic work. 1 Several of the stops of the ship, which gave sufficient time for the magnetic observations, were not long enough to allow of setting up the pendulum apparatus and the meridian telescope. Complete pendulum and time observations were obtained at two points, Sydney, Cape Breton, and Umanak, Greenland. At two other stations, Ashe Inlet and Niantilik, the pendulum observations themselves were sufficient, but the time determinations failed because of unfavorable weather, so that only an approximate rate correction can be introduced. · Description and geographical position of stations.-The position of the pendulum stations is shown on the accompanying map (plate 2), together with the course of the Greenland expedition. In Table 1 is a descriptive summary of the locations, the support of the pendulum case, and the measured flexure of the support and case. It will be noted that all the stations, with one exception (Niantilik), were located in buildings, and generally in basement rooms. The support for the case was always masonry, generally very low (not over ~O cm. above the floor). The flexure was measured statically as described in Appendix No. 1, Report for 1894, page 12. The figures in the last column represent the horizontal movement of the knife-edge when a force of 1·5 kilogrammes was applied horizontally in the plane of oscillation. The flexure was small and fairly uniform at these stations, probably a result of the uniform method of mounting the pendu1um case on very low and solid foundationR. The geographical positi<'ms of the stations are given with the final summary of results in Table 6. For the points in the United States, the latitudes and longitudes are derived from primary astronomical stations of the Ooast and Geodetic Survey, with which the pendulum stations were connected. The derivation of the positions of the stations on the Greenland expedition is detailed in the report on magnetic work in connection therewith. The elevations of the stations are based upon the best available sources. The pendulum stations were connected by hand level with known bench marks, railroad grades, or directly with the mean sea level, to obtain which rough tidal observations were sometimeR made.

·In the cases where the support is given as a floor or bed rock, tbe pendulum caee was u·nally mounted on one layer of bricks cemented to tho floor or rock, the footplate& being cemented to tho brio ks.

The location of the stations was favorable as regards freedom from outside vibration in all cases excepting New Orleans. Here the necessity of being convenient to the longitude observatory compelled the location of the pendulum apparatus in a basement close to a heavily traveled street. The jar of passing vehicles was quite noticeable, partly, perhaps, because of the generally unstable condition of the underlying ground. Although the coincidences were sometimes irregular, the periods of the three pendulums are in good accord, and no discrepancy appears between day and night observations, notwithstanding a considerable difference in the amount of traffic. Instruments and methods of observation.-The half-second pendulum apparatus and pendulums A4, A5 and A6 were used throughout this work. These pendulums (plate 1) have not been altered and have received no known injury since their first use in January, 1894. With a few slight exceptions, the methods of observation and computation described in Appendix No. 1, Report for 1894, were followed in the present work. As intimated on page 19 of that report, the plan was adopted of using two knife-edges. Pendulum A4 was always swung on knife-edge AII, and pendulums A5 and A6 were swung on knife-edge AI. Each of these edges is set in its own metal block so that it can be readily adjusted and secured in the pendulum case. The use of the two edges furnishes, it is believed, a necessary check on the invariability of the knife-edge, which is, of course, a vital part of the pendulum, whether it is a part of it or a part of the support, as in this form of apparatus. Because of the considerable change of period at the northern stations, it was found no longer sufficiently accurate to consider the temperature coefficient as a constant quantity. The value heretofore' used, 0··0000049 for 1° C, is correct for a period of 0··5007 484. Expressed as a function of the period (P), i~ becomes 0··00000837 x P for 10 O. Thermometer Green ~604 was used in the dummy pendulum at all these stations, as well as in all the previous series with these pendulums, with the exception of the observations at Washington in January, 1894. Its corrections were determined by the Office of Weights and Measures in June, 1890, and again in November, 1896, and its zero point was also tested in January and June, 1896. The correction at oo 0 has changed from OO·OO in 1890 to -0°·07 in 1896, and there is a fairly accordant change throughout the scale. The corrections adopted in this

Rates of chronometers.-The chronometer corrections were determined by star observations made with transit instruments in the meridian, the observations being recorded chronographically, except at Sydney and Umanak, where they were made by the eye-and-ear method. The pendulum swings covered the entire interval between time observations, being continued beyond the usual forty-eight hours, when necessary, until time was obtained. The comparisons between chronometers were made either chronographically or by coincidence of beats between mean time and sidereal chronometers. At the stations in the United States, the time observations were made with the longitude transits, and usually thf' time determinations made for the longitude work were used directly. At Sydney and U manak a small meridian telescope (No. 13, focal ·length 6;")·8 cm., aperture 5·1 cm.) was.used. As already mentioned, the time observations at Ashe Inlet and Niantilik failed because of unfavorable weather and the limited length of stay. The adopted rates at these points were obtained by combining the rates at the preceding and following stations, and the traveling rate, giving equal weight to the chronometers. In each case it is estimated that the adopted rate is uncertain by at least a second of time, which would correspond to an uncertainty of about 40 too in g (or 0.025 dyne or cm.). The rate at Ashe Inlet was derived as follows:

Table 2 gives a summary of the rates of the chronometers which were used directly in the pendulum observations at the different stations. In some cases two chronometers were employed, and in others only one. At Sydney one mean-time and one sidereal chronometer were used, and at the other three northern stations mean-time chronometers exclusively were used in the pendulum observations directly. This became necessary because the increase in the force of gravity so diminished the period of the pendulums that it approached closely to the sidereal balf second, and the coincidence interval with a sidereal chronometer would have become inconveniently long, but the pendulum was enough faster than a mean-time chronometer to give convenient coincidence intervals with it. With a mean-time chronometer the pendulum makes one more oscillation than the chronometer beats half seconds in an interval between two coincidences, so that the formula for the period becomes P= 2s~n wheres is the unmber of seconds and n the number of coin-

Results.-In. Table 3 are given the details of the observations and reductions for each swing. The temperatures as here given are the mean for the swing, properly weighted if more than two readings were taken, and corrected for thermometer error. The pressures are reduced to oo 0. In Table 4 are collected the mean periods for each pendulum and station, all reduced to the standard conditiomi, arc infinitely small, temperature 150 C., pressure 60 mm. at oo 0., sidereal time and inflexible support. The differences of each pendulum from the mean· of the three are also given. From these mean periods gravity at the various stations was computed from the rnlation
g0 =

~:: g.,, gravity at Washington, Coast and Geodetic Survey Office (g.,) being_ taken to be

980.098 dynes or centimetres, as before, and the mePu of the periods at Washington (Pw) before

and after each series being used for that series. The results for g computed separately for each pendulum and station, with the mean and differences from the mean, are given 'in Table 5. The unusual discrepancy between the values from the separate pendulums in the case of Laredo appears to be due to an error in the chronometer comparisons, which was not noticed in time for rectification. The results for this station must be considered as having a small uncertainty on this account. At Ashe Inlet and Niantilik the results can only be considered as approximations because of the failure to obtain sufficient time observations, as referred to under the head of rate. At these two stations each pendulum was swung only once, in position 'i reversed," but an examination of the periods at the various l'ltations indicates little or 110 systematic difference between the periods in the two positions.

The reduction to sea level was made by two methods, as in tile last report of the International Geodetic Association, 2 first, using Bouguer's formula., and second, omitting the attraction term in this formula. In the colunms of residuals + indicates an excess in the observed value of gravity and - a defect. The greater part of these stations are near the coast and at small elevations above the sea, so that the direct reduction to sea level is of minor importance. They are not so situated as to give much evidence on the question of the introduction of other metl10ds of reduction to sea level, such as were referred to in discussing the work of 18!)4.a

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Comparison of periods at Washington.-A comparative table of the periods of this set of pendulums as determined at different times at Washington was given on page 19, Appendix 1, Report for 1894. This comparison may now be extended as the same pendulums have been swung at Washington five times in 1895 and 1896, using similar methods. To compare the results, however, two corrections must be applied to the periods for 1894 and January, 1895, as already published. To allo,.v for the fact that in the later work pendulum A4 was swung on knife-edge II instead of I (as in 1894) 0··0000013 must be subtracted from the perio1l of A4 as previously given. To allow for the change in zero point of thermometer 6604 (referred to under "Instruments"), assuming that this change took place previous to 1894 (the first determination of the thermometer corrections being four years previous) +0··0000003 must be added to the J)eriods of all three pendulums as previously given. Applying these corrections to the 1894 determinations the results are collected in table 7. These show a total range in the mean period of the three pendulums of 0··0000008, and a range in the yearly means of only 0··0000001. When it is considered that these pendulums during the interval of two and one-half years covered, have been swung at fifty stations (including Washington) and have been transported many thousand miles by rail and ship, the permanency of period is certainly satisfactory. Whether this constancy of the pendulums can be ascribed to the reversed position of knife.edge and plane adopted in this apparatus there is little evidence to determine, as there are no series of observations with the other form of pendulum corresponding either in length of service or in the method of eliminating irreguladties in the chronometer rates. 'fhese results further indicate that if variations in the force of gr~vity at any one locality are looked for, the experimental work must be on such a plan as to accurately develop minute differences in period.

Check determinations at A1tstin.-At Austin, Tex., three independent determinations of the periods of the pendulums were made, opportunity to tlo thiR being afforded by the fact that ..Austin was used as one end of several of the longitude determinations on which the writer was engaged. On April 29 to May 1, 1895, the pendulums were swung in the basement of the granite capitol of the State of Texas. The apparatus was then taken to Laredo and Galveston, and brought back to Austin again, where on June 5 to 7 obser.vations were made in the basement of. the State

UniYersity, the pendulums being swung in an east and west plane. On June 10 to 12 they were again swung in the same location at the State University, but in a north and south plane. To compare the observations at Austin allowance must be made for the fact that the location at the University was 19 metres higher than, and 41 seconds of latitude north of, that at the capitol. To reduce to the university the correction to the periods at the capitol is +0··0000008, being +o·.0000010 for elevation and -0··0000002 for latitude. Applying this correction to the periods at· the capitol the observations give the following corrected periods:

A comparison of the results indicates, as was anticipated, practically no .differeuce in the periods of the pendulums due to the direction of the plane of oscillation. They further show a difference of only the millionth part in the independent determinations made at Austin at different times and in diffo.rent places.

NOTES RELATING TO SELF-REGISTERING TIDE GAUGES AS USED BY THE UNITED. STATES OOAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

By J.1", PRATT, Assistant.

The first self-registering device used by this service, and undoubtedly the first use"d in America, for continuously and automatically recording the exact time and actual rise and fall of the surface of water caused by the various tidal movements at its locality, was used at Governors Island in New York bay and harbor during a portion of the year 1844, being kept in operation during the winter of 1844-45. The report for the latter year states that it worked "moderately well," but adds that "the mechanical execution of the screw, upon which the working of the machine depends, was not sufficiently perfect for this purpose and has caused some stoppages in the apparatus," and concludes, "a self-registering gauge devised by Mr. Saxton, of the office of weights ancl measures, seemed so much more perfect than this that it was determined to make trial of it before causing other gauges to be constructed." This second, or "Saxton," gauge was evidently adopted and used in 1845, and its use continued as the gauge of this service for forty-five years. It is fully described and illustrated in Appendix No. 38, Report for 1853. The accompanying illustration, made from one of the later ones constructed, shows its general appearance. During this long period of service very few changes in form of construction were made. The earlier ones were largely made of wood, whereas in the later ones metal was substituted where practicable, the1 most essential change being made about 1877, when patent-lever escapements supplanted the seconds pendulums of the clocks, as the latter proved troublesome when the gauges had to be used on exposed wharves that had much vibration. Briefly, the ~'Saxton" gauge operates as follows: Two movements are provided for, the first being a uniform movement in proportion to the time, and the second a movement at right angles to the former and strictly proportioned to the rise and fall of the water at its particular locality, the resultant of these two movements producing a continuous curve on a sheet about 13 inches wide and of sufficient lengtl. to last about a month. For the first movement a clock is connected, by au adjustable clutch, with a cylinder, over which the continuous paper passes; this cylinder, thus driven by the clock, revolves uniformly once in twelve hours; ·projecting from the surface of. this cylinder, and near each of its extremities, is a row of 24 equidistant sharp points, which puncture the edges of the continuous sheet with dots representing half-hour intervals. These points, by means of the adjustable clutch, are made to correspond to the bands on the face of the clock and serve to propel the ·paper along at the same rate tbat they are moving, unwinding it from the supply roller and allowing it to be wound upon the receiving roller, a tension on the former being caused by its winding up, on a spool attacbed to one of its ends, a cord to which a small weight is imspended, and on the latter roller, by another cord to which a somewhat heavier weight is n.tta.cbed, unwinding from a similar spool. This latter weight serves not only for tension, but also to wind the paper up as the time cylinder relieves it.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

For the second movement a copper float, hermetically sealed, is allowed to freely float in a vertical box or tube whose inner diameter is somewhat larger than the diameter of the float, and which has a controllable inflow and outflow at its uottom, to prevent undue motion of the float caused by waves. To the top of the float is attached a copper wire leading up through the float box or well, and wound up on or m1wound from the large receiviug wheel, a sufficient tension to tliis wire being maintained uy a counterweight acting on a smaller wheel fixed to the receiving wheel shaft. On ·the receiving wheel shaft a small cylinder is fixed, and the scale iu height of the record or curve is the relation between the circumference of this small cylindrical wheel and that of receiving wheel. 'l'his proportion is so made as to cause the record curve to fall bet ween the two marginal lines of dots. By providing each gauge with several of these cyliuders of different sizes, each to a specific scale, ti.Jc same gauge can be used in successive localities where the amount of rise and fall may differ very materially. A fine chain or wire, atfalcl.Jed to and winding on the small cylinder, leads vertically to a small pulley, over which it is deflected to a horizontal position and attached to the pencil carrier which is so constructed that it can move uack and forth along a guide transversely to the lines of dots. A cord leads horizontally from the opposite side of the pe11cil carrier and passes over a second and opposite deflecting pulley to a pencil counterweight. As the tide rises the float wire is wound up on the receiving wheel uy its counterweight, which at the same time unwinds the fine wire from the small cylinder, thus permittiug the pencil counterweight to draw the pencil a distance proportional to the actual rise of the float. When tlie tide falls the foregoing movements are reversed. In 1890, after a trial of alwut four years of a sample one, a tide gauge designed by Mr. A. Stierle, assistant, United States Engineer Corps, was atlopted, principally on account of its being more compact and portable, its record ueing identical with that of the" Saxton" gauge. It is M described by Mr. Stierle as follows:
The principles of the gauge are not new. 'Vith a plain eight-day marine clock ("Seth Thomas") is connected, by a clutch, a light brass drum or cylinder, A, around which the recording sheets are laid, over which the continuous paper passes, as one or the other, respectively, is used. This cylinder revolves twice in twcntyFig.1 four hours, or only once, if so ordered, and is provided upon its surface with two rowH of needle points, each row (of twelve points) being near 0110 eud of the cylinder, which puncture tho paper and thus mark the time abscissas, either of one or twohonrs' duration. The cylinder can be lifted out of tho frame after the clutch connecting it with the clock has been moved back. The Yariations of tho water level are transmitted directly by a copper float, D, and a thin brass band, E, upon the periphery of a deeply grooved wheel, F, exactly 1 foot in circumference, whose projecting double flange shows throe cycloidal notches which extend to t110 bottom of the grooved rim. The rectilinear distance between these notches is 4 inches, and corresponds with tho distauce between the small crossbars riveted upon the flout band E. The wheel I·' fits loosely upon the end of tho screw G, made of phosphor-bronze, but can be jammed with tho nut H. The screw G itself sets loosely between tho framework, anll, together with tho wheel F, revolve!! as the float D rises or falls, and thereby causes the pencil holder I, which with its threaded core embrncrs the screw, to morn righ't or left at the rate of 1 inch for every foot the float ascends or descend8 with tho rise or fall of the water level. By a combination of a few parts closely connected a constant record of tho height of a water level is thus · transmitted and red1rced upon the recordiug paper with great accuracy, an accuracy which under all conditions remains tho same and ill measurable if the const.antll are lirHt determined relath·e to the chauges in tho floating liuo or line of submergence on the float nt different st:tges of water, and those relating to the exact length of the float band E, the circumference of tho wheel F, and the pitch of the screw G. Tl1e play or "backlash" of the mccl1anism when in motion is very small and can be accurately measured. It may be nddod here that the Hoale of reduction as projected upon the recordiug sheets may be mndo of any

On the rear of tho fr11.me, an<l upon tho same liorizontal piano with the screw G, a gmduatod rod, J, is placed, upon which is clamped the J.>encil holder K, for tho so-en lied stationary pencil. This pencil traces upon the recording sheet any assumed or established reference or base line, usually tho zero of a tine staff, from which the ordinates of a cun·e representing tho water level can bo readily measured. The copper float D rises arnl falls with the water level in a Aqua.re box, the interior clear area of which is about lit inches larger in width than tho diameter of the float, its length being such as to reach about 1 foot below tho lowest known water level of the locality und about 6 inches above the floor of tho house in which the gauge is set. The box is closed on the lower end (if in muddy water, preferably somewhat funnel-shaped), a small opening not over one-half inch in area being loft in the center. One of the interior corners of tho box is divided from the rest by a thin strip of wood extending the full length of the box, forming tlrns a separate compartment, in which tho counterweight attached to the float baud moves up and down. \Vhen t.ho gauge is ensy of access and is to re<'ord fluctuations of a. water level which nro not very irregular and yet of grent range, It is more economical and also more convenient for a rapid compilation of results to use sin~le sheet:! for recording instcacl of continuous paper. These sheets nre held upou tho cylinder A by rubber bnnds and should be rn inches long, lapping abotit 1 inch at tho edge, in a direction opposite to which the cylinder morns. Tho manner in which coutirmous pnper is att1whed and used has been referred to abo,·o and shovn on tho accompanying engraving. It remains, howoYor, to follow somewhat in detail ita movement from one roller to the other when tho gauge is running. Tho imper moves in tho same direction us the hands of a clock and is drawn along, as it were, by tho needle points upon the cylinger A. This mo,·emeut is materially assisted, but not aoeelerated, by a light counterweight, )1, which is su8peuded from a shoo.Ye or pulley, N, fitted upon the axle of the wooden roller C. The cord is fastened with one end to the hub of the sheave N, and is coiled or wound upon the latter in such a manner that it mnst unwin<l as tile vapor rolls upon tho roller C. The free end of the cord is then simply.laid over the opposite pulley, O, on the roller ll, an<l both pulleys are clamped tightly upon the axles with the set-screws. Tho weight 111 causes o. slight tension in the paper between the roller und the cylinder A. and thereby assists in laying the paper evenly nnd smoothly upon tho roller C. lly laying the end of the cord from which the weight 111 is suspended over. the pulley O, tbe 111itli11g friotion caused thm:eby retards tho movement of the pulley slightly and prevents the puper from being unwound too mpidly from tho roller B. It is impossible to space the ueecllo points on the cylinder A exuctly 1 inch apart. The slightest difference in that respect is multiplic1l npon u long sheet of pupe1'. Every gauge, therefore, should have its own scale of abscissas, con~trncted upon a strip of pnper, using tho punctures mnde by the needle points as unite.

The "Stierle" tide gauge as described has been modified by this service from time to time, as deemed advisable and ad van"tageous. The two accompanying illustrations (plates 4 and 5) show its appearance as modified to date. The following are some of the more important changes: In 18t12, on the recommendation of Assistant E. E. Haskell, the use of the "deeply grooved" sprocket wheels and the "float band" was discontinued, and a grooved or screw float wheel and small copper or phosphor-bronze float wire substituted. By this arrangement, with the present size of float, the line of flotation or submergence remains practically constant, and, besides, the annoyance and loss of record caused by the sprocket band riding upon the rim of the sprocket wheel, which occurred. from time to time, is avoided. In 1894 an attachment, designed by Mr. l!'. M. Little, of the tidal division, for more accurately keeping and marking the time, was applied. In the original form the single clock bad, in addition to keeping time, to 'propel the "drum or cylinder" carrying the paper, this being at different stages a fluctuating load, causing the clock to gain or lose, it being almost impossible to regulate it so that it would keep correct time for an exteuded period. This "hour-break" attachment, as it is cailed, consists or'an additional and indepe.udeut clock, that simply has to keep time, and the break mechanism, actuated by a clock spring, that the time-keeping clock trips at the end of every hour. On the back of the time clock and attached to its minute silaft is an arm which at the eud or beginning of each hour trips the trigger projecting from the break mechanism. This permits the crank, working in the slotted arm, to make one revolution. This slotted arm is fastened to the end of the lower rod, which is the axis of the frame. Over the upper rod the hook from the peucil carrier hangs, but not in contact, and the pencil holder is pivoted in the pencil carrier so that the l)encil can be rocked, allowing its point to trace a line about 5 millimeters long and parallel with the length of the paper. The pencil is held in its normal position by a small spiral spdng, one end being attached to tile-pencil l.10lder and the other to tlle pencil carrier. At the end of every hour the time clock releases the trigger, and thus the break mechanism rocks the frame over which the pencil-holder hook bangs, causing tlie pencil to move back and forth, thereby recording the hour exactly, regardless of what the rate or time of the driving clock may be. These hour breaks are shown on the accompanying reduction of a tidal record. (Fig. 2.)

The foregoing attachment has proved so satisfactory tbat it is now considered indispensable. Subsequently the ends of the screw along which the pencil carrier traverses have been turned down, so that in case of an abnormal tide, greater than provided for by sPale, the nut to the pencil carrier runs off the screw, permitting it to· freely turu. When the tide turns and the motion of the screw is reversed, the fl.at spring, with an aperture in its free end against which the nnt l1as been pressing, forces the nut back so that the screw takes it again. As originally devised, when the nut reached the end of the screw it jammed against the frame of the instrument and stopped the movement of the screw and float wheel, and as the tide continued to rise the float band or wire would become slack and run off the wheel, thus disarranging the gauge until the next time that it was visited by the observer.

is now made by a flat spring bearing up under the supply roll, instead of by a weight, as described by Mr. Stierle. More recently the forms of the supply and receiving rollers, as can be seen in the plate showing the clock faces, have been radically changed. The openings through the center of the rolls as received from the manufacturers vary somewhat, and the supply roller is now constructed with springs at each end to fi.Utbe varying diameters and always keep the roll concentric with the axis of rotation. The receiving roller is now made tubular, with a narrow slit cut longitudinally its entire length. In starting, the end of the sheet is introduced into the slit, held by moderate pre:;sure at its middle point, which, as the paper is wound up, enables it to readily adjust itself square with the-direction of moti<m, thus preventing it from riding up on one side, turning.an edge over, .or jamming. The changes as described and illustrated were made to gauges of the " Stierle" pattern already in existence; as it becomes necessary to provide more, the proportions, forms of castings, etc., will be made, so as to reduce the number of parts, making the instrumeut more simple in general appearance, and, as there will be nothing then to undo, less expem1ive to construct.

PREFACE TO PART I.

·when the plan of this Manual of 'fidos was propose(l it was considered best to prepare Part Ill in advance of Parts I aud ll. The reasons for this at;e stated in tho prl'face to J>art III, which appeared in the H.eport for 18!)4~ where a brief outline of the several parts ma~' he found. Before attempting to point out the contributions of individuals to the subject of the tides, it has seemed best to give, as an introduction: (1) the defiuitions of terms of .common occurre11ce; (2) a clear idea concemiug the movements of fluid particles in simple 'vave motion; (3) a popular account of th~ cause of the tides; (4-) the geueral properties of tides, and tidal inequalities together with means of ascertaining tbem. In the chapters which tben follow 110 attempt is made to include the histories of those sciences (e.g., astronomy and hydrodynamics) with which all stuuy of the tides is closely connected, nor is it even attempted to give anything like a catalogue of tidal workers, or a full account of their works; but these chapters aim to give, in a nearly chronological order, some account of such results, work, or theories as may seem worthy of notice, generally because they mark some advance in the development of the su'Qject, but sometimes either because they illustrate certain errors into which iudividuals have fallen or simply because they show the notions which have been entertained in the past. As a rule direct quotations are taken in preference to comments whenever they seem to serve the purpose in hand. A vague rule for deciding how far to describe or carry out the work of those individuals wbo have made extensive or profound investigations in connection with the tideH, has been to either omit or to barely state such portions of their work as will probably he resumed or at least referred to in subsequent parts of this manual. But those portions of their work which will probably not recur, or not recur uncha,nged in form, have been g·iven or described in gTeater detail, especially if they are well known or useful. Concerning the work of Thomson aud Darwin, it may be said that a large portion of it will of necessity appear as we proceed. When this is uot the case, reference will be made at l)roper times. For this reason it has seemed uuwise to llere attempt auy comprellensive or minute account of their labors. 0584--21 321

INTH.ODUCTION AND HISTORICAL TRBATMENT OF THE SUB,JECT.

By HOLLIN A. HA.RltIS. CHAP'rEI~

DEFINITIONS.

1. The principal movements of the sea may be divided into three classes: Ordinm·y or wind wai:es, tidal movements, aud ocean currents. The essential feature of any tidal movement is, as the name implies, its periodicity. The period may not be of co us taut leugth, but if variable it must follow some conceivable law. In conformity with this notion the word ti<le may be defined as the periodic rising and fulling of oceanic and other large bodies of water, due mainly to the attraction of the moon aud sun as the earth rotates upon its axis. This rising aud falling is accompanied by and depends upon a lateral or horizoutal movement of the waters; such move. ments are called tidal currents. Their periodic character distinguishes them from ocean currents. Uemarkable stages of the water level at a giveu place, whether due to earthquakes, gales, or other causes which probably have 110 defiuite law of recurrence, although popularly known as "tidal waves," can not be regarded as belonging to tidal phenomena. On the other hand, the stages of a river, if periodic in their nature, ma.y with propriety be included in its tides. 2. The tide rises until it reaches a maximum height called high water, and theu falls until it reaches a minimum height called low water. These two phases of the tide may be spoken of as the tides. The difference between a high and a low water is called a range of tide, and so is independent of absolute heights; its average value is called the mean range (Mn). For a few minutes before and after high or low water, it is difficult to observe any vertical motion in the tide. While thus apparently stationary, the tide is said to stand. In this connection sec
§ 15.

For reasons to be given later, based upon the fact that the tides are due chiefly t-0 the differ· ence between the moon'R attraction upon the enveloping sea aud the earth as a whole, one would expect that at most tidal stations two high waters and two low waters would occur each lunar day; in other words, to each transit of the moon (inferior as well as superior) there would correspond one high water and one low water. On an average, the time of high water at a given station follows the time of transit by a certain uumber of hours and mizrntes, called the high-water interval (HWl), or high-water lunitidal interval, or corrected establishment. In like manner the low-water interval (LvVI), or low-water lunitidal interval, indicates, unless otherwise specified, the average number of hours and minutes between the time of transit and the time of low water. If intervals at some particular time are meant they should be properly distinguished by name or otherwise; or the average values may, for distiuction, have the word mean prefixed to their name. The establishment or vulgar establishment is the (apparent local) time of high water occurring at new or foll moon; or, preferably, and what is about the same thing, the high-water i11terv1ll when the transit (just preceding the tid~) occuri:; at uoon or mitluight.11<

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

An inequality in interval, range, or height is a systematic departure of the same from its mean value. The extreme amount of this regular departure is sometimes caJled the coefficient of the inequality. 3. Not long after new or full moon, the tidal effect of the sun is added to that of the moon. When this effect upon the range is greatest the tides are called spring tides (marces de vive ea1t). At any given place the retard, or inte:rval between new or full moon and spring tides, may be regarded as constant. Not long after the moon is in quadratur~, the tidal effect of the sun is taken away from that of the moon, and when the range becomes a minimum from this cause neap tides (marces de morte eau) occur.· Their retard at a given place may be regarded as constant, and it does not differ much from the retard of the spring tides, unless the water is shallow, in which case the retard (spring or neap), as derived from the high waiters alone, will differ from that derived from the low waters. The inequality, or apparent irregularity, in time or height introduced by the sun, and so dependent upon the moon's phase, is variously styled the semimenstrual, 11emimensual, semimonthly, or phase inequality; the last seems preferable for most purposes, because there are several kinds of month in common use, especially in tidal work, and the word "phase" suggests a connection with the age of the moon.t When the sun's tidal effect shortens the lunitidal intervals, causing the tides to occur earlier than usual, there is said to be a priming of the tide; when, from the same cause, the interval is larger than usual, there is said to be a lagging. A tidal day is the variable interval (2411 50'" on an average) between two alternate high or low waters. A more accurate definition is the interval between the mean of four consecutive tides and the mean of the succeeding or preceding group of four consecutive tides. The amount by which the tidal day exceeds 241i 50111 is sometimes called the "lagging of the tide," and the amount which it falls short the "priming." The amount by which corresponding tides grow later day by day (i. e., the amount by which the tidal day exceeds 2411 00 111 ) may be called the <laity retardation.t The retard, especially spring and more especially spring high-water, bas been called the age of the tide.§ If this term is to be retained, it seems desirable to suppose the age to have one value, and that such as to suit the neap as well as the spring tides, the low waters as well as the high. Moreover, instead of "age of the tide," the expression "age of the phase inequality" will generally be used in what follows. It will subsequently appear that, for deep water at least, the Iunitidal interval of such tides as happen to occur as many hours after syzygy as represent the age of the phase inequality, have their mean values. In other words, the spring and neap intervals are about equal to the mean intervals. Because of this fact the times of such tides as give mean intervals may be used in determining the age. Experience has shown that the ages as determined from heights or ranges do not agree with those determined from times (intervals).11 For this reason it seems best, wherever possible, to define it by the value obtained from the harmonic constants of the place and explained in Part III.fl

·The spring and neap ranges are conveniently denoted by the symholA Sg, Np. Their connection with Mn is shown by the e.pproxime.te expressions (83), (84 ), Pe.rt III. When JI· has a large sbe.llow-water part (21\lS), as at Liverpool, so that 2 M02 -S0.,-µ 0, is not near zero, it may be worth while to replaceµ, in those expressions byµ, co::1 (2 .M02-S",-uo,). tThore are Home objections to the term "phase inequality" inasmuch na particular portions or aspects of the tide, such aa high water, low water, or an intermediate time, may be referred to ll8 itM pbaseH. Again, according to established usage, the phase of a wave, or oscillation, is the nngle upon which the displacements depend; e. g., the phase of the harmonic oscille.tion is the angle ct+ y. t Cf.

Since successive transits of the moon occur on an average 12" 25 111 apart, the age cau be approximately expressed by stating the number of the transit preceding the tide to which the lunitidal intervals are to be applied.· Tile eftect of selecting an earlier transit is to increase the lunitidal interval by 1211 25m, Of course, by adapting the transits to a suitallle terrestrial meridian, any age can be allowed for. Another way of reckoning the age is by the hour of the moon's transit. The time of transit increases on an average 50"' daily, so that if the transit used for spring tides occur at 011 50 such transit follows syzygy by 24 11· :But the tide follows tile transit by the lunitidal interval;

Whenever the "hour of transit" exceeds 12\ 1211 must be r~jected. The sa111e formula is a<lapted to neap tide, by replacing the word'' maximum" by the word "minimum," and always discarding 611 or 18" from the "hour of transit." t To infer the age from the time when the interval 'has, its mean value, replace "maximum" range by" mean lunitidal interval,"=~ (HWI + LWI). Some writers prefer to increase the age or retard, as defined above, by the high-water interval, because of the fanciful notion that they thereby obtain the interval between the transit of the moon and the appearance of the resulting high water. 4. Other things being equal, the range of tide becomes a maximum soon after the moon is in perigee and a minimum soon after she is in apogee. At these times perigean and apogean tides occur.t The amount by which these effects follow their respective causes may be called the age OJ the parallax inequality. Like the age of the phase inequality it may be defined in terms of the harmonic constants.§ If this nge be approximately allowed for by selecting a proper transit, the lunitidal interval will, so far as this inequality is concerned, remain nearly constant throughout its period, which is au anomalistic month. If, however, the intervals be distributed under two arguments, the moon's phase and her parallax or anomaly, the departures from the average values of the intervals will depend upon both arguments. The phase inequality being known for a mean value of the moon's parallax, the tabular values just describe<l give, when diminished thereby, the parallax inequality in interval arranged under two arguments. Even when thus distributed, .the parallax inequality in time is small; but the parallax inequality in height is of considerable importance.\\ If a wrong age of the parallax inequality be taken (i. e., if the tides be referred to a wrong transit so far as this inequality is concerned), the inequality in interval will become greater.~1 If the tides are not classified with respect to the moon's phase (i. e., if they are classified with respect to parallax or anomaly only), the value of the parallax inequality in time will, as already stated, be small i( the transit used corresponds well with the a.ge of the parallax inequality. 0 5. In a similar way the effect of the moon's declination or longitude may be considered. Soon

after the moon is upon the equator the greatest semidaily range of tide will occur, other things being equal, and soon after the moon's extreme declination, the smallest. If a transit be selected which corresponds well with the age of this inequality, the intervals will bP, as i11 the case of the parallax inequality, little affected by i.ts preseuce. There is one difference, however, and that is, the sun's declination has a direct effect upon the lunitidal intervals, even if the proper transit has been selected. The period of the sun's decli11ational inequality in the tides is, in the long run, the same as that of the moon's, viz., a half tropic mouth, and so the two can not be separated in the treatment of a long series of observations all distributed under one argument-tlle moon's declination or longitude.· 'fhis combined effect may be styled the dcclinational inequality. Its age is pretty uearly equal to that of the phase inequality. G. Other irregularities in the motions of the moon and sun give rise to corresponding appiirent irregularities or inequalities in the tides. Among these may be meutione1l one depending upon the longitude of the moon's node, one upon the moon's evection, and one upou the sun's anomaly. t In ascertaining how the tide of a given day is disturbed by the inequalities, care should be taken to observe whether or not one inequality is involved in another. For instance, if the moon's anomaly is the argument for the parallax inequality, the tabular yalues (if dt>rived from a sufficiently long series of observations) will be free from the inequality due to the evection, :111d this latter may be tabulated and usl'd as an independent correction. If, however, the moon's parallax be taken as an argument, the inequality due to cvection, i.e., having the evectional period, must be small in comparison with its former value, because it is, for the most part, tabulated under the argument "parallax." So if we use the moon's longitude as an argument, the declim1tional inequality (semidiurnal) will, in the long run, be free from tl1e inequality due to the regression of' the lunar node. If, however, tlle declination of the moon, instead of the longitude, be used as an argument, the nodal inequality will be nearly allowed for. 7. Diurnal inequality in height is the difference in height between two consecutive high waters or low waters.f Diurnal inequality in time or interval is the difference in length of two consecutive high watl'r intervals or low water intervals. · At most places the high water inequality (in height or time) differs from the low water inecp1ality. If the greater 11eight inequality be in the high waters, the greater time inequality will be in the low waters, and conversely. Wherever both of the height inequalities are small in comparison with the (semidaily) range of tide, the inequalities in time (interval) are very small. . These inequalities vary in valne throughout a half tropical month, and also a half tropical year. 'l'he portion due to the moon may be computed and tabulated nnder the argument of the moo11's declination (as it was at a time anterior to the time required, determined by the age of the diurnal fnequ<tlity§). The portion due to the sun may be tabulated with the two arguments, the day of the year and the hour of the moon's (upper) transit reckoned from 0 to 24.JJ The combined effect of moon and sun may be made to follow the moon's declination and the day of the year. If this iuequality be comparable in size with the phase inequality, the two should be tabulated t-0gether, thus necessitating a table of three arguments, the two just mentioned and the hour of transit. If, however, we disregard the variation in the obliquity of the lunar orbit to the plane of the equator, two arguments suffice for the combined effect, viz., the hour of transit and the day of the year; for tliese two then infer the moon's right ascension and so her longitude or declination. The number ot' days from the moon's zero or extreme declination is preforable to the day of the

year as an argument. But for the variation in the obliquity of the lunar orbit to the plane of the earth's equator, very good predictious could be made from tables having these two arguments.· The diurnal wave is that portion of the tide whose period is approximately one day. Its range varies throughout the half tropical month and half tropical year. The maximum value of this range may be r~garded as occurring, in the long run, a constant number of hours (viz., the age of the diurnal inequa!ity) after the moon reaches her extreme fortnightly declination; at such times tropic tidest are said to occur, because for most places the moon is then near one of the tropics.f 'l'he age of the diurnal inequality is such that if the times of zero declination be increased thereby, the range of the diurnal wave will be a minimum. This age, like the ages of other inequalities, may be expressed in terms of the harmonic constants.§ 1'he diurual inequality is due to the preElence of the diurnal wave. A.t the time of the tropic tides, the diurnal inequality (time or height) may be spoken of as tropic. The inequality in high water heights is then denoted by HWQ and in low water LWQ. The larg·er one then has its maximum value very nearly; so has the quantity VHWQ2 + LWQ2 , which is an approximate expression for the tropic range or the diurnal wave, aihl with greater reason. At places wbere H\VQ, say, is several times smaller than LWQ, the high water inequality when tropic tides occur may not have, even approximately, its maximum value. Of the four ranges of tide upon a day when tropic tides occur, the greatest is called the great tropic (Ge) and the least the small tropic (Sc). The mean range from all four tropic tides is the moon tropic range (Mc). II The great [diurnal] range (Gt) is the difference between the mean of all the higher high waters (HHW) and the mean of all the lower low waters (LLW) of each day during one or more half tropical months. The .~mall [diurnal] range (SI) is the difference between the mean of all the lower high watei·s (Lff'W) and the mean of all the higher low waters (HL,V) of each day during one or more half tropical months. It is sometimes convenient to distinguish between the four ranges, which at most stations occur upon any given tidal day, by means of the following terms: The great range, the small range, the high ra.nge, and the low range. (See Fig. 1.) At stations where the tide is diurnal there are but two ranges each tidal <lay, the great and the small. 'rhe great tropic range and the lunitidal intervals connected with it can be observed even if the tide becomes wholly diurnal iu its character. So with the great diurnal. The sequence of Ude is the order in which the four tides of a. day occur, particularly the tropic tides. It may be expressed thus, "higher high to lower low," or ''lower low to higher high," as the case may be.

where HWQ and L WQ are very unequal, the sequence, even of the tropic tides, may be differe11t for different seasons of the year. The type of tide is its characteristic form. It is generally indicated by the sequence of tides, the ratios of the t.ropic diurnal inequalities, and of the spring range, to the mean range. For sllallow waters, however, in rivers especially, the duration of rise or fall may become very important.

Fig. 1 illustrates the tropic tides and quantities connected with them at Sau Francisco. In this case the tide is largely diurnal, the sequence is HHW to LLW, and LWQ > HWQ. 8. Tbe Ude curve or marigrani is a curve whose abscissm increase uniformly with the time, and whose ordinates represent the heights of tl1e tide or sea at the corresponding times. The average value of the ordinates of the tide curve (reckoned from some fixed mark upon the shore) defines the height known as mean sea level or mean water level. The average value of the heights of high and low waters (reckoned from some fixed mark upon the shore) defines the height known as half-tide level. Mean sea level and half-tide level do not differ much from each other except at places where the duration of fall difiers by a considerable amount from the duration of rise, or where the diurnal inequality is large.· Mean sea level (MSL) is the most nearly fixed, and therefore the best, of all plane:. defined by the tide. Planes used in reducing soundings or in reckoning elevations above the sea should always have a known relation to mean sea level, or at least to half-tide level (HTL). The plane of average or mean low water is one-half Mn below half-tide level. The soundings

The plane of mean low-water (ordinary) springs is about one-half Sg uelow half-tide level or mean sea level. This is the plane generally used along the outer coasts of Europe.

In many localities the datum of soundings is an arbitrary, but known, distance below a fixed bench mark. In the establishment of any such plane the hydrographer usually aims at some

plane which is capable of definition with respect to the tide; e.g., mean low water, low-water springs, etc. In a few cases the plane of reference is the height of the lowest observed tides. Of course a datum of this kind cannot be recovered unless through an established bench mark. Since all datum planes must be connected with mean sea level, it might be advisable to· reduce soundings to a plane an integral number of feet below this level, the same number to be used over a considerable area, and to be determined by the lowest tides likely to occur. Such areas or regions could be indicated upon the charts. Some hydrographers have used the expression "low-water springs" to denote extremely low low waters due to variom1 inequalities in the tide. Such careless usage should be discouraged. Heights on the land when accompanied by the expression "above tide" or "A. T.," usually refor to high water. This is objectionable, because the height of high water depends upon the range of the tide; and this in turn upon the locality of the tidal observations. Above mean sea or mean water level is a much less objectionable signification. In connection with tidal planes, see§ 20, Part II, and §§ 42-45, Part III. 9. Tidal constants are certain intervals (angles) and heights (amplitudes) used in describing the tide; they are absolutely constant, or nearly so, at a given place. Nonharmonic constants are those tidal constants which refer in some way to high and low water instead of to the constituent periodic elements into which, as will be shown in Part II, the tidal wave may be resolved. Harmonic con.~tants refer to these periodic eleme11ts. The portion of the tide following any period strictly, can, by Fourier's theorem, be analyzed into one or more simple cosine terms whose angles or arguments (which are proportional to time) go through 3600, and multiples thereof, in the given periodic time. Either the process or the result is spoken of as an harmonic analysis.· Each such term is called an harmonic component, component tide, partial tide, simple tide, or simply a coniponent. The (uniform) hourly change in the angle of any component is called its .~peed; the value of its angle reckoned from its high water at any given mstant is called its phase; its (constant) semirange is called its a111plit1ide; the (constant) angular retard of the maximum of any component 0 behind its astronomical cause or fictitious moon (as assigned by the uncorrected equilibrium theory in Part II) is its epoch or la.g. Tho amplitude of 0 will be denoted by O, the epoch by 0°, and the speed by c. If 0 have a period of approximately one day or twenty-four hours, it is said to be diurnal and is written C1 ; if it have a period of approximately twelve hours, it is said to be semidinrnal and is written Ci, and so on. At most places the semidiurnal compo11e11ts are so much larger than the diurnals, quarter diurnals, etc., that the tide curve of any particular day approximates toward a sine (or cosine) curve whose period is about twelve lunar hours. In the analysis of tidal currents 0 !\nd oo may be replaced by 0 and iJo, C denoting the amplitude of the component velocity and (Jo/c being the interval between the transit. of the fictitious moon (Table 3) and maximum velocity. The principal lunar component, denoted by M2, has an hourly speed of 28°·984 1042, and so its period is a half lunar day. The principal solar component, denoted by Si, has an hourly speed of 30°·000 0000, and so its period is a half solar day. The luni:solar diurnal component, denoted by K 1, has an hourly speed of 15°·0410 686, and so its period is a sidereal day. The principal luna.r diurnal component, denoted 0 1, has an hourly speed of 13°·943 0356, and so its period exceeds the lunar day by the same amount as the period of K 1 falls short of it. For a more extended list of components see§§ 15-18, Part II, and Tables 1, 36.

In this way he could pick out the overtones which were present in the note sounded.

12. The velocity (drift) of a current is the rate at which the fluid particles move horizontally. It is usually expressed in knots, i. e., uautical miles per hour, but sometimes in teet per second.· The velocity generally differs for different depths, but its value at the surface may be understood unless otherwise specified. The velocity of propagation of the tidal wave is m~ny times greater than the velocity of the current, and the two must uot be confounded. The direction (set) of a current is the direction or point of the compass toward which the fluid particles move. The movement of the fluid in one direction, usually inland, is styled.flood, and in the opposite direc~ion, ebb. The two are not always distinct, and, even if they are, it is not always possible to know which movement should be taken for the tlood and which for the ebb. Flow or flood and ebb correspond to the French ftot and jusant, while rise and fall correspond to montant or gagnaut and perdant. The maximum of the flood or ebb current is sometimes called the strength of jlood-0r ebb. The effect of the tidal wave in giving rise to currents is obvious in two extreme eases: (1) Where there is a small tidal basin connected with the sea by a large opening. (2) Where there is a large tidal basin connected with the sea by a very small opening. In the first case the velocity of the current in the opening will have its maximum value when the tide or height of sea is changing most rapidly, i. e., at a time about mid way between high and low water. In other words, the water level in the basin keeps at about the same level as the surface of the water outside. Flood corresponds to the rising and ebb to the falling tide. In the second case the velocity of the current in the opening will have its maximum value when it is high water or low water without; for then there is the greatest head of water for prodncing motion. Flood begins al>out three hours after low water and ebb begins about three hours a.fter high water, and so slack water occurs at times about midway between the tides. Many currents in nature lie, in a general way, between these two extreme cases; but see §22. Slack water denotes the state of the current when its velocity becomes a minimum. It folJows high- or low-water stand by intervals ranging from zero to three hours, depending upon the locality.t Ohange or turn of tide are expressions sometimes used instead of "slack water." The velocity aud direction of tidal currents are much modified by extremely local causes, while the times and heights of the tides are about the same over considerable areas. 13. Representation of currents, etc. The velocity a11d direction of a current at any given time are often indicated by an arrow. Usually the arrow indicates direction only, the velocity being written just beyond the point. If the curreuts corresponding to several phases of the tide, or rather tidal current, are shown upon one sheet, several arrows will usually radiate from the same point upon the map. Their numbers indicate the order of occurrence.t A current station is a point where currents have been observed. Unll.\ss the station happeus to be in the channel, it is obvious that the rising tide will generally reach and swell the water in the channel before its effoet is felt at the station. Similarly the falling tide begins to lower in the channel earlier than in the shallower regions. Bence the order, in time, for the pointing of the radiating· arrows isShoreward, upstream, offshore, downstream. This is evidently clockwise for stations upon the right-hand bank (looking downstream) and counter clockwii:!e for stations upon the left. For au instantaneous represent.1tion of the condition of the currents in a given harbor or region it is customary to make use of lines of jlow. A line of flow is such a line that at all of its points the motions of the fluid particles coincide with it. In other words, if we draw at each point of the fluid a very short arrow, whose direction indicates the direction of the current at the given instant, then a curve, coinciding with a series of them, is a line of flow.§ At any given -------------------····· ··---···-------*To change velocities given in feet per secoml to knots por hour, multiply !Jy 45 =0·5921= 1 ; to 11t11tuto 76 l ·689 rniles, multiply by~~t Etales de jlot et de jusant vs. eta lea de pleinc 111er et de baase 111e1·. t Por examples see Coast Survey charts, 1il110 tho Reports; for instanco 1879, opp. p. 175 and p. 181. §A set of charts for the Irish Sea and English Channel, by Beechy (q. v.), is given in tho Pililosophical Transactions for 1848.

instant the motion of surface of the water will be represented by a system of curves covering it.
If the motion be steady, i.e., independent of the time, lines of tlow are usually known as stream

lines.
If across the lines of flow we draw a line cutting the system everywhere at right angles, the line is a line of equal velocity potential, or an equipotential line. We may assign to one such line any number we please; but having done so, the numbers belonging to other such lines become fixed. Suppose the numbers upon two adjacent lines of equal velocity potential to diffor by a small constant quantity drp. The distance apart of the two lines (ds) becomes known when the velocity is known (and conversely) t.hrough the equation

or

ds =-d<f>+ v,

(13)
Lines of equipotential form a f!!ystem of curves cutting the system of lines of flow everywhere at right angles. \Vhen the motion is steady and the body of water uniform in depth, the two systems are not only orthogonal, but also isothermal; that is, if we construct stream lines and equipotential lines, as above directed, we can select stream lines as far apart as are the equipotential lines in the same vicinity, and BO divide the whole surface of the water into elementary squares. If the real part of a function of a complex variable represents one of these systems, the purely imaginary part will represent the other. Such a function is defined by the boundary conditions; that is, the function must be such that the stream lines coincide with the fixed boundaries of the fluid.· Another pair of systems which might be used to represent the motion of the water are lines of eq11al velocity and lines of equal bearing. All along a line of equal velocity, the velocity of a current is constant; all along a line of equal bearing the direction or set of the current is constant. These two sets of curves often intersect orthogonally or nearly so.· For uniform depth and steady motion the systems are also isothermal. The map of a body of water may have drawn upon it a series of lines, along any particular one of which the current turns at a given lunar hour. Such lines are called cocurrent lines; they are quite analogous to cotidal lines, and, like them, admit of numerous varieties. t If we are concerned with the current at one station only, the velocities may conveniently be taken as the (positive) ordinates of a curve, the times being the abscissrn. The directions may bo written at the feet of the ordinates. At a station where the flood and ebb are distinct, the velocities of the one may be taken as positive and the other negative. This representation is quite analogous to the tidal sheet or marigram. 14. For explaining the origin, propagation, and properties of the tide wave, numerous theories are required, according to the circumstances. When the explanation is less complete, or when observation is called in to supplement certain of its defects, the underlying and so-called theory is really only a working hypothesis. However, since nobody can hope for theories covering all cases, and since the same theory at one place may serve to explain the tides, while at another place it can serve only as a working hypothesis, we shall follow usage aud make the word "theory" cover the expression ''working hypothesis." The (uncorrected) equilibrium or statical theory assumes that at each instant the surface of tlie sea is a prolate elipsoid whose longest diameter points at the tidal body. This hypothetical surface is often defined as being one which is everywhere normal to the direction of gravity as perturbed by the tidal body alone. If the ocean covered the entire earth, the effect upon the direction of gravity of the layer of water constituting the hypothetical tide could be computed. The eccentricity of the equilibrium spheroid, and so the range of tide, would then be somewhat increased.

The corrected equilibrium theory differs from the former in assuming the earth not whoJly covered bJ water, and so the surface of even a deep sea cannot actually coincide with the spheroid of the uncorrected theory, but will be parallel to it the distance therefrom at any given point varying with time. This is necessitated by the incompressible property of water. The difference between these two theories can be illustrated by means of a small body of water, a lake, or even a pail of water. The uncorrected theory implies that the whole surface of' the small body of water rises and falls by the same amount, twice each lunar day. Moreover, this range of tide would be the same as the range of tide in the same latitude were the surface of the earth covered by an ocean. The corrected theory involves the fact tl1at, on the whole, the surface of the small body of water always has the ·same height, and so its tides are caused by the water at one side being slightly elevated while in another portion it is slightly depressed. But the surface is normal to disturbed gravity, or parallel to the uncorrected tidal spheroid. The cotidal lines will radiate from a no-tide point instead of being arcs of terrestrial meridians as in the case of the uncorrected theory. The equilibrium theories assume that the water surface arranges itself in each locality normal to the force of disturbed gravity, but they do not explain how this arrangement is made, nor whether it is possible with the known properties of water. They avoid altogether the question of depth of the water, the i,mrface alone being coni;;idered. I1aplace attempted a theory in which not only the disturbing or tidal forces, but also the motion of the water regarded as a heavy or inert body, are taken into account. Such theories are known as dynamic or kinetic. They should take account of the viscosity or interrlal friction of the water as well as the friction at the bounding surfaces. The wave theory considers the tide as. a wave and develops the properties of such motions. From the nature of the case it is a kinetic theory. The uncorrected equilibrium theory is useful as a working hypothesis in tidal analysis because it enables one to inter suitable forms of expression for the tidal disturbances, knowing the laws of the forces to which they are due. '.l.'he principle that the disturbances are coperiodic with the forces, whether the tide approach its equilibrium condition or not, is a deduction of dynamic::;. The corrected ·equilibrium theory applies to small, deep bodies of water. The kinetic theory enables one to infer that the amplitude of tidal oscillations having sensibly equal periods are to one another as are their forces, and that their epochs are equal. The wave theory is applicable to canals or tidal rivers.

l!i. Tu shallow estuaries where the range of tide is considerable, the high water is propagated inward faster than the low water, for at high water the greater depth prevails. The high water thus gaining upon the low water causes the duration of rise of tide to uecomc shorter as tht wave proceeds; and so the farther tbe wave goes without breaking, the more abrupt itH front becomei:;. Finally, it becomes so steep that the top of the wave falls forward (not in the middle of the stream but near the shelving shores) something like the crest of a breaker. This phenomenon, usually accompanied by much noise, is called a bore. Other names for the bore, boor, or uoar's hea<l are cager (Bngland), mascaret or barre (France), prororooa or pororoca (Brazil). The following rivers and arms of the sea have bores: .r.rhe Amazon;· Tsien-ta11g,t Brahmaputra, Ganges, Hooghly, Indus, Garonne, Dordogne, Seine, Trent, Severn, and Wye rivers, Solway Frith; arms or bays at the bead of the Bay of Fundy, and perhaps Magellan Strait and Cook Iulet.f An agucr is a doubl~·headed tide; that is, a tide having two maxima or two minima instead of the usual high or low water.§ This gives to the tide a long "stand," and so may be of much practical value. At Southampton there is a double high water, at Portland a double low water,

and at Havre an almost double bigh water.· Tbis peculiarity of the tide does not generally persist throughout the lunation. It is usually, but not always, the most pronounced at spring tide. At some places the high and low waters may be very sharp, thus making a staud of short duration. The bigh waters at Ipswich aud the low wa.ters at Philadelphia may be mentioned as cases of this kind. t Whenever the tidal water has to pass through a rather narrow or shallow channel to fill a tidal reservoir beyond, a strong current is necessitated. This is sometimes called a race; e.g., tbe Hace at the eastern entrance to J,ong Island Sound. Of course each of the two bodies of water connected by the strait may be tided; e. g., the Hell Gate, ::\fossina Strait. But a tidal race is more properly defined as a stroug current caused by the meetiug of two wave systems from different or opposite directious. The effect will be the grnatest where the range of tide is most diminished by this meeting; that is, at a place where trough meets crest, n,s (:an be seen by a brief study of the water particles in wave motion (Chapter II). '.rhe Portland Hace, the Maelstrom, and Seymour Narrows may be instanced. 16. Seicltes (sash) are short-pel'iod oscillations (u:mally from about 10 to 60 minutes) existing at times in many (if not all) lakes and landlocked bays. They represent oscillatfous in which usually the whole body of the liquid swings to an'l fro. They are eaused by sudden changes of atmospheric pressure, or winds which sweep over its surface. The period of such a seiche is twice length of lake

where ,Q denotes the acceleration due to gravity, and It the depth of the lake or bay. Seiches may not alwa.ys be uniuodal, as suppofled above, nor docs the nodal line always run transversely to the body of water. This phenomenon has been observed on Lakes Geneva, Oonstance, Ontario, Michigan, Cazenovia (N. Y.), and others; on bays in India; at Swansea (Wales), Malta (Greece), and Bristol (It. I.). l The effect of an earthquake upon the sea is known as an earthquake wai,e, an earthquake sea (or ocean) wave, or a g1·eat sea wave. The last term serves to distinguish it from the corresponding oscillation in the solid earth which is known as a great cm·th wa1,e. The great sea wave may somt·times, perhaps, be due to a tumbling down of submarine cliffs instead of to an earthquake proper. 'l'he effoct of these waves is often transmitted to distm1t shores, where it is recognized (although not always with absolute certainty) by the peculiar oscillations which it adds to the record of an automatic or self-registering tide gauge. Peru, Japan, and l\Ialay Archipelago have furnisl1ed notable instances of this phenomenon.

DIGRESSION ON PLANE, OR TWO-DIMENSIONAL, WATER WAVES.

17. Fundamental cr1icatio1rn.

A more exhaustive account of fluid motion will be given in Part IV. Ju the present cliapter the assumptions made are few and simple. 'l'he main o~ject is to give au introduction to tlie stu1ly of wave motion,· which shall clearly indicate how the wate1· particles behave accordiug to theory, and whicli shall also show some applications of the results obtained to the water movements in nature. By taking the displacement equations (26), (27), aud the equation (28) for granted, several of the paragraphs on wave motion can be understood without rea<ling the present paragraph. In any motiou or a tluid, the entire volume taken into consideration must not he altered. 'l'hat is, if we assume any small mass of the ftuitl bouuded hy an imaginary surface to be slightly displaced in the motion, its volume will remain as before; or if we assume au imag-inary surface fixed in the Huid and inclosing a small mass or volume of it, the amount. contained in this surfaee will be constant, whatever the motion of the tluid, provi<lcd only that the surface remain eutirely submerged. \Ve shall assume that all motions take place in or parallel to the vertical plane .ry, and, for convenience, that the thickness (z) of the &oily of water treated is unity. 'l'hen, considering an imaginary rectangular boundary whose edg-es are d.c, dy, in length, all(l letting 11, 1' denote velocities along- x, y, the difference between the entire quantit.y flowing into arnl out of this bow1dary which is supposed to be stationary is, obviously,

In using this equatio11 it is to be remarked that a:, y are the true coordinates of the particle, whereas in the work about to he given x, y are the coordinates of the particle when ill its nudisturbed condition. 'l'he true coordiuates are .r + x, y + y.

In this integration it is allowable to take the upper limit as h, instead of the slightly different value h + 17, because the vertical acceleration ~~is assumed to be a moderately small quantity.· If X = o, the motion of the body is "free," not "forced;" i.e., the body is Jeft' to itself. If the vertical acceleration can be omitted, the water must so move as to keep all particles which lie in a given vertical line, always in a vertical line. If the area be divided into elementary vertical strips of length dx and height h + 17, the elementary volume of water, <lx x (h + 17) x 1, varies with the instantaneous height; and so the force equivalent to the effective force in the moving element must likewise vary,

WAVES IN A CANAL OF UNIFORM DEPTH AND INDEFINlTB LENGTH.

18. It is here proposed to give an interpretation of the wave motion defined by the following equations, and to point out how the long or tidal wave differs from the short, oscillatory, or surface wave. . Let us assume that the horizontal and vertical displacements of the fluid are of the respective forms, t (26) x = .!l cot1h ly sin (at - l.i· +a) (27) y =A sinh ly cos (at - l.r +a),

wllere A, a, a, l are constant throughout the canal and for all time; x, y are independent of the time but vary from point to point, .i: being measured hori;:outally from an arbitrary origin, and y Yertically from the bottom of the canal.

Equations (17), (22) imply that x and y are small in comparison with the wave's length and the depth of the water, respectively. The motion defined by (26), (27) is periodic in time and distance. Any increase of time, accompanied lJy a proper increase of distance, leaves x, y unaltered, showing that tlie wave motion represented advances uniformly along .v increasing, the velocity being~· The motion represented is evidently such that similar terms involving 2at, 3at, etc., may be disregarded.

19. Deductions from (26), (27). The horizontal and vertical component oscillations (displacements) of any given fluid particle are each simple harmonic functions of the time, and of like periods. Eliminating the angle involving t, we have x2 y2 A 2 cosn:r-zy +.AYsiriliTfy=l, (30) showing that auy particle whose (undisturbed) height above the bottom is y describes an ellipse whose major and minor semi-axes are A cosh ly aud A sinh ly. Com~equently the foci are distant A../ cosli2ly..:.:: -sirih2-ly, =A, -from the center of the ellipse. As tllis distance is independent of both x and y, it is the same for the orbit of a.ny particle in the fluid mass; i. e., the two foci of any ellipse are 2A apart and lie in a horizontal line. [It may be noted, although it is not important for the present purpose, that the law of description is precisely the same as that of a body revolving about a central force whose intensity increases directly with the distance of the body from the center.] Let x be constant in equatiom1 (26), (27). Since the angle at - lx + a does not involve y, it is obvious that particles originally in the snme vertical line are, at any given instant, in the same pl1ase of either the vertical or the horizontal oscillation (displacement). In this respect the motion of a vertical :filament of water somewhat resembles that of a stalk of wheat swaying to and fro in the wind.

20. Figure 2 illustrates the wave motion in a vertical section of "'ater, the wave being propagated in the direction Ox. This is not a view of a three dimensional volume of water, but consists of a series of instantaneous views of the same plane; the times at which the views are supposed to be taken are, as indicated upon an arbitrary time axis t, o, 1, 2, and :3 seconds, respectively. The orbit of any given particle is fixed; i. e., is the same for all values of t; but the particle itself occupies different positions as t varies. In other words, it describes tho orbit and iu the direction (clockwise) indicated by the arrow. The orbits which are sufficiently far from the bottom to be shown in the figure, are, very nearly, circles. Tho wavy line having its axis parallel to the t-axis is a view showing how the height of the surface (at x=O) changes as t varies. In otho1· words, it is a view of what- would be traced upon a self-registering apparatus at the locality x=O.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC 8URVEY.

Of course, the scale in which time along the t-axis is reckoned is arbitrary. The instantaneous wave profiles are the wavy lines parallel to tlie x-axis; they approximiite closely to curves known as curt.ate cycloids. To obtain such a curve, let a series of circles be uniformly distributed along a horizontal line; take a point on ea~h a constant angular distance from the position of the point on the adjacent circle to the left, say; join the points thus obtained. fn order that the cycloid be 'curtate, it is necessary that the common distance between the centers of the circles be greater than the arc subtending the constant angular distance just referred to. The wavy line parallel to the t-axis differs from the '\Vave profiles only that the abscissm may be drawn to a different scale. 21. Let us now return to equations (2u), (27). If in these two equations we assume two of the coordinates t, x, y to be constant while one is variable, equations (2u), (27) are the two equations of a displacement curve, the non-constant coordinate being the variable parameter. (Or, if we elirninattl this variable parameter, an equation in x, y is obtained.) This locus must be such that if we proceed along the t-, x-, or y-axis, as the case may be, the successive displaced particles must fall upon it; the (:x, y)-origin is supposed to coincide with the undisturbed position of any particle along the axis in question. By supposing t aud .r constant, equations (2u), (27) represent an hyperbola; or, eliminating y, we obtain the single equation x2 yz (31) --·-------·-- ----·---------=l. A 2 sin 2 (at-l:v+ a) A 2 cos2 (at-lx+a) By suppo,;ing y and t constant, equations (26), (27) represent an ellipse. As x increases the ellipse is described counterclockwise. These equations likewise represent au ellipse when y and x are constant. As t increases the ellipse is described clockwise. In either case the resultant equation is

:Now regarding x (or t) as the parameter of a system of curves, equation (31) represents a system of confocal hyperbolas-the foci being 2A asunder. Similarly regarding y as the parameter, equation (32) represents a system of confocal ellipsc8. These ellipses and hyperbolas are bi-confocal and constitute a pair of orthogonal and h;othermal systems. When the ellipses are circlei;:, the hyperbolas become radiating straight lines. To see the system of displacement ellipses (circles) in the figure, drop all orbits which are in the same vertical line to the bottom of the canal; they will then have a common center. 'fhe nearly vertical line joining any originally vertical series of particles becomes an hyperbola (radial line) cutting the ellipses (circles) at right angles. [If we put :r' =at- l.c +a, .11' = ly, ::' = x' + iy', Z = x + -i y, then (2u), (27), are equivalent to the sing-le equation

Z =A sin::'

But if the tc' y' plane or the x y·plane be divided into a system of squares by means of lines parallel to the coiirdinate axes, they become in the x y-plane by the transformation (33), the confocal system of ellipses and hyperbolas already des~ribed.] 22. A wave whose length is several or many' times the depth of the water, is called a long wave. Such waves form a limiting case of wave-motion iu water defined by the displacem<>nts (26) and (27).

From (34) we see that, to quantities of the second order, the horizontal displacements are the' same for all depths of the liquid inasmuch as y is not involved. That is, the water must move to and fro as if divided up into vertical slices. The expression for y shows that the vertical dis placemen ts increase as the distance from the bottom increases. 'l'lle orbits of the particles are the extremely elongated ellipses having as their equation
(36)

They have a constant major axis at all depths, but the minor is proportional to the depth taken. At tho surface the amplitude (17) of the rise and fall (tide) is lh times the amplitude of horizontal displacement (curreut). The vtlocity of the fluid particles is

as follows from (28), (34), and (35). Example.- ·when tbe height of the (rising) tide from mean water level is 2 feet, in a long tidal river 30 feet deep, the velocity is 2 x

~-~or 2·07 feet per second (flood).

'l'he maximum flood velocity occurs at the time of high water, and the maximum ebb velocity at the time of low water. Slack water occurs at the time of mean water level. From Fig. 2 it is readily seen that tbe particles of water in a wave surface may, at certain portions of the wave pel'iod, be actually flowing up hill. This is one of the most obvious ways of detecting wave motion. Experience shows that the motion of tl1e water in tidal riyers which are not abruptly termin. ated, is well represented by the wave motion here considered. For in such cases reflection can alter the wave but slightly. If two waves of like perio(ls and moving in opposite directions be superposed, the result will depend upon the manner of the incidence. If high water falls upon high water tlie range of the wave will be increased, while the velocity of tl1e current may be reduced to almost zero (see Fig. 2). For, the particles at high water iu each wave move in the direction of wave propagation, mul so the resultant motion is perhaps zero. If a high water fall upon a low water, the range of the wave may be almost reduced to zero while the current will have its velocity increased. vVest, of the Isle of Man the cotidal hour is about ten, whether the tide comes from the north or from the south. The consequence is that the velocity of the current is smaJI. 23. a denotes the number of degrees by which the phase of the component displacements of auy particle is altered in a unit of time. vVhen tbe orbit of the particle is circular, a denotes its angular velocity.

low water at the assumed time. To see how the horizontal projections of fluid particles are crowded together (like a condensation of a sound wave) at the high waters, and drawn apart at the low waters, we may even make use of Fig. 2. Take the front row of surface particles and project them upon the x.axis, remembering that the displacements (~) must be reganled as small in comparison with the length of the wave. · 28.

This can l>e easily seen because the reflection is really due to the horizontal motion. x., y, beiug simple harmonic displacements of the same periods as x, y, they combine with the latter to alter the phase of the wave at a given time and place (cf. §D). Let us now suppose a complete reflection to take place so that the amplitude of tl~e reflected portion should, if conditions permitted, be as great us the amplitude of the original wave.

From these we Ree that for all values of x, e and y or 17 are simple harmonic functions of the time; their amplitudes, however, depend upon the value given to x. -Throughout the canal the tide rises and falls simultaneously; in like manner, it ebbs and flows. Moreover, it is shwk water throughout the canal at the time fJf high or low water. If lL = 900, or any other orhl multiple of i ZA, the value of 17 becomes very great, especially as x approaches L, while for the even multiples it becomes zero for all values of t. A. is the length of a free tidal wave in a canal not obstructed by a barrier; when expressed in angular measure, ll is, of course, 2 7r or 3600. The average depth of the Bay of Fundy along its axis is 40 or 50 fathoms. Table 50 gives about 800 statute miles for the corresponding;\. .·. ! A. is about 200 miles. Now it happens that the length of the bay is about 150 miles, so that these particular dimensions may in part account for the large tides near its head.· But the wave progresses at about the rate due to depth according to Lagrange's formula, and so it is reasonable to suppose that the effect of the barrier is scarcely felt because of the gradual shoaling iu the uifper part of the bay. The Gulf of Maine, whose length inward is about 200 miles and whose depth about 75 fathoms, is, by Table 50, nearly ! A. in length. Hence the stationary character of the wave and the increase in range. t Portland Canal, forming a part of the boundary between .Alaska and British America, furnishes a good illustration of a nearly stationary wave. Its width and depth are quite uniform and its termination is sudden. Simultaneous observations show that the tide at Somerville Bay is simulta11eous with the tide at Halibut Bay, 30 miles farther up the canal. Also that the tide at Ford's Cave, uO miles above Somerville Bay, is but five minutes later. Now the depth of the canal is about 12.3 fathoms on an average along its axis, and so the time required for a wave to be transmitted uO miles would be about half an hour, instead of five milrntes. The range of tide is nearly constant, being on an average 13 or 14 feet. For a depth of 125 fathoms A. =about 1 300 miles, Table 50. 31. Forel's seiche period. Let it now be required to find the period in which a body of water, as a lake, whose length is 2L and whose depth is It, will swing when disturbed from its position of equilibrium by a sudden vertical force acting near either end, or a loagitudiual horizontal force acting upon intermediate points. Taking the middle point as origin, either half may be treated as a caual closed at one end, and affected at the mouth with a periodic disturbance whose period is determined by its length and depth. y..r e have just seen that L shoulcl be ! 7t, in order to bring about the greatest rise and fall at the closed end. But the wave-length and depth being fixed, the periodic time becomes fixed by the equation A (63)

It is an easy matter to test this formula experimentally. Suppose we have a rectangular tray of water 2£ inches in length and h inches in depth. Now, suddenly raise one end or otherwise

Tlle free wave immediately traverses the length of tlte tray, returns, sets out again, and so continues to go back and forth until the equilibrium is gradually restored. Next, supposo that as soon as the wave returns to the end of the tray where it was produced a similar disturbance is repeated. The wave will this time set out increased in size. I~et the slight disturbance be repeated periodically, according to the period thus determined, until finally the water simply swings, as it were, there being no progressive character of the motion to be seen. Formula (64) gives the period of the oscillation ill seconds, provided we express gin inches (= 386). Of course the period will generally be altered when the depth ceases to be uniform. Ferrel's explanation t of the abnormally large semidinrnal tides of the North Atlantic Ocean is based upon the fact that a tray or canal closed at both ends, extending from Burope to .America, having the average depth of the ocean along the parallel of about 52° north, would have about

Possibly the periods of free oscillation of certain zones of the Pacific have considerable influence upon the size of the diurnal oscillations in tllat ocean. It is possible that component tides, whose periods are some fractions like~'!, ;f, ··· of a half tidal day, may be due in part to stationary oscillations of the kind just referred to; that is, they may owe their size to the length and depth of tile body of water in which they occur, rather than to the water being so shallow that the range of tide is a considerable fraction of the depth. 32. Returning to equations (61), (62), we have

This shows that if the middle points of all the rectilinear paths be placed at one point, the extremities of these paths will define an ellipse.

For different values of y the major axis of the ellipse will remain uualtercd, uut the minor will Lie proportional to the depth taken.

That the velocities of the fluid particles inherent in the wave motions do not account for the currents in East River, appears from the fact that at two hours before high water at Governors hlaml, the current off Old Ferry Point (a fow miles west of Willets Point) is flowing westerly at the rate of 1·5 knots, which is nearly its maximum value at that place. In the Lower Hudson, off Thirty-ninth street, the maximum velocities are about simultaneous with the tides at Oovernors Island, as the theory of wave propagation in an iudefinite canal would require. Two l1011rs before high water the velocity is small (0·7 knots) and in a northerly <lirectiou. Now, had the wave been propagated up .East River in a similar manner the Yelocity would be small at this hour. As a matter of fact it has very nearly its maximum value throughout the narrow portion~ of the river. Moreover, it can not be due to the wave motion from the east, because off Old Ferry Poi11t the velocity is small and in an opposite direction. Thus it is seen that the rapid currents of East IUver, and particularly around Blackwells Island, are not due to the superposition of two horizontal motions of tbe water as in si111ple wave motion, but to tbe rlifforence in head between New York Bay and the western portion of Long Island Sound."'

CHAPTER III.
ON THE ORIGIN OF TIDES.

38. In the preceding chapter, the tide wave has been regarded as an existing phenomenon without special reference to its astronomical cause. It is proposed to here briefly consider the origin of the tide nnder several conditions. This will indicate some of the difliculties with which a general theory has to contend in the case of nature . .All particles of the earth (including the seas) will occupy positions fixed relatively to one another if no other forces act upon them than the following: the earth's attraction, its centrifugal ·force of axial rotation, and an extraneous force acting upon all of its particles alike. If the extraneous force does not act upon all particles alike, then motions will be set up in the yielding parts. Suppose the earth to consist chiefly of a spheroidal nucleus either rigid throughout or rigid in its outward layers. Suppose this nucleus to be covered in whole or in part by one or more seas either shallow or not, in comparison with the earth's radius. The attraction of the moon upon any given particle near the surface, say, is along a line drawn (at any given instant) from the particle to the moon's center; its intensity, which is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, and local direction (i. e., direction with respect to the earth's surface) continually change as the earth rotates upon its axis. The attraction of the moon upon a particle at the earth's center is along a line drawn from the earth's center to that of the moon; its intensity is independent of the earth's axial rotation. 'l'he difference between these two forces may be called the tide-p1·oducing force at the surface point in question. Just what this force will do to the water as the earth rotates upon its axis, cannot be clearly seen except for very special cat:!es. This force being very small in comparison with the earth's attraction, its vertical component, which slightly alters the intensity but not the direction of terrestrial gravity, cannot set up in seas shallow in comparison with the earth's radius any considuable motion amongst the fluid particles. The horizontal component of the tide-producing force may, however, impart a sensible horizontal motion to the waters of au extended sea, and, because the fluid is incompressible and continuous within a given basin, indirectly create a slight rising and falling of the surface, whether or not the period of the earth's axial rotation were sufficiently long to enable the surface to approach a level surface; i. e. to arrange itself normal to disturbed gravity at each point. 39. The tide-producing force. The system of arrows in Figs. 3, 4, and 5 are intended to represent the horizontal component of the moon's tide-producing force at various places on the earth's surface. The arrows located upon the same small circle (isodynamic line) are supposed to be of equal length, and all arrows are supposed to lie in a system of great circles which meet in a point directly under the moon and, of course, in a point 180° therefrom. .At these two points the length of the arrows is zero; for, the horizontal component of the moon's disturbing force must there vanish-the force itself being vertical. T.he length of the arrows is likewise zero along a great circle midway between these two points; for, all points along this circle are very nearly as far from the moon as is the earth's center. The system of arrows is fixed with respect to the moon, and so sweeps over the surface of the earth as the moon performs her apparent daily revolution, or shifts somewhat as she declines north or south from the celestial equator. At any point P 011 the earth's surface, the moon being upon the equator, the horizontal forces are equal in magnitude and direction to the horizontal forces at P', a point upon the same parallel of latitude as P, but 180° distant in longitude; or, what amounts to the same thing, they repeal; themselves at any given point P every half lunar day. But when the moon is not upon the equator, the forces are not generally the same at P and P', either in magnitude or in direction, and so do not exactly repeat themselves every half lunar day. This alternation of the forces gives rise to a diurnal inequality in the tides. 6584-.-23 353

It will be noticed that for places situated upon either side of the equator, the forcP.s have, when the moon is upon the equator, a meridional compouent directed from the poles toward the equator, and that this component never points from the equator toward the poles; consequently the existence of the moon causes the water (half-tide level) at the equator to be higher than it would otherwise have been (cf.§ 47). The moon's movement in declination causes a fortnightly fluctuation in half-tide level. The magnitude of the tide-producing force can be shown graphically by means of the following obvious construction:· Let M denote the moon, or its mass; .B, the earth's center, or the earth's mass; P, any point whose distance is p from E; r, the distance EJ.lf, and D, the distance PM.

where m 2 is 0·000 1405 radian per second, instead of 28·9S4 degrees per 110ur. This gives 137 feet for the maximum excursion of a particle at the equator east or west from its mean position, due to the moon. In order to see that the vertical force can have little or nothing to do with the tides, Jet us suppose that, in a sea of uniform depth, the density of the water be increased or decreased from place to place in such proportions as the force of gravity is altered by the vertical disturbiug force of the moon. But the extreme variation in density over the globe would then be ouly 0·000 000 ms. And so, returning to the consideration of water of constant density, it follows that the extreme variation in the height of the free surface of a sea of uniform depth would be but a 0·000 000 ms part of the depth. 'fhe vertical force being generally about the same magnitude as the horizontal, and acting uearly perpendicularly to the free surface of the fluid, cannot create a horizontal motion comparable with that created by the horizontal force. The deviation of the plumb line is evidently due wholly to the horizontal force. It is supposed to be practically independent of the depth or mass of the water, the topography of the continents, etc. Any surface normal to the disturbed plumb line is a level su1face. If a liquid surface coincide with au instantaneous level surface, while the latter undergoes changes, the forces responsible for the behavior of the liquid must be horizontal and not vertical. 40. A small but not extremely shallow body of water. In this case the motion of the fluid hardly need be eonsirlered. The only thing necessary to be done is to find at any given instant how the direction of terrestrial gravity-that is, the direction of the plumb line-is perturbed because of the moon's attraction, and to then assume that the instantaneous surface of the water is perpendicular to this direction.

856

UNITED STATES COA8T AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The direction of the plumb line at a given place, but for the presence of a tide-producing body, would remain fixed with respect to the solid earth, although the latter rotate upon its axis. In general, the horizontal component of the moon's tide-producing force will cause the plumb bob to deviate slightly from its undisturbed position. The point of suspension of the plumb line being fixed with respect to the earth's nucleus, cannot be altered with respect thereto, no matter what the tide-producing force may be. But the plumb bob is acted upon by the tide-producing force for the particular place (which is the difference in the moon's attraction for this place and for the earth's center) and is free to move horizontally. This' force combined with the force of terrestrial gravity shows the deviation in the direction of the plumb line. If the surface of a small body of water arrange itself normal to the disturbed plumb line, it must perform two similar oscillations each lunar day when the moon is on the equator. The tides in such a body are necessarily small because this deviation of the plumb line is only 0"·017 (= 0·000 000 084 radian) either way from its mean position. When the moon is not upon the equator, the tide-producing force at a given time differs somewhat from the force twelve lunar hours before or after. For this reason the two high waters and the two low waters of a day will generally be somewhat unequal. The Levant, or part of the Mediterranean Sea east of Sicily, can be taken as an illustration. It extends approximately east and west about 1100 miles, with a depth ranging from one to two thousand fathoms. [The velocity of a free wave in this depth is three or four hundred miles per hour, and so the surface can, as will be explained in §42, keep itself approximately perpendicular to the direction of perturbed gravity.] Because this sea is in not very high latitude, and extends approximately east and west, it should be high water on the coast of Syria about three hours before the moon's transit over the middle of the sea, and low water at Malta and the eastern coast of Sicily at the same time. In other words, it should be high water at the latter places about three hours after transit. These conclusions agree with the results of observation. The range at the ends should be roughly
11 000

x 5 280 x 0·000 000 084 = 0-5 feet,

which is somewhat smaller than observed values. Suppose that at the center of gravity of a lake's surface we draw a plane normal to the plumb line; it will cut the surface in a line which may be called a "line of strike" and whose direction is that in which the deviating force is zero. The deviating horizontal force acts in a direction (an azimuth) perpendicular to this line. The height of the tide at any instant, or the volume of water in an elementary area, will evidently be proportional to the distance of the given elementary area from this line. Therefore if the volume of water in the lake remain constant, the statical moment of the entire lake surface must be zero, and so the line must pass through the center of gravity as we have assumed. This point is evidently the point of no-tide. Being a point of no-tide, the times of high water are anything whatever; in other words, all cotidal lines radiate from this point. In ascertaining the tidal forces at such a point, only its latitude need be considered, and any diagram for the purpose will apply anywhere upon the same parallel, regardless of longitude. The horizontal deviating force is

In this way for a given value of o and of l, a set of force arrows radiating from the assumed noti<le point and equal to sin 2 ()can be constructed for various values of (¢ - l). Their heads will define a certain curve. To ascertain the height of the tide at any point, not too far distant, at a given lunar hour, compute or observe the value of sin 2 fJ on the force diagram; also ascertain the distance in feet from the given point to the line of strike (which is perpendicular to the force arrow); multiply these together and this product by 0·000 000 084; the result is the height of the tide in feet reckoned from the lake surface as it would be if no moon existed. The required distance can be conveniently ascertained by letting the given point and the no-tide point define the diameter of a circle. Then produce the force arrow until it meets tlie circumference. From this intersection to the given point is the distance required. To determine the time of l1igll or low. 'water, ascertain the point on the force curve where the normal is parallel to the diameter of the circle defined by the given point and the no-tide point. The hour-augle belonging to that force arrow is the angle required. Of course the time used in reckoning is that belonging to the longitude of the no-tide point. When o=O, the force curve is an ellipse whose equation is

(98)

where y is reckoned southward. In practice it is more convenient and accurate to make use of the horizontal disturbing force resolved into two directions (north-and-south, east-and-west). These are each developed, § 49, Part II, into semidiumal, diurnal, and long period terms with either constant or somewhat variable coefficients. The results obtained in § 49, Part II, or which may be obtained as above, for the tide at Duluth, Lake Superior, agree well with observed values. The computed equilibrium tides at Chicago and Milwaukee, Lake Michigan, have ranges considerably smaller than the observed values and their intervals are not as satisfactory as the interval obtained for Duluth. In fa.ct it seems that almost all bodies of water have portions of their coast lines where the range of tide is unreasonably large, indicating that a wave movement has been propagated over a sloping bottom. Tile tides of the Gulf of Mexico can be explained by aid of certain assumptions which are based upon observations. Assuming that the semidiurnal wave does not exist (or is very small) south of the Yucatan Channel, then there is no derived semidiurnal tide from that source. A cross-section of Florida. Strait is small in comparison with a cross-section of Yucatan Channel. The semidiurnal wave is not large in any portion of Florida Strait; and so from that source the Gulf can hardly have any considerable derived tide, the eastern part excepted. At Vera Cruz, wh~ch is near deep water, the observed interval (2h 49m) and range (0·4 feet) of the semidiurnal wave approximately agree with the theoretical values obtained by considering the Gulf a closed sea. In the northeastern portion of the Gulf which has broad shallows, the range of tide is greatly increased. At Port Eads, near the mouth of the Mississippi River, the range is nearly zero as we might expect it to be, on account of the proximity of the no-tide point. Now observation shows that the diurnal wave does exist south of the Yucatan Channel. The latter being broad and deep, permits enough water to enter the Gulf to raise its whole surface almost simultaneously. Observation shows that the tropic high-water interval of the diurnal wave for Gulf stations is generally between 19 and 22 hours, while the tropic range of the diurnal wave is generally between 1 and 2 feet. 41. An hypothetical equatorial canal of 1iniform depth sm-rounding the earth. The present illustration is given for the purpose of showing that the surface of the sea does not of necessity arrange itself normal to the plumb line as disturbed by the moon; and here also it is necessary to consider the force tendilig'to deviate the same, that is, the horizontal component of the moon's tide producing force. All particles of the canal in the hemisphere toward the moon have imparted to them horizontal accelerations, urging them toward a point of the canal where the moon is on the meridian. All particles in the other hemisphere are at the same time urged toward a point 180° distant in longitude. There is no acceleration (east or west) at these two points, or at points 90° distant wllere the moon is in the horizon. Consequently, at any given

358

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

place, from moonrise to upper local transit., the acceleration is eastward, because the particle is continually approaching the moon; from transit to moonset the acceleration is westward; from moonset to lower transit it is eastward; and from lower transit to moonrise it is westward. Now, if the fluid be heavy and frictionless, the maximum eastward velocity will occur after all the eastward acceleration has been imparted, that is, at lunar noon or midnight; the greatest westward velocity, at moonrise or moonset; and zero velocity at the third, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-first lunar hours. All the time from moonrise till transit, more water flows toward the east than enters from the west at a given place, because the particles of moving water are continually acted upon by a force imparting to them an eastward acceleration. The reverse is true from transit to moonset. Similarly for the other half of the lunar day. During one of these periods the tide must be continually falling, and during the other continually rising. Low and high waters occur at the close of these periods, that i:::1, at the transits and when the moon is in the horizon. The tides having a fixed position with respect to the moon, it follows that the wave-form travels westward around the earth twice during each lunar day. Of course even the horizontal displacements of the fluid particles are small in comparison with the earth's radius. But it is obvious that if the wave-form advance westward, the orbital direction of the fluid particles must be such that the particles at high water are moving westward and at low water eastward; and so, as just stated, high water must occur when the moon is in the horizon, and low water when on the meridian. Let x denote the distance of the place east from the meridian of Greenwich, or x be its east a longitude (in radians); let a or arg 0 Mz denote twice the hour angle of the moon at the time t =0.

The amplitude of the tide in a shallow equatorial canal is therefore but a small fraction of a foot and is proportionate to the depth. The tide is evidently inverted since low water occurs when 2{} = 0°. When the depth is such that the free wave travels as fast as the moon or the forced tidal wave, then

It will be seen from § 47 that this value of 17 is equivalent to the tide of the equilibrium theory, H denoting the range of the lunar portion, which is about 1·8 feet. It is important to note that in a shallow canal (and no others exist on the earth) the displacements depend upon the period of the disturbing force, or the "speed" of the disturbing body. The greater the speed, the smaller the amplitude. Hence, the ratio of the amplitude cf the solar to that of the lunar tide ought to be leRs than the ratio as derived from the equilibrium theory. In nature this is generally found to be the case. It should also be noted that when friction is taken into account, not only does the amplitude or coefficient of the displacement depend upon the "speed" of the tidal body, but the angle or phase of the displacement does likewise depend upon it.t 42. The ti<les of the ooean do not produce a level surface. In order to be convinced that the instantaneous surface of a large. body of water cannot be a level surface, let us inquire what takes place when a vessel or trough of water is slightly disturbed-say slightly elevated at one end. If the disturbance be sudden, evidently a wave will be seen passing back and forth across the surface; finally it will disappear and equilibrium will be · restored. If the disturbance be gradual no wave may be noticeable, but equilibrium will be restored at each instant. Now suppose the trough to be so long that the gradual elevation and depression of one end of it takes place in a period of time less than the time required by the free wave to traverse its length. As long as the disturbance continues equilibrium cannot be restored. Hence it follows that the length of the trough and the depth of the water must be such that the free wave travels the length of the trough several times during the period of the disturbance if the surface is to remain nearly level. From this we conclude that the surface of an ocean cannot be a level surface, because too much time is required for the free wave to cross and recross-in other words, for the surface to arrange itself normal to the plumb line. For example, the period of the (semidaily) tidal forces is about equal to the time required for a free wave to be transmitted from Japan to California.. 43. Tidal observations have been confined to such portions of the sea as have comparatively small depths. For this reason it has seemed impossible to ascertain what actually takes place in

deep waters, causing the tides observed along the shores of continents and islands. If it slrnll become possible to detect, even roughly, the rising and falling of the tide at sea by means of the barometer,· this much-needed information will be supplied, and charts of cotidal lines may then be constructed with some degree of certainty. In case of a deep but small inclosed sea, the surface of the water undoubtedly keeps itself perpendicular to the direction of the earth's gravitational force as perturbed by the tidal body. In other words, the maximum excursions of fluid particles take place when the deviating force is a maximum. As already noted, this implies that for an equatorial lake or sea the surface is most inclined to its undisturbed level at the third hour before or after its semidaily transit across the no-tide meridian. At the third hour before the transit the eastern portion should have high water and the western low water, and vice versa for the third hour after its transit. It is reasonable to suppose that the particles which constitute a very large body of water, like an ocean, may have a tendency, because of their inertia, to reach their greatest displacements in a given direction not when the force acting in that direction becomes a maximum, but rather when the force in the opposite direction becomes a maximum or nearly so, as in the case of the equatorial canal already considered; for instance, extreme eastward elongation at a given place may for this reason occur about three hours after the time of the moon's transit across the local meridian. But, as shown in § 41, the range of tide in a self-returning equatorial canal is small in comparison with the range of tide in even a moderately large sea where the (corrected) equilibrium theory must still approximately apply. From this we are led to believe that in producing the tide the effect of the horizontal motion alone in a boundless shallow ocean is probably small. It is the boundary conditions (shores and bottom) which come in to enable the astronomical forces to pro· duce tides of considerable magnitude. In fact these conditions make an approximate equilibrium tide possible in a sea not too extended. Other effects of boundaries have been noted in §§ 30, 33. A large body of water approximately surrounded by lands and shoals is set into some kind of oscillation by the tide-producing forces. The manner in which it will be divided into vibrating masses by nodal lines depends upon the extent, shape, and depths of the body of water. Probably off the eastern and western boundaries would be found the greatest direct+ effect of this action, although right at the shores themselves the range of tide must generally be still greater, owing to the propagation of the free wave over shallow areas. Whether the eastern or western edge have the greater rise aud fall of tide will depend upon the bounding lands and shoals, also upon the extent of the water. If the tide at one point be considerably greater than that at others, the wave there generated may be propagated far as a free wave and partly control the positions of the cotidal lines.:j: In large oceans them may be traces of waves, which move westward at the rate of 3uoo in a lunar day. But whatever waves go to build up the tidei the combined effect probably makes cotidal lines generally real. In regard to latitude it may be said that direct equatorial tides should have large semidiurnal and small diurnal constituents. The semidiurnals should decrease as the latitude increases, and the diurnals increase up to latitude 450, after which they decrease. 44. If a bay communicates with the ocean, its tide is almost wholly derived from without. That is, a free wave is propagated up the bay, its velocity depending chiefly upon the depth of the water (§ 23). Numerous reflections from the sides and the head of the bay may be sufficient to alter the phase of the tide (at any given instant) somewhat, and so the velocity of the resultant crest. The same cause may likewise alter the amplitude. It is obvious that the corresponding reflections of the diurnal wave will not, m general, have the same accelerating or retarding effect upon its crest as had those pertaining to the semidiurnal. In such regions the type of tide may vary rapidly from point to point; that is, the diurnal and semidinrnal waves do not travel with the same velocity as is the case in a canal of uniform depth, the friction being for simplicity assumed to be zero. Speaking more generally, the particular form and size of a bay, in conjunction

with the fixed periods of the tides, govern or define its tidal movements or vibrations. For example, the Tidal Survey of Oanada has shown that the semidiurnal tides at St. Peters, Prince Edward Island, are about two hours earlier, and those at Miramichi Bay more than three hours earlier, than the tides at St. Paul Island at the entrance to the gulf. The statements made concerning the propagation of a wave up a bay, must not be taken too literally. The fact is that even if we have so simple a case as a sea or bay (whose own or direct tide is negligible) communicating with the ocean by one or more comparatively small and definite openings, and if at such mouths or openings the tides and currents are known from observation so that they could be predicted at any future time, we are, in the present state of our knowledge of wave motion, quite unable to predicate the motion in various parts of the sea or bay, although all depths and boundaries are known. It is probable that cases of this kind will sooner or later be attacked by mathematicians, and with some measure of success. Such considerations as the above, but more especially the fact of interference due to the water approaching from more than one direction, explain in part the great variety in the types of tid~ found in island regions. The reason why diurnal tides should succeed better than semidiurnals in passing barrier reefs, and therefore becoming conspicuous in island regions, is obvious. In fact, the shorter the period of the wave, the more a reef or other great obstruction will affect it; and this because the amount of water which passes it in the fl.ow and the ebb (the ranges being equal) increases when the length of the period is increased. A tide of long period and an almost complete barrier, so far as tides of short periods are concerned, serve to illustrate what is here intended. 45. Perhaps the only ocean region where the tide approaches its normal· form is the North Pacific Ocean. For, so far as the semidinrnal wave is concerned, both North and South Pacific form one region, and so there is no interfering from a neighboring region. The diurnal wave naturally becomes small as the equator is approached, and so the derived diurnal wave from the South Pacific can hardly be felt far north of the equator, where the direct diurnal wave is large. The western coast of America, the eastern coast of Japan, and perhaps the Sandwich Islands, seem to be most favorable localities for normal tides. Next to these regions is, perhaps, the eastern portion of South Pacific-say along the western coast of South America and around the southeastern islands of Polynesia. The East Indies naturally constitute the most complicated tidal region, and the West Indies probably come next. So far the type of tide has been governed by the size and position of the diurnal wave with respect to the semidiurnal wave, and these are quantities most subject to variation in short distances.t But when long distances are considered, the fact that each wave is composed of a solar as well as a lunar portion becomes important. The oscillations being of slightly different periods, it is easy to suppose (because the wave is generally neither direct nor derived, but in part both) that one oscillation may gain in phase somewhat upon the other, and that the ratio of the two amplitudes may vary. ln a region where there may be reflections or interferences of the tidal wave, the relative amplitudes and epochs of two oscillations of different periods must generally differ from point to point. The two portions of semidiurnal wave may thus follow their apparent causes (sun and moon) by different intervals in certain localities (thus causing the "age" to vary from point to point), and the ratio of their amplitude may likewise vary. So for the dimmal wave. This is substantially Laplace's+ explanation of how the speeds of components may alter their relative amplitudes and epochs. Airy§ found that with fewer assumptions fluid friction would accomplish a like result. It is probable that amplitude ratios and the ages of the corresponding inequalities depend upon both of these causes. Vague considerations like these lead to inferences like the following: Large diurnal or semidiurnal waves are approximately normal1 and small ones abnormal.

By large and small are here meant large and small in comparison with their equilibrium values, or e\·en in comparison with their values in the surrounding regions. Small ages indicate normal tides; large ages, abnormal.

CHAPTER IV.
GENERAL PROPERTIES OF TIDES AND MODES OF REDUCTION.

46. General properties of tides. Confining one's attention to a particular station, the following properties common to most tides are usually revealed by means of a fow days' observations: (1) Two high waters and two low waters occur during each twenty-four or twenty-five hours. (2) The alternate high or low waters are more or less unequal. (3) The heights of corresponding tides vary from day to day. (4) The lunitidal intervals (high or low water) are different for alternate tides. (5) The lunitidal intervals for corresponding tides vary from day to day. (6) The inequality in height or interval referred to in (2) or (4) becomes greater as the moon's declination, either north or south, increases. This does not apply, because of the sun's tidal effect, to the lesser inequality at stations where the high and low waters are affected by quite unequal amounts. . greater (7) The range of tide (as determined from all four tides of the day) is less than usual near

The equilibrium theory of tides.· The uncorrected equilibrium theory begins by assuming(!) That the nucleus of the earth is comparatively rigid (or that at least its outer layer is a rigid shell), and that it is composed of concentric spherical layers, each layer having a constant density. (2) That the nucleus is covered by a fluid of uniform depth, shallow as compared to the radius of the nucleus, but deep as compared to the rise and fall of tide. · (3) That this fluid has neither inertia nor viscosity, nor is there friction between the fluid layer and the nucleus or the enveloping atmosphere. As these conditions are far from being realized in the case of nature, observations will show at best only certain approximations toward ideal values. Before introducing the modifications

necessary to adapt the theory to the tides, it seems desirable to ascertain what the tendencies are in the ideal case. Since the angular velocity of the moon in her orbit and the rotary motion of the earth's surface are finite, while the particles of fluid are supposed to respond immediately to the forces acting upon them, we may consider the earth's surface as stationary during any given instant, and treat the surface assumed by the water as a case of static equilibrium. Because of hypothesis (1), the attraction of the moon upon the nucleus is the same as it would have been had the entire mass been concentrated at the earth's center. At any given place the tide-producing tendencies depend chiefly upon the distance and direction of the disturbing body, and are governed by what may be referred to as Laws I and II. Law I.-The tendency to produce tides at a given station varies directly as the mass of the disturbing body and inversely as the cube of the body's distance from the earth's center. In consequence of this law the amplitude of the solar tide ought to be about 0·458 times that of the lunar tide. For, the mass of the sun =331 000, and the mass of the moon= 1/81, the mass of the earth being unity, while the sun's distance= !.l2 800 000 miles and the moon's distance= 239 000 miles, so that solar tide: lunar tide= (92 800 000)3 : (~3!.l . · . solar tide= 0·458 lunar tide.

Law II.-The tendencies to produce tide for various relative positions of the tide-producing body are proportional to 3 COS2 e-1, (114) where ()is the zenith distance of the body corrected for parallax. In other words, {) is the angle at the earth's center' defined by the given station and the center of the disturbing body. If u denote the height of tide expressed in terms of the earth's radius, a, then it is proportional to 3 cos2 8-1, or equal to say a' (3 cos2 8-1). The equation of the surface of the sea at any given instant is (115) p=a (1 + u), or (116) p=a+a a' (3 cos 2 f}-1), which is the equation of an ellipsoid whose semiaxes are
a (1+2 a'), a (1- t.r'), a (1- a').
(117)

That is, forces acting according to this law cause the surface of the sea to assume the form of an ellipsoid of revolution whose longest axis points toward the tide-producing body. It will be observed that when the moon, say, is in the zenith (or nadir) the elevation of the sea is 2 a a' higher because of the existence of the moon; but when in the horizon, the elevation of the sea is a a' lower. ' For· a given place the height of the tide will vary from hour to hour of the day chiefly on account of the variations in (); but, as already noted, it varies somewhat on account of the variation in r, the moon's distance. For a given place the angle 8 depends upon the moon's ltour angle and its declination, both of which are functions of time. From spherical trigonometry, cos ()=cos

(i) The height of the semidiup1al portion of the lunar or solar tide at a given station is proportional to the cosine of twice the local hour-angle of the moon or sun multiplied by the square of the cosine of its declination. The factor depending upon the declination is always near unity. (ii) The height of the diurnal portion of the lunar or solar tide at a given station is proportional to the cosine of the local hour-angle of the moon or sun multiplied by the sine of twice its declination. 'fhe factor depending upon the declination varies almost directly with the declination. (iii) There is a portion of the lunar or solar tide which depends, at a g!ven station, wholly upon the declination of the moon or sun. The height of this portion is proportional to 3 sin2 o - I where o represents the declination of the moon or sun. The period of this expression is a half tropical month or year as the case may be. The height of the entire tide, or of the surface of the sea, at any given time and place is the sum of the six terms just referred to-three belonging to the moon and three to the sun.

where Rand E must be determined from observations at the given stations. Statements (i), (ii), and (iii) require no modification except that fur "hour-angle" we must write "hour angle ~iminished by a constant appropriate for the station in question" and so for "twice the hour angle". This correction is theoretically necessary (even if the water have neither inertia nor friction) because the earth's surface is not wholly covered with water, and the equation of continuity can not generally be satisfied when the rise and fall is as given by equation (119) unless we continually alter the plane of reference.

modification of taking o and r at times anterior to the time of tide. Such times, as well as the R's and t's, must be determined from observations made at the given station.· 48. Explanation of phenomena noted in§ 46 by the equilibrium theory. The tides in (i), § 47, are semidiurnal, while those in (ii) are diurnal. Each may, for any particular day, be represented by a cosine curve of proper length (period) and amplitude. Now, it is obvious that the superposition of a diurnal curve upon a semidiurnal, will, in general, cause the alternate maxima or minima of the semidiurnal curve to become more or less unequal in height and unequally displaced in time. These statements account for (1), (2), and (4) of§ 46. As 11oted in (ii), § 47, the amplitude of the diurnal curve (lunar or solar) is nearly proportional to the declination of the moon or sun. This explains property (6), § 46. The superposition of a semidiurnal curve or wave upon another of nearly equal period, but of greater amplitude, simply increases or decreases the amplitude of the latter when approximately like or opposite phases coincide; but when the phases differ by approximately 90° or 2700, the principal wave is displaced in time by the subordinate one-accelerated or retarded according as

the maximum, say, is 90° in advance or in retard of tlie maxima of the principal wave. This accounts for properties (3), (5), (7), and (9), § 46. Property (8) has been explained in§ 47 where the values of the perigean, apogean, and mean ranges are compared. This amounts to varying the a' or the R's inversely as the cube of the moon's distance from the earth's center. At a station where observation shows that R 1 is several or many times as great as R 2, expression (122), the number of maxima and minima of a curve composed of diurnal and semidiurnal parts will usually depend upon the number of maxima and minima of the diurnal part when the moon's declination is great; but when the moon is near the equator the number may be governed by the semidiurnal part. This accounts for properties [l] and [2], § 46. The moon crosses the equator and reaches its extreme declination at nearly the same points in the heavens as does the sun. This accounts for property [3]. A still more perfect form or expression for the equilibrium theory is obtained by developing the tide:producing potential (the principal part of which is inversely proportional to the cube of

For considerable periods of time the coefficients of these terms remain sensibly constant and their angles or arguments increase uniformly with the time. Having found from the development of the potential what are the more important terms, one then assumes that by leaving all amplitudes and epochs arbitrary the series is, by the principle of forced oscillations,· capable of representing the tide at any given station. The harmonic analysis, § 49, has for its object the determination of these amplitudes and epochs from tidal records. 49.

For aiding the imagination, we may suppose that any given term in this series represents the oscillation caused by a fictitious star, or moon, moving uniformly in the celestial equator arouncl the earth, and at a constant distance therefrom, having the property of producing a maximum of the oscillation, or component tide, a certain number of hours after its meridian passage. If a denote the 'hourly speed of the component A, or the apparent itngular velocity of its fictitious moon, and A 0 its epoch or lag expressed in degrees, A 0 ja is the lag expressed in hours.

NONH.A.RMONIC REDUOTIONS, ETC.

50. The object of these reductions is t.o determine nonharmonic quantities from observations made upon high and low waters. Of these quantities the most im'portaut are the lunitidal intervals ( HWI a'ld JJWI) and the mean range of tide (Mn). The times and heights of the individual tides depart more or less from the values which would be obtained from applying the mean lunitidal intervals to the times of transits and using the mean range. The departures have a certain kind of periodicity depending upon the inequalities to which they are due, and they may be tabulated with reference to each inequality known to exist in the tide at all places; that is, so tabulated as to follow some known astronomical argument. A set of tables thus formed may be regarded as a s~ries of corrections t.o be applied to the mean tides because of the several inequalities. In case of the largest of the inequalities, it is more convenient for some purposes to have tabulated the actual values of the intervals and heights throughout the period of the inequality instead of the departures from their mean values. In case of the phase inequality the "time of tide" may be tabulated directly instead of the lunitidal intervals. t After such tables have been obtained from the observations, one may, if he choose, analyze the tabular values, thus obtaining a set of coefficients (intervals or epochs and amplitudes) from which these tables could be reproduced.
·The arguments for January 1 of each year from 1850 to 1950 are given in Table 3. t Cf. Lubbock, Phil. Trans., 1831, pp. 398, 399. Here the time of the year (i. e., the month) is used for one of the arguments and so no correction is necessary because of the eq nation of time. For examples of curves of phase inequality, see Phil. Trans., 1868, last plate.

The di sad va11tage of the nonharmonic treatment lies in t.he fact that when several considerable corrections are successively applied to the mean tides, the resulting effect is not the same as it would have been had all been appli<'d simultaneously, as in the case of nature. It therefore becomes important to tabulate each inequality not only with respect to its own argument, but also with respect to the argument of t,he principal or phase inequality. This necessitates a table of double entry. In some cases it might be advisable to have tables of triple entry. For the present we shall assume that the length of the series of observations treated is sufficient for separating the various inequalities sought. Then it is obvious that, grouping the observations with respect to the argument (uniformly varying with the time, or nearly so) of any particular inequality, we shall obtain in the long run certain departures from the mean values of the lunitidal intervals and range, which may be tabulated without making any assumption as regards the age of the inequality sought, and so using, say, the immediately preceding transit.. Snch results are of interest for theoretical lmrposes. For actual prediction, however, where all important inequalities should be properly applied, it is desirable to form tables of double entry. 51. First reduction. The principal object of this reduction is to determine the 1u11itidal iutPrvals and the mean range of tide. A specimen of first reduction is given in § 60. 'I.'his shows that, for Tybee Island Light, Georgia, H\VI = 711 11m, L\VI = l1' oom, Mn= 6·8 feet. To roughly predict the tides for Tybee Island Light (in local time), copy down the local times of the moon's transits across the meridian of Tybee Island Ught, and add the intervals, 711 1110 for the high waters and l1' oom for the low waters. To obtain predictions in eighty-first meridian time, .using Greenwich transits, add the uncorrected intervals, 'jh 21 for high waters and lh JOm for low waters. Having thus determined the times, the heights with reference to half-tide Jeyel may be roughly determined by calling the high-water heights ~ of 6·8, or + 3·4, and the low-water hcigllts, - 3·4; or, referred to the particular staff used, they are on an average !)·4 and 2·G foet, respectively, as found in tbe reduction. Another specimen of first reduction, with some additional matter not important for the present purpose, is given in § 30, Part III. 52. Determination of the periods of tidal ineq11a.Uties. '.rhe existence of several tidal inequalities can be inferred from very simple considerations; of these may be mentioned the phase, parallax, and declinational inequalities. Others would hardly be suspected without developing the pote11tial of the tide-producing forces. For the present we may assume snch a development made in terms strictly periodic, and also assume that terms of like period are to be found in the tide. Such terms, or component tides, as go tllrough their respective periods twice a day, pretty nearly, having the subscript 2 added to the letters used to designate them, are, as already stated, called semidiurnals; and those once a day, having the subscript 1, are called diurnals.· The number of degrees per hour, i. e. the speed, may be denoted in each instance by the corresponding small letter. Looking now at the column headed "Synodic period," Table 1, it will be seen that there are, opposite the semidiuruals, the synodic periods 14·7652!), 27·55456, 13·660W, 31·8119 ~, 15·38734, days. These are a half synodic month, an anomalistfo month, a half tropical month, the moon's evectional period, etc. To this list we should add such synodic periods as would be obtained by means of the lunar nodal components differing in period very little from M2 and K 2 , respectively.t The synodic period for the first is the nodeequinox period, or about 18·6 years, and the corresponding variation in the tide is called the lunar noda,l inequality. In regions where the water is shallow and subject to annual changes, the year should be used as one of the periods. In this way may be obtained the periods of all sensible inequalities affecting the semidaily tide, i. e., those affecting both bigh waters of the day alike, also both low waters. Tbe diurnal inequality in the tide is really made up of several partial diurnal inequalities.

They affect in nearly opposite ways the two high waters of a day aud also the two low waters. The periods in which they should be tabulated are those Rynodic periods given in Table 1 which stand opposite the diurnal components. To this list of diurnal components should be added the 1uuar nodals having speeds nearly equal to the speeds of K 1 and 0 1, respectively.· The Rynodic periods just referred to are such that the same transit (upper or lower) should be adhered to throughout. It has been supposed that the inequalities have periods of fixed lengtlu,;; but the arguments which divide up t.he periods may uot vary exactly uniformly with the time throughout these periods. Such are styled circular arguments. Most inequalities in the moon's motion have little effect upon the lunitidal intervals, especially if the ages of the correRponding tidal inequalities be properly allowed for in the selection of transits. 'l'he reason for this is quite obvious. With the amplitude of the tide it is otherwise. By considering the effects upon amplitude only, and disregarding the effects upon interval, it is sometimes possible, when non-circular arguments are used, to throw two or more inequalities into oue. l·'or instance, if the moon's parallax be the argument (Preferably noting whether it is increasing or decreasing, thereby avoiding the consideration of age), the parallax and evectional inequalities referred to above will be embraced in the tabulated height or amplitude corrections. The time corrections will be somewhat uncertain. A similar remark applies to tl1e tleclinational and nodal inequalities. If we take a month's observations about the equinoxes, the diurnal inequality will be due to the moon, and so the lunar part of K 1 is involved infc!tead of the entire K 1· If groups of observations are taken about the times of zero declination of the moon, the diurnal inequality will be due to the bun, and so, instead of K 1, 0 1, 00, tile involved components are the solar part of K 1 and P 1· In grouping observations with respect to these arguments or periods, the transits should, as a rule, be kept distinct; for, it is an easy matter to subsequently combine values lielo11ging to the upper and lower transits if desired. For instance, when tabulating for tlie inequality whose period is a tropical month, we should have, opposite the moon's right ascension or longitude, two classes of high-water lunitidal intervals (approximately equal) derived from upper and lower transits, respectively, or two such classes of intervals (differing by approximately 12 hours) derived from one transit; so for tile luw-water lnnitidal iutervals. Each of these four kinds of intervals should be accompanied by a corresponding heigilt. In this case the diurnal and semidiurnal inequality, whose period is a tropical month or a half tropical month, are capable of being tabulated together. The half-tide level is subject to small inequalities having the periods of the preceding tidal inequalities, or some simple fractious or multiples of such periods. These fluctuations in half-tide level may be due to long-period components (which are astronomical, meteorological, or slrnllowwater) or to fixed speed relations in the components of short period.+ The greatest of these inequalities is, at most places, the annual; it involves tile components Sa, Ssa. If high water only be observed, these inequalities in half-tide level cannot be separated from the inequalities in mean high-water heights.

If we suppose that the inequality has been analyzed and certain epochs and amplitudes obtained, it is to be noted that tile epochs (with single subscript) of the inequalities should be proportional to the respective ages of tile latt~r. 'rhis implies that if an astronomical argument be taken out, on an average, a constant amount earlier or later than the particular phase of the tide (generally midway between high and low water) to which the analysis refers, the epochs must be altered by the respective variations in the arguments duriug this constant interval; i.e., the position of the tidal inequality is required at the time at which the astronomical argument is taken; or, what amounts to the same thing, the value of the astronomical argument is required at the phase of the tide with respect to which the analysis is carried out. Suppose high-water heights to be analyzed; they belong, on an average, to a time a constant number of hours, HWI (uncorrected), after the moon's transit. Suppose the ranges analyzed; they belong to a time ~ (HWI + LWI) after the moon's transit. For the convenience of many places, all astronomical arguments can be taken out at the times of the moon's transit across, say, the meridian of Greenwich, and the epochs afterwards altered accordingly. 'rhe epochs require no alteration.if the astronomical arguments be taken out at the particular phase of the tide to which the analysis refers. This latter method, however, seems particularly undesirable, if not practically impossible, in the case of the diurnal inequalities.·

57. On the use of noncircttlar arguments. Tidal inequalities depend upon the difference in right ascension of sun and moon (which is usually given by the hour of trausit), their parallaxes, and their declinations. U nlesR the ages of the inequalities be properly allowed for by selecting suitable transits, it is necessary to make a distinction between increasing and decreasing parallax or declination. These arguments are naturally suggested by the equilibrium theory of tides. A set of tables each having the hour of transit as one argument and parallax or declination of. the sun or moon for the other, is given in the Tide TableR for the British and Irish Ports, issued by the commissioners of the admiralty; the daily predictious therein published are obtaiued by

Inference of tidal inequalities from observed nonltarmonic constants, etc. Owing to the great amount of labor involved in completely deducing tidal inequalities from observations, it does not seem advantageous to work along tllat line for obtaining practical results, although it may be desirable for certain theoretical purposes. In fact the results of discussions covering a long period of time (say a node-equinox period) are always instructive. If, on the other liand, we confine our attention to determining a few quantities which fix the size and position of each important inequality, a general knowledge of tides ought to enable us to form tables, based upon these determinations, which are sensibly true at most places. For instance, if the spring, mean, and 11eap ranges, also tlle age of the phase inequality are known, the phase inequality in interval aud range become approximate]~' known at any given time by means of the following general table.

In the column headed "Increase in lunitidal intervals" the negative values are often spoken of as the priming and the positive ones as the lu!f!Jing of tlie tide. The vulgar establishment, being the interval at "full and change," may be obtained from the mean lunitidal interval by entering the first table as many hours before spring tides as are contained in the age of the phase inequality. In making use of these tables for prediction purposes, the mean range (Mn) should be first multiplied by the factor q expressing the parallax effect; this corrected range should then be used in ascertaining the variation due to phase in the lunitidal interval and in obtaining the sernirange of tide. If several "tables of' phase effects" like the above be constructed with as many assumed values of S 2 /M 2 , or of (Sg - Np)/2:Mn, the [).Ccuracy of the results will be somewhat increased. This table is based upon Table 24, wherein Si )1 2 was taken as 0·46531. _ Of course this table of parallax effect can be replaced by a more accurate one involving the perigean and apogean ranges (Pn, An); but to realize this increased accuracy these ranges would have to be known from observation, and the age of the parallax inequality should also be observed and not assumed to be that of the phase inequality. A general table giving the diurnal inequality at any time, and involving certain nonharmonic constants, would hardly be feasibie, because of the nurnerous arguments involved.· Nevertheless, constants like the tropic high-and low-water inequalities in h~igbt (HWQ, LWC~), the corresponding intervals, the great and small tropic ranges (Ge, Sc) are serviceable in describing the character of the tide. In Chapter III, Part III, a scheme is given for the determination of the following no11harmo11ic quantities: HWI Mn LWI Ge Tropic HHWI Sc Tropic LIIWI Gt SI Tropic LLWI Tropic HL WI Sg Age of phase inequality Xp Age of parallax inequality Pn .Age of diurnal inequaiity An HWQ LWQ L w (OU staff) Tropic LL W (on staff) Mean LLW (on staff) In the determination of' these, the portion of the work relating exclusively to harmonic constants may, of course, he omitted. In the reductions for finding the spriug range, awl e8pPciaJly that for finding the neap (Part III,§§ 29, 30), it is importa11t to know the exact age of the inequality and to then use a grnup no

more extensive than is necessary, say four tides in case of a long series and eight, for a short series. For this reason the age should be found by the inequality method,§ 55 (especially where there are shallow water components), instead of by noting when the interval has its mean value. In order to obtain good results and to avoid the labor of making certain corrections, series six or twelve months in length should be used. If the harmonic constsnts have been determined from hourly ordinates or from high and low waters in accordance with Part II, the ages derived from them may be used to advantage in taking out the above quantities. In all cases the longer the S«.'ries the narrower may be the group, and so the more definite th~ quantities found. The non harmonic constants given in the Tide Tables by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey are HWI, J,WI, tropic IlHWI, tropic J,L\VI, Mn, Sg, Np, Ge, HWQ, LWQ, D 1IIWI,

(147)

2D 1 denotes the tropic range of the diurnal wave and D 1 IIWI its lunitidal interval. The quantities ranking next in importance to those given are probably the ages of the phase and diurnal inequalities. . These can be compared and other nonharmonic co11stants snpplie1l by aitl of the followi11g exact or approximate theoretical relations between the various ra11ges, intervals, etc., obtained, directly or indirectly, from Part Ill: ' (Sg- Np) 2 2 Mn= Sg +.Np+ !-sg+Nl>-.

59. Prediction direct from observation. Suppose that a person start with a blank book containing as many pages as there are days in a year and labeled accordingly. Suppose the page ruled into 12 (or 24) columns, one for each possible degree of the moon's declination, viz .· 18° to 290. Let the page be divided horizontally into .15 equal strips, one for each day of the moon's age, reckoned from full moon as well as from new. In each of the rectangles thus formed Jet the observed heights and lunitidal intervals (obtained from the observed times and properly marked) be recorded. If observations be made throughout the node-equinox period, or about nineteen years, and thus tabulated, preuictions can be made by referring to this record in the following manner: Turn to the day of the year for which predictions are required. Select such tabular values as correspond most nearly to the age and declination of the moon for tlrn given day. If no such tabular value can be found upon the page for· the day in question, go a few days forward or backward until a tabular value is found which has very nearly the required arguments. The lunitidal intervals there tabulated give, when applied to the moon's transits for the day in question, the times of the tides. The heights are the tabular values unaltered. If in making the tabulation the effect of parallax upon the height of the tide is aJiowed for, it may be roughly ip.troduced, when predictions are required, by multiplying the range of the tide by the cube of the value of the parallax for the day divided by the cube of its mean value, o.r by makiug use of the second table of § 58. The moon's transits, declination, age, and parallax, when used, are supposed to be taken from the Nautical Almanac. · A very convenient method for obtaining fairly good predictions at a station having either great or small diurnal inequality, is the following: Take a year's observed high and low waters, or pref'<>rably a year's accurate predictions, and copy down alongside each date the time of the moon's Ruperior transit. '.l.'o predict for any given day of any year, use that part of' the year tabulated which is about the same season of the year as is the given date. :Find a day having, as nearly as may ue, the sarue hour of transit as has the given day. The times and heights of the tides for that day will be approximately the values required, If only very rough predictions are required, all inequalities may be omitted. In this case it . is sufficient to know the high-water lunitidal interval and the mean range of tide. This lJas been explained in § 51. In regions where the diurnal inequality is small the page should be divided with referenee to the various values of the moon's parallax instead of' declination. GO. Phase reduction.~. Along the coast of Europe and the Atlantic coast of America, the region of the West Indies excepted, the tide is of the semidiurnal type. Consequently, the greatest i11equality is the phase or semimenstrual, due to the sun. This is more especially tme of times than of' beighti;i. If a person has secured a month of observations upon hig·h and low water for any place along these coasts, he can, with very little computation, obtain reasonably good predictions. He bas only to tabulate the tides, along with the times of the moo11~s transits, take the lunitidal intervals (using the trausit immediately preceding) aud distribute the iutervals and heights according to the hour of transit, going from O to 12. 'fhis distribution constitutes a "second" or "phase reduction," an example of which is given below. Or, be may tabulate the times and heights without using iutervals, according to the hour of' the moon's trausit. In the latter case the time of the tide can be ascertained without even adding t.he interval to the time of transit, because the times of the tide are supposed to be tabulated with reference to the hour of transit as an argument. If the observations are Jess than a year in exteut, their times, as well as the times of the transits, should, strictly speaking, be changed into apparent time before making a phase reduct10n; or the average value of the equation of time \'rable 30) for the period of observat1011s may

be substracte<l from the "hour of transit argument" of the reduction results, thus obtaining the same prediction table as before. The predictions made therefrom are, of course, in apparent time and must be changed into mean time by Table 30. On the Atlantic coast of the United States, the phase inequality being small, the kind of time used is quite immaterial, mean time being almost as satisfactory as apparent. 'l'bc prediction table got out in the kind of mean time used in the observations can be adapted to another kind of mean time by applying a constant (equal to the difference between the two kinds of time) to the tabular values. An example of the method of making a "first" and a "phase" (or" second") reduction, is given for Tybee Island Light, Savannah Hiver Entrance, Geoi·gia, for l\lay 1-29, 1891. As a matter of convenience, the GrP.enwich time of the moon's transit is taken directly from the Nautical Almanac, merely changing astronomical to civil time. The observations were made in eighty-first meridian time, which is 511 24m west, while the local meridian is 51i 23 111 ·37 west. In tabulating tile observations two lines are given to each day. All hours less than 12 are in the morning; all greater are in the aft~rnoon, and when diminished by 12 give the usual teckoning; for instance, 1511 is 3 p. m.

UNITED STA1'ES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The first reduction is made by subtracting each transit from the time of high or low water which directly follows it, thus filling out the columns headed '' Lunitidal interval." If the observations had been taken in local time, and the local time of the moon's transit across the local meridian had been used, these lunitidal intervals would represent the lag of the tide behind the moon; but in this example each interval is to a certain extent fi"titious, and requires a correction in order to reduce it to its true local value. As a general rule, however, there is uo need of correcting each interval, for only average intervals are of use, so that the mean of all the high-water and of the low-water intervals can be corrected by applying a constant once for all, which is obtained as follows: Let S = west longitude in time of the time meridian used. L = " " " " station. E= " " " " ephemeris used for transits. Then the correction to reduce the observation time to local time is
S- L,
(166)

and the correction to the intervals, due to the motion of the moon in her orbit while passing from the meridian of the ephemeris to the meridian of the station, is ·
0·035 (liJ - L). (167)

Combining both corrections, we have for the entire interval correction expressed in hours
S- L
11

+ 0·035 (E 11

L).
111

(168)

In this example S = 5h·400, L = 5 ·390, aud E = 0 ·000; hence, the correction is -10 ·7, as stated on the first reduction sheet. The phase on second reduction is made by distributing the intervals aud heights of the first reduction according to the hour of the moon's transit. All intervals for high water which were obtained by using transits occurring between 0 11 oom and 0 11 59 111 , as also betweeu 12h OOm and 121i 5!J 111 , together with the corresponding heights, are thrown into one group; those intervals resulting from transits between 1 h oom and 1 h 59m, and between 1311 oom and 1311 5!Jm, are also colleC'ted together into one group; and similarly for each hour of the moon's transit. The same distribution is then made for the low-water intervals and heights. Bach group is summed and the mean obtained by dividing by the number of observations. The twelve means, oue for each hour of transit from 0 to 11, are then brought together into a tabular form, designated, as a ''Recapitulation," and the mean of all obtained by dividing the sum by twelve. Before using these final mean iutervals as the establishment for high or low water, they must be corrected in the same manner as the first reduction results were, which in this case is done by subtracting 10·7 minutes from each. 61. Rou(Jh prediction of tides from phase reduction. The values contained in the recapitulation of the phase reduction may be represented graphically by plotting them upon profile paper and joining the points thus given with a curved or broken line. (See Fig. 8.) These curves can be used for making approximate predictions of the tide at the station, but their irregularities i,;l10uld first be smoothed out by estimation of the eyP, or preferably by means of t.he Fourier series, using only those terms of the series whose coeflicients have the subscripts 1 and 2, and the even-numbered hours, in the form given in § 71, Part II. In order to make this method of prediction clear, an example is given of the predicted times aud heights of high and low waters at Tybee Island Light, Georgia, on the first five days of January, 1898, using the uncorrected curves of Fig. 8, although the results must be rougher than those which might have been obtained by aid of§ 55. In this example the Greenwich times of the moou's trausits are taken from the Ephemeris or Nautical Almauac, merely changing the time into civil reckoning. The curves are then read at the times of transit, furnishing the values given ill the lines marked H \VI (high-water iuterval) and L WI (low-water interval). These readings of the interval curves added to the time of transit give the approximate times of high and low water. The height curves are also read at the times of tran.sit. No distinction is made between upper and lower transits in this method of prediction; and whenever the hours of transit exceed twelve t11ey are reckoned as applying to the curves at a time twelve hours earlier, but the real value of the time of trausit is set down in the computation.

It will be observed that the computed time of ti1le frequently comes out greater tl.iau twenty-four ho.urs; this is to be understood as indicating the uumher of hours which have elapsetl from miduight, llegiuning the day on which the transit used occurs, until the given tide. By sulltracting twenty-fourhours antl increasing the day by oue such times may be expressed in the usual reckoning; for instance, the high water given as 25h 43m on December 31, 18!J7, corresponds to l11 43m on Jauuary 1, 18!:18. 'l'he predicted times are expressed in eighty-first meridian time, the same as the observations were taken in. The predicted heights are as they would read on tlie tide staff upon which the observations were made. From the phase reduction it appears that mean low water read 2·6 feet on the staff; hence to retluce these predicted heights to the plane of mean low water subtract 2·6 feet from each. In case one desires to make predictions in any kind of time other ihan that in which the observations Wl're taken and to refer the heights to any g·iven plane of reforence, the table of recapitulated values of the phase reduction should be so modified as to satisfy these conditions; and then the values should be plotted, and the curves used as before. The phase inequality in height may be reduced to its mean value by divitling by the "factor for (Sg - Np)"§ 58, antl the remark there made conceruing the effect of parallax upon the range applies here also. 62. Types of tide. Observations show that cotidal lines off a shore or reef are nearly parallel to the same, resembliug somewhat the contours of equal depths. This is what would naturally follow from the consideration of a free wave propagated over shallow areas. The same remark applies with about the same degree of precision to lines of equal lunit.idal interval. Example.-Luuitiual intervals for the (outer) coast of the United States:

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

These intervals must he increased for bays or tidal rivers. On the Atlantic coast the <liurual wase is small in comparison with the semidiurnal. On the Pacific coast the two may approach equality. '.ro ascertain the type of tide from the above values, draw a diurnal and a semidiurnal wave; then combine the two by adding the ordinates algel>raically. (S1:;e Figs. 1, 7.) The (tropic) diurnal high waters being three hours in advance of the semidinrnal high waters in the northern New England region, it follows t11at there is about the same inequality in the high as in the low waters, that the sequence of tide is from highe1· high to lower low, that the tropic higher high-water interval is less than HWI and should be marked a, that the tropic lower lowwater interval should be greater than L \VI and marked b if taken about six hours less than HWI:

a indicates that the interval is to be applied to an ]upper transit, the moon's decli11ation being a ower north; b m · d" · t en·a I 1s · t o 1ue ' 1 t o an a lower ' d ec l" south; ICU te s tirn t ti · ie Ill app i·Ieu upper t rans1"t, th e moons ma t· 10n
11orth.· g south. For the remainder of the Atlantic coast, the l1igh waters of both waves nearly coincide, thereby putting nearly 1tll of the height inequaJity in the high waters. In fact, the low-water inequality is so small that the sequence of the tropic tides <loes not remain fixed throughout the year. (See §21, Part III.) The tropic high-water interval is almost exactly equal to HWI an<l should be marked a. On the Pacific coast the greater height inequality is, obviously, in the low waters, but there is a good amount in the high waters. 'l'lie seque11ce is 11ig11er l1igh to lower low. 'l'he tropic higher high-water interval is less than HWI, antl shonhl he marked a unless tlic small value (about zero) be used, in which case it !'.honld be marked b. The tro11ic lower low. water interval is greater than LWI, a11<l shoulll be marked b if taken about six hours less than the I-IWI marked a. Particular localitics.-The tides at 'Willets Poiut, N. Y. (see Figs. 9-HI), have a comparatively long stand, somewhat resembling the tides at Havre. The alternate low waters (more definitely the" lower lows") approad1 at times to the condition of double tides or aggers, § 15. The tide at Sandy Hook, N. ,J., is "regular;" t11at is, comparatively free from shallow water components. Thi.s curve is characteristic of tlie tides at ocean stati.ons along tbe Atla11tic coast of the United States. All along this coast the phase nn<l diurnal inequalities in height are srnaU in comparison with tlle range of tide. 'l'he ~hanges in mean sea level which happen <luring the fortnight shown arc not tidal, but meteorological. A.t Philadelphia, Pa.,t the stand is short. The duration of fall is mnch longer tlian the duration of rise. In fact, there is a tendency toward a bore. This tendency is earried much further at ltambler Island and Volcano Isla.Jl(l, as is shown by Fig. rn. At Galveston, Tex., the tide is almost wholly diurnal. When the moon is north of the equator the tides follow one transit, au<l when south, the other. When she is upon the equator the tides nearly disappear. At Mazatlan, 1\Iexico, the tide has large phase and diurnal inequalities in height. The former causes the sernidaily range of tide to disappear at times (n<'ar neap tides), and the lunitidal intervals to suddenly change in value. This feature is found in tbe ti.des at Port Adelaide, Australia, where it is locally termed the "dodging tide." At Port '.row11se11d, Wash., the diurnal wave is large whenever the declination of the moon is considerable. Its phase with respect to the sernidiurual is then su.ch that nearly all of the diurnal height inequality occurs in the low waters, and so nearly all of the diurnal time inequality occnrs in the high waters. Here the sequence of till es is unce1 tain even at the times of extreme declination. At St. Michael, Alaska, the tide is essentially diurnal.

REPORT FOR 1897-PART II.

API'E"NDIX NO. 8.

385

At Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, the clinmal height inequality is nearly all in the high waters, instead of the low. At Tahiti tbc tide is largely solar, so that the solitidal intervals arc gP-nerally more nearly constant than the lunitidal intervals. (For a plotting- of the solitidal intervals, see Fig. 13 of Ferrel's Tidal Hesearchcs.) At Havre, France, the tides have a long stand and approach the double-headed form. The phase inequality is large ill comparison with this inequality on our Atlantic coast. Fig.1!) is obtained from observations published in a Ueport on tlie llore of the Tsien-tang Kiang, by Commander Moore, R. N. Raining is at a point where the estuary suddenly narrows; Rambler Island and \'olmtno Islands arc situated seaward about ~8 and 75 statute miles, respectively. 6584--25

CHAPTElt V.
TIDAL WORK AND KNOWLEDGE BEFORE THE TIME OF NEWTON.

63. The maritime people of antiquity whose history has come down to us lived on or near the .Mediterranean Sea, where the tide is generally small, aud so they probably paid little attention to this periodic rising and falling of the waters. The numerous islands and straits, however, give rise to tidal races, and these in turn may be accompanied by whirlpools. The mythological Scylla ancl Charybdis, described by Homer,· were at a later periou localized in the Straits of Messina, Scylla being a rock ou the Italian shore, ancl Uharybdis a whirlpool (now Galofaro) near the Sicilian shore.+ He places them near Trinacria (or Thrinacia)'l the three-cornered island of the sun, afterwards localized as Sicily. t The velocity of this race may be 6 miles per hour, while the range of the tide is but 1 foot. Homer says, "Under this§ divine Charybdis sucks in black water. For thrice in a day she seuds it out, and thrice she sucks it in terribly." Strnbo, probably without sufficient ~ounds, is inclined to attribute to Homer some knowledge of ordinary tides, and says, "The assertion of thrice, instead of twice, is either an error of the author or a blunder of the scribe." II Strabo subsequently makes another explanation, viz., that Circe says tlirice instead of twice iu 01·der to exaggerate the perils which await Ulysses, and so to deter him from departing. Strabo adds, "However, this latter is a hyperbole wliich everyone makes use of; thus we say thl'icehappy and tlirice-miserable.''11 Gossellin remarks," In the Euripus, which divides the Isle of Negro· pont from Bmotia, the waters are obserYecl to flow in opposite directions several times a day. 1t was from this t:hat Horner probably drew his ideas.'' 0 Accm·diug to the explanation adopted, ''thrice" may lJe either an inteusitive or an indefinite term. The much more formidable tidal currents in the fjords of Norway and among the islands aronrnl Scotland have undoubtedly played an important part iu the mythology of the a11cie11t in habitants of these couutries. tt While the m,ytlls of Scylla and Charybdis undoubtedly owe their origin to tidal movements, antl while the large tides of the Hed Sea may possibly help to explain the passage of the Israelites, ft it ;;eem,:; probable that the deluge was <lne to some earthquake disturbance whereby a portion of lower Mesopotamia may have beeu submerged.§§

64. Herodotus (484-428 B. C.) says, referring to a certain bay or arm of the Hed Sea, "And in it an ebb and tlow takes place daily."· 'l'his is the only mention be makes of tides proper, and he says notbing conceming their origin. He thus describes the annual overflow of the Nile:
Hespecting the natnre of thit1 river, I was unable to gain any informntion, either from the priests or anyone else. I was very desironli, however, of learuing from them why the Nile, beginning nt tlrn summer t1olstice, fills and ovnrfiows for n hundred days; and when it haH near!~· completed this nnmbt·r of dayH, falls short in its stream, and retires; so that it continues low all tho winter, until the return of the summer t1olsticc. t

Herodotus then gives several opinions which had been advanced by others to explain this characteristic of the Nile, and follows these by an explanation of his own, which amounts to attrilmting the low stages during the winter season to evaporation caused by the :,mu then being over upper Libya. Although l'lato (420-348 B. C. ), in common with most of the Greek philosophers, believed the earth an animal, he does not attribute the rising and falling of waters to its breathing, but rather to oscillations of the fluid within the earth. Fournier, in his Hydrograpltie (1643), does not regard this latter hypotllesis as altogether untenable. Aristotle (384--322 B. C.) seems t11 liave been aware of the existence of tides in certain places; but he probably paid little attention to tbem, notwithstanding the allegernent that his death was indirectly due to the study of their cause.:j: The following extract is taken from the fourth chapter of his letter entitled "On the universe," addressed to Alexander, aud which, although usually regarded as spurious, may ueycrtheless embody the ideas of Aristotle. Other than this, his writings refer to the tides bnt twice. He states that great tides are found in northern I~urope, aud that they are gn,ater in a large sea than in a small one.§ 'l'lle periodicity of the tide and its connection with the moon's motion are alluded to, but only as if by hearsay. t5ubmersions of the coast aud waves due to earthquakes would, 11aturally enough, have been better k11ow11 to him.
Things a1111logons to these II are found in the Hon ahio; for, oftentimes chasms in the water uro formed 1.Jy the receding wavet1, and the incoming wn.YeB advance, Aometimes agniu retrnuting nml sometimes only rushing straight forwar<l as seems to have huppeuod to Helice anti Bum.~ Oftentimes also lier~· eruptions exist iu the sen, fountains gush out, 111011tht1 of rivers nre opened, trocH spring np, delug-cA and whii·Ipools ariH<» corresponding to thosll which often accompany the wind; some in the mitldln of the tleep seu., others in straits and hays. It i» even said that many elibings and risings of the sea alwap1 come around with the moon mu\ upon certain lixell times.

In speaking of northern Portugal, Strabo says:

journey (325 B. C. ), they were amazed a.t the tides, having never noticed any similar phenomenon in the Mediterranean Sea. Curtius (fl. c. 50 .A.. D.) narrates their experience on this occasion in his History of the Lite and Reign of Alexander.·
On the third day the insinuations of the sea were perceptible in the river, blending their unequal waves by a gentle influx. I To :l second island, seated in the mi<ldle of the river, the navigators were then bornn somewhat more slowl,v, because the stream was counteracted by the tide. They moor their vessels, and separate in parties to forage, without a presentiment of the disaster which overtakes.mariners locally uninstructed. About tbe third hour,t the ocean, according to a regular alternation, began to flow in furiously, driving liack the ri\·er. The river-at first, arrested; then, impressed with 11 new force-rushed upward with more impetuosity than torrents descend a precipitous channel. The mass on board, nnacqnainted with the nature of the tide, saw 011ly prodigies and symbols of the wrath of the gods. Ever and anon, the sea swelle<l; and, on plains recently dry, descc111led a diffused floo<l. The vessels lifte<l from their stations, a111l the wholtl fleet. dispersed,-those who had debarke1l, in terror aud astonishment at the calamity, ran from nil 1Juart11rs toward the ships. But tumultuous hurry is slow. These, with boat hooks, are hauling up their gallies: these, while fixiug their seats, prevent the oars from being paired: some, hastening to sail, without waiting for the complement of mariners, impel languid hulls, unmanageable, crippled in the wings of navigation: other transports could not hol<l those who inconsiderately pressed into them: <lefi<·ient, or redundant, numbers equally obstructed the impatient. Here was clamored," \V:iit:"-here, "Row off." Dissonant voices, circulating inconsistent orders, prevented the mnltitmle from acting by their own observation, or from hearing the general command. Nor availed the pilots; whose directions were either undistinguished in the tumult, or disobeyed by terrified and promiscuous crews. Vessels dash together; and oars are by turns snatche\l away, to impel other gallies. A spectator would not imagine a fleet carrying the same army, but hostile navies commencing a battle. Prows strike against sterns: on the invading vessels, others drive aft. The for,1· of altercation carried the mariners to blows. Now the tide ba<l iuundatecl all the fields skirting the river, only tops of knolls extant like little islands: to these, from the evacuated ships, the majority swam in consternation. The dispersed fleet was, partly, riding in dt·ep water, where the land was depressed into delJR; an<l, partly, resting 011 shoals, where the flood had covered elevated ground .. Suddenly breaks on the Macedonians a new alarm, more vivid than the former. The sea began to ebb; the deluge with a violent drain, to retreat into the frith, disclosing tractR just before deeply liuried. Un buoyed, the ships pitched, some upon their prows, some upon their sides. The fields were strewed with baggage, arms, loose planks, and fragmentR of oars. Tbe solcliers, neither daring to descernl to the ground, nor reconciling themselves to stay in the trans11orts, awaited what calamities conl<l follow heavier than the present. They scarcely believed what they suffered, and witnes11ed-shipwrecks on dry land, the sea i11 a river. ~or yet ended their unhappiness; for, ignorant that the speedy return of tlw ticle would set their ships nllont, they predicted to themselves famine and death. Terrifying monsters, too, left by the waves, were vagrant.Iy gliding
around.~

Now night approached; and the desperate circumstances touched the king with concern: but no anxieties coulcl overwhelm his invincible courage. All night; he superintended the watches: he 11ent forward horsemen to the month of the riYer, to bring intelligence when the aeces8 of the tide ··ommeneed. Meanwhile, he ordered the shattered ships to be refitted, the overset to be propped up; and the mariner!! to be prepared, and attentive, against the flnx of t11e tide. The night consumed in vigil:mee :incl exhortations, the hon1emen are descried, flying buck in fnll career, followed by the tide. By a gradual diffusion, the inundation began to raise the ships; preeently, flooding all tho fields, it set the fleet in motion. Along the b:mks, resounded from tho soldiers and mariners shouts of boundless joy, celebrating an unhoped deliverance. "\Vhence reissued suddenly so great :t seat \Vhither the day before had it retreated T What were the nature of the element, elsewhere refusing and here acknowledging pcrio<lical lawsf" with wonder they inquired. From what had happened, tho king conjectured tlrn appointed time of the llnx to be just after snnrise. To anticipate the tide, he, at midnight, desc<mded the river with a fow vessels; and, passing its mouth, advanced four hundrn<I stadia into the sou. A favorite object accomplished, he sacrificed to Neptune and the local deities, 1111<1 returned to the fleet.

66. Seleucus, a mathematician of Babylonia (36ii-283 B. C.), admitted the rotary movement of the earth, but thought the moon moved in the opposite direction. By this means, lie thought, w:wes happening between the earth's center and the moon become accumulated and i.;o form the tide; or tha.t the tide results from winds s"'t up by these oppo,;ing mot.ions.II According to Posido· nius,,T Seleucus connected the irregular tirle8 of the Persian Gulf with the moon and its various declinations. He observed tides from Phmnicia to the Atlantic coast of Spain. Pytheas, of Massilia (fl. c. 325 B.

the tides and moon; and was, so far as known, the ffrst person to point out the connection between the half-monthly variation in tlie tide and the phases of the moon. He is said to be the first to measure the heights of the tide. Plutarch (q. v.) in referring to Pytheas, seems to have the erro· neons notion that high water occurs at full moon and low water at new moon. One of Aristotle's remarks, however, would seem to indicate that somebody had brought him (Aristotle) accounts of tides which had been referred to the moon. Pytheas wrote a work on matters pertaining to the ocean which has not come down to us. Bratosthencs (276- ll. C.), according to Strabo (q. v.), believed th~ tidal currents of the Mediterranean due to a difference in level at 11eighbo1·iug points. Posidonius, the Stoic philosopher (c. 130-50 B. C.), continued the history of Polybius. Only fragments of his work exist. According to Strabo (q. Y.) he was the author ofa Treatise 011 the Ocean, and an authority on tidal knowledge. He is said to have tried to calculate the influence of the moon upon the tides. 67. Strabo (c. 54 B. C.-c. 24 A. D.). Strabo believes that the uniformity and the considerable size of the ocean tides go to prove that all land is surrounded by the ocean. He says:
Those who have returned from an uttempt to <'ircnmnavigate the earth, do not say they h11Ye been 11revented from continuing their voyage by any opposing continent, for the sea remained perfectly open, but through want of resolution, and the scarcity of provision. This theory too accords better with the ebb and flow of the ocean, for the phenomenon, both in the increase a11<l diminution, is every where identical, or at all events has but little differoncc, as if produced by the agitation of one sea, and resulting from one cause. 'Ve must not credit Hipparchus, who combats this opinion, denying that the ocean is every where similarly affected; or that even if it were, it would not follow that the Atlantic flowed in 1' circle, and thus continually· returned into itself. Seleucus, the Babylonian, is his authority for this assertion. For a further investigation of the occnn nnd its tides we refer to l'osidonius and Athenodorus, who have fully discussed this snliject: we will now only remark that this view agrees better with the uniformity of the phenomenon; and that the greater the 11mo11nt of moiHture surrounding the earth, tho easier would the he1wcnly bodies be supplied with vapours from thence.·

Strabo's ideas concerning the figure and position of the earth, the force of gravity, and the nature of sea level may be seen from the following quotations:
We shall ulso assume that the earth is sphoroidul, that itll surface is likewise spheroidal, and above all, that bodies have a tendency towards its centre, which latter point is clear to the perception of the most average understanding. However we may show Hnmmarily that the earth is spheroidal, from the consideration that all things however distant tend to it11 centre, and that every body is 11ttrncted towards itH centre of gravity; this is more distinctly proved from obsarvations of the sea and sky, for here the evidence of the senses, and common obscrY11tion, is alone requisite. The convexity of tho sea is 11 further proof of this to those who have sailed; for they c11m1ot pe1·ceive lights at 11 distance when placed at the same fovcl as their eyes, but if raised on high, they at once hecomc perceptible to vision, though at the same time further removed. So, when the eye is raised, it sees what before was utterly imperceptible. Homer speaks of this when he says, "Lifted up on the vast wave he quickly beheld afar." Sailors, as they approach their destination, behold the shore continually raising itself to their view; and objects which had at first seemed low, begin to elevate themselves. Our gnomons, also, are, among other things, evidence of the revolution of the ha11venly bodies; 11ml common sense nt once shows us, that if the depth of thn earth were infinite, such 11 revolution could not take place. t However, so nice a fellow is Eratosthenes, that though he professes himself a m11thematici11n, lie rejects entirely tho dictum of Archimedes, who, in his work "On Bodies in Snspension," says that all liquids when left nt rest. assume a spherical form, having 11 center of gravity similar to that of the earth. A dictum which is aclrnowlcdged by all who have the slightest pretensions to mathematical sagacity. He says that the l\foditerranc11n, which, according to his own description, is one entire sea, has not the same level oven at points quite close to each other; nnd offers us the authority of engineers for this piece of folly, notwithstanding the affirmation of m11themat.iciaus that <1ngincering is itself only one division of the mathematics. He tells us that Demetrius intended to cut through the Isthmus of Corinth, to open a passage for hie fleet, but was prevented by his engineers, who, having taken mcasurnmcnts, reported that the }eye} of the sea at the Gulf of Corinth was higher than at Cenohrea, so that if he cut through the isthmus, not only the coasts near A~gin11, but even iEgina itself, with the neighbouring islands, would be laid completely under water, while th(I passage would prove of little v11lm,. According to Eratosthenes, it is this which occasions the current in straits, especially tho current in the Strnit of Sicily, where effects similar to tl11' tlow and ebb of the tide nre remarked. Thu current there chnugcs twice in the course of 11 day and night, like as in that period the tides of the son flow and ebb twice. In the Tyrrheniun sea the current which is called "Strabo, Geogrnphy (Hamilton and Falconer's translation, Bohn's Library), Bk. I, Ch. tGeog., Bk. I, Ch. I, ~ 20.

descendent, and which runs towards tho sea of Sicily, as if it followed an inclined plane, corresponds to the flow of the tido in the ocean. We may remark, that this current corresponds to the flow both in the time of its comml'ncement and cessation. For it commences at the rising 11nd setting ot' the moo11, and i·eccd<'S when that Hatellite attams its meridian, whether above [in the zenith] or helow tlrn earth [in the nadir]. In the same way occurs Urn opposite or a.~ceuding current, as it is called. It corresponds to the ebb of the uceg,u, and co111mc11ccs m1 soon aa th" moon has reached either zenith or nadir, and cea&es tho moment 11ho reaches tlH' point of her rising or Actting. [So far Eratusthen<'s.] The nature of tho ebb aud flow bas beeu sufficiently treated of by Posidonins aud Athenodorns. Concerning the flux and reflux of the currents, which also may ho explained by physics, it will suffice our present purpose to observe, that in the various straits these do not reHemble each other, but erich strait bas its own pec111i1tr current. Were they to resemble each other, the current at the Strait of Sicily would not change merely twice during the day, (as Eratosthenes himself tells us it does,) an!l at Chalcis sevon times; nor again that of Constantinople, which does not change at all, but runs always in one direction from the Euxinc to the Propontis, and, as Hipparchus tells 118, sometimes ceases altogether. However, if they did all depend on one cause, it would not be that which EratostheneA hae assigned, namoly, that the various semi have different levels. The kind of inequality ho supposes would not even he found in rivers only for the cataracts; and where these cataracts occur, they occasion no ebbing, but lnwe one continued downward flow, which is caused by the inclination both of the flow and the surface; and therefore though they have no flux or reflux they do nut romai11 still, on account of a principle of flowing which is inherent in them; at the Rame time they cannot be on the same level, bnt one mnst be higher a!lll one lower than another. But who ever imagined the surface of the ocean to be on 1t slope, e11pecially those who follow a system which supposes the four bodice we call elementary, to be spherical. For water is not like the earth, which being of It solid nature is capable of permanent dopre11sions and risings, but by its force of gravity spreads equally over the earth, and assumes that kind. of lorn! which Archimedes hue as11igued it.· Here arc n few of the facts ostnbliehcd by natural 1>hilosophcrs: The earth and heavens are spheroidal. The tendency of all bodies having weight, is to a centre. Further, the earth being spheroidal, and having tho same centre as the heavens, is motionless, as well as the axis which passes through both it and the heavens. The heavens turn round lioth the earth and its axis, f'rom east to west. The fixed stars turn round with it, at the same rate a!l the whole. These fixed stars follow in their course parallel circles; the principal of which arc, the equator, the two tropics, and the arctic circles. While th!' planets, the sun, and the moon, describe certain oblique circles comprehended within the zodiac, t

Elsewhere Strabo states that if we go west sufficiently far we shall reach India, unless some continent intervenl'Rj aud he suggests that there may be one or more such bodies of land on the parallel of Spain.+ He ascribes the great heat folt in the torrid zone to the perpendicularity of the sun's rays, and not to the sun's proximity. He says that all parts of the. earth are equally remote from the sun, since, in comparison with this body, the earth is but a point.§ The following quotations show that Strabo clearly discriminatetli. between "tidal waves" and ordinary or true tides. He considers "tidal waves" to be due to disturbances in the bottom of the sea.
But the risings of rivers are not violent and sudden, nor do the tides continue any length of time, nor occur irregularly; nor yet along the coasts of our se11 do they cause inundations, nor any where else. Com1eqnently we must seek for an explanation of tho cause II eitber in the Htratum composing tho bed of the sea, or in that which is ovl'r· flowed; we prefer to look for it in the former, since by reason of its humidity it is more liable to shiftings and sudden changes of position, and we shall find that in these matters the wirnl is the great agent after all. But, I repeat it, the immediate cause of these phenomena, is not in the fact of one part of the bed of the ocean being higher or lower than another, but in the upheaving or depression of the strata on which the waters rest.~ It is likewise evidently n fiction, that there ever occurred an overwhelming flood-tide, for the ocean, in the influences of this kind which it experiences, receives a certain settled and periodical increase and decrease.""

He does not, however, state what he regards as the physical cause of the tides, although he bas already hinted at vapors surrounding the heavenly bodies. He merely, after Athenodorus likens the plieuomeuon to the breathing of a living creature, as do the poets of to·day.tt
For after the manner of li\'ing creatures, which go on inhaling and exhaling their breath <'Ontinually, sea in a like way keeps up a cow1t.ant motion in and out of itself. *Geog., Bk. I, Ch. III, ~§ 11, 12. tGeog., Bk. II, Ch. V, § 2. tGcoir., Bk. I, Ch. IV, ~6. 9Geog., Ilk. XV, Ch. I, 924.

He rleseribes the tides around Spain and Portugal,"' the Persian Gulf,t England,t Italy,§ and De11111arl<.1I The following account of the tides at Cadiz describes the phase inequality and properly connects it with the age of the moon, but tho description of a supposed annual increase (in range) has been doubtless based upon insufficient observations:
Now he 1) assorts that the motion of the sea correspornls with the revolution of the heavenly bodies, and experiences a diurnal, monthly, and annual change, in strict accordance with tho changes of the moon. For [ho co11tinues] when the moon is elevated one sign of the zodiac abo\'e tho horizon, tho sen begins sensibly to swell and cover the shores, until she has attained her meridian; hut when thnt satellite begins to decline, the sea a~nin retires hy degrees, until the moon wants merely one sign of tile zodiac from setting; it then remains stationary until t.lle moon has set, an1l alHo descended 011e sign of the zodiac h!llow the horizon, when it again rises until she has attained her meridian below tho earth; it then retires again until the moon is within one 1:1ign of the zodiac of her rising above tho horizon, when it remains stationary until the moon bas risen one sign of tho zodiac above the earth, nml then begins to rise as before. Such he describes to be the diurnal revolution.·· In re!lpect to the monthly revolution, [be says] that the spring-ti1les occur at the time of the new moon, when they decrease until tho first quarter; they then increase until full moon, when they again decrease until the last quarter, after which they increase till the new moon; [he adds] that these increases ought to be understood both of their duration nnd speed. In regard to the annual revolution, he says that he learned from the statements of the Gnditanians, that both the ebb and flow tides were at their extremes at the summer solstice: and that hence he conjectured that they decreased until the [autumnal] equinox; then increased till the winter solstice; then decreased again until the vernal equinox; and [finally] increased until the summer solstice. tt

The following quotation refers to a condition of flood-tide resembling a bore:
For in the navigation of thC\ rivers, tt the sailors run considerable dangei· both in ascending and descending, owing to the violence with which the :flood-tide encounters the current of the stream as it flows down. Tho ebhtides are likewise the cause of much damage in these estuaries, for resulting ns they do from thC\ same cause nH the flood-tides, they are frequently so rapid as to leave the vessel on dry land; and he1;:Is in passing over to the islands that are in these estuaries are sometimes drowned [in the passage] and sometimes surprised in the islands, and endeavouring to cross back again to the continent, are unable, and perish in the attempt. H

Strabo is the first writer who gives, although incredulously and upon the authority of others, some account of the tropic tides and the diurnal inequality :1111
Posidonius tells us that Seleucus, a native of the country next the Erythrman Sea, states that the regularity and irregularity of tho ebb and How of the sea follow the different positions of the moon in the zodiac; that when she is in the equinoctial signs tho tides are regular, but that when she is in the signs next the tropics, the tides are irregular both in their height and force; and that for the remaining signs the irregularity is greater or less, according as they are more or less removed from the signs before mentioned. Posidonius adds, that during the summer solstice and whilst the moon was fnll;he himself passed many days in the temple of Hercules at Gades, but could not observe any thing of theso annual irregularities.1)1)

In reforenct. to the annual inequality in water level, it may be of interest to here quote from Strabo some passages concerning the periodic stages of the Nile and the rivers of India:
Of this kind are tlw rising of the Nile, and the alluvial deposition at its mouth. There is nothing in the whole country to which travellerH in Egypt so immediately direct their inquiries, as the character of the Nile; nor 1!0 the inhabitants possess any thing else equally womlerfnl and curious, of which to inform foreigners; for in fact, to give them a description of the river, is to lay open to their view e\·er~' main characteristic of the country, It is the question put before eve1·y other by those who have never seen Egypt themselves.*'* *Geog., Bk.

The nilometer is a well upon the banks of the Nile, oonstructecl of close-fitting stones, on which are marked the greatest, least, and mean risrngs of th<i Nile; for tho water in the well and in the river rises and subsides simultaneously. Upon the wall of the well are lines, which indicate the complete rise of tile river, ancl other degrees of its rising.

For it is known long ueforc, by these marks, an<1 by the ti1ue elapsed from the commencement, what the futuro rise of the river will be, and notice Is given of it.

It is of use also to the governors, who fix the revenuo; for the grouter the rise of the river, the great(lr it it1 expected will be the rnvenne.~

This pasRage is of interest in reference to tide gauges and tidal prediction.
68. Plutarch (fl.. 50-100 A. D.) gives the theories of several philo8ophers concerning the cause

of tbe tides, but bis.remarks on Pytheas show his unfamiliarity with the phenomenon.

He says:

Aristotle and Heraclides say, they proceed from the sun, which moves and whirls about the winds; and these falling with 1~ violence upon the Atlantic, it is pressed und swells by them, by which means the sea flows; ancl their unpression ceasing, the sea retmcts, hence they ebb. Pytheat1 the Massilian, that the fulncss of the moon gives the the flow, the wane the oub. Plato attributes it all to a certain oscillation of the sea, which hy moans of a mouth or orifice causes the alternate ebb and ffow; and by this means the seas do rise and flow contrarily. 'fimmus believes that those rivers which foll from the mountains of the Celtic Gaul into the Atl1mtic produce a tide. For upon their entering upon that sea, they violently press upon it, and so cause the tlow; but they disembogning themselves. there is a cessation of the impetuousness, hy which means the ebb is produced.II Seleucus the mathematician attributes a motion to the earth; an1l thus be pronouncoth that the moon in its circumlation meets and repels the earth in its motion; between these two; the earth and the moon, there is a vehement wind raised and intercepted, which rushc11 upon the Atlantic Ocean, and gives us a probable argument that it is the cause the sea is troubled and moved.~

While Plutarch states that most philosophers have regarded the earth as an animal, be says nothing about ascribing tbe tides to its respiration or to its alternate drinking in and spouting out a certain portion of the water. Such notions were entertained by tlrn Stoics Solinus, Apollonius of Tyana, and others. (See under Pomponius Mela ancl under Kepler,§§ 70, 77.) It cannot be said that the Greeks, as a rule, had occasion to become familiar with tidal phenomena on any impressive scale. But the Romans, toward and after the time of Oresar, had frequently to contend with those enormous tides which visit the coasts of Portugal, France, and Great Britain.
69. Pliny the Elder (23-79 .A. D.).

Pliny describes, in the following extract taken from his Natural History, 0 the principal phenomena of the tides. It will be seen that be is aware of a nearly constant lunitidal interval for a given place; of the pllase inequality; of tlle retard, or age, of this inequality; of tlle fact that higher tides occur near the equinoxes than near the solstices; and of the fact that the tides on the outer coast rise higher than .those along the shores of the Mediterranean.
Much has been sni<l about the nature of waters; but the most wonderful drcumstauco is the alternate flowing aml ebbing of the title~, which exists, indeed, under various forms, bnt is ca.ut1e1l by tho sun au<l the moon.

First, the moon rising with the stars swells out the tide, and after some time, having gained the summit of the heavens, she declines from the meridian and sets, and tho tide subsides. Again, after she has set, and moves in the hca\'ens under the oarth, as she approaches the meridian on the opposit<' side, the tide flows in; after which it recedes until she again rises tons. But the tide of the next tiny is ne\'er at the samo time with that of the preceding; as if the planet was in attendance, greedily drinking up the sou., and continually rising in a different place from what she clid the day before. The intervals are, however, <1qual, heing always of six hours; not indeed iu respect of any particular day or night or place, but equinoctial hours,· and therefore they aro unequal as estimated by the length of couimon hours, since a greater number of them fall o0n some certain days or nights, and they are nover .. qual twerywhere except at the equinox. This is a great, most clear, and e\'en divine proof of the dullness of those, who deny that the stars go below the earth and rise up agniu, and that nature presents the same face in tho same states of their rising and setting; for the course of the stars is equally obvious in the one case as in the other, producii:g the same effect as when it is manifest to the sight. There is a difference in the tides, depending on the moon, of a complicatetl nature, and, first, as to the period of seven days. For the tides are of moderate height from the new moon to the first quarter; from this time they increase, and nre tho highest nt the full: they then decrease. On the seventh day they are equal to wl1nt they were at the first quarter, and they again increase from the time that she is at first quarter 011 the other Hide. At her conjunction with the sun they are equally high as at the full. When the moon is in the northern hemisphere, and recedes further from the earth, the tides are lower than when, going toward the south, she cxercise8 her influence ut a less distance. After un interval of eight yeani, and the hundredth re\·olution of the moon, the periods and the heights of the tides return into tho sn.me order as at first, this plauet always acting upon them; and all these effects are likewise increased by tho annual changes of the sun, tho tides rising up higher nt the oquinoxeH, and more so at the autumnal than at the vernal; while they are lower about the win tor solstice, and Rtill more so at the summer Holstice; not indeed precisely at the points of ti mo which I have mentioned, lmt a few days after; for example, not exactly at the full nor .at the new moon, but after them; and not immediately when the moon becomes visible or invisible, or has advan<"ed to the middle of her course, but generally about two hours latnr than the eq uiuoctial hours; the effect of what is going on in the heavens being felt after a short iuterval; as we observe with ros11ect to lightniug, thunder, nnd thunderbolts. But the tides of the ocean cover greater spaces and produce greater inundations than the tides of the other seas; whether it be that the whole of the universe taken together is more full of life.than its individual parts, or that the large open space fotJls more sensibly the power of the iilanot, as it moves freely about, thau wheu restrained within narrow bounds. On which account ueithcr lakeR nor rh·ers are moved iu the same manner. Pythons of Massilia informs us, that in Britain the tide rises 80 cubits. Inland seas u.re inclosed us in a harbor, but, in some parts of them, there is a mom free space which obeys the influence. Among mauy other examples, the force of the tide will carry us in three days from Italy to Ctica, when the sea is tranquil and there is no impulse from the sails. But these motions are more felt about tho shores thau in the deep parts of the seas, as in the body the extremities of the nlius feel the imlse, which is the vital spirit, more than the other parts. And in most estuaries, on account oft.he unequal rising of the stars in ench tract, the tides differ from each other, but this respects the period, not the nature of them; as is tho case in tho Syrtes. There are, however, some tides which are of a peculiar nature, ns in the Tauromenian Euripus, whore the ebb anti 11ow is more frequent than in other plu.cos, antl in Eubooa, where it takes place se\'en times during the day and the night. The tides intermit three times during en.ch month, being the 7th, 8th, and !)th day of the moon. At Gades, which is very near the temple of 1-Ieroules, there is a spring inclosed IiktJ a well, which sometimes rises and falls with the ocean, aml, nt other times, in both respects contrary to it. In the same place there it1 another well, which always agrees with the oc"u.n. On the shores of the Bwtis, there is a "town whert· tho wells become lower when the tide riSllH, and fill again when it ebbs; while at other times they remain stationary. The same thing occurs in one well in the town of Hispalis, while there is nothing peculiar in the other wells. The Euxine always flows into the Propontis, the water noYer flowing back into the Euxine. All seas are purified at the full moon; some also at stated periods. At :\Icssina and Mylne a refuse matter, like dung, is cast up on the shore, whence originated the story of the oxen of the sun ha\'ing had their stable nt thnt place. To what has been said ubovo (not to omit anything with which I am acquainted) Aristotle adds, th1't no animal dies except wht!ll. the tide is ebbing. Tho ohsorvation has be(ln often made on the ocean of Gaul; but it has only been found true with respect to man. Hence we may certainly conjoctnre, that the moon is not unjustly regarded ns the star of our lifo. This It is tlrnt replenishes the earth; when she approaches it, she fills o.11 bodies, while, when she recedes, she empties them. t From this cause it is that shell-fish grow with her increase, and thnt those animals which nro without blood more particularly experience her influeuce; also, that the blood of mun is increased or diminished in proportion to the quantity of her light; also, that tho loaves and vegetables generally, as I shall describe in the proper place, feel her influence, her power penetrating nil things.

70. Information about tides common to the .Romans. That the rising and falling of the tide was common knowledge among the Homans may be readily seen by cornmlting Latin-English lexicons under such words as "mstus" and "tumesco."

Virgil· (70-19 B. 0.) and Horace+ (65-8 B. 0.) make some mention of the phenomenon; but Cicero:j: (lOG-4;) B. 0.), Lucan§ (39- - A. D.), and Claudianus II (ft. c. 400 A.

D.) even states that the equinoctial tides when the moon and sun are in conjunction generally exceed in size all others. 'l'his is much more nearly true than Pliny's statement that tides rise higher at the equinoxes, for it is the spring (ides which partake of this semiannual incr·ease.tt Pompouius Mela (IL c., 50 A.

Exercita.tio I1II, t entitled "De ma.ris motn," is a general exposition of the tides, the views therein suggested, taken in connection with the time at which it was written, give to it considerable historic value. Without professing to know the cause of the tides, Scaliger remarks that because the flow and ebb recur at.<I°efinite and stated times, the moving cause must be definite in character. Bis approach to the gravitational theory of tides appears in the following quotation:
For since [the tide] is observed to follow the course of the moon, they have jUtlged it created by the moon. [You say] but the moon does not touch the waters. This has been a difficulty with some of the Peripatetics: likewise tho magnet onght to ~ive them <lifllcnlty. llocause there is motion in the iron, although not in contact with the stone, wherefore ma:v not the soa follow the body of the noblest orb~ llut it Reems manifest. Surely there is a stillness of the sea at the times of the quadrntureM which is called 11 calm by the people. At the times of fnll moon the seas are rougher: so that the~· Heern to restrain themselves with the desire of the moon. . . . The tide then, in the usual sense of the word, is a duplex motion, and truly duplex: for in itself is a return. One part is in conformity with tho motion of the prin1111n mobile, the other is recurrent nud contrary thereto: hut both occur on definite times. For there are two motions just as int.he contraction and expansion of the heart.

He inters a declinational inequality in the tides because the moon chang·es her declination and so rises not always in the same place. He believes the long stretch of the Western Continent to explain the alternation of flow and ebb. As with most of the early writers he 1inds difficulty in aecounting for the ebb:

Cresar Fredericke, Marchant of Venice, into the East India, and beyond the Indies . . translated out of Italian by l\1. Thomas Ilickocke. [1563. j ~
From Martauan I departed to goo to the chiefest Ci tie in tho kingdome of Pegu, which i!l also called after tho name of the kingdomo, which voyage is made by sea in throe or foure <laies; they may goo also by lando, but it is bettor for him that hath marchandizo to goe by sea and lesser charge. And in thi!l voyage you shall lmuo a Macareo, which is oue of the most marueilous things in the world that Nature hath wrought, and I nener saw any thing so har<l to he belPetied as this, to wit, the great increasing & diminishing of the water there at one push or instant, and tl1e horrible earthquake and great' noyse that the said .Macareo maketh where it commoth. We departed from l\lartauan in barke~, which are like to our Py lot boates, with the increase of the water, and they goo as swift a8 an arrow out of a. bow, so long as the tide runnoth with them, and when tho water is at tho highest, then they drawo themseluos out of the Chanell towardes some banke, and there they come to anker, and when the water is diminishecl, then they rest on dry land: and when tho bnrkos rest dry, they are as high from tho bottomo of the Chanell, as any house top iH high from the ground. They Jet their barkos lie so high for this respect, that if there should any shippe rest or ride in tho Chanell, with such force commeth in tho water, that it would onerthrowo shippe or harke: yet for all tliis, that tho barkes be so farre out of the Chanell, uud though the water hath lost her greatest strength and furie before it come HO high, yet they make fast their prowe to the streme, and oftentimes it makcth them very fearofull, and if the auker di<l not holt!e her J>row vp by strength, shoe would be ouerthrowen and lost with men and goods. 'Vhen tho water beginneth to increase, it maketh such a noyse and so great that you would thinke it an earthquake, and presently at the first it maketh three wanes. So that the first washeth oner the barko, from stemme to sternu, the Rocond is not so furious as the first, ancl tho thircle rayseth tho Anker, and then for tho space of sixe houros while the water encreaseth, they rowe with such swiftnesse that you woul<l thinko they <lid fly: in these tydes there must ho lost no iot of time, for if you arriue not at the stagions before tho tyde be spent, you must turne backo from wlrnnce ~·ou came. For there is no staying at any place, but at those stagions, and there is more danger at one of these placoH then at another, as they be higher an<l lower one then another. 'Vhen us you returno from Pegn to Martauun, they goo but halfe the tide at a time, because they will lay their barkes vp aloft on the bankes, for the reason aforesay1l. [ could nener gather any reason of the noyse that this water makoth in tho increase of tho tide, and in <ieminishing of the water. There is another Macareo in Cambaya, but that is nothing in compari!lon of this. t

76. Francis Bacon (1561-1626). The chief merit of Bacon's essay entitled "De ftuxn et refiuxu maris," apart from its suggestions of inquiry into the tides of various countries, is the insistence upon the progressive character of the tide causing it to move from place to place; that is, the waters do not boil up, as it were, a11d produce everywhere simultaneous tides. He thinks, however, that the semimenstrual and semiannual inequalities may occur everywhere simultimeonsly, or at least upon the same day. He says:
That this .. should be <lone so quickly, namely, twice a day; as if the narth, aeconling to that foolish conceit of Apollonius, were taking respiration, and breatbiug out water ev(lry six hours and then taking it in again: is a very great clifficnlty.

lie notes that this simultaneous rising is not proven from reports concerning certain wells, nor even from the (then supposed) fact that tides are simultaneous at Florida and the coasts of Europe. He remarks that this may result naturally enough from the tide coming from the Indian Ocean around southern Africa. Besides the sexhorary motion, the semimonthly, and the semiannual, "whereby the tides receive a great and remarkable increase at the equinoxes," he mentions a monthly motion which he may have indistinctly connected with the moon's parallax. He believes the earth to stand fixed while all of the universe outside, including the air and waters of the sea, has a tendency westward,-the heayenly bodies moving much more rapidly than the air or the waters of the sea. He believes that the two coutinents so obstruct the tidal waters,

which would otherwise progress uniformly but slowly from east to west around the earth, that their progressive motion is converted into a motion whose period is a half lunar day; also, that, because of this westward motion, those gulfs or bays which open eastward should have larger tides than similar bodies of water opening westward. Concerning the coincidences in the periods of the tides aud of the heavenly bodies h~ says:
Yet it will not immediately follow (and we would ha1·e men observe this) tlmt things which correspond in the course and periods of time, or even in the manner of carriage, are in their nature An\Jordiuato, and tlrn cause one of the other. For I do not go so far as to assert that the motions of the moou or sun are Bet down us the camies of the inferior motions which are analogous to tht·m, or that tho sun and moon (as is commonly said) have dominion over tlwse motions of the sea (though such though ts easily fintl entrance into men's minds by reason of thllir veneration for he:wenly bodies); indeed in that very half-monthly motion (if rightly observed) it would be :i very strange and novel kind of o\Jedieuce, for the tides at the new and full moon to he affected in the same way, while the moon is affected in opposite ways; aud mauy other things might be atlducotl which would destroy these fancies about dominations, antl leail us rather to conclutlti that these corres1)011tlences arise out of tho universal passions of matter, and the primary combinations of things, not as if one were governed by tho other, hut that both emanate from the same origins anti follow causes. Nevertheless (however it \Je) what I have said remains true, that nature delights in correspondences, and scarce admits anything unique or solitary.·

77. William Gilbert (1540-1G03). Gilbert, in his New Philosophy,· asserts that the moon earth have a. mutual attraction for each other analogous to magnetic attraction; that the tides are produced hy this force of the moon and not by its rays or its light. He cannot see how the ebbiug or the tide follows from the direct attraction u11less the interior of the earth contain lrnmors which retreat into the earth when the tide forces cease, and so cause the surface of the St'a to descend. He finds difficulty also i11 understandi11g why earth and moon do not fall together. ,John Kepler (1571-1630). As early as 1598, Kepler took exception to the views of Galileo concerning the cause of the tides. In the introduction to the Cosmographical Mystery he says:
aiHl

For he who attributes the motion of tho soaH to the motion of tho earth, clearly assumes a violent motion; \Jut lie who says that tho seas adhere to the moon, makes in i1art a natural assumption.t

In his Foundations of Astrology (1602) he asserts, in 'l'hesis 15, that, as proven by experience, all things swell up with the waxing moon and subside when she is waning. This foreknowledge is useful in housekeeping, farming, medicine, and navigation. But he says:
Physicists have not yet fully ascertained the reason for this sympathy.§

In Thesis 47 be likens the circulation of the waters of the earth to the circulation of living animals, and suggests that the observations of many years must needs be collated in order to investigate any long-period circulation which may exist. He says:
lleroupon Caesius attributes 11omethiug to the nineteen-year cycle of tho moon; from whom, indectl, all faith cau not be taken away. For mari11er11 say the greatest tides return upon the same days of the year after tho period of rn rears; and the moon, loade1l with vapors, soemH snita\Jlc for this purpose, hccause Hho possl!.sses either au excess or a tloticit of moisture.II

This is probably the first. hint at a rn year inequality in the tides. Pliny supposetl an i11ec1uality of 100 lunar months to (·xist. in the introduction to tlw Motions of the Pla11ct l\Iars, Kepler lays down the followi ug axioms concerning gravitation and the cause of tlie tides (160!1). Ue is the first to assert that the attractive forces exercised by earth and moon upon each other are proportional to their respective masses.
Therefore the true doctrine of gravity depemhi upon these axioms: Any corporeal substance, Hl'oing that it 18 corporeal, 1s b_v 11atnre destined to rest in any place, in which it is placed alone outside tho Rpht,re of virtut' of a cognate hody.

Therefore wherovor tho earth is locatotl or wherevnr it is transported by its animal faculty, heavy bodies are always drawn towartl it. If tho earth he not round, heavy bodies will not be borne from evorywhero straight to the middle point of tho earth, but will be borne to diverse points from diversn sides.

If the earth 8hould cease to attract its waters, all marine waters would be elevated and would flow into the body of the moon. The sphern of the attracting virtue, which is in the 1110011, extends t.o the earth and incites the waters under tlw Torrie I Zone, bec1mse of its mooting [with tlwm] wheresoernr she happens to be in the zenith of the pla<'e; [they are incitecl] insonsibl~· in ouclosocl sea8, but sensibly where thorn nro v1iry broad beds of tho ocean, aucl abundant libert.y of reciprocation for the waters; hy which caus11 tho shores in the zones ancl neighboring l'li111es are ma<lo bare a1Hl on~n as far as tho Torrid Zone, tho neighboring ocoans cause tho waters of gulfs t.o bo more reclucecl. Therefore iu a. broader hod of the ocean, tho waters being in motion, it may happen that in its more nnrrow gulfs, provided not. too closely confined, the waters, when tlw moon is present, may eveu soem to 1loe from hor: in fact, they snbsido when th!' abundance of water is diminisheel outsiclo.

In the fourth 'book of his Ifarmonics t (161!.)) Kepler likens the ti<le to the breathing- of terrestrial animals and especially to the breathing of fishes; but it does not follow from this that he renounced his earlier views. Of those who attributed the tides to some attraction of the moon analogous t-0 magnetic attraction, may be mentioned, Scaliger, Gilbert, the College of Jesuits at Coimbra, Antonio dt>. Dominis, and Stevin. 78. Galileo Ga.lilci ( 1564-1642). The fqurth dialogue of Galileo's System of thB World is devoted to the discussion of the tides. His object is to show that they are dne to the non-uniform motion (in space) of the particles of the sea and solid eartll, aml that their presence goes to prove the earth's axial rotation and its motion around the sun.§ Since the earth turns from west to east an cl also moves eastward in its orbit, the actual mot.ion of a place in the nighttime must 'be greater than the actual motion of the same place in the daytime; hence the diurnal acceleration and retardation of the otherwise uniform motion in space of any given sea, and hence the tidal cause whose period is a solar day. Galileo does not realize that the tides call for the lunar instead of the solar day. In HilG Kepler points out to Galileo that the lunar day should be taken.II He notices that there are several "varieties" of tidal movements depending upon the localities. Considerable tides may be accompanied by weak currents or 'by strong currents, and small tides may be accompanied 'by strong currents, as happens around several islands of the Mediterranean. Such "varieties" he tliinks would be present if a vessel (like the Mediterranean Sea) 'be subjected to a non·uniform movement, 'but not otherwise. He notices that (analogous to the pendulum) the nn<lulations of waters in short vessels are more frequent than in long vessels; also that an increa,;e or tleptil increases their frequency.,l

In reference to certain other hypotheses the dialogue reads:·
And there dwelleth not many miles from hence a famous Peripatetick, that alledgeth a cause for the t1arne newly fishod out of a certain Text of AriBtotle, not well understood by his Expositors, from which Text he collectet!J, that the true cause of these motions doth only proceed from the different profundities of Seas: for that the waters of greatest depth being greater in abundance, and therefore more grave, drive back the Waters of lessc depth, w!Jich being afterwards raised, desire to deHcend, and from this continual collnctation or contest proceedH the ebbing and Jlowing. Again those t!Jat reforre the same to the Moon are many, saying that she hath particular Dominion over the Wat-0r; and at last a certain Prelatet hath published a little Treatise, wherein ho saith that the moon wandering too and fro in the Heavens attracteth and draweth towards it a Masse of Water, which goetb continually followi11g it, so that it is full Sea alwayes in that part which lyeth under the Moo11; and because, that though she be under the Horizon, yet nevertheless the Tide returneth, he Raith that no more can be said for the salving of that particular, save onely, that the Moon doth not onely naturally rntain this faculty in her self; but in this case hath power to confer it upon that degree of the Zodiack that is opposite unto it. Others, as I believe you know, do say that the Moon is able with her temperate heat to rarefie the 'Vater, which being rarefied, doth thereupon flow.

Later on in the dialogue still other theories are referred to. Galileo's indistinct notion of the tidal period and his contempt for the idea that the moon is the principal cause of the tides may be gathered from the following extracts:
The period of six hours therefore is no more proper or natural than those of other intervals of times, though indeed its the most observed, as agreeing with our Mediterrane, which was the onely Sea that for many Ages was navigated: though neither is that period obsen·ed in all its parts; for that in some more august plac6!!, such as urn the llelleBpont, and the .!Egean Sea, the periods are much shorter, and also very divers amongst themselves; for which diversities, and their causes incomprehensible to A1°istotle, some say, that after he had a long time observed it upon some diffes of Xegropont, being 1Jrought to desperation, he throw himself into the adjoyning Eurip11s, and voluntarily drowned himtmlf. Now follow the two other Periods, Monthely, and Annual, which do not bring with them new and different Accidents, otlwr than those already conHidered in the diurnal Period; but they opera.to on the same Acciclents, by rcndring them greater and lesser in several parts of the Lunar :Monet.h, and in several times of the Solar Year; as if that the Moon and Sun did each conceive it self apart in operating and producing of those Effects; a thing that totally ela.sheth with my uuderstanding, which seeing how that this [movement) of Seas is a local and sensible motion, made in an immense mass of Water, it cannot be brought to subscribe to Lights, to temperate Heats, to predominacies by occult Qu1ilities, and to such like vain Imaginations, that are so far from being, or being possible to be Causes of the Tide; that on the contrary, the Tide is the cause of them, that is, of bringing them into the brains moro apt for loquacity and ostentation, than for the speculation aml disco,·ering of the more abstruse secrets of Nature; which kind of people, before they can be brongh't to prononnce that wise, ingenious, and modest sentence, I know it not, suffer to escape from their mouths and pens all manner of extravagancies.

Galileo thinks the monthly inequality due to a supposed retardation and acceleration in the earth's orbital motion, caused by the moon being alternately outside and inside of the earth's orbit, and his reason for this is that distant bodies have longer periodic times of revolution about the sun than near ones. He believes that this irregularity of motion may be too small to have been observed by astronomers and yet sufficiently great for producing the tides.
But how each Planet governeth itself in its particular revolution, and how precisely the structure of its Orb is framed; which is that which is vulgarly called the Theory of the I'lonetB, we cannot as yet undoubtedly resolve. But amongst all the famous mon that have philosophated upon this admirable effect of Nature, I more wonder at J(cplcr than any of the rest, who being of a free and piercing wit, and having the motion ascribetl to the Earth, before him, hath for all that given his ear and assent to the llloons prodominaney over the Water, and to occult properties, and such like trifles.

Because of its author, the system' of Galileo attained recognition from uumerous sources. (15!l2-1655), in his De ~'Estu Maris follows Galileo iu the main; and it appears by ltis later writings that Kepler may in part have renounced his own more rational views. Hiccioli explains Galileo's system at considerable length; the attempts of Balianus and Wallis in this direction are given below. Fournier at times, in his Hydrographie, resumes Galileo's theory as modified by Gassendi, but he was not altogether pleased with it. In justice to Galileo it should be added that lie at one time contemplated a treatise on the theory of tides, but that his religious persecutors rendered it well-nigh impossible for him to co11tinue his scientific work.

79. John Baptist Riccioli (1598-1671). In the second, fourth, and nintll books of his Almagestum Novum,· H.iccioli treats of the tides. Galileo's system or theory is explained and refuted at some length. Ile quotes the theses laid down by Kepler, and mentions a great number of other theories both ancient and modern, thus giving much historic value to his work. Wccioli divi1les the ordinary motions of the sea into three classes: 1\Iotion in latitude, in longitude, a11d in height. TJ1e last he regards as the tide-the <estus or theflux·us ac rejiu:cus. The motious from eai;;t to west are real or supposed ocean currents, but the north-and-south motions are, at least in part, tidal. For example, he speaks of their period being twenty-four hours around the J.\folucca and Philippine Islamhi. He gives some account of the tides of Europe including tile Mediterranean Sea, and makes some mention of tile tides in America. For example, he states that at the island of l\Iartiuique and in the Caril>l>ean Sea the sea rises scarcely 1 foot. Ile gives a tal>le showing for various localities the times of high water at new and full moon; also a table, after Fournier, showing the times of tide for each day of the month. The values upon successive days generally become later by 48 minutes and recur after an.interval of 15 dap;. John Baptist Bcilianus. t This writer undertakes to supplement the most obvious defect. of Galileo's theory by supposing the moon to describe the orl.lit about the sun, and the earth to aecompany the moon revolving al.lout the latter every month. 'l'his would give alternate accelerations and retardations in motions in space of any given point of the earth, and the period would lie a lunar instead of a solar day. Later, Dom .Jacques A1exandre, Beuedictine, in a paper on tides which took the prize of the .:\(':ulemy of Bor<leaux in 1726 adopts the hypothesi8 of Ba.lianus. l\1. de l\Iairau refutes this in the l\I1;111oires de l'Academie, 1727 . ·Je1·c111iah llorro.r (c. 1619-l<i40). Horrox, the astronomer, observed tides for three months in HHO short]~· l.lefore bis death, which occurred when be was only 21 or 22 years of age.
Jlorro"k" appears to havo heon tho first person who nn<lcrtook tho prosecution of n. continuous course of obscrrntious of the tides, for tho express purpose of obtaining a series of facts which might form the ground work of n. philosophical investigation of tho 1rnbject. t

It seems, however, that the heights of remarkably high tides upon the Thames have l.leen recorded ever since the Norman conquest,§ and that Caudale made in 1575 several observations 011 the tides at the mouth of the Garonne.11 80. Ren<f Descartes (15UG-1650). Ju tl.JC fourth part ofl1is Principles of Philosophy, Descartes attempts (c. 1G4·1) to explain the tides in accordance with his il.JCory of the movements of the heavenly bodies set forth in the third part. According to the vortex theory, the sun, being at the center of tlle solar system and surroun1led by a l.loundless fluid, does, by its axial rotation, set in motion the fluid layer arijacent to it; this layer imparts its motion to the adjoining layer; this in tnru to the next, all(l so on to the distant parts of space. The planets placed in their respective flui1l layers are in this way carried al.lout the sun. Similarly, each planet, because of its axial rotation, is the center of a secondary vortex system. In tllis are involved not only the satellites attending the planet, l>ut likewise the air :111d water by whicll it is surrounded. By meaus of the intervening flnid, he supposes the 1110011 to exert a pressure upon the atmosphere and, in some way, produce the tides, low water when she is npon the meridian and high water when UO degrees distant. Ile supposes that spring tides are dne to the moon's approaching the earth in a syzygy, and tllat neap tides are due to her receding from the earth when in quadrature. The vortex theory of the universe appealed to the popular imagination, because there seemed to lie no occult or unfamiliar properties of matter involved. It exerted a consideral>le influence for al.lout one hundred years. '.rhe last honor paid to it by the Academy of Sciences of Paris was in the ~·ear 1740 when the essay of Cavalieri received a prize along with the essays of Bernoulli, ::\l:wlaurin, and Euler.

UNITED STATES COAST .AND GEODETIC 8URVEY.

In Propositions LII and LIII, Bk. II, .Newton shows the inability of the vortex theory to account for the planetary motions. For, in order that the planets be so carried, their periodic times must be as the squares of their distances from the sun, and, moreover, their densities must be the same as that of the surrounding fluid. As already noted (§GG), Seleucus held a view somewhat similar to that of Descartes. Among writers upon tides who adopted this explanation are Vareuius and Jacques Cassini. 81. Rernhardus Varfmius or Renilutnl Varen (IG~2-1G70). The Geographia Genernlis of Varenius appeared in lli:10; in 1733 the work was translated into English by Dugdale,* aml it is from this that the following quotations upon the subject of the tides are taken. Although apparently 11ot satisfied with Descartes's explanation, he accepts it, with some amendments, as the most platrnible one known to him. He states that, as shown by observation, water bas but one natural motion, viz. from a higher tn a lower place; also that1'/te 9mwral 21/otion of the Sra ia twofold; the one is co11sta11t, a111l from EaHf. to Trest: fhP, othm· is eompo·ed of two contra1·y Jlotions, and called the Plu.r and Reflux of the Sea, by 11·hieh, at certain l!o111··, -it ,tlou's towards the shores, and at othe1·s back a!Jai11.

lie instances numerous straits where the east-to-west motion is very strong.
The Cause of I/tis !fcneral 1llotion of the Sea from East to ll'est is 1111c1rtain.

THE Aristottdians (tho' neither they, nor their :\laHter, nor any Europra11 Philosopher, bad the least Kotion of tbPso Things, befor<3 the l'o1·tugn1·He Hailed thro' tho ocean in the Ton·id Z01w) HuppoHe, that it is causetl b~· the Prime .Motion of the HeaYons, wllich is common not only to all tlw St11r8, but eYen, in part, to the Air and Oceau; and by which they, and all things, are carried from East to \Vest. Some Copernicans (as ](eplcr, etc.), altho' they acknowledge tho .Moon, to be the prime canse of this Motion, yet they make the ;\lotiou of the Enrth not a little contribute to it, by reason that the Water, boing not joined to the earth, but eoutiguous only, cannot keep up with it's cptick Motion towards the East; but is retanle1l and left towaru the West; ancl so the 8ca is not moved from one Part of the Earth to another, but the Earth leaves tlrn Parts of the Sea one after another. OTHERS, who are satisfied with neither of these Causes, have recourse to tho Moon; which they will have to be the Go,·erness of all Fluids, ancl therefore to draw the Ocean round with her from East to \Vest. If yon ask, bow she performs thisf They answer, it is, by an occult Quality, a certain Influence, a Sympathy, her Vicinity to the Earth, and such like. It is \'ery probable indeed the Moon, some way or other, causes thi8 l\Iotion, lHJcauee it is observed to be much more violent at the New ancl Full Moon, than about the Quadratures, when it is, for the most Po.rt, but small. THE ingenious des Ca1·tcs mechanically explains how the Moon may cause this ;\lotion, both in the \Vater, aud the Air.

He then attempts to explain this motion by Descartes's theory. After attempting to derive the phenomenon of the tides froni considering tl1e westward flowing current be says:
HENCE we muy determine, that the Flnx and Reflux of the Sea is no way distinct from that general ::\lotion, which we explained in the former Proposition, whereby the Ocean is perpetually moved from East to West; for it ie only a certain ::llocle or Property of tbut Motion. ·
To t'xplai11 tlw Cause of the Swelling a11d Swagin!f of the Sea, vulgarly called it's Flux and Reflux. .

THERE is no Ph:Pnornenon in Nature that bas so much excrcisecl and puzzlecl the \Vite of Philosophers and learnecl Men m1 this. Some have thought the Earth u11Cl Sea to be a lh·ing Creature, which, by it's Respiration, eauscth this ebbing and flowing.

Soaliger, and others, supposc<l that it is canHccl by the opposite Shores, especially of America, whereby the general ;\lotion of the Sua is obstrnctc<l and reverberated. But most Philosophcra, who have obsen·ed tho Harmony that those Tides have with the Moon, have given their Opiuiou, that they aro entirely owing to the Inllneuce of that Luminary. But the Question is, what is this luJlueucei To which they only answer, that it is an occult Quality, or Sympathy, whereby the J\loCln attracts all moist BodieR. But iht·8o are only "'or1ls, and Riguify no more than that tho l\Joon docs it by i;ome means or other, but they do not know how: \Vhich is the Thiug we want.

Having noted that greater tides happen at tho syzygies than at tlle quadratures because the moon is nearer to t.he earth in the first instance, he says:

Nor cun it be otherwise explained, why at tho Full llloon Vegetnbles uud Animals aro impregnated with a greater quantity of Son Moisture, thnn at the New, tho' eYen thou the Tides nre evor,v whit us high. It is vory wonderful what one 1'wi8t, n J>11tch1111w, relates in his Description of 1111/ia. He 1-mys, thut in the Kingdom of G11::ai·at (where be Ji\·ed many Years) their Oysters, aud Crabs, and other Shell Fish, are not so fat nrnl juiey at the Full :\loon as nt the Now, contrary to their Nature in nll other Places. Nor is it Jess admirable, that on the Coast of tho same Kingdom, near tho Mouths of the Hh·or Ind11.~, tho Sea swells, und is troubled, at the Now Moon, when not far from hence, t'i::. in tho Sea of Calic11I, the greatest Hise of Urn 'Vnters is at the Fnll. But it is requisite that we !lhould hu\'O repeated En<p1irios arnl Observations about these Matters, boforo we prote1Hl to !lolve their Phaenomenn.

1>HS Carles pretends to account. for this Phaenomcnon hy his llypotheHiR, hut I cannot apprnhend his Meaning by his 'Vords, nor how it can be deduced from it. It i~ probable, that tlw Snn and the general "'iuds may contribute much to raise these Tides, when, in tho equinoxes, the Snn is vertical to the Ocean in the middle of tlw Torrid Zo11c, and thernfore may cause both the Wiiul and Water to ra.ge, and tho former to agitate the latter. The contrary of whid1 may happen about the Solstices. Or we ma~· say, that these extraordinary Ticlns then happen by the same Hoason, and proceed from the same Cause that frequent Hains ancl Inundations proceed from in these Seasons.
THE Flux is caused by the Pressure of the )loon, or the celestial ;'\latter, between it an<l the Sen, ancl continues no longer than thn Cause forces it: \mt in the Ebh, tho Sea only flows from a higher ton lower Place, which i:i tho natural l\Iotiou of the "'ator.

The tides are generally highest in those places over which the moon is verticalBECAlJSE those Places arc more pressed, null tho swelling of tho Sen is groutnr, over which tho l\Ioon squeezeth tho celestial !\latter, whereby greater Ti<les art1 produced: but where the incumbent Matter is less squeezed, and other Causes conspirn, tho Altera! ion will be lesH. SINCE tbe l\loon, in the l\Icridian, iri 1rnarer any l'lare than when she is in the Horizon, (becanlle the Hypotenuse of any right-nnglecl Triangle is longer than tho l'eqwnclienlur) it folloW8 (by Proposition HJ, of this Chapter) thitt then it ought to be High Water in that l'lncn (whern sbe is full i:'outh). And when she is full North, or in tho lower Part of the l\lcridian Circle, it ought to bll also High "'ater in the same Place, because, tbo' she bo not there, yet the opposite Part of the Vortex of the Earth is straitued, ancl hath the same Effect, as if the Bodf of the ;'\loon it8elf were prnsont.

Then follow descriptions of tides in numerous localities, also a somewhat improved table for flnding the time of the moon's transit from the age of the moon. As nsnal, uo account is taken of the sun's effect becaneie the moon alone is :mpposed to be n·sponsiUle for the tides.
The Gyrations of tlw Sea, which we oall Vorter.c8, or Tr hirlpools, are of three lliuds. SOME Whirlpools only turn the 'Vater in a, Ronnd; others at Times absorb, untl emit or vomit it up; and some again Huck it in, but do not cllllt it out. Aud doubtless there iH a fourth Kind somowhore in the Channel of the Sea, which may throw out 'Vatcr hut takes uono in. I do not. remember nn~· llUeh to be rocortletl hy Authors; only upon the dry Land there are sevnral observed. The JJ11!cll ~InrinerH cnll these Whirlpools Jllaclstroo11i. THERE arc but very few of these, at lca8t, that lmve been taken I'\otice of. BETWEEN" Noyropo11t and Greece there is a fomouH '\'hirlpool; mile<! the l~urip11R, much tnlkecl of because of the fabulons Story of .d1'istotle's dying thcrt1. Scaligcr endcavonre to explain it t.hns. It is not much amiss (su~·s Im) to suppose the Wn.ter, received into the Caverns, in the Clitfa of tho Hocks l1elow, issuet.h from thenco; for by the continun.l running in of the Water the little rocky Bays nre lilied, and bein~ full, they emit what they roccive<I, thro' win cling nnd subterraneous Passages; whose Capacity is such, that they pour ont the Water for so many Hour,, whereby tlie Ti<les nre now obstrnoted or repelled, and a little after forwarded or helped. But any one may perceive thn insufficiency of this Cuuse. THE lllaclat1·oom on the Coust of No1·way, is the swiftest and largest known Vortex; for it is suid to be thirteen J>11t1Jh Miles in Circuit; in the middle of which there is a Rock, which the People thereabouts call the ,l!ouske. This 'Vhirlpool, for six Hours, sncks in whatever appro:iches it, or comes nigh it; not only "'nter, but "'halos, loa<lcd Shi pH, nnd other Things; aud in as many HourH disgorges them all again, with a hideous Noise, Violence, and whirling round of the Water. The Cause is latent. BETWEEN Norma11d11 in France, n.nd England, there is a Whirlpit., toward which Ships nre dmwn with nn incrocliblo Celerity; but when they come near thn middle of the Swallow, they are, with the sumo Force, thrown out again.

Is1urc Yossiu.~ (1618-168!J), in his book entitled De Motn Mari um et Yentorum, contends that the tides are produced by the heat of the sun, and that their apparent co1111ectio11 with the moon is ouly a casual sy11chro11is111.*

82. Dr .·Tohn Wallis (1616-1703). Largely in accord with Galileo's explanation of the tides in bis System of the World, is the lJypothesis of Dr. vVallis, found in Philosopllical Transactions for the year lUGG. Galileo's theory makes tl1e tides depend upon tllenon-uniforrn motion (in space) of the diffe1ent parts of the earth; that is, the places having night go eastwar1l faster than those haviug day. lVallis takes into account the fact that the earth's center does every month describe an orbit abont the common center of gravity of eartu and moon, and not about the moon itself as Baliauus assumes. 'l'his causes the places having the moon below the horizon to move faster than those having the moon above. 'l'his gives an acceleration and retardation having a period of a lunar day-a period which Galileo did not obtain. Neither writer, however, makes it clear why there should be two high waters and two low waters daily instead of one. f'l'o show that the tides cannot be caused except by the existence of attraction, we may proceed as follows: Suppose the axial rotation of the earth were zero; then (at least for a 1011g time) a given hemisphere of the earth would face a certain fixed star as the earth is carried around the center of grnYity of itself and the moon. Every particle of the earth would then have equal and parallel mot.ions and so, of course, equal centrifugal forces. Hence there could be no differential or tidal forces from this cause alone. nut given sufficient time, and some kind of mutual attraction between earth and moon which are supposed to be revolving, without axial rotation, about their wmmon center of gravity; the two bodies will eventually face each other and revolve upon their axes 011ee a month as if parts of one rigid body, anu the spherical surface of the water will then l1ave become spheroidal, chiefly, we may uow suppose, on account of the centrifugal force. nut the amount of this centrifugal deformation is obviously zero when the axial rotation is zero, aml it can become sensible only when the axial rotation becomes, or tends to become, monthly. But in the case of nature, the earth has an axial rotation whose period is constant and 110 approach to the month. Hence this centrifugal force can have no effect upon the tide.*] Ile tries to account for the spring and neap titles by the fact that when the moon is full the velocity (in space) of the earth's center about the sun is a miuimum; when new, a maximum; and when in quadrature, the Yelocity l1as its mean yalue. ln quotations given below it will be noticed how nearly Wallis comes to the solution of the prolilem of universal gravitation.t
Tho sea's ebbing an<l llowing has so great a comwxion with the moon'R motion, that iu a manner all philosophers ha\'t· attributed much of its cnuHc to tho moon, which either by some occult quality, or particular influence which it has on moist bodies, or b~· ~ome magnetic virtutl, drawing the water towards it, which Rhoul<l therefore make the water highest where the moon is vertical, or by its gr:i\'ity and pressure dow11wanls upon the terraqneons globe, which should make it lowest, whore the moon iH v.irtical, or by whatever other means, has so great au in1lnenco on, or at least con11exion with, the sea's Jinx and re1lux, that it would seem very unreasonable to separato tho consideration of tho moon's motion irom that of the son: tho periods of tidoH, to say nothing of tho greatness of them near the new and full moon, so <'Onstnntly wait.ing on tho moon's motion, that it may bo well presumed, that citlicr the 0110 is governed by tho other, or at least both by some common cause. I consider thereforo, that in the tides, or tho llnx and re1lux of the sea, besides extraordinary extravagances, or irregularities, whence great inundations or strangely high tides follow, (which yet perhaps muy prove not to he so meroly acci<lenlal as they have been thought to be, hut might from tho regular laws of motio11, if well considore<l, be hoth well ac<'ounted for, and even foretold;) these three notorious obs!.'rvations are made of the reciprocation of
tide~.

·The idea that the tides are due in 1mrt to a centrifugal disturbing force supposed to be set up becauso tho earth is carrie<I aronn<l the center of gravity of it nml the moon or sun, has appeared from timo to time since tho clays of \Vallis. E.g., Hube, "Vollstiindigcr und fasslicher l:ntcrricht in der Naturlchn·," Pt. III (Leipzig, 1794), pp. 210 et sc<J.; Aloxander \Vilcocks, "An Essay on the Tides" (Philn., 1855); P. E. Chase, .lour. Frunk. Inst., Vol. 47 (181H), pp. 137, 208; Nowcomb, Popular Astronomy (1878), p. 91. This part of the explanation does not appear in Newcomb nn<l lloldcn's Astronomy. It is, howc\·cr, still gi vcn in some text-books and popular lectures. Bornoulli, in the third urnl fourth chapters of his essay on tides, especially mentions the inability of this centrifugal force to alter the figure of the earth. In this connection, see Thomson and Tait,~ 813; also Darwin, Nature, Vol. 43 (1891), p. 609. t "Hypothesis on the Flux and Retlux of the Sen," Phil. Trans.

or a high-watt>r ancl low-water. 2. The menstrnul; wherehy in one synodical 1>eriod of the moon, suppose from full-moon to fnll-moon, tho time of thosn cliurnal ,-icissitmles moves round through the whole compass of the Nvxu'J/uFpov, or natural day of 2·1 hours; as for instance, if at the full moon the full son be nt HtJCh or snch a place j1rnt at noon, it shall he the next clay at the same place sonwwhat before ouo of the clock; the clay following, between oue an<l two; and so onwnr<I, t.ill at the uew moon it Hhall be at midnight; tho other ti<le, which in the full moon was at midnight, now at t.ho new moon coming to be at noon; and so forward, till at the n<'xt full moon tlw full Hca shall at. the same place come to boat noon again: Again, that of the spring tides and ueap 1i<lcs; nbo11t the fnll moon and new moon the tides nro nt the highest, at tho qnndruturos the tides arc a.t the lo wost; and at the times intcrmodinto, proportiouahly. 3. Tho aunnal, * whereby it is obsorveu, that at some part of the ~·ear, the spring tides are yet much higher than tho spring tides at others, which times aro 11s11ally taken to be at tho spring and autumn or tho two equinoxes; but I ha\'Cl reason to believe, as well from my own obsen·atious for many years, as of oth.,rs who have alike observed it, that wo should rather assign the beginnings of Februar~· and NovemlH:r, than tho two equinoxes.

Jn his explanation, as already intimated, he attributes the thlcs to the rotation of the earth upon its axis, the revolution of moon and earth about their common ee11tcr of gravity, and the revolution of this common center about the sun,-gravity serving- merely as a tie to connect the bodies, their motions causing the tides. From this quotation it is seen that the semi-annual variation in the phase inequality (in height) was known to \Vallis although he was for some years mistaken in thinking the times of its maxima could fall far from the equinoxes.+ Ile attempts to explain this uo11-coincide11ce with the equinoxes by the inequality in the length of the solar day, or rather by the cause of the incqnality In further discussion of the sub,icct, lie <listinctly suggests an annual variation in the phase inequality (in height) <lne to the sun beiug in apogee or perigce.:j: To clear up these questions he very properly tmggests the observing of low waters as well as of high, and the selecting- of stations near the opeu sea.§ 'l'o retul'll to the question of gravitation. Jn reply to an objection to this portion of his theory, he says: II
To the first objection of those you mention, That it appears not how two bodies that have no tie Cll\I have one co111111011 "entro of gravity; that is, for so I umlerstancl the int.en<lment. of tho objection, cau net or be ncted int.he sumo 111an11er as if they were cmmectetl: I shall 011ly 1rnHwer, that it. is harcler to show how the~' have tha11 that tlwy have it. That t.he loadstone and iron h1l\'o somewhat eqnivnlent to a tie, t.hongh we see it not, ~-et by the effel'ts we know. And it wonl<l bo easy to show that two loadstones at once applie<l iu different positions to the same uce<lle, at sonlll eouvenient <liHt.ance, will drnw it, not t.o poi11t directly to either of them, but to some point between hoth; which point. is, us to those two, tlrn common centre of attral'.tiou; anu it is the same as if some one loadstone Wl'ro in thnt point. Yet han1 these two loadstonm1 no connection or th,, though a common <'eutro of virt1w, n<'cording to whieh they joiutly net. An<l :1s to the present case, how tho earth nncl 1110011 are eounected, I will uot uow undertake to sllow, nor is it necessnry to my pnrpo!<e; hnt that there is Romewhat. that cloes connect them, as rnnch as what collll<'Cls the loadstone ancl the iron which it clrnws, is past clonbt to those w!.io allow them to \10 carried abont by the Hnu, as oue aggregate or 1.Jocly, whose parts keep a resp<ic.tive posit.ion to one a11other: Likens .Jupiter with his four satellites, a11d Sat.nm with his one.

This is a close approach to Newton's discovery, but the law of the snppo~e1l attract.ion is not Rtated. Halley, however, in lti84 coucluded that the centripetal force in planetary orbits must be inrnrsl'ly as the Rquare of the distance.,) Kepler had asserted, in HiO!), that the force is proportional to the masses. Newton discovered an1l established the law of universal gravitation in Hi82, but the details of its extension to physical and astronomical questions extended over a few succeeding years,-until the 1mblication of the Principia in 1687.

Later replies by Wallis are found in the TranRaction:'I for 1668 and 1670. 83. Sir Robert Moray*' ( -167~). Moray doubt~ the supposition that the increaRe of tides from neaps to spring exactly followR the law of sines. He points out that the irregularities in the time required by the moon in goiug from new to full, or vice i 1ersa, will preclude any exact law in the matter. He proposes what was probably the first box gauge; i.e., a gauge with a tloat.t Among other things, be recommends observing the height of the tide and the v<'locity of the current every 15 minutes; the exact heights of high an1l low water; the direction and velocity of the wind; the state of the weather, including barometric readings. He would have the series continued for some months, or rather, years. Samuel Colcpresse. From observations made at and near Plymouth in 1667, Colepresse arrives at the following conclusions: :t
Tho diurnal tides, from about tho latter end of March till the latter end of Septmnhor, aro about a foot higher in the ovening than in tho morning, that is, in eYery tide that happens aftor noon and before midnight. On tho contrary, tho morning tides, from l\liclmolmas till Lady-day in March again, are constantly higher by about a foot than those that happen in tho evening. Ancl th ill p1 oportion holds in both, in the intcrmeuiato times of incrcnso arnl tlocronso. Tho highest monihly llpring tide is always tho thircl tidn after the new or fnll 1110011, if a cross wind do not oppo!!o tho water, al! tho north-east or north-west UHnally does. Tho highest spring!! make the lowest ebbs. Tho water neither flows nor ebbs alike in respect of equal degr<'e8; but its velocity inereases with the ticle, till jut1t at mid-water or half Hood, at which time the velocity Is strongest, and HO decreases pro11ortionahly till high water or full sea. As appears by tho following scheruo, collected from ohservntioull made at several times a111l places; which, though taken at Plymouth Haven, where even the water usually risen about llixteen feet, yet it may indifforently serve for other placos, where it may rise as many fathoms, or uot so high, by a proportional ad<litiou or lluhtraction.

It will be Sl'en that Colepresse was familiar with the diurnal inequality in the height of high water and knew that if for one half of the year higher high water fall in the evening, say, for the other half it would fall in the morning.

use the letters ~ to mark such lunitidal intervals as give a higlier high or lower low

Henry Philips§ draws a circle whose circumference is divided into 12 equal parts representing the 12 hours of transit of the moon. TLe diameter upo11 which these points are projected has written upon it the values of the interval which correspond to the several hours of transit.

divisions upon it represent equal times.· He is wrong in assuming that the longest interval corresponds to the zero or twelfth hour of transit and the shortest to the sixth. This was pointed out by Flamsteed, the first astronomer royal, about 15 years later. Ile says that Philips ''was certainly the first that brouy;ht the inequality to a rule." t Philips says that by changiug the values written upon the diameter, the same construction is applicable elsewhere. Capt. Samuel Sturmy. From the extract given below describing the tides in Hong· Road, near Bri::>tol, it will be seen that Sturmy as well as Colepresse was familiar with the phenomenon of high·water diurual inequality, and knew that if for one half of the year the higher high water fall in the evening, say, for the other half, it would fall in the morning; he knew, moreover, that this inequality is independent of the springs a11d neaps. t
Concerning our diurnal tides, we observe, that from about the latter end of March till the latter end of September, they are nbont t foot 3 inches higher in the evening than in the morning; that is, when high water happens after the sun is past the meridian, or in the tides between noon and midnight: But from lllichnelmas till Lady-day we find the contrary, the day tides beiug in that season higher by 15 iuches than the night tides, or the tides between ruiduight and noon. Aml thi8 proportion bolus in both, after the gradual increl18e of the tides from neap to the higlw~t. spring, and the like decrease of their lleight till neap agaiu. As for the highest menstrual spring-tide, it is alwayH the tllird after the full moon or change-day, if it be not kept back by north-east wintls.

Stnrmy gives n taule, similar to that given by Colepresse, showing the rise and fall in Hong. Road, near Bri::>tol. He then describes tlie ''boar" in the Severn.
Iu the Severn, 20 mileR above Bristol, neur ::\'cwnham, 160 mileH from the river's month (Lund~·,) tho head of the flood, in spring-tides rises in height liken wall near nine feet high, and AO runs for many miles together, coveriug ut onc<1 all the Hhoals which were dry before; nt which time ,uJl vesHClls that lie in the way of these head tides, or bonrH, as tlley are popularly called, uro commonly overset, or carried upon the banks; and the head of the tide being past, such vessc!H nre left dry again. It 11ows there but 2 hours and 18 feet in height, and it ebbs ten hours. The reason of tile saitl boar is don btless the straightening and Bhoaliug of tile ri\·er in that place, it being there but half a mile broatl; as it is but 20 perches over three miles higher, running tapering to Gloucester.

84. Joseph Childrey. Childrey does not agree with Wallis in the mistaken notion that the highest tides happen about Allhallowtide and Candlemas. He says that English seamen, as a rule, believe them to occur uear the equinoxes. He thinks that Wallis's November high tides must have l>een due to freshets. After giving numerous instances of remarkably high tides when the moon was in perigee, from the year 1250 to 1G69, he says:§
Further, whnt inclines me to believe that the perigmosis of tho moon is of some concernment in this matter, is, because it is a maxim among our KentiRh scumen, thnt thBy never l1ave two running spring tides (as they call tht>m) together, but that tho next spring tide, after a higll running spring, is proportionnbly weak and slack; which, if true, is very correspondent to my opinion, because, if the moon be in Jlerig11'0 at this spring tide, she will be in npog:~o ut the next. But I conceive the best touchstone to prove the<Sounduess of my opinion is, to have it observed, whether those 11eap-tides be not nppnrently higher that llappen at the moon's being in porigreo either at tile first or last quarter: because it is a recei\·ed and demonstrable truth in nstronolll~', that the moon being in perigmo at either quarter, comes then nearer the ea,rth tllun when it is iu pt"rigreo at the change or full.

Assuming the tides to be due to the rotary motions of earth and moon (i.e., Wallis's theory), Ohildrey evidently believes that the parallax inequality occurs wit.h the ueap tides as well as with the spring; and, moreover, that such inequality is affected by the moon's phase. This virtually infers au inequality in the parallax effect, whose period is the synodic period of the anomalistic month and the half synodical month, or about one· half of 41~ days; this is the inequality due to the evectiou. Its effect, however, is quite the reverse of what be surmises it to be,1J owing to the wrong astronomical notion which he entertains, and which was generally received before it was supplanted by the hypothesis of Horrox.~] That is, the parallax inequality in height is really increai,;ed in the syzygies and diminished in the quadratures. 0

UNl'l'ED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SUHVEY.

John Flamstecd (1646-1719). Flamsteed published (in the Philosophical Transact.ions) a tide table giving the times of high water at London Bridge for the year 1G83, and cont.inued its publication for several succeeding years. He corrects Mr. Phillips\; table from observatious which he caused to be made. In his descriptiou of the 1G1:i3 table he says:"
Hitherto our tide-tables h:we onl.r showed the tillln of that one high-water which next follows the moon's southing; but in this new ta hie I ha Ye given the times of both . . · . This table may be re<lnced an1! made to scn·e for any other port of his majesty's dominions urn] ndghbouring countries, by only subtracting or a1lding so much time to the bigh·watcrs noted in it, as the high-water observed in the sai1l place shall be found to precede or follow tlrn time of the bigh-water the sanw day. For b~· 1rnch accounts as I have met wit.11 alHl receh·cd of the ti1lcs in rellloto places, I li111l there is eY<'ry where, about England, the same difference between the spring arnl neap-tides, that is here observed in tho rh·or Thames. I could easily hav" made and gh·en you a talJle for tl1is reduction, if I Jure ha,·e rcliell on tho account our mariners give of tho tidPs in other ports; but I find tlll'ir ;,pinions different, except whore they have copied from each other in their calernlan1; by reason of the af'oro-meut.ione1l difference between the times of the moon's sou things and the true high-waters; for which reason I forbear it, till further experience shall hll\'O informed ns better.

About a year later Flamsteed pnblishe<l a table of tidal differe11ces to be applied to the London tides. t Thi:; is probably the earliest known table of tid<~l differences. 80. Dr. Rrlmuud Halley (1657-1742). Halll'y uotes the connection of the 1110011':-i decli11atio11 aud the titles at '1'011qui11, which Francis Da\'euport's ohservatio11s hall shown to be diurnal in their character. Bnt the law which he proposes for ascertaining the height of high or low water for various longitudes of the moon, is obviously iuconect. He says: :j:
The effect of the moon on the waters in tlw production of the tides in the port of Tonqnin is the more surprising, as it seems different in all its eircumst.ancn8 from the ge1wral rule, whereby the motion of the sea iH regulated in all other parts of tho world that I h:t\'e yet heard of. For first, each flux iB of about 12 hours 1l11ration, and its correspondent reflux as long; so that there is hut one high water in 2-1 hours. Then there arn in each month two intermiseious of the tilles, nbont 14 da~·s asunder, when thern is no sensible llooll or rising of the waters to he ohserve<l, but the dea is in a manner staguant. Thir1ll~" that the increase of the water haH its U days perio1l between the aforesaid intermissions; and at 7 <lays crnl makes the highest tides; from which time the water again gra1l11ally abattts, and the flood is wenker till it comes to a stagnation, both increase and <lccrense observing tbe same rnle in being exceedingly slow in their beginning nnd end, and swift in the middle. Lastly, and which is most strange, the rising moon in the one half of each month makes high wnter, and the setting moon in the otlwr half. These pnrticnlars considered, together with the tables showing the days of the water's stagnation in each month, gave me a light into the secret of this strange appearance, so as to be able t.o bring the hitherto unaccountable irregularity of these tides to a certain rule. And first it appenrs that the intermiHsions of the tides happen nearly on those <lays that the moon enters the signs of Aries arnl Libra, or pnsses the equinoctinl, which tlivides the moon's course nearly into two e11ual parts, as well as the sun's; and from lrnnce it follows, tlrnt the tropical moons in§ and 't.l, are those which occasion the greatest flux arnl rellux.~ It also appears thnt the moon in northern signs brings in tho 11oo<l, whilst !!he is abovo tho horizon, so as to make high water at her setting, and on the contrary, that whilst she is in southern signs, it flows all tho timo t!:o 1110011 i8 below the horizon, and so makes high water at her rising. llnt it is to be obse~\·ed, that though tho moon paMs swiftly from south to north when she is in or near ')", and from north to south when in or near~, yet the 111otio11 of the sea, which is the cause of this tido, is scarcely dis~ernihle for 3 or 4 days, when the moon passes tho sai1l eqniuoctial poiuts; whence it appears, that though the declination of the 1110011 he that whereb~· these tides nro re;;nlated, yet the increase and decrease of the water is by no rne:ins proportionate to that of her declination, that changing swiftly, whero tho increase of the water is obscrrn1l to be most slow. It seems therefore, and 1 propose it as a probable conjecture, that the incrense of the waterH should be always proportionate to the vcrso1l sines of the doubled distances of the moon from the equinoctial points.

In the same discussion he suggests the existence of an inequality in the ''spring range" (i.e., gl'eat tropie range) dependent upon the obliquity of the lunar orbit to the plane of the earth's equator.II He says:
There is yet. another thing well worth inquiry, viz. seeing that this motion of the sea is more or less, as the moon is farther from or nearer to tho equinoctial, it is not unlikely that some years may have nmch higher spring tides ·"A correct Tide Table, showing the true Times of tho High-waters at London Bridge, t.o every Day in the Year

In the year 16ll7 Halley calls attention to the excellence of Newton's Principia in explaining the cause and phenomena of the tides.· He notes that the moon's disturbing force would cause the spherical surface of the ocean to become spheroidal; that sun and moon have similar effects; that spring tides correspond to new and full moon, and 11eap tides to the quarters; that equinoctial spring tides are, ca:tcri.~ paribus, the highe8t, but that the nearness of the sun in the wii1ter displaces them somewhat, making them in February and October; that there should generally be a diurual inequality; that tidal inequalities should have an age; and that even diumal tides, like those at 'roll(1uin, may be accounted for. SG. The preceding pages show the diversity of views concerning the cause of titles and tidal currents entertained before the law of gravitation was established. Among those described or alluded to are: The discharging of rivers into the sea (Tim:eus); winds, set up by the sun or moon, striking the water (Aristotle, Heraclides, Seleucus); ho1lily oscillations of large bodies of water within the earth (Plato); the surface of the sea being on a slope (Eratosthenes); vapors surrounding the moon (Strabo); submarine caverns; the breathing of au earth auimal (Apollonius); water increasing with the waxing 1110011 (Pliny); sympa.thy whereby the moon attracts moist bodies; rarefaction of the water caused by the moon or sun; occult qualities of the moon; westward diur11al motion of the primmn mobile; the vortex theory (Descartes); a whirlpool off the coast of Norway; the absolute motion of a fixed point 011 the earth's surface uot being uniform at all times, thereby setting up a variable ce11trifugal force (Galileo, Wallis); and the heat of the suu. Some of the other 11otio11s which have been advanced to explain the phenomenon of the title are: U ncqual depths causing diverse densities in the water; submarine heat, fermentations, UIHl vapors; a libratio11 of the earth; and the force of rays of light from the sun and moon. l\fore particulars alo11g this line are given by H.iccioli, Lalande, Peschel, Huge, aud Uiinther.

NEWTON TO LAPLACE.

Rir Isaac Newton (1642-1727). 87. Before referring to Newton's work upon tides it may be well to state some of the consequences of the law of gravitation when applied to certain astronomical questions which have a direct bearing upon the subject. In Propoi:1ition LXVI, Book I, of the Principia, the disturbing force of a third body is considered. Applying his results to the case of the moon as disturbed by the sun we obtain the following: ' The moon's motion is by the action of the sun retarded while in the first and third quadrants, but accelerated while in the second and fourth (Cor. 2). Ga:terfa paribus, the moon moves more swiftly in the syzygies than in the quadratures (Cor. 3). Occteris paribus, the moon is nearer to the earth in the syzygies tllan in the quadratures (Cor. 5). The line of apsides advances in the long run although its motion is at times retrograde. It advances most rapidly when the line of apsides is in syzygy and most slowly when in quadrature (Cor. :1, 7). The eccentricity of the moon's orbit will be the greatest when the apsides are in the syzygies, and least when in the quadratures (Cor. !J). The nodes being either stationary or having a retrograde motion, will for any revolution of the moon be carried backwardl'I (Cor. 11 ). The disturbing force of the sun is a little greater at conjunct.ion than at opposition (Cor. 12). The disturbing force of the sun is, very nearly, inversely as the cube of its dhitance trom the earth's center (Cor. 14). The action of the sun upon the redundant matter in the equatorial regions of the earth will cause the equinoxes to be carried back\vards (Cor. 20). In Proposition LXXI, Book I, it is shown that the attraction of a spherical shell upon an external poi11t is the same as if all matter of the shell were collected at its center. From the construction given in Proposition XXV, Book III, it follows (considering the great distance of the ~mn) that at the quadratures the disturbing force of the sun upon tile moon js directed towards the earth, but at the syzygies the disturbiug force is twice as great and is directed from the earth. In Proposition XX VIII, Book III, it is found that the moon's distance from the earth in the syzygies is to its distance iu the quadratures (setting aside the consideration of the eccentricity) as u!.l to 70, very nearly. In Proposition XXXII, Book III, the mean motion of the lunar nodes is 19° 18' 1" 23"' per sidereal year; ancl in Proposition XXXIX the precession of the equinoxes due to both moon and sun is very nearly 50". Newton regards the tide in three different ways: First. Book I, Prop. LXVI, Cors. 18, rn, a kinetic theory or hypothesis. The motion of a particle of water re.volving with the earth about a fixed axis is disturbed by an extraneous body, just as the moon revolvlr1g- about the earth is disturbed by the sun causing the inequality of variation. This necessitates low water a11d maximum eastward velocity :with respect to the fixed surface of the earth) at the time of upper or lower transit; also high water arul maximum westward velocity at moonrise or moonset. For, supposing an analogy to the moon's \'ariation, the particle becomes a little nearer to the earth's center, and moves a little more rapidly (in space) as the body nears meridian. He makes no attempt to apply this theory to observed tides.·
"Prof. J. Cballis, in "A mathematical theory of tides," Phil. :\lag., Vol. 3!J (1870), pp. 31, 32, <loe8 not belie,·e that thiB hypothe8is of Newton's necessitates low water at the tinrn8 of transitB, hnt rather high water. Challis erroneously assumes that the time of the title <lependB upon the vertical forces msteud of the horizoutul. Cf.~ 41. 410

Second. Cor. 20. His next hypothesis is that (disregarding friction, etc.) high water occurs wl1e11 the disturbing vertical force is zero, instead of when its value becomes a maximum, as in the uncorrected equilibrium theory. This occurs about three hours before or after the transit of the tidal body. He assumes that friction may retard the times of the tides somewhat and that "the motion of ascent or descent impressed by these (astronomical) forces may by the vis insita of the water continue a little longer or be st.opped a little sooner by impediments in its channel." 'Third. Book Ill, Prop. XXXVI, an equilibrium theory or hypothesis, in which the density of the earth is that of water. 88. In Propositio11 XXlV, Book III, Newton treats of the principal phenomena pertaining to tides. He says:
"By Cors. l!J and 20, Prop. LXVI, Book I, it appears that the waters o.f the sea onght twice to riso und twice to fall twcry da~-, as well lunar as solar; and that the greatest height of tho wut.ers in the open and deep nous onght to follow tlw appnlse of the luminaries to the meridian of tho place by a lcst1 interval thnn 6 hours; as happens in nil that. en8tem tract of the Atlantic und ..Etlliopic ~eus between Fra11ce and the Capt! of Good Hope; and on the coasts of Chili and l'cru in the South Sea;" in all which shores tlrn flood fulls out about the second, third, or fourth hour, unless where the motion propagated from the deep ocean is by the shallowness of the channels, through which it pusses to some particular places, retarded to the fifth, sixth, or Hoven th hour, and even later. The hours I reckon from tho uppulse of each luminary to the moridiun of the place, as well under as abovo the horizon; ant! uy the hours of tbe lunar day I understmul the 24th prirts of that time which the moon, by its ripparent diurnal motion, eruployH to come o.hout again to tho meridian of the place which it left tho duy beforo. The force of the sun or moon in raising the sea is greatest in tho appnlse of the luminary to the meridian of the pince; but the force improsscd upon the sea at that time continues a little while after the impression, and is afterwards increased by 11 new though less force still actiug upon it. This makes the son rise higher and higher, till this new for<·e becoming too weak to misc it all,\' more, the sea rises to its grl'atest height. And this will come to pnss, perhaps, in one or two hours, but more frequently near the shores in about three hour1>, or even more, where tbe sea is slrnllow. Tho two luminaries excite two 111otions, which will not nppetir distinctly, but botweon them will arise one mixed motion compounded ont of both. In the conjnnction or opposition of the lnmitHtries their forces will he conjoined, an<l bring on tlw grnntest floo<l ulHl obb. In the quadratures the sun will raise the waters which th(l rnoon depresses, und depress the waters which the moon raises, and from the difforenco of their forces the smallest of nil tides will follow. And because (as experience tells us) the force of the moon is greater than that of the sun, tho g1·eatcst height of tho waters will happen about tho th ir<l lunar hour. Out of tho s~·zygics an<l qu1ulrntures, the greatest tide, which hy the single force of tho moon ought to fall out at the thir<l lunar hour, uncl by the single force of tbe sun at the third solar hour, by the compounde<l forces of both mnst full out in nu inkrmcdiato timo that approaches nearer to tho third hour of the moon than to that of the 111111. And, therefore, while the moon is passing from the syzygies to the <pllldratnrrs, during which time the 3<1 hour of th<i 81111 precedes thti 3'1 hour of the moon, the greatest height of tile waters will nlso prcce<lo tho 3<1 hour of tho moon, and tbat, by the greatest intervnl, n little after the octnnts of tho moon; and, by like inten·uls, tho great.est tide will follow the 3d lunar honr, while the moon is passing from tlrn qnadratnres to tlw syzygies. Thus it happens iu tho open sea; for in tho mouths of rivers the greater tides come later to their height, Bnt the effects of the luminaries depend upon their distnuc~s from the earth; for when they are less distant, their effects are groator, aml wl1en more distant, their effects are loss, aml ,thnt in the triplicate proportion of their apparl·nt diameter. Therefore it is that tho sun, in the winter tim<', being then in its peri~ee, has I\ greater effect, an<l wnkcs tho tides in the syzygies something greater, and those in the qundraturcs something less than in tho summer seuson; un<l every month the moon, while in the perigee, raises greater tides than at the distance of 15 days before or after, when it is in its apogee. Whence it comes to pass that two highest tides do not follow one the other in two immediately succeeding syz~·gies. The dfect of either luminai·y doth likewise depend upvn its declination or distance from the equator; for if the luminary was plu<'e<l at the }!Ole, it wonlcl constantly attract all the parts of the waters without any intension or n·mission of its action, and conl<l cause no reciprocation of motion. And, therefore, ns tbe lurninnries <lechno from the e<1uator toward either pole, they will, by degrees, Jose their force, and on this account will excite lesser tides in tho solstitial than iu the equinoctial syzygies. Hnt in tho solstitial quadratures they will raise greater ti<lcs than in tho quadratures abont the nqnmoxes; bocuuse the force of tho moon, then situated in the equator, most exceeds tho force of the snn. Therefore the great!lst tides full ont in thoso syzygies, and the least in those qnudratnres, which lmppcn abont the times of both equinoxes: and tho greatest tide in the syzygies is always succc0<led by the Ion.et ttdo in the qun~lruturcs, as we fin<l b~· experience. llut, because the sun is less distant from tho earth in winter than in summer, it comes to pass that the greatest nn<l !oust tidos more frequently appear before than after the vornnl equinox, un<l more frll<JIHmt.Jy ufter than before the autumnal. Moreover, tho effects of t.he 111minurim1 dcpon<l upon the lntitudoil of places. t ·To ascertain the amount of trnth in thesn stat<·ments, conRnlt a cotidnl chart.

He then assumes, without proof, that the Rnrface of the sea takes the form of a spheroid whose axis points at the position of the moo11 three hours before the given time. He shows that the greater high water should follow au npper nort,~ transit for places in north latitude, :111d · a 1ower soutu vice vcrsn for places in south latitude. This, in a general way, explains the diurnal inecpiality. ne adds:
An<l the greatest 1liffcr1mce of the floo<ls will fall out about the times of the Holstices; especially if the ascen<ling no<le of the moon is about the first of AriQ.~. So it is fonn<l by expcricnc<l that the rnorni11g titles in winter exceed those of the evening, and the ovening tides in snmnwr excce<l thos<1 of the 111orning; at Plymouth by the height of one foot, but at Bristol by the height of 15 inches, according to the observations of ColepreBB antl Stunuy.

ThiR explains in a satisfactory manner the annual and nodal variation in the diurnal i11equality."' Co11tinui11g, Newton gives an explanation of the smallness of the diurnal inequality which seems to have passe<l 1111<1uestio11ed u11til the subject was investigate<] by Laplar.e: t
Bnt the motions which we hav1i been <11·scribing si:fl'cr some alteration from that force of reciprocation, which the waters, being once moved, retain a little while by their 1.'iH illxila. \Vhence it comes to pas~ that the tides mny continue for sonw time, thongh the actions of the luminaries shonl<l cease. This power of retaining the improt;se<l motion lesAeut1 the <lifference of tho altt1rnate tides, a11tl makes those tides which immetliatd~- Huccced after the syzygies greater, and those which follow next after the qua<lratures less. An1l hence it is that tht· alternate ticles at Plymouth and Jl1·i8tol do not differ much more one from the other than by the height of n foot or 15 inches. :uul that the ~re:itest tides of all at those ports are not the first but thP third after the syzygi<'B. Antl, besides, all the motions are retar<le<l in their passage through t1hallow channels, so that the grenteAt tides of all, in Home straits and mouths of rivers, are the fourth or even the fifth after the syzygiPs. Farther, it may happen that the tide may be propagate<l from the ocean through different channels towards the same port, and may pass c1uicker throngh eome channels than through others; in which case the Hauw title, divided into two or more succeeding one another, may compound new motions of different kinds. Let u~ suppose two equal tides flowing towards tl1<1 same port from ditfernnt placeR, the one preceding the other by six honrs; and suppose the J;rst tide to happen at the third hour of the appnlso of Urn moon to the meridian of the port. If the moon at the time of tho uppulse to the meri<lian was in the equator, every six hours nlt.crnat"1y there woulcl nriso equal floods, which, meeting with as many equal ebbs, woulcl so balance oue the other, that for that day, the water would staguate antl remain quiet. If the 1110011 then tleclinetl from the equator, tho titles in the ocean would be alternately greater and less, as was sai<l; and from thence two greater and two lesser tides wonl<l be alternately propagated towards that port. But the two greater f1001ls would make the greateAt height of tho waters to fall out in the middle time betwixt both; and tho greater and lesser floods would make the waters to rise to a mean height in the mi<ldle time between them, uud in tho mitl<lle time between the two lesser floods the waters wonl1l rise to their least height. Thus in the space of 2-1 hours the waters would conw, not twice, ns commonly, but once only to their greatest, and once only to tlwir least height; and their greatest height, if the moou <lecliued toward the elevate<! pole, wouhl happen nt the Gth or 30th hour after tho appulse of the moon to the meri<lian; an<l when the moon chnuged its <leclination, this flood would be changed into an ebb. An exumple of all which Dr. Halley has ~iven ns, from the obscrvntious of seamen in the port of JJaiBltam, in tho king<lom of Tu11q11i11, in the lntitnde of 20" 50' north. In that port, on the day which follows after the passage of the moon over the eqnntor, the waters stagnate: when the moon declines to the uorth, they begin to flow und ebb, not twice, as in other ports, but once ouly every tlny: 1111d the 110011 happens at the setting, nn1l the greatest ebb nt the rising of the moon. This tide increuses with the declination of the moon till the 7th or 8th day; then for the 7 or 8 days following it decreases at tlrn same rate ns it bad increased before, and ceases when the J110011 changes its dechnatiou, crosHing over the equator to the south. After which the flood is immediately changed into an ebb; nml thenceforth tho ebb happens nt the setting and thn flood at the rising of the moon; till the moou, again pnesing the c111rntor, changes its declination. There nre two inlets to this port aml the neighboring channels, one from the sens of Clti11a, between the cont.inent and the island of Le11co11ia; the other from the.£111/ian se1i, between the contineut nod the island of Borneo. But whether there be really two tides propagate<l through the sai<l channels, one from the Indian sen in the space of 12 hours, and one from the s1·n of Cltina in the space of 6 hours, which therefore happening at the 3d and 9th lunar hours, b)· being compounded together, produce those motious; or whether there be nny other circnmstnnces in the stnt<1 of those seas, I leave to be <letermiuetl b)· observations on the neighbouring shores. Thus I have explained the causes of the motiona of the moon nud of the sea. Now it is fit to subjoin Aomething concerning the quantity of those motions.

In the next proposition,:j: it is shown that the disturbing· force of the sun upon the moon at quadrature is the 1/6380!l!Nl part of the force of gravity at the earth's s11rface, this Leiug· one half its value at syzygy.

SD. Proposition XXXVI, Book III, resumes the question of the tides, and begins by passing from the snn's disturbing force upon the moon to the force tending to move the sea. 'l'his is the first attempt at a quantitive dete1·mination of tlrn tidal forces and constitutes an important laudmark in the development of the subject. He uses the sun rather than tho moon becau~e the ratio of the 11rnss of the moon to that of the earth was then an unknown qnaut~ty.
But, desce111li11g to the surfa<"e of the earth, these forces are diminished in proportion of thll distan1·cs fro111 the <"entro of thl' earth, that is, in the proportion of 60! to 1; n111l therefore tl10 former force on tho earth's surface is to tho force of gravity nH 1to38 60-1600;~ nnd hy this force the sen is depressed in sueh places as arc !JO degrel's distant from t.hc sun. But by the other force, which is twice as great, the sen is misecl not only in ·the plal'es directly under tlie sun, but in those also which are directly opposed to it;! and the sum of these forces is to the force of gradt~· as 1to12 868 :WO.! And because the same force excites the same motion, whether it depresses the waters iu thostl places which are 90 llegrees distant from the sun, or raises them in the places which aro directly u111ler and directly opposed to Urn snn, the aforesaid snm will bo the total force of the Run to disturb the sea, antl will have tho Baille effed mi if tho whole was omplo~·ed in raising tho sea in the places directly under and directly opposed to the sun, an(l tlill uot act nt all in tlrn 11laces which are !lO degrees removed from the sun.~ And this is the foroo of the Hun to disturb tho sea in any gh·en place, "·hero the sun is at tho same timo both vertical, arnl in its mean distance from tl.10 earth. In other positions of the s1m, its force to raise tho sea is as tho versed sine of double its altitude above tho horizon of tho place directly, II and the cube of the distance from the earth reciprocally. Cor. Since the l'entrifngal force of tho parts of the earth, arising from the earth's diurnal motion, which is to the force of graYity as 1 to 28!l, raises tho waters under the c11uator to 11 height exceeding that nuder tho iioles by 85 472 l'aris feet,~ as above, in Prop. XIX, tho force of the sun, which we have now shewed to be to the force of grnYity as 1 to 12 868 200, 11111! tl1<·rcfore is to that cPutrifugal force as 289 to 12 868 200, or as 1 to 44 527, will be able to rnise the waters in tho placl'S dirnctly under au1l directly opposed to the sun to a height exceediug that in the places which arc 90 degrees n·moved from the snn only by one l'm·is foot aml lllu inches; for this measure is to the measure of g;; ·1i2 feet as 1 to 4·1 f>27.

'l'he next proposition, entitled "To find the fon·e of the moon to move the sea," and in which further quantiti,·e results are obtained, is as follows:
Tlw force of tlrn moon to move the sea is to be deduced from its llrOportion to the force of the sun, :tll(l this pro port ion i1:1 to be collcctotl from tho proportion of the motions of the son, whid.1 are the effects of thoso forces. Before tho mouth of tho river Al'011, throe miles below JJriBlol, the height of the ascent of the water in the vernal and antunmal s~·zygies of the luminaries (by the observations of Sa.ni1wl St11rm.y) amounts to about 45 foet, but in the quadratures to 25 only. The former of thoso heights arises from tho ~11111 of the nforesuhl forces, the Jatfor from their difference. If, therefore, S and L are Hupposed to represent respectively the forces of the sun nnd moon while they are in tho equator, as well as in their mean distances from the earth, wo shall h1n·e L + S ti) L-S as ·15 to 25, or us !J to 5. At l'ly111011th (by tho observations of Samuel ColcJ11'CBB) tho tide in its menu height rises to about 16 feet, nnd in tl1e spring and autumn the height thereof in the syzygies may exceed that in the quadratures by more than 7 or 8 feet.. Suppose tho greatest differenoo of those heights to ho !l foot, aud L S will be to L-S as 20~ to 11~, or ns 41 to 23; a propoi-tiou that agrees well enough with the former. Bnt because of tho great title at llrislol, we nre rather to depeutl upon the observations of St11r111y; and, therefore, till we Jlfocure someth!.ng that is more certain, we shall use tho proportion o( !l to 5. But bee1iuso of the reciprocal motions of the wators, the greatest tides do not 1111.ppen nt tho times of the syzygies of tho luminnrios, but, us we have suitl before, are tho third in order after the syzygies; or (reckoning from tho syzygies) follow next after tho third nppulso of the moon to the mericlinu of the placn after tho syzygies; or, rather (us Sl11rmy obsen·es) are the third after tho day of the new or full moon, or ruther nearly after the twelfth hour from the new or full moon, antl therefore fall nearly upon the forty-third hour after tho new or fnll of the moon. But in this port they fall on t about tho seventh hour after tho appulse of tho moon to tho meridian of tho place; nncl therefore follow next after tho appulse of the moon to tho meridian, when the moon is distant from tho sun, or from opposition with the sun by about 18 or l!l degrees in co11scq11e11fia. So the summer and winter seasons come not to their height in the solstices themselves, bnt wlwn the sun is udvauced beyond the solstiem· by about a tenth part of its whole oourse, that is, by about 36 or 37 1legroos. In like mauner, the greatest tide is raised after the nppulse of tho llloon to the meridian of the place, when tlrn moon has passed by the sun, 01· t!tc opposilio11 tltereof, by about tho tenth part of tho whole motion from one f/1·c11tcBt ticle to lite next followi11!J yreatcBt tide. Suppose that distance about 18~ degrees; and tho sun's force in this clistanoo of the moon from tho Hyzygies mul qundru.t.ures will be of loss moment to augment and diminish that part of the motion of tho s"a which proc<'mls from the mot.ion oft.ho moon than in tho

Whernforn sin<·o the force of tho snn is to tho force of gravity as 1 to 12 868 200,. tho muo11's forcn will be to the force of gravity as 1 to 2 871 ·IOO. Cor. 1. Sincn tho waters excited by the imn's force rise to tho height of a foot an<l 11·.,\r inehcs, tho JU'Jon's for1·c will raiHe the s11111c to tho hei1d1t of 8 foet anti 7J·~ inches; and the joiut forces of both will raise the same to the licight of 101 feet; and when the moon is in its perigee to the lieight of 12t foot, and more, especially when tho wind sds the same wn.v as the tide. And a force of that quantity is alrnuclnntly sufiicient to excite all the mot.ions of the sea, and agrees well with the proportion of thos<i ruotious; for in such sea~ aA lie free nud open from east to west, as iu the /'ac(!ic Aea, and iu those tracts of the Atlantic and Ethiopic sea8 which lie withont tho tropics, tho waters commouly rise to G, 9, 12, or 15 feet; but in t.110 !'aciji1: sea, which iA of a greater depth, as well as of a larger extent, the tides are said to he greater th11n in the Atlrrntic und Eti1io)liC ;;cas; for to have a full tide raised, an oxt<'nt of sea from east to west is required of no l~ss than 90 degrees. In the Et/1iopic sea, the waters ri8c to a less height within the tropics t ban in the tempera to zones, hccanse of the narrowne8H of the sea he tween .·lfrica anti the southern parts of Amm·ica. ln the middle of the open sea the waters oannot riHe without fulling together, aud ut tho same time, upon both tho eastern and western shores, when, notwithstanding, in our narrow seas, they ought to foll on those Hhoros by alternate turns; upon whil'h account thoro is commonly but a small flood and ebb in such islands as lie for distant from the continent. On the contrary, in some ports, where to fill ancl empty the bay8 n.lternntolr the waters are with great violcnee forced iu and ont through shallow chan1JclH, the Hood and ebb nm~t be greater than ordinary; as at Plymouth uncl ChepBlow B1·idge in England, at tho 1110111Jt11ins of St. Michael, and the town of .111ra11clics, in Non11and!t, nnd nt Cambaia ancl Pe,q1i in the EaBt Indies. In tllcso }>laces tho sea is hurried in and out with snch violence, as sum<·timcs to lay the shores under wn.ter, sometimes to lea\'c them dry for many miles. Nor is this force of the influx and efllnx to bo broke till it bas raised and dcpresHed the waters to 30, 40, or !'iO foot and abovo. And a like account is to be given of Jong and shallow channels or straits, such as the Magellanio straits, and those ch1mm·ls which t>nYiron Englm1d. The tide iu such }>Orta and straits, by the violence of the influx and efflux, is augmented above measure. But on snch shores as lie toward tho deep and open sea with a steep descent, where the waters muy freely rise and foll without that precipitation of intlux and ofllux, the proportion of tlie tides agrees with tho forces of the sun and moon. Cor. 2. Since the moon's force to move the sea is to the force of gravity as 1to2871 400, it is evident that tllis force Is far Jess than to appear sensibly in statical or hydrostatical experiments, or even in those of pendulums. It is in tho tides only that this force shows itself by any sensible effect. Cor. 3. Because the force of tho moon to move the sea is t.o tho like force of the sun as 4··1815 to 1, and those for<"es (by Cor. 14, Prop. LXVI, Hook 1) ara as the densities of the borlies of the Hnn nn<l moon and tho cubes of their apparent dianrnters conjunctly, the density of the moon will bo to tho density of tho snn as 4·4815 to 1 directly, and the cube of tho moon's diameter to tho cube of the sun's cliametor inversely; that i~ (seeing the mean apparent diameters of the moon an<l snu are 31' 1Gt" and 32' 12"), as 4 891to1 000. But the density of the snu was to tho density of the earth as 1 000 to ·1 000; and therefore the density of the moon is to the density of tho earth as 4 891 to 4. 000, or a>1 11 to 9. Therefore tho hotly of the moou is more dense ancl more earthly than the earth itself. Cor. 4. Auel since the tmo clianrntor of the moon (from the observations or astronomers) is to the tmo diameter of tho cartli as 100 to 363, the muss of matter in tho moon will lie to the mass of mutter in the earth as 1 to 39·788.

across the Atlantic Ocean, because rise in one place necessitates fall in another; also to the fact that "the great11ess of the tides depends upon the greatness of the sea." Ile imagines a pair of vertical canals, one in tlrn axil'! of the tidal spheroid and the other perpendicular thereto, both passing through the earth's center. Then, knowing that the whole weight of the water in either canal or leg is proportional to the square of its length, and that the attraction Of the earth upon a particle at its surface is 12 8()8 200 times that of the Still U]IOn the sa111e particle, the square roots of 12 868 200 and 12 sns 200 + 1, or 12 868 201, are proportional to tbe two semiaxes of the tic1hl spheroid. '.L'heir difference thus found is n, or, more accnrately, 9} Paris inches. '.L'his is about two.fifths of the result given in Book III, because the mutual attraction of the disturbed fluid particles is ignored. Ile estimates tbat tbe moon's tidal force is Gk that of the sun, instead of 4·4815, as in Cor. 3, Prop. XXXYII, and so the ranges of tides are !l inches for the sun and 4 feet for the moon. He thinks that the theoreti<'al ranr,e of tide may be doubled or trebled because of the reciprocation (oscillatory motio11) in the motion of the waters. 'l'he mass of the moon here obtained is 1/29, instead of 1/3!Vi88, the result given in the third book. Demiel Bernoulli (1700-1782). 91. In the year 17:38 the Acach;mie des Sciences at Paris proposed the problem of the tides as the subject of a prize essay. The prize was divided, in 1740, among Daniel Bernoulli, professor of anatomy and botany at Basel; Maclaurin, professor of mathematics at Edin burgh; Euler, professor of mathematics at St. Petersburg, and the Jesuit Antoine Cavalleri. The three first mentioned founded their theories upon the principle of universal gravitation, while Cavalleri adopte1l the Cartesian system of vortices (tourbillons), a system which most philosophers 11ad already abandoned because of Newton's more rational theory. 'l'he essays of Bernoulli, Maclaurin, aud Euler are to be found in Le Seur aud .Jacquier's edition of the Principia. 'l'hey bear the respective titles, "Trnitc sur le flux et reflux de la mer,"" De causa physica fluxus et relluxus maris," and" Inquisitio physica in causam 11uxus ac refluxus maris." Laplace has given a review of the essays of Rernoulli and Euler in the thirteenth book of his Mecanique Cfleste, aud Ferrel gives a similar review in the introduction to his Tidal l{esearches. Each of the three writers begins bis esi;;ay with some historical remarks on the subject. !l2. Bernoulli was the first to develop the equilibrium theory or hypothesis sufficiently far to give it a practical value in the prediction of tides; hence this theory is often associated with his name. He proceeds upon the follow in~ suppositions: 'l'hat for tillal purposes we may assume the undisturbed surface of the earth to be spherical, i. e., we may disregard the ellipticity of the earth's meridiau; that the earth is composed of concentric layers, any one of whi~h ha:;; a uniform density throughout; that either luminary causes the earth to assume the form of an ellipsoid of revolution whose axis points toward the center of the luminary; that the nucleus of the earth is practically rigid, and is surrounded by a homogenoous sea, shallow in comparisou with the radius of the earth. He determines the ellipticity of the tidal spheroid, and so the range of the tide (due to the sun), by imagining a vertical canal or well, directly under the body, cut to the earth's center, there communicating with a similar opening 90° distant from the first-an artifice employed by Newton in finding the effect of the centrifugal force at the earth's equator. He denotes the range of the solar tide by tJ and the lunar tide by o. Various theoretical values of the ranges are obtained upon assuming different laws for the density of the earth. Upon the assumption that the earth's density is uniformly that of water, Bemoulli finds fJ about 23 inches, or Newton's rmntlt. He regards this range too small to be consistent with observed tides. That most of his conclusions based on various assumptions as to density are erroneous may be seen upon comparing them with the following obvious considerations: If we give to the earth a certain mass arranged in concentric shells, the height of the tide is independent of the law of change of density along a radius. If, 011 the other hand, we take for our estimate of the earth's mass, or mean density, a portion of surface material, water for instance, then the mass will, of course, be niuch affected by tbe assumed law of increase or decrease of de11sity from the surface toward the center. Consequently any law which assumes the density to decrease from the surface toward the center will give larger tides than upon the assnmptio11 of uniform density, and vice versa for a law which supposes an increase in density below the surface. Bernoulli reaches conclusions quite opposite to these.

93. In the fifth chapter of his essay Bernoulli finds that the fall of tide from high water is proportional to the square of the sine of the moon's 11our angle-the transits of the moon are assumed to occur at the time1; of high water."' [Of course n, similar rule obtains for the height of the tide (surface of the sea) reckoned from low water. To establish these rules, assume an ellipse of small eccentricity, and upon its major and minor axes as diameters describe circles; the departure of the ellipse (along a radius) from either circle whicll it touches is proportional to the si11e of tlie angle which the radius makes with tlie oue drawn through the point of contact. 'l'liis may be readily seen upon writing the polar equation of the ellipse referred to its center.) , After observing that the solar and lunar tides may be treated separately, because either produces but a small deformation in the figure of the earth, he gives an expression for the height of the combined tide. This height, when referred to mean sea level, may be written Height of

After considering the available evidence, Bernoulli assumes the ratio of the solar to the luuar tide, or (j / o, to be -~. By aid of the expressions just obtained, he finds that at the syzygies (springs) the tides become later e.teh day, not by 50 minutes, but by 35, and at the quadratures (neaps) by 85 minutes.· He then gives a table showing how much the time of tide departs from the time of the moon's transit because of the sun's action. This seems to be the first table of its kind since the attempts of Philips and Flamsteed already referred to, and which were uot based upon the theory of gravitation. The distance between sun and moon is taken to each 100 from oo to 180°. The intervals as well as the age or rctcird of the tide are each supposed to be zero; the value of (jjo is aRsumed to be f. He computes the angle, whose sine is p, from the formula
(183)

He then converts this displacement into minutes of time by multiplying the number of degrees by, as it seems, exactly 4. His second table shows the same quantities as the first, excepting that t.hree distances of the moon-perigean, mean, and apogean-are provided for instead of the mean only; also that the age of the tide is assumed to be 20°, or one and one-half days, instead of zero. Tu is amounts to writing· the tabular values in the second table opposite an argument 20° greater than that in the first table.

94. 'l'o determine the effect of the declination of either luminary upon the tide at a given place, Bernoulli finds by spherical trigonometry the distance of the place from the pole of the tidal spheroid. Then the radius of the spheroid at the place in question l>ecomes known from the fact, already stated, that in an ellipse the radius vector is t.he half of the minor axis increased by a quantity proportional to the square of the cosine of the a1I"gle between it and the major axis. Denoting the sine of the moon's polar distance by S and the cosine hy C, the sin~ aud cosine of the polar distance of the place by sand c, also the cosine of the moon's local hour angle by y, tlien the height of the lunar tide itbove mean lunar low water (i. e., a plane~ <S below mean sea level) is (Ssy + Cc) 2 o, (Hl3) which gives for lnnar high water heig·ht. (Ss + Cc)2 o (H.IJ) or (1!)5) (- Ss + Cc) 2 <>, according- to the transit used. Expression ( l!l3) serves to explain most of the peculiarities of the luuar tide due to the moon's decliriatio11, and the latitude of the place. 'l'he declination al effect of the sun follows from analogy. Bernoulli shows how the mnge of the resultant tide of sun and moon is affected by their angular distances apart, their parallaxes, their declinations, and the latitn<le of the place eonsi1lered simultaneously, and his final expreilsion for the rauge of tide in\·olves all tl1ese effects. In this formula he assumes that observations at the particular place furnish values for the spring and neap ranges From Bernoulli's discussion it would seem that he intended his tables of phase and parallax corrections to be app1icable to all places, although, in the instance just referred to, he assume~ that Rpring alHl neap heights must be found from observation. He does 11ot state whether or not a general table could be prepared showing the effect of declination (on the semidaily tide). Hut by taking the mean of (1!)4) and (1D5) also putting y = 0 in (193) for low waters, we see that the effeet of declination is to decrease the range as the square of the cosine of the moon's declination." It would seem that he supposed fhe age or retard of the tide to be about a day and a half for all places, and so capable of being determined once for all. But he was aware of the fact that within a small extent of longitude the ltenr d1t port, high-water interval, could assume all Yalues from zero to a half lunar daS. He nates the use which might be made of the high-water inequality in keeping track of the tide wl.wre the coast line is very irrcgular.t He erroneously attributes the retard to the inertia of the water, as does Newton, but suggests that it may he due in part to the time required for the action of gravitation to reach the earth.t He agrees with Newton in the mistaken JlOtiou that the smallness of the diurnal inequality is due to the oscillation oft.he sea, so that a large tide would have a tendency to increase the otherwise small tide following it by twelve hours.§ Both writers failed to see that the tides are forced, and not free, oscillations. Bernoulli knew that recourse to observation would be necessary for ascPrtaining, at any given place, quantities like the range of tide, the lunitidal interval, and the maguitu<le of the diurnal inequality. · Near the close of his essay Bernoulli i11vcstigates the amount of rise and fall in a ~mmll in closed sea situate<l upon the equator.

95. Colin Maclaurin (1698-1746). Neither :\laclaurin nor Euler, in the prize essays already referred to, developed methods·for the reduction or vredietion of tides, hut each added to the theoretical side of the tidal problem. Maclaurin demonstrates for the first time (what Newton had assnmed without demonstration) that a homogeneous sphere when disturbed by the moon or sun l>ecomes 1 upon the equilibrium hypothesis, a prolate ellipsoid. So far as known to the present writer, :Maclaurin is the first to call attention to an effect upon the water which the earth's rotation might produce. He says in Proposition VII of bis essay:
If water lrn carried from tho south toward the north, either by the general motion of the tide or by any ot!J.,r cause what.ever, tho course of the water will t\Jereby ho deflected little by little toward the east, because the water at a prior time wiw carrie1l, by the diurnal motion, toward this sen with it greater velocity thau pertains to the more northerly place. Conversely, if tile water hn carried from the north townrcl the south, the course of the water, on account of n ~imilar cause, will L>o deflected toward tho west. From this sonrco I suspect various phenomena of the motion of the sea to ariRe,

He suspects the winds are also affected by the same dim:nal motion. This effect of the earth's rotation forms an essential part of I1aplace's dynamical theory of tides. A somewhat analogous question, viz., the effect of the earth's rotation npon a body falling freely from a great height, was discussed l>y Newton and Dr: Hooke iri 1G7U. 96. Leonard Euler (1707-1783). Euler discusses the tidal problem upon the correct assumption that the tides are caused by the horizontal component of the moon's disturbing force. But if the water have a density comparal>le to that of the earth, it is necessary to take into account the horizontal attraction of the two instantaneous high-water regions. Euler neglects this and obtains a smaller elevating effect than that given by the equilibrium hypothesis where the density of the earth is assumed to IJe that of water, and the mutual attraction of the water is properly allowed for. He expresses (§ 44 of his essay) the height of the tide due to sun and moon in spherical l1armonic functions of their :1.enith distances, carrying the expression to the fourth power of the parallaxes. Later on, he attempts to treat the tides as a problem of 1iuid motion; that Is, he attributes to the lluid particles the property of inertia which tlie equilibrium theory does not imply. It is now known that the fundamental tidal equations (first ol>tained by Laplace) have refere11ce to. the horizontal motions of' the fluid, and to the invariability of its volume. "None of these equations were 01Jtai11ed by Euler; be took into accou11t the vertical oscillation only, and neglected the condition of continuity. For a somewhat more detailed review of Euler's essay than is he1·e given, the reader is referred to the iutroduction of Ferrel's Tidal Researehes, which includes the most of Laplace's criticisms npo11 it. 97 . ·Joseph Jerome Lefranr;aii; de Lalande (1732-1807).

The treatise of Lalande, like those of Riccioli and Gassendi, is of special interest in connection with the historical side of the subject of tides. 98. Jacques Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (1737-1814). In memoirs written about 1790,· this writer accounts for the semidaily and semiannual tides and tlowings of the sea by the daily and yearly meltings of the ice caps in the northern and southern polar regions. He believes the heat of the moon may have some small share in melting the snow and ice. Be states that certain lakes have tides from the similar periodic melting of snow and ice on the surrounding mountains. The annual fiow of water from the polar regions (as evidenced by icebergs always moving toward the equator) results, he thinks, naturally enough from the hypothesis of the elder Cassinis which regards the polar diameter of the earth the greatest diameter instead of the least. Saint-Pierre's hypothesis is examined by Woods in the Philosophical Magazine, Vol. 8 (1800). S. Bennett, in a small volume entitled "A new Explanation of the Bbbing and Flowing of the Sea, upon the Principles of Gravitation,"t makes most of the points against the commonly accepted notion that the vertical attraction of the moon produces the tides, and shows that the horizontal attraction is the real cause. A rather important remark of his is that since the moon's daily period exceeds that of the su11, the lunar tides will get under way better than the solar and so would become greater even if the forces to which they are due were equal.

LAPLACE.' .

99. Laplace's work upon the tides occurs in Books IV and XIII of his Mecanique Celm;te. Near the beginning of the thirteenth book he giw.s an account of his work in this direction and of the results obtained. For our purpose, it has seemed best to give this account at the outset. It will be noticed that his aim is theoretical rather than practical; i.e., he tries to develop a rational theory for explaining tidal phenomena. In most of his comparisons between theory and observation, however, be virtually falls back upon the equilil>rium hypothesis; but his kinetic theory enables him to explain in a general way certain features· of the tide which do not accord with conditions of static equilibrium. For insta11ce, the comparatively small diurnal tide at Brest; also the fad that relative sizes of partial tides of nearly but not exactly equal periods may depend in part upon the motion in right ascension of the tidal bodies. 'rhe work of I1aplace has been of much practical importance in the treatment of tides. He points out the three different species of oscillations and shows how to obtain the constants involved in them from tidal observations. In fact, up to the present time the predictions for the F.rench ports have been based upon the formula obtained by Laplace for the port of Brest. His prinriple of forced oscillations has since become, in the hands of Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), the foundation of the most practical as well as the most accurate system known for the treatment of tidal observations. The following authors have commented upon, expounded, or restated the principal parts of Laplace's tidal theory: Nathaniel Bowditch, M<;cani<1uc Gdestc, by the :.\farquis de la Place, Translated with a Commentary, Vol. I (1829), Yol.

100. The mot.ion of fluids which _cov<'r tlrn planets was then n subject almost entirely new, when, in 177'1, I undertook to trent it. Aided hy the discoveries which ha<l just heen m:ide in tho calculus of partial difforouoes and in tho theory of flu ill motio11, discoveries in which d' Alembert had a hirgo share, 1 published in tho M6moirs do l'Acad<:mio des Sciences, for tlrn year 1775, the differential 01111atio11s of tho motio11 of the fluids which cover t.Jw earth, when they are attracted by tho sun a11d moon. I first appliecl these equations to the problem which <l' Alembert bud triecl in vain to solve; viz., that of the oscillations of a tlnicl whinh would cover tho eart,h aesumecl to be sphericitl and without rotatio11, supposing the attracting 11tar in motion aron11rl our planet. I gave the general solution of this problem, regardless of the density of the fluid anrl its initial stat<,, assm11i11g that each molecule of the fluid experiences a rosi11tance proportional to its velocity; th is ma1fo me see that the primitive conditions of the motion are :rnuihilated in the loug rnn hy the friction uncl 1rn1all viscosity of fluid. Bnt the i11spectio11 of differe11tial cquatio11s very soo11 made me recognize the necessity of having reg-ard to the rotary motion of th11 earth. I therefore considerocl this motion, and eBpocially strove to determine tho oscillations of the fluid which are independent of its initial Btate, and which alone are permanent. ThcHo OHcillations are of three classes. Those of the Hrst class ar11 independent of tho rotary motion of tho earth, and their <fotorminution offers few difficulties. The oscillatio11s (]opendeut upon the earth's rotation, and whose period is about oue day, form the seconcl claHs. Finally, the thircl c·lnss is compoHed of oscillations whosn perio<l iH about h:ilf a day: they am considerably larger than the others in our porl8. I determined the diverse oscillations, exactly in 1mch cases as it is possible, and by rapi1lly conYorgent approximations in the other cases. Th11 excess of one high water o\'er an acljacent one-the ticlo·proclucing body heing in tho Holst.ice-depends upon oscillations of tho second clasB. This excess is Hearcely sensible at Brost., where, according to the tlu·or,v of Newton, it should ho very large. This great geometer :mcl his successors attl'ibute<l, as I have sairl, this discrepancy hetweon tlwir formulm and the ohsorvntions to tho inertia of thn wuters of thll oeean. But analysis made me sne that it depemls upon tho law of depth of the sea. I then Honght tho law which wonlcl 'Pierre Simon, :\l:tr<Jllis de Laplace (1749-1827).

render this excess zero, and I found that the depth of the sea for that purpose shoulll he constant. Finally, assuming the figure of the earth elliptical, which also gives the sea an elliptical figure of equilibrium; r gave the general express10n for iunqualitieH of the seco1H! class, and I concluded therefrom this l't!marlrnblo proposition; \'iz., that tho mo\'cmtmts of the terrestrial axis itro the same us they would be if the sea formed with the earth a solitl mass. This was contrary to the opinion ot" geometcrH, aud especially cl' Alembert, who, m his important work on the precession of the equinoxes, had atl\'anced the theory that thn fluidity of the sea took from it all influence upon this phenomenon. )I y analysis made me recognb:e, moreover, the gene ml con di ti on for the stab1li ty of the sea's eq ui Ii hri um. GeomoterR, <'Onsidering tho equilibrium of a fluitl pfaced upon an elliptic ~pheroid, had pointed out that in tlatteuiug its tigure a little it tonds to return to its initial state only in the case where the ratio of its density to that of the spheroid should be below ft; and the~· hat! made out of this cond1t1on the con<iit.ion of the stability of tho equilibrium of the fluid. But it is not sufficient in this research to consitl<>r a state of repose of the tluid very near to the state of equilibrium; it iH necessary to assume in this fluid any very small initial motion and to determine the necessary contlit1on for having the motion alwa~·s remain within narrow limits. In looking at this problem from a general point of view, I found thnt if the mean density of the earth exceed that of the 11en this tluid, disturbed by any causes whatever from its state of equilibrium, will never deviate therefrom save by very small quantitie8; but that the deviations might be very large if this condition were not fulfilled.* Finally I determiued the oscillationH of tho atmosphere as those upon the ocean which it surrounds, and I fount! that the attractions of the sun and moon cun not produce the constant movement from east to west which we observe under the numo of tl"aclc winds. Tho oscillations of tlrn atmosphere produce in the height of the barometer small oscillat1ons whose extent at the equator is a half millimetre and which deserve the attention of observerH. Tho preceding researches, although very general, are still far from representing the observations upon the t.ides in onr ports: tlwy assume the surface of the terrestrial spheroid regular and entirely coverod by the sen; ant! we feel that the !~reat irregularities of this surface ought to consitlerubly modify the movement of the waters by which it is covere1l only in part. In fact, experience shows that a<'cessory circumstunees produce considerable varieties in the heigl1ts and in the intervals of the tides at ports O\'eu when very near ono another. It is impossible to submit these varieties to calculation bocause the circumstances upon which they depe1Hl are not known; and even when they are known the extreme difficulty of the prohlem woul<i prevent its solution. However, in the midst of the numerous modifications of the motion of the sea due to circumstances, this motion preserves, with thn forces which protlnre it, ratios suitable for indicating the nature of these forces anti for verifying the lnw of the attraction of the sun and moon upon tho sea. Inquiry into these ratios of the causes t11 their offects is not less useful in natural philosophy than ht 1Im direct solution of t.he problems, either for verif.ying the existence of these causes or for tletermining tho laws of their effects; it is of use more frequently, alHl it is thus, with the calculus of prohubilities, a happy supplement to the ignorimcn anti the feebleness of the human miud. In the present question I make uso of tho following principle, which may he useful on other occasions: "The state of a system of bodies in which the initilLI contlitionH of the motion have disappeared through the resistance which this motion experiences iB periodic, like the forces which animate it." From this I conclmlecl that if the sea is actuatetl by 1t periodic force expressed by the cosin11 of au angle which iucreuses uniformly with the time; there results from it a partial tide oxpressnd by the t:'oeiue of an angle increasing in the same manner, hut in which the constant involved in this angle and the coefficient of this cosine may be, by virtue of accessory circumstances, ver~· different from the same constants in the expression for the forcn arnl can be determined only through obHervation. Tho t·xpression for tho actions of the sun nut! moon upon the sea can be developetl in a. convergent series of similar cosineH. \\"hence ariso as nmny parti1il tides as, by the principle of the coexistence of small oscillatio11s, being added together, constitute the tide which is olJservctl in a port. It is from this point of view that I have investigated the tid<'s in Hook IV. In order to t"Onnect with these tho diverse constants of tlrn 1mrtial tides, I consitlert'd en eh partial title as produced by the action of a star which moves uniformly in the plane of the e'luutor. The titles whoso !H'riod is about half a day ure due to the action of stars whosti proper motion is very slow iu comparison with the rotary motion of the earth; and us the angle of the cosine term which expresses the action of one of tht'st' stars is a multiple of the rotation of the earth pluH or minus a multiple of the 1iroper motion of tho star; nncl us besides the constants of these eosiue terms which express tho tidt·s produced h~· two stars Hhonltl h:n·e the sitme ratios nH the const.;1nts of the cosine ter111s which express tlwir actions, provitlotl the proper motions were eqnal: I have supposetl that tho ratios variotl from ono star to another proportionally to the difference of their proper motions, The error of this hypothe><is, if there ho any, has no sensible intlucnce npon the principal r!'snlts of my cnlculat.ions. The greatest variations in the heights of the titles in our port8 are due to the net.ion of tho sun autl rnoon, supposed t.o mo\·e uniformly in their orbits anti always at the sn.me tlistunce from ~he earth. Bnt for ohtaiuiug the l:iw of these variations it is necessary to so combine the observations that all the otllt'l' variutions dis11ppear from tho result. Jt, is this whieh we obtain in consitlering tho heights of the high waters above the neighboring low waters in the syzygies ant! quaclruturos taken in etprnl number toward each equinox aml toward each solstice. By thif. means the tides which are independent of the rotation of the earth and those having a period of nhout a tiny should disappear, as woll as thetidrs protlucecl by tho variation of the distance of the HUii from the earth. ln .-onsidering three consecutive syzygies or three consecutivo quadratures, ant! in doubling the intermediate one, we en.use tho tide which is protluced by the variation of the distance of the moon to disappear; becausP if this stur i8 in perigee in one Hyzygy it is very near apogee in the syzygy following; and the compensation increases in nocurnc~· proport.ionately to the greater number of observations employed, By this procetlure the intluenco of the wintlH upon *Cf.

the result of obaenations becomes almost nothing; for if tho wind elevates tho height of a high water it elevates by the same amount thl'l neighboring low water, and its effect disappears in tho difference of the two heights. Thus, by so combining obson·ations that their combination presents only one element, wo arc able to determine successively all elements of tho phenomena. The analysiH of probabilities furnishe8 a method still more sure for ohtaiuinl-{ the8e elements and which we can designate by tho name of the most ad1Ja11tageo11s method. It consi11ts in forming betwo!l1i tho eleruoutH as many equations of condition as there are observation equations. \Ve reduce hy the rules of this method tho number of these equations to that of the element!:! which we determine in solving the t1quations so retluce<l. It is by this process that :\Ir. Bouvanl has constructed his excellent tables of Jupiter, Saturn, and Ura11ns. But the observations of the tide beiug far from attaining the precisfon of astronomical observations, the ~rcat number of them which it is necessary to employ in order that their errors countorbalauce one another doe!:! not permit us to apply to them tho most advantageous method. 101. Upon tho invitation of the Acadcmie des Sciences and at the beginning of the last century, observations woro made upon the tides in the port of Brest during six consecutive yoars. It is with these observations, published by Lalande, that I have compared my formulm in the book cited. The situation of this port is very favorable to this kilHI of observations: it communicates with the sea by a vast canal, at the head of which the city is built. ThuR the irregularities of tho motion of the sea come into the port much weakened, nearly a.s the oscillations which the irregular motion of a vessel produces in the barometer are lessoned by a choking made in the tube of this instrument. Moreover, the tides being considerable at Brost, accidental variations are only a small part of them. If we multiply the observations of these tides a little we notice a great regularity which the little river that loses itself in the largt1 bi1y of this port does not alter. Struck by this regularity, I proposed to the Government to have a now series of observations of the tides made at Brost, arnl that it be continued at least during one period of tho lunar node. Under these circumstanccH the obsen·ations were undertaken. Those new observations date from the first of .Juno, 1806, and since that time they have been continued each day without interruption. 'Ve have treated those belonging to the year 1807, an<l the fifteen following years. I owe to tho indefatigable zeal of Mr. Bouvard whatever concernt1 astronomy, and the immense calculations which the comparison of my analysis with the observations has exacted. He has employed in it nearly six thousand observations: the rcRults of those calculations are consigned to the tables which we shall see furtht1r on. For ohtiiining the height of the high waters and their variation, which, n<'ar the maximum aud 1nillinwm is proportion11,l to the square of tho time, we have treated near each equinox and near ·iach solstice three consC>cutive syzygies betwC>on which the equinox or the solstice was comprised: we huvt· don bled the results of the int11rmcdiate syzygy in order to destroy the effects of the lunar parallax. \Ve have taken in each syzygy tho height of tho evening high water above the morning low water of tho da.y which precodm! sy1.ygy, of the day of syzygy, and of tho four following days; because tho maximum. of the tides falls nearly in th" middle of thh1 interval: the choice of hours is based upon the notion that observatiorn1 made <luring the day shoul1l therefore be more snro and more exact. We have made for each of tho sixteen years one sum out of the heights of the tides of th(' corresponding days in the equiuoctial· syzygies and a similar sum relative to tho solHtitial syzygies, and we have therefrom ascertained the 1naxima of tho heights of the high wat1ll's near the t1yzygios, either t1quinoetial or solstitial, and the variation'! of theHe heights near their niaxima: The inspection of those heights and thoir variations show the regularity of this species of observations in the port of Brest. In tho quadrature8 we have followed a similar procoss, save with the difference that we have taken tho execss of tho morning high wat~~ aho\·e the evening low water of the day of the quadrature, and of the three days which follow it. Tho iucroase of the quadrature tides, starting with their 111inim11111, being much more rapid than the diminution of tho syzygial tides, starting with their maximum, we ought to restrict to a very small interval tho law of variation proportional to the square of the times. 'Ve have formed for each of tho sixteeu years tables similur to those of the syzygial tides. All these tables put in ovidenc11 tho influence of the declination of the suu und moon, not only upon tht· alisolnte heights of the tides, but also on their variatious. Several savants, and especially Lalande, have called this in {]ueuco in doubt, because, instead of considering a groat number of observations, they have confined themselves tn some isolated oh&ervatione when the sea, by tho effect of accidental causeH, was elevated to a great height towartl the solstices. But the most Himplo application of the calculus of probabilities to the results of l\lr. Bom·ard is Hufliciont to see that the probability of the influence of the declinatjon of the stars exceeds aud is much superior to that of a great number of facts on which we do not permit ourselves to huve any doubt. We have determined from the variations of tho tides near their·maxima aud 1nini111a, the interval by which these 111a.rima and these minima follow the syzygieH and the quadratures, and we have found this interval to be a day and a half, very nearly, which is perfectly in accord with what the old observations gave me in Book IV. The smno agreement takes place relative to the sizes of these ma:rima and mini1na and in reference to tho variations of the heights of tho tides going from these points, so that nature after a cycle is found conformable to herself. The intorval of which I htwc just spoken depends upon constants under tho cosinu signs in the expression for the two principal tides duo to the action of the sun and moon. The eorresponding constants of the expression of the forces are differently modified by the accessory circumstances: at tho moment of syzygy the lunar tide precedes tho Holar tide, and it is only u day and a half afterwards, the lunar tide retarding each day upon the solar tide, that these two tides <'oincide and thus produce the niaximuni of tho resultant tides. A similar modification takes place in tho constants which multiply the cosines: thence there results an augmontatio1,1 in the action of tho stars on the sea. I have given in Book lV the means of recognizing this augmentation, which I have found about one-tenth from the old obsorvatious; but, however the observations of the tides at quadrature agree on this point with the observations ofsyz~·ginl tides, I have said that so delicate un element would require a very much greater number of observations. The calculations

of l\lr. nouvanl have confirmed the existence of this increment and have increased it t.o about one-fourth for the 111oon. Tile <idermination of this ratio is necessary in order to ascertain from ti<fal observations the true ratios of the actions of the sun and moon, upon which ratio depends tho phenomena cf the l>ro<·ession of tho equinoxes and of tho nutation of tho earth's axis. In correcting tho actions of tho stars on the soa for tho inero111ent8 duo to the accessory circumstances, we find expressed in sexagesimal secomls !J" ·4 for tho nutation, 6"·8 for tho lunar equations of tho tables of the trnu, and for the mass of tho moon~', that of tlw earth. Those result8 nro very little different from those given by tho discussion of astronomical observations. Tho acconlanco of values obtaino<l by methods so divPrso is very remarkable. It is in comparing with my formulm tho maxima and minima of the observed heights of tho tides that tho actions of the sun and moon upon the se1~, and their augmentations have been determined. Tho variations of the heights of tho ti<les near these points are a series necessary for the purpose; in substituting, then, tho values of these actions in my formulm W<1 should return to very nearly tho observed variations. It is this that, in fact, we fin<l. This accordance is a grand confirmation of the law of universal gravitation; it receives a new confirmation from tidal observations taken at syzygies when the moon is near apogee or near perigee. I hnv<· considered in Book IV only tho 1li1forence of the heights of tho tides for these two llO. :itions of the moon. I consider further tho variation of these height.s going from their maxima, and on these two pointii my formulw represent the observatious. Tho times of the tides and retards from day to day offer the same varietieb ns their heights. Mr. nouvard hm1 formed of them tables for the tides which ho had employed in t.he determination of their heights. We there clearly see tho influence of tho doclinations of tho stars and of the hmar parallax. Those observations, compared with my fortnnlm, offer tho same accordance as th11 observations upon the heights. 'Vithout doubt we might make tho small anomalies, which comparisons st.ill present, disappear by properly determining the constants of ea.ch partial tideThe principle by which I have united these diverse constants cannot be rigorously mm.ct. Perhaps also the quanti. tics which we neglect in adopting the principle of tho coexistence of oscillations might become sensible in largo tides. I have here contented myself with noting these small anomalies in order to direct those who would extend these calculations when the observations of the tide11 which arc being made at Brest, and which are deposited at the royal observatory, shall be numerous onough for making certain that tho anomalies are not due to errors of the observations. But before modifying tho principles which I have made use of, it will be necessary to carry further the anal~·tical approximations. Final!~·, I have considered tlrn tide whoso porio<l is about a day. In com puring the differences of two cousecutiYe high waters and two consecutive low waters in a great number of solstitial syzygies, I have determined the amplitude of this tide and tho hour of its 111ari111u11i in tho port of Brest. I found its range to be about one-fifth of n meter a.ml about one-tenth of a day for tho time by which it iirecedes the time of the marimuni of the somidiurnal ti<fo at Brest. Although its amplitude be not ono-thirtieth of the amplitude of the sornidiurnal tide, at the same timo tl10 generating forces of these two tides are nearly e11u11l, which shows how differently the accessory circumstances influence the amplitudes of the tides. One will not be surprised, if ho consider that in the case whore tho surface of the earth is regular and entirely covered by tho sea, the diurnal tide should dis1tppear if the depth of tho sen. were corn·tant. The accessory circumstances might oven make the semidiurnal inequalities disappear in a port and makn tho diurnal inequalities ver~· sensible. Thon there is only one tide ouch day, and this disappears when tho stars are in the equator. It is this which has been observed at Batsham, a port of the Kingdom of Tonquin, and in some islands of the South Son. I shall observe, relatively to these oircumstanoos, that some belong to the entire sen and nm duo to canseH very remote from the port where the tides are observed. 'Ve cannot doubt, for example, that tho mululation!! of the Atlantic Ocean and South Sea, reflected by the eastern coast of America, which extends almost from one pole 'to the other, should have a groat influence upon the tides of tho rort of Brest. It is principally upon tlrnse circumstances that the phenomena, which are nearly the same in our ports, depend. Such appears to be tho retard of tho higheat tide after the instant of syzygy. Other circumstances nearer the port, Buch us the neighboring coasts or straits, produce thn differences which one obsen·os between tho heights and times of the tides in ports near together. From this it follows that~t partial tide has not, with the latitude of the port, the ratio indicated by the force which produces it; since it depends upon similar tides corresponding to the latitudes far away and ornn in another hemisphere. 'Vo can, then, determine only by observation tho sign and amplitude of this tide. The phenomena o'f tho tides of which I have just spoken depend upon the terms of the development of the action of tho stars divided by tho cube of their distances from the earth, the only ones which we have considere<I heretofore. But the 111oon is sufficiently near the earth for rendering the terms of tho expression of its action divided by the fourth power of its distance sem1ible in the results of a groat number of observations; for we know by tho theory of probabilities that the number of observations supplements their want of precision, and put in evidence inequalities much Iese than tho errors of which each observation is susceptible. 'Ve may oven by this theory assign the number of observations necessary for acquiring a great probability that the error of the reAult ohtained is included within gh·en limit11. I have thought, therefore, tlmt the influence of the terms of the action of the moon divided by the fourth power of her distance to tho ourth might be manifest in the combination of the numerous observations discussed by l\lr. Douvard. The tides corre11ponding to tho t.erms divided by the cube of the distunco give no difference bntwoen the tides of the new moons und those of tho full moons, but those which have for divisor the fourth power of her distance make a difference between these tides. They 11roduce a tid<· whose period is about a third of a day. The observations of Mr. Bouvnrd ·lisoussed under this pomt of \·low irnlicato with a great probability tho existcnc<· of this purtial tide. They establish, further, without any doubt, that tho action of tl1e moon for producing tide at nrest iH greate1· when hBr declination is south than when it is north, which ean be duo only to the terms of thn lunar action divided by the fourth power of the d1sta.nco.

We see by this expositiou that the re~earch containing the general ratios between the phenomena of the tides aml the actions of the sun and moon on the sea supplement in a happy fashion the impossibility of integrating the <liffereutial e<prnt.ions of its motion and the ignorance of the necessary data. for determining the arbitrary fnnetious w:i:.. :h enter into their integrals; thence results a complete certitude that these phenomena have as their only cause the attraction of these two bodies conformable to the law of universal gravitation.

Referring to this expression Laplace remarks: As tire tlrree quantities r, v, l/J, vary witlr extreme slorv11ess, in comparison with tire rotary motion of the eartlr; tire three
p1·eceding te1·ms p1·oducc three d(ffe1·ent species of osoillations. Tltc periods of tire oscillations of tire jil'st kind are l'cry long; tltcy arc indepcnde11t of tire rotary motion of the earth, a11d dcpc11d toholly upon the 111otio11 of the body L in its 01·bit. The p1'1'iocls of the 0Hcillatio11s of the second species depend chiefly on the rnfar!f motion of the eai·th nt; thefr duration is nearly one day.

The equation (215) is a linear differential equation; hence it foll0\v8, he remarks, that these three species of oscillations can exist together, without being confounded with each other; therefore, we may consider them separately. These three kinds of tides are then discussed by putting N successively equal to O, 1, and 2. 104. o.~cilla.tion.of the fir.~t species.-The expression for e indicates that for small values of i as in case of oscillation of the first species, the east-and-west motion of the fluid particle may be great in comparison with the other motions, provided thern is no fluid friction involved.

These values of i, s, y, a and a' satisfy the fundamental equation (215); moreover, y has a form analogous to the corresponding term in the tide-producing potential. This is tlierefore a solution uf Laplace's tidal equation of the required form. When the depth is such that q is small this oscillatio11, and so the diurnal inequality becomes small.

UNITED f!TATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Observations show that at Brest
(251)

very nearly (§ 31, Bk. IV). With this assumption, the above forrnulre, all of which follow from the equilibrium theory, enable one to verity the theoretical part of the statements here quoted:
We Bhall now rccapit1tlate in a f~w wordB the principal phenomena of the tideB, and their relation with the laws of uniVMBal u1·al!itatio11. \Ve have generally considered these phenomena near their maxima. un<l niinima, and we ha,·e divided them into two cla8ses; the one rclath·e to the heights of the ti1les, tho other relath·e to the hours of the tides, and their inter\·als. \Vo shall now examine separately these two classes of phenomena. Tho heights of tho tides in each port., at their 111a.r.i1111w1 near the syzygies, an<l at their mini11111111 near the quadratures, are tho data of tho obsorvati01m, which best show tho ratio of the actio111> of the snn ancl moon upon the ti<les; and by means of this ratio, tho vdrious phenomena of tho tides, which result from the theory of universal gravitation. One of these phenomena, which fo very }!roper for the verification of the theory, ii> tho law of the diminution of tho tides from the time of ?ll(!Ximum, or the law of t!ltlir increase from tho millimum. We have seen in [2593', 2716], ·that tho theory of gravity accords pc::fectly with the observations in this res}lect. These laws of tho decrease and increase of the tides vary with tho declinations of the sun and moon: we ha,·o seen in [2590, 2592J, that their decrea8e 11ear the ByzyuicB of the equi11oxes, iB to theil' co1·r.,Hpondinu dec1·eaBe near the ByzygieB of the BolBticcs, in the ratio of 13 to 8; and that this result is conforruahle to th~ theory of gravity. t \Vo have Heen lilrnwise, [2717', 27.18'], that the increment of tho tidcB, counted .from the mininwm near the quadrat111·eB of the equiuoxeB, i· to the correBpondi11g increment near the quadratureB of the BOIBtices, aB 2 lo 1; and that the theory of gravity givei> nearly the same ratio. t According to this theory, the height of the total tide, at itB maxinium near the syzyuies of the cquinoxeB, iB to the correBpondin[! height 11ea1· the Byzygies of the solstices, nearly aB the Bqua1·e of the radiua is to the Bq11are of the coBineB of the declinations of these bodies 11ear the solsticcB; and we havo seen in [2590, 2592], that this differs hut little from the result of observations. By the same theory, the exceBB of tit~ heightB of the total tides, in their minimum, near the quadratureB of the BOlBtices, abot'<l their correHpo11di11g heightB, 11ear the quadratureB of the equinoxeB, iB the Banie aH the exceBB of the heiuhts of the total tides iii their maximum, near the Byzygie& of the equi1wxe·, abore their con·espo11di11g heights 1wai· the syzygicB of the BolBtices; and we have seen [2590, 2592, 2717', 2718'] tliat this is exactly conformable to the theory.t The influence of the moon npon the tides increases, by the pri11ciple of g1·avity, aB the cube of ilB para liar; nnd hy [2608, 2623, &c], this is so exactly conformable to observBtion, that we might haYe deduced from obser\·ations the law of this influence. The phenomena of the intervals of the tides accord equally well with the theory, as those of their heights. A.ccor11ing to the theory, lfte daily retardation of the tideB, at their maxinium, near the syzygieB, is 011/y about half what it ia at their 1;1i11imum, near the quadrat11rcs. In the firRt case it is nearly 27' 9 [2757], and in the last eo..~e 55' [28311. We have seen in [2745, 2809], that tho observations differ bnt little from this result of the theory.II The retardation of the ticleB varies with the clcclinationB of the bodit'B. .dcco1·ding to the theory, it iB ureater in the syzygieB of thesolBtices, than in thoBe of the equinoxes, in the ratio of8 to 7. In the quadrature· of tho cq11ino:res, it is [!Teater than in those of the BolsticeB, in the ratio of 13 to 9. \Ve have seen in [2777, 2839'], that tho observations give nearly the same ratios.II The diBtanco of the 11won fro1n the earth h«B an influence on ;the retardation of the tideB. According to tho theory, an increaBe of 011e 111inute in the semi-diameter of 1110 moon, 1wod11ccB an i11creasc of 258 11 [2783] in. tltiB retardation, in thR BYllYf/icB, and only 90'' [284.7] in the quadratureB; and we have seen in [28-l7], that this agrees with tho observations, and conforms in every respect, relatively to the tides, to the law of universal gravitation.~ We ha.vo treated folly on the ebb and flow of the soa; because it is ono of the results of the attraction of the heavenly bodies most obvious to us, and the law which regulates it can bo examined at every moment. It is hoped that the theory of the tides hero gi'Ven will i1uluce ohserverH to attend to the subject, in ports which, like Brest, are well situatocl for such observations. Accurate observations, eoutinue<l during a period of tho revolution of the moon'11 nodes, might fix with precision the olements of the theory of tho ebb and flow of tho tide, and perhaps make sensible th11 small oscillations depending on tho inverse ratio of the fourth power of the distance of the moon from the earth, which have heretofore been confounded with the errors of the obi>orvations. · ·

He adds that the interval from syzygy to maximum tides and the interval from quadrature to minimum tides m<iy be regardcrl as equal. This is in accord with the old observatio11s, which gave 1·50724- and 1·5077 (Bk. IV,§§ 24, 31 ).

Thus, by the effect of tho rotation of tho earth antl accosBory oircumstances, tho diurnal title is reduced to nearly one-third [of its theoretical \"aluo], while the 8emidlurnu.l tido liecomes multipliet! by lli. However, this grout difforonco ought not surprise us, if we con8ider that, by Book IV, the rotation of tho earth tlest.roys th1i diurnal tide inn sea everywhere of oqnal depth; 1111d that if the depth of the sea is rlii of tho terrestrial rndins, or about 9,000 metres, the height.~ oftbe semidiurnal tide in the syzygies is 11 metres.

CHAPTER VIII.
WORK SINCE THE TIME OF LAPLACE.

109. Dr. Thomas Yomig (1773-1829). The tidal theory of Dr. Young is contained in the Encyclopredia Britannica, 8th edition; article, Tides.· He seems to have been the first to distinctly suggest an extensive system of cotidal lines. But iu reference to it he adds: If, however, we actually make such an attempt, we shall soon find how utterly inadequate the observations that have been recorded are, for the purpose of tracing the forms of tho lines of contemporary high water with accuracy or with certainty although they are abundantly sufficient to show the impossibility of deducing the time of high water at any given place from the Newtonian hypothesi11, or even from that of Laplace, without some direct observation.

Somewhat after the manner of Euler he first treats the tidal problem by the equilibrium theory, using the horizontal component of the tidal force. He does not fail to notice the necessity of taking into account the attraction due to the high-water regions when the density of the water is considerable. Ile states as theorems that the (horizontal) disturbing force of a body varies as the sine of twice its altitude; that an oblong spheroid with its axis passing through the disturbing ·body is a form of equilibrium; that the tide will be propagated with a velocity equal to the velocity acquired by a body falling through half the depth of the fluid· (Lagrange's rule); that ''the oscillations of the sea and of lakes, constituting the tides, are .subject to laws exactly similar to those ot' pendulums . . ." Besides these he states theorems relating to the disturbing attraction of the meniscus of water, to the reflection of waves, and to certain differential equations. He introduces fluid friction into his equations, generally regarding it as proportional to the square of the velocity. The arbitrary constants entering into his solution, being assumed at pleasure give possible explanations for phenomena observed in various places: such as unusually large or small tides; also, whether high water or low water should occur at the time of transit. He finds that the "age" of the tide may be explained either by the difference of the velocities of sun and moon, or by the resistance due to friction. In fact, he was the first to mention the latter explanation. His equations refer to a single oscillating particle without reference to the ocean as a whole, and so their solution must be regarded as giving results analagous to nature, but not as being a complete solution of the tidal problem. This manner of treating the subject, while open to criticism from a theoretical point of view, is in line with most working hypotheses and especially that underlying the harmonic analysis. In further anticipation of this analysis, it may be noted that he gives some developments of tidal forces, and that he makes the following significant statement:
There is indeed little doubt, that if we were provided with n. sufficiently correct series of minutely accurate obsen·ations on the tideR, made, not merely with a view to the times of low nnd high water, but rather to the heights at the intermediate times, we might by degrees, with the assistance of the theory contained in this artlch1, form almost as perfect a set of tables for tl1e motions of the ocean as we have already obtainc>d for those of the celestial bodies, which are the more immediate objects of tho attention of the practical astronomer. There is some reason to hope that a system of such observations will speedily be set on foot by a public authority; and it will be necessary, in pursuing the calculation, on the other hand, to extend the formula for the forces to the case of a sea performing its principal oscillation in a direction oblique to the meridian, as stated in tho beginning of this section.

The results of lVeber brothers' experiments on waves are published in their treatise entitled Wellenlehre auf Experimente gegriindet (1825). In this book reference is made to nearly all previous researches on waves.

110. Henry R. Palmer.· This engineer has given an account of a self.registering tide gauge which he designed aud used in recording tides in the port of London. A l.10l111w iron float rises and falls with the tide within a protected well or float box. A chain passes over a barrel or float wheel. Two ends of the chain rest upon the ground, "so that the weight of the chain on each side of the barrel is always equal.'' Shafting connects the float wheel with a pinion which, workiug in a rack, moves the recording point or pencil. The record is made upon paper passing over a large drum, and wound up on a smaller one, Hourly impres. sions, in the figure of an arrow and along the margin of the sheet, are made by means of a punch actuate1l by a hammer and cam wheel. The direction of the arrow is that of a weather vane on the top of the tide house. He proposes a counterpoise equal to the resistance of the friction of those parts which the clock hm; to move. In 1833 George Rennie communicated to the British association a paper entitled "Report on the progress and present state of our knowledge of hydraulics as a branch of engineering." The portion of the paper (B. A. A. S. Report, 183·!, pp. 415 et seq.) concerning the flow of rivers is of considerable interest, especially from an historical point of view. 111. Sir John W. Lubbock (1803-1865). The writings of I~ubbock on tides are, for the most part, contained in the Philosopical Transactions and British Association Reports covering the period 1831 to 1837. Besides these papers may be mentioned his account of Bernoulli's paper, also An Elementary Treatise on Tides (1839). In his first paper on the tides of London t he discusses high· water observations extending over 19 years, beginning with 1808. He adopts the (half) hour of transit as one of the arguments of tabulation and for the other, according to the iueqnality concerned, the time of year (month), moon's horizontal parallax, or declination. He also separa.tl's the upper and lower transits for the month of June, thus obtaining the diurnal inequality for that month for each hour of transit. In bringing out the various inequalities he makes use of all observed tides and not of certain groups as did J_,aplace. Tabulations according to his method have been quite extensively used in the formation of the tide tables for the coasts of Great llritain. Whewell, Ferrel, and others have, with certain modifications, followed this method first laid down by Lubbock. Upon consulting available authorities, he prepares two charts, one for the coasts of Great Britain and one for the world; on these are written the hour of tide (at full and change) in Greenwich time, also in local time (i. e., the establishment). Although he does not actually draw cotidal lines, he introduces the term "cotidal line" which be defines as a" series of points at which it is high water at the same instant."f Lubbock early reaches the conclusion that the constant implying the moon's mass so varies from place to place that the moon's mass as determined therefrom and after the manner of Laplace, must be unreliable. He also finds that the variation in the retard from place to place is sometimes difficult to account for. The London high waters being deficient in diurnal inequality it is from the Liverpool tides (Phil. Trans., 1836) that Lubbock deduces the magnitude of this inequality. He tabulates it with reference to the hour of transit and the time of year (and so for the various declinations of the moon). He finds the maximum value to occur about six days after the extreme declination of the moon and the dittereuce in high-water heights there to be about 1 foot. Ile says: "The diurnal inequality in the interval appears to be insensible [at Liverpool]." The observed corrections for parallax and decliuation do not at first agree with the theory of Bernoulli. But Lubbock points out the cause of this disagreement in n, paper read before the Hoyal Society, June 16, 1836. His results previously published were obtained by referring the tides to the immediately preceding transit; but in this and in subsequent papers, such a preceding transit is used as will nearly allow for the retard of the tide. The parallax and declinational corrections then conform much more closely to theory. He says:
The vnriations in the intervnl between two Rncces~iYe transits of the moon are, in fact, of the e11me order in amount as those in the interval between the moon's transits and the time of high water due to the variations in ·"Description of a graphical register of tides and wirnls.''

Co11cerning tlte connection between the height of the barometer aud that of the tidl', he says:
~1. I>a.ussy ha& ascertain~il that at Brest the height of high water varies inversely as the height of th" barometer, an<l that the ocean rises 0·223 metre, or 8·78 inches, for :t 1lepression of 0·0158 metre, or 0·622 inch, iu the barometer·. · . . . . . \Ve may say roughly th1it at Liverpool a fall of one tenth of au inch iu the barometer mises the tille an inch, cwteris J1arib11H. The ti mo of high water appeared not to be mnch affected. It appear~ that north-easterly wiulls at Lh·erpool llqlress tho tiilo, and sonth-weskrly winds raise it. As northerly wind!! rais1~ the harometer and southerly wind· depre"H it, it will he llifficnlt, if not impossible, to separate the effect of winds and that of the variation in the presi;ure of the atmospher" from each otber. Bnt if the tale originates at a very remote 1listanc'' 011 the surfaco of the earth, t.he atmospheric pressure tlwre has probably more influence upon tho pheuo111e11a than the pressuro in our vicinity. Thii; ditliculty is diminished by the circumstanco that the great fluctuatio11s ol tlrn b:iron1ekr urn not rapitl, autl that the variations in the pressure of the atmosphero are extremely exteusi\·o. It will still, howe\·er, I apprehen1l, lw very difficult to distinguish between tho offects arising from ,·ariations in tlrn atu10sphorfo prei;sure, and those urii;ing immediately from the effect of wiud, as I have before remarked.·

Lubbock resumes this subject in the Trarnmctions for 1837, p. 97, and for 1838, p.103.t In a paper contained in the Transactions for 1837, Lubbock assigns the letters A, B, 0, D, E, F to the transits upper au<l lower in the order of their occurrence, F marking the one immediately preceding Londo11 high water. 112. JJr. William TV he well (1794-1806). Whewell wrote extensively on tides a111l thl'ir atten,lant pheuomeua. His most important papers on these sn~jects are contained i11 the Philosophical Transactions aud the reports of the British Association between the years 183~~ and 18;34 .. 'l'hey co11tain much information about tides all over the world. His discussions or reductions are generally along the lines laid down by Lubbock. He was the first to draw cotidul lines,t although Lubbo'.!k had already marked the cotidal hours upon two charts. He was at, the head of a movement to obtain simultaneous observations over as large a portion of the earth as possible. In 1834 he succeeded in obtaining a fortnight of such observations around the British Isles. But between June 8 and June 28, 1835, simultaneous observations were mad~ from LouiRiana to Nova Scotia and from tl1e Strait of Gibraltar to North Cape. The results are published on pages 308 to 341 of the '.I.'ransa'ctions for 1836. These observations were upon low as well as high water. Later, in the Transactions for 1847 and 1851, he strongly recommends a similar procedure for the Pacific Ocean. The simultaneous observations threw much light upon tlte form of cotidal lines, showing, among other tltiugs, that in general these Jines meet the shore at very acute angles. Several descriptive terms, not all of which have come into general use, are due to Whewell. Of these may be mentiouerl the following, tog-ether with the year of publication in which they first occur: Points of convergence, points of divergence, time of slack water vs. time of l1igh water, semimenstrual inequality, corrected c>stabli:-;hment, vulgar establishment, age of the tide (Phil. Trans., 1833); coeflicient of tlte semi menstrual iuequality (Phil. Trans., 1834); retropositiou, luuitidal interval, mean lunitidal (Phil. Trans., 1836); incidence [of diurnal inequality] (ll. A. A. S. Report, 1851 ). Whewell treats at some length tlte question of diurnal inequality. He points out the fact that tlrn age of this inequality may vary very rapidly from place to 1~lace and that it may be quite different from the age of the phase or parnllax i11equality. Hence no one age is common to all inequalities. The simultaneous observations of J u11e, 183.~, already alluded to, afforded a large variety of tides, and showe1l the prevalC'nce of this inequality on the eastern coa.=-t of America and the outer coast of Europe.

he considers the diurnal inequality dependent almost wholly upon the moou, arnl ;;o tl1e imn'" effect is not properly allowed for. Whewell describes (Phil. Trans., 1837) a graphic method for obtainiug the diurnal wa \"C. 'l'lte method is applicable ouly when its rauge is small in comparison with the mean range of title. It will be readily recognized as a forerunner of Pourtales's method. ""ith the times of the tides as abscissm, aud the iueqtialities in the individual high or low water heig·hts ns ordinates, poiuts a.re located through which a sinuous curve is passed by inspection. The hig-hwater inequality c1irYe properly combined with a similar one for the low waters gives the diurnal wave as it appears from day to day. 'fhe following are some of his conclusions in regard to the dinmal inequality:
The diurnal inocprnllty <lopontls upon tho moon being north or south of tl111 equator; its maximum co1TC8Jio11ds to (hut is not nece8sarily simultaneous with) the moon's greatest tleclinatiou; am! tho porio<l of its Yanishing corresponds in like mmmor with tho time of tlw moon passing t.lw e<[lrnt.or. Between perimls corresponding to two such pnssngoH, the inequality increases from 0 to a maximum, uucl decreases to 0 again; after which it again increase.-.· Tho different epoch [a.ge] of the diurnal i1rnqnality in ditferont parts of the world is a very curious fact; a.nd tho more so, since it is inconsistent with tho mode hitherto adopted of explaining the eir<'umstancos of the ti<les by conceiving a. ti<le-wave to tr:n-el to all shores in Hucccssion It would Hcem as if Urn tidal phenomena on this side of the Atlantic corresponded to an epoch (of the e<1nilibri11rn-theory) two or three clays Inter than "tho snmo llhcnomena in Amorica; n.ml wo may perhaps add, that different kinds of phenomena. do not appear to truvt·l at tho same rate. t Tho diurnal inequality [in time] is nlso very large in places where tho tide hns to run far inland, as in the l'omul of Christiania in Norway, and in tho Zuydor Zee in !-lolland.t \Ve caunot know, except h~· observation, to what transit of the moon any tide bclo1111·; hut it is manifest that if wo hegin with any tide, the tides must helong alternately to south and north transits, nncl therefore tho abo,·o alternation of greater and smaller tic!tis, a.s tho moon has north or Houth declinatie>n, must come into view.§ On the en.st coaHt of America., the changes of t.Jiis inequality appear to lw eont.emporaueous with the corresponding changes of the moon'H declination, u.nd tho epoch is ze1·0. On the coasts of Spain, Portugal, und France, it is fmccessirnl~· tH·o anti three days. And this is quite consistent with the fact that this epoch is four dn.~·s on tho <'oust of Cornwall and Devonshire, fire days at Bristol, six at Liverpool, and IH·cll"e at Leith.ii It is easy to conceive tho diurnal inoqua.lity carried n little further than it is at f'ingnporo; so that at a certain stage of it tho alternate ticles would vanish. This is ocp1h·alont to supposing tho highest low we.tor and tho lowest high wu.ter to have the same height. Thero are statement8 of rnwigators rospcctiug \'urions plu.ces ut which there is "only one tide in twenty-four l..1011rs." From what hn.H been saitl it appears tha.t thit1 rnay happen <luring n irnrt of 01ich somilunntion [hulf-tropicnl month] by tho otroct of tho ino<Jlrnlity now under couHitleratiou, bnt that it cannot in this way I.Jo l)onstantly tho case.fl !Tsing tho phrases which have predously boon employed on this suhjoct, tho epoch of tho.diurnal inequality is zero, and tho effect of the moon's declination reache8 l'etropaulofsk without an.1· dt1lay or retardation. But this view of tho Ja.ws of tho ticle>i at this placo, which might otlrnrwit1e he a.eceptecl without.· difficulty, is extremely perplexocl and intorforod with by tho other parts of the diurnal inoquality,-the ineqnulity of heights at .high water n.nd of times of low water. For though those ineqnalitios am not so large or so regular as the others, still they aro sufficiently marked and ste:idy to allow their laws to ho soon beyond doubt. And it appenrs, not only that tho epoch of these p1Lrts of the inequality does not agrt1ll with that of tho others, but tha.t these two inequ11lities altcr11ate with the other two, vanishing when tho other roach their maxima, and showing their maxima. when the others vanish. This is a. very 11erploxing circumsta.uco; for wo cannot don ht that tho diurnal inoqnnlity depends upon the moon's not moving in tho oqnator; and therefore, how this inequality should affect the height of high water and the time of low water most, at that l>oriod ut which the moon is in the ecJ1111tor, it is difficult to conceive.*' As I have f!hown in former memoirs, wo may represent the usual diurnal inecp1a.lity at any place as the effect of a tide waye arriving at tho shore once a day and superimposed upon the semidiurnul tide wave. \\'o n.re naturally lot! to n.sk whether such a mode of representation is npplicablo to the tides now under consideration. Tho features which the diurnal iuotprnlity exhibits a.+, Petropaulofsk nre not, for tho most purt, inconsistent with suoh a. reprosouta.tion. Thus, that tho inequality should u.tfect high water nnd low water very differently is easily oxpla.inecl.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

On page 84, Phil. Trans., 1837, Whewell reaches the important conclusion that the mean height of the sea (half-tide level), as determined by the four tides of a day, is nearly constant, even where the diurnal inequality is large; also that this plane is preferable to such a plane as mean low water or mean high water. ·
It appears that in all these cases the mean height of the sea. is very nearly constant. This is most remarkable at Singapore, where, though the successive low waters often differ by' six feet, the mean level only oscillates through a few inches. At Plymouth the mean level is not quite so steady. The fact is, that at tlmt port the low water varies more by the difference of springs and neaps than the high water doeH; and hence the mean level slightly follows the low water, and is lowest at spring tides, and highest at neap tides, or perhaps morti exactly a day or two later. "The level of the sea at low water," a phrase sometimes used by surveyors, is altogether erroneous, and may lead to material error. From the instances just quoted (and indeed from the nature of the case}it is certain that the mean height of the sea is far more nearly constant than low or high water, under whatever assumed conditions. A lei·el surface drawn from any point (that ia a surface of stag11a11t water) would probably be nearly parallel to the points of mean water at different places. This becomes more manifest when we consider that at places near each other the tide often differs greatly in amount. At. St. Davids Head in Pembrokeshire the range of the tides is near thirt.y feet; on the opposite coaat of Ireland it is only two or three: if the sea. were level ut low water the difference of the mean heights on the two sides of the Channel (which is only about fifty miles) would be fourteen feet. Such an average elevation of 9ne side of a narrow sea above the other is quite inconsistent with the law\! of fluids.*

In the Transactions for 1838, Whewell notes the eftect of taking various anterior transits; and, although be finds that Transit B does well for the coast of Europe, be says:
We may, however, obsen·e that we do uot in thi1:1 way obtain nu exact agr.,ernent of observation and thel'ry, even with regurcl to the semimenstrual inequality. It has appeared from ::\lr. Lubbock's researches respecting the Liverpool tides, t that while the Transit A gives aver~· exact agreement of the theoretical anll observed times, we must take a 1:1till earlier transit if we would obtain thi1:1 agreement with respect to the heights. Nor docs that selection of a tranait which best represents the semirncnstrual inequality, briug out an agreemeut wi~h theory in the parallax and declination corrections, as we shall see. \Ye must allow, therefore, that though there appear to be, in the actual laws of tho tides, inequalities correspo11ding to all these which arise from the supposition of the equilibrium-tide of nn anterior epoch transmitted along the ocean to our shores, we cannot so assume the epochs to produce all the inequaliticR at once. Tht· epoch is of one value for the times, of another for the heights; different again for the parallax correction, and ugain different for the effect of declination.

In the second volume of his History of the Inductive Sciences, Whewell gives a section on the application of the Newtouiau theory to the tides,t and earliflr in the same volume some account of the equilibrium and motion of fluids.§ , In the Philosophical Tram1actions for l 850, Whewell notices a graphic method for obtaining the range of tide corresponding to each hour of the moon's transit. A triangle having two of its sides proportional to the ranges of the solar II and lunar,-r waves, respectively, and the supplement of the enclosed angle twice the difference in right ascension of sun and moon as given by the hour of transit, the remaining side of the triangle is proportional to the resultaut range of tide. This metlwd is given in the i\Ianual of Scientific Enquiry, together with the angles showing the priming and lagging of the resultant tide. 'fhe later writings of Whewell place little confidence in cotidal lines except near the shores. The B. A. A. 8. Report for 1854, II, page 28, says:
The result is that we are led to consillcr whether the oceanic t.ides may not be produced by a great oscillation of the Ol'ean, tlrn lit.toral 1.ides being derived from them and propagated by cotidal lines like wuves along canals. [This view was proposed by Captain Fitz Roy as well as Dr. Whewell several years ago.]

It may be added that Dr. Young bad already held a similar view regarding the oscillation of the ocean. In fact a bodily swinging df the ocean is in accordance with the views of' Plato, Galileo, aud others. 113. In.the appendix to Volume II of the Narration of the Surveying Voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle, between 1826 and 1836, Oapt. Robert Fitz Roy has set down general notions about the tides, and be bas employed them to help explain what is observed in diverse places.

He believes the tides to be largely due to the swinging of a sea when slightly displaced from its position of equilibrium, the primary causes of such displacement being the sun and moon acting in accordance with Newton's law. This theory naturally opposes tlie idea that the principal part of the .Atlantic tide progresses northward along the axis of the ocean; for, the swinging of the sea due to the diurnal motions of the sun and moon must be chiefly east-and-west and not north-and-south. Observation, Ile notPs, ishows the range of tide at Ascension and St. Helena islands, as well as at mani places upon the shon's, to be a very small quantity; again, the tide is almost simultaneonis all aloug the coast from the Cape of Good Hope to thB Congo. These facts render very difficult the conception of n. great and sufficient tide wave progressing 11orthw~rd in accordance with tlie cotidal li11es of Whewell. Prof. J. Challi.~ has written numerous papers ou hydrodynamics, most of which are to be found in the Philosophical .:\laga:d11e since 1851; a "Report on the present state of the analytical theory of hydrostatics and hydrodynamics" is given in the British Association Report for 1833. His papers on tidal theory are found in th6 Philosophical Magazine for the years 1870 and 1875. The principal writings of Sir John Scott Russell are contained iu the British Association Reports from 1834to1850. They relate mainly to hydrodyuamical experiments and applications of the same to marine engineering. lie became popularly known through the part he played in the con!'truction of the steamship Great Eastern. The results of his experiments on waves are contained in the Heports for 1837 and 1844. Ee classifies waves in the following manner, but deals mostly with the "wave of translation:"

One of his most impor1 ant results is that the velocity of the ''wave of translation," which he supposes to include the tide wave, is where 17 is the height of the crest of the wave, reckoned from the surface of the undisturbed fluid, and h is the undisturbed depth; i. e., It+ 17 is the height of the free surface above the bottom, aud so this formula is readily suggested by that of Lagrange. Airy's work makes, for high-water phase,
(266)

In Articles 393 et seq. of his Tides and Waves he compares values resulting from this and other formula with Hussell's experiments and concludes this value of v to be justified. In the Heport for 1844 Russell does not accept Airy's statement, but sa.ys:
Later discussions of the experiments not only confirm this result [ v= (ll.+1,1)], but are ihemselves esta.b. lishcd by such further experiments us have been recently institntC<I, so thnt this formerly obtained velocity may now he regar<led us the phwnomenon characteristic of the wave of the first order.

Russel's result has reference to a "solitary wave," while Airy's refers to a long wave 'which is p_eriodic. See Hayleigh, Phil. Mag., Vol. 1 (1876), p. 262.

Airy's work on tides consists chiefly of an e8say entitled Tides and Waves (c. 1842), forming an article in the Encyclop:cdia l\letropolitana, of four papers on particular tides, appeari11g in the Philosophical Transaction8 (1842, 1813, 1845, 1Si8), and one in the Proceeuings of the Hoyal Society (1877). To these may be added a paper entitled "On a controverted point in Laplace's theory of the tides" (Phil. Mag., 1875).

115. Passing over the first three sections, wherein be has given the equilibrium theory in a form subsequently used by Haughton and others, also the principal parts of Laplace's theory in a more intPlligible form, we proceed at once to Section IV, which deals mostly with waves in canals:
\Vo hum already stated that tho E<p1ilibrium-Thoory of Tides, though curious in its relation to tho history of tho science, and valuable for tho coincidence of tho algebraic form of its rcsnlts (under certain modifications) with those of moro accurate theories, and with tho laws deduced from ohsorvati1ms, docs not deserve tho smallest attention as representing tho state of tho 01·can at any time. \Ye have also statetl that Laplace's theory of the movement of tho sea, supposing tho globe completely covore<l l·y water, whoso depth ·is uniform, or follows a very simple geographical law, though based upon sounder principles, has fur too little regard tot.he actual state of tho earth to serve for tho explanation or tire J>rincipal phrunomona of tides. \Ve now come to a third tlu.·ory: that of tho motion of tho ticlal waters, supposing them to run in tho manner of ordinar;r waves in canals. 1t is o\'idont that this theory will not apply to every part of tho sea, and therefore it must, to a cert:iin extent, he considered imperfect, Still it will apply strictly to many cases (to rivers without exception; ancl to arms of tho sea where their breadth is smaller than their length, and where tho irregnla.rities of the coasts are not very remarkable), and it will apply without sensible moclifica.tion to other cases of open sonA, where the whole muy he conceived divided into parallel canals in which tho circumstancos are nearly similar. For these reasons wo are inclined to think that tins moclo of cons11lering tho subject, in the present imperfection of mathematics, deserves special notice among tho various Theories of tho Tides. It is necessary for our present purpose to enter into a pretty general investigation of th11 Theory of Wa\·es of water; and we shall therefore commence without any obvious rHfercuco to tho subject of Tides. \Vo shall, for convenience, divide this Section into tho following parts: Subsection 1.-General explauation of waves; and general theory of wa,·os, MnppoMing the motion of the particles small. Subsection 2.-Thoory of waves in cuuuls of uniform clepth and uniform broadt\1, whether the waves ue Hhort or long, tho motion of the particles being supposed small.

llG. Having obtained the equation of continuity and the equation of equal pressure, Airy next supposes the motion to be oscillatory and proposes the problemTo exuminB whether it is possible that a system of waves, depending upon oscillatory motion of the particle~ of witter, can movn along a canal of uniform breadth, but of variable depth: gravity being supposed uniform, and no other force being supposed to act.*

His conclusion isIt wonl<l appear, tlwrefore, that when the depth is variable, it ill impossible that there can boa series of waves

which consist of oscillatory motion of the particles, and whi<"h satisfy the two equations of continuity and of equal pressure. The following physical interpretation of this mathematical result appears to be correct, and is worthy of attention. It appears that, if the water is moving in the mnnn'er of waves, one at lenst of the two conditions (continuity and equal pressure) must fail. While the continnity holds, the eqnnl proHsure will exist, from the nature of tho fluid. Therefore the continuity must ceuse, or tho water rnnst become broke11, ThiM appears to bo the oxplanation of the broken water which is usually seen upon the edge of a shoal or n. lodge of rocks, although the whole is eoyertl<l, porhn.ps deeply, by the water.

Ile then takes up the case of a canal of uniform depth, and determines the fundamental relation feq ui valen t to equation (29) § 18, or (42) § !,!;~ j between the length of the wave, depth of water, and its period. These are tabulated in his first two tables; t his third table gives the \'elocity of a free title-wave for various depths. His fourth table gives the relative displacements of the fluid particles at various depths, the length of the wave having a given ratio to the depth of the fluid. 117. In Subsection 3, Airy proposes the problemTo in\·est.i~ate the motion of a very long waYe, us tho tide-wave, in a canal whose <lepth is so smn.11 that the range of elt,vation nnd depression of the Hurf'aco bears a considerable proportion to tho whole depth.

The i)roblem of a long wave propagated in a canal of rectangular cross-section was originally solved (to the first approximation) l>y Lagranp;e;t that is, the velocity of propagation was found t.o be ../ gh, h being the depth of the undisturbed flnid. The long wave was subsequently treated by Green,§ who found for a triangular canal with one side vertical, the velocity of propagation to be the same as that in a rectangular canal of half the depth. Kelland ii found, for a uniform canal of any cross section whatever, the velocity of Jlropagation to be

double the argument of the original term. Moreover, a coefficient belonging to one of these additional, or harmonic, terms does in each case involve the factor x. He therefore concludes that the height of the secondary wave continually increases as it travels along the canal. Again, be says:
When tho wave loaves tho open sea., its front slope and its rear slope are equal in length, and similar in form. But as it advances in the cane.I, its front slope becomes short and steep, aml its rear slope becomes long and gt·ntlo. In advancing still further, t.his remarkable change takes place in the rear slope: it is not so steep in the mid<lle as in the upper and the lower parts; at length it becomes horizontal at the middle; and, finally, slopes the opposite way, forming in fact two waves.·

As McOowau t has pointed out, this tendency to subdivide does not follow from an exact solution of the above equation, but from applying Airy's approximation to stations situated so far from the sea that it ceases to be applicable. Airy finds that in a shallow canal the duration of fall should exceed the duration of rise:
Excess of the time of water falling above tho time of water rising= 6 b X time occupied by the tide-wave in passing from the open sea to the station under consideration. Where b= rise of tide abo¥e the mean state. mean depth of water
(268)

Thus in any part of the canal far from the sea, the times of high water and of low water, and the interval between them, will on different days depend on the extent through which the surface of the water oscillates up and down, or upon the magnitude of the whole rise of tide. And in places on the canal at different distances from the sea, the inequality of the times of water rising and water falling will, ou the same day, clepcncl upon the di11tance of the places from the sca.t . . . . . . Therefore the phase of high water has travelled along the canal with the velocity ..· Vyli"(I+3b) nearly. The velocity with which a shallow wave of great Iongth would travel along the surface of water, whose depth= depth here at high water, would, by (172.),§ be V ux depth at bigli\vater;:;; V uxh (l+b). Consef!uently, tho phatie of high water travels along the canal with a velocity greater than that of a shallow wave on water of the Ramo depth as the high water. In like_ manner, the phase of low water travel11 along the canal with the velocit,\' y(gh(l-3b)] nearly, which is less than that of a. long shallow wave on water of tho same depth as the low water. The following theorem will be easily remembered. If D, be the depth at low water, D 3 that at high water, nnd if D 1, D,, D 3 , D,, are in arithmetical progression; then the pha8e of low water travels with the velocity duo to t!Je depth Di, and tho phase of high water with the velocity due to the depth D.,11

After showing that the ebb-stream should be swifter than the flood-stream, and also giving a solution to the third approximation, be takes up the problemTo investigate the motion of the tide-wave under tho samo circumstances, when the water of the canal is supposed also to have a current.-flow (independent of fluctuations of tido) to"'ards the sea.

He finds that the duration of fall exceeds the duration of rise by a quantity greater than in the ease of no current. The subsection concludes with an investigation for long waves in a canal whose section is invariable, but of any form, and here the velocity of propagation is found to agree with the rules of Kelland and Green. 118. Subsection 4 suppoties the water acted upon by an extraneous force and has applications to a solitary wave, tides, and wind waves.
Thus it appears, that a single discontinuous wave of any degree of complexity may travel on water without any force to maintain it, provided, in the first placo, that it satisfies the conditions laid down with regard to the differential coefficients at its t.erminations, and in tho next place, that the wave is so long that a succession of simple waves, each of that length, would travel sensibly with the velocity clue to waves of infinite lcngth.1[ If the single wave is moderately long, a small force will maintain it as a discontinuous wave: but if it be short, the force must be (in proportion to the various preBBures acting on tho water) considerable. In fact, each of t.he different tonne in the wave-function represents a wave of different length; and, when the wa¥es arc short, each of these would tend to tra¥el on with its own peculiar velocity, which velocities a.re very different for the different waves. But when *be waves aro long, the peculiar velocities are very nearly the same for tho different waves. "Tides and Waves, Art. 203. The tides at Wilmington, N. C., show signs of this. t Phil.

When a long wave is propagated along a canal of non-uniform depth, Airy's investigations show that the amplitude of the horizontal displacement varies inversely as the fourth root of the cube of the depth, while the amplitude of the vertical displacement (i. e., the rise and fall of the tide) varies inversely as the fourth root of the depth.· For a canal of non-uniform breadth, the amplitudes of the horizontal displacement will be inversely as the square root of the breadth of the canal; and the same law holds for the amplitude of the vertical displacement.t
In tho cnso of long wavos in shallow wn.ter, where the dopth diminishos, tho wator is sensibly elovn.ted abovo its mon.n height whou the flow con.sos; and in like manner it is sensibly dopressed below its mean height when tho obb ceases.i

I. e., slack-before-ebb or flood occurs earlier because of this shoaling.
"\Vhero the breadth diminishes, tho water is sensibly elevated above its mean height when tho flow ceases; and in like mn.nner, the wator is sonsibly depressed holow its mean hoight whon the obb ceases.

I. e., slack-before-ebb or flood occurs earlier because of this contracting.

H and G being the amplitudes, or coefficients, of the horizontal and vertical periodic forces acting upon the waters, he finds the following result agreeing with the equilibrium theory as well as with Laplace's theory:
If we cousider G and H to bo quantities not very. dissimilar in magnitudo, (which we shall find to bo true,) the term depending on Gin each of these expressions is wholly insignificant in comparh;on with that depending on H; and thus we arrive at this romarknble conclusion, that the effect of the vertical disturbing force upOll the phamonwna of thtJ tides i11 insignificant, tho whole of tho sensiblo effect being duo to the horizontal force.§

Near the end of this subsection he says:
The preceding conclusions aro vory important, as showing that the amount of elevation of the water under tho action of forces depends in a most remarkable clegroe upon other circumstances than the magnitude of the forces. Ono is, the depth of tho sea: another is, tho periodic time of the forcos. As depending upon the former, it appears that, if thero were two parallel canals of different depths acted on by procisely the same forces, there might be high water in one when there was low water in th(l adjacent part of tho othor: or there might be elevations and depressions at the same time in lioth, but their magnitudes might havo any proportion whatever. As dopending upon the latter, it appears that, if thore wore two forcos acting simultaneously upon the water in the samo canal, the poriocls of those forces being different, (as, for instance, tho forces depending upon the action of the Sun and the Moon,) the high water produced by one force might bear t.he same relation to the phases of that force which the low water produced by the other bears to the phases of that other force: (thus low water of the solar tide might accompany tho transit of the Sun, and high wator of the lunar tide might accompany the transit of tho Moon, iu the same canal.) Or the phases of the two tides might staud in the same relation to the iihases of the two forces, but tho proportion of their magnitudos to the magnitudes of tho forces might differ in any dogree whatevor.

119. Ju subsecti_on 5, Airy investigates the tides produced by the moon in a. canal, friction being still left out of consideration. He finds, for a canal bounded at both ends,If the length of the canal is any multiple of half the length of the free tide-wave, this oxpreseion II beoomos
infinite. In roality the wave will become so large that tho amount of friction, &o., will be so groat as to neutralize the moon's force.1[

But when such a canal is short he concludes from the expressions for the horizontal and vertical displacementsTho first of thoso expressions shows that tho horizontal motion will be groatest in tho middle of the canal's longth, and will diminish gradually both ways to tho ouds, whero it is 0. The second shows that there is no variation of level at the middle of the canal's length, but that the variation of level in other parts is 'proportional to the distance from the middle, elevation taking pince on one aide of tho.middlo nt the same time as depression on the other side, so that the surfaco of the fluid remains sensibly plane, though inclined to the horizon. The law of motion as regards tho time ill the usual oscillat.ory law exprossecl by cos ii; but the motion of every particle differs in this respect from tho motion' of particles in au open sea alfocted by tho tide: that here, tho greatest horizontal dillplacement happens at the same time as the greatest vortical displacemont; whereas, in an open sea, the greatest horizontal displacement happens when the vertical displacement is O, and vice t·ersa.

For a canal of any assumed length, and bounded at both ends, the expressions for the displacements are generally complicated.

Airy next supposes the case of a canal closed at one end whose waters are acted on by the forces of the moon and which communicates with a tidal sea. The result of this supposition is complicated; but if the moon's force in the canal is insensible, it follows tliat all the oscillations in different parts of the canal take place at the same time.* Wher. the elevation of the water bears a sensible proportion to the whole depth he finds for a canal opening at one end int~ a tidal seaThc law of the rise arnl fall of the water, at every part of the canal except its month, is now different from that which holds on the supposition that the oscillation ii; small in proportion to the depth of the canal. But the times of high water and of low water are ~till the same as before, and the high water and the low water are still simultaneous through the wholo length of the canal.I

120. In subsection

Brief me~1tion is then made of a canal co11necting two seas, both tided, or oue may be tideless. (i friction is taken into account; it is assumed to be proportional to the

velocity of the fluid partieles, or -!~ft, since the motion is chiefly horizontal.
In an indefinite canal, friction shortens the horizontal displacement; it causes the horizontal disturbing force to become zero at a point farther east, and so accelerates the times of the tides. Tides of longer period are more accelerated. Considering the coefficients of the tidal force as variable, it appears that the greatest tide follows the greatest force by the time f x (cons'tant) 2 · He says:
This appears to us an important result, and one which no other theory has obtained. The oquilihrinm-thoory of tides necessarily makes the tillcs to be greatest upon tile same d:iy on which the force is greatest. Laplace's theory, and the tlleory of waves in eanalt1 without friction, give the same r"sult. But hero we find n rotar<lutioo aceountod for by friction; and moreover this retardation is consi<lornble.t

For a tide propagated np a river of indefinite length, he finds that, because of friction, the vertical and hol'izontal motions of the particles diminish continually as the waYe travels up the river; also that the flow ceases before the water has dropped to its mean height, and 1w turns earlier than iu the case of 110 friction. In a tidal river stopped by a barrier, he finds that the slack before ebb is not simultaneous with the time of high water, but somewhat later. 'l'his interval may be considerable near the mouth, but it is small near the head.§ Also that when a canal bounded at both ends is acted upon by an external force, the rise and fall of the tide is greater at the ends than at the middle. In regard to a river of indefinite length running on a declivity toward a tidal sea, he concludes thatThe circnmstanc" that low water on a ti<lal river may be higher than high water on tile sea, paradoxical us it may appear, it1 therefore a simple consequence of theory.

121. Snbsection 7 contemplates the motion of water in three dimem;ions. The equation of continuity is symmetrical in X, x and z, z; there are two equations of equal pressure, the one in X, x; the other is similar in Z, z. He finds solutions for annular and parallel waves, noting the effect of retlection from a straight boundary.
Leaving for the present the consideration of th1i motion of the waves as <letermine<l by the differential equations, we 11hall consider on~ caHc in which wo 1.<com to derive some assiHtanre from general reasoning. Suppose that n ti<le-wave is travelling along n canal of largo dimensions, and of variable depth in its cross section, the depth diminishing gradually to both shores. (We may supposti the dimensions to he such ae those of the English Cllanuel, or any Himilar arm of the sea.) It is evident that the investigation of (218.) II does not npply here: for, on account of the Hhallowness of the water at the side~, the velocity of flow towards both sides to produce the elevation of water there must be comparable with, perhaps equal to, the ,·elocity of flow at mid-channel in tile ·Cf. § 30, Part I, thiA manual. t Tides and Waves, .A rt. 309. t Titles and Waves, Art. 329. §In the Philosophical Magazine, Vol. 12 (1856), pp. 18'1-188, C.

direction of the canal'i; lcngtlt. :Moreover, as the Alope of the bottom is exceedingly small, the warns in cvt>ry part of the channel will be travelling in nearly tlte same manner as if the extent of ;;ea of t110 sanw depth were infinitely great, and will therefore travel witlt the velocity line to that depth: and, thcreforP, the ridge of wave cannot possibly stretch tran8versely to the channel, and travel along with uniform velocit.y lengthwa~·s of the channel. The state of things, then, will be this: the central part oft.he wave will advance rapidly (171.) aloug the middle of the channul; the lateral parts will not advance ;;o rapiclly; and th11 whole rht<Je will assume a curved shape, its convex side prece!liug. "'hen this form is once acquired, it may perhaps proceed with little alteration; for if . we suppose two such curves exactly similar, but one a little iu advance of tlie other, the space which separates the wings of the two curvus, measured perpendicularly to the curves, (the direction in which that part of tlw \VIWll must really travel,) iA much lesA than the »pace which separates the centres oft.he curves, and by proper inclination may be less in auy proportion; and, therefore, may represent exactly tho space travelled ovPr b~· the wave at tbat depth while the wave at the greater depth traveli; ovor the greater space. That part of the ritlge of the wave which is uearest to tho coast will, theroforo, assume a poRition uoarly parallel to the line of coast. Now the wave whose ridge is nearly parallel to the coast, or which advances aimost directly towards the coast, will be a wa\'e of the samo character as that treatell of in (307. ). For the slope of tho beach adds to the surface of the sea a very insignificant quantity, as compared with the brca!lth of the tide-wave, and the general effect is tho same as if a perpemlicular diff terminated the sea on that side. Therefore, for those parts of the sea which are near to the coasts the law of (307.) holds; namely, the greatest horizontal displacement of the particles occurs at the same time as the greatest vertical displacement; and, therefore, when the sea is rising, the water is, for some distance from tho co1ist, flowing towards the coaAt., and when it is falling, the water is flowing from the coast. In mi<l-channcl, tho motion of the water will be such as is dcscri bed in (184. ), &c.; that is, the water will be llowing most rapidly up the channel at thr, time of high water, and its motion upwards will cease when tho water has clrop}led to its mean height. From this them follows u curious consequence with regard to the currents at an intermediate distance from the shore, where the effects of these two motions may be conceived to he combined. At high water the water is not 11owing to or from the shore, but is flowing up the channel. Whon the water hua <lroppe!l to its mo!\n elevation, the water iH ebbing from the shore, but is stationary with regard to motion up or down the channel. At low watPr, the wakr is not flowing to 01' from the shore, but is running down the channel. When the water bas risen to its mean height, the water is flowing to the shore, but is stationary with regard to motion up or clown the channel. ConHcquently, in the course of one complete tide, the direction of the current will have changed through 3600, the water never having been stationary. And the direction of tlui change of cnrrent will bn of 1mch u kiu!l that, if we suppose ourselves sailing 1111 the mid-channel, the tide-current will turn, in those parts which are on the left hancl, in the Bame direction aa the hands of a watch; and in those parts which are on the right hand, in the <lirectiou oppoBite to that of the handH of a watch.· lleyoncl this we can add little to the Theory of "'aves upon a sea externled in both dimensions. Bnt the following remarks will be found important with refornnco to the methou of determining from observations some of the phenomcua of titles: In tracing the progress of the tide across an externletl sea, we cannot observe the different waves as w·~ <'IUJ those upoh a small piece of water. \Ve cu.n do uothing but mu.Im observations of the time of the rise and fall of the .ieu at many clifferent poiut.11 along the shores of the bonnding contiuonts, or at. islauds in different parts of the sea: and when we lmve thni; ascertained tho absolute time of high water ut many clitforent lloints, if tho>· are Rnflicicutly 11n1twrous, we ma,v draw lines ovor the surface of tho sen passing through all the poiuts nt whi!'h high wntt>r takl's 11laco ut the same :thsolnte instant. Those lines (adopting the wonl introduced int.o general use by the highest authority on the discussion of tide-observations) we shall call cotidal lines. The tracing ont the coticlal lines in different aeas is the greatest advance that has yet been made in 1'1l<I discussion of t.hu phe11omcrn1 of the tidl's in opeu seas. Now when the series of waYcs is siugle, the cot itlal lines cone~poml exactly with the lines markiug the position of thu ridge of tho wave at <lifferent times. Bnt when t.he series of \\'In-cs is compo111ul, it: ma~- happen tliat the form of tlw coticlnl liuos will not llrt·sent to the oye the Rmallest analogy with the forum of the ridges of the mingle<l waves.I

The fifth section of the essay is devoted to an acconut of experiments 011 waves aud to comparisons with theory. Ile finds a geueral agreement between the theoretical and observed velocity of propagation, but attributes the want of close agreement to the fact tlrnt l\lr. Russell neglected to observe tlle length of the waves in his experiments. 122. In the sixth section he applies Laplace's eqnations of mot.ion to tides in narrow canals. In these cases it is unnecessary to consider the forces arising· from tl1e earth's rotation. The problem thus simplified admits of solutions which take into aeconut the motion in right ascension of the tidal bo.dy. 'fhe cases especially considered are a canal along a parallel of latitude, and a grea.t circle iu any position. For an equatorial canal, tlie tide is equal throughout its whole extent, and

the depth will decide whether high water or low water occurs under the moon.· For a canal passing through the poles the tide wave is a stationary wave. In considering the effect of' sun and moon he concludes:
1st. If the de1ith of the sea is less than 14 miles, the mass of the moon inferred from the tides is inevitably too great. 2d. The error. will be different (or the moon's mass will appear different) in canals of different depths. I

Having introduced the effect of' friction, he says:
Thus it appears that for computing the time of high water it is necessary to use, not the positions of the sun and moon at the true time of the tide, nor the positions at that anterior time which is employed in computing the height of high water, but a time later than that which is used for computing the height, and therefore a time which is nearer to the true time of high water. . . . . . . If we investigated the effect of the passage up tho shallow river upon the time of low water, we should find that tho positions of tbe snn and moon corresponding to an earlier time than that used for the height of the high water must bo employed; but we should still find that the mass of tho moon inferred from tho variations of the time of low water as referred to the moon's transit 1s too small. "'o shall here close our exposition of the \Vave-Theory as applied to the tides. As nearly the whole of this theory is published for tho first time in the present treatise, we shall not remark upon it at great length. We think it right, however, to point out to the reader its great and important defect as applied to the explanation of tides upon the earth, namely, that in the case of nature tho water is not distributed over the surface of the globe in canals of uniform breadth and dept11, or in any form very nearly resembling them. In this regard its fundam1mtal suppositions are probably as much, or nearly as much, in error as those of Laplace's theory. But we also think it right to point out that in regard to tho completeness of detail with which the principles can be followed out, there is no comparison between the two theories. This will be seen by the reader who has remarked the facility with which tbe results of" difference between the angular velocities of the sun and moon,"" variable coefficients of force," and "friction," a.re obtained in finite form. For these, Laplace's theory is quite useless. And though (as we have stated) the fundamental suppositions differ much from the real state of the seas, yet no one can hesitate to admit that the same general conclusions will apply :-for instance, that the moon's mass inferred from the height of the tides is too great, and by different degrees in different. places: that the effect of friction will be a retroposition of tides in reference to the places of the sun and moon, &c. The peculiarities of river-tides, which no other theory has touched upon, are almost completely mastered by this.

123. In the seventh section is described Bunt's self-registering tide gauge; the methods of discussion adopted by Laplace, Lubbock, and Whewell; but of special interest is his description of' a process of' harmonic analysis which he had already applied to the tide curves at Deptford, t and which be is about to apply to the tide curves at Southampton and Ipswich.§ In brief, he expresses the depression of the surface of the sea below a :fixed mark for any given phase of the tide in the form
Ao+ Ai cos. phase+ A 2 cos. 2 phaso + &c., + B, sin. phase+ B, sin. 2 phase+ &c., which, it is well known, is sufficient for the ro11resentation of a. function which is periodical for 3600 of phase.

Then follow directions for determining the A's and B's. 124. In Section VIII Airy brings the tidal theories (equilibrium, Laplace's, and wave theories) to bear upon many questions connected with tides the nature of which are indicated by the following topics: Variation in range and shape of the tide as it progresses; the bore; tides in small seas; revolution of tidal currents; races; mean level of the sea little affected by the range of tide; the ratio of the solar to the lunar wave (coefficient of semimenstrual inequality) varies from place to place, and also depends upon whether it is obtained from heights or from times; similarly for the age of' this inequality; the necessity of using different transits for different inequalities; the diurnal tide; and cotidal lines. The essay concludes with a statement of the present desiderata in the theory and observation of tides. 125. In the Philosophical Transa.ctions for 1845 Airy makes a study of' the tide at about twenty stations scattered around the coast of Ireland. He ascertains the timeR when the high and low water inequalites become zero and when a

maximum. Ile is the first writer to make special use of the diurnal wave at the time of its maximum amplitude. Its amplitude, and position with respect to the sernitliurual wave are found from the height inequalities.· He shows that the diurnal and semidiurnal waves do not travel alike either in direction or in velocity.
The high water at Kingstown coincides 1n·eciBely with the low water at Dunmore East, and l'icc versa. Moreover, between theHe two Htations occurs the station Courtown; aud here . . . the semidiurnal tide is nearly insensible. The difforence in the times at Dunmore East and Kingstown does not therefore arise from a slow transmission of tide; but arises from a s11ddeu iuverBio11 of the wavo, the point which separates elevation from depression being not far from Courtowu. And the question now it1, whether, 011 t.he supposition that the tide-wave enters the Irish Sea by this southern entrance, it is possible to explain the existence of this neutral point and the invcrsiou of the tide beyond it.

This he believes may be explained by a result established in "Tides and Waves," where a uniform canal closed at one end communicates with a tidal sea; and \Vhich is, that the oscillation is simultaneous throughout the canal. In case of the Irish Sea representing such a canal, the open end is to the south and the closed end to the north; and if the depth be such that the coefficient (amplitude) of the simultaneous oscillation have opposite signs at Kingstown and Dunmore East, the phenomenon is, in a general way, explained. (See§ 30, this manual.) He has some further discussion upon the coefficient and age of the semimenstrual inequality as determined from time and height. He determines the coefficients of each individual tide at the various stations, the period covered being two months.t Having discussed the tides at Courtown, be says:
Both the semicliurnal tides ure very much diminished, the lunar so much that its ra.nge is rather less than that of the solar tide. The quarto-diurnal tide exists in nearly its greatest magnitude. The geometrical representation is perfect; the mechanical explanation is not complete. In both respects, as regards what is reduced to law and what is yet incomplete, the Courtown tides lllUBt be regarded as the most remarkable that have ever been examined.

Be is inclined to believe that the tertio-diurnal tide is not sensible on the coast of Ireland . .A.t tl10 close of his discussion of the tides at Malta (Phil. Trans., 1878), .Airy gives some account of the seiches as observed at that place. 126. Among the Matliematical and Physical Papers (1880) of Prof. G. G. Stokes several relate to the subject of wave motion. He treats the "long wave" in the paper entitled "Recent researches in liydrodynamics" (B. .A.. A. S. Ueport, 1846), and in the one entitled "Notes on hydrodynamics. IV-On Waves" (Camb. and Dub. Math. Jour., 1849). .A.iry's work upon tides in canals and certain of Russell's experiments are considered in this connection. Besides these may be mentioned a third paper entitled "On the theory of oscillating waves" (Trans. Camb. Phil. Soc., 1847). Capt. I?. W. Beechey, Phil. Trans., 1848, discusses the tidal currents in the Irish Sea and English Channel. Be draws upon a series of maps lines indicating the direction of the current (lines of flow) at stated liours and lines of equal range, the moon being new or full. Upon a chart of the Irish Sea showing "the set and rate of the flood stream" be has indicated a region of no current, which is caused by the meeting of the waters from north and south. Upon the chart of ranges of tide, the range nearly vanishes at Co1utown while on the opposite coast. of Wales it is 15 or 16 feet. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1851 he gives charts of the Eng·Iish Channel showing the lines of flow for each hour before and after high water at Dover. 'l'hese charts have been copied in several publications. Quite recently (1891) M. Hedouin of the Service hydrographique de la marine bas designed similar charts for this region, the currents being referred to the tides at Cberbourg.

127. Prof. Ale.rander D. Bache (1806-1867). As Superintendent of the Coast Survey, Bache caused many tidal observations to be made all along the coasts of the United States. He also gave his personal attention to the discussion of the observations; all(l among those who assisted in this work were J,. F. Pourtales, L. vV. l\Ieech, Henry l\Iitchell, Charles A. Schott, and R. S. A very. His writiugs on tides are contained in the Coast Survey Reports (1851-1806) and in the Proceedings of the American Association (1850-1857). As shown by these writings, the chief purpose of his work was the construction of cotidal li11es and the obtaining of suitable elements for prediction of tides. This implied, besides many aud extended observations, suitable modes of classification according to proper astronomieal arguments. The principal numerical results are given in the Reports (1833-1804) under the title "Tide tables for the use of navigators," the most complete of these tables being found in t!'ie Ifoport for 1864, pp. 58-flO. The constants given for nearly all except Gulf stations are: Mean high-water iuterval, extreme phase inequality in time, mean range of tide, spring range, neap range, duration of rise, of fall, and of stand. For the Gulf stations the constants are: The average range, the range at greatest declination and at zero declination. For numerous stations the phase inequality is tabulated according to the single argument-the time of the moon's transit. For several Pacilic stations tables of double argument are provided-the time of the moon's transit and the number of days from her extreme decliuation. Tables of single argument-the number of days from gTeatest deeHnation-are also giYen. 'fhe double-argument table must give predictions superior to those given by means of two tables of single argument successively applied., And so it seems that the pretlictions for the Paci lie Coast issued by the Survey for the years 18u7-1870, should, on this account, be more accurate than the predictions for the years 1871-188-l where single-argument tables were used, in accordance with Avery's paper published in the Heport for 1868 and entitled Wi\fode of forming a brief tide table for a chart." In fact, if a series of such double-argument tables were prepared for the different years or portions of the node-equinox period, the resnlti11g predictions must accord W!'ll witl1 the tides in nature, especially if the heights are corrected for parallax, Bache contemplated corrections for "the solar and lunar parallax and declination," hut they were uever extensively introduced into the computed predictions of the Coast Survey tide tables. The work of 11Ieech was largely directed along this line which had already been opened up by Bernoulli, Laplace, Lubbock, Whewell, and Airy. Some account of his work is given in the Proceedings of the American Association, 1850, I, pp. 160-170, and in the Coast Survey Heport, 1856, pp. 249-351. An obvious fault of his treatment, where the diurnal ine<1uality is large, is the neglecting of the motion of tlie moon's node. Bache paid considerable aLteution to the diurnal inequality along the Pacific coast." His manner of treatment was essentially that of Lubbock and Whewell, and he shows in the report for 1854 that even where the diurnal inequality is large, the height inequalities are nearly proportional to the sine of twice the moon's declination. For the Gulf tides, Bai;he c:onstrncted two sets of cotidal lines, one for the semi<liurnal tide, and one for the diurnal at the times of cxtre111t; declination. In the report for 1850, p. 2ii4 and sketch 35, he shows the semiannual variation of the lunitidal interval of the diurnal wave at extreme declination. 'fhis variation he finds to accord in a general way with that given by a formula of Airy'st for the displacement of the lunar diurnal tide by the solar. In fact the variation is zero at the equinoxes and solstices, the interval being longest in February and August. Rut he infers that extreme variation differs greatly for difforent places. 'l'his conclusion is doubtless based upon too few determinations. In fact the variation in interval is nearly :tlike in amount the world over, or at least wherever the age of the diurnal inequality is small. It is simply the perturbation in the K 1 O, wave, at the time when K 1 and 0 1 conspire, due to P 1, or it is very nearly the perturbation in K 1 due to P 1 (Table 31) multiplied by Ki/(K1 + 0 1). This gives the extreme variation for mean years as about± 4Grn. In the same report Bache notic~es the important fact tliat for several days at tlie time of

111aximum diurnal tides, the lunitidal interval of the diurnal wave varies slowly, but that it varies r<1pidly from day to day as the moon approaches the equator. This is shown by a diagram on "Sketch 35.'' In a general way, this accords with a remark made iu § 13, Part III, or with results obtainablf' from Table 27. In the Survey Hcport for 1857, also in the Proceedings of the American Association for the same year, Bache shows, by aid of diagrams, the effects which the three great bays of the .Atlantic coasts of the United States have upon tlle range of tide; also how the range of tide increases iu passing up the Bay of Fundy. In tlle reports for 1856 and 1858 he discusses the tidal currents near Sandy Hook and their effect upon the growth of tl!e hook. His explauatiou of the fact that the velocity of the ebb strnam generally exceeds that of the flood is us follows:·
Since the tido wave is 1iropagated most rapidly in doep water, it follows that tho fall of tho tide takes place earlier in tho channel than upon the shore; hence the water tends to flow lator:ally from, tho shore towards tho channel. In this way a couvorgeuco of tho ebb streams may bo expected, especially in shallow bays. With the flood streams t.hc reverse must ho trno, and the ti<lo wavo rising earlier in tho clmnnol a flow of water takes pl:ico toward the shore. In conscrt110ncn of these distinctive characteristics tho obb and floocl assulllo an unequal share in the molding of sau<ly coasts. The ebb current, with its concentration of forces, is a far moro powerful agent than the flood; its scouring capacity nlong its normal course must he moro consic!erab)e, and it creates moro extoush·e draft curreuts . . . . But the ebb is tho primary working agent, und tho chnmcteristic features of all channels and basins, on alluvial tidal coasts, must, as a rule, reilect tho oll'ects of the obb current.

128. .An account of Pourtalcs' metllod for finding the diurnal wave is given by Cl!arles A. Schott in a discussion of Kane's tidal observations in the Arctic Seas, Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, Vol. XIII (1863), p. 78:
The proces8 of decornpo"itiou in use in tho U. S. Coast Survey was at first an anal~·tical one, by computing sine curves; since 18:):), however, n graphical 1>roccss, equfralent thereto, was 1rnbMtituted; this latter method, as intro<lucocl by Assistant L. I~. Pourtalos, may bo briefly explainocl as follows: After the observations are plotted and u traci11g is tuken, the traced curves aro shifted in epoch 12 (lunar) hours forward, when a mean curve is pricked off bot ween tho observed und truced curves; this process ill repeated after the tracing paper has been shifted 12 hours backward; the u.ver:igo or mean pricked cun·e thus obtained represents tho semi-diurnal wave. Ou an axis l>arallel with that on which thci timo is counted, tho difforoncns between tho originally obscn·od au1l the constructocl semi.dmrnal wave wore laid off; this constitutes the cliur1rnl curve. In tho case in hand I Irnvo simplifiocl the iirocess of sopuratiou l>y blackening the under surfacci of the tracing paper with a lead pencil, and running in with a froo hau<l; tho intermodinto curves by tho pressure of a style, 1111 averuge of tho two trncll:l thus left on the lower paper, gnvo tho semi-cliurunl wave in quite un expeditious manner. On tho diagram, the diurnal curve with its epoch of high water nearly coinciding with that of tho semi-diurnal wani, appears iilainly with its variation in Hizo clepernliug on the moon's declination.

Besides the Arctic tides just referred to and those observed by Dr. Hayes, Schott has discussed, in the Coast Survey geport for 1854, the tidal currents around Nantucket and Marthas Vineyard, also the tides and currents of Long Island Sound. Largely through the exertions of .Lli·cry, the Survey commenced tlle annual publication of tables of predicted tides. Tl!ese tables, already alluded to, began witl! the year 1867 and continue up to the present time. In a paper entitled "Methods of registering tidal observations," found in the Survey Ueport for 187U, A very gives a considerable amount of practical information in regard to observing tides; also a description of a self-registering gauge of his own design. 1'he p.i;incipal writings of Jllitclwll are found in the Coast Survey Heports from the year 1854 to the year 1887. Tl!ey deal mostly with the effects of tidal currents upon harbors and sliore lines. Incidental to such work, he devised a tide gauge for exposed stations,t and au apparatus for observing currents below the surface.t The localities treated at some leugth are: Marthas Vineyard and Nantucket, New York Harbor, Monomoy Peninsula, Portland Harbor, Greytown and Uraba, tlle Lower Mississippi Hiver, the Delaware Hiver, and the Gulf of Maine. II is principal papers of a general character are: "On the reclamation of tide lands and its relation to navigation" (Report, 18fi9); "Location of harbor lines" (Report, 1871); "Notes concerning alleged changes in the relative elevation of laud and sea'1 (Heport, 1877).

numerous rules and practical suggestions, which belong to the art of hydrographic engineering rather than to the study of the tides. To these we may add his pamphlet, issued by the Navy Department in 1868, entitled "Tides and tidal phenomena." · Hydrographic work of a similar character has been since carried on by Henry L. Marindin. His papers upon the same are to be found in the Survey Reports since 1880; in particular those for 1888 and 18!)2. 129. Rev. Samuel Hp,ughton's principal writings upon tides are to be found in the Philosophical Magazine (1856, 1863), the Philosophical Transactions \1863, 1866, 1875, 1877, 1878), and the Transactions of the Royal Irhih Academy ( 1854, 1893, 1895). Besides these may be mentioned brief notices in tho Proceedings of the Royal Society of London (1860-1877) and a small book entitled Manual of Tides and Tidal Currents (1870). The tides discussed by him are those around the coasts of Ireland and in the Arctic Seas. He has, in a general way, followed the methods of Airy, and among the quantities worked for are the mass of the moon, the eccentricity of tho lunar orbit, the mean depth of the Atlantic Ocean regarded as a canal running north and south. lVilliam Parkes, in the Philosophical 'fransactions for 1860, treats tho high and low waters at Bombay and Karachi, where the dil.\rnal inequality is large. He combines the two waves of variable amplitudes-the diurnal and semidiurnal-and obtains results agreeing fairly well with observation. In the British Association Report for 1870 (I, p.150), Thomson makes some mention of Parkes' work, comparing with observations predictions made by the latter's method, those made by Thomson's method, and those according to the Admiralty method. Ja.mes Groll has written upon the influence of the tidal wave on the earth's rotation, and upon the causes and climatic effects of ocean currents. These writings are fQJmd in the Philosophical Magazine, American Journal of Science (1864-1876), and British Association Report (1876). 1'. K. Abbott has contributed brief papers on tidal theory to the Philosophical Magazine (1870-1872), the Quarterly Journal (1872), and Ilermathena (1882). Bis small book, based upon the foregoing papers, entitled Elementary Theory of Tides (1888), gives a popular treatment of a few fundamental questions in the kinetic, or rather the canal theory. E. Lacy Garbett, somewlmt after the manner of Abbott, gives a popular exposition of several difficulties in the kinetic theory of tides. He says (Phil. Mag., '1870):
It appears that, without supposing the remark to be in anywise now, I happenecl in 1853 to make the first English mention that tidal friction must increase the length of tho day · . . and to suggeRt (what Delaunay is now considerocl to hose verified) that this cause might have counteracted and masked the shortening clue to con-

traction, so as to account for the non-diminution (or, as now admitted, lengthening) of the <lay since Hipparchus'H
time. [See under Ferrel, "Questions of priority."]

In the Philosophical Magazine for 1874 Alfred Taylor has a paper entitled "On tides and waves,-deflection theory." He advocates the view "that the level of the ocean is nearly represented by high-water mark on coasts and bays where there is free access of the tide and a channel without a sudden taper," instead of being about half-tide level as it would be natural to suppose. He does not believe that tidal action has the smallest effect on the rotation of the earth. His "Deflection theory" takes its name from a supposed deflection (refraction T) which the attractive rays experience in passing through the earth. He deduces from experiments by J. S. Russell and by Darcy a new formula for wave propagation in any depth,p, viz.: v·-3 vp feet per second. E. J. Chapman, in tho Philosophical Magazine for 1874, proposes the theory that the tides result from the compression of the earth's nucleus, which is surrounded with a layer of incompressible water. 130. J. Heinrich Schmick is the author of a book entitled Das Flutphiinomen und sein Zusammenhang mit den sakularen Schwankungen des Seespiegels (1874). Besides treating the matter indicated by the title one part is devoted to earthquake, sea, or ocean waves. Hugo Lentz is the author of a book entitled Fluth und Ebbe und die Wirkungen des Windes auf den Meersspiegel (1879), gives among other things an intelligent account of tidal inequalities, and shows that the notion of the "age" of the tide is quite untenable. As indicated by the title, a portion of the work is devoted to wind effects on the height of the sea, the stations considered being along the North and Baltic seas.

Oomoy, in his book entitled lttnde pratique sur les Marees Fluviales et notamment sur le Mascaret (1881 ), gives an account of wave motion, particularly waves of translation, as propagated up tidal rivers; a study of the mascaret in the rivers of Fra.nce; and the effects of river improvements. J. 0. Houzeau and A. Lanoaster in their Bibliographie generale de I'Astronomie,· Vol. II, pp. 626-635, give a complete list of papers upon the theory of tides, including the effect of lunar attraction upon gravity, the effect of the tides upon the earth's rotation, also atmospheric or aerial tides. The list begins with the writings of Wallis and continues through the year 1880. 131. A. B. Basset is the author of a treatise on hydrodynamics (1888), the seventeenth chapter of which is upon liquid waves. Chapter XIX is devoted to the theory of tides. He treats in brief the equilibrium theory, gives D'.:trwin's development of Laplace's theory, and also portions of Airy's canal theory. Prof. Horace Lamb in A Treatise of the Mathematical Theory of the Motion of Fluids (1879), in addition to a general exposition of his subject, discusses "waves of small vertical displacement" (i.e.," long waves" or" waves of translation"), and illustrates by examples drawn from Airy's treatment of tides in canals. Near the close of his book is a'' List of memoirs and treatises" pertaining to fluid motion. In his Hydrodynamics (1895) the tidal theory is set forth in a concise and masterly manner. It is the best exposition of the theory known to the writer. The chapters entitled "Viscosity" and "Equilibrium of rotating masses of liquid," involve the principal discoveries along these lines made by Stokes, Rayleigh, Kelvin, Darwin, Love, Lamb, Poincar1~, and others. 132. Prof. Wm. Harkness, Washington Observations for 1885, App. III, gives a collection of determinations of the mass of the moon since the time of Newton, adding thereto determinations made by himself from the harmonic constants of over thirty stations. His concluded value from
the tides is 0·012714±0·000222=1/78·653±1.374 (=

8~ + oµ).

At the close he gives a "List of

works consulted in the preparation of the foregoing paper," and here are given numerous references to recent papers on tides. Maj. A. W. Baird is the author of a book entitled Manual for Tidal Observations (1886). In the first part are practical directions for locating stations, setting up and caring for tide gauges, and auxiliary (meteorological) instruments. In the second part are directions for carrying out the harmonic analysis in accordance with the system of Thomson and Darwin. The appendix consists of auxiliary tables used in connection with the analysis. L. d'A1tria has contributed several articles to the Journal of the Franklin Institute, among which are the following: "On the measurement of tidal heights" (1879); " Ou the force of impact of waves," etc. (1890); "A new theory of the propagation of waves in liquids" (1890); "Analytical discussion of the tidal volume admitted into bays and rivers," etc. (1891); "The law of variation of the theoretical amplitude of tidal oscillation,': eto. (1891). In these the meaning of the author is not always clearly set forth; consequently it seems impossible t-0 ascertain just what he ha8 in mind, and why he believes that certain relations obtain. The subjects of these papers are important and his treatment is suggestive; for these reasons they may be worth consulting. Prof. Willimn Ferrel (1817-1891). 133. Ferrel's Tidal Researches, published by the Coast Survey in 18741 include the greater part of his theoretical work. One of the principal oqjects of these investigations is the determination of the effects resuHing from fluid friction when assumed to vary according to a power of the velocity greater than the first (friction=-/ V''), Laplace had generally altogether ignored friction, and Airy had assumed it to be proportional to the first power of the velocity. In either of these cases the fundamental differential equations of motion are linear, but upon Ferrel's assumption they no longer remain so. Dr. Young had assumed friction to be as the square of the velocity, but his treatment is imperfect, inasmuch as it does not involve the equation of continuity. The important and then new subject of shallow-water components is treated at some length in the Tidal Researches, but much more fully in his "Discussion of tides in Penobscot Bay."t

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Ferrel was the first to give, in 18G8, any considerable development of the tide-producing potential. This ucvclopmcnt he reproduces, with some modifications, in his Tidal lfosearchcs. Confining our attention to this later treatment, we may describe it as follows: Laplace's expression for this potential, when ucveloped in multiples of the body's hour angle, gives rise to several distinct parts or classes of terms, which may be written in the general form N, cos s ( nt + LJJ' - 1/'), or N,' cos s (nt + LJJ' - 'f· '), according as the moon or sun is considered, s taking the values O, 1, 2, The first part does not contain the hour angle of the disturbing body, the moon, say; the second class has a period a lunar day in length; the third class a half lunar 1iay; the fourth class one-third of a lunar clay; on account of the smallness of the last it may be clisregarded, for the present at least. The coefficients of these periodic functions of the moon's hour angle have, at a given place, two elements of variability; the one being the factor l/ r\ the other some sine or cosiue function of o, the moou's declination. 1/r3 is equivalent to a constant quantity (which is slightly greater than 1/ p 3 , p being the mean value of r) plus comparatively small periodic terms whose arguments or periods readily follow from the expression for the moon's parallax. Here and elsewhere Ferrel employs circular arguments which vary uniformly with the time, or nearly so. 'fhe arguments of the principal periodic terms in 1/r~ are the moon's mean anomaly, the argument of evection, of variation, twice the moon's mean anomaly, and the mean anomaly of the sun. '.l'he circular arguments belonging to the functions of o, already referred to, are the longitude of the moon and of the lunar node. ·when 1/r3 is multiplied by these functions of o, terms naturally arise whose arguments are simple combinations of tliose in the two factors. In this manner the coefficients of the three principal parts of the moon's tide-producing potential are each cleveloped into a number of terms constant or periodic. The periodic terms in that part (No) of the potential which does not i11volve the moon's hour angle, and which give rise to oscillations in the sea level of long period, really constitute a harmonic development. 'rhe coeflicient (:Ni) of the function whose period is 01,10 lunar day has no constant term, but its pl'incipal term has as argument the longitude of the moon reckoned from the solstice. This coeflicie11t or amplituue is therefore negative during half of each month. The coefficieut (N 2 ) of the function whose period is a half lunar day consists of a constant term together with numerous periodic terms. The most important of these have as arguments the moon's mean anomaly, twice the longitude, the arguments of evection and of variation. Of course the tide-producing potential of the sun admits of a similar development. The tide producing potential due to the attraction of both sun anu moon may likewise be developed. 'l'he terms which do 11ot involve the hour angle of either body are simply added together algebraically. The parts having a half-day period, N 2 cos 2 (nt + LJJ' - 1/Y) and N 2' cos 2 (nt + LJJ' - 1/·'), give, when combined, a resultant amplitude of the form ol>tained when two cosine curves are combined into one. The angle or argument, which is twice the moon's hour angle, becomes in the resultant somewhat altered; but this, too, is in accordance with the combination of two simple cosine carves. The expansion of the resultant amplitude (N2 ) gives rise to a constant term and to numerous periodic terms, the chief of which has as argume11t twice the angfo between the sun and moon. 'rhe arguments of several others have already been mentioned. Ifin the diurnal part, the sidereal (or, more properly, tropical) day had been used instead of the lunar, then the coefficient woulu have had a constant term, and numerous periodic terms; the arguments of the two principal periodic terms being twice the longitude of the moon, and twice the longitude of the suu, 'both reckoned from the solstice, say. This nonharmonic development of the potential is in a form for application to observations made upon high arnl low waters. It shows the theoretical proportious between the various inequalities in the tide. The non-harmonic or inequality methods of Ferrel form an extension to the works of Laplace and Lubbock. He makes use of all observations, and not of certain groups selected for particular purposes as did Laplace; he distributes the ol>serva.tions according t.o the i:iequality sought, usually dividing its period into 12 or 24 nearly equal parts; he analyzes tlie corresponding 12 or 24 values of the ranges or intervals, thereby aetermining the most probable value of the amplitude and position of the inequality; lie compares th(I ratio of the coefficient to the range of tide with tlrn corresponding ratio in the tide producing potential; the failure of these to a~ree implies the existence of what Laplace calls "accessory circumstances," or an

Incorrect assumed mass of the moon, or both. The grei1ter the number of inequalities treated, the more of these constants can be determined. Ferrel usually determines two l;>esides the correction to the mass of the moon,. usiug therefor the three largest inequalities in the (semidaily) tide.· .As some account of bis method of determiniug the coeflicients and epochs of the inequalities appears in § 54, also in § 46, Part III, no further notice will he taken of it here than to refer to Chapter VI of the 'ridal Hesearches, where the tides at Brest are discussed; to his "Discussion of tides in Boston IIarbor;" t and particularly to his" Discussion of tides in New York Harbor."t In regarll to Ferrel's harmonic development of the potential of the tide·protlucing forces, we will only remark that it is the first ever made-at least with any tolerable completeness; that a nnmber of lunar nodal terms are given which arise from the varying inclination of the lunar orbit t-0 the plane of the equator; and that his numerical values of the coefficients of the sun's tide-producing potential are each affected by a term in o11.§ For, the coeflicients of the tideproducing potential of the sun, when expressed as fractions of certain parts of the tide-producing potential of the moon, must involve some assumption regarding the mass of the moon relative to the mass of the earth or sun. Ferrel assumes the mass of the moon 1 /SO that of the earth plus another very small fraction <J J.l of the earth's mass. 134. The fundamental tidal equations are satisfied by assuming the vertical and horizontal displacements of the fluid particle which result from a, harmonic term of the potential to be simple harmonic functions with constant coefficients and coperio<lic with the term of the potential, friction being ignored or taken to be proportional to the first power of the velocity. Bnt if friction be as a higher power of the velocity, then, although the water be deep, the simple harmonic functions just referred to 110 longer satisfy the tidal equations, aud 1,;i111ple lrnrmonie functions of one-third the period of the others must be included in the expressions for the displacements.

Ferrel's method of determining the moon's mass from hnrmonie components. By the equilibrium theory the amplitudes of all components of the same class (long-period, diurnal, or semidiurnal) should have fixed ratios to one another and so to any one of them. The epochs of all components of a class sl10uld he equal to one another. If the speeds of the components were very nearly equal this would, undoubtedly, be very nearly the case; and constant use is made of this fact iu inferring one component from another. In passing from one component to another of sensibly different speed, Laplace assumed that the amplitude is altered by a small quantity, proportional to the difference in their speeds. As will presently be seen, this agrees with Ferrel's work only to the first approximation. Ferrel assumes that the change in the tidal coefficient due to a change of velocity of the disturbing body in right ascension, is not generally proportional to the amount of change in this velocity, as Laplace had assumed.~1 Let i 0 denote the speed per day, expressed in radians, of a component A 0 ; let i, or i, the speed of another component A,, to be compared with A 0 ; and so

On inferring small component.Y. Of course the solution of the equations in oµ, E and G (E', G' being neglected) render it theoretically possible to infer tl)e amplitudes and epochs of other small components which may be required in the representation of the tide. To illustrate, suppose we wish the amplitude and epoch of Q,. From the equations in K 1, 0 1, and P 1 the quantities oµ, E, and Ao are obtained. These values for E and A 0 being substituted in the equation for Q1 give its theoretical amplitude. On page 448 of the United States Ooast and Geodetic Survey Uepurt for 1882, Ferrel thus finds Q1 for Port Townsend and Astoria. On account of bhe large positive value of E, the formula
Q 1 = 0·052 (1- 0·458 E) Ao

gives in each case a value for Q1 much smaller than that obtained from harmonic analysis.

In fact,

Q 1 could have been inferred from 0 1 or K 1 by means of its equilibrium ratio much closer than by

Ferrel's process. Oonsequently his remark that his small inferred value of Q1 is due to a certain shallow water component combining with Q1 can hardly seem probable. The epoch of a small diurnal component like Q1 is inferred by putting

where G is expressed in days. On the next page of the Heport (1. c.) Ferrel thus determines Q1° for Port Townsend, Astoria, and San Diego. The agreement with the analysis is very satisfactory. Similarly he makes use of the equations in 8 2, K 2, and N 2 , determining oµ and E from the semidiurnal group, but with the modification noted below.t
It is readily seen from an inspection of these equations that they can be satisfied only very imperfectly for Pulpit Cove, within any determined values of l5t1 and E, and that they can be much better satisfied by m11Iti11lying the first members of the equations by an unknown constant. This constant is introduced upon the hypothesis that the tid:tl components are diminished by the effect of friction which is 118 a higher power than the first power of the velocity, as I have at various times explained. Upon this hypothesis large tides are diminished by friction more than small ones in proportion to their amplitudes, and hence where there is one lar~e component, as the mean lunar, and a number of much smaller ones, since the amplitudes of the latter are obtained by analysis from the differences between the larger and smaller re~ultant tides, the smaller components are diminished more than the larger ones in proportion to their magnitudes, unless friction is as the first power of the velocity. If we take the first, third, and fifth of the preceding equations for Pulpit Cove, and introduce a constant factor o, we have0·15740=(0·4582-36·2 oµ) (1+0·4255 E) 0·0469o=(O·I256- 3·2 oµ) (l+0·4599E)

oµ,

From the preceding investigation of the shallow-water tides, I think that we cau now see clearly why it is that satisfactory and consistent values of the moon's mass have not in general been obtained from tho relations of the semidinrnal tides; for those relations are disturlwd hy tho various shallow-water components, which <lo not enter. iuto tho theory of deep-water tides, which has been usetl in determining the moon'!! mass. The perfection of the tidal theory, so as to represent accurately the results of observation at all tide stations, and give a correct mass of the moon, depends now mainly upon tho study of the shallow-water terms. With regard to tho det.ormination of the moon's mass, from the results so far as obtained the relationti of the diurnal tides promise bettor success in tho future than those of the somidiurnal tides. Tho diurnal tides are not affected by su many of tho shallow-wator components, and it is probable that these can bo determined from the analy~is of tho observations, since there are two comparatively quite large components with periods differing from those of any others, aml hence ean be determined by aualysis of tho observations; and then from the thoorntical relations given in Schedule III the others can be, at least approximately, determined, and tho components of deepwater tides which they affect can be corrected for their effect. The relations of these corrected results, obtained from the analysis of thii observations, t;honld then agree with tho theoretical relatirns, and give a correct mass of the moon.

137. Chapter IV of the Tidal Hesearchcs treats of tides in canals. He naturally goes over much of tlie ground previously gone over by Airy. As already stated, Ferrel assumed a more general law of fluid friction so that many of Airy's results follow as special cases of Ferrel's. Tl.Je subjects l.Jere considered are canals extending east and west along the equator or parallels of latitude; canals coinciding with a meridian; and shallow canals extending from the sea inland. Under east and west canals Ferrel notices that:

If we therefore suppose tho lunar and solar forces to act upon the 1mme canal, we have tho two tides coexisting without interference, at least when friction is as the first power of the velocity, hut tho epochs or tho two differing, that i.i, the times of high wiLter occurring at different iutorv:lls from the times of transit of tho moon and sun over some ai;sumed meridian, thn high waters of the two do not coincide generally at tho timeH of tho syzygies of the moon and sun, and cause the greatest tides, but some time before or after. It is evident from a more inspection of the expressions, that it depends entirely upon circumstances whether IE and G aro posith'c or negative, tliat is, w!Jether the lunar or the solar tide is tho greater in proportion to the forces, and whotber t.he maximum of the resultant tide happens before or after the syzygies. This will be nlso shown in u. subsequent part of the chapter by means of actual computations in various assmnod cases.

In § 145 Ferrel gives a table for various assumed conditions, or rather constants, relating to tides in canals, such as the length, depth, and friction constants. From these he computes the constants A 0, Lo, E, G, F, F'. From the computed values he notices that friction may iucrease the amplitude of the tide; the amplitudes for different assumed conditions may vary widely; it may be high water at one end of a canal while it is almost low water at the other end; the values ------------ ·--· ----· -··-------···--·---·-·-----------·

ms. Chapter V is devoted to the theory of tides upon an ellipsoid of revolution, and is largely devoted to Laplace's solutions of tidal equations. ln case of the diurnal tide everywhere vanishing if the depth of the water were uniform, Ferrel contends that althougll La1llacc's rmmlt is correct, his ma.nner of solution is incomplete in that it fails to show that the problem remains indeterminate until tlle proper assumption is made regarding the form of a', the excess of the height of tide over the equilibrium height. Ferrel first published his views on this subject in Gould's Astronomical Journal, Vol. IV (1856). In regard to the indeterminate coetlicieut of x 4 , i. e. A 4 , he contends that, since ever so little friction must destroy the initial conditions, thus making the oscillatious de11end entirely upon tlte disturbing force nnd vanish with it, the value of A 4 to be used must be zero. Finally, for various deptlls assumed by Laplace, Ferrel computes anew the corresponding ranges of title, antl linds them, he believes, much more conformable to nature. For references to the late papers of Ferrel and others on this question, see footnote under Laplace. 139. Chapter VI is devoted to the discussion of high and low waters by the inequality method already referred to. The next chapter /,dves various comparisons between theory and observation, the most of which have likewi~e been referred to. Chapter VIII gives some account of the tides of the :North Atlantic Ocean (whose size he attributes t-0 the fact that a canal extending from Europe to America, thus closed at both ends, and having the depth of the Atlantic, has for its free period approximately a half lunar day); t the tides of the Gulf of )iexico, of the Island of Tahiti, and of Lake Michigan; §§ 248-25:~, already ref'errPd to, are devoted to observed variations iu sea level from plaee to place. 'l'he chapter closes with au account of different forms of tidal curves. 140. Chapter IX is upon the tidal retardation of the earth's rotation. This brings the author lmck to his firl'lt scientific paper, a11d which was published in Gould's Astronomical Journal, Volume Ill (1853), pages 138-141. In a note entitled" Questions of priority," published in the ,Journal, Volume IX (1890), page um, and quoted below, Ferrel again makes reference to thit:i subject. Iu this 1853 paper lte makes the first numerical estimate of tidal retardation in the earth's axial rotation based upon mathematical principles, although Kant ltad in 1754 made a rough estimate of it, and it Reeins that J. R l\fayer +and others hail published something upon the suuject. At the time of writing this paper, Ferrel supposed that the then ouserved secular acceleration of tlte moon was fully accounted for by l1aplace's theoretical expression for the same. He was, therefore, led to believe t.liat the tidal retardation was counteracted by a gradual cooling and shrinking of the earth. He points out that if earth and moon are similarly constituted, the retardation in the moon's axinl rotation due to the earth must be to the moon's eflect upon the earth's rotation as the square of the mass of the earth is to tile square of the mass of the moon.

(not merely the motion as estimated by the period of the earth's rotation) was affected because of the tides upon the earth. This gives a retardation more than one-third as great as the apparent acceleration. In his Tidal Researches Ferrel puts these two effects together and finds, from the value of the moon's secular acceleration known by other meai;is, that the tidal displacement due to friction ought to be about 2°. As noted below, he had previously (in 1864) shown tidal friction to be the probable cause of the small outstanding acceleration of the moon. His note entitled "Questions of priority'' is as follows:
It is well known that there is 11 discrepance between tho times of the computed and observed phenomena of certain ancient eclipses, which indicates that thoro has been a retardation of the earth's rotation. A plausible ex11lanation of 1mch a retardation is, that it is clue to the effect of friction upon tho tidal wave. The first suggestion of this explanation is usually attributed to Dclaunay. In Thomson and Tait's Natnral Philosophy it is stated that "About the beginning of 1866 Delannay suggested that the true explanation of tho cliscrepance might be a rntardation of the earth's rotation by tidal friction." Delannay's note on this subject was communicated to the Academy at Paris on December 11, 1865 (Comptes Rcndus, Vol. CI, p. 1023). My "Note on the Influence of the Tides in Causing an Apparent Acceleration of the Moon's Mean l\Iotion" was rea.d before the American Academy of Arts and Sciences on December 13, 186i (Proc. Vol. VI, pp. 379-;{83). In this note it was shown that upon the hypothesis of only a very moderate displacement of the vertex of tho tidal wave by friction, tho resulting amount of retardation of the earth's rotation would furnish an explanation of the discrepance between the computation und observation of the ancient eclipses. The writer also claims that the first suggestion that the cause of tho exact equality between the time of the moon's rotation in its orbit and on .its axis is due to tho effect of the attracting forces upon the lunar tides, was given in his paper "On the Effect of tho Sun and Moon upon the Rotary Motion of the Earth" (.d.str. Jour., 1853, III, pp. 138-142). * .

G. F. Becker, Am. Jour. Sci., Vol. 5 (1898), p. 108, states that Laplace, in the 1824 edition of the System du l\fonde, refers the equality of the moon's periods of rotation and revolution to tidal action caused by the earth's attraction in the still fluid moon; and that Kant considered the tidal retardation in the moon's axial rotation as well as that in the earth's. In a paper published in the Astronomical Journal, Vol. V (1858), pp. 97-100, he examines the deflected course taken by a body moving upon or near the earth's surface because of the earth's rotation. It bas an important bearing upon the general circulation of the ocean and atmosphere. Among other things he establishes that a moving body in the northern hemisphere is always deflected to the right, and in the southern to the left. The radius of curvature of the path is always inversely as the sine of the latitude. For a small range of motion the path is circular, but for a large range it is not; the path is, however, self-returning. Ou pages 113, 114 of the same volume is a note supplementary to the preceding paper. He remarks that the deductions from theory have been verified by some delicate experiments of Foucault.t Besides devising numerous methods for the prediction of tides,t Ferrel in 1880 invented a tide-predicting maclJine. His published account of the machine and its use is found upon pp. 253-272, of the Survey l~eport for 1883. It was designed with special reference to the prediction of high and low waters, thereby differing froII,l Thomson's machine which simply gives the continuous curve. The theory of the machine is also given in §§ 58 and 60 of Part UL His paper entitlP.d "Heport of meteorological effects on tides," found in the Survey Ueport for 1871, refers to observations at Boston. 141. Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin). Thomson seems to have been led to the study of tides through lJis work upon certain physical problems which involve their consideration. Among these problems is that of the rigidity of the earth, which he considers in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society for the year

1863. · He finds that the earth's mass must have an effective rigidity at least as great as that of steel, otherwise the effect of its yielding would have been noticeable upon the amount of the precession or the nutatiou. Moreover, the earth must be for the most pa.rt solid and not fluid as had generally been maintained; for, a thin crust would have to be of fabulous rigidity to prevent tides in the molten matter within. The effect of any elastic yielding is, of necessity, to diminish the range of tide. Calling this range unity for an ocean covering a rigid sphere, the elastic yielding of the nucleus would cause the range to become 5 or i according as the rigidity of the nucleus is assumed to be that of steel or of glass. Supposing the long-period tides to nearly conform to the equilibrium theory, Thomson and subsequently Darwin were led to the careful study of such oscillations. A discussion by the latter of tides observed in European and Indian ports is given in Thomson and Tait's Natural Philosophy.t Poincare notices that the results of this discussion would be in error by a -h part, for a sea covering the entire earth, because the attraction of the disturbed wa1,er is th~re disregarded.t Darwin concludes that because of the water's inertia these tides (the small nineteenyearly one excepted) do not conform to the equilibrium theory suiliciently close for making valid the earth's rigidity derived from them.§ Thomson's paper upon the tidal retardation of the earth's rotation appears in Volume 31 (1866) of the Philosophical Magazine; also in Thomson and Tait's Natural Philosophy.II In Vol. II (1894) of 'l'homson's Popular Lectures and Addresses entitled Geology and General Physics will be found a popular treatment of the tidal retardation of the earth's rotation, given at the close of the ~dress entitled "On geological time." In this volume are papers which treat of the in tern al constitution and the rigidity of the earth, viz., "Review of evidence regarding the physical condition of the earth" and "The internal condition of the earth; as to temperature, fluidity, and rigidity." Another paper is entitled "Polar ice-caps and their influence in changing sea levels." In about 1867 Thomson devised the harmonic analysis for tidal observations. In perfecting it he has been aided by J. 0. Adams, E. Roberts, and more particularly by G. H. Darwin. A historical sketch of this subject is given beyond.,-r In about 1872 he invented the tide-predicting machine, although the first machine for actual work was not constructed until about 1876. For a brief account of tide-predicting machines and refe·rences to writings connected therewith, see§ 57, Part III, of this manual. It is llardly neces- · sary to say that this invention has proved to be thoroughly practical. 'fhe Thomson harmonic analyzer was invented in about 1878. Some account of this machine, along with references pertaining thereto, is given in § 56, Part II. Among the statical problems given in Thomson and Tait's Natural Philosophy are the equilibrium theory of tides, and the effect of lunar and eolar attraction on apparent terrestrial gravity. If a sphere be but partially covered with water, its surface of equilibrium, even if the sphere turn upon its axis very slowly, cannot generally coincide with that of a sphere entirely covered with water to the same depth. The surface (or portions of surface) will, however, be parallel at any given instant to the instautaueous surface of the covered sphere. Upon this fact rests Thomson's "corrected equilibrium theory." Bernoulli treated the case of a small inclosed body of water upon this assumption, but Thomson was the first to suggest its application to tl1e ocean. The etfoct of the land is to modify the amplitudes and epochs in the expressions for the lunar and solar tides. Since the equilibrium theory is not concerned with depths, these modifications depend upon surface integrnls or, rather, quadratures. 0 The work of making these quadratures

In the Philosophical Transactions for 18(;3 Thomson gives, with important physical deductions, an independent solution of a problem previously solved by Lame, viz., the state of strain of an elastic sphere nuder given stresses.

Ile finds that the equations of flow in an incompressible viscous fluid are analogous to those of strain for an incompressible solid. Ile therefore finds it possible, in a measure, to adapt Thomson's work upon bo1lily tides in the elastic sphere to his case of a viscous sphere. llis results regarding the effective rigidity of the earth are in the main confirmatory of Thomson's. He finds a remarkably simple rule for making a comparison between tides in a fluid sphere and in a viscous sphere, also the effect of the internal yielding on oceanic tides. 0 Hesults from Darwin's paper on the precession of a viscous spheroid are subsequently adapted by him to the making of a numerical estimate of the retardation of the earth's axial rotation. tt In the Proceediugs of the Hoyal Society for 187!) he gives a paper entitled "The deterruination of the secular effects of tidal friction by a graphical method," where first appear his wellknown diagrams illustrating the evolution of the earth-moon system.ft Outline of .Darwin's theory of tidal evolution.-Suppose the earth to be in liquid 01· semiliquid condition and to be rota.ting rapidly upon its axis, the period of rotation bei11g from two to four hours.

principle just referred to this necessitates a retreating of the moon and so, by Kepler's third law, an increase in the length of the ''month." The length of the day will go on increasing until day and month shall become equal, ancl computation shows this day or month to be about two of our present months in length. The energy of the system will then be a minimum, for no tides or tidal friction can then exist. The earth-moon system will then be in stable equilibrium, and not in unstable equilibrium as it was when it possessed a maximum amount of energy. The energy curve of the diagrams already referred to, has orbital momenta as abscissm and axial momenta as ordinates. It has one real maximum and one real minimum correspondiug to the two critical periods already described. There is one stage in the evolution when the month has a maximum number of days. For the earth-moon system, as here considered, this number is 27, or about the present number. Iu the paper on the precession of the viscous spheroid (Phil. Trans. 1879), where account is taken of solar tidal friction and the obliquity of the ecliptic, this number is found to be 29. Oonsequently we have passed through the stage of the greatest number of days m the mouth, although the month now is really longer than ever before, owing to the increase in the length of the day. The tides in the moon, due to the earth's attraction, have already caused her day to be one month in length, and tides in the earth due to the sun must finally cause the earth to revolve upon its axis once in a year, whatever length the year may then have. A popular treatment of tidal evolution is given by Ball in a book entitled Time and Tide. Darwin's work upon the harmonic analysis has been largely in the nature of perfecting methods for its application. He drew up the reports of the Tidal Committee, which appear in the British Association Reports for the years 1883, 1884, 1885, and 188G. The report for 1883 is intended "to systematize the exposition of the theory of harmonic analysis, to complete the methods of reduction, and to explain the whole process." The report for 1886 contains, among other things, a method devised by Darwin for analyzing a short series of hourly ordinates, and a method of prediction; these were designed for the .Admiralty Manual, where they may also be found. His more extended .method of tidal prediction appears in the Philosophical Transactions for 1891. He devised a method for the harmonic analysis of high and low waters, which is published in the Proceedings of the .Royal Society, Volume 48 (1890). A concise treatment of the subject of tides by Darwin is contained in the Encycloprodia Britannica, ninth edition. The brothers George and Horace Darwin have made a series of interesting· exveriments for a committee appointed by the British .Association on the measurements of the lunar disturbance of gravity, for the purpose of throwing some light on the elastic yielding (>f the earth. These are described in the Association Reports for 1881 and 1882; they are also briefly mentioned in Thomson and Tait's Natural Philosophy,§ 818'. Historical sketch of the harmonic analysis. . 143. In the harmonic treatment it is supposed, as indicated by the name, that the tide at any given place consists of simple harmonic oscillations, whose periods and amplitudes remain constant-at least for a considerable time. It now seems almost as natural to adopt a series of periodic terms for the expression of the tide as for the '' eq nations" of the motions of the sun and moon. The reasons why tidal workers before Thomson (in about 1867) did not have recourse to such a series seem to be, 1st, the fact that upon the coasts of Europe, where the tides important to navigation were first carefully studied, the tide wave is almost wholly semidiurnal in its character; tllat is, the two high waters or the two low waters of a day are almost equal in every respeet, and so the phenomenon of rise and fall is comparatively simple; 2d, the custom of observing only the high and low waters (in many cases only the former) instead of the entire tidal curve; and, 3d, the idea that tidal work meant rough work, and so did not necessitate an elaborate scheme which, upon its face, seemed to involve more labor than did the less systematic methods. 6584-30

466

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Accordingly the tide was assumed to he composed of two simple waves, one due to the moon and one to the sun. Each had a variable amplitude and period due to the body's varying parallax and declination. The resultant tide was given (as now in the British Tide Tables) by means of a series of tables, based in part upon observations at the port, which generally had the hour of the moon's transit as one of their arguments. Predictions obtained by means of such tables usually made no distinction between the two tides of a day although we find the diurnal inequality described by Colepresse and Sturmy in the Philosophical Transactions for 1668, and Laplace had pointed out that it was due to oscillations of approximately daily periods. But at places where the diurnal inequality is large, the want of a systematic procedure became strongly felt. l"or, the greater the number of important inequalities in the tide, the greater the difficulty in disentangling them; and, moreover, a long series of observations becomes necessary. The foundations of the harmonic analysis were laid by Laplace. Por, he enunciated the principle of forced oscillations; he introduced tidal bodies having uniform motions; he showed how to develop the tide-producing potential into a series of periodic terms, and pointed out the more important harmonic constituents of the astronomical tide; he developed the method of least squares sufficiently far for making it applicable to the determination of the coefficients of a sineand-cosine function of an angle and its harmonics. But he did not attempt an analysis of equidistant ordinates based upon this knowledge, nor did he completely develop the tide-producing potential. Dr. Thomas Young suggested the importance of observing and analyzing the entire tidal curve, rather than the high and low waters merely. Airy showed that in shallow water the difference between the duration of fall and of rise is due to the presence of an oscillation having half the period of the tide wave. Moreover, he applied an harmonic analysis to the tide wave, thus determining, from day to day, the fundamental oscillation and its numerous harmonics. Bis method made use of the entire curve, and not the points of maxima and minima merely. 144. In the year 1867 the British Association, upon the motion of Sir William 'l'homson, appointed a committee for the purpose of promoting the extension, improvement, and harmonic analysis of tidal observations. Thomson's statement to the other members of the committee, with some corrections and additions, is given in the British Association Report for 1868, and from this the following, including footnotes, is taken:
The chief, it may be almost said the only, practical conclusion deducible from, or u.t least hitherto deduced from, the dynamical theory is, that the height of the water at any place may be expressed as the sum of a certain number of simple harmonic functions· of the time, of which the periods are known, being the periods of certain component.~ of the sun's and moon's motions. t Any such harmonic term will be called 11 tidal constituent, or sometimes, for brevity, :i tide. The expression for it in ordinary analytical notation is A cos nt B sin nt; or R cos (11t - E), if A= R cos E, and Il = R sin F.j where t denotes time measured in any unit from any era, 11 the corre2 sponding angular velocity (a quantity such that ;;[!- is the period oft.ho function), Rand Ethe amplitude and the

+

epoch, and A and B coefficients immediately determined from obRervation by the proper harmonic analysis (which consists virtually in the method of least squares applied to deduce the most probable values of these coefficients from the observations). Tho chief tidal constituents in most localities, indeed in all localities where tho titles are comparatively well known, are those whose periods are twelve mean lunar hours, and twelve mean solar hours respectively. Those which probably stand next in importance are the tides whoso periods are approximatoly twenty-four hours. The former are called the lunar semidiurnal tide, and solar semidiurnal tide; the latter, the lmmr diurnal tide and the solar (liurnal tide.t There are, besides, the lunar fortnightly tide and the solar semiannual tide.§ The diurnal and the semidiurnal tides have inequalities depending on the eccontricity of tlrn moou'11 orbit round the earth, anti of the earth's round th" sun, and the semidiurnal have inequalities depending on the varying declinations of the two bodies. Each such inequality of any one of the chief tides may be regarded as a smaller superimpoHed tide of perioll approximately equal; producing, with the chief tide, a compound effect which corresponds precisely to the discord of two simple harmonic notes in music approximately in unison with one another. These constituents may· be "See Thomson and Tait's 'Natural Philosophy', §§ 53, 54. t See Laplace, 'Mccanique Celeste', liv. iv. § 16.

Here y denotes the angnlnr velocity of the earth's rotation, nnd o, 17, G:J those of the moon's revolution round the earth, of tho earth's round thll sun, and of the progression of the llloon's perigee. The motion of the first point of Aries, and of the earth's perihelion, are neglecte<I. It is almost <·ertain that the slow t·ai·iation of the lunur declinatioual tides due to the retrogression of the nodes of the moon's orbit, may be dealt with with sufficient accuracy according to the e<1uilibri11111 mllthod; and the inequalities produced by the llerturbations of tlic moon's motion are probably instmsible. But each one of the twenty-three tides enumerat-0d above is certainly sensible on our coasts. And there are besides, as Laplace has shown, Yery Rensible ti<les depending on the fourth power of the moon's parallax,· tho investigation of which must lie inclnd0<l in t.lrn complete analysis now suggested, although for simplicity they have been left out of tho preceding schcdu!e. Tho amplitudo and tho epoch of each tidul constituent for any part of the st·a is to be determined by observation, and cannot be determined except by observation. nut it is to he remarked that tho period of 0110 of the lunar diurnal tides ugreos with that of one of the solar diurnal tides, being twenty-four sidereal hours; and that tho ll<'Tiod of one of tho somidinrnal lunar declinational tides agrees with that of one of tho semidinrnal solar declinational tides, being twelve sidereal honrs. Also that the angular velocities y - 6 G:J and y -<5- m aro so nearly equal, that observations through several years must be combined to distinguish tho two corresponding elliptic diurnal tides. Thus the whole number of constituents to be datcrmined by one year's observation is twenty. The forty constants specifying these twenty constituents are probably each determinable, with considerable accurucy, from tho data afforded in the course of a year by a good Helf-registering ti<lo-gauge, or from accurate personal observations taken at equal short intervals of time, hourly for instance. Each lnm1r deolinational tide varies from a minimum to a maximum, a.nd back to n. minimum, every nineteen years or thereabouts (tho period of revolution of the line of nodes of the moou's orbit). Observations continued for nineteen years will give the amount of this variation with considerable accuracy, and from it th~ proportion of tho effect duo to tho moon will be distinguished from that due to tho stm. It is probable that thus a somewhat accurate evaluation of the moon's muas may be arrived at. The methods of reduction hithllrto adopted, t after tho example set by Laplace and Lubbock, have consist-Od chiefly, or altogether, in averaging the heights and times of high water and low water in certain selected sets of !-\'rou1is. Laplace commenced in this way, as tho only one for whieh observations made before his time wore available. How strong tho tendency is to pay attention ohiotly or exclus~vely to tho times and heights of high u.nd low water, is indicated by the titleprinte<l at tho top of the sheets use<l b~' the Admiralty to receive the automatic roeord::i of the tide-gauges; for instance, "Diagram, showing time of high and low wator at Ra.msgate, traced by tho tidogange." Ono of tho chief practical objects of tidal investigation is, of course, to predict tho time aud height of high water; bnt this object is much more easily an<l accurately uttaine<l by tho lrnrmonic reduction of observations not eonfinod to high or low water. The best arrangement of observations is to make them at equi-distant intervals of time, and to observe simply the height of tho water at tho moment of obsen·at.ion irrespectively of the time of high or low water. This kind of observation will even be less laborious and less wasteful of time in practice th:1.n the Hystem of waiting for high or low water, and estimating by a troublesome interpolation the time of high water, from observations made from ten minntos to ton minutes, for some time preceding it and following it. The most complete system of observation is, of course, thnt of the self-registering tide-gauge which gives the height of the water-level above a fixed mark every instant. llnt direct observation and measurement would probably be more accm·ate than tho records of tho most perfect tido-~ange likely to be realized.

In this paper the short-period tides treated are K, L, M, N, O, and S, each of which bas a fictitious moon dividing time into component days and hours. As the heights are read upon the mean solar or S hours, a factor (afterwards called the augmenting factor) slightly greater than

The most probable values of these coefficients are found by Laplace's method of least squares.
The tabular forms and rules given by Mr. Archibald Smith, and published by the Admiralty, to b11 uAecl for tho harmonic reduction of the deviation of ship's compasses, have been adopted 11111tatis 11iuta11dis, and have proved very oonvenient.

In regard to eliminating the effects of other components, he says:
The next step followed was to find corrections upon each summation for the influence of the tides determined by the other Hummations, these corrections, for a second approximation, being calculated on the supposition that the first approximate values of A 1 , B,, Ao, &c., already found, are correct.

Having called attention to the shallow-water components brought out from the year:s analysis at Ramsgate, he says:
The shallow-water tides referred to above depend on the rise and fall of the tide, amounting to some sensible part of the whole depth of the water, or, which comes to the same, the 110rizontal velocity of tho water being sensible in compariRon with the velocity of }>ropagation of a long wave, through some considerable portion oJ'. tho sea which sensibly influences the tides at the point of observation. Helmholtz's explanation of compound sounds, according to which two sounds, each a simple harmonic, having 1111, 11t for their arguments, give rise, ifloucl enough, to sounds having for their argu!llents (111 n) t, (m-11) t, suggests that the compound action of the solar and lunar semidiurnal ticles, must give rise to shallow-water tides whose arguments are 2 ( <5 -71) t and 2 (2y -17- 6) t. It is intended with the least possible delay to perform averagings with a view to determine these tides. The great influence of the British Channel, and the large extent of it through which the shallow-water condition specified above is fulfilled, makes it probable that the new tidal constituents now anticipated will be found sensible.

+

In a supplementary report E. Roberts determines, simultaneously by successive approximations the coefficients of five long.period tides, viz.: monthly,· fortnightly (declinational), fortnightly (synodical), annual, and semiannual. In the next report of the Tidal Committee, published in the British Association Report for 1870, the additional components ~, µ, and r are included in tlie schedule. A test is made of the harmonic method upon the Karachi tide, wl!ich has large diurnal components. In the report for the committee, drawn up by Roberts and found in the British A;sociation Report for 1871, the components J, Q, R, and T have been added to those already mentioned. In the report found in the British Association Report for 1872, certain tides have the symbols 2SM, MS, 3MS, 3SM assigned tl!em. A brief development of the tide potential is given. In the report of the Tidal Committee for the year 1876, drawn up by Thomson, are tables showing the relative magnitudes of the components according to the equilibrium theory. These are obtained by developing the tide-producing potential of the sun and moon into a series of sine or cosine terms whose arguments increase uniformly with the time. In this connection it should be noted that Ferrel gives, in the Coast Survey Report for 1868, a development of this potential, not into simple harmonic terms, but into a series of terms suitable for representing the inequalities in the high or low waters. In his Tidal Researches (1874) a harmonic development is also given. He naturally introduces lunar nodal components to account for the varying obliquity of the luuar orbit to the plane of the equator. Thomson dispenses with these by making the theoretical coefficients aud epochs slightly variable, in accordance with the longitude of the moon's node. This is justifiable because tidal components whose speeds are equal, or very nearly so, must preserve, very nearly, their (equilibrium) theoretical relations to each other, as the works of Laplace and Airy go to establish. In fact, the case would be the same for any reasonable law of fluid friction. In the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1878, Ferrel gives some description of the harmonic analysis in general. Here he supplements the work on harmonic analy!:!is found in bis Tidal Researches by giving a number of schedules for the shallow-water components. These

show how the amplitude, speed, argument, and epoch of a given component are related to like quantities of other components. He writes out elimination formulm for a series a year in length. He gives formulm and tables for the eftect of the lunar nodal components upon the amplitudes and epochs of the principal components having almost the same speeds. A report of a tidal committe1.1 consisting of Profs, G. H. Darwin and J. C. Adams, drawn up by the former and published in the British Association Report for 1883, gives a complete working manual of the system. The tide-producing potential is developed into a series of cosine terms as in §§ 38-44, Part II. The amplitudes and epochs as obtained from the analysis are to be so treated as to make the results from different years (at the same station) comparable with one another. '!'ables for this purpose accompany the report. Baird's Manual for Tidal Observations, 1886, gives more extensive tables, together with practical directions in carrying out the analysis. "Computation forms for the reduction of tidal observations" were prepared by Darwin and published in 1884 These indicate how the hourly heights are to be copied for the different kinds of summation. They also show bow the partial or hourly sums are to be treated in the analysis. 145. In the year 1885 L. P. Shidy, of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, devised a set of stencils, or perforated sheets, fully described in Part II, which has done away with the copying process at this office. In the Proceedings of the Royal Society, Volume 52 (1892), pages 345 et seq., Darwin describes a system of strips or scales for indicating how the various summations are to be made. He also mentions Dr. Borgen's tracing-paper sheets, which are substantially the stencils just referred to-the tracing paper being transparent answers the purpose of the holes cut through the stencil sheets. The 'l'homson harmonic analyzer and other mechanical aids to ·analysis and prediction are given in Parts II and III. At present the harmonic analysis is the working system in nearly all countries where tidal work is carried on. The published results are already extensive. We may here refer to some of the principal collections of harmonic constants: · Proceedings of the Hoyal Society of London, 1885, 1889, Reports of the Survey of India. Van der Stok's recent work entitled 'Vind and ·weather, Currents, and Tidal Streams in the East Indian Archipelago. Tide Tables and Heports of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. Note on Fourier series.-In connection with the problem of a vibrating string arbitrarily displaced, Daniel Bernoulli waR led, in about 1753, to the belief that its solution could be expressed in the form of a trigonometric series. Euler, D'Alembert, and Lagrange made use of such series, but failed to determine the coefficients by means of definite int~grals. This was done by Fourier in 1807 in a memoir presented to the French Academy. His treatment of trigonometric series, including the important fact that the function RO represented need not be continuous, may be found in his Theorie analytique de la Chaleur which appeared in 1822, and which constitutes the first volume of his works as recently edited by Darboux. Although such series came into general use, the question of their convergence was not definitely settled until 1829, when Dirichlet pointed out the conditions under which convergence would be assured.·

PREFACE TO PART II.

The object of Part II is to give a sufficient amount of instruction for enabling a person to make reliable observations upon the tides and to reduce them by the harmonic analysis. The system of analysis is that given by Darwin in his report to the British Association for the Advancement of Science at its Southport meeting (1883). The mathematical developments are chiefly those embraced in his report, and its notation has been generally followed. The tables appended to this part have been so numbered as to form a continuation of those appended to Part III, Appendix No. 7, Report for 18!:14. I have to acknowledge the assistance received from members of the 'ridal Division, in the way of suggestions, computations, and the preparation of tables.

CHAPTER I.
OBSERVATION OF TIDES.

1. Selection of sites for tidal stations.

The selection of a site for the observation of tides depends upon the object in view. If a knowledge of the tides at a given point is required, then there is little or no choice in the matter; if, on the other hand, and this is usually the case, a station is to be selected which shall tolerably well represent a considerable area, the following desiderata may govern the selection : Ready communicatioi1 with the sea, deep water at low tides, shelter from storms, freedom from freshets, and non-proximity to the head of a bay or tidal river. At stations located along straits or upon islands, the tide is liable to be peculiar and so not representative for any considerable region. Freshets may ca,use great irregularities in the tide, particularly in mean water level.· Near the bead of a bay various shallow-water phenomena may occur; t also seiches in the lesser bays or coves.t Far up a tidal river the duration of rise may be several times less than the duration of fall; and the range of tide may be nearly obliterated.§ A wave cannot be propagated through a very narrow strait into a large body of water without losing its original form and altering its amplitude. For, there is no cause at work which will imQart to the particles of water sufficient velocity for supplying or taking away the volume of water necessary to maintain the wave form unchanged.II Waves coming around an island from different directions generally produce some kind of interference in certain localities.~1 Where the water is deep, it is not likely that the type of tide change rapidly from point to point, although the shore may be cut up by bays, canals, and straits. 0 The selection of stations for the prediction of tides may be governed by considerations like the above. 2. Staff gauges or tide staves. A tide staff (tide pole) is a graduated rod, usually made of wood, but sometimes. of metal. It is essential to any series of tidal observations, whether the tides are observed directly upon it or not. It should be carefully divided into feet and tenths, by aid of a steel tape or otherwise, and fixed in a truly vertical positio11: to some object affording a steady and permanent support; for example, to a solid wall 01· pile. Its zero should be set below the lowest low water likely to occur, and its length should be more than sufficient for measuring the height of the highest tides kuown at the statiou.tt Where the beach slopes very gently, or where there are great changes in

level, as in rivers, several staves may be required for obtaining all readings. They should, of course, be so set, by means of levels, as to virtually constitute a single staff. If made of wood, the staff should be an inch or more in thickness and four or more in width-say not less than ;/-6 part of its length. To prevent the staff from becoming coated and hard to read, it is sometimes well to provide a ready means of removing the same from its support when not in actual use. This is easily done by leaving such small projections aud definite marks upon the support as ''.:ill enable one to readily return the staff to the same position whenever it is to be read. Metal staves, coated with porcelain, are more durable than those made of wood, aud do not require removing from their supports when not in use. Bench marlcs.-In order to detect any settling or rising in the support of a tide staff, and to enable a person to recover the plane of reference at any future time, several tidal bench marks of a permanent character and situated at various distances from the staff should be established. These marks usually consist of the bottoms of holes drilled into rocks; projections or markings upon rocks or walls; a certain portion of a step, door, or window sill: in the absence of such objects, a buried stone, or a deeply driven stake, pile, or iron pipe may be used. All bench marks should be carefully described (usually by aid of diagrams) for identification. The zero of the staff should be referred to the bench marks by sets of levels run from time to time while tidal observations are in progress. Ordinarily the levels should be reliable to about rto of a foot. Tidal bench marks should, whenever feasible, be connected with transcontinental and other long lines of levels. It is particularly desirable to have all tidal stations which are located upon the same body of water accurately connected with one another in order that all heights may eventually be referred to a common datum. Direction.~ for ob.~erving.-The staff and bench marks established, the observer should read the height of the tide at even intervals of time. Readings at the exact hours throughout the twenty. four hours of each day are preferable for most purposes. The kind of time used is immaterial, provided that it be the same throughout the series of observations. It should always be specified iu the record. In making such observations it is of importance to know the time to within about one minute. In high and low water observations readings should be made every ten minutes, say, for about forty minutes before to forty minutes after each of the four tides of the day. For tides of large range, less than forty minutes will st'l.filce, while for tides of small range more time will be required. In reading a height upon the stafl~ unless the surface of the water be perfectly smooth, note a point midway between the crest and trough of the waves. A glass tube, partially closed at the ends by notched corks, and held alongside the staff, will facilitate making these readings; or glass tubing may be fastened alongside the stafl: In either case the opening in the lower end should not be too large. A small floating body will be found serviceable in marking the surface of the water, or a few enclosed drops of coloted oil may be dropped into t.he tube. 3. BoJJ gauges. A box gauge consists of a long vertical box inclosing a float which rises and falls with the tide. By this arrangement observations may be made when the sea is comparatively rough. The bottom of this box may be pointed or funnel-shaped or, for ease of construction, simply slanted, with a small opening at the lowest part, in order to prevent the accumulation of mud or sand. Besides this, other openings should be made near ·uie lower end of the box. These should be provided with slides for closing such a number of them as will give steady motion to the fl.oat without causing the level of the confined colnmn of water to differ sensibly from the mean level of the water surface on the outside. 'fhe area of the holes left open should usually be between ¥-liu and 1-fi-u- of the cross.section of tbe fl.oat box, and the lower end of the hox should be several feet below the lowest low water. Of course the farther the box extends below the surface of the water the larger may be the openings, as the amplitudes of wind waves decrease rapidly in going downward. (See Fig. 2, Part I.) In some cases the float carries a vertical rod which may itself be graduated,· or it may simply point to graduations upon a fixed scale; t in other cases the fl.oat is attached to a wire or varnished cord which passes over on" or more pulleys, moves an index:

along a graduated scale,· or rotates a drum carrying a pointer,t and terminates in a counterpoise; in still other cases the cord is replaced by a flexible tape upon which graduations are made.t Various combinations and modifications of these styles readily suggest themselves.§ A simple staff gauge should always be located near a box gauge, and the readings of tbe two should he frequently compared: for, it is obvious that the line of flotation may in time become altered; or the access of water may be clogged by sand or marine growths, 80 that the box gauge does not give the true raug·e of tide. In such gauges as have a graduated vertical rod or tape attached to the float, the reading point-i. e., the point of the float box opposite which the movable graduatefl rod or tape is read-should be referred to a bench mark 011 the shore. The vertical distance of the line of flotation from the zero of the rod or tape should be ascertained and given in the description of the gauge. When the grad nations are upon a fixed vertical rod or the float box itself, oue of these graduations should be referred to bench mark. '.L'he distance of the movable pointer above the line of flotation should be given. The obvious rule covering· all cases, e\Ten when the graduations are upon a horizontal or oblique scale, is: 111easure the vertical distance from the bench mark to the water, at the same instant noting the reading of the gauge. The difference between the two values should remain constant. Such reference will detect variations in the working of the gauge, and enable one to recover the plane of reference determined from the series of observations, if such plane should be required in the future. 4. Other non-self-1·egistering ga11ges. A siphon gauge consists of a box gauge upon the shore communicating with the off-shore water by means of a pipe laid along the bottom forming a siphon.II While observations are in progress, care must be taken that all air in the highest part of the siphon be frequently expelled; otherwise the flow in the pipe will be decreased. This may be accomplished by there inserting a stopcock to be opened at high water or whenever the surfac!:' of the water is above it. A closed standpipe or other vessel, preferably of glass, attached to the highest point and filled with water, will serve as a reservoir for the accumulated air. The advantage of this arrangement is that it needs filling with water only occasionally, because the accumulated air does not then immediately decrease the cross-section of the pipe.,-r A pressure gauge n is an instrument, somewhat analogous to a barometer, for measuring the pressure of the water at the bottom of a harbor, in order to ascertain the depths of water and so the height of the tide. The pressure, when the depths are not too great, may be exerted upon a bag filled with air which communicates by means of a hose with a manomet-0r located on board a vessel or on the shore. Such gauges have heretofore generally proved unsatisfactory for longcontinued records, owing to the difficulty of preventing sand or shellfish from increasing the normal pressure of the water. tt Thomson's depth recorder, which indicates depths by the compression of air, can be used for measuring the tides in very deep watei:. A spar gauge H consists of a long spar bolted at the foot with a universal joint to a block or stone, having attached to the portion above the surface of the water an arc of a circle over which passes a plummet line which indicates the inclination of the spar to the vertical. The graduations upon the spar and this angle of inclination give, by aid of a table of sines, the depth of the water at any time. This gauge may be used for off-shore observations and where the current is strong. Owing to changes which are likely to occur in the Rea bottom, the readings of this gauge should be frequently referred to a bench mark upon the shore.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

A tripod or pulley gauge, sometimes used where observations are made upon ice rismg and falling with the tide, has a flexible cord made fast to an anchor on the bottom, and which, passing over a pulley directly above, terminates in a counterpoise. The heights may be indicated by the movement of the counterpoise over a graduated scale; or by the number of revolutions of the pulley·, or by a graduated scale securely fastened to the vertical portion of the rope.

5. The object of these gauges is to trace a curve, or leave some other record, which will enable one to readily find the height of the sea corresponding to any given instant of time covered by the period of observation. Many forms have been proposed or constructed from time to time; most of them, however, more or less resemble the one described by Henry R. Palmer in 1831,t which is probably the first self-registering tide gauge ever constructed. The essential parts of any form may be said to be, (1) a fl.oat and box similar to those employed in a box gauge, (2) a time piece, and (3) some means of recording the height, either in a continuous manner or at short discrete intervals of time. Usually the motion of the float as it rises and falls with the tide is communicated to the recording portion of the gauge by means of a flexible cord which passes over a grooved wheel called a float wheel. t Thence the motion is transferred, but usually on a reduced scale, through some mechanism depending upon the particular kind of gauge, to a pencil which traces a curv.e upon a moving sheet of paper. The paper is driven or carried along by means of a cylinder connected with a well-regulated clock. The pencil is free to move in a direction perpendicular to the line of motion of the paper. In some gauges the paper used is in the form of a long baud, and usually of sufficient length for containing a month's record; it is paid out from one cylinder, passes over a second upon which the tracing pencil rests, and is received upon a third. In others there is but one cylinder and this usually revolves once in twenty-four hours. For gauges of this kind, the sheet of paper is first dampened with a wet sponge or cloth, then wrapped about the cylinder and its edge pasted down; when dry it will so bug the roller as not to slip. In some cases it is made fast with rubber bands. One or several days' record are made upon each sheet; but care must be taken to change the sheet before the record becomes confused by many tracings. In order to keep the float cord and the bands of paper taut, it is necessary to have some arrangement for counterpoising; either weights or springs may be used for this purpose.§

t Tho word "cord" II1a.y be used as a general term including wire, tape, chain, etc. In many forms of gango a rack-and-pinion takes the place of cord and tloat wheel. §For description of several self-registering gauges, the following roforenceH may be consulted: "Description of the self-registering tide-gauge arranged for the Coast Survey," by Joseph Saxton; United States Coast Survey Report, 1853, pp. 94-96.

1''10. 2.-Avery'· one-rollor ti<lo gauge.

This gauge was used by the Survey for many years, the most important change ma1le being the substitution by R. S. Avery of a balance clock for a pendulum clock. This change was necessitated because of the shocks of the waves against the supports of the tide house when in an expo11ed location. Several other improvemeuts were made by Avery. One was the putting of band wheels at 6584-31

the ends of R, R 2, R 4 , so that Rand R 4 conld be moved by R 2 by means of an endless band. This necessitated some means for keeping the paper taut and at the proper tension, which was accomplished by allowing the cores of R and W to revolve with some friction in their cylinders. The friction was produced by friction plates which could be adjusted at will. Another improvement was in the mode of clamping the clock to the cylinder. Fig. 2 shows a one-roller ·gauge devise1l by Avery and described in the Coast Survey Report for 1876. 7. Figs. 3 and 4 s}low a form of gauge now constructed in the Instrument Division of the Survey. This is a three-roller gauge capable of receiving one month's record without change of paper. The float wheel has a spiral groove in its periphery so that the float wire, having been made fast at a given point, may be wound around it a number of times without causing any crossing or piling up. A shoulder of the float wheel has a si111ilar spiral groove for the wire or- cord of the float counterpoise. The float wheel communicates motion to the recording pencil by means of a coarse screw working in a nut. The float-wheel end of the screw rests upon ball bearings; this secures accuracy as well as ease of working. The recording pencil can be accurately set at any distance from the base line by loosening the tloat wheel from the coarse screw and rotating the latter, thus driving the nut and pencil. An attachment is provided for marking the exact hours upon the sheet. This result is accompJished by making use of an additional clock, and adapting its striking apparatus to the sudden movement of the recording pencil each hour. The paper is kept taut by means of' a spring pressing against the roller from which the paper is paid out, and a weight attached to the receiving roller. The distance between the flanges of the rollers, that is,· the width of the sheet, is thirteen inches. 8, For special purposes many attachments or additions have been devised. Of the:se may be mentioned intef}rators, indicators, time-marking and printing attachments. In the more recent gauges, electricity often plays an important part. An integrator is an arra11gement for ~ontinuously summing the heiglits of' the i;ea for the purpose of finding mean sea level. One form of i11tegrator may be described thus:· The cylinder upon which the curve is traced has attached to one end' of' its axle a smooth disk. A small friction wheel with sharp edge has its plane perpendicular to the plane of the disk, and its axis in the same plane as the axis of the cylinder. This small wheel moves across the face of the disk as the recording pencil moves across the recording sheet. The friction between thi,s di:sk and the small wheel causes the latter t-0 rotate. When the phase of the tide is at about mean sea level, the edge of the wheel should be set at the center of the disk; then for phases higher than this, it will rotate in one direction; and for lower phases, in the opposite direction. The resulting· number of rotations is ascertained by additional wheelwork. 'rhis 11umber divided by a qua11tity proportional to the Ieng-th of the period covered by the observations, will show how much the observed mean sea level differs from the one assumed. Another form of integratol' t consists essentially of a pendulum whose variable length is dependent upon the height of the sea for the particular instant. A cam connected with the float wheel alters this length in a suitable manner, while a clockwork registers the entire number of beats. An indicator is either an independent instrument or an attachment to a tide gauge, which shows upon a large dial, or otherwise, the height of the sea at any given instant. The indicator may stand close to the float box and have a mechanical connection therewith; or, it may be located ma11y miles distant and have an electric conuection. A broa1l and clearly-painted tiµe staff, situated in a conspicuous place, constitutes a.n indicator of the simplest form.t

The Coast and Geodetic Survey has. recently eDecte<l two tidal indicators, one at Fort Hamilton, N. Y., and one at Reedy Isl·and, Delaware River. The latter, shown in Fig; 5, has a face thirty feet in diameter. It is proposed to erect a similar indicator at Presidio, Cah In these .indicators the rise and fall of the tide is communicated to a large fioat wheel carrying a pointer., by means of a flexible wire cord. Th<" float wheel is so counterpoised as to keep this cord constantly taut. The end of the pointer moves along a semicircle whose divisions represent foet and half feet of rise· and fall, the zero denoting the position of the pointer when the tide is at the plane of ~ean low water. The a.rrow bead has its two barbs so hinged as to enable it to point either upward or downward. The upward pointing indicates a rising tide, the downward, a falling.

small amount of friction. The lever actuates a vertical rod in the shaft of the arrow, so to speak, aud this in turn actuates an arm or projection attached to each barb. From the figure it is evident that the barbs are of sufficient size to require counterpoising in order that as little work as possible may be required of the float. The object of time-marking attachments is to indicate upon the record sheet the exact hour as given by a clock, either near or distant, iu order to avoid errors which might result from using hour marks made by point'! fixed upon the cyliuder. The gauge of l\lr. Palmer, already referrt'<l to, marked the positions of the hours by means of a punch actuated by a toothed wheel. The figure was in the form of an arrow whose direction was always that of the wind-vane above the tide hom1e. A cross-mark showed the exact position of the arrow to be taken as the hour mark. Since the invention of the electric telegraph, the principle of 11aving a clock make (or break) a circuit has been at the foundation of nearly all schemes for the transference of a particular instant of time, whether for astronomical or other purposes. In this way it is easy to liave one standard clock mark the exact bours upon several gauges simultaneously.· 'l'he time-marking attachment now used upon the gauges belonging to this survey, and shown in Figs. 3, 4, causes the pencil 'vhich traces the tidal curve to 1;mddenly move back and fortli, thus dawing a short horizontal mark from the curve at each exact hour. The advantage of horizontal marks over vertical ones hi that the hourly heights can be more easily read from the sheet. Some gauges cause hour marks to be made at both edges of the sheet, thus precluding such error as may arise from slanting the height scale when the sheet is being read. Printing attachments are designed for the purpose of saving time in the reading of a tidal record. One form leaves a record consisting of two rows of printed figures, the 011e being the hours of the <lay uniformly distributed, and so easily made; the other, the heights of the sea at the exact hours, or at certain fractions of hours. t For ascertai11ing the meteorological effects upon the tides and the condition or density of the water, the following auxiliary instruments may be prodded: A self-registering aneroid lmro111eter, a mercurial barometer for checking the aneroid, a self-registering anemometer, a thermometer, m11l a densimeter or salimeter. Establi8hmez1t mul care of a sel;:registering tide gauge; also the reading of the record. !l. A small house or closed shed must be provided for sheltering the registering portion ·of the gauge. With the most common forms of automatic gauges this house must be located upon a wharf or other staging directly over the float box; hut some forms have been devised in wliich the recording portion of the gauge may be placed wherever convenient. When a special house has to be constructed, it should be large enough to afford room to get at the registering part of the gauge, and be provided with a window for light and ventilation. The site of the gauge should be so selected as to afford as much protection from violent storm waves as possible, while at the Rame time not so far removed from the port for which the tidal observations are wautl>d as to introduce any material alteration in the time or range of the tide. The location should be reaso1mbly accessible, and the structure upon which a gauge is placed should be as firm as is r.racticabl<'. The siphon arrangement already described will be found to be very serviceable where de<>p water lies far out from the shore line.t . In setting up the gauge, care must be taken to have it properly leveled in order that all parts ma.y work freely. The float box should be vertical and the float suspended in its center. The statements made in § 3 concerning the size of the openings apply here fairly well. The scale tn be used can be decided upon as soon as the range of tide at the place is approximately k11ow11.

The zero of the gauge (i. e., the position of the tracing pencil) can be approximately fixed by noting a reading of the water upon the tide staff. A closer approximation is afterwards made in the manner described beyond. An automatic tide gauge of any sort is sometimes called a marif!raph, and the record produced by it a marigram; these names can be readily disting-nhihed as to their application by the more common words "telegraph," the instrument, and "telegTam," the message sent. Jn some forms of rnarigraphs there is a row of steel pins at each end of a cylinder which make small perforations in the paper, the distance between them indicating hours or half hours of time. After putting the paper on such gauges, and before counectiug witll tlle clock, draw a stra.igllt line between tho pins at opposite ends of the cylinder, place the recording pencil upon this line, and then when it is an exact hour (or half hour, if the pins are elose enough to measure that interval of time) connect the driving clock with tlle appamtns, and note the time along the ruled line. In other forms of gauges the llour lines and their numbers are previously marked upon the edge of the cylinder, or upon profile paper stretched around it; but care must be taken in starting to make the record and actual time agree. In tlle most improved forms of gauge the hours are marked upon the paper by a special clock, or by the driving clock itself, using either electrical or mechanical means. l 11 sucll gauges there is no need of starting the record at any whole hour or half hour. On the blank paper, at the beginning and end of each marigram, a note, similar to tllat below, should be written and filled out:
Station.--·---··---·---- .... --···----- ....·....... ---· .·.· ---- .... ---··--·---· ........ ---- ....... . Latitude_ .. ---- .... ------·_ .·.. ·--- ............. __ .

In connection with every marigrapll there should be a fixed tide staff, in order to have a check upon the working of the apparatus; and the n·adi11gs of this ib:ed staff, called staff readings, together with the times of making them, must be recorded on the marigrarn. The best time for taking a staff reading is generally at or near the time of high or low water, because the height of the water surface then changes slowly; but it is also desirable tllat several staff readings be made, at least once a montll, when the water is about at its mean level, on both a rising and a falling tide, in order to show that the gauge is working freely and accurately. A g-611eral form for making such entries upou the marigram is as follows, the whole beiug connected, by means of an arrow or other device, with the exact position of the recording pencil of the gauge at the time:
Monday, Dec. :J1, 18.96, 91t 35 111 A. Jlf. } Unll!fe clock correct. StaJf 6 ..U j~.

Such a note should be made at the beginning and end of each slleet or roll of paper, without regard to the pha,se of the tide. ·when there is a. time-marking attachment to the gauge, time comparisons shonl<l be made at the instant wheu the hour mark is made. Then a note like the following may be used:

P. ill. lVed., Sep. t. 25, 18.95}
Correct time, 1:59 Clock .~et r·ight At 2:01, sta.ff read.~ 6JJ.J.

By cloek is here meant the clock which makes the hour marks, and the above 11ote implies that this cluck made the:.>, o'clock hour mark 1 minute too soon. If tlle hour marks are made by means of electric connections with a standard timepiece, 110 such time comparison is neeessary. Wbe11ever anything unusual happens to the record, such as dh·turbances caused by great stor111s, or a stoppage of the gauge, an explanatory statement shoulcl be written upon the mari· gram. In fact, a marigram should be a complete record in itself, as notes made elsewhere are liable to become peunaneutly separated from ii.

486

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

A graduated piece of paper, wood, metal, glass, or other material, called a height scale, is used for reading the marigram. This scale shows the relation between the marigram and nature; for instance, a scale of one-tenth means that a variation of 10 inches in the height of the water surface is indicated by an inch of change on the record; and with such a scale 1·2 inches on the marigram corresponds to a foot on the fixed staff. Gauges can be made to work upon any desir(·d scale, according to the range of tide at the place; but while it is desirable that the scale used sliouhl be as near as possible to nature,' the average curve produced ought not to occupy much more than one· half of the paper, for unexpected variations of surface level are sure to occur, and these are oftentimes matters of much interest. Upon starting the gauge care should be taken to so adjust the pencil that half-tide level will fall as nearly as possible in the middle of the record paper. In order to make scale readings it is necessary to have some datum line upon the marigram; the zero of the scale is often placed upon the line of punctures made in the paper by the row of steel pins for marking time, or preferably upon a line traced by a stationary pencil. When the gauge is first started this datum line may be placed anywhere, and arbitrarily called such a division of tlle scale as will insure positive readings for the curve, but after sufficient record has been obtained to properly determine the relation between such assumed datum line and the fixed staff, it is desirable to so change the datum as to make the scale and staff readings agree as closely as possible. In the manufacture of marigraphs it frequently happens that mechanical difficulties prevent the obtaining of the exact scale desired, and hence with a new machine one must always find out from the record itself what its working scale really is. 1O. True scale of a marigraph. The true or working scale of the tide gauge is ascertained by comparing the staff readings with the readings of the curve corresponding to these times. The sum of the staff readings near high water, less the sum of a like number of staff readings near low water, gives, when dividt.>d by this number, a certain range of observed tide. Treating the corresponding scale readings in the same manner, a certain range of recorded tide is obtained. The ratio of these two ranges shows how much the true or working scale of the tide gauge differs from the assumed scale u;;e1l in reading the curve. For instance, the sum of the three observed ranges in the fourth column in the example below is 9·7 feet, while the sum of the corresponding scale ranges in the seventh column is 9·9 · . ·. 9·7 79·9=0·fl80; and, since the assumed scale is 10, the working scale is 0·980X10=9·80. Having thus found that scale heights (by assumed scale of 10) must be multiplied by 0·980 in order to give true heights from base line or scale datum, we multiply 26·5 by it, thus obtaining 2o·Ofeet. Subtracting 26·0 feet from the corresponding staff heights, we obtain -3·3 feet. Since 6 heights are taken, this must lJe divided by 6, giving -0·55 feet, which the staff will read when tlle tracing pencil crosses the base line. Or, if we construct a scale of !>·8, i. e., a scale such that one unit of the scale = 9~8 foot, then it should have its division -0·55 marked as the one to be applied to the base line of the marigram in making all height readings. The following metllod amounts to giving larger individual ranges greater weights in tl10 determination than is given to the smaller ranges, and so is applicable where the diurnal inequality is large or where a more elaborate determination may be desired. The notation employed is of a temporary nature. Let "sta,,ff" be a staff reacling taken at or near high or low water. Let" scale" be a reading with the assumed scale at the time of a staff reading. The expression for the scale, true or assumetl, as here used, is supposed to be greater than unity; that is, if the record bas been reduced ten times, it is called a scale of ten, instead of one·tenth. The assumed scale is supposed to be so taken that the ratio R differs little from unity. Let A, B, O, D, etc., be successive ranges (ff\.Y-LW) on staff. Let A', B', 0', D', etc., be successive ranges (HW-LW) on sheet by assumed.scale. If the staff and scale readings involved no error, we shoulu have

That is, if we construct a true scale we must then raise the base line of the sheet by an amount representing 0·53 feet according to true scale, in order that all readings made thereafter may be reduced to staff. It is to be noted that R should remain the same as long as the same gauge is employed; but the value of y must change and so necessitate a new determination whenever the relation between scale aud staff zeros is altered. The number of observations necessary to make a good determination of the true or working scale and position of the datum line depends upon the value of this scale or ratio of reduction, as well as upon the smoothness of the water, the cross-section of the float used, and the care taken in indicating the exact place on the tide curve which corresponds to the time of reading the staff; as a general rule, however, about thirty high-water and as many low-water comparative readings will suffice. The time and height of these staff readings should be recorded on the marigram, and afterwards copied into a i:;eparate register similar to the above form for computation. The scale readings are made by placing the assumed scale so that it corresponds to the arbitrary datum line upon the marigram, and noting where the curve crosses the edge of the scale, care, being taken that the place of crossing is exactly at the point marked as being the position of the recording pencil at the instant of making the staff reading, and that the scale is perpendicular to the datum line. Having thus found the true scale of the record, it is well to have a paper scale constructed for making subsequent readings of the curve. The arbitrary datum line, or the pencil upon the gauge which traces it, should be changed by the value of y, so that the scale readings may· agree with the staff readings as nearly as possible. During the progress of the series· it freque11tly happens that the relation between this datum. line and the staff is altered by some adjustment of the marigraph, and hence the value of a new y mm1t be computed whe11ever there is the least suspicion that any alteration has taken place in the relation between scale and staff readings. If the observer makes any change in the relation he should record the time and amount of such change upon the marigram. It should be made only after he has carefully determined the relation between the datum line and the zero of the tide staff. 11. Additional directions to the observer. In most localities the time may be obtained from railroad or telegraph stations and carried to the gauge by means of a well-regulated watch which has been compared with this standard uot many hours before. The kind of time used is unimportant so long as it is defined upon the marigram and maintained for a considerable period, but it is troublesome to have one kind of time at the beginning and another kind at the end of a series. If for any reason it is found desirable to change the kind of time used, it should be done at some convenient epoch, such as the beginning of a calendar year or the beginning of some mouth, and ample notes should be made upon the record calling attention to such change. When distant from telegraph stations, a carefully co11structed sundial will be of use in setting the watch, for a good sundial will give the time of apparent noon within one minute, which is sufficiently close for any marigraph. Sun time is converted into standard time by adding (Part III, § 27)

+ equation of time, Table 30.

The gauge should be visited once or twice every day, especially at about the times of thoRe high and low waters which occur duri11g daylight., so as to make staff readings, time comparisons, and to attend to the various details necessary to keep the gauge running. In cold weather there is often much annoyance and loss of record caused by the water freezing. At permanent stations a system of pipes passing through, the float box aud carrying hot water is sometimes provided, thus imparting warmth enough to the confined water to prevent the formation of ice around the float. In some cases a few gallons of kerosene oil poured into the float box will prevent freezing, but in this case there is a change in the line of flotation which must be allowed for in tabulating the record. Moreover, unless the float box has been constructed with great care to secure tight joints, the oil is sure to soon leak out. If nothing better can be done when the gauge is frozen up, let the observer secure as many readings of the staff as may be practicable, particularly at the

exact hour8, for even one or two readings a day will be better than nothing for interpolating the \Jreak in the record preparatory to analysis. 12. Preparation of the mar·igram, jor reduction. In those forms of gauge without a time-marking attachment it is difficult t-0 secure correct time throughout the different hours of each day, because there is generally some eccentricity in the connection of the driving clock with the axis of the gauge cylinder, thus causing the paper to move irregularly, while the clock may keep correct time. If such a gauge has its axle marked so that whenever connection is made with the driving clock a given hour will always corre8poud to a fixed portion of the surface of the roller, a scale may be made which will represent quite closely the true length of each hour, no matter how unequal the spaces occupied by them may be. Such scale should be ·copied upon the marigram.· If the cylinder is driven at a sensibly uniform rate it is often convenient to subdivide the space between the time notes made by the observer into equal hour spaces. This may be done by first making a paper scale with uniform hour spaces a little longer than the average hour of the marigram, the scale being long enough to reach between successive time notes; and tlrnn placing it upon the tide curve, so moving and slanting the scale as to make it exactly agree with two vertical lines drawn through that part of the curve referred to by each of two consecutive time notes. 1.'he hours of the time scale, while held in tlJis position, are transferred to the marigram by successive dots, through which vertreal liues may be drawn, intersect.ing the curve at each hour, aud subsequently numbered to agree with the notes. Witll gauges having steel pins for marking tbe hours, the perforations in the paper may be used as hour marks, provided the gauge clock is kept always correct and care is taken to start the record exactly on a line joining two steel pins on opposite ends of the roller. As it is practically impossible to maintain correct time without disarranging the relation of the punctures to the clock, and since there is likely to be some eccentricity in the connection between the driving clock and the roller, it will generally be more exact to use one of the methods just described for ascertaining the hours. vVben the gauge has a time-marking attachment, it is only necessary to number the marks made by the mechanism. Jligh and low waters.-lt is customary to tabulate the time and height of the high and low waters, but there is often considerable difficulty in fixing upon the proper part of the curve in making these readings. The aim should usually be to i;:elect the highest and lowest points of what appears to be the true tidal curve. Some persons select the highest and lowest portions of the curve, regardless of accidental disturbances, as well as of peculiarly shaped high or low waters, but even this latter is likely to introduce considerable irregularity in the times, because the tide curve is generally not symmetrical about its extreme points, and these points are liable to swing back and forth during a lunation. In such cases the usage has ~ometimes been to imagine a small portion of tho curve near high or low waters cut off by a horizontal chord, and to take the poiut where the perpendicular from the middle of the chord cuts tho curve as the point of high or low water. It is convenient to have a small scale, equal to one hour, subdivided iuto six parts, so that the number of minutes beyond any hour mark may be easily estimated. The height is read by so placing the scale as to make it agree with the datum liue, holding it perpendicular to this line, and noting where the curve at the point selected crosses the edge of the scale. · Hourly heights or ordinatcs.-lt is very important that the height of the sea at each exact hour should be ascertained and recorded. As the marigram has beeu already subdivided into hours, it is only necessary to see that the scale agrees with the datum line, is perpendicular to that line, and iutersects the curve exactly at the hour mark. A form for tabulating hourly heights is given in § 61. A correct datum line upon the marigram, and the relation between staff and scale can be found from the staff readings by aid of § 10. Instead of actually ruling in a new datum line, it is well to mark upon the scale the value by which the assumed datum has IJeeu found to difter from the one corresponding to staff; by placing this mark of the scale upon the datum line, the scale readings will then approximately agree with the staff readings.

14. Principle of forced oscillations.

This principle, due to Laplace,t is of fundamental importance in the analysis and prediction of tides; it may be -stated thus: The state of any system of bodies in whick the primitive conditions of the motion have disappeared through the resistances which the motion encounters, is coperiodi<J with the forces acting on the system. If there were but a single strictly periodic force acting upon the given i.ystem, the effects of successive periodic actions must eventually become identical, and their periods become that of tlrn force. Now the magnitude of any tide-producing force being very small in compariRon with the force of terrestrial gravity, the accelerations imparted to the fluid particles must be very Rmall, ancl so must be the resulting displacements. Therefore if several such forces act simultaueously, they act as if totally independent of one another and so their effects permit of superpositio11. This being so, the disturbance may be regarded as made up of terms whose periods are the periods of the several forces. Here is the clue to what periodic terms ought to be found in the tidal wave; for, there ought to be au oscillation corresponding to each term of the causes producing the tide. Such terms follow from the development of the tide-producing potentials of the moon and sun. Bt·fore proceeding to this development, it may be well to consider what periodic terms are suggei;;ted from a superficial view of the nature of the tide-producing causes.
WIIA.'r COMPONENTS, OR PERIODIC OSCILLA.'flONS, SIIOULD EXIST IN 'l'HE TIDE.

15. Since the lunar tide is due to the difference between the moon's attraction upon the earth as a whole and the enveloping sea, there ought to be set up an oscillation whose period is a half lunar day; and likewise, because of the sun's attraction, an of'lcillation whose period is a half solar day. Confining our attention to the case of the moon, it may be observed that the actual lunar day is not of constant length, because the moon's orbit is a11 ellipse, not a circle; becau:se it is

inclined to the plane of the earth's equator, and this inclination is not constant; also because the sun disturbs the moon, producing evection and variation. These irregularities in the moon's apparent diurnal motion will, sooner or later, be in certain ways reflected in the lunar tide, which but for them might be assumed to be a wave of uniform period for all places, and of constant · amplitude at any given place. Denoting the strictly periodic portion of the tide by M2 , let us inquire, what other. strictly periodic oscillations or components of about the same period ought to exist in the lunar tide¥ Let m2 denote the hourly speed of M2 , and II the period, in hours, of some inequality or irregularity in the m:>on's motion. If a component have the speed
(5)

it will gain or lose on M2 one period during the time II, as can be seen by multiplying this speed by II."' In other words, II is a synodic period for M 2 and a component with either of the above speeds. The nature of the inequality must be taken into account in order to ascertain which sign to take, and also whether, for the present purpose, II should include the whole or the half period as usually given. The development of the tide-producing potential shows that the two components, one for each sign, are sometimes required.

This suggests that there should exist because of the irregularity in the moon's motion due to its varying parallax, one or both of these components, which may be denoted by Li and N 2 · Si11ce the moon's apparent diurnal motion is slowest when she is in perigree, the perigean tides should have a longer period than the mean tide; and because of the nearness of the moon to the earth, the range should be increased. The most of the parallax inequality in the tide must be due to that co111pone11t which, when coinciding with M 2, increases the length of the period; in other words, N 2 is the larger lunar elliptic component, and L 2 the smaller lunar elliptic component.

Since the moon's apparent diurnal motion is, creteri.~ paribus, greatest when she is in the equator, and since her tendency to prolluce tides is then greatest (Principia, Bk. II I, Pro11. XXl V), the speed of the component causing the declinational iuequality 'in the semidiur11al tide is greater tl1a11 the speed of M2· This component is the lunar part of K 2.

Oreteris paribus, thti apparent diurnal motion of the moon is least when she is in the syzygies, and her distance to the earth is then least. (Principia, Bk. I, Prop. LXVI, or§ 87, Part I.) This shows that the lunar tide is then greater than usual and of longer period; consequently the component causing the variational inequality in the semidiurnal tide is the one whose speed is less than that of M2. It is denoted by µ2. If the other component, whose speed is 30° per hour, exist at all it will unite with S:i. Let II= half of the evectional period in the moon's parallax. Every time the line of apsides passes the sun, the eccentricity of the lunar orbit becomes a maximum (Principia, Bk. I, Prop. LXVI). That is, the amplitude of the oscillation (N 2 ) which mainly accounts for the parallax effect upon the tide, would, if no additional component were introduced, have an inequality of a period of about 206 days. A component which would probably represent such an iuequality must have for its speed one of the two values,

At such times of greatest eccentricity the progression of the line of apsides becomes a maximum. This increases the anomalistic month, and so, by the above formula for the speed of N 2 , must increase the speed of the oscillation representing the most of the parallax effect at the time when its amplitude becomes a maximum. Consequently, the principal component due to the moon's evection should have the speed 28·5125831. This component is designated as v 2· 16. Whenever the moon is not upon the equator, the two tides of a day will generally differ because the moon's north polar distance at the time of a superior transit is not equal to her south polar distance at the time of an interior transit. In other words, if we suppose the moon aud antimoon to successively cross the meridian of a place, the one will be a body of north declination and the other·a body of south declination. It would be natural to try to represent this inequality by a wave of variable amplitude attaining a maximum wbeu the moon is far from the equator and vanishing at about the time when tlte moon crosses the equator. The speed of such a wave should be m,, or the apparent diurnal motion of the moon about the earth. When the amplitude becomes zero the phase of the wave should suddenly change by 1800. To avoid this great variability in amplitude and this sudden change of phase, a component, lunar K 1 , is suggested which shall gain 360° on the moon in a tropical month, and another component, 0 1 , of about equal amplitude, which shall lose the same amount; for, the speed of the resultant wave will evidently be that. of the moon or m 1 , its amplitude will be a maximum when the moon is far from the equator, eitlJCr uorth or south, and zero when she is upon or near the equator.

The same line of reasoning would lead one to infer that all lunar components might be accompanied by small components· of almost the same speeds as th01m1elves for taking into account the effects of the regression of the moon's node. For most purposes it is preferable to suppose this inequality accounted for by means of slight variations in the amplitude and epochs of the components which do not owe their origin to the movement of the node.

and we obtain two speeds of which the first is k 1 and the second is denoted by p 1· There are other oscillations having a truly astronomical origin, lmt their speeds, as a rule, are less readily obtained from the mean motions of the moon and sun than from the speeds of certain components like 0 17 Ki, etc. (See Table 2, already referred to.) 17. 0.vertides. So far we have been mainly concerned with the periods of the oscillations. That they a1e simply harmonic is not self evident. In fact, where the water ifl shallow the crest of the tidal wave must generally move faster than the trough. This, as the wave proceeds, causes the duration of fall to exceed the duration of rise. If upon a simple harmonic oscillation we superpose in a suitable manner a small one of double the speed, we obtain the effect desired. We are therefore led to infer that there probably exist along with M2 , S 2, Nz, etc., the components M4 , S 4 , N 4 , etc. Again, it seems natural to suppose that, for instance, the principal lunar part of the tide may have other departures than the kind just noted from a simple harmonic form. But whatever its shape may be, it can be represented by a Fouri1·r series of terms whose speeds are simple multiples, like 2, 3, 4, etc., of the speed of the principal component. That is, M2 may naturally enough in shallow water be accompanied by M4, M 6 , M0 , etc. So for S2, and other components. These are sometimes called overtides because of their analogy to overtones in musical sounds. 18. Compound tides. Jn shallow water there may be sensible compound tides; that is, components whose speeds are the sums or differences of the speeds of the principal components. These were suggested by Helmholtz's theory of compound sounds. In fact, we have only to multiply together, in pairs, the principal simple harmonic (cosine) terms which constitute the tide in order to ascertain the theoretical relations between their amplitudes, arguments, and epochs. Ferrel gives quite exteuded lists of such components in the Hcport of the United States Coast and Geodetie Survey for 1878, pp. 274-276 (about equivalent to Table 3G), and Darwin, a list of the more important cases in the British Association Heport for 1883, pp. 74-78.

.At a given place (since g and h are constant) the time distortion is evidently proportional to

Mz; for, to a first approximation, all components, whatever their amplitudes, require about the
same time in their propagation from point to point-the velocity being (gh)~. For convenience, suppose Mz to be a somewhat varying amplitude, that is, let Mz not stand for the true amplitude of M2, but the resultant amplitude when combined with another component of about equal speed. Let its value on two different occasions be. deuotl'd by (M 2 )" (M2 )w The question now arises, how do the corresponding amplitudes of M 4 compare with each otherY In the first case the duration of fall exceeds one-fourth lunar d:~y by an amouut proportional to (M 2),, and in the second, to (M2) 11 , according to the equations just obtained But it can be readily seen by combining waves [eqs.

that i;;, if the amplitude of a component be different on two occasions, the amplitude of the overtide ha\'ing double tbc speed of the fundamental, will vary as the square of the amplitude of the fundamental. (Applying this to the diurnal and semidiurual waves, one might perhaps surmise that the amplitude of the diurual wave, aud i:;o the diurnal inequalities, vary, from place to place, as tile square root of the semidiurnal range.) Suppose that the cause of the variation in M 2 is the addition of S 2 , producing spring tides. At the times of the spring tides, what is the amplitude x of tbe overtide M4 '

Thus we see that if the quarter diurnal component is to have an approximately fixed position upon the semidiurual wave it must have a variable amplitude. But, jnst as in § 15, we infer the speeds of one or two additional quarter diurnals by putting fl= a half synodic month expressed in hours.

Similarly, tnere should be compound tides dependent upon M2 , N2; M2, K2; etc.

So for S 2 ,

The speed of MS being the speed of M 2 plus the speed of 8 2, its phase must of course vary as the sum of the phases of M2 and 8 2 varies, and so it is customary to take its initial argument equal to the sum of the initial equilibrium arguments of M 2 and S 2· At spring tides MS should conspire. with M4 , and at neap tides it should interfere. The speed of M 4 is equal to twice the speed of M2, and it is customary to take for its initial argument twice the initial equilibrium argument of M2. ·"ms= m2 + s2; argo MS= argo M2 + arg0 S2;

The more general treatment of this subject is given in § 48. 19. Jlfeteorological tides. The land and sea breezes, and the daily variation in atmospheric pressure, may give rise to a tide whose period is a solar day; and, as the cause is not directly astronomical, it is natural to suppose that overtides woul<l have to accompany the simple harmonic form in order to represent a tide whose origin is so remote. The change of' seasons gives rise to an annual tide, Sa. Such a tide must represent the stagPs of rivers at river stations. As very high stages are usually of comparatively short duration, it is not reasonable to suppose that a single component can represent the annual changes in river level. In other words, the overtides become comparatively large. It is hardly necessary to add that while the determination of meteorological tides from long series of observations is valuable for some purposes, their recurrence is not generally certain enough to make them of much value in tidal predictions. The foregoing has led to, or at least suggested, the most of the ccmponents which are to he sought in the process of analyzing the tidal wave. Some of those already brought to notice are, from the nature of their origin, too small to be included in a working schedule. It may be worth while to here call attention to a practical application of § 18, or rather to empiral rules there hinted at. 20. Rules for inferring certain nonhannonic quantities from values at a neighboring station. Suppose that for a secondary station we know the value of a semidiurnal range of tide, say Mn, and wish to estimate the value of another semidiurnal range, say Sg, or Np from a neighboring principal station where the tide is supposed to be fuJly known. We naturally put

(25)

(Np)"= (Np), (Mn)". (26) (Mu), Similarly for perigean and apogean ranges. But § 18 suggests the l1ypothesis which observations have in a measure corroborated, that the amplitude of the diurnal wave aud all quautitie8 proportional thereto vary between neighboring stations not as the ratio of the mean ranges of tide varies, but.rather as the square root of this ratio.

(37)

'J'he mean longitude of a body may be defined as the distance along any given great circle moved over by a uniformly moving or "mean" body from the intersection of its orbit and the circle. It is simply the time since the body passed such intersection multiplied by the average angular velocity of the l)Ody. For a fixed body or point the mean, as well as the true, longitude is measured from the foot of the perpendicular let fall from the body or point in question upon the circle in which longitude is reckoned. uator If two or more great circles meet in a point, each circle will have a mean body of its own; lmt all these mean bodies will be at the same distance, at any given instant, from the orig-in; that is, the real body will have the same mean Fin. fi. longitude reckoned in whichever circle. If orig'ius in the several circles be taken a constant distance from the common intersection, the mean longitude in each circle will be altered by the same amount. The mean longitude of the sun (h) from 'Y' is the same in tho equator a,; in the ecliptic. If v denote the H.. A. or mean longitude of I in the equator (see Fig·. 6), then h- vis the sun's mean longitude from the point I. If we take a point 'Y'' upon tho moon's orbit such that Q 'Y'' = Q 'Y', and denote the distance 'Y'' I by~' then the moon's mean longitude from I, whether in the orbit or the equator, is s - ,<;, s being her mean longitude from 'Y"' or 'Y' in the orbit or the equator. Fig. 6 supposes the ouscrvcr to be within the celestial sphere looking outward. The ecliptic, moon's orbit, and the celestial equator are suppose<l to he fixed, while the projection of the terrestrial meridian upon tho celestial sphere moves eastward, as indicated by the arrows, and at the rate of 15° per sidereal hour. S' is a slowly moving point upon the equator, distant 180° from the mean sun (S), aud so 'Y" S'= h ± 180°. When the meridian passes over the point S' it is mean local midnight, where we shall assume t, the mean solar time, to bo ~ero. "When the meridian is at ;r, then t, or 15 t, = S':l'.

Most tables of the moon and sun give mean longitude of the lunar and solar elements reckoned in the orbit or the ecliptic and from the origin 'r. To refer any of them to the equat-0r, using I as origin, it is necessary to know the mean longitude of the moon's node (N); then v and.& can be obtained by solving the spherical triangle 'r IQ. To avoid this labor the values of v and for any value of N may be taken from Table 7. In all of the work pertaining to the reduction and prediction of tides, we shall adopt the fol· lowing (Hansen's) values for s, p, h, p 1, and N, which are those used by Darwin in his report for 1883: s = 1500·0419, + [13x3600+1320·67900)T + 130·l764D + oo·5490165R,

For a complete solution see books on mathematical astronomy, such as Dziobek's Mathematical Theories of Planetary Motions, Resal's Mecanique Celeste, etc. For most tidal purposes it is sufficient to carry the solution to the second powers of e, and this may be easily accomplished in the following manner: If we develop by 'raylor's theorem the value of v from the first equation written in. the form v=cos- 1 (cos E+h) where

Astres fictijs, fictitious moons, etc. For aiding the imagination, Laplace· introduced a set of fictitious bodies having certain analogies t-0 the mean sun and mean moon. Such bodies move uniformly in the celestial equator and at a co11stant distance from the earth. The successive transits of any astre fictif across a given terrestrial meridian defines a corresponding day, differing in length hut little from twentyfour mean solar hours. The Tidal Committee of the British Association made use of such fictitious bodies as the harmonic analyRis of tides seemed to demand.t By the introduction of suitable bodies, which were not used by Laplace, the parallaxes of the mean sun a11d mean moon become constant. The assigned position of a fictitious body has, of course, a direct influence upon the epoch of any component tide determined with reference to the body. The following quotation from a paper by Thomson is found upon page 481 of the British Association He port for 1878:

It is to be remarked that there are two K bodies always 90° apart in the celestial equator. Darwin discards the astres jictijs, and says in his report '.or 1883:
In tho present Report the method of mathematical treatment differs considoru.bly from that of Sir William Thomson. In particular, ho has followed, and extended to the diurnal tides, Laplace's method of referring each tide to the motion of an astre fiot~f in the heavens, and he considers that these fictitious satellites nre helpful in forming a clear conception of the equilibrium theory of tides. As, however, I have found the fiction rather a hindrance than otherwise, I have ventured to depart from this method, and have connectecl each tide with an 'argument,'* or an angle increasing uniformly with the time and giving by its hourly increase the 'speed' of the tide. In the method of the astrcsjictifs, the speed is the difference between tho earth's angular 'l"'eloeity of rotation and the motion of tho fictitious.eatollite amongst the stars. It is a consequence of the difference in tho mode of treatment, und of tho fact that the elliptic tides aro bore dovelopocl to a higher degree of approximation, that nono of the 1>resent Heport is quoted from the previous ones.

In case of a diurnal component, the argument is evidently the hour angle of the corresponding astrc jictif; in case of a semidiurnal, twice the hour angle; etc. Since these bodies do not really exist in nature, but are created for aiding the imagination, it seems justifiable to carry the fiction one step farther if simplicity can be thereby attained. Imagine a system of bodies to have an apparent aud uniform motion around the earth from east to west. Let their periods be equivalent to the periods of the various short-period tidal compo· nents. That is, an M 2 moon or body will cross the meridian of a place twice each mean lunar day; an M4 moon, four times; etc. They are to be so placed in the celestial equator that the equilibrium arguments of the components ( V + u) are the hour angles of the fictitious bodies. Each body bas the property of producing a

the value of a linear function involving them (a,x + b,y + c,z). This function changes its value for different assigned values of the coefficients (a, b, c) which are absolutely known from theory, and which are made to vary in accordance with the circumstances of the observations. Let - k; denote an observed value under the circumstances whose characteristic is i. If there is no error in thi3 measurement, then
a,x

(87)

If there were three accurate measurements (i = 1, 2, 3), then x, y, z would be accurately determined; if the three measurements were not accurate, .1·, y, z would still be definitely, though uot accurately, determined. Now when there are more than three (i = 1, 2, 3, . · . . n) slightly inaccurate measurements, the values of x, y, z determined from auy three observation equations will not exactly satisfy the others. As it is not known which observation is in error, all may be assumed to be slightly in error, and the vr.Jnes of x, y, z might be found by taking the mean values of all determinations. But such a process would i:ot give the most proba'!:>le valnes of the unknown quantities. In~tead of actually solving all equations for x, JJ, z, suppose t11ese latter to have such values as are the most probable under the given set of measurements. Ulearly none of the observation equations will now have zero as its right-hand member, but the one whose characteristic is i will have a small residual v,, say, instead of zero. If x, y, z have their most probable values, it can be shown from the theory of accidental errors that they render the sum of the squares of the residuals (1· 12 + v 2 ~ + + 1J, 2 + + 1J. 2) of then observation equations a minimum.· But the minimum of the function i=n (88) 2' (a;x + b,y + c,z + lc,) 2 i=l

is found by equating each of the partial derivatives to zero; for, one can show that Lagrange's conditions are Ratisfied for this function.t The three resulting equations (which are the three normal et1uations) are i=n

Since the tide-producing potential represents work, viz., the force of terrestrial gravity multiplied by the height of the tide, the height at various places must be the tide-producing potential divided by g.

So far in this chapter, the mutual attraction of the water particles has been disregarde1l in the tide-producing potential. Practically nothing is lost by so proeeeding, because the continents and the inertia of the water do not permit the tide to assume a Rpherical harmonic deformation. A complete statement of the equilibrium hypothesis requires this :;;ource of disturbance to be noticed, and to that end an application of the special analysis referred to by Laplace will be given. It may be here noted that Newton took account. of the mutual attraction of the particles in his theory of the figure of the earth, and in his tidal theory derived therefrom.· A spherical hannonic distribution of density of attracting matte1· or, icltat amounts to the same thing, a thin attracting layer of corresponding thickness, on a spltericalsurfacc,produces a .~imilar and .~imilarly placed spherical lw.nnonic distribution of potential over any concentric spherical surface throughout space, external and internal. Let us ascertain the potential of such a spherical surface at poi11ts along the axis of symmetry for the distribution (or thickness), taking the center of the sphere as origin; then by replacing the distance on the axis from the origin by p, the distance of any point in space from the origin, and multiplying each term of the developed potential by a surface l1armonic of the proper order, the resulting expression of the potential is true for points whether upon the axis or not. For an internal point we know that the equation (147), often written 9 2 Y =0, must be satisfied because (see§ 32) auy term of the form p· P,. is a solution; consequently an expression involving the Rum of such terms must be a solution; and it is the required solution because when () = O it reduces to the expression known to be true along the axis.

CHAPTER IV.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE TIDE- PRODUCING POTENTIAL.

37. The tide-producing potential of' the moon at any given point depends upon the geographic position of the point and upon the particular time chosen. Of course the direction and distance of the moon enter into the value of this potential, but they are both functions of the time. Consequently the expression of this potential should be in terms of' the coordinates of the influenced point and functions of time. l\foreover, since the tide-producing causes are periodic in their character, the time functions should be simple harmonic functions; that is, functions consisting of terms of the form A cos (at+ a) or A sin (at+ a) where A, a, and a are constant, while t, the time, varies uniformly. If c denote the moon's mean distance (i. e., the semiaxis major of the orbit), and e the eccentricity of the orbit, the latus rectum has for its value c (1 - e2 ). If 'U1 1 denote the longitude of the perigee from the intersection of' the orbit with the plane of the equator and l the longitude of' the moon from the same origin, both reckoned in the plane of the orbit, l - r;;, is the moon's true anomaly. The polar equation of the ellipse representing the orbit, taking the origin at the focus, is
c (1 - c2)

r

=l+ecos(l-'UJ,).

(199)

Since the most important part of the tide-producing potential Y, § 29, depends upon the third power of
1 r'

we cube both members of this equation and obtain

where terms having the factor c:1 are omitted. If <5 1 denote the moon's mean longitude measured in her orbit from the intersection, and G5 1 the mean, as well as the true, longitude of the perigee measured in the same way, the mean anomaly will be 0 1 - rv,. The solution of Kepler's problem, § 23, gives the equation (201) 'fhis value of l substituted in (200) gives an expression for (202) in terms whose angles or arguments vary uniformly with the time. The next step is to express cos2 () _ &in functions whose angles vary uniformly with the time. I ts value as given by (138) consists of functions of ]11, p2, p 3 and m 1, 11ii, ·m3 ; but as Pi, p2, p 3 depend ouly upon the position of the disturbed particle with respect to axes fixed in the earth, they do not involve the time. We have, then, to express them-functions, or quantities proportional to them, by means of functions whose angles vary uniformly with the time,

Suppose the moon's orbit to be a fixed circle of the celestial sphere concentric with the earth; then its inte1·section with the celestial equator is a fixed point to which the rotation of the earth maybe referred.· Let the z-axis be the one about which the earth rotates, carrying with it the xaxis and the y-axis which lie in the plane of the equator. Let x denote the right ascension of the extre11Iity of th,e x-axis reckoned from the intersection. Fig. 10 shows the appearance of the cele,.;tial sphere viewed from without. The meridional arcs .Tz, yz revolve in the direction indicated by the arrows. If Jll denote the position of the moon, her true longitude from I being l, then

38. Before completely expressing the functions, X 2 - Y 2 XY, etc., as simple harmonic functions of the time, it is of interest to examine the special case where the moon's orbit is assumed to be circular instead of elliptical. Since e=O, equation (201) gives l=l.'> 1 ;

From this it appears that there are three classes of tidal causes, and so(§ 14) three classes of tides: i< Semidiurnal tides, period about one-half day. Diurnal tides, period about one day. A fortnightly tide, period one-half tropical month. 'rhe constant term in (218) indicates a permanent change in sea level because of the existence of the moon. From§ 13, the hourly variation in xis y=l5·0410686, and in 6 1 it is 6=0·5490165; consequently the component tides have for speeds the following values: 2 (y- 6) = 28·9841042 = m2 , 2 y = 30·0821372 = k 2, 2 (}' + 6) =31·1801702=y - 2 <J = 13·9430356 = 01, y = 15·0410686 = k1, y + 26=16·1391016 = oo, 2 <J = 1·0980330 = mf.

(219)

The relative size of the components occurring in any particular X-Y-Z function can be roughly determined by putting p =cos~ (230 27'·3)= 0·979 and q =sin 2- (23° 27'·3)= 0·203. Upon inspect· ing Y Z or X Zit is seen that the amplitude of 0 1 is a trifle greater than that of lunar K 1· 39.

Upon following out the work indicated, and reducing by elementary trigonometry, the function X 2 - Y 2 becomes expressed in a series of cosine terms, all angles varying uniformly with the time. From the expression for X 2 - Y 2 analogous ones for -2 XY, YZ, and XZ may be obtained. Instead of the above, the following method, used by Darwin, is chosen because of certain symmetries which it puts in evidence: 'l'he ni-functions contain trigonometrical functions of the form sin (2 l + a) and cos '2 l + a) Let (226) then

From (227) and (228) it may be inferred that the expression for - 2 XY is deducible from that of X 2 - Y 2 by putting sine in the place of cosine. The same inference may be made otherwise. For, - 2 m 1 111,z

= -2 XY.

But ~P-Y 2 consists of cosine terms only; therefore - 2 XYis the same expression w~th sines in the place of cosines. It will not be necessary to write out the expression for - 2 XY because thCJ coordinate axes will be so taken as to reuder zero the term of JT which contai11s it. To obtain the expression for YZ from that of X 2 - Y 2, change 2 x into x, p 4 into - p 3q, 2 p 2 q2 into pq (p 2 - q2 ), and qi into p q3· Becam;e of the choice of axes, the term of V containing YZ will also disappear. The expression for XZ is obtained from that of YZ by writi11g sines in the place of cosines.

The two terms thus combined may be written
(254)

that is, the term having 2 x - er, + r;:f, for argumeut simply produces a slow variation in the amplitude and period of the predominating one whose argument is 2 x - er, - r;;,. Since 2 I is always less than 15°, the denominator of tan Bis always positive and so R must always lie in the first or fourth quadrant. In X Z occur the terms
(255)

These might be combined into one having x - er, + r;:f 1 as argument, and whose amplitude and period would be subject to slow variations. But as either argument is nearly equal to x - <Y,, it is convenient, as will afterwards appear, to suppose a component of argument x- <Y, having a slowly varying amplitude and period. v\Te are to transform the expression

Tho object of tho transformations (254 ), (261), which may seem theoretically untlcsirublo, is as follows:The numerical harmonic analysis of the tides is made to extend over one year, and this period is not long enough to distinguish completely a title whose argument is 2x - 6, - GJ 11 from one whose argument is 2x - 6, GJ,, nor one whose argument is x-6, - m,, from one whose argument is x-15, m,. In fact, the tide with argnment 2x-61 m, (for which no analysis has been as yet carried out) will only produce an irregulnrity in that of argument 2x-<5,-m,, called tho smaller elliptic semidiurnul tide; su<'h irregularity has in fact been noted, but no explanation has previously bl·cn given of it. Again, the pair of terms with arguments x-cJ, ± m, will appenr in the harmonic analysis with the single argument x- d,, and the resulting numbers will uccessurily appear very irregular, 1111less compared with the theoretical expression (261).

The expression for the tides is written in the form applicable to the equatorial belt hounded by latitudes 26° 34' N. and S. (viz. where sin l=-k i/5). Outsitlcofthis belt. what may be called high tide, will correspond with low water. The clistrilmt.ion oi land on the ea.rth will prohnbl~·. however, serionRly disturb the latitude of evanescent tide. It must be noticed that the y- 6 tide iH comparatively small in the equatorial belt, having at the equator only i of its value in latitude 58·' 54'. Heferring to the schetlnle of theoretical importance,· we see that the tar-diurnal tide M.1 would come in last but four on the list, and the diurnal tide M, (with rigorous speed y- 6) would only be about a lmlf of the synodic fortnightly variational title. It thus appears that the ter-diurnal tide is smaller than Home of the tides not included in our approximation, and that the diurnal tide should certainly he ncgligcable. · The value of the M 1 tide, however, is found witil Hcarcely any trouble, from the numerical analyRis of the tidal observations, and therefore it is proposed that it should still be evaluated.

45. On the mean values of the coefficients. Any of the preceding lunar 1ides may he written in the form

,J cos ( 1'+ u)

(306)

where ,J is a function of 1, and u a function and ,, and t; this may be seen upon referring to Table 1. Now since I is by equations (44) or (49) a. function of w, i, and N, so also is J. The expression (306) when developed will give a term independent of N, which may be written in the form (307) wherein .J1 is the mean value of the semirange in question. It may be proved (see Table 1 and § 2'.!) that in 110 case does J involve a term with a sine of an odd multiple of N, and it may also be shown that in every term of sin u there will occur a sine of an odd muhiple of N; whence it follows that J sin n has mean value zero, and .11 is the term independent of Nin J. cos 11.
It may also be proved that in no case does cos u involve a term in cos N, :ind that the terms iu cos :! }\-"arc all of order;·; also it appears that J always involves a term in cos ,v, and also terms in cos 2 N of order i'. Hence to the degree of approximation a<loptccl, .!, is equal to .r,, cos u,,, where ,T,, is the mean value of .!, a111l cos u.,, the mean ya.Jue of cos u.

47. Table 37 shows the equilibrium amplitudes of several components (disregarding, as usual, the mutual attraction of the fluid) for various latitudes. In order to see what type of tide may belong to a particular latitude, draw the M 2, K 1, and 0 1 waves, with the amplitudes given in the table, upon separate pieces of paper. K, and 0 1 generally conspire for extreme declinations of the moon and interfere when she is near the equator. The resultant K101 wave combined with the M 2 wave will show the diurnal inequality peculiar to the latitude selected. 1lleteorol<>gical tides.-As already stated, there must generally be a tidal component S 1 whose period is a mean solar day; for, the daily variation of the barometer is a well-established fact. At some places the land and sea breezes may also give a component of this speed which, of course, combines with the one answering to the variation of the barometer. In regard to the annual component Sa, it may be said that even if it repeat itself reasonably well at a given place, there is no reason for supposing its curve to be nearly harmonic. Consequently we should expect terms higher than the first to appear in the Fourier series representing it. The semiannual Ssa (partly astronomical and partly meteorological) is the only harmonic tu-<ually worked for. The (equilibrium) argument of Sa is h or the mean longitude of the sun and of Ssa, it is 2 It. These arguments become zero at the time of the vernal equinox; argu111ents of' Sa, Ssa might be so taken as to become zero at the beginning, say, of the calendar year. 48. Overtidcs or shall01c-1cater components.· Let the height of the tide, exclusive of shallow water components, be denoted by y'; let the total height be, as usual, denoted by y.

Let the center of this sheet be placed upon the center of Pither l1emisphere, and place the radiating line of greatest height upon a given terrestrial meridian. The surfaee of the sea is divided by the meridians and parallels into rectangles whose areas are proportional to the cosiues of their latitudes. The volume of the uncorrected equilibrium tide is fouud by mu1tiplying the elementary areas into their respective thicknesses at the given time. 'l'he transparent sheet shows the thick11ess for the assumed time. The volume divided by the area shows how much the (uucorrecte1l) equilibrium spheroid lies above the "corrected" equilibrium spheroid at the assumed component hour. At another hour it will have another valut>, These values tabulated with opposite signs will define a curve drawn once for all for the sea in question, which when added to the (uncorrected) equilibrium curve at any place will give the "corrected" equilibrium tide at that place.

THE HARMONIC ANALYSIS OF TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.

,

ON THE SUMMATION 01" HOURLY OiiDINA'l'ES.

51. In the harmonic analysis it is convenient to consider component days, whose lengths are the periods of the various diurnal components or twice the periods of the semidiurnals. · Such days are divided into twenty-four equal parts called component hours. If the tidal curve be read at the component hours and sums made by combining for each hour all readings belonging to it, twenty-four sums will he obtained. These sums are then analyzed in the manner described in § 58. To avoid tabulating the curve for each kind of component time, the tabulation in mean solar time is made to serve for all. This is done by distributing the (solar) hourly heights among the component hours as nearly as possible. The speeds or periods of the components determine where the various component hours fall upon the solar hours. The manner being always the same for a given component, tables of such correspondences between component and solar hours may be prepared as follows: If we put s 1 = mo for the hourly speed of the mean sun or diurnal :,;olar component, and c1 for the speed of any other diurnal component, then

will represent the portion of any component hour corresponding to a solar hour. While this comparison of component and solar hours is only required to the nearest whole component hour, in order to secure even this degree of approximation throughout the hours of a whole year, it is desir· able to carry the value of ~1 out to about eight decimal places. For all components, zero hour is By successive additions of always taken to coincide with zero hour of the first day of the series.

Iu either case all the solar hours are re.presented by component hours, the maximum diverge11ce being a half component hour. If the maximum divergence allowed be assumed to be a half solar hour, then all solar hours are not represented by component hours when c1 < s1; and when c1 > :0 1 , a solar hour may occasionaJ:y be taken to represent each of two consecutive component hours. The times when the differences between solar and component hours change, are given i11 Table 42, designated "Component hours derived from solar hours." ln this table, the values on the left hand of each colmnn denote mean solllr hours, and those on the right hand show how much the numbering of these hours must be altered in order to obtain the corresponding numbering of the component hours. The component and solar hours, as we have seen, start together with zero hour at the beginning of the series, and, reckoned to the nearest whole component hour, they continue to agree until the first tabular value is reached, when the component hour is the sum or the difference (according to whether a plus or minus sign is used) of the two given values. After this the component hours continue to difter from the solar hours by the first right-hand value until the next tabular value is reached, when the difference becomes that right-hand value, which is to be used until the next given value, and so on. Whenever the value to be added to the solar hour is such that the sum is equal to or exceeds 24, the sum should be diminished by 24; and whenever the solar hour is less than the value to be subtracted from it, increase the solar hour by 2-! before making the subtraction; it is unnecessary to keep track of the component days. For the long period components, where the change during a solar hour is very small, it is proposed to use the daily sums of the hourly lieiglits as the quantities to bu operated upon, and 'l'able 43 shows what component hour each one of the daily sums corresponds to, recko11etl to t!Je 11earest whole component hour. 52. As an example of the use of' Table 42, find the .'.\[ hours 011 the fourth <lay of series correspou<ling to the first five hours of solar time. Entering the table for the tr l Fourth day of aerie·· fourth day of' series antl in the column lh, one sees that, for the second so ar Solar lwnr·. M hour·. hour the difference between solar and M hours is -:J, which difference will 22 0 23 continue from that time until the next taLnlar value; but for that portion of 2 23 the day preceding the second solar hour on the fourth day of series we must 0 look to the tabular value next above, which is -2 at the twenty-first lwur of 4 the second day of series, and as this differe11cc continues until the next tabular value, it is the difference for the first and second 1\I hours requir~d. Th(, resulting M hours are therefore as shown above. It will he noticed that the first and sec'Ond solar hours both correspond to the twenty-third:'.\[ hour; this is due to using whole M hours, as may be seen by m11ltiplying O·!Hi613G8, which is the portion ot' au 1\1 hour corresponding to a solnr hour, by the number of solar hours from the beginning of' the series up to these hours, showing that on the fourth day tlie first solar hour corresponds to 22·53 M hours, while the second solar hour corresponds to 23·49 ::\[hours. Whenever the tlifferenc<> between the solar and. component hour is such that it changes in a iieriod less than a solar day, the table gives two or more columns to the component; hut the above example will suffice to explain the use of the table even in such cases. Having talmlated the component hours wluch "most closely correspond to the solar hours, the hourly heights of any series to be analyzed may be di8tributed iu accordance with this relation. This, however, is a laborious pro<:css, for it not only require~ as many copies of the hourly heights as there a.re component~ sought, but each copy must have its heights arranged differently, according to the relation existing between the liours of the component being worked for and the solar hours, as shown by the table. Instead of using a table, blank forms may be made out once for all indicating where the houriy heights are to be written. Darwi1L in his report for 1883 gives a sample of such form. He has smce prepared and published a set of blank forms for eighteen kinds of summation. Before making a particular summation the hourly heights of the series to be analyzed are to be copied into the form in the way indicated by certain marks thereon. 'l'his method requires as many copies of the hourly heights as there are components to be worked for, hut does away with the mconvenicnce of following a table to find the order of arrangement.

Darwin· has recently devised a set of movable scales for saving labor in distributing the hourly heights for each component; but in matters of simplicity, convenience, cheapness, and rapidity of use, the apparatus does not compare favorably with the stencils described below. 53. Stencils. t This term has been applied to a series ot sheets so perforated as to mechanically indicate what observed hourly heights belong to the various component hours. Their use does away with the necessity of copying or rearranging the tabulated hourly heights. Directions for constriwting stencil.~ for any given component.-Select blank forms similar to those upon which the hourly height to be summed have been tabulated. These forms should be so contrived as to cause the heights to stand sufficiently far apart from one another that uo two of them can ever be seen through the same opening when a stencil is applied; the mere leaving of a large space in which to write each height will not answer, for the heights must be always found in a definite place, which may be designated by light ruled lines. In additio1i1. to the usual way of de11oting the date by the day of the month, it is desirable to use a series of cousecutive numerals, known as "clays of series," which always begin with 1 on the first day of the record used and end so that its last value indicates the number of days taken. The stencil sheets, being intended for use upon any series, have merely the ''days of series" upon them as dates. For the sake of clmtrne8s in using the stencils it has been found desirable to separate the component l10urs into even and odd, thus making two stencil sheets for each page of tabulation, and the sheets which thus constitute a pair must have the same days of series. Having thus prepared blank forms with a duplicate set of days of series, and having written the symbol of the component for which it is designed at the head of each page, turn to the table designated "Component hours derivl·d from solar hours" and in the manner already explained proceed to make the blank forms into a table showing what component hour corresponrls to each solar hour throughout the series, entering the even component hours on one blank and the odd hours on the other. Join those sp:wes containing the Harne component hours by a broken line, and write upon this line, at suitable distances, the number of the component hour it represents. The spaces where the component hours fall are then stamped with a steel punch which makes openings of sufficient size for showing the tabulated 11eights. The accompanying figure shows the first seven days of the even hour of the M stencil. The portions iuclosed with lines represent openings which are cut through the sheet so as to show the tabulated hourly heights to be summed, when the stencil is placed over them. The size of these sheets is governed by the size used in tabulating the hourly heights. The marginal arguments are the solar days of the series and the solar hours, reckoned from midnight. The broken lines joining openings show that the heights appearing through all openings so connected are to be addecl togetlu·r, and each such sum belongs to the 1\1 hour written upon the line. It is generally desirable, particularly in summing for smaller components, to so omit or repeat certai11 hourly heights that each component hour of the period covered receive one, aud but one, hourly height; in other words, to make the maximum divergence between the two kinds of time a half solar, instead of a half component, hour. 'l'o construct stencils suitable for this purpose nse , but repeating the marked the same table as before, omitting the unmarked hours when c<s 1 hours when c1>s 1 . By marked values are meant those pointed out by the arrow, Table 42. Direct-ions for nsing the stcncils.-The stencils are to be applied one sheet at a time to the tabulated hourly heights. Care must be taken to see that the proper sheet is applied in each instance, which iR done by making the <lays of series upon the stencils agree with the corresponding days upon the sheets of hourly heights. 'fhe stencil must be placed carefully so as to accurately coincide with the tabulation beneath it, using paper weights to hold it in posit.ion while making the summations. If a broken line for any component hour runs. out at the top or bottom of the stencil, there will in general be another portion of the same hour on the opposite edge, which should be included in taking tl1e sum. As the hourly heights are summed through the stencil openings for each component hour, the sums are set down in a suitable form having the 24 comp01ll'11t hours and pages of the tabulated heights as arguments. After all the stencils have been applied,

the sums for each component hour on the summation form, are combined into a siugle sum for each of the 24 component hours throughout the period of observation used. The divisors for these final sums are obtained by counting the uumber of openings in the steucils for each component hour; and as a convenience tb.ese di visors may be written, once for all, 011 the left margiu of the stencils, or given in a table. The twenty-four means thus obtained may then be converted into residuals by subtracting from each the mean of all, and these residuals are analyzed in the way explained under harmonic analysis; or, the twenty-four means may be analyzed directly. Sum checks.-Each page of the hourly heights of the sea should be summed horizontally aud vertically before any of the stencils are applied. Any st.encil sum for the whole page (adding together the sums belonging to the odd and even hours) should be the same as the sum of the vertical columns or horizontal lines, provided all hourly heights are used once and but once. But when stencils are constructed with reference to the marked values of Table .42 an additional or third stencil sheet should accompany each pair which will point out the hourly heights omitted or used twice according as c, ;:: s. The sum obtained uy aid of this sheet must be added to or subtracted from the total sum obtained from the even and odd hour sheets in order to check the work. For a component like K, P, H., or T, whose speed differs little from that of S, lines joining the openings will frequently become horizontal. When this bappens openings slwuld be made in the right-hand margin of the stencil sheets, so that the horizontal sums already made may be simply copied upon the proper component hours. In this connection see § 66. 54. Adding machines. Several varieties of adding machines are used by the Survey in making these and other summations, viz., the "0omptometer" a11d the "0omptograph," manufactured by the Felt & Tarrant Manufacturing Company, Chicago, Ill.; the" Burroughs Registering Accountant," by the American Arithmometer Company, St. Louis, Mo., and a computing machine made by A. Burkhardt, Glasshiitte, Germany. The machine last mentioned is designed more especially for multiplication and division. 55. A proposed machine for obtaining component sums. Having seen that the stencils mechanically point out where the hourly values must go in making up the partial sums, the idea naturally suggests itself of having the equivalent of stencils so control a registering apparatus as to simultaneously give all the required summations. Let there be as many cylinders-each, say, 26 inches long and 10 inches in diameter-as there are indepeudeat summations to be made. Bach cylinder will represent the stencil of a single component for, say, 370 days. The circumforence of each cylinder should be divided into 370 equal parts, each division fixing a line or element which represents a day. All cylinders are supposed to have a common movement in the direction of their axes an inch or so in extent for bringing tbe hole!:! about to be mentioned, into their propor positions for the various hours of the day. Each day line contains 24 l1oles in the surface of the cylinder, determined by the correspondence between solar and component hours for the day in question, the small movement along the axis having been taken into account. The recording or adding apparatus for each kind of summation consists of two series of tootbed wheels, all wheels of a series being upon a common shaft. The number of teeth upou each wheel of the first series may be taken as 300, and of the second series 299. The number of wheels in each series is 2·>, one for each component liour and one for those few bourly heights which are used only in checking the sums of the 24 partial sums. The number of revolutions made by the 300-tooth wheels can be found by subtracting the readings of the 300 tooth wheels from the readings of the 299-tooth wheels. The part!! of revolutions are, of course, the direct readings. The cylinders are placed side by side in a horizontal frame, all axes being parallel. This frame is supported by a table or framework and is capable of the small amount of motion already referred to. AU cylinders are made to rotate together by means of a rack and spur wheels. Above these cyliuders, or above the interveuiug spaces, the two sets of toothed wheels serving as counters are mounted. The shafts bearing the 300-tooth wheels can all be made to rotate the same amount by means of parallel rods and cranks. The operator imparts motion to the mechanism by means of a crank at one end of the framework. This carries a pointer which,

541

moving over a graduated dial, indicates the amount of its rotation and of tbe 300-tooth wheels, which are not held fast by the levers about to be mentioned; that is, it indicates what number or hourly height is being entered. The crank can be released and returned to its initial position without causing any of the shafts to rotate. The cylinders control the 300-tooth wheels by means of levers, one for each wheel. The 25 levers for each component are upon a common axis parallel to the axis of the cylinder. At one end of each lever is a needle-like projection for entering the perforations in the surface of the cylinder, while at the other end is a sharp edge, extending upward, for engaging the wheel above, thereby preventing its rotation. Since the preventing of a wheel from revolving with its shaft must give rise to friction and wear, it seems best to stop but one out of each 25 rather than to stop 24 of tliem. This involves no extra work on the part of the operator except the subtracting of the final machine readings from a constant number-the grand total of all hourly heights. For each succeeding day, the cylinders are all turned forward one notch; and for each succeeding hour of the day, they are all carried forward automatically a small but constant amount along the line of their axes. As already intimated, the hourly heights when entered once are to be simultaneously summed in all the kinds of summations required in analysis, thus enabling a person to sum for all components almost as quickly as he now sums for one upon an ordinary adding machine. This machine is designed to take the place of an harmonic analyzer in tillal work. Its merits are its positive workings, the great number of components which can l>e included, and its simplicity of construction, in tliat hundreds of its parts are exactly alike. 56.

So on for all the other components. Since the speed ratios a, b, c a.re constant, and since y is the same in all integrals, it becomes possible to evaluate all integrals-simultaneously by having an integrator for each coefficient H 0 , .A, X, B, B, O, V, etc. In fact, the friction wheel in each will be displaced from the center of the disk the same amount at any given instant of time, and . suitable gears can be provided for imparting angular velocities proportional to a., b, c, etc., while the harmonic or reciprocating motion can in each case be obtained by means of a pin working in a slot perpendicular to the required motion. The rectilinear harmonic motion is converted into circular harmonic by means of a rack and toothed sector. The disk, globe, and cylinder integrator, the invention of Prof. James Thomson, has as its peculiar merit, the avoiding of the sliding motion of the friction wheel along the diameter of the disk.· A sphere replaces the friction wheel. It is moved outward and inward along a diameter of the disk by means of a forked guide. The motion to be recorded is that which takes place perpendicularly to the radii of the disk; it is indicated by the number of revolutions of a cylinder turned by the sphere. The disk is inclined to the horizontal at an angle of about 450; the recording cylinder turns freely upon its axis which is parallel to the plane of the disk. The sphere by its own weight crowds against the disk aud ~ylinder. As it rolls along a diameter of the disk and au element of the cylinder, its center describes a straight line parallel to the axis of the cylinder. The ordinate of the curve shows how far the ball is to be moved. A series of these integrators properly connected constitute the Thomson harmonic analyzer. They are arranged in a horizontal row. The point which follows the tide curve as the marigram is passed over a cylinder is fixed on a long horizontal rod. The rod has as many fork-like projections for moving the balls as there are integrators in the machine.

If -r be a solar hour, as is the case when each component hour of the observation perioll receives one and but one hourly height, the augmenting factors for the various components differ somewhat from one another, the difference depending upon the difference of speed. Their values are given in Table 38. If 48 half-hourly heights be tabulated each day, and if the 24 component hours be scattered among these 48 times as nearly as possible in constructing the stencils or making the summation, then -r =!solar hour in the expression (401) for the augmenting factor.

according to the usual rule.· Then(§ 27) because the average value of tbe sine or cosine of an angle successively falling on all parts of the circumference is zero, and that of (sin) 2 or (cos) 2 equal to~. the normal equations reduce to equations (406) above. The form "Harmonic analysis of tides," § 61, is for facilitating the work indicated by these normal equations. In the form, c1, s 1 are written instead of .A. 1, A1 ; c.i, s2 instead of .A. 2, A2 ; and so on, because upon that sheet it is not necessary to have the symbol designate the component in any way, and so the same form answers for all components. The following symbols without subscripts apply to any component. But when it is desired to distinguish between diurnals and semttliurnals, for instance, the symbols take the subscripts 1and2. n denotes the speed of any component. V + u are together the whole argument of the partial tide according to the equilibrium theory; · i. e., V + u is the phase of such tide provided its interval x/n happens to be zero. V is the portion of V + u varying uniformly with the time. - r;, is the initial phase of the component ticle; i. e., the phase when t = O. C/n is tho time which must elapse between the beginning of the series and the first high water of the partial tide. x/n is tho interval or time between tho action of the assumed cause of the partial tide and the occurrence of its high water. " is the interval expressed in degrees; it denotes tho hour angle of the fictitious moon,§ 24, at tho time of high water of the partial tide. H is the mean value of the amplitude of any partial tide.

It is assumed that the diurnals when analyzed are free from the semidiurnals, quarter diurnals, etc.; similarly, that the semidiurnals are free from diurnals, quarter diurnals, etc. The amount of disturbance in a diurnal component due to another diurnal, is supposed to depend upon the length of the series and the difference in the initial phases of the two waves; similarly for any two semidiurnals. Jf the initial phases were each taken into account, instead of the difference merely, an additional argument wou Id be required in the tabulation of the corrections; !Jut it is only necessary to make analyses of hourly sums cut off at various places, in order to convince one's self that the additional argument is wholly unnecessary for a sei'les a mouth or more in length.

Comparison between results obtained by using all hourly heights and those obtained by so using the hourly heights that the successive component hours are represented once and only once-in other words, paying attention to the arrows in Table 42. There can be no reasonable doubt but that greater accuracy is generally attained by following the second of these two modes of procedure. Usually the difference of the results will be small, especially in the case of the predominating component. However, at most places one or more of the other components are a considerable fraction of M2 and so M 4 and l\'.16 may be sensibly affected by the putting of two heights now and then upon the same component hour. The following is a good· example of this, since at Port Townsend K, is even larger than M2 , Tbe differences between the two sets of results for the month at Sitka are not great, but they . show that some accuracy is gained by paying attention to the arrows in Table 42.

n a week's time, which is the time covered by each page of tabulated hourly heights. (See § 61.) Suppose a page of such heights to be summed with the A stencil. These sums may beregarded as a series of 24 component (A) hourly heights falling on and among the 24 hours of the middle,

or fourtl1, day of the week. Ilad the B stencil been used instead, the B sums might likewise have been regarded as a series of 24 component (B) hourly height.a falling on aud among the 24 hours of the fourth day. In fact such times would have been the times of occurrence of the B hours of that day, reckoned from the beginning of the series. A comparison of the (solar) times of the several A sums with the (solar) times of the occurrence of the B hours will show what B hour each A sum lies nearest to. Therefore if the 24 A sums be copied into a form one argument of which is the week or page and the other the hours from 0 to 23, it is very easy to construct a secondary stencil· which shall sort the A sums accordiug to the B hours. Since it is assumed that one page is given to each week of hourly heights, the number of pages to be summed in a year's series is G2 or u:t The partial or seven-day sums for a year can be conveniently written upon about 7 pages; and this is the number of pages which have to be summed with the secondary stencil. If complete stencils be used for the first row of components, secondary stencils may be applied to the resulting partial sums, and abbreviated summations obtained for the components written underneath :

This abbreviation of the work has its principal advantages in the case of a long series of observations; for, the irregularities introduced thereby gradually disappear, and, of course, the amount of lab~r saved in summation is about proportional to the time covered by the series. In analyzing the B sums obtained by aid of the secondary stencils, the A augmenting factor should be applied because the first summation was according to A time while the observations are in solar time. Another augmenting factor is required because the secondary stencils are constructed with reference to B time. The reason for this can be readily seen if to the S sums we apply a secondary K stencil for obtaining the component K. Clearly the S sums do not fit the K hours; they may diverge as much as half of a K hour when all the S sums are used, and used

once, or half of an S hour when each K hour bas one, and only one, partial S sum assigned to it. In either case the K augmenting factor can l>e used, because the speed of K is very nearly but not exactly 15° per hour. Another way of lessening the labor of summation is to use either bi.hourly ordinates or the hourly heights combined in pairs. Such combination can be made, once for all, upon the houl'lyordinate sheets. On the harmonic analysis of tides of long period. 67. The principal tides of loug period are: The lunar fortnightly, l\lf, period ~ tropical month; the luni-solar fortnightly, MSf, period ~ synodic ruontli; tlie lunar monthly, Mm, period 1 auomalistic month; the annual, Sa, and the semiannual, Ssa. In the treatment of these components it is convenient to make use of the daily sums (or means) · of the hourly heights, distributing them in accordanee with the annual all(I the several montlily periods. That is to say, the various months aml the year are each supposed to l>e divided into 24 equal parts analogous tO the subdivision of the day, so that the entire time covered by the observations can be divided up with reference to such periods autl their twenty-fourth parts and the position of each daily sum with respect to them be determiued. These sums, however taken, will belong to a certain hour of the day. We shall suppose, as usual, that the hourly heights belonging to 0 11 , 11i, 21i . · . 231i, are simply added together, thus making the sum pertain to Uh 3;im a. m. of each day. Table 43 shows where each daily sum falls for the four kinds of distribution here contemplated. Suppose the length of series used to be four years, or 1,461 days. It contains 106·95 periods of Mf; 98·95 periods of MSf; 53·02 periods of Mm; 4 periods of Sa, and 8 periods of Ssa. All of these numbers are integers, or very nearly integers. It would seem, therefore, that the daily heights, when once purified of the short-period tides, might be summed and analyzed according to the methods employed with the hourly heiglits for tides of short period. Moreover, for a series four years in length it seems probable that no elimination on account of the disturbing effects of these components upon one another will be necessary. It is here proposed to use the uncorrected daily sums or means. The component Si is completely eliminated from each daily sum~ K 1 and K 2 are very nearly eliminated, because the K day is very nearly equal to the S day. N 2 and 0 1 have considerable effects upon the daily sums; but since their synodic periods with 8 2 and S 1 are not commensurable with any of the long-period components sought, the latter cannot, in the long run, be greatly disturbed by the long-period waves which are due to N 2 and 0 1· 1\12 has a direct effect upon :MSf, which it is necessary to determine. Let £ denote the wave, whose speed is equal to the speed of MSf, dne to tl1e imperfect elimination of M 2 from the daily sums or means. Then by (440) its amplitude is tho numerical value of 24 or using (442),

For a method of determining the annual, the semiannual, and ~ther tides of very long period, see § 28, Part Ill. 68. 1'1.te following treatment of long-period tides is ta.ken bodily from Darwin's 1883 report. It supposes the time to be reckoned from noon instead of midnight, and the series to extend over a period of one year. Darwin has prepared and published special forms· for the reduction of these tides. Iieference may also be made to Baird's l\Iauual, pages 41, 52-54.
For the purpose of determining those tides we have to climinnto tho oscillations of water-level arising from the tides of short 1ieriod. As tho quickest of these tides has a period of rnauy days, tho height of mean water at one instant for each day giv<'B sufficient data. Th.us there will in a ~·ear's observations bo 3G5 heights to be submitted to harmonic analyi;is. In leap-years the last day's observation must be dropped, because the treatment is adapted for analysing 365 values. To find tho daily moan for any day it lrnH hitherto been usual to take the arithmetic moan of 24 consecutin1 hourly values, beginning with the height at noon. This height will thou apply to tho middle instant of the period from 0 11 to 23": that iH to say, to 11 11 30"' at 11ight. Wo shall propose some now modes of treating tho observations, and in the first of them it will probably ho more convenient that the moan for the day Rhould apply to midnight instead of to 11" 30"'. For finding a mean applicahle to midnight we take the 25 consceutiYe heights for Oh to U", and add the half of tho first value to the 23 intermediate a111l to the half of the Inst and divide by 2-1. It would probably be sufficiently accurate if we took ¥16 of the sum of the 25 co11socutive Yalues, if it is found that the diYision of every 24th hourly value into two halves materially increases the labour of computing the daily means.

Major Bair1l considers that the use of ruetho1l (i) iH most convenient for the computers.

It was found practically in the computation for these tides that only three tides of short period exercise an appreciable effect, so that clearances for them have to be applied. These tides aro the M., N, 0 tides. It was usual to compute thcso three clearances for every day in the year, and to correct the daily valnes accordingly. But in following this plan a great deal of unnecessary labour has been incurred, and when a simpler plan is followed it may perhaps be worth while to include moro of the short-period tidos in the clearances. Professor J.C. Adams suggests the use of the tide-predicting machine for the evaluation of tho sum of the clearances, and if this plan is not found to inconveniently dolay operations in India, it may perhaps be tried. In explaining the process we will suppose that method (i) has been followed; if either of the other plans be adopted it will be easy to change the formulro accordingly. It is clear that R cos (a+ 11! n) is the height of the tide n at llh sum; and the same is true for each such tide. Hence if we use the tide-predicter to run off a year of fictitious tides with the semi-range of each tide equal to sin 12 n/sin t n of its true semi-range, and with all the solar series an<l the annual and semi-annual tides put at zero, the height given at each 11 11 30m in the year is the sum for each day of all the clearances to be subtracted. The scale to which the ranges are set may of course be chosen so as to give the clearances to a high degree of accuracy. In the other process of clearance, which will be explained below, a single correction for each short-period tide is applied to each of the final equations, instead of to oach daily mean. We next take the 365 daily means, -and find their mean value. This gives the mean height of water for the year. If the daily means be uncleared, the result can not be sensibly vitiated. We next subtract the moan height from each of the 365 values, and find 365 quantities 6h giving the daily height of water above tho mean height. These quantities are to be the subject of the harmonic analysis; and the tides chosen for evaluation are those which havo been denoted above as Mm, Mf, MSf, Sa, Ssa.

If the daily moans have been cleared by the use of the tide-predictor as above described, these ten equations are to be solved by successive approximation, and we are then furnished with the two component semiamplitudes, say .A,, B, of the five long-period tides. But the initial instant of time is the first llh 30m in the year instead of the first noon. Hence if as before we put R· = A1· + B,·, and tan C 1 = B1/ A1, we must, in order to roduco the results to the normal form in which noon of the first day is the initial instant of time, add to C 1 the increment of the corresponding argument for llh 30 111 , according to method (i), or for 12 hours according to methods (ii) or (iii). 69. If, however, the daily moans havo not been cleared, then before solution of the final equations corrections for clearance will have to be applied, which we she.II now proceed to evaluate. For this process we still suppose method (i) to be adopted.

Let n be the speed of a short-period tide in degrees l>er m. s. hour, and let 'l/J (n) =-ht~~ ~

For the clearance of tho five Jong-period tides from the effects of the three tides l\lo, N, O, it will be necessary to compute 60 cocflici<·nts. If it shall ho found convenient to make the initial instant or epoch for tho tides of long period different from that chosen in tho reductions of those of Hhort period, it will, of course, be necessary to compute the values which A and U would have had if thn two epochs had been identical. A and B are, of course, the component semi-ranges of the title of abort period :it the epoch chosen for t.be titles of long period; to determine them it ie necessary to multiply R by the cm~ino az11l sine of V 11-u at the epoch.

It may happen from time to tinlll that thll tide-gaug" breaks down for a fow days, from the stoppage of tho clock, the choking of the tnhe, or somll other such accident. In this cuse there will boa hiatus in the values of oh. Now, the whole process employed <lep!l1Hls on tho existence of 365 continuous values of oh. Unless, therefore, tho year's obser,·ations are to be sacrificed, this hint.us must be filled. If not mor<i than throe or four days' observations are wanting, it will be bllst to plot out the vnlulls of oh graphically on each side of the hiatus, and filling in thll gap with a curve drawn by hancl, use the values of olt gi\·en liy thll conjectural curve. If the gap is somewhat longer, several plans may be snggeste<l, and judgment .must be usecl as to which of them is to be adopted. If there is another station of observation in the llllighborhoocl, tho values of oh for that station may be insort!ld. . Tll!l values of oh fbr another part of the year, in which the moon's and sun's declinations are as nearly as may be the same as they worn 1luring the gap, may be used. It may bo, however, that tho hiatus is of considemble length, so that the prec!lding methods are innpplicablo: as when iu 1882 the tidal rllcord for Vi:11agapatam is wanting for 67 days The following method of treatment will then bo applica blu :Wo find approximate values of tho tidal constituents of long period, aml fill in the hiatus, so as to complete tho 365 values, with tho computed height of the ti<lll during the hiatus. To find these approximittll values Wll form :Eoh cos It und ":Eo It sin 1t for the days of observation; next, in the ton finul equations of Schedule P we neglect all tho terms with small coefficients, and iu tho terms whoso coefficients are approximately 182·5, we substitute u coofllcient equal to 182·5 diminished by half tho number of days of hiatus. For example, for Vizagapatam in 1882 wo have 182·5-~ x 67=149, aml, o. g., :::Eoh cos (o'-ro) t=l4!JA approximately. After tho approximate values of A, ll, C, D, &c., have been found, it is easy to find the approximate height of tide for the days of the hiatus. This plan will also apply where the hiatus is of short duration. It may be pursued whether or not wo are working with cleared daily means; for if the daily means are uncleared, as will henceforth be tho case, we import with the numbers by which the hiatus is filled exactly those fictitious tides of long period which are cleared away by the use of tho "clearance coefficients," in preparing the ton final equations for solution. · Other methods of treating a stoppage of tho record may be devised. If the stoppage be near t11e beginning of tho year, or near the end, we may nogloct tho observations l>oforo or after tho gap, aud compute nfresh the 100 coefficients of Schedule P, and the cloarancll coefficients of Schedule Q for the number of days remaining. If tho gap is in the middle we might compute the values of the coefficients of Schedules P and Q as though tho days of hiatus wore days of obsorvat.ion, benring in mind that tho formulm are to be altered by the consideration that time is to bo measured from the initial llh 30m of the year, Instead of from tho initial llh 30"' of tho days of hiatus. The so computed coefficients are then to be subtracted from the values given in Schedules P and Q, and the amended final equations and amended clearance coefficients to be used. , It must _remain a matter of judgment as to which of these various methods is to bo adopted in each ease. 70. Mt!thod pf Equivalent 1lfultiplio1·s for tlie Harmonio A11alysis for tho Tides of Long Period.. Up to the present time tho harmonic unulysis for these ticles has been conducted on a plan which seems to involve a great deal of unn!lcessary Iabour. If l be thll speed of uny one of the five tides for which the analysis has been carried out, in degrees per m. s. day, tho values ol cos It and 11in lt have been computed fort= O, I, 2 364, so that there are 730 values for each of the five tides. Those 730 values have then been multiplied by tho 365 oll.'s corresponding to eallh value of t, and tho summations gave :::Eoh cos It and ":Eoh sin lt, the numerical results being thll left-hand sides of one pair of the ten final equations explained in ~ 68. Now, it appears that this labour may be largely abridged, without nny substantial loss of accuracy. The plan proposed by ~rofeesor Adams is that of equivalent multipliers. The values of cos lt may be dh·ided into eleven groups, according as they fall nearest to 1 ·0, ·9, ·8, ·7 ·2, ·1, 0. Then, as all the values of oh are to be multiplied by some vahrn of cos lt, and that value of cos It must fall into one of these groups, we collect together all the values of oh which belong to one of these groups, sum them, and multiply tho sum by thll corresponding multiplier, l·O, ·9, ·8, &c., as tho case may be. Since there are as many values of cos It which are negative as positive, we must change the sign of half of tho oil's. This changing of Rign may be effected mechanically as follows :-In the spaces for entry of tho oh's, thoMe o/t's whose sign is to ho unchanged 11.ro to bo entered Oil the left side of·tbo space if positive, and to tho right if negative; when the sign is to be altered this order of entry is to be reversed. Thus in the column corro8pouding to ouch multiplier wo sh.all have two sub-columns, on tho left all the oll's which, when tho signs are appropriately nltorod, are+, and on the right those which are-. Tho sub-columns are t.o bo soparatllly summed, and their differm1ce gives tho tot1il of tho column, which is to b!l mnltipliecl by the multiplier appropriate to tho column. The treatm!lut for the formation of ":Eoh sin lt is precisely similar. Tho annexocl form [Scho<lnlo HJ ill designed for entry for detormiuation of ":Eoh cos (o'-11) t. Tho entries of oh are to be made continuously in tho marked squares from left to right, and hack again from right to loft. Tho numbers in the squaros, which in t.ho llOlllJlutatiou forms are to b!l printed small and put in the corner, indicate the days of observation. Tho roWH are nrrango<l in sots of four corresponding to oaeh complete period of 2(6-77). In tho mi<ldle pair for oach period tho+ vuluos of oh are to be written on thn ri .. ht and in the rest on tho left. Tho word 'change' oppo8ite half the rows is to show the computer that ho is to ch"'an~e tho mode of on try. Each column, excepting thnt for zero, is to be summed at the foot of the page, an cl multiplied by the multiplier corresponding to its column. A llair of forms is required for onoh tide of long period; they are very easily prepare<! from the llxistiug forms, in which the vnlues of tho multipliers are already computed.

71. To 1·eproduce the quantities harmonically analyzed. Having analyzed a set of partial or hour sums and determined the e's and s's, or R's and ('s, it is sometimes desirable to recombine the partial tides of the analysis sheet into a resultant curve in order to see bow this curve compares with the curve obtained by plotting the hour sums; or it may be done for other purposes. The nature of the case will suggest how many of the harmonics should be retained. The same process is applicable to inequality curves, certain constants having been found from the analysis of the heights or intervals involving the particular inequality in question. (See§ 54, Part I.) The accompanying form will show how this combination may be made.

Now Table 3 gives Vii+ 11 0 or arg, for Greenwich midnight, while the al)Ove equation supposes it to· IJelong to meridian of San FranciGco and the time to be local.

The epochs modified once for all are respectively.

years,

If, however, before beginning the summation we subtract~ Mn from all high-water heights and add ~ Mn to all low-water heights, the necessity for keeping count of the number of highs and lows will be avoided and the same result obtained as before. If the high and low water heights be tabulated upon hourly ordinate forms, and summations made with the K and 0 stencils even for a very long period, there is no guaranty that tbe effect of M2 will be totally eliminated, although it will be nearly so. To understand this, suppose that at the given station the tropic diurnal inequality be great in low-water heights but small in the high-water heights; also, suppose that observations be confined to high waters. Now if these heights be tabulated in their proper places upon the hourly ordinate sheets and the K stencil applied to them, it is clear that an amplitude much too small will be obtained for K 1· In other words, M2 will have a pronounced effect upon the result. If, now, lows as well as highs be included in the observations, the effect of M2 upon a diurnal tide will be very much diminished; but there is no reason to suppose that it will ever disappear completely, however long the series. Wl1ile it is possible to distribute high and low water heights or times according to known arguments and obtain consistent results for a given station, serious difficulties arise when an attempt is made to interpret tlie results in terms of the harmonic constants or to accurately obtain these constants by any prescribed distributions. For instance, the phase inequality in the range of tide is not a simple harmonic increase and de~rease of the range even if µ 2 be ignored. Its unsymmetrical character caq readily be seen by referring to Table 16. The parallax and declinational inequalities are even more complicated than that of phase, as is pointed out in §§ 4G, 47 of Part III. Having called attention to some of the difficulties encountered in the harmonic analysis of high and low water observations, we pass to a more thorough and systematic procedure. For convenience, the whole work of making the analysis may be divided into six steps or operations: (1) Making a ''first reduction." (2) Finding the mean amplitudes and the time occurrence of the mean ranges using fou.r consecutive tides. (3) Obtaining hourly ordinates from these amplitudes by aid of a system of sine curves drawn upon a transparent sheet. (4) Summing these ordinates with semidiurnal stencils and analyzing the partial sums. (5) Diminishing the heights of the tides by the ordinates belonging to the times of the tides, and tabulating the heights thus altered upon hourly ordinate forms. (6) Summing these values with diurnal stencils, and analyzing the partial sums. (1') The process of making a "first reduction" is fully described in § 51, Part I, and§ 27, Part ID. The epoch of M2 is found from the I uni tidal intervals by aid of this last-named paragraph; the amplitude, from the observed mean range of tide by aid of Tables 23 and 14. Where there is much difference between the duration of rise and of fall, the amplitude of M2 as determiaed from the range must be affected with M4. To correct for this, divide the M2 as obtained above by the quantity · cos v + sin 2 1' x it (duration fall ~ 6"·21) (495) where v =(duration fall......, G"·21) x 140.492,

(2') lu the accompanying tabulation the last column sho~vs the values of the successive mean amplitudes; the fifth, the times of' occurrence of the ranges; and the sixth, their duration which is G·21 hours on au average. The values iuclosed in parentheses involve observations prior to July 1; generally they would have been simply inferred from succeeding values.

(3'). To prepare for interpolatiilg hourly ordinates from the successive ranges, first select a cross-section paper whose smallest divisions are about -/6 inch square. J.,et an hour of time cover an inch or more, and let a foot of tide, when convenient, correspond to an inch on the sheet. Along the uppel:' margin of the sheet number the hours from 0 to 24, or O, and thence on to 12, making 36 hours represented. On a sheet of tracing cloth lay out a rectangle, say 10 inches high and long enough to represent 6 lunar, or 6·21 solar, hours. The center of this rectangle is the 11ode of a. system of, say, 10 sine curves whose amplitudes vary from 0 to 5 inches, and are numbered, if convenient, from 0 to 5. .A.II curves extend over a half period or G·21 hours. To interpolate hourly heights, place the node of the sine curves at the time of occurre'nce of a semidiurnal range given in the fifth column of the above tabulation. Select the curve having a number equivalent to the mean amplitu<le at the time given in the last column. Read the heights at the points where tbis curve crosses the hour lines. 'rhese are the required hourly 11eights reckoned from mean water level. So proceed with each range. If the tide have a very large phase ine<1uality, causing the quarter tidal day to depart much from a quarter lunar day, or 6·21 hours, this fact may be taken

into consideration by reading ono or two of the hourly heights on either side of the node as before, and the hourly heights near the times of maxima and minima, when the edges of the rectangle have been ma(le to fall exactly half way between the times given in the fifth column; or more than one permanent set of curves may be used. Probably this refinement is unnecessary.

· (4') Before summing with the semidinrual stencils, the hourly heights Hhould have a constant added to them in order to avoid negative quantities; in the accompanying tabulation G foet has been a<l<leu. The summation and analysis are then to be carried out as in the case of true hourly ordinates. (5') The values of the semidiurnal ordinates referred to mean water level are now known for each hour; they are therefore known for the times of the true high and low wnters. Subtracting the appropriate semidiurual ordinates, we have four heights per lunar <lay which lie upon the diurnal curve, very nearly. (G') The diurnal heights are then summed with the stencils, and analyzed for K 1 and 01 in the usual way excepting that the augmenting factors 1 ·00!.!87 and 1 ·00:!49 are to be used twice instead of once. When the series is very short, and so the divisors generally quite unequnl, it may be advisable to write each height of the tide twice, i. e., to regard it as the hourly ordinate immediately preceding and immediately following the time of tide. Below is appended the results obtained from analyzing a series of tidal observations one month i11 exteut. They show how the results obtained from high and low waters agree with the results obtained from regular hourly readiugs. Usiug the notation of §§ 5D, ().!, the uucorrecte(l amplitudes anu angles are really the R/s and t;/s, since 110 corrections have been applied to them on account of the disturbing components.

If the diurnal inequality is considerable, any process of interpolation is rather laborious and not always accurate, even where the shallow water components are small, because the period of the diurnal wave is not generally exactly twice that of the semidiurnal. The range of the diurnal wave Is, approximately, (497) The high-water inequality is found by subtracting a given high-water height f~om the mean of the two adjacent high-water heights.

These data, with Table rn, enable one to find the position of the diurnal wave with respect to the semidiurnal, also the value of L11. l{ules for determining the quadrant of the rrw phase of the diurnal wave, i. e., the angle or phase of tl~e diurnal at the time of rrw of the semidiurnal, are as follows: Sequence llHW to LL W

76. Remarks upon p1tblished results and tables. The effects of the motion of the moon's node upon the amplitudes and epochs of the components, as brought out by the harmonic analysis, were not allowed for in the earlier published results. Consequently, determinations from successive years were not inter se comparable. In this connection see the British Association l~eports, 1878, p. 481, note, and 1883, p. 91. Ferrel corrected the components ~'1 2 , K 2, K 1 , and 0 1for such effects, but omitted the corrections for the other components similarly affected. His tables for this purpose are given upon page 304 of the Survey Report for 1878. It is to be noted that the numerical values of his .dE's for K 1 , M2, and K 2 have the wrong signs prefixed; he seems, however, to have always corrected this in making analyses. Initial equilibrium arguments.-In the Survey Report for 1878, Ferrel uses c, and in the Report , for 1883 he uses k, to denote V0 , or the uniformly varying portion of Vo+ u. The k's (or e's) ofK1 K 2, and l 2, and perhaps others, are sometimes wrong by 90° or 180°. To ascertain this, compare the k's (or e's), l{eport for 1878, pages 270, 303, and for 1883, page 267, with the Yo+ u of Table 3. A leap year is not so convenient as a common year for this purpose, because the k's then refer to the 2d instead of the 1st of January. The smaller discrepancies shown by such comparison are due to the u of Table 1. That is

V0 +

le= u = -

oc· or + L1E, t very nearly.

(501)

In this manual the origin of the day is taken as midnight. Oonsequently, unless otherwise stated, V 0 refers to midnight instead of noon as contemplated by the British Tidal Committee. In Tables 1 and 3 the initial equilibrium argument of ~ is in error by 180°. E. Roberts has noted that the lower half of Table 8 has been incorrectly formed from the upper half. The tabular values will still hold good if for (P = ) 950, 100°, 1050, etc., there be substituted 1750, 1700, 1650, etc.

Harmonic analysis of tidal currents. The height of the tide or the vertical displaceme:.J.t of the surface of the sea at a given point is usually assumed to have for its expression

In a canal of indefinite length it would be reasonable (according to § 22, Part I) to assume the horizontal displacement (e) to be of the above form, sa.ve that. sines take the place of cosines, and that the amplitudes are the above amplitudes all multiplied by the same constant. The velocity of the current is d~ /dt, an expression involving cosines instead of sines, and having the horizontal displacement amplitudes multiplied by the respective speeds. This shows that a diurnal component of the velocity is only about one· half as great as a semidiurnal when the two corresponding tidal components, or partial tides, are equal. On the other hand, the quarter diurnals and the sixth diurnals have a tendency to become more prououuced in the velocity. The theoretical ratio between two velocity amplitudes is not the same as the theoretical ratios between the two corresponding tidal coefficients, even though both partial tides are diurnal or both semidiurnal; but this ratio must be multiplied by the speed ratio.

It is here supposed that we have hourly observations upon the velocity and direction of the current extending over one· or more months. These velocities can be re'lolved with reference to two fixed directions-say, north and east. The velocities may be denoted by the letters used to denote the partial tides, each with a dot written above each: e.g., .M:2 , 82, N2. The resolved portions may be distinguished by the subscripts n, e, s, or w, according to the direction-north, east, south, or west-to wllich they refer. Tlle resolution of the velocities into two portions is readily effected by aid of a circle drawn upon cross-section paper and divided into degrees, together with a scale whose zero is at the center of the circle and whose straight edge always falls upon a radius. The summations and analyses are made in the same manner as for the partial tides, because the velocity in a given direction (north, say) is assumed to be written

If a directi<;m indicated by the subscript approximately coincides with the direction of flood, then for long tidal rivers we should expect l\f2 ° to be approximately equal to M 2°; but for a small bay or harbor it should be nearer M 2o- 900. If the direction indicated by the subscript approximately coincides with the direction of the ebb, M:2 0 should be approximately equal to M2 ° ::!:: 180° for a long tidal river and M 2° + 900 for a small bay or harbor. The same statements hold true when M2 is replaced by 8 2, N 2, K 1, etc. In tidal rivers or in straits the currents have a nearly fixed line of motion, and so it is hardly necessary to decompose the velocities into two parts, as indicated above. 78. To combine the various current components for any given future time. Combine, as in § 72, all partial north-and-south currents; likewise combine all partial eastand-west currents. With the two velocities thus obtained a rectangle of velocities can be constructed whose diagonal represents the direction and velocity of the total current.

Prediction of currents.-Suppose all partial north-and-south currents to have been properly combined, and a curve drawn representing the result from hour to hour. A tide predictor which traces a continuous curve can be used for this purpose and so the labor of computation be avoided. Suppose the partial east-and-west currents to have been similarly combined and a

curve drawn. Let the two curves be i>laced side l>y side. At a.uy given instant the direction and velocity of the total current become known upon constructing a rectangle of velocities by aid of the two curves. The time of minimum velocity can l>e found either by trial or directly by the following process: Upon glancing at the t.wo curves the approximate time of minimum velocity can be found; it will generally lie near the point where the curve of greater amplitude crosses its axis. A straight line can be drawn closely coinciding with this curve for some distance either way from the assumed time of minimum velocity. Another straight line can be drawn nearly coinciding with the other curve for the time in question. The question then reduces to the simple geometrical problem (which has an application in § 36, Part Ill): In a plane are given two straight lines referred to rectangular coordinates; it is required to find geometrically an abscissa such that the sum of the squares of the two corresponding ordinates shall be a minimum. Suppose the equation (505) y = m.v

to represent the line having the greater inclination to tlie x-axis and the equation

x
the other line. When

a

(507)

the sum of the squares of the two y's becomes a minimum. The problem may now b~ stated: Given a., b, and m, to find x geometrically. J,et 00 and AB denote the given lines; draw AG parallel to the y-axis and lay oft' AD= BO= b. Bisect AO, thus determining E; then with _E as center and OD as radius, describe an arc FGH. Draw BG parallel to the x-axis; take GH = FG and draw the line EHI. Take EI= EO =~a and project I upon the x-axis in J: then is OJ the requireQ. abscissa. 7!:J. R1tles governing the choice between Roman andJtalic letters in tidal work. Considerable confusion having already arisen among writers upon tides in regard to the nota. tion employed, it has been thought best to here state certain rules which have been generally followed in this manual. Homan letters are used to denotelst. Quantities which are in themselves particular or definite tidal quantities at a given , 82, 8 2°, Mn, HWI. station. E.g., M2, M0 2 2d. Defi11ite quantities intimately connected or associated with those of the kind just referred to. E. g., m2, s2, meaniug speeds; M, 8, denoting particular series of lunar and solar tides. Italic letters are used to denotelst. Quautities not tidal. E.g., S = the longitude in time of the time meridian; a= the earth's radius; r = the moon's distance; I, i, =inclinations of lunar orbit; Y =potential. 2d. Indefinite tidal quantities; i. e., such as must be connected with definite tidal quantities lJefore they have a meaning. E.g., ][or .R used for amplitude, Y 0 + 1t, F, ;: 3d.

The tabular value for any component other than S is
arc er chcir-d c-i

where r =the length of the group. It is a solar hour when each component hour receives one, and only one, hourly height; it may be regarded as a component hour when all hourly heights are used in the summation. (See~ 57, Part II.)

Tides o.f long period.
\Vhen all daily means are used, the factors given under the heading "Group covers one component hour" are to be applied to the long-period tides, the subscripts referring to the year or month, instead of the day as in the case of tid~s of short period. \Vhen attention is paid to the arrows, Table 43, in making the summations, the augmenting factors <lue· to using solar instead of component.time, are ~>'iven by the above formula by putting r =one solar day, and C=mf, msf, mm. The results are: r.00887 (log. =0.003835), r.00759 (log. =0.003282), 1.00217 (log.= 0.000941 ). In case of any long-period tide there is, besides the augmenting factor proper, what might be called a group factor, due to using the mean of 24 heights each day. The numerical values just given are also the group factors for Mf, MSf, and Mm.

Where one, and only one, hourly height is to go on each component hour, the arrow is used to indicate which hourly height to use. A horizontal arrow indicates that the hourly height belonging to the solar hour written is the one to be taken; an arrow pointing upward indicates that the hourly height belonging to the solar hour next preceding the solar hour written is the one to be taken. For the components J, K, 00, R, and 2 SM the value thus indicated is to be used twice. The group covered is obviously a solar and not a component hour. See ~~ 53, 57, Part II.

The upper sign is used when c, 15; the lower, when c, 15. c, 15. If the decimal of solar hour in the first equation above fall between o.o and 0.5, the arrow should be horizontal; if between 0.5 and r.o, vertical. · c, 15. Reverse this rule. The speeds used are those derived from the mean motions given in ~ lJ. Instead of the above rules, the following may be used: Suppose all solar hours of the series to have been converted into component hours; in each doubtful case mark that solar hour which lies nearest the component hour thus considered.

This table gives the nearest component "hour" (i.e., 24th of monthly or yearly period) for each day (u:30

a. m. ) of the series.
In Mf, MSf, and Mm two days sometimes fall upon the same "hour." The arrow is used to indicate the one making the closer coincidence. Consequently the one so marked, or rather the corresponding daily height, is the one to be taken in preference to the other. See note given below Table 38.

To express the acceleration in time divide by a, the speed of the semidiurnal component. 2 To find the acceleration when bis not exactly equal to Y. a, multiply the tabular values by b. This acceleration is directly expressed in time by multiplying the tabular values by

Table I7 is a graphic form of this table. Rollet de !'Isle has given in the Annales Hydrographique for I8¢ (p. 248) a graphic table serving the pur· pose of Tables I7 1 I8, or Tables 44 1 45, and which he calls an abacus. It is really the inverse of Tables 17, 18.

PREFACE.

In the annual report of the Superintendent of the United Stat13s Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1893, Appendix No. 3, a description is given of phototopography as .practiced in Italy and in the Dominion of Canada. The Oanadian surveying camera and the Italian phototheodolite, which have been described in said appendix (:No. 3, 1893), have- both been replaced by improved and more effective instruments, which will be described in the paper herewith presented, together with other photographic surveying instruments that may be regarded as typical representations of the different forms now in use. Notwithstanding the rapid rise in the popularity of photographic surveying in general, we still meet with many who express doubt as to the practfoal value and accuracy of photographic surveying methods, either from ignorance of those methods, from defective results obtained from the application of photography to the survey of areas not adapted for a phototopographic development, or, more frequently, from th~t extreme conservatism which meets all innovatioi1s with more or less doubt and distrust. Others, again, may have failed to take kindly to photographic surveying, supposing a thorough familiarity with the theories and laws of optics, descriptive geometry, perspective drawing, and general cartography to l>e essentials, without which no practical knowledge and understanding of photogrammetry may be obtained. Although it should be admitted that such knowledge will enable the student to master phototopography in a rapid and easy manner, giving him a great advantage in and au enlarged field for the practical application of the same, or in teaching its methods to others, yet the fundamental principles underlying this art are so simple that it is believed any topographer or land surveyor, with the knowledge that he should possess as such, can readily acquire enough of the theoretical fundamental principles to become fully able to apply photography successfully to practical surveys. Although it will not fall within the scope of this paper to enter into the study of either optics, descriptive geometry, perspective, photo-chemical analysis, or cartography, it will show in a general manner how photography has been applied to topographic surveys by describing the simple processes and methods that will suffice to direct beginners in their practical applications, leaving it to experience and subsequent special study to determine the measure of success, the more so as several excellent works and text-books on photographic surveying have recently been published in the English, French, Italian, and German languages. The compiler of this paper having consulted all available publications describing phototopographic methods, both foreign and domestic, gladly expresses bis indebtedness for information on this subject to Oapt. R Deville, surveyor-general of Dominion lands; to Mr. W. F. King, Alaskan boundary commissioner to Her l\f!\iesty, Ottawa, Canada; to Col. A. Laussedat, director of the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, Paris; and particularly to the following publications: La Fototopografia in Italia, Rivista l\farittima, L. P. Paganini, 1889, Fasc.

PHOTOTOPOGRAPHIC METHODS AND INSTRUMENTS.

By J. A.

FLl':MER.

INTRODUCTION.

Topography is that branch of surveying which pictures the shape of the outer visible surface of the earth, in reduced scale, as a horizontal projection, yet showing the relative positions of points of the terrene also in the vertical sense. It is, therefore, supplementary to g.eodesy in representing areas of the earth's surface, including all the necessary. details and changes in the terrene, by means of instrumental measurements made in the field. The work of filling in the details-topographic surveying in the closer sense--may be accomplished by various methods, differing in the matter of costs, time, and attainable accuracy; one may be advantageously employed for one class of work, while another may be preferable for another class or locality, under ditterent conditions, and the method best adapted for any particular region should be employed to obtain the best results. Minute and detailed methods, with ensuing accurate results, should be applied to cities and all closely settled regions, to the coastal belts, larger river valleys and lakes, particularly when navigable, and this work should be platted on a large sea.le. Arid, barren, and mountainous regions, as well as prairies and swamp lands, when sparsely settled, should be more generalized in their cartographic representation and platted on a small scale. Topographic surveys may be accomplished in various ways, of which the following are the methods and instrumental outfits more frequently in use: I. The direct platting to scale in the field of all features t.:> be represented on the :finished · chart: (a) With a plane-table and steel tape measure. (b) With a plane-table and telemeter or stadia rods. (o) With a tachygraphometer and telemeter or stadia rods. (d) With either outfit mentioned under a and b, but with a leveling instrument in addition for a more precise location of the horizontal contours. (e) 'using a barometer instead of a level for less accurate work. 'II. The compilation of all available data-cadastral surveys, public land and county survey~, railroad and canal snrveys-giving principally the horizontal distances and making a supplementary survey to supply the missing data, which in this case are principally elevations that may be supplied by leveling profiles, by trigonometric leveling, by interpolation and sketching. III. The records of the survey are in the shape of field notes and sketches (tachymetry), the map being produced by platting the r~corded data in the office: (a) With a surveyor's compass and steel tape, locating the relative positions of characteristic points in the horizontal sense, while their relative elevations are ascertained by means of a level and minor details are sketched. (b) By means of a transit and steel tape points are determined both gevgraphically and hypsometrically (using vertical angles), and minor details by sketching.

(c) By means of a transit and telemeter or stadia rods. (d) By means of a ta.chymeter and stadia rods (elevations being obtained mechanically with the instrument). . (e) By means of a transit with steel tape or telemeters, combined with a leveling instrument (fl'r locating horizontal contours). (/) By using a specially constructed aneroid barometer (Goldschmidt's) in place of the level for locating and tracing the horizontal contours in the field. IV. The field records for developing the terrene are represented by photographic negatives, taken under special conditiqns (for phototopographic purposes) from known station<i: (a) With a camera or phototheodolite, telemeters, or other distance measures (and often a barometer for obtaining elevations). (b) With a surveying camera, a separate theodolite, telemeters and aneroid barometer. (c) With a photographic plane table, a distance measure, and aneroid barometer. ( d) With a surveying camera, a separate plane table, and distance measure, frequently using an aneroid barometer for camera stations occupied without the plane table. V. The topographic survey may be accomplished by means of a specially constructed surveying camera attached to a free or captive balloon. After the area which is to be surveyed has been covered with a net of triangles and polygons it will have been provided with a framework of lines of known lengths and direction (triangulation), forming a skeleton survey of the country, and after the natural and artificial features have been filled in by one of the numerous topographjc methods Uust mentioned) with more or less detail and accuracy we will have a topographic survey of the area of more or ]Ass precision. A good example of changi1og the method with.the locality may be cited in the new survey of Italy, where Paganini's results fully proved the efficiency of phototopography for alpine work (platted on a scale of 1: 25000 and 1: 50000) and led to the adoption of the phototheodolite as an auxiliary instrument to the plane table, the latter being used for mapping the areas below 2,000 meters, while the phototheodolite was exclusively used for the delineation of the terrene situated above that altitude. Photogrammetry proper (or metrophotography) should be applied to the art of taking perspective views of buildings with a photographic camera for the purpose of constructing therefrom their elevations and ground plans, and it is used principally for architectural, archmological, and engineering purposes. The term photot~pography (or topophotography) should be generally adopted for all topographic surveys based on perspective views of the terrene obtained by means of the camera. Under photographic survey we could then class all surveys based on photographic data which do not include the orographic delineation of the terrene. Iconometry means the measuring of dimensions of objects from their perspectives (" Bildmesskunst" ), and this term could well be applied to those graphic constructions which serve to convert perspectives into horizontal projections; iconometry is the reverse of perspective drawing. Photography haA been very successfully employed for topographic surveys in Italy, Austria, and Canada, and for the production of the extensive topographic reconnaissance maps of southeastern Alaska. Although this method, invented and elaborated. by Colonel Laussedat, found its first appli· cation in France, still, both in France and in Germany, it was originally preempted by the military authorities, under whose auspices it was developed and chiefly used for so-called secret or military surveys; lately, however, photography has found a wider and more general application to surveying in those two countries, and we find this method now in use also in Greece, Spain, Portugal, Norway, Belgium, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Tonquiu, Brazil, Argentine Republic, Switzerland, and England. Although Lieut. Henry A. Reed has, for several years past, taught phototopography, theoretically and practically, at the United States Military Academy at West Point, there seems to be no record of any further work of this kind undertaken by others in the United States. In the following paper we will treat principally of those plwtogrammetric methods which are

CHAPTER I.
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF ICONOMETRY.

If only one perspective of an object, including its distance line, the principal point, and the horizon line is given-in other words, if the point of view and the central projection upon a vertical plane of an object are given-the object itself can not yet be determined regarding its position and dimensions. In the same way the geographic position of a point can not be located

by means of the plane table from a known station, unless direct measurements to ascertain the distance of such point from the station are resorted to. If, however, two different perspectives (including their elements) of the same object, obtained from two different known stations, are given, the dimensions and the position of the object with reference to the two stations may be determined iconometrically in a manner analogous to tha~ in

which a point is located (by intersection) on the plane-table sheet by being ob.served upon from two different plane·table stations. Referring to fig. 1, the positions of the camera stations A and A', also the distance A A', may be given, and two photographs containing the image t of an object 1', including the image a' of the other camera station, may have been obtained from the two stations.

If the base Jine A A', fig. 2, be laid clown on paper, in reduced scale, and if the pictures 1lfN and M' N', fig. 3, be brought into the same relative positions with reference to the platted line which they bad at the time of their exposure in the field, the position '1' of the pictured point (with reference to the platted points A and A') may be located by drawing the rays At and A' t' to their intersection. To locate the platted position of T the horizontal pr~jections of the rays A t and A' t' are brought to their intersection on the platting sheet, fig. 4, which may be done by ascertaining

the proper positions of the lines of intersection of the picture planes with the horizontal platting plane with reference to A and A' (by "orienting" the picture traces). The map being the orthogonal projection of the terrene in horizontal plan, the horizontal projections of the perspectives (or picture planes exposed in the vertical plane) will appear as straight lines, termed "picture traces," fig. 4. The correct orientation of the picture traces forms the most important part of i-conometric

platting, the subsequent location of pictu,re points being accomplished by bringing the horizontal projections of the visual rays-lin~s of direction-drawn to identical points to their corresponding intersections.
I. ORIENTING THE PICTURE TRACES ON '£HE WORKING SHEET.

(1) A base line AA', measured in the field, has been platted to scale, fig. 2, and two pictures, MN and 11!' N', fig. 3, had been obtained from the camera stations A and A 1 respectively by meaus of a surveying camera. The focal lengths of the pictures (=/ and .f respectively), the· positions of the principal points (P and P'), and the horizon lines may also be given. It is desired to locate T with reference to AA' upon the working sheet. The distances: AP=f; A' P' =f' (fig. 4); tP, t'P', Pa' and P'a (to be measured on the pictures MN and Jl1' N' respectively) and the line·AA' are given. The distances Aa' and A'a may be found graphically (by constructing the right-angle triangles AI'a' and A' I''a), or they may be computed from the equations:

Aa'

= v' (.fl P) + (l'a' )

These distances are now laid off upon AA' from A. and A' respectively, semicircles are described over Aa' and A'a., and two circles are drawn about A and A' with/ and/' respectively, as raclii.

UNITED STA.TES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

The intersections P and P' of these two pairs of circles locate the horizontal projections of the principal points on the two picture-traces, the latter being represented by the tangents Pli' and P'a. The distances x (=Pt) and x' ( = P 1t 1 ) are now measured on the pictures and laid off on the tangents as indicated in fig. 2, when the intersection of the lines drawn from_ A and A' through the points (just found) t and t' will loc:ate the horizontal projection of 1' with reference to A and A'. (2) The instrument used was a camera or phototheodolite: In this case the angles a and a' (fig. 2) may be measured directly in the field.

IV. THE FIVE-POINT PROBLEM (BY PROFESSOR STEINER).

In the methods just described it had been assumed that the position of the camera station was known with reference to the surrounding points A, B, 0. . . . . In case the panorama pictures were taken from a camera station of unknown position and a series of known points are pictured upon the panorama views, the position of the camera station may be found (with reference to the surrounding points of known positions), and the orien· tation of the picture trace may be accomplished by means of Prof. F. Steiner's so-called ''fivepoint problem" (fig. 10), if one of the views contains the pictures of jive or more points of known positions. The panorama view MN may contain the images a, b, c, d, and e of the points A, B, O, D, and E (already plotted upon the working sheet), and also the picture of a suspended plumb line or other vertical (or horizontal) line. a

The points a, b, c, d, and e of the negative are again projected upon the straight edge of a paper strip= a', b', c', d', and e'.

b' falls upon .AB, d' falls upon AD, e' falls upon .AE,
when the strip will have the position a 1, b1, c1, d 1, e1· The line drawn through .A and a 1 (the latter transferred by means of the strip) will be the tangent in A to the ellipse E 1 (passing through A, B, D, E and through the station point S).

(2) Simplified construction for locating the camera station by means of the five-point problem.-The preceding method is rather complicated, but Professor Schiffner devised the following construction (fig. 11), in which the drawing of the ellipses E 1 and E 2 is avoided: The same five points, A, B, O, D, and E, with their images a, b, c, d, and e, on one plate 1lfN, may be given. The two lines, b3 Band b4 B, tangent in B to the two ellipses E 1 and E2, respectively, are located precisely in the same manner as the two tangents a 1 A and az A were found for the point A.

638

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC 8URVEY.

The intersections R1 and Rz of the tangent pairs a 1 A, b3 B and ~ A, b4 B (belonging to the ellipses E 1 and E2, respectively) are situated upon a line Qx, forming one side of the polar triangle QxT, common to both ellipses. This line Q;; intersects the dfagonal AD in x and the quadrilateral side BD in Q, and the lines drawn through Q from A and through x from B. will intersect each other in the fourth point of intersection (S) of the two ellipses. The quadrilateral ABDS, obtained by connecting the four points of intersection of the two ellipses, has the point x as the intersection of its diagonals. By prolonging the sides BD and A 8 to their point of intersection Q and the sides AB and SD to their point of intersection T, the three diagonal points QxT will form the polar triangle common to the two ellipses. Also this method remains complicated and requires many lines to be drawn before the picture trace and the camera station ( S) may be plotted. (3) Special application of the jive-point problem for the case when the jive points range themselves into a triangle.-The application of the "five-point problem" becomes very much simplified, however., for the special case when the five points range themselves into a triangle, of which two sides (AO and OE) contain three points each (fig. 12).

V. THE THREE-POINT PROBLEM.

If the triangulation points are not sufficiently close together that five or more points may be pictured on one perspective, and if stations are occupied with the camera that are not connected with the trigonometric survey, it will become necessary to employ other means to determine the position of the camera station with reference to the surrounding triangulation points. In order to connect the camera station with the triangulation system by direct measurements and observations, made at the camera station, it will be requisite that at least three triangulation points be visible from such Rtation, unless the location of the camera station is to be made by observations made from other stations. In the latter case the occupation of two (better three) triangulation points, if favorably located, would suffice to establish the(" concluded") position of the camera station. The determination of the position of an occupied point by observing upon three fixed and known points is generally knO\yn as the "three-point problem," "station platting," ''station pointing," or "Pothenot's method," although Snellius had used the same method in his trigono· metric work in the Netherlands in the second decade of the seventeenth century. Let A, B, and O, fig. 13, be the three poiuts, the positions of which are known. A fourth undetermined point S

640

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

may have been occupied from which the horizontal angles A SB= M and B S 0 = N may have been observed instrumentally. The position of S with reference to A, B, and 0 may then be ascertained in various ways. (1) Using the three-arm protractor (mechanical application of the three-point problem).-The simplest (and crudest) inethod is purely mechanical in its application. The two horizontal angles .Mand N are laid off upon a three-arm protractor ("station pointer"), or upon a piece of tracing paper, moving the three radials SA, SB, and SO over the three fixed and platted points A, B, and 0 until the three radials SA, SB, and 80 bisect their corresponding points A, B, and O. Holding the two angles Mand Nunchanged in this position, the point 8 is transferred to the working sheet. (2) Graphic solution of the three-point problem· (a) Using the so-called "two-circle problem."-Theoretically the best graphic method is that which locates the position of the fourth point S, fig. 13, as the intersection of two circles, one passing through A and B and having all angles of circumference= ABB= Mover AB that may bE! drawn over the line AB as chord, the other circle passing through B and 0 and having over BO as chord all angles of circumference equal to BSO = N.

From the platted triangle side AB we lay off at A and B the angles B.A 0 and AB01 each equal to:
lSO - 2 JASB) = 900 - ABB= 900 - M 2

and about the point c1, thus obtained, a circle ABS is described with the radius= c1 A = c1B. The observed angle ASB = .M will then be an angle of circumference over AB, and the poiut S will be located somewhere on the arc over the chord AB. By means of the angle BSO =Na second circle BOS is described over the triangle side BO, m a similar manner, about C.i as center with the radius c1B = c10. The obseryed second angle BSO = N will be an angle of circumference over the chord BO, hence the point Swill be situated also upon the arc over the chord BO and the true position of Bis at tlle point of intersection S of the two circles. (b) Using the method of Bohnenberger and Bessel.-The following constructive method (devised

by Bobnenberger and Bessel) is readily applied and of a vel'y simple character, fig. 14. If we describe a circle through two of the three given points A ~nd B a11d the station S as the third point the angles ASB = AOB = Jlf and BSO = BAO= N (being angles of cfrcumforence upon the same arcs AD and DO respectively). B Hence, if we lay oft' the observed hori..... zontal angle Mon the base line AO at 0 .... and the other horizontal angle Non AO at A, the point of intersection D of their convergent sides CD and AD will be on the line connecting the third point B and the platted station S. After having thus found the direction of the line DB the position of S on the line DB may be found as fol· .J'\ lows: \ \ At any point x of the line DB the ob_ \ served angles Mand N are laid off to either '~~ side of DB, iu the sense in which they were \ \ observed. Lines AS and GS drawn \ through A and 0 parallel to xy and xz, respectively, will locate the position of the station S (upon DB) with reference to the three points A, B, and G. This construction is only recommended when BD is sufficiently long (in fig. 14 it is evidently too short) to admit of a correct prolongation of its direction toward S. The picture trace containing the horis zontal projections of the pictured pointtl a, b, and c may now be oriented in the known manner by adjusting the paper strip over the radials SA, SB, and SC.
VI. ORIENT.A.'l'ION OF THE PICTURE '.1.'lt.A.CES1 BASED UPON :MADE IN TilE FIELD. INSTRUMENTAL MEASUltEMENTS

When no points are known of the area to be mapped phototopographically the elements of the perspective (horizon line, principal point, and distance line) can no longer be ascertained from the photograph alone, but instrumeutal observations will have to be resorted to. This method, having been adopted by Oapt. E. Deville, will be described in Chapter III, II, 3, iu connection with the Oanadian method.
VII. RELATIONS BETWEEN '.l'WO PERSPEO'.l'IVES OF THE SAl\IE OB.TECT VIEWED FROM DIFFERENT STATIONS (" KERNELPOINTS" .A.ND '' KERNELPLANES ").

A more generalized application of photogrammetric methods has been inaugurated since Prof. G. Hauck published his investigations and results regarding the relationship existing· between systelJls of three lines, each of the latter being in a different plaue. (''Theorie der trilinearen Verwandtschaft ebener Systeme," Journal fiir reine und angewandte Mathematik, berausgegeben von L. Kronecker und A. Weierstrass, 1883, Bd. 9J.) The practical value of Professor Hauck's deductions had been tested by the studeuts attending his lectures in 1882 during the exercises which are connected with the course in descriptive geometry at the Technical High School in Berlin (Charlottenburg). (1) Kernelpoints and kernelplmie.~.-ln his discussion of the relationship existing between two perspectives of the same object taken from different stations, Professor Hauck bas evolved some G584--41

642

properties which may be very useful and of value in iconometric platting. involved in the application of photogfammetry may be stated as follows:

The principal law

If two projections (perspectives or photographs) of tlte same object are projected by perspective rays emanating from the "kernelpoints" ("kernpunkte ") as centers the line of intersection of the two planes of projection (picture planes) will be their perspectiYe axis.

With the aid of this law the projection on a third plane of an o~ject may be deduced from the given projections 011 two planes of the same object. Or, for our case: If two photographs, MN and Jlf1 N 1, taken from two stations Sand 8 1 (and representing the same object), are given, the orthogonal horizo11tal projection (ground plan) of tlie same object may be constructed therefrom. Professor Hauck's methods are also applicable to photographs obtained when the plate was exposed in an' inclined position. In order to illustrate the connection existing between two different perspectives of the same object, we will refer to fig. 15, representing the simple case where the two perspective plaues (1l1N and Jlf' N') are vertical. Let S and S' represent the two camera stations (centers of projection or points of view for the vertical picture planes Jl[N and Jlf' N'), s' the picture of S' i11 1l1N, s the picture of Sin 1lf1 N', I.Q the line of intersection of the two picture planes 11/N and JI[' N', a image of the point A in Jlt.N, a' image of the point A in M' JY'. The two pictured points sands' are the so-called" kernelpoints" (kernpunkte), and any plane (" kernelplane") passing through the line (base line) SS' will contain the "kemelpoints" sands'. The position of the "kernel points" may be found graphically bypassing a plane ("kernelplane") through the two stations and a third point A (pictured in both pla11es MN and llf' N'), which will intersect the first picture plane 111N in the line a.v' and the picture plane Jlf' N' in sa'. Then the following conditions will prevail: l. The lines of intersection as' and <i' s will intersect the line I.O in one point (.0). !!. The pictures <i and a' of the point A will be on the lines as' and a' s. 3. The lines as' and <i' .~will pass through the pictures (s' and s) of the two camera stations (S' and S).

of the iconometric constructions will arise, inasmuch as such pictured stations (sands') will be "kernel points." The line of intersection (I.Q) of the two picture planes (MN and M' N') may also play an important part in the iconometric platting, not only for pictures exposed in vertical planes, but even more so when they are exposed in inclined planes. If two pictures MN and M' N 1 are given (in fig.16 their traces are represented as JJJI and H' 11', respectively) representing the same object (viewed from two stations S and S'), then the pictures s and s' (''kernel points") of the reciprocal camera stations may be located upon the picture planes by eonstruction (if they are not shown in the field of the pictures), as shown in fig. 16. 'fhe horizontal projections (s1 and s 11 ) of the" kernelpoints" (sands') are identical with the points of intersection of the base line (SS') and the pictures traces (HH and H' H'). The horizontal prqjections of the line of intersection (I.Q, fig.15) of the two picture planes (MN and .ilf' N') will be represented by the point of intersection (i) of the two picture traces (HH and H' H'). Hence, if we revolve the picture planes about their ground lines until they fall within the horizontal plane of tlle ground plan, the line J.Q, fig·. 15 (common to both picture planes), will be l'epresented by the lines ri' i( I), fig.

Tbe space (00') intercepted on the scale by the horizon lines of the two picture planes will represent the difference in elevation between the two camera stations (Sand S'). This scale may be drawn to show on both lines I.Q of the pictures when sepa.rated. The picture (photograph) itself frequently may not be sufficiently extended to contain the line I.Q, in which case the scale may still be utilized by laying it off on a line xx" on picture ]}JN and on a line zz" on picture M' N', where xx" and zz" are parallel with the line of intersection (ID) of the two picture planes MN .and M' N' and as long as the following relation remains fulfilled:

In topographic surveys, figures in level planes are not frequently dealt with, except when locating the outlines of lakes and marshes, including coast lines, and the simplest way to plat these would be to expose photographic plates (held in a horizontal position) from a balloon at points of known positions and at identical or known elevations. The platting of such figures, when photographed on vertically exposed (also inclined) plates from stations higher than the figure's plane, will also be an easy matter. It may even be accomplished !f but one view of such figure had been obtained from only oue station (of a known position), provided the difference in elevation between the camera station and the figure's (horizontal) plane, the principal point, and the focal length of the view are known. With reference to fig. 19: H H = Horizon plane of the camera station S, 1lf N = Picture plane (vertical), G G = Ground plane or horizontal plane coinciding with the surface of the lake A B C D, S S 0 = h = difference in elevation between the camera station S aud the surface of the water in the lake A B 0 ]),

PHOTOGRAPHS ON INCLINED PLATES.

In the preceding we have regarded photographic plates (perspectives) only that had been exposed in a vertical plane, and although the use of inclined plates for phototopographic purposes is not to be generally recommended (on account of the complications that will arise in the ordinarily simple constructions in iconometric platting from vertically exposed plates, and because the relations which exist between the elements of the perspective and the orthogoual projection in horizontal plan of the pictured objects will not be so readily recognized), still, occasious may arise where the selection of the available or accessible stations will be so circumscribed that the exposure of inclined plates will become necessary in order to control the inaccessible tcrrene (above or below the camera station). Photographs may also have been obtained with an ordinary camera, without any device for adjusting the plate in vertical plane, or the use for iconometric platting of the photographs (perhaps taken only for illustrative purposes) may have been an afterthought. With reforence to fig. ao we have: PP =principal plane. BH = horizontal plane passing through the second nodal point of the camera lens (at the station S). GG =ground plane. 1lfN =picture plane. 0' P =trace of picture plane .llN, in the horizon plane HH. 0' 0 />" = ground line of picture plane JlfN. S0 = foot of the station S. P' P =principal line of the picture plane. P' =principal point of the perspective 111N. SS., =vertical of the station; it will penetrate the picture plane MN above (or below) the horizon line at s. The traces of this vertical s80 in the picture plane is the vanishing point for the perspectives of all vertical lines that may be pictured on ,~fN. P'SP= PsS = <l' =angle of inclination of the plate .JlfN. SP =(horizontal) line from S perpendicular to horizon line V' P. SA =line of direction from Stoa point A, pietured in 1llN as a.

If we revolve SP, in the_vertica.l plane PP, about P until SP falls within the picture plane, then the point Swill fall into (S) and the line Sa will fall into (S)a. The vertical plane containing the line SA and passing through SS0 will intersect the ground plane in S 0 a0 · If we now revolve the line S0 P 0 , in the vertical plane PP, about P 0 until S 0 Po falls within the picture plane MN, then the point S 0 will fall into (80 ) and the trace S 0 a 0 will have assumed the position (S0 )a0 , and the iutersflction A of the trace 8 0 a 0 with the line of direction Sa will locate the platted position of the pictured point a in the ground plane GG. The line sa intersects the ground line in a0 , and S 0 a0 will be the radial in the ground plane to the platted position of A and passing through the foot S 0 of the station S. To find A on S 0 a., we first locate in the picture plane the intersection (A) of the revolved lines (S)a and ( So)ao. This point (A) revolved in the vertical plane a0 8 0 S about a0 will locate A uponSoa.,. To locate the position of A in GG, in the manner just shown, we should know the position of the line 0' P, as well as the points S and P. These are known or may readily be found if the position of the principal point P', the length of the distance line SP', and the value of the angle of inclination (a) for the plate are known.

When a photographic plate iu a surveying camera is intentionally exposed in an inclined position, it will generally be exposed in such a way that t.lie principal line ff' still coincides with the intersection of the picture plane MN and the principal plane PP, fig. 30. When the angle of inclination a is an angle of elevation (depression) the horizon line (intersection of horizon plane and inclined picture plane) will fall below (above) the line representing the horizon line on the plate when exposed vertically. In order to use the inclined plate for

The horizontal angle a (at S') included between this line of direction S' S 11 and the principal plane (or horizontal projection of optical axis S' P 0 ) may have been observed in the field. The line S' Sin fig. 32 represents the elevation of the station S (laid off in the platting scale). If we revolve this line S'S about S' P 0 into the platting plane it will assume the position shown as S'(S) in fig. 31. After erecting at (S) a line (S)(P) perpendicular to S'(S) the angle of inclination r of the plate JlfN is laid off upon (S)(P) from (S).

IV, APPLIOATION OF PROFESSOR BAUCK'S METHOD,

The constructions just described for locating the horizontal directions to points photographed on inclined plates may be greatly simplified by applying Professor Hli.uck's method, by utilizing the properties of the "kernel points" of two photographs obtained from different stations but comprising the same ground. With reference to fig. 34: S and S' = the two camera stations.
S 0 and S 0 1 =the foot points of Sand S' respectively. MN and M' N' = inclined picture planes; both contain the image a and a' of a point A and the pictures s' ands ("kernel points") of the stations S' and S. a 0 and a 0 1 = orthogonal projections (in the ground plane GG) of a and a' respectively. A 0 = orthogonal projection of A in the ground plane. ~, s' and rr =kernel points for picture plane JlfN. ~',sand 7C 1 =kernel points for picture plane M'N'.

These "kernel points" a.re of importance, inasmuch asThe horizontal direction S 0 A 0 (or S 0 1 Ao) intersects the ground line gg' of MN (or M' N') in a0 (or a.' 0 ). The line connecting a and s' ("kernel point") in MN and the connection of a' and s in M' N' intersect each other in the same point fl of the line of intersection of the two picture planes, and also intersect the ground lines gg' of the picture planes in the "kernel points" 7C and 7r', respectively. All lines in MN, connecting s' with pictured points, and those iu M 1N 1, connecting s with tile pictures in M'N' of tile same points, intersect eacll other in points fl of the line of intersection of the two inclined picture planes. The kernel points ::E and ::E' are the intersections of the verticals passing through the camera stations (Sand S'), with the inclined picture planes. They are the "vanishing points" for the pictures of all vertical lines shown on the negatives, and whenever the pictures contain images of vertical lines the intersections of these would locate ~ and

(1) .1.lfethod of Prof. lV. ,Jo1·dan.-In 1874 Professor Jordan made a map of the oasis "Daebel,' including the village "Gassr-Dachel," based on photographs taken with an ordinary camera by Remele, obtained on Gerhard Rohlf's African expedition during the winter of 1873-74. Care was exercised to expose the plates in vertical plane, and horizontal directions to at least three points for each photograph were instrumentally measured to obtain the data needed for the proper orientation of the pictures. Vertical angles to at least two such points (for every picture) were also observed to give the means for locating the horizon lines of the pictures and thus enabling the draftsman to deduce the elevations of other points pictured 011 the photographs. With reference to fig. 35 we have: 00' =horizon line, .ff'= principal line, P = priueipal point, SP= focal length= J; variable for different pictures. The ordinates aa', bb', and cc'= y 1, Y2, and Y:1, respectively. 'rhe abscissro of the three points a, b, and c be x 17 x 2 , and x 3 resvecti vely.

Thus the abscissre x 17 x2, and X3 1 (the principal line ff') and the focal length f may be found. With the aid of th~ observed vertical angles fJ the horizon line 00' may be located on the photograph .. For example, if the vertical aIJgle (:1 3 = c Sc' had been observed to the point o, we find:

The horizon line 00' will fall below the pictured point c by the vertical distance - 0f c s and for the point a the vertical distance to the horizon line would be

At least two vertical angles having been observed for each plate, the horizon line 00' may thus be located and marked upon the negative, when the principal point P may also be marked on 00' by means of the abscissre x1, x2, and X3 =a' P, b' P, and Pc', respectively. (2) Method of Dr. G. Le Bon.-Dr. Le Bon, who used his instrument chiefly for the draughting of ancient buildings and monuments in India, provided the ground-glass plate of his camera with a net of squares, each square having sides 1 centimeter long, the latter being drawn parallel with the horizon-and principal lines, which latter two were subdivided into millimeters. This arrangement enabled the operator to obtain the measurements of objects directly by inspection of the image on the (graduated) ground-glass plate, To determine the dimensions of

For example: (a} To find the distance D of an object of unknown height H. Two stations, Sand S', are occupied on a base line (which is measured directly in the field) laid off in a direction at right angles to the base oft.he object, fig. 36.

GENERAL AHITlllllETIC I>ETERllllN'ATION OF THI> ELEMEN'TS OF THE ITALIAN PIIOTOGHAPI!IC PERSl'F.CTI\'ES.

The panoramic views which subserved the map making were obtained by ten successive exposures. After each exposure the camera was moved in azimuth by a horizontal ang1e of 3Go, and as each plate subtends a horizontal angle of 420, the two ends of adjoining plates have a common margin of a width of 3° in arc, corresponding to a width of 15 millimetres. These common margins of two adjoining plates serve principally to ascertain whether the adjustments of the phototheoclolite have s been changed during the occupancy of a station. --~ (a) Orientation of the picture trace.-The horizontal projection of one complete panorarna composed of ten plates will be a regular decagon, fig. 38, with a radius of the inscribed circle equal to the principal focal length (constant) of the camera. P', P 2 , P 10 =-(horizontal) picture traces, V = panorama station, VP' = Y 1n = VP Io = f = principal focal length of camera.

After the position of one panoramic view has been platted on the map, its picture trace will be oriented, and with it the remaining nine views of the panorama. After the horizontal angle m, fig. 3!), included between the principal ray VP' of view I'' and the horizontal direction to the triangulation point S, fig. 39, has been platted the orientation of each succeeding view P 2 , P 3 P 10 is.accomplished by adding successively 360, 720, 1030 (360-w0 ) to the angle m. (b) Platting the lines of direction to pictured points of the terrene.-The orientation of the panorama haviug been made, the lines of direction to points phoI tographed on the panorama plates may readily be I I platted.

The abscissa P 1s1 = x, fig. 39, is laid off on 00 1 , fig. 40, from P 1 in the sense of the direction to S (whether S is to the right or to the left of the principal line ff, fig. 39) with reference to the principal point P 1 , locating s1 (the orthogonal projection of the pictured point in the ground plane) and a line drawn from V through s1 = Vs 1 , which will be the ray VS, fig. 39, projected in the platting plane. The position of S on the platting sheet is obtained by finding the point of intersection of two or more lin_es of direction, obtained in a similar manner, from other pictures containing images of Sand taken from· different station8, as all rays to the same object, seen from different stations, must intersect each other in the same point on the platting sheet. The elevations of pictured terrene points are readily determined after the selected points (identified on several pictures) have been determined and platted in horizontal plane, in the manner just described. If the elevation of the station Y is known, the elevation of the line of horizon 00 1 on the plate, fig. 39, may easily be obtained by adding the height of instrument to the elevation of Y. (c) Determination of the elevations of pictitred points.-Disregarding the effects of curvature and refraction, the elevations of all the points on tlie plate which are bisected by the horizon line 00 1 have the same elevation as the optical axis of the instrument at V. The elevations of pictured points, above or below the horizon line, are obtained by determining their elevation above or their depressions below the line 00 1· If D = horizontal distance from station V to a point S, fig. 39, = VS 1 , fig. 39, to be measured in the plattmg scale.

This formula would answer for all points of the perspective if the image plate were a cylindrical surface of radius = f (instead of being a tangential plane to such cylinder), if the decagon were a circle (as it is the case for the sensitive film of the panoramic cameras, and Colonel Moessard's cylindrograph, which will be described later). Differences of elevation, taken from the perspectives, are positive or negative according to the relative positions of the pictured points with reference to the horizon line 00', fig. 39, whether above 00' or below the same, and the apparent elevations of such points (above mean sea level) are obtained by adding their ordinates (L, fig. 39) to or subtracting them from the elevation of the camera station ( V, fig. 39). By comparing the elevatious thus ol>tainml fur identical points from photographs exposed from different stations the hypsometric determinations of secondary points of the terreue may be checked. (d) Checking the position of the horizon line of a photograph.-To check the position of the horizon line 00', fig. 39, photographs are selected which show the images of two or more triangulation points, the elevations of the latter, determiued from the photographs, are compared with those given in the triangulation records and discrepancies are adjusted by shifting the line 00'. Should the elevations of the triangulation points be unknown, or should the pictures from any station not contain the pictures of such points, this check may still be made by measuring the vertical angles (a, fig. 39, with the vertical circle of the phototheodolite from such camera station) to a series of prominent points (S, fig. 39) and compariug their computed ordinates (L, fig. 39) with those obtained from the pictures. We find from the similar triangles VSS' and rss', fig. 39: tan SVS1 = tan a = _L_ = J!. , D d and we bad according to formula 2a:

where m is the horizontal angle included between tlie vertical plane ( VSS') passing through the camera station V and the point S, fig. 39, and the principal plane ( Vff'). This angle w should be measured (with the horizontal circle of the phototheodolite) for several points Sat every stet· tion, whence a limited or insufficient number of triangulation points may be seen. If the computed values for y, formula 5, are not in accord with th,ose obtained by direct measurement on the photograph, the horizon line 00', fig. 39, must be adjusted until the values for the ordinates measured on the picture are tl11~ same as those computed by aid of formula 5. The necessity of the precise determiuation of the value f (focal length) is evident from tlie preceding, and if the panorama pictures contain a imflicient number of well-defined pictures of surrounding triangulation points, the determination off may readily be made by means of the adjusted horizon line 00', fig. 39.

II. GRAPHICAL ICONOMETRIC :!IIETHODS.

(1) 1lfetltod of Col. A. Laussedat.-Oolonel Laussedat's methods of constructing topographic maps from perspective views of the terreno~ having beP,n widely published, form the groundwork for all subsequent work in this direction; they are chiefly of a graphical character and they are in harmony with the laws of perspective. · l1aussedat considers two cases in reconnaissance surveys for geographic expeditions to which photo-topographic methods may be applied with advantage: (1) The explorer may remain sufficiently long in one locality to make a survey on a large scale, say 1: 20 000, and even larger for sped al purposes. (2) The explorer moves rapidly from place to place, gathering only the most necessary data on his itinerary to enable him to plat the topography of the traversed country as a "running survey" on a small scale-say 1 :50 000 and even smaller-preserving and representing only the principal topographic features met \vith on tho track survey. In the first-mentioned case the explorer will measure one or more base lines, with as great an accuracy as the means at hand and the time at his disposal will admit. He will then cover the area to be mapped with a system of triangles, connected with (or founded upou) the base line, aud, inasmuch as the triangulation stations will be occupied with the surveying camera, the scheme should be laid out with due reference to the subsequent iconometric platting of the topographic features. Wlien applying the ordinary surveying methods the triangulation scheme would probably be laid out with a view toward covering as large a territory as possible, occupying the least number of intervisible pQints. With the use of photography, however, the conditions are changed; every topographic feature that is to be platted iconometrically should be seeu from two or more camera· stations. The latter are to be triangulation stations, or they will have to be tied on to the general scheme by special supplementary instrumental observations. St.ill it is not always essential that the higliest peaks, which may be included in the trigonometric survey (as concluded points), should also be occupied with the camera, as frequently other camera stations will answer the requirements just as well. Regarding the second case, where the explorer follows a certain route, making only the most necessary (and at best but short) side excursions, the pnoto-topographic method is even of greater value than in the first case, particularly when traversing open and broken country. For this kind of reconnoissance it may be well claimed that the photographic method surpasses all other surveying methods rega1·ding the amount of data which may be collected in a limited time period. All topographic operations and instruments servo to measure vertical and horizontal angles, and a photographic perspedive (of which the focal length and the positions of the horizon line and principal point are known) will give all the data ueeded to determine the vertical and horizontal angles of lines of direction drawn from the point of view to all points pictured on the photograph. 'l'he points A and B, pictured on the vertical plate MN; fig. 49, may represent the images of two distant mountain pealis; <t and b will be their orthogonal projections upon the 110rizon line HH1 (picture trace in horizontal plane RH).

The distances Sa and SA, fig. 52, are measured on the platting sheet and ·the ordinate aA, fig. 49, of the pictured point a, on the negative. Perpendiculars are then erected to SA in A and a and the Jatter is made equal to the ordinate of a taken from the picture= Aa =a (a), fig. 52. If we now draw the line S(a.) (to its intersection with the perpendicular in A), tbeu tile triangles Sa (a) and SA (A) will be similar and the angle AS (A) will represent the vertical angle (of elevation) of the visual ray from S to A revolved about SA into the plane of the horizon or into the platting plan. From the similar triangles Sa (a) and SA. (A) we derive the proportional equation:
A (A): SA= a.(a): Sa

whence
A (A)=-------

a (a). SA sa

The value found for A (A) mea~mred on the platting sea.le will give the difference in elevation between camera station horizon and the point A. In practical work the elevations of the camera stations are known, and by adding the height of the instrument including the value A (A) to the elevation of S, fig. 49, the absolute height of A will be found, which, however, is still to be corrected for curvature and refraction. A second value for the elevation of A may be found in the same manner for another negative containing the image a (taken from another station), and the mean of several such determinations is adopted for the final value for the height of A. (c) Drawing the plan, including hm·izontal contours.-After some little practice points, pictured on different negatives but representing identical points in nature, will readily be identified by the obser>er and he will soon be able to pick out the characteristic points to reproduce the water courses, watersheds, roads, canals, etc., on the platting sheet. After these principal guide lines have been well located on the chart, buildings, outlines of woods, marshes, etc., are platted, including everything that is to be shown on the finished map. Enough points should be platted iconometricaUy to give a good control for a. correct delineation of the relief. When the number of points determined on the plan is sufficient, or if they are favorably located to give an adequate control only for the delineation in the horizontal sense, additional points should be platted in order to obtain an equally good control of the terreue in the vertical sense. The planimetric work completed, elevations of as many of the platted points as seem necessary (or additional ones) are determined and inscribed on the chart. Horizontal and equidistant contours may now be drawn, by interpolation, to harmonize with th~ elevations suffixed on the chart to the points of control, conforming their courses (between the located points) to the configuration of the terrene, as it is shown on the photographs. It can not be denied that a certain amount of study and practical application are required to enable the draftsman to correctly interpret forms of the terrene, shown in perspective. Yet, it should also be admitted tllat such translation or conversion of the relief of the terrene into the horizontal map projections may be far more accurately accomplished (at one's leisure) by means of geometrically correct perspectives, than could be accomplished by sketching in the field. When topographic features are sketched, as seen from one (]irectiou, they will frequently be found to have been misconceived when they are seen again from another (not anticipated) point of view. Of course, the platted forms may then be corrected in a mea::mre, at least, still, mauy details are sketched which will not be seen again from other stations, and, even those that are seen again nuder other conditions may not be modified to conform to their true shapes, unless the original station, whence they were first seen and sketched, could ue reoccupied to verify the suggested changes and corrections. Generally speaking, t<ipographers regard a second occupation of a. ::;tation with little favor, it being considered too great a waste of time, retarding progress, and cousiderably increasing the cost of the work. Jn icouometric platting, however, it is always an easy matter to refer back again to panoramic viewR obtaiued from some other station, and tile platting of topographic details should not be attempted without having first made a careful study of and a. close comparison between the various pictures representing the same featurel-1 but seen from different points of view. (2) Method of Dr. A. Meydenbaur.-The pantoscopic lens (made by E. Bush, H.athenow,

678

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURYEY.

Prussia) of Dr. Meydenbaur~s surveying camera commands an angle of about 1000. By excluding an external ring of the effective disk of these lenses by means of a diaphragm, pictures are obtained subtending an angle of but G<> 0 , requiring six plates for a complete panorama. 'fhis camera has neither telescope nor vertical circle but it is provided with a horizontal circle, thus enabling the operator to control the revolutio11s of the camera in azimuth. After this camera has been set up aml adjusted over a station the panorama is photographed by exposing six plates in succession, each successive turn in azimuth of the camera covering an angle of 60°, fig. 53, ancl two adjoining plates lapping over each other by 3° in arc. These common margins (like Paganini's plates) contain identical sections of the panorama view. They may serve to find the value for the focal length of the pietures, and they I : control the permanency of the camera's adjustments during one complete revolution in azimuth. (n) Determination of the focal length for the panorama views.-From the six plates, covering the entire horizon from oue station, objects may be selected on the I center lines of the common margins of adjoining plates I which should be equidistant from the principal lines of -~,. ... ·'~:-? 1 :.\·>· ... the two plates. ~· _.,, I ·::. · · l ···· ·· ·;"·'!·· 6·0'·f\'\ ,1'..

The greatest discrepancy between any two values should not exceed 0·2 mm, if the instrument was well adjusted. The sum =2l of ·two such distances FIG. 53 (between two of the corrected principal lines) will represent the effective lengths of one picture, or the length of one side of a regular hexagou, with an inscribed. circle of the radius equal to the constant focal lengths ( =f) of the negatives. This length -"f may be found graphically or it may be computed from the formula:

When positive prints are to be used in the icouometric map construction it will become necessary to correct this focal length f to correspond with any changes that may have taken place in the dimensions of the prints when compared with their negatives. By comparing the distances between the" teeth" (marking the principal and horizon lines) on the negative with those included between their contact prints on the positive the total linear changes of the print in the directions of ·.. . ............ the principal aud borizon lines are readily found ..

This determination off should be made for every print that is to be used in the iconometric map construction. The topographic map is graphically constructed from the negatives and prints in a manner very similar to that described for Colonel J.Jaussedat's method.

The method just described is general in character, but when the camera is provided with a. hor1zo11tal circle, enabling the obsen·er to cover the horizon with six plates by revolving the camera exactly 600 in azimuth after each exposure, the followiug method is generally applied: The constant focal length=/ of the negatives is laid oft' on the principal line below tl1e principal point= c'O for negative I and= c"O for negative II.

These angles a' and a" are transferred from the negatives I and II to the corresponding ends of the base liue I II, as indicate(} in lig. 56. After laying off the focal length f from the base stations I and II upon the sides of the augles a' and a" ( = Ic' and IIc" respectively) and erecting perpendiculars (H' 11' and H 11 H 11 ) inc' aud c'' to Io' and IIe" respectively, they will represent the oriented picture traces of negatives I aml II.

Deville ( Oanailian mcthorl).-This so.called Canadian metl1od has been in use under the auspices of the department of the interior of the Dominion of Cauada siuee 1888. Deville has given a full account of these methods in Photographic Surveying, pulJli:<hed at the government printing bureau, at Ottawa, in 1895, and the following paragraphs have been largely taken from Deville's hook: (a) General remarl.:s on field worlc.-The area to be surveyed is covered with a triangulation net, preferably before the phototopographic survey is commenced, ancl a secondary triangulation is

carried along with the phototopographic work to locate the camera stations in both the horizontal and vertical sense, with reference to the primary triangulation stations already established. The surveyor makes a rough plat of the entire triangulation (in the field), on which he locates all the stations occupied to enable him to recognize the weak points of his work and to plan his operations with a thorough understanding and good assurance of success. The instrumental work in the field is done merely to locate the camera stations and certain reference points (if the triangulation points are not sufficiently close together), all topographic features being deduced from the pictures. · 'rhe camera stations are located either by angles taken from the station to surrounding triangulation points, by resecting, or by angles observed from the latter to the signal left over the camera station, by fotersecting, or by both methods combined. The final value of the work depends in a great measure upon a judicious selection of the camera stations in order to bring the relief of tlte entire terrene under proper control and to be enabled to plot all points needed for a full development of the terreue by the method of intersec· tions of horizontal lines of direction. Other methods for platting the topographic features and details are employed only when the method of intersections. fails on account of the camera stations not being well situated, or on account of an insufficiency of data to give the requisite number of horizontal lines of direction for a good location of points by "intersecting." Each camera station should be marked by a signal of some kind before leaving it, not to be shown on the pictures, but to be observed upon with the transit or altazimuth from other stations in order to locate the correct position of the camera station on the platting or working plan. Frequently it will be of advantage to set the camera up excentrically over a triangulation station in order to include certain additional parts of the landscape in the views. The position of the excentric camera station, with reference to the triangulation point, can readily be ascertained, and should always be carefully recorded. Complete panorama sets are not taken at every camera station, it being preferred, rather, to increase the number of stations, often occupying a station to obtain a single view only, if by doing so better intersections for the icotiometric location on the platting sheet of some special feature are obtained. Multiplicity of stations demands but a small increase in labor, either in the field, in the extra observations of directions to reference points for their location, or in the iconometric plattiug in the office, and enough stations should always be occupied to give a full control of the relief of the area t-0 be surveyed. A certain section of the terrene may be so located that it will be difficult matter to select more than one station whence it may be. seen. In such a case the method of "vertical intersections" may often become useful: Two or more views of such area are taken from stations at different elevations, the greater the difference in altitude between such stations the longer will the base line be, and the better are the intersections which locate the features in question, if the latter are not too far away. As enough plates should be exposed to cover the ground completely, the camera stations will have to be distributed in such a way that all valleys, sinks, and depressions, that may be represented in the scale of the map, are well controJled (i, e., seen from different camera stations). It is evident, therefore, that the number of stations to be occupied for the phototopographic development of a certain area will depend in a great measure upon the character of the terrene and upon the scale of the chart. Two or three well-defined points (so-called reference points) in each panorama view (covered by one plate) are observed with the transit or altazimuth noting and recording the vertical and horizontal angles upon the outline sketch made f 1r every plate exposed. Such sketches serve to identify points with far more certainty than a mere designation or description -0f the points observed upon. The general triangulation notes are kept in the usual manner. Vertical angles are observed to check the position of the horizon line on every photograph and to correct ~rrorl'! due to small changes ii} the level adjustments of the camera that may arise during the transportation of the instrument over a rough trail. The horizontal angles are needed for the location of the camera stations and for the orientation of the pictures (picture traces) on the plattmg sheet for the subsequent map construction.

(b) General rema.rks on the iconometric platting of the .mrvey.-The field notes of the phototopographic surveys made in the Northwest Territory of the Dominion of Canada by the topographical surveys branch of the department of the iuterior (under Capt. E. Deville, surveyor of Dominion lands), are platted on a scale of 1: 20000, but the maps are published on a scale of 1: 40000, with (ec1uidistant) contours of 100 feet vertical intervals. The phototopographic reconuaissancc in southeastern Alaska, executed by Dominion land surveyors under Dr. W. F. King, Alaskan boundary commissioner to Her Majesty, was platted 011 a scale of 1: 80000 and published on a scale of 1: 160000, with horizontal contours of 250 feet vertical intervals. It is assumed that the triangulation computations have been made and that the triangulation points have all been platted, and that their elevations above the adopted reference plane liave been affixed to the marked points on the platting sheet. The triangle sides of the secondary triangulation scheme (executed during the phototopographic survey) are now computed (the corrections to the horizontal angles, indicated by the closing errors, having been applied), the latitudes and departures (from every secondary point to the nearest primary station) are computed, and the secondary stations are then platted by their latitudes and departures (unless the primary triangulation sides are too long). The camera stations (not included in the seeondary triangulation scbeme) are now platted with reference to the triangula:tion points, using a table of chords or a station pointer (three-arm vernier protractor). If many points had been observed upon from the camera station, tbe borizontal angles are preferably laid off on a piece of tracing paper, and this improvise<l multi-arm protractor is used like a station poiuter to locate the station. The surveyor should endeavor to obtain at least one direction from a triangulation station to every camera station; tbe (iconometric) platting will then be less troublesome and more accurate. Photographs should not be used for platting the positions of camera stations, as this would not locate tbem with sufficient precision, and enough angles should always be observed in the field to locate every occupied station in tbe manner just mentioned. From the original negatives copies are made, enlarged to 9~ by 13 inches on beavy bromide paper, more recently, however, a special brand of bromide paper, known as ''platino-bromide," lias been used by Captain Deville. The enlargement adopted in Canada for these bromide prints is about 2.1 times larger than the negatives, which ratio was selected to utilize the full width of the paper found in market. These bromide enlargements are used extensively in the map constructfou, and they should be made witb great care to reduce distortion to a mimmurn. Before using the prints for the map construction any distortion due to the enlarging process should be ascertained, which is done in the following manner:

Transfer tl1e point to P' and cl1eck the length P'G and P'J in the same way. If the print satisfies all these ti sts, it may be nsed for the iconometric platting; if it does 1101, it is returned to tbe photographer with a·request for a better one. (c) Platting the picture traces.-Every photograph contains at least one, generally several, (1f the triangulation points platted on the workiug sheet, and the traces of both the picture plane and principal plane are found and platted on the plan as follows:

The distance, or principal line PS, fig. 59, is made equal to the focal length of the picture, and the image point a of the point A is projected upon the principal line (=a) and upon the horizon line (=a'). .If S 1 represeuts the platted position of the camera station Son the plan, and if S1 A 1 represents the horizontal <lirectiou on tlle plan from S to A, we make S1a1 = Sa' (taken from the photograph) allll from a 1, as center, with a a ( = Pa') as radius, describe a circle to which S 1p is drawn tangent, then S 1 p =trace of principal plane and the perpendicular to S 1p through a 1 = pa1 = trace of picture plane.

Another simple method, avoiding the drawing of constructive lines on the plan, iP as follows: Take a triangle of bard rubber or wood and mark off along one side the focal distance SP, fig. 5!l, of the print, = ab, fig. 61, and carefully notch the triangle sicle at b so that the center of a fine needle, marking the platted station point, will just flt into the notch. From the print, fig. 5!l, take the abscissa of the pictured point a= aa =Pa' between the points of a pair of diYiderg, move the triangle, fig. en', a.bout the needle (which marks the platted station) with the left band until ac, fig. 61, is equal to the distance a.'l held between the points of the dividers. The triangle is held securely in this position and lines are drawn along the triangle sides ab and ac. Prolong ac beyond ii and check the distance ac again to be= aa. The line be represents the horizontal direction from a r---=--!'--~----. the platted station b to the platted reference point c (on the negative, fig. 5(), the picture of the corresponding reference point is a). We will 11ow have: ba =trace of the principal plane, ac = trace of the picture plane, a = projection of the principal point on the platting sheet. The trace of the principal plane (=ab) is preferably marked on the platting sheet by a short line only, bearing an arrow pointing toward the platted station (b) when~e the picture was taken, and the principal point a is marked to correspond with the designation of the print. It may be '' remarked here that as few lines as possible are drawn on the platting '' ·· sheet to avoid confusion and mistakes. (See photograph board.) (d) Tlte identification of picturecl points on several photographs representing identical points of tlte terrene.-The topographic survey being fiC·. 6! platted mainly by the intersections of horizontal directions, points controlling the relief of the same arl'a must be identified on sets of pictures taken from different stations. When selecting such pointi:> on a photograph preference should be given to those which best define the surface relief or terreue, like characteristic points of ridges, peaks, saddles, changes of slope, changes in the river courses, etc., each point being marked by a dot in red ink on the photograph and haying a number or symbol affixed to it. It will now be necessary to identify as many of these points as possible on other photographs, covering the same area, and these are similarly marked by red dots, and identical points are given the same designation"by number or symbol in red ink. The identification itself' of points on several pictures offers no serious difficulties, and, with some practice, as many points as may be needed for a full development of the terrene, even under different illumination of the pictured areas, may be picked out with rapidity aud certainty. (e) Application of Professor Hauck's method /01· the identification of pictnred points.-Iu cases of doubt, when attempting to identify the same point on two different photographs, beginners may take advantag·e of Professor Hauck's method, which has been described in Chapter I, Paragraph VII. The two photographs are pinned side by side on a drawing board. The images of the camera. stations whence the pictures were obtained are '' kernelpoints," and if they fall outside of the picture limits they are determined from the ground plan and platted on the drawing board. The parallels to the principal lines of the photographs on which the scales are to be laid off are drawn in the manner explained in Chapter I and the scales are fixed in position. A fine needle is now i11serted into each of the "kernelpoints" and the loop at one end of a fine silk thread is dropped over each needle, the other end of the thread being secured by a slender rubber band to a small paper weight (fig. Cl2). A well-defined point is now identified on both photographs, sufficiently far from tbe "kernel points," aud one thread is moved by taking the paper weight up and passing its thread, under gentle tension of the rubber baud, through the point just identified on the photograph, when the weight is deposited upon the drawing board, holding the thread in the given position. The E<ame operation is repeated with the other silk thread and the other photograph, when the two threads should intersect the scales at identical division marks. If they do not, one of the scales is to be moved until both threads bisect the same division marks of the scales.

.

686

UNITED STATES COA8T ANV GEODETIC SURVEY.

Now the identification of the doubtful points may be proceelled with. Having selected a point on one of the photographs, the corresponding silk thread is moved to bisect that point, noting the position of the thread with reference to the scale in this position. 'l'he other thread is moved to bisect the corresponding graduation mark on the second scale, when this thread will also bisect the corresponding point on the second photograph. (f) Platting the intersect-ions of horizontal directions to pictured points.-After enough pictures have been selected to control the cartographic development of a certain area and the identification and marking of corresponding points have been completed, projections of all these points on the horizon lines of the pictures are marked (their abscissIB are measured) and transferred to the straight edge of a ~trip of paper, including the marking 011 the paper strip of the principal poi11t of every photograph. Each paper strip bears the same designation (in red ink) as the picture to ' which it belongs. 'l'hese strips are now placed upon the platting sheet on the picture traces to which they beloug in such a manner that the principal points of paper strips and picturn traces coincide, and in this position tliey w b are securely held to the working sheet by means of small tlmmb tacks or paper weights. To plat the horizontal projections of a point, shown and marked on two prints, two fine needles are inserted into the platted station points I and JI, fig. 62 (of the two prints) and a fine silk thread atH'.z: tached to a small paper weight w (by fine rubber band b) is secured to each needle by a loop. The thread attached to station needle I is now moved over the weighted paper strip (indicating the picture trace on the plan) until it bisects the liorizontal projection a' Fic;.62 of the picture point a. The weight is now placed upon the working plan, holding this thread (under slight tension) in this positio11. The second thread, attached to the needle in station II, is placed over the projection a" of the image of the point A, also under tension of the rubber band. The point of intersection of the two threads will be the position on the plan of the point to be platted (=A). After this position of A upon the plan has been checked, in the same manner, by means of another photograph (thread and paper strip) taken from a third station, III, and containing the image a'" of the point A, its platted position is marked by a dot i.ti red ink and its designation corresponding with that given on the prints is also affixed . .After a sufficient number of points have been platted in this manm,rr by intersections, and after they have all been supplied with the letters or numerals given them on the prints, their elevations are determined and also added in red ink. Frequently the designation of the points by letters or symbols are only added in pencil on the working sheet, to be erased after the elevations of the points have been affixed to them in red ink. When the strips of paper should overlap each other, as shown in fig. 63, the part OD of the picture trace PQ is marked off on the strip JIJN lying under PQ, the paper strip PQ is placed hi proper position, and the marks on its edge are transferred to the line OD. The strip PQ is now placed nuder MN, the marks on the latter along OD serving the same purpose as those of PQ.

When a station, A, fig. 64, falls so close to the edge of tho working board that the trace QR (of the picture plane) falls outside of' the limits of the plan, then the trace AO of the principal plane is produced to B, making AB= A 0 = focal length of the picture, and JlfN is drawn perpendicular to BO or parallel to QR. The line JlfN will, with reference to QR, occupy the same position as the focal plane of the camera does to the picture plane of the perspective. The direction of a point of the photograph projected in Q on the picture trace is M found by joining NA and produciug to the opposite Hide of A. As mentioned before, t,he i11tcrsection of the first two liues of direction should be checked either by a third line or otherwise before tlie position on the plan of a pictured point should be accepted as correct. Such intersections may, for instance, be checked by determining the height of the point from both photographs. Unless correctly platted and correctly identified, the two values for its height will not agree. This check, however, docs not guard against slight errors iu platting. A check may also be obtained by drawing a Iiue, on which the point is situated, with the perspectograph or perspectometer, but the best cbeck will always be a third intersecting line of direction from a third station. p (g) Platting pictured points iconometricallv by vt:rtical intersections.-We had seen ho\v the base line between two stations is projected into borizontal plan for the method of horizontal intersections hitherto considered, but when two camera stations are occupied at different elevations (and close together horizontally) to locate features of the terrene by intersections, the so-called "method of vertical intersections" is employed. With this method the base line (its horizontal projection being either too short or more frequently falling into t.Jie directio11 in which the points to be located iconometrically are situateu) is projected upon a vertical plane. The greater the difference in elevation between the two stations, the greater the length of this base-line projection in vertical plane, and also the better the location of tl1e points by vertical intersections will be. Vile will have with reference to fig. 65: A and B =positions of the two camera stations, platted upon the working sheet. (A is more elevated than B). aB = horizontal projection of the base line AB. As and BN =two negatives (showing the images dA and d 0 of the same point D) exposed· at the stations A and B respectively. HAnHAn' and H 8 H u' =picture traces of the fl G. G4. two negatives on the ground plane or working sheet. al\' = BPu' =focal length of the negatives AN and Br;. We will assume that the horizontal plane passing tl1rough the lower station (B) is the ground or platting plane, and the principal plane of the negative A may be taken as the vertical plane of projection. JI AnH An' will then be the trace of the picture plane As on the ground plane.. Furthermore, the principal plane, of which aPA' is the trace in the ground plane, is supposed to be revolved about aP/ into the ground or platting plane in order to simplify the construction. To plat the position in the ground plane of a point D, pictured on As and BN as dA and d 8 respectively, the rays AdA and Bd 0 are projected upon the vertical plane (revolved about aPA' into the ground plane) when (di), in fig. 65, will represent their point of intersection d, projected into the vertical plane= d,, and revolved about aPA' into the platting plane= (d1 ). The ray AdA =AD intersects or penetrates the picture plane AN at a distance = dAdAn' vertically above d/, on its picture trace HAull Ae' (ground line of picture AN)· 'fhis ordinate is laid off upon PA'JIAn =PA' (dA), when (dA) will be the projection on the vertical plane of the pictured point dA. The vertical through a projected upon the vertical plane is represented as a (A), and if we make a (A)= 1\PAn' (of picture AN)= d1fl'ere11ce in elevation between the two stations A and B,

then (A) will be the upper camera station A projected into the vertical plane, and the line connecting A with the point (dA), just found, will be the projection into vertical plane of tl.te ray A.dA or AD (revolved about aPA' with the vertical plane into the platting plane). The ray B~ = BD intersects the second picture plane BN in dn. If we draw through du' (projection of d 8 in ground line HnHu') a perpendicular to aP/ = dn'd1 8 , then din will be the projection into the vertical plane of the horizontal projection in the picture trace of the picture

(h) Iconometric determination of elevations.-Generally speaking, one perspective will not suffice to determine the height of a point, although there are exceptions, like the points on the horizon line, which have the same elevation as the camera station. With reference to fig. 66 we have: d1 =horizontal projection of the point D. Bd1 =horizontal distance between platted station Band platted position d of point D (measured in platting scale on working sheet). Bd1n =horizontal distance between station B and projection of pictured point d 8 in ground line Hu H 11 1, measured on platting sheet. d1 8 (du)= h =ordinate of pictured point du above ground line (revolved with vertical plane about Bd1 11 into platting plane), measured

Measured on the platting scale, it will give the height of D above the camera horizon (ground plane= horizon plane). The height His a fourth proportional to the three known lengths Bd 1, Bd 111 , and d 1u (d 11 ).' After projecting the plat.ted point d and the pictured point d 11 into the principal plane, and after revolving the latter about the f!rincipal line BP into the platting, or ground plane we ' will have: P (du')= h =height of pictured point d 11 above the platting plane.

where OC =focal length of the photograph, and open the arms of the sector until the second point of the dividers coincides with ihe corresponding division D of the other arm of the sector (OD being equal to OC =focal length), now add the length d 1' P, fig. 66 (horizontal distance of the platted point_d 1 to the picture trace Jl 11 Hu' projected into vertical plane), to the focal length =f = OC, fig. G7, by placing one point of the dividers in O, when the other point may coincide with the division A of the scale 00. Hold the sector unchanged, turn the dividers about the point A, and bring the second point to the graduation mark B of scale OD, B corresponding to A, or OB= OA; when AB will represent the height Hof the point d above the horizon plane of the station B, to be measured on the platting scale. D (i) Iconometric detennination of elevations by means of the so-called ·,,scale of heights."-Another method consists in making use of the "scale of heights," fig. 68. Make SP=f =focal length of the perspective, erect PA perpendicular to SP in P, and divide both lines into equal parts. Draw radials from S through the points of division on PA, aud through those of SP draw parallels to PA. Now, with a pair of dividers take from the photograph the distance from the pictured point to the horizon line (the ordinate of the pictured point correB A sponding to P(d'b) = h, in fig. 66) and transfer it to PA from P = Pµ. The position of µ may be found to correspond to the line Sp, passing through the point 9 of the graduation on PA. With a pair of dividers take now (from the platting sheet) the vertical f'IG.69 distance from the horizontal projection of the point to the picture trace ( = od, in fig. 66) and transfer it to the right or left of P according at1 the point of the plan falls beyond the picture trace or between the platted station and the picture trace. In fig. 68 it is shown as falling between the station and the picture trace into m. The line mB, drawn parallel with PA, is intersected by the radial S1-1 (corresponding to scale division mark 9) in M. The distance mM, measured on the platting scale, will be the height of the point above (or below) the station. A scale, fig. 69, is conveniently pinned somewhere, perpendicularly to a line AB, the division C of the scale, corresponding to AB, being the height of the camera station. One point of a pair of dividers with which the length AB was taken off the "sector," or with which the length null

was taken off the ''scale of heights," is set in O, fig. 69, and the division mark ]) of the scale, coinciding with the other point of the dividers, will indicate the height of the poittt above the plane of reference or datum plane. · This height is entered in pencil on the plan, inclosed in a smaJl circle, to distinguish it from the number of the station. It is checked by means of a second photograph, and when the discrepancy between the two values for the elevation of the point is within the permissible limits of error, their mean value is entered in red ink on the plan and all pencil figures are erased. Any marked difference in the value for the height of a point obtained from two photographs would indicate either that the two points selected on the photographs do not represent the same point of the terrene, or that an error in platting or in finding the height had been made. A third intersecting line from a third station would dispose of the first two alternatives, and a new measurement of the height will show whether an error had beel1 made, or whether the discrepancy is due to unavoidable errors. (j) The use of the so-called "photograph board."-The various constructions described in the preceding pages, if made directly on the platting sheet and on the photographs, would produce confusion in the iconometric platting, owing to the intricacy of the lines, and would obscure many details in the pictures. Captain Deville, therefore, has hada special drawing board prepared on which as many of the construction lines are drawn, once for i. R all, as would have to be repeated for the different prints of uniform size and which had been B c. obtained with the same camera. This so-called "photograph board" is an ordinary drawing board, covered with tough drawing paper, the surface of which is to represent alternatively either the picture plane E or the principal plane (both revolved into the horizon plane). It is used in conjunction with the photographs or negatives. Two Jines, DD' and SS', fig. 70, are drawn at right angles to FIG.70 each other. They represent the horizon and principal lines, while PD= PD'= PS' =f =focal length, so that D, D', S, and S' are the left, right, lower, and upper distance points, respectively. Tho photograph is placed iu the center of the board, the principal line coinciding with SS' and the horizon line with DD', in which position ( TYZO) it is secured to the board by means of small thumb tacks or pins. The four scales, forming the sides of the square OTYZ, serve, among other purposes, to locate Jines para1le1 either with SS' or DD' (without actua1ly drawing the parallels) on the photograph, the latter falling within the limits of the square OTYZ. At a suitable distance from the distance point ]) 1 a perpendicular QR is drawn, on which are marked hy means of a table of tangents the angles formed with DQ by lines drawn from D. This scale may be used for measuring the altitudes or azimuthal angles of points of the photograph, as will be explained in a separate paragraph later. From Sas a center with SP =f =focal length an arc of a circle PL is described and divided into equal parts. Through these points of division, and betwee'!l PL and PD', lines are drawn converging to S. ParallelH MN to the principal line are also drawn, as shown in fig. 70. All these lines are used in connection with the scale of degrees and minutes QR.

The studs of the "centro lineads" (to be mentioned later) are fixed in A, B, C, and E, the lines AB and OEjoining their centers, and those required for adjusting the centro lineads are drawn on the photograph board to be used as will be explained in a later paragraph.· The square FGKH is constructed on the four distance points S, S', D', and D. ' (k) Construction of the traces of a figure's plane.-If one wishes to use a perspective instrument for converting a figure-situated in an inclined plane of which the perspective (photograph) is given-into the projection of the figure, into horizontal plan, it will be necessary to locate the traces of the figure's plane on the principal and picture planes.

We may distinguish betwMn two cases that frequently arise in practical work. (1) The inclined plane, containing the. figure, may be given by the line of greatest slope, or, (2) The inclined plane may be given by three or more points. First case: The inclined plane containing the figure is given by its line of greatest slope; this may be an inclined road, the drainage line of a straight valley, the trend of a torrent, the surface of a live glacier, etc. This line of greatest slope may be represented 011 the pla11 by a line ab, fig. 71, the altitude of a being known. After the photograph has been pinned to the photograph board, the ground line XY is <lrawn, taking the horizontal plane through a as the ground plane. On the platting board aO is drawn through a perpendicular to the horizontal projection ab of the line of greatest. slope, and it is produced to its intersections L and 0 with the principal line S1p1 and with the picture trace X 1Y1.

On tlrn pl10tograph pE is made equal to p 1b; at E a perpendicular to XY is erected and produced to the intersection fJ with the pictured line of greatest slope. If we uow make pN(on the photograph) = p 1o (of the plan) and join Nj3 on the picture, the line Nj:J will represent the trace of the required plane (the figure's plane) on the picture plane. If pQ (on the photograph) is made equal to p 1L (of the plan) and Q joined with M, MQ will represent the trace of the required plane in the priucipal plane, revolved about SS' (on the photograph board) into the picture plane, the station S falling in D. Producing MQ to R, DR will represent the vertical distauce of the station S above the plane

Second case: The inclined plane containing the figure is given by three points. Take for ground plane the horizontal plane containing one of the points a, fig. 72, and draw the ground line XY on the photograph. On the platting ~beet join a to the two remaining points, band c, and produce these lines ab and ac to the intersections E and F with the picture trace. On the photograph make p 1K equal to pE and draw KL perpendicular to XY. Join the perspectives a and fJ of the points shown in a and b on the plan and produce to the intersection with KL. Make p 1T equal to pF, draw TN perpendicular to XY, and produce to the intersection N with the line joining the perspectives a and y (of a and c). Join N and L, when NL will represent the trace of the required plane on the picture plane. Produce LN to 0 and· make pG =Pi O; join <t and G and make Pi Q =pH. The Iiue MQ will represent the trace of the required plane on the principal plane, revolved about SS' into the picture plane, the station S being uow in D. Here again DR is the vertical distance of station S above the plane containing the three given points a, b, and c.

(l) Oontouring.-After the heights of a sufficient number of points have been determined to give a good development of the terrene that is to be mapped, the contour lines are drawn in by interpolation between.the points of which the elevations had been established. In a moderately rolling country a limited number of points of known elevations will suffice to draw the contour lines with precision; but in a rocky region, where abrupt changes and irregular forms predominate, it is almost impossible to plat enough control points to enable the iconometric draftsman to render a faithful representation of the relief of the broken terrene, and it is here that a close study of the photographs will give the greatest assistance in modifying the courses of the contours to represent the characteristic features of the terrene. The value of photographic views for a correct or naturalistic delineation of the topography of a given area is generally acknowledged by experienced topographers, even when usi11g

instrumental methods alone for the control work, as a minute study of the pictured terrene (the photographs) will always aid the-draftsman (when inking the topographic sheet) to draw the contours (of which the main deflections had been located ·instrumentally) with a more natural and artistic reproduction of nature's forms than could be attained by mechanically inking the penciled lines as obtained solely by instrumental measurements. Instead of drawing the contour lines at once on the plan, the draftsman may begin by sketching them on the photographs, following the same rules for their location as if he were drawing them on the plan, for the image of every platted point is already marked on the photograph and its elevation may be taken from the working plan. By following this course lie will be enabled to follow the inequalities of the surface very closely. Those perspectives of the contours

on the pictures will greatly facilitate their horizontal projections to be drawn upon the plan. They may also be transferred to the plan by means of the perspectograph or perspectometer if accuracy is to give place to rapidity. A sufficient number of tertiary points having been platted by intersections, there will be no difficulty in drawing the contour lines (by interpolation) between such points. It may happeu, however, that the number of the control points is too small and that the latter are too far apart to give a good definition of the terrene (as in a topographic reconnaissance), and then it will become necessary to resort to other (frequently less accurate) methods for locating the coutours on the plan. For example, the ridge a b c d of a mountain range appearing as a fJ y o on a photograph, fig. 73, may be divided by the contour planes by assuming it to be contained in a vertical plane.

On the plan, fig. 73, we produce the projection ad of the ridge to the intersection F with the picture trace X 1 Y1 and draw through the projection S, of the station S10 parallel to ad. The photograph having been pinned to the photograph board, take from the principal point Pon the horizon line J> V = p 1 0 and PG= p 1F. At G place the scale of equidistanccs perpendicular to the horizon line, the division at G corresponding to the height of the station, and join the marks of the scale to the vanishing point Y. Having now the successive points of intersection of the ridge by the successive contour planes, their distances from the principal line SS'-their abscissm-are marked upon the edge of a strip of paper in the l:sual manner. 'rbe intersection of the radials from S, through the points marked on the paper strip with the projection a . . d of the ridge a . . y will give the intersections 6f the contour lines.

Should the mountain have rounded forms and no well-defined ridge, the visible outline on the photograph may be assumed to be contained in a vertical plane perpendicular to the line of direction draw1\ to the middle of the ridge outline. The construction, fig. 74, is made by drawing the line of direction SJl1 to the middle of the ridge outline and S V perpendicular to SM. On the plan p 1 .11f1 is made = P1lf, and from the projection a of the summit a of the mountain a perpendicular ac to S 1 11!1 is drawn, which will represent the horizontal projection (ac) of the pictured outline (ay); it is produced t-0 the intersection N with the picture trace X1 Y 1· PQ is taken (on the photograph) equal top 1N (on the plan), and the scale of equidistances is placed at Q perpendicular to the horizon hne DD'. The division mark at Q corresponds with the elevation of the station S, and the points of division corresponding with the contours are joined to Vand produced to their intersections with.the outline a . . y. The platti11g is done as in the preceding case, or the lines of direction drawn to the points of intersection of the outline ay by the contour planes may simply be platted and the contour lines on the plan may lie drawn tangent to these lines of direction. The horizon line, containing the perspectives of all points bavi11g the same elevation as the station, represents the perspecF1 c;. 75 tive of a contour line wh~n the camera horizon is identical with a contour plane. The c 5' icouometric draftsman should l(.) pay particular attention to geologic forms and to the origin of topographic features, as without such applied knowledge a T '( correct interpretation of such forms and their cartographic representation would require the cartographic location of a a.

F" D' B D vast number of control points to obtain a faithful represen\ ' tation of the terrene forms. 0 Although the latter may often \ result from the successive or combined actions of many agen\ cies, they will yet have similar '.S recurrent characteristic shapes when produced by the same causes, and the contours, being. the means for delineating the cartographic representation of tbe terrene sliaped by identical agencies, should also show a corresponding characteristic similarity. (m) The photograph protractor.-The angle includefl between the line of direction (to a point of a photograph) and the horizon, or the. principal 1)lane-the vertical or altitude and the hori· zontal or azimuth angle-is sometimes wanted. The horizontal angle may be obtainerl directly 011 the photograph lloard lly joining the station S, fig. 75, and the projection a (011 the horizon line) of the pictured point a. If required i11 arc measure, the distance Pa may be transferred to the principal line SS' from P =PG; ]) is joi11ed to G and produced to the scale of degree8 and minutes BC, where the graduation mark k indicates the value of the horizontal angle in arc measure. When manysuchanglesaretollemeasured, thehorizontalscales TYand OZ, fig. 75, maybe divided into degrees and minutes by means of a table of tangents, using as radius the focal leugth SP. The altitude is the vertical angle at S of the right-angle triangle, having for sides Sa and a:Y. To construct it, take DF = Sa, draw FE parallel with and equal to aa, join D and E, and produce DE to the scale BO of degrees and minutes. This construction will be facilitated by the lines already drawn on the photograph board, fig. 70. With a pair of dividers take the distance (abscissa) from the pictured point a fo the

principal line 88 1, fig. 75, and carry it from P, fig. 70, in the direction PD', and from the point so obtained take the distance to the arc ML, fig. 70, measuring in the direction of the radials marked on the board, which will represent the distance PF, fig. 75. Then, with the dividers, carry aa to FE, fig. 75, which is that ope of the parallel lines MN of fig. 70 that corresponds to the point F. The construction may now be completed in the manner already explained. A protractor may be constructeu to measure these angles directly by drawing lines on a transparent plate parallel with the principal liue-they contain points having identical azimuthsand curves containing points of identical altitudes. The azimuthal lines may be found by platting the horizontal angles in S, fig. 70, and drawing lines parallel to the principal line SS' through the points ..,of intersection of the radials with the horizon line DD'. If we regard the horizon and principal lines as axes of coordinates and denote the altituue aa of a point a pictured as a, fig. 75, by h, the equation of the curve of altitude h may be writteny2 = (x2 +P) tan 2 h. This also is the equation of an hyperbola of which the principal and horizon lines are the transverse and conjugate axes, and of which the principal point is the center. One of the hyperbola's branches represents the points above the horizon, and the other branch the points of equal altitude below the horizon. The asymptotes are lines intersecting each other at the principal point, and including angles with the horizon line equal to Ji. This hyperbola represents the trace on the picture plane of' the cone of visual rays which include the angle h with the '---; . . --~ horizon plane. These hyperbolic curves of equal altitude may be obtained by computation, using the preceding formula and p substituting different values for h, or they may be obtained H ·;!graphically by platting a series of points for each curve by reversing the construction given above for finding the altitude of the pictured point 11, fig. 75. The angular disL11 ·· . -. a:. tance between the lines representing points of equal azi- ·- .. ~ muths (or those of equal altitudes) will depend upon the degree of precision required. FIG.76 The complete protractor is shown iu fig. 76. It may be made .in the same manner as mentioned for the perspectometer by drawing it on paper on a large scale, reducing it by photography, a11d making a transparency by bleaching in bichloride of mercury. (4) Method of V. Legros for determining the position of the horizon line.-Commandant V. Legros recommends the use of these hyperbolas for locating the horizon line of a vertically exposed photographic plate: When a camera with the photographic plate adjusted in vertical plane is rotated horizontally in azimuth, the plate remaining vertical, any point a, fig. 76, will describe a hyperbola aa.' on the ground glass plate. The nearer the observed point a approaches the horizon hne the smaller the curvature of its hyperbolic trace on tl!e ground glass will become, and ·a point a 0 which traverses the ground glass plate in a straight line HH' will have the same elevation as the second nodal point of the .camera lens. Its angle of elevation will be ::!: 0 or HH' will be the horizon line of the plate. To locate the horizon line experimentally in this way the ground glass plate is best provided with a series of equidistant horizontal and vertical lines, after the manner of Dr. Le Bon's ground glass plates. (5) Method of Prof. S. Finsterwalder for locating contours on the plan.-Prof. S. Finsterwalder's method for the iconometric location of horizontal contours is based upon the following consideratioo: . The pictured outline of a terrene form is regarded as the trace of the terrene surface in a plane vertical to the platting or ground plane and containing the pictured outline. This method is well adapted for the development of' the terrene forms of a moderately rolling country. Tue camera stations are specially seh·ctt·1l with reference to the use of this method, with a

view toward obtaining pictures with a sufficient number of such outlines of the terrene forms to enable the iconometric draftsman to give a good definition of the relief of the region to be platted. Tl.te pictured outlines of terrene forms may be regarded as falling within vertical planes: and the rays from tl.te point of view-second nodal point of camera lens-to the pictured points of such outline will form a cone with apex in the point of view, its base being formed by the pictured outline. Any 110rizoutal plane conta\ning a contour A will intersect such a cone of rays in a curve R, tl.te latter touchiug A in one point. 'fhis curve B may be platted on the working sheet by laying off, upon a few rays from the platted st.atio11 to points of the pictured outline, the distance:

PHOTOGRAMM ETERS.

The practical 1,alue of a photogmmmeter (photographic surveying instrument) depends greatly upon the quality and general: uniformity of its lens or lenses, upon the rigidity of the component parts of the apparatus, its easy transportability, and on the rapidity with which it may be p1.1.t into adjustment. A ·good phototopographio lens should be free from spherical aberration (or diffusion of the light rays); it should possess no chromatic aberration, nor should the image show distortion of any kind, and the field of view (the range of lens) should be large, rapidity of the lens being desirable, but less important than the other requirements just mentioned. The principal lenses in usc for phototopographic purposes are: Dallmeye1·'s rapid rectilinear, Steinheil's aplanat, Bush's pantoscopic, Gorz's double anastigmat, and, more recently, Zeiss's anastigmat lens. The nodal points, the focal length, arc of visibility, and the arc which is perfectly free from distortion of every kind should be known for every lens used for phototopographic purposes, and the manufacturers of all good lenses are best fitted to determine those values with great precision for every lens.
I, REQUIREMENTS TO BE FULFILLED BY A TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYING CAMERA,

A good surveying camera or photogrammeter for topographic work should produce negatives which are geometrically true perspectives the elements of which should be known, and the following desiderata should be fulfilled: First. The plates to be exposed i;;hould be adjustable into vertical plane. Second. The distance between image point and sensitive plate should be maintained unchanged for all plates. Third. This distance-the constant focal length-should be known or will have to be determined for every instrument. Fourth. Means should be provided to trace or locate the horizon line upon every negative or print. Fifth. Means should be provided for l~cating the principal point upon every negative. Sixth. A ready orientation of the photographs (the picture traces) for iconometric platting should be provided for; and we may add as Sevl>nth. Enough characteristic stations (besides the triangulation points needed for the instrumental control) are to be occupied with the surveying camera to give a full development of the terrene, which is to be mapped. Until recently photographic surveying instruments were not procurable in open market. Nearly every observer who made practical application of the photographic methods for topographic surveys had an apparatus constructed for his particular need and according to bis individual ideas. In the following we will describe such pbotogrammeters as may be regarded as special types, constructed to fulfill different requirements.

Devillc's new survey· ing oumcra.-Tbe following description of the new Oauadian surveying camera·is taken from Deville's Photographic Sii1·veying, Ottawa, l 895. This camera is shown in figs . 82 and 83. Figs. 84 and 85 represent sections of the instrument. The camera proper is a rectangular metal box AB (figs. 84 and 85) open at one end. It carries the lens L and two sets of cross-levels 00, which may be observed through openings iu the outer mahogany box. The metal box is supported by wooden blocks and a frame FF, held in position by two bolts DD.

The camera rests on a metal triangular base, fig. 86, with three-foot screws, exactly like the uasc of the transit which is usecl in conjunction with Deville's camera, so that either camera or transit may be placed on the same tripod at any time. The camera may be ~et up with the longer side either horizontal or vertical, figs. 82 aud &1. Both transit and tripod are carried by the surveyor, while one camera with one dozen plates (in the single plate holders), without a tripod, are taken by one of the men who always accompany the surveyor. The assistant surveyor has a secoud camera, with 12 plates and a separate tripod. The legs of these tripods, when folded together, are 20 inches long and are placed under the box of the transit, in a separate sole-leather case, to be carried on the back of the surveyor. The tripod of the assistant surveyor's camera is similarly attached to the sole-leather case of his camera. The lens of this camera is a Zeiss anastigmat, No. 3 of series V, focal length = 14:1 millimetres with a deep-orauge color screen in front. Having set the camera up on the tripod, the plate-holder carrier Eis moved back as far as it will go by turning the screw G~ the plate holder is inserted through the opening JlfE, the slide is withdrawn, and the carrier is moved forward by revolving the screw G, until the plate is in contact with the back of the metal box AR. In order to secure a perfect contact, the carrier has a ~ertain amount FIG.86 of free motion. The camera should now be turne& in the proper direction; the field embraced by the plate is indicated by lines drawn on the outside of the mahogany box. The camera is now carefully leveled, the exposure made, and the plate holder withdrawn (after the slide had been inserted) by repeating the same operations, however, in the inverse order. The levels GO are rigidly attached to the metal camera box without any means of adjustment. They are, however, very nearly adjusted by the maker. For this purpose he takes the o 4 a l'Z. ) metal box out of the maliogany casing and 1 places it on a piece of plate glass which had I I I I I been leveled like an artificial horizon. By --------------------filing down one end or the other of the level's F1G. 87 outer case be bi:ings each bubble very nearly into the middle of its tube. These tubes have continuous numbers on the graduation marks. as illustrated in fig. 87. Accompanying ~ach camera is a piece of plate glass,:! inch thick and 11 inches long, which can be inserted into the carrier in place of the plate holder. That end of the plate glass which pr~jects outside of the camera when it is thus inserted is coated on the back with a varnish of gum guaia-. cum (dissolved in alcohol) to which some lampblack has been added. This coating has very nearly the same refractive index as glass, precluding all reflections from the back of the plate glass. When the camera is received from the maker the exact rea<ling.~ of the levels, GO, when the back of the metal box (against which the photographic plate is pressed) is vertical, should be ascertained. To do this the bolts P, fig. 85, next to the opening JI, are unscrewed and removed. Qmay then slide backwards and be taken out. The piece of coated plate ghiss is now mserted into the carrier E, figs. 8.t all(l 8.J, aud pressed into contact with the metal box by revolving the screw G. The camera is placed on its tripod and leveled. Immediately in front and at the same l1eight as the camera a transit (or a leveling instrument) T, fig. 88, is set up, and, after carefully adjusting it, a distant but well-defined point P is selected on the same level with the transit and camera. The intersection of the threads of the telescope is brought to coincide with I', and the telescope is clamped in this position to the vertical circle. 'rnrning it in azimuth the image of P, reflected by the plate glass, should apvear at the intersection of the telescope's threads. If it does, the face of the plate glass is vertical and the position of the bubble in the tube of the level, directed

at right angles to the plate glass, is the correct one for adjusting the instrument in the future. If it does not, the camera must be tilted forward or backward by means of the foot screws until coincidence is established. 'fhe bubble of the level may or may not now be in the middle of the tube, but its position, whatever it is, will be the correct one for the future when adjusting the camera at any stii-tion. This level reading should therefore be recorded, and whenever the camera is to be leveled in its subsequent use it must he remembered that the bubble is to be given tlie same position. This level reading determination is to be made for the two positions of the camera in which it is used, figs. 82 and 83, horizontal and vertical. The next step is to locate the position of the principal point on the vertical photographic plate, and to determine the length of the distance line or the constant focal length. Select a station so that a number of distant and well-defined points may be found on the horizon line, as laid down by the maker of the camera. The view selected may be the distant sl1ore of a lake, a large building, or a row of buildings. Set up the tripod and adjust the transit. Find two points E and F, fig. 89, on the horizon line (with a zenith distance of 90°) that both come within the field of the camera, when set horizontal, both points being near the edges of the plate. Measure the angle w between them. Find two other points G and H, also on the horizon line, and such a di£:tance apart that they both come within the field of the camera when the same is vertical, fig. 83. Now replace the ,...

The first plate, after development, will show the two points E and }I' on a line very nearly parallel t.o the edges AB and OD, fig: 89, of the metnl box. The principal point, of course, will be on this line. Out this line into the film with a fine needle point and straightedge. · The second plate, exposed in the vertical position, after development gives another horizon line GH, fig. 89, which may be transferred to the first plate by means of the distances AK, and OL to the corners of the metal box. This (principal) line is likewise cut through the film with a fine needle point and straightedge, the principal point P is at the intersection of both lines RI!' and GH. 'fhe length of the distance line, SP= f, fig. 90, may be computed from the observed horizontal angle w, included between SE and SF, and from the distances EP =a and PF= b, measured on the negative.

Having found the focal length and the principal point, reference marks are to be made on the edges of the metal box to indicate the horizon line, the principal line, and the focal length 011 the negatives, or on the enlargements made from the latter. · Measure the distance m, fig. 89, from P to AO.

photograph. Four of these projections serve to fix the horizon and principal lines; the remaining eight give the focal length value. It now remains necessary to find the correct readings of the transverse levels (those placed parallel with the sensitive plate), when the horizon and principal lines pass exactly through their notches of the metal box. Again set up the camera facing the same distant view as before, but in adjusting it bring the bubble of the transverse level near one end of the tube, note the level reading and expose a plate. After development it will give an horizon line EF, fig. 92, cutting the border of the negative in A and Bat some distance from the pictured notches 0 and Q. Now change the adjustment of the camera by bringing the bubble of the transverse level to tlie other end of the tube, note the level · reading and expose another plate. This will give another horizon line E' F', cutting tlie border of the negative in 0 ancl D.

Great care should be exercised in both cases to maintain the other level (the one at right angles to the sensitive plate) at its proper reading in order to expose both plates in vertical plan. After measuring 00 and OA or BQ and QD, a simple proportion will give the proper reading of the transverse level, which will bring the horizon line of the vertically exposed plate through the two notches 0 and Q of the metal box. The correct.reading of the other transverse level is found by the same method, with the camera in the vertical position, fig. 83. All these operations must be executed with great care and precision, and with the help of a microscope of moderate power, as the subsequent iconometric platting of pictured points is based upon the determination of the ordinates and abscissre of such points on the photographs, with reference to the principal and horizon lines, as a system of rectangular coordinates. It had been assumed that the levels were placed very nearly in correct adjustment by the maker, as previously mentioned. If found too much out, they should of course be first approximately adjusted by setting the metal box on a leveled plate. For this purpose the plate glass sent out with every instrument is set on the camera base and leveled like an artificial horizon. (3) Use of the instruments comprised in the Oanadian phototopographic outjit.-The instruments and tripod being made as light as possible, steadiness is secured by a net suspended betw'eeu the tripod legs in which a heavy stone is placed. With this device better photographs and more precise observations itre obtained, and there is no risk of the instruments (resting upon the tripod) being blown over during one of the sudden and strong gusts of wind so frequently encountered on elevated peaks in the mountains. · After having arrived at a triangulation station, the surveyor adjusts the transit and observes the azimuth and zenith distances of all signals marking the triangulation and camera stations that may be visible from his position. If accompanied by his assistant, each reads one vernier and both enter the readings in record books. After completion of the observations they compare notes. Any discrepancy that may be discovered in the recorded data is corrected on the spot. The camera is carried in a sole-leatlier case containing also twelve fl.lied plate holders. When more plates are needed they (with the necessary holders) must be carried in a separate receptacle. Taking the camera out of the cltse, the leveling base, fig. 86, is screwed to it, and the camera is then placed upon the tripod, from which the transit had been removed, without disturbing the position of the tripod; the shade or hood is now unfolded and attached to the hooks at the front of the camera, fig. 82. A plate holder is inserted into the carrier, and its number is recorded upon a rough o.utline sketch of the view commanded by the field of the camera image, entering also such notes as may be of value for the development of the plate and for the iconometric platting of the topography recorded upon it (by the action of the light). Having made sure that the cap is on the lens, the slide is withdrawn from the plate holder and the plate is brought into contact with the frame of the metal box by turning the screw G, figs. 84 and 85, devised for this purpose. The surveyor now turns the camera in azimuth until. the lines on the upper face of tile wooden c.asing show that it is properly directed or oriented to include the panorama section to be photographed between the lines, the field of view coinciding with the outline sketch bearing the number of the plate holder in the camera. Sighting along the oonvergiug lines, shown oii the side.face of the wooden camera casing, he can assure himself whether the view on the image plu.te reaches high or low enough. If it does not, he will put the longer dimension of the camera upright, unless the camera was already in that position. He levels carefully, in the manner previously described, and exposes the plate. Whenever the sun shines inside of the front hood it should be shaded off during the exposure of the plate by holding something above the hood. Under no circumstances should the sun be permitted to shine upon the lens. Every evening, after returning to the survey camp, the surveyor replaces the exposed plates in his dark tent by new ones, using a ruby-colored light. He also marks the exposed plates in one corner, before removal from the holder, with his initials, the number of the dozen and of the plate (the same number a.s given to the corresponding outline sketch), using a soft lead pencil for this purpose; e.g., IV, 5, means· plate No. 5 of the fourth dozen, or the forty-first plate. The exposed plates are now placed into a double tin box, fig. 93, which can be closed hermetically, and which will float when filled with two dozen plates, should the same be accidentally thrown into 6584-45

water. These boxes are shipped to the head office in Ottawa, where the plates are developed by a specialist. The data obtained with the aid of the transit for triangulation purposes are recorded in the field book in the usual manner, as customary for such work. The horizontal angles observed with the transit (or altazimuth instrument) to the points of the terrene marked on the outline sketch which accompanies each negative, serve not only for the orientation of the horizontal projection of the plate on the plan (the so-called "picture trace"), but they also serve to counteract in a measure and to ascertain the distortion of the paper prints (or photographic enlargements). The vertical angles, together with the platted distauces, are used to check and verify the position of the horizon line on the different photographs. The most important camera stations are occupied by the surveyor; the secondary stations by the assistant surveyor, with his own camera. No trigonometric observations are made by the assistant while occupying the secondary stations . .A.11 views are taken with the same stop: f/36. (4) The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey camera.The original type of the Coast and Geodetic Survey camera, used in connection with the Alaskan boundary survey, was similar in form to Deville's original camera, except that it had a special tripod with ball and socket adjustment and that the teeth which serve to mark the principal and horizon lines on the negative could be turned by revolving one button to be pressed into contact with the photographic plate. This camera was also provided with a ground glass, &!CTIO"' enabling the surveyor to inspect the entire field controlled by 01"" SHIPPING F"tG.93 each plate before exposure, and giving ready means for test&Olio iug the positions of the teeth which mark the horizon line. The camera itself was a plain rectangular box made of well-seasoned mahogany 6~ 'by 5~ by 9!- inches in size, and it A.IR SPACE. was used always in the same position, with the short faces verlical. The bamboo tripod legs were composed of three pieces, each 16 inches long, and screwed together a.t the joints. When dismembered the tripod was carried in a sole-leather packing case together with the camera, twelve plates (in six double plate holdel's), notebook, barometer, thermometer, yellow color screen, etc. The new phototopographic camera of the Coast and Geodetic Survey is a phototheodolite, resembling Colonel Laussedat's latest pattern which will ~e described in the following pages.
IV. SURVEYING CAMERAS OOMllINED WITH GEODE'.rIO INSTRUMENTS.

(Phototheodolites, photographic 1ilane tables, etc.)

The data acquired in the field with photogrammeters of the class just described had to be supplemented with observations made in the field with some geodetic instrument (transit, plane table, etc.) in order to obtain complete topographic surveys of the regions traversed by the phototopographic surveying party. 'fhe idea of combining surveying instruments with a photographic camera into single compact and serviceable instruments originated very early with phototopographic workers, and l'efined phototheodolites and photographic plane tables are to this day the favorite phototopograpbic iustruments in Europe, whence they are also exported to other countries. These more or less complicated instruments have been devised to seeure great precision in the work undertaken with them, aud refined methods are employed for the field observatious, for the culling of data from the photographic perspeetives, and for the computations made in the office to increase the general precision of data derived from the operations executed in the field. Generally speaking, the best results for topographic purposes are obtained by means of photography, if we bear in mind that phototopography essentially and primarily is a constructive and graphic art, based upon graphic or pictorial records ( wllich are nothing more than central

projections in-vertical plan of objects and their dimensions, that are to be transposed graphically into orthogonal projections into horizontal plan). Instrumental observations being required only to furnish such elements as may be needed to make the graphic transpositions (iconometric platting in a reduced scale) of the lines of directions and distances, and also to obtain checks or a proper control for the work in its entirety. Photographic surveys have been conducted principally in regions where other surveying

methods are either precluded or where their application would entail great cost and consume too much time, and such regions are characterized chiefly by a rugged and broken topography. The necessity, therefore, lies close at band to devise instruments that will not readily get out of adjustment or drop to pieces when transported over rugged mountain trails, and the more simplified their structural composition the more available will they become for the production of rapid and accurate work. · It is at once evident that the combination of a camera and a surveying instrument into a wellunited, well-balanced, easily manipulated, and essentially light ancl withal rigid instrument is not easily accomplished. It is not surprising therefore, when searching the published descriptions of

phototheodolites and other photogrammeters, to come upon a great number of types in which the many difficulties have been overcome, more or less successfully, by various devices. We may find: A large-sized theodolite with a small camera, placed centrally between the v supports, after .removal of the telescope from the latter, both being interchangeable; A large camera mounted upon the horizontal circle with a telescop·e and vertical circle attached eccentrically (at either side of the camera); .A large centrically located camera, the lens of which serves at the same time as objective of the telescope, the corresponding eyepiece being at the center of the frame that ordinarily supports the ground glass plate (in this form the camera itself is the telescope); Instruments where the board of the plane table has been replaced by a surveying camera, the upper face of which receives and supports .the plane-table sheet and plane-table alidade; also various other combinations (some with compass attacliments). This class of instruments has been in use for large scale surveys and where the in~tru mental outfit could readily be brought very near the stations to be occupied by convenient means of transportation, the instruments rarely being subjected to such primitive and rough methods of transportation over long distances, as it generally has been the case on our continent when surveying cameras have been used. (1) The new Italian phototheod o lite, devised by L. P. Paganini. - Paganini's· model of 1884 has been described in .Appendix: No. 3, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1893. The following description of Paganini's new phototheodolite, model of 1890, has been extracted from L. P. Paganini's "Nnovi appunti di fototopografia," Roma, 189!: The general form and the dimensions of the camera box: of Paganini's new phototheodolite remain about the same as with the older model, the principal change resting in the omission of the eccentric telescope which has been replaced by the centrally mounted camera, which ,may, at will of the observer, be converted into a telescope. The telescopes which we generally find attached to surveying instruments consist of a tube, slightly conical in shape, having a positive lens or a system of convergent lenses at one· end (the "objective") which produce within the telescope a· real and inverted image-the same as the camera lenS-of any object toward which the lens may be directed. The other, smaller end of

REPORT FOR 1897-PART IJ.

APPENDIX NO. 10.

709

the telescope tube, has a still smaller tube inserted into it which may be moved in the direction of the axis of the tube. This second tube also contains a system of convergent lenses-so-called "ocular lens" or "eyepiece" of the telescope-which serve to project an enlargement of the image in the telescope upon the retina of the observer's eye. In the image plane of the objective (within the telescope), is the so-called diaphragm-a ring-shaped metal disk-to one side of which a pair of cross hairs-spider webs, cocoon threads, or lines cut into a 'thin piece of plate glass-is attached in such a way that the hairs fall within the image plane. One hair is vertical and the other horizontal, their point of intersection coinciding with the optical axis of the telescope. The old camera was provided with the objective, and a corresponding eyepiece had only to be added 0===0=== 0 ===0===7! to convert the camera into a surveying telescope. In the instrument under consideration the eyepiece consists of a positive lens set, known in optics as 0 "Ramsden's ocular lens." The inner wall surfaces of the camera box should be well blackened to avoid any side reflection and a consequent dimness in the appearance of the cross wires. The camera proper consists of two parts, a truncated pyramid A, figs. 94 to 98, and a cylindrical attachment B, into which the tube t is inserted. A second tube within the cylinder t may be moved in the direction of the optical axis by means of a screw, the threads of which have a rise of one millimetre. By revolviug the inner tube the lens is brought nearer to or farther from the image plane, the lens remaining parallel with the image plane at any position that may thus be given to the lens. 0 A scale a., figs. 94 and 98, graduated to millimetres, is permanently attached to the tube t and it lies very close to the ring n, the circumference of which is divided into ten equal parts. (This graduated ring n is soldered upon the cylinder u containing the camera lens.) This scale a (extending in a direction parallel to the optical axis of the lens) has a mark, coinciding with the index rim of the ring n, thus indicatiug the focal length of the camera lens when focused upon objects at infinite distance. The millimetre graduation of' the scale a, extending from the zero mark in the direction toward the ground· glass serves to ascertain the focal lengths for objects nearer the camera station. 'rhe circumferential graduation on the ring n serves to read one-tenth of one revolution of the tube 1l, which is equal to au axial motion of the lens of O·l millimetre, hence the focal 'length for any object focused upon may be read to single millimetres on the scale a and to tenths of a millimetre on the graduated ring n. 'rhe construction of this phototheodolite is Fic..96 such that the optical axis of the camera lens is always at right angles to the picture plane-the ground-glass surface or the sensitive film of the photographic plate. The intersection of the optic<tl axis and the picture plane, the principal point, is marked by the intersection P, fig. 97, of the two very fine platinum wires 0 0' and ff', one horizontal and the other vertical when the instrument is in adjustment. These wires are stretched across the back of the camera box as close as possible to the picture plane. The buttons b, figs. 94 and 95, serve to give tension to the wires. The wire O 0' corresponds to the horizon line and the vertical wire ff' corresponds to the principal line of the perspective represented by the image on the ground-glass plate. ·

Fig. 96 shows the rear view of this instrument, the ground glass having been replaced by an opaque plate, strengthened by a metal frame and ribs, which supports the Ramsden eyepiece in the center, its optical axis coinciding with that of the camera lens. The cross wires 0 0', ff', at the rear of the camera, serve also for the astronomical telescope into which the camera may be converted by attaching the opaque plate with central eyepiece as shown in fig. !l6. 'l'he fitting of this eyepiece allows for axial motion to adjust its position to avoid parallax. The rear opaque plate and the other sides of the camera uox are made of cardboard (impregnated with chemicals to render it impervious to moisture), and they are stiffened by frames and ribs of metal as illustrated in :figs. 94 and 96. The cylindrical part B, figs. 94, 95, and 97, is inclosed by a solid metal collar a, which is held in position within the metal ring l l' by four screws R, R', S, 8 1· This ring l l' is connected with the 0 frame g g' by meaus of two arms lg and l' g', all being cast into one piece. The frame g g' has pivots q attached to it which form the horizontal axis of rotation for the camera. This instrument is provided with a vertical circle, .fig. 94, horizontal circle H, figs. 94, 95, and 98, verniers, reading microscopes, levels L, :figs. 94 and FIG.97 96, clamps, and slowmotion screws, forming a complete transit with cen- 'n.Ji:5E~~lf" trally mounted "carnera~telescope." 0 p A Fig. 98 represents a vertical section of this instrument.

The horizontal circle has a diameter of 10·5 centimetres. It is graduated into thirty minutes, and its verniers read to single minutes. The photographic plates are 18 by 24 centimetres, the same size as for the 1884 model camera. The objective lens was an aplanat of Steinheil of F1C..S8 237·7 millimetres focal length. More recently, however, the Italian phototheodolites have been provided with anastigmats of Zeiss. The column E, figs. 94, 95, 96, and 98, forming a prolongation of the lower arm l' g', is held in place by two counter screws m and rn', fig. 96, which serve to hold the horizontal axis of rotation of the camera in a fixed position, avoi<ling accidental changes during tlfe execution of a set of panorama pictures. After unscrewing the nuts d', fig. 98, the tripod legs may be removed. They serve as "alpenstocks" when the instrument is being transported from station to station. The cameratelescope is lifted out of the wyes arnl packed in a separate case; the lower part of the instrument is packed in another case, and the plate holders aud plates are transported in a third case.

(2) Photogrammetric theodolite of Prof. S. Finsterwalder.-This phototheodolite (manufactured by Max Ott (A. Ott), of Kempten, in Bavaria) was devised by Dr. Finsterwalder after many years of practical work and experience incidental to his Alpine surveys and studies of glacial motion. This experience taught him the desirability of producing a camera compactly built, rigidly constructed in all its parts, and yet having a minimum of weight. To avoid the extra weight when transporting a separate theodolite (with thA surveying camera) for the trigonometric location of the stations occupied with the camera, he provided the surveying camera with the means for observing horizontal and vertical angles.

Professor Finsterwalder has used a double ana· stigmat of Gorz and later an anastigmat of Zeiss, with a constant focal length of !JO millimetres. With this focus the leus will photograph perspectively correct a plate of 160 by 200 millimetres. The plates have a size of 120 by 160 millimetres and they command an effective horizontal field of [>3°, enabling the observer to cover the complete panorama with seven plates. For the central or normal position of the objective the camera commands an effective vertical field of± 200. This range would often be insuflicient, particularly when photographing mountainous terrene of an alpine character, therefore it was deemed advisable to mount the objective on a slide, which will permit a consider· able cbauge in the vertical sense. Owing to this device, objects subtending an angle of depression of 35°, together with others subtending an angle _of elevation B of 5°, may still be photographed on the. same plate, giving a vertical control of 400 in all. h In extreme cases, when it should become desirable to photograph objects subtending angles of + 350 and of - 350, or 70° in all, Professor Finsterwalder recommends the exposure of two pla.tes in succession, commanding the same (identical) horizontal angle, exposing one with the maximum elevation of the objective slide and the other with the maximum depression of tl1e lens. Thus, inclined pictures are not only avoided, but the em~ctive surface of tl1e plate is utilized to the best advantage, and the weight of glass to be carried is reduced to the minimum. In order to obtain uniformly accurate results with the relatively short focal length (maintaining a constant distance between the lens and the sensitive surface of the plates), the plates are not inserted into plate holders (where the variable thickness of the glass would affect the so-called "constant focal length"), but they are pressed directly against a metal frame, which forms the back of the camera box, very similar to the arrangement described for Captain Deville's (Canadian) camera. To do this, use has been made of Dr. Neuhauss's leather plate holders, formed like a sack B, fig. 99. The inner edges of the metal frame are graduated in order to locate the principal and horizon lines upon tho negatives.

712

These leather sacks have metal slat arrangements, and the transfer of the plate from the sack to the camera is made by hooking the sack with its mouth to the upper edge of the rear camera side. While holding the bag in a vertical position the slats are opened and the plate is allowed · to slide from the sack m to the carrier to be exposed. Springs are provided at the back of the camera box to check against a sudden dropping of the plate into the metal carrier, to avoid a breaking or cracking of the plate by striking the closed lower metal slide of the plate carrier too hard. These springs also serve to press the plate, wh® in position for exposure in the carrier, into perfect contact with the graduated metal frame at the back of the camera box. By withdrawing the upper curved ha~dle, fig. 99, at the back of the camera, the tension of the springs may be reduced and the plate glides into position to be exposed. After exposure the lower slide is withdrawn and the plate will slip into the empty sack B, which had been hooked to the lower edge of the camera back for this purpose, as illustrated in fig. 99. The eccentricity of the center of gravity, by applying the weight of the sack and plate to one .side of the camera, does not affect the adjustments of the instrument sufficiently to throw the photographic plate out of the vertical plane in which the exposure should be made. This camera theodolite is accurately balanced when no sack is attached, in which form it is used to measure the angles that may be needed to locate the camera station (geographically, and aiso in the vertical sense) with reference to surrounding trigonometric signals. In order to convert this camera into a theodolite (with centrally located telescope), the back of the camera is provided with a telescopic eyepiece E, of a magnifying power of from 7 to 8. This eyepiece is adjusted to form a surveying telescope with the camera lens 0 as objective. It is provided with cross wires or webs, and a shutter affords the means to shut out the light when the instrument is used for photographing. The camera lens (objective of "camera telescope") being movable in the vertical sense within a range of 100 millimetres, all objects falling within a range of :I: 17° may be bisected with tbis telescope. The definition of points to be bisected, when above or below the camera h<:>rizon, would be very poor if the eyepiece E were rigidly fixed in the horizontal position, but by means of the metal arms NN the eyepiece may be revolved about a horizont9l axis in such a way that it will always be directed to the center of the camera lens. With the double anastigmat of Gorz, which produces a perfectly fl.at picture (with neither spherical, chromatic, nor astigmatic aberration or distortion), a change in the focus of the eyepiece will rarely be required. Horizontal angles may be observed directly by means of a horizontal circle of 120 millimetres diameter, which is provided with two verniers reading to single minutes. .A series of experimental tests has proven that horizontal angles observed between points of considerable difference in altitude may be obtained within a limit of error of 0·4'. This instrument, therefore, gives results 1mfficiently accurate to locate the camera station trigonometrically with reference to surrounding fixed points of known positions, if they are not too far distant to be defined with this low-power telescope. Vertical angles, however, can not be obtained dire'ctly. Still, by means of a scale and vernier attached to the camera-lens slide (or front boartl) the cl1ange of the camera lens from its central or normal position (that is, a value directly proportional to the tangent o'f the vertical angle) may be read to 0·05 millimetre. The slide motion of the front board is accomplished with a rack and pinion, and experience has proven that the observations may be obtained within a limit of error (converted into arc measure) of 1 minute. The three rods, designated by h in fig. 99, are each 100 millimetres long. They serve to . elevate the instrument support and the three leveling screws S sufficiently high above the tripod to allow full play for the leather plate holders B, when they are placed in position to rec~ive the exposed plate, The tripod legs may be folded together to one-half their length. No ground-glass plate being provided, a special finder has been devised correctly showing the field controlled by the plate for any position of the camera lens.

German Empire, and the following description has been taken from Zeitschrift fiir Instrumentenkunde, page 55, 18!)5: In the construction of this instrument, figs. 100 and 101, it has been sought to satisfy the following requirements: First. The camera should be sufficiently large to produce clear and well-defined perspectives. Second. The genei:al disposition of weight and mass should be symmetrical (the camera and the telescope of the theodolite were to be mounted centrally). Third. The weight of the instrument should be reduced to the minimum consistent with rigidity and sufficient strength to assure a free and easy manipulation, as well as durability or permanency of its adjustments when used in the field. This instrument is composed of two distinct parts, the camera proper (with horizontal circle) and a complete transit. They may be used separately and independently, but always upon the same support and with the same tripod. The interchange

between camera and transit is readily accomplished (both being centered over the same instrument support) with accuracy and expediency. The principal advantages attached to this disposition of the component parts of the phototheodolite may be cited as follows: First. The symmetrical and central mounting of the camera and transit telescope insures accuracy in the results. Second. The weight of each separate instrument-camera and transit-has been reduced to a minimum. Third. A disturbance of the adjustments of the instrument support (inuluding tripod) may be completely avoided by having the plate inserted and the slide withdrawn before placing the camera box into position upon the upper alidade limb. The carrying into effect of the ideas just mentioned has been greatly aide(l by supplying all

leveling and clamp screws with spherical ends resting upon plates in such a manner that a free play of motion will take place. These spherical terminations of the screws were originally devised by Reichel. The two forms in which this instrument may be used are shown in figs. 100 and 101. The former shows the photo-topographic camera (silmlar to Professor Finsterwalder's iustrument), and the latter shows the transit with compass B. IJ is the very rigid, yet essentially light, instrument support, the three arms being cast into one piece with the bearing for the couical pivot attached to the horizontal limb T. Tis the lower graduated limb and A is the upper limb of the alidade bearing the verniers. A large circular level is attached to the center of the upper limb of the alidade. The latter has three hardened plates inserted into its upper surface (at S, figs.100 and 101), one with a plane surface, the second with a conical cavity, and the third with av-shaped groove or slot. They form the supports for the spherical terminations of the three screws K, fig. 100, attached to either the transit or the surveying camera. These screws are received between the flanges C that form a. part of the base ring supporting either thE: camera or the telescope wyes H, fig.101. The two sets of three screws K (one for camera and one set for the transit) serve to adjust the horizon lines of both instruments and to bring them into the same horizontal plane. The transit telescope is arranged for stadia reading (after Porro's method), with 100 as the constant factor. The telescope level reads to 20", and the final adjustment of the transit is accomplished by means of this level. The striding compass B, fig. 101, is graduated to read to 30', whereas the horizontal circle reads either to 10" or 20", according to the size of the instrument. In order to secure the transit and the camera to the horizontal circle (which both have in common) three horseshoe-shaped clasps (shown near 0, figs. 100 and 101) are hinged to the upper limb A of the alidade in such a way that they straddle either set of the three screws K of the ·projecting flanges C (when they are turned up as shown in tbe figs. 100 and 101). Each of these clasps has a clamp screw with lever handle E, fig. 101, and by tightening these three clamp screws they are brought to bear upon the hardened beads of the screws K, making a firm connection between the upper limb of the alidade and the superimposed transit or camera. This connection is easily made, and it does not distnrb the adjustments of the instrument. This instrument is made in two sizes; one has plates 13 by 18 centimetres, and the other 18 by 24 centimetres. To avoid changes in the dimensions of the camera box, due to, hygroscopic influences of the atmosphere, the box is construeted entirely of aluminium. The plate holders and the movable plate carrier, however, are made of mahogany, impregnated with chemicals to make the wood impervious against moisture. To avoid any possible change in the constant focal length, due to an uneven thickness of photographic plates or of the plate holders, the movable carrier may be moved toward the camera lens by means of the levers L, fig. 100, until the sensitive surface of the photographic plate is brought into conta~t with a metal frame, securely fastened to the sides of the camera box, and which bas a centimetre graduation filed into its inner edges. The distance of the rear surface of the graduated frame from the second nodal point of the camera lens constitutes the constant focal length of the camera. The centimetre graduation on the inner edges of the metal frame, reproduced on the niargin of the negatives, serves to ascertain whether the sensitive films (or the contact prints) have undergone any change during the process of development and also to ascertain the amount of correction to be applied to the perspective, if found to be distorted, before using it for the iconometric platting. The camera is provided with a pair of cross levels to enable the observer to detect any change in its adjustments prior to exposing a plate. These levels are graduated to read to 20" of arc. When the instrument is in perfect adjustment, the picture plane will be in a vertical plane and the principal ray will be in the same horizontal plane as the optical axis of the telescope '(when level), if the camera were replaced by the transit without disturbing the tripod's position. When this camera theodolite is adjusted, the vernier M, fig. 100, will read zero for the normal position of the lens. Still, the obje1~tive may be elevated or depressed by 35 millimetres, whicll change from the normal or central position of the lens may be read correctly within 0.1 millimetre

on the scale and vernier M, fig.100. The pneumatic camera slmtter is arranged both for time and for instantaneous exposures, a special device guarding against the possibility of exposing a plate before it is brought into perfect contact with the graduated metal frame, previously mentioned. The plate holder can not be withdrawn from the camera before the slide has beeu replaced, nor as long as the plate is in contact with. the grad uatecl frame. (4) The phototheodolite of D1·. G. Koppe.-Dr. C. Koppe, professor at the Technical High School in Braunscl.Iweig, Germany, is an ardent advocate of pl.10togrammetry and he has done much toward popularizing photographic surveyiug in Germany. His work on photogrammetry, published in 1889, is an excellent manual both in respect to theory and practice. In 18!)6_ he published a treatise on photogrammetry applied to cloud photography for meteorological research. This phototheodolite, fig. 102, has a centrally mounted camera with the telescope on one side and the vertical circle on the other. The horizontal axi~ between the two wyes has been widened into a conical ring R, into which the camera a may be inserted. Four stout springs/ press the camera C tightly against the ring surface forming the base of the conical ring R. After insertion into the ring, the camera G is revolved within the former until the end of the screw b abuts against the stop d, when the horizon line of the perspective (negative) should be horizontal. The camera axis is parallel with the optical axis of the telescope T, both axes being in the same horizontal plane when the vernier of the vertical circJe reads zero. When elevating or depressing the telescope T the camera axis will follow the . same motion, both remaining parallel. The instrument will be in equilibrium with the cams era de- or attached. The horizontal axis of this instrument may be adjusted by means of the striding level L, which, when necessary, may be replaced by a striding compass I in a manner similar to that I illustrated in fig. 101. I Since the telescope may be I: I reyersed in the wyes, an error. I of collimation and any index error of the vertical circle may be found or eliminated. There are neither slides nor pJate holders provided with this instrument, the plates being· inse: ted directly into the camera. This may be done in the field by aid of the packing case Rpecially constructed to serve as a dark chamber, fig. 103. This case is made of wood with double doors, each door having a circular hole A, wbich is filled in with a flexible, Iigbt-tight, and dark-colored material, forming sleeves in such a way that the hands of the operator may be thrust through an elastic opening in the center (of the

circuJar openings). The fabric wiJl close tightly around the wrists-when the interior of the case will be perfectly dark-and the sleeves A will permit free play to the hands for manipulating the camera and plates within the space L of the case. This case is inclosed with a tight-fitting sole-leather covering, having two flaps S to protect the openings A against the admission of dust when the packing case is transported on the back of the instrument bearer. The entire instrument, except the tripod, may be packed into this case for transportatiou. It also contains two boxes,][, and K 2 ; the former receives the exposed plates (negatives) while the latter contains the supply of unexposed plates. When a plate is to be exchanged the camera 0 is placed into the packing case and both doors as well as the leather main flap or cover are securely closed; both hands are now inserted through A, and after the sleeves are .tightly closed about the wrists the camera is opened, the exposed plate removed and placed into the box K, (as shown at P, fig. 103). The door Tis closed and a new plate, taken from the box K 2 , is placed into the camera (as shown by g, fig. 103) and_ the camera back is closed, when the camera wi11 be ready for another exposure. The constant focal length of this camera is represented by the distance between the second nodal point of the lens and the rear surface of a metal frame (similar to that of Ney's phototheodolite) permanently attached to the rear of the camera box. '.l'he inner edges of this metal diaphragm or frame are graduated into centimetres; the middle graduation marks of the hurir.ontal sides of the frame locate the principal line, while the middle graduation marks of the vertical sides represent the termini of the horizontal line on the perspectives. The focal length, once determined, will remain unchanged forall plates. This instrument has been manufactured for Professor Koppe by F. Randhagen, in Hanover, Germany. The "Topographic Bureau" of the Swiss Republic has used a phototheodolite constructed after the model of Dr. Koppe's instrument. The experience in Switzerland, however, seems to have decided the topographic bureau not to replace the plane table by the phototheodolite for general topographic surveys executed by that bureau. (5) Phototheodolite devised by TT. Pollaclc, manufactured by R. Lechner in Vienna, Austria.-With this instrument (fig. 104) the camera 0 is centrally located, and it rests upon a horizontal circle. The telescope F and the vertical circle are mounted at one side of the camera, a weight G counterbalancing both on the other side of the camera. Aluminum has been used very freely in the construction of this phototheodolite in order to reduce the weight as low as possible. This instrument has been manufactured in two sizes; the horizontal circle of the small-sized one is graduated to 30', the verniers reading 1', while the larger one bas a circle graduated to 20', and its verniers read ~O". The telescope Fis mounted similarly to that of the so-called Danish plane table alidade. The adjustment of the horizontal axi~ of revolution of the telescope F is accomplished by means of a special level. Clamps and slow-motion screws are provided for both the horizoutal and vertical circles. The telescope has a focal length of 27 centimetre~ and an opening of 31 millimetres, with a magnifying power of 9 to 18 diameters. The telescope is arranged for stadia reading, and it has 100 as the constant multiplier. The telescope level L is graduated to 10" or 20". The vertical circle is graduated to 20' and its two verniers read to 20". · The camera box is made of aluminum and it is provided with a Zeiss anastigmat. By means of the rack and pinion z the lens may be elevated or depressecl by either 30 or 50 millimetres, according to the size of the instrument. The scale t, with vernier n, serves to measure the vertical deviation of the lens from its normal position. Also this camera is provided with a graduated metal frame, the inner edges of which have either a centimetre or five-millimetre graduation, which is reproduced upon the margins of the negatives. They serve not only to locate the horizon

and the principal lines upon the perspectives, but they also give the means io discover any distortion that may arise in the pictures due to the wet process of development. This metal graduated frame is brought into contact with the sensitive surface of the film by a si.mple mechanical contrivance in such a way that the focal length for all negatives is constant, even if the plate holders or glass plates should not be equally thick. (6) Ool. A. J,aussedat's latest phototheodolite.-This instrument (figs. 105 and 106) has been manufactured by E . .Ducretet and L. Lejeune, in Paris, France, Both transit telescope .L and camera 0 are centrally mounted, the latter above the former. The camera may also be used alone, independently of the transit, and it may tllen be mounted upon the tripod (fig. 106) by means of a special pivot or spindle S'.

Several loaded magazines, each containing 15 plates, may be carried with this instrument and the plates may be exchanged in full daylight without having to remove the camera. The photographic plates are u2 by 9 centimetres, but enlarged prints are used for tbe iconometric platting. Six plates cover the entire horizon and will form a complete panorama. The lens is provided with an 0 iris shutter. It may be focused for short distances or infinity by turning a lever over a scale showing the distances in metres attached to the front board, H, of the camera. In ftg.106 the camera is represented with the magazine, B, removed and replaced by the ground glass plate, G. The entire outfit, excepting the tripod, may be transported in one carrying case (with shoulder or pack straps) of 39 by 28 by 17 centimetres size and 8 kilogrammes weight if but one magazine filled with 10 plates is included. (7) The phototheodolite of Starke and Kammerer.-This instrument, fig. 107, is somewhat similar in construction to Profe~sor Finsterwalder's phototheodolite; both have neither telescope nor vertical circle, being provided with camera telescopes instead. An ordinary skeleton tripod supports the three leveling screws, S, and a central clamp screw with spiral spring, P, securely connects the tripod bead with the instrument proper. H represents the horizontal circle, graduated to 20', but by means of two verniers a.nd microscopes, L, horizontal angles may be read to 1'. · The vertical axis of revolution, ending in three horizontal arms, B 17 B 2, B 3, may be adjusted with the aid of the leveling screws S and the croRs levels l17 z.i.

The camera may be securely united with the vertical axis of the horizontal circle by a clamp screw manipulated from witllin the camera l.lox. When tho zero mark of the vernier n coincides with the 70 mark of the scale 111, tlle lens should be in its central or normal position. The slide S may be moved 70 millimetres up or down; from 70 to 140 it falls above the normal position. The lens is a Zeiss anastigmat, 1/ 13 , with a focal length of about 212 millimetres. ·when the camera lens is suitable for photo-topographic purposes, the horizontal change in the distance between its second nodal point and the image plane shquld only be: 0·09 0· 11 0· 15 0·2'.! 0·-15 millimetre for: distances of 500 400 300 200 100 metres. Hence focusing may be dispensed with for general photo-topographic purposes; still, in order that this instrument-for special purposes-may also produce sharp and well-defined pictures of objects close to the camera, the lens mount is such to allow a motion in th~ direction of the optical

axis within a range of 2 millimetres, whereby objects but 23 metres away from the camera may still be brought into focus. The external tube of the lens mount has a helical groove or slot, fig. 108, in which a small metal block t, provided with an index mark, may glide freely. This block is attached to the inner tube of the lens mount, and a screw rat one end of the slot serves to clamp the two tubes together, when the focal length will be maintained constant for any length of time. When the screw r is loosened and the outer tube revolved from left to right, the focal length will be shortened. When the block t has passed from one end of the slot to the other, the focal length will have suffered a change of 2 millimetres. The two positions of the index mark ou the block t, for these extreme limits, are marked on the edge of the slot on the outer tube, 0 and 2, fig. 108; the interval being divided into twenty equal parts, oue part will correspond with au axial motion of the camera lens of O·l rnillimetrn. A metal frame is attached to the back of the camera box, its rear surface coinciding with the picture plane. The inner edges of this frame are provided with a centimetre graduation; the middle marks (triangular file cuts) of the vertical sides of tllis frame designate the termini of the horizon line on the negative, while the middle notches of the two horizontal sides indicate the position of the principal line. When the instrument is in adjustment, the principal line will be

vertical, the horizon line will be horizontal, and their point of intersection will be the principal point of the photographic perspective. The opening of this metal frame is 17·8 by 22·8 centimetres, which is also the effective size of the pictures. The two frames I and II in figs. 109 and 110 give the means at band to make a light-tight connection between the single plate holders (or ground-glass plate) and the camera telescope. The short bellows w, connecting frame I with II, will admit the frame II to be moved a little while I remains fixed to the camera box. Each of these two frames is provided with two hooks, frame I having one upper hook h1, figs. 107 and 108, and a similar hook near the lower corner diagonally opposite h 1· The hook hi, fig. 108, is attached to the upper corner (opposite hook h 1) of frame II, which also has a similar lower hook diagonally opposite hi and directly under h 1· Fig. no represents a partial section of the rear end of the camera, showing:. the ground-glass attachment V. Frame II is fastened to frame I by means of the upper left hook lti and the lower right hook. ·The ground-glass frame Vis supported by the screws z, and z2 , figs. 110 and 111, the points of which rest upon the metal plates 7t, z. figs. 108 and no, attached to the permanently fixed frame I. The face of the ground glass G, fig. no, is brought into contact with the rear surface of the graduated metal frame R, fig. no, by means of the upper right and R lower left hooks. The ground-glass w p attachment V also has the eyepiece, which F1G. 10~ F1G.llO forms a telescope with the camera lens, converting the camera into a camera telescope. The position of the optical axis of the eyepiece may be adjusted vertically by turning the screws z 1 and z2 until the line of collimation of eyepiece and camera lens fall together into the plane of the camera horizon (the camera lens being in its ~o normal position, or the zero mark of the vernier n coinciding with the 70 mark of the scale m, fig.107). In this position.points on the horizon maybe sighted through the eyepiece of the ground-glass attachment; but when the camera lens had been moved up or down some distance away from its normal position the eyepiece can no longer be used with its optical axis horizontal, and the stops p 1 and pz, fig. 111, are now unfastened and the eyepiece is tilted up or down (rotating it about the horizontal axis x 1 x 2 , fig. 111) until its optical axis is directed to the center of the object glass, when the F1G. Ill image of th11 point to be bisected will appear well defined. The circular openings p, shown in the ground-glass attachment, fig. 111, serve to examine the middle notches of the inner edges of the sides of the graduated metal frame R, which define the horizon, and the principal lines of the perspective, thus giving the means to test the positions of those lines and to adjust the same, if necessary. The outer wooden frame V, fig. no, of the ground-glass attachment is strengthened with two metal diagonal ribs D 1, fig. ni, which are joined at their intersection by a ring r, the latter forming the support for the eyepiece, which may be revolved about the horizontal axis x, xz,, as !Jas been already mentioned. Each holder contains a single plate, and fig. 109 illustrates a section through the upper rear part of the camera uox with a plate holder Kin position: P =dry plate; it rests at its four corners upon the springs f.

We will now describe how the plate holder is attached to the camera for exposing a plate: Frame II is set free from frame I, and J( is hung to the frame II by means of the bent plate l, 'fig. 109, when the beveled projecting edge of K closes into the rebate of frame I I, producing a lighttight connection. J( is now secured to frame I I by the upper left and lower right hooks (which is the position shown in fig. 109). The hard.rubber slide Sis now withdrawn, and the pair of hooksupper right and lower left-are tightened to draw the holder K forward until the sensitive film surface is brought into contact with the graduated metal frame R at the back of the camera C, the springs f taking up any .lost motion and insuring a perfect contact. The lens is now uncapped, the exposure made, and the plate holder is withdrawn by repeating the same operations in the inverse order: unfastening the pair of hooks-upper right and lower leftinserting the slide S, and drawing back the last two hooks-lower right and upper left. (8) Captain Hiibl's plane-table photogrammeter.-This instrument is made by R.

The horizon and the principal line may be located upon the perspectives by means of the centimetre graduations on the inner edges of the meta.I frame vv, or two fine wireR may be attached to the corresponding points of the graduation.

The plane-table M, with alidade K, serves to locate the camera station in both the vertical and horizontal sense. If the camera stations are not very close together, the plane-table may also serve for the location of tertiary points and for the sketching of details. This photographic plane-table is well suited for topographic reconnaissance surveys. The results obtained by means of the same may not be as precise as those obtained with the more complicated aud refined phototheodolites, but it is more easily tram1ported, is very simple in manipulation, and the adjustments are not liable to be easily disturbed. The instrument is compact, well conceived, and excellently executed. The size of the photographic plate is 12 by 16 centimetres, giving an effective picture within the graduated margin of 10 by 14 centimetres. The cube-shaped camera has sides of 21 centimetres length, and weighs 3·5 kilograms. 'l'he packing case, including the entire outfit and stout tripod (three folding legs), weighs only 11·5 kilograms. The cost in Vienna of the complete instrument is 400 florins.
V. PANORAMIO CAMERAS,

The lenses of the older surveying cameras gave correct perspectives only for small angles, rarely exceeding 300, and Martens, in Paris, was probably the first to devise a so-called panoramic camera to photograph larger sections of the horizon on one plate, even with lenses that ordinarily would cover but a small angular field. If the objects to be photographed are far enough distant to permit the use of a constant focal length of lens for the picture, and if the lens may be rotated about a vertical axis passing through the second nodal point of the lens system, such panoramic views may be obtained upon a sensitized surface bent into a half cylinder whose radius equals the constant focal length of' the lens and whose axis coincides with the vertical axis of rotation of the camera lens. The topographic cylindrograph of R. Moessard.-The following-described apparatus bas been devised by R. Moessard (commandant du Genie, attach6 au service geographique de l'armee), of St. Cyr, France. The hemicylindrical camera box, fig. 114, rests upon a tripod, with three leveling screws to adjust the verticality of the axis of' revolution aa of the camera lens O, which axis coincides with that of the half cylinder formed by the sensitized surface of the film. The latter may be replaced by a half-cylindrical ground-glass plate. The camera lens 0 may be rotated by hand about aa, using the sight ruler Sas lever. By viewing the landscape throtlgh the sights PP' of the lever S, the proper timing for the exposure

of the different panorama sections may be estimated. The space between the lens 0 and the frame RR is tilled in with a light-tight fabric, allowing full play for the rotating objective 0. The upper surface of the topographic cylindrograph is provided with an azimuth compass 0 and a pair of cross levels A and B. The beut frame forming the guide for the sensitive film has graduations on the inner edges, which form the margins of each panoramic view. The divisions of the upper and lower (i10rizontal) scales correspond to degrees in arc, while the divisionK of the vertical sides are graduateu to read

{ , where f =constant focal length of 10 the lens 0 = radius of the cylindrical
sensitive surface of the film. Four movable indices are provided, two, H and H', fig. 115, serve to mark the horizon line of the half panorama, and the other two, N and E, indicate the magnetic north-and-south line and the magnetic east-and-west line for each half panorama, the compass O, with the sight ruler S, giving the means for propel'ly setting the index marks N and E for ~ch view. Thus the magnetic azimuths of horizontal directions may be taken directly from the pictures. The vertical angles are readily I I It. found by means of the ordi11ates of pictured point._. (above or below the horizou line HH') measured in oneh undred tbs of the focal length f, using the photographed scales on the vertical margins of the pictures for this purpose.

or when aa', measured on the side scale, is found to be equal to 25 divisional parts: .·tan f3= aa' = U.25 100 To determine whether the levels A and B, fig. 114, read zero when the cylindrical film is vertical, and also to ascertain whether the index marks JI and H', fig. 115, representing the horizon line, are correctly placed, we may proceed as follows: A theodolite, fig. llG, is set up about 10 or 15 metres behind the cylindrograph (after the back of the camera had been removed to bring the index marks Hand H' into view), and both instruments are leveled. After bisecting the upper edge of the cylindrograph the telescope of the theodolite is moved in azimuth, when the bisection should continue. 'l'he same should be the case for the lower surface edge of the cyliudrograph after depressing the telescope of the theodolite to bisect that edge. Does this not take place, the cylindrograph will have to be adjusted by means of the leveling screws until the bisecCYl.,INOROGRAPH tion takes place, when the level A is to be changed to read zero for this position of the cyli11drograph. The theodolite is now set up in the direction of the level A, at one side of the cylindrograph, and the level B is adjusted in the same manner as jnst indicated for A. ''I To adjust the i11dices 11 and H' into the horizontal plane (conI I I taining the optical axis of the adjusted cyliudrograph) a comparison I '\ I may be made on a cylindrograpJ~ picture, showing several poillts of I I known elevatious, the elevation of the cylindrograph being also I '\ known, or the theodolite may be set up with the horizontal telescope I I at .the same elevation with the ontical axis of the adjusted cylindroI I graph.

The conception of this instrument, however, is ingenious, and where the question of transportation need not be considered the topographic cylindrograph in a more perfected form may give good results for surveying purpmies.

ICONOMETERS AND PERSPECTOGRAPHS.

We understand under iconometers a series of instruments that have been devised to simplify the constructions of phototopographic platting (iconometry). After two drawing boards have been covered with paper (gummed down on the edges) uoth sheets are provided with a chart pr~jection upon which all trigonometric (triangulation) points are platted and their elevations inscribed. The constructions incidental to the iconometric platting of the phototopographic survey may be divided into three classes: First. The platting of all horizontal directions, that had ueen observed instrumentally, for the location of the camera stations and for the orientation of the panorama views. . Secon<l. The determination of the horizontal projection of points pictured on three or more photographs taken from different stations. Third. The determination of the elevations of the various camera stations and tertiary points (that are located iconometrically) to faeilitate the platting of the horizontal coutours of the terrene. The principal instruments used for the iconometric platting of the phototopographic survey in Italy have been described in Appendix No. 3 of the L United States Coast aud Geodetic Survey Heport for 1893. They are: I. The graphic proF1G.117 tractor. - It is used for platting horizontal direetally in the field on the platting sheet in the office. tions ollservell iustrumen ("settore grafico").-'fhis instrument, devised by Paga. II. '/'he !Jraphic isector zontal directions to points pictured 011 the photographs nini, serves to plat 110ri without first drawing the picture traces on thA working sheet. III. The graphic hyp someter. - This instrument has also been invented by Paganini. It serves to determiue the elevations of all points (camera stations, from the photographs) platted on the working sheet by as well as points platted the intersections of liues of directiou. IV. The centrolincad.-Reforeuce has been made to this instrument under the description of the Canadian photograph board. Captain Deville uses this instrument for drawing lines to a vanishing point falling outside of the limits of the platting sheet. The distauce between the principal point and the vanishing poi11ts of lines increases the nearer parallel to the pieture plane such lines are. Lines parallel with the pieture plane have their vanishing point at infinite distance from the principal point; practically they have no vanishing point. 'l'heir perspeetive"s are parallel with the original lines. It often occurs in iconometric platting that tl1e vanishing points of some lines fall outside of the limits of the drawing board, and, in order to draw a line which, if produced, would pass through the distant vamslliug point, special constructions would have to be made to locate the direction of sueh a line. This instrument, fig. 117, is used instead of making such auxiliary constructions on the photograph board. It is composed of a wooden stmightedge, L, and two wooden movable arms,

land l', which may be given any inclination against the straightedge L. The clamp screws, r and l' perrnanen tly in any position. The photograph board, fig. 70, is provided with four points, A, B, O, and E, indicatfng the centers of the studs against which tlie arms l and l' play or rest when the centrolinead is used on the photograph board. The distance between the studs may vary, but each two forming a pair are generally placed from 6 to 8 inches apart, and, the arms of the centrolinead being held in contact with tlle studs, tlle various directions of the ruler L will intersect each other in one common point. With reference to fig. 118 we have: A and B =one pair of studs permanently fixed upon tlle photograph board. OA and OB = movable arms of the ceutrolinead, now clamped in the position given them in the figure. 00 = ruler of the centrolinead (=Lin fig. 117). . If we describe a circle through the three points A, O, and B-the angle AOB remaining constant-the angle AOB will be an angle of the periphery AB for any position given the ruler 00 ( = L, fig. 117) as long as OA and OB (land l', fig. 117) remain in contact with the studs A and B. When 00 is changed to assume the position 0 1 C1 the intersection, V, of the two lines 00 and 0'0' will also be on the periphery of the circle because the angle AO V (A 0' V) remains the same and must subtend the same arc _,,1 Vas long as the studs A and B remain unchanged. lle11ce, for the assumed position of the studs the directions of all lines drawn along the .fiducial edge of the ruler 00 (giving 0 all positions on the arc A OB) will pass through the point V-they will vanish at V. In the iconometric work of the Canadian surveys the centrolinead is used only for drawing the perspecH' tives of horizontal lines, their vanishing points being on the horizon line. The studs A and B are placed on the photograph board on a line AB, perC pendicular to the horizon line and at equal distances from the latter. The F1G. llS horizon line Hll' (D.D' in fig. 70) becomes a diameter of the circle A OB V, and VA =VB. If the movable arms of the centrolinead include the same angles with the direction of the fiducial edge of the straightedge, the line 00, bisecting the angle AOB, must pass through IT midway between A and B. The distance of the vanishing point, V, from the principal point, P, may be varied at pleasure by changing the inclination of the arms, l and l', against the direction of the fiducial edge of the ruler L. When the direction of the arms l and l' falls together and is perpendicular to L, the vanishing point will fall at infinite distance from the principal point I' and the lines drawn along the fiducial edge of the straightedge L will become parallel with the horizon line HR'. The distance of the vanishing point V from P may also be varied by changing the distance between the studs A and B or 0 and JiJ, fig 70-increasing this distance will enlarge the circle AOB Y and V moves farther off from I', reducing that distance will decrease the diameter of the circle A OB V and V will approach the principal point P. The practice in Canada, however, is to retain the position of the studs unchanged on the photograph board and to change the inclination of the arms land l' of the centrolinead instead. If we gradually close the arms land l', Vwill approach the line AB and when the angle AOB becomes equal to 900 the arc AOB will have become a semicircle, and the intersection of AH with HH1 will be the center of the circle AOBV, the distance of both 0 and Vfrom AB will be equal

With reference to fig. 119 we have: P =principal point on the photograph board. A and B =positions of the studs. Sv =given direction of the line on the ground plan, when V will be the vanishing point for that line. We revolve the picture plane about the horizon line, as axis, iut-0 the horizontal platting plane when the station may fall in S, fig. 119, SP being then the distance Jine or focal length projected into horizontal plan. Should the point Y fall upon the drawing board we could describe a circle through AB and V and place the fiducial edge of the cen trolincad's straightedge upon DI' (upon the horiwn line) with the axis of rotation 0 of the arms p H l and l' in D upon the circle, then bring the arms l and l' into contact with t.he studs A and B aud clamp them in this position. Still, in this case FIG.119 there would bo no use for the centrolinead, the point 5 M V being accessible. To set the arms for an inaccessible point Y we again refer to fig·. 119. .Toin the poi11ts V uncl B, the angle YDB-the inclination of the lower arm l' agaim;t the ruler L-is equal to VBA, both angles subtending equal arcs of the same circle. Draw the lines CS and BS. At any point c 011 CB draw cJf anll c1· parallel to .AB and DP and join band v. By reason of similarity·of triangles, vb must be parallel to VB and the angle vbc = VBG = BDV.

Hence, the arms of the centrolinead may be set in the case under consideration by placing the ruler L on .llfb, the axis of rotation, 0, coinciding with b, and adjusting the lower arm l' of the centrolinead to coincide with bv. The other arm I, having the same inclinati011 against the ruler L as the arm l', may ho set by placing the ruler L upon the horizon Iino JJP and moving it along this line until the lower adjusted arm l' comes A into contact with the stud B, then moving the other arm l about 0 until it comes into ' I I ' contact with the stud .A and clamping it also. The lines BS, GS, life, and cv are drawn H H' once for all upon the photograph board, fig. 70. The only line to be drawn for setting the arms of the centrolinead is S1·, which is the F 1 G .. r20 direction of the given line on the ground B M plan. The line bv need not be drawn, the . points b and v being· located by drawing· cv parallel with the horizon line and c1lf or cb parallel with the distance line Sl'. (2) To set the arms of the centrolinetid, if the given lfae VE belong.<; to the perspective: Take any point F, .fig. 120, on the horizon line, join F with E and F with B, then draw c]lf parallel to AB.

Owing to the similarity of tri· angles i 1b will be parallel with VB and the angle vbc = VBA, which is the inclination of the arm against the ruler L of the centrolinead. FB and cM are permanently drawn 011 the photograph board, but FE and ve will have to be drawn for every given line. In this case two lines will have to be drawn instead of one, as in the preceding case.

Centrolineads are usually sold in pairs; one serves to work on the left side of the principal point and the other on the right side. V. The perspectometer (as used by Capt. E. Deville).-The perspectometer is used to dispense with the construction of the squares on the perspective when applying the "method of squares" (Chapter I, Paragraph IX) to draw a figure in the ground plan by means of its perspective. On a thin, transparent film (glass, xylonite, isinglass, horn, etc.,) two parallel lines AB and DD', fig. 121, are drawn intersecting the common perpendicular pP. Make DP=PD'=PA=pB= distance line (focal length) and fromp lay off on AB (to both sides ofp) equal distances:

pm=mn=no . .

=pm'=m'n'=n'o'= . . . .

Join these points of division to P and draw lines through the corresponding intersections of the radials from P with the perpendiculars AD and BD 1, rr', tt' . · . which lines will be parallel with AB and DD'. The w;e of the perspectometer,-The perspectometer is placed upon a perspective with Pon t11e principal point and DD' coinciding with the horizon line. The ground line of the peL"spective may fall in XY, fig. 121, it will be divided into equal parts by the radials from P, and the trape· zoids of the perspectometer o p represent the perspectives of the squares in the ground plane having the equal parts ou X Y as sides. By placing the perspectometer on the perspective in the manner indicated above the squares covering the perspective of the figure that is to be platted iconometrically on the ground plan are at once apparent, and only those re'I quired for the drawing of the figure in question are drawn FIG.1"2.J on the ground plan. The sides of the squares to be drawn on the ground plan (their side lengths are equal to the divisions on the ground line between the radials drawn from P) are laid off from tlie trace of the principal plane on the ground line, and the position of the front Jine nearest the picture trace (or ground line) is laid off on the ground plan either by estimation or construction. The estimation of the position of this line (corresponding to tt') on the ground plan is made by noting tlie fraction of a square's side which represents the distance (between tt' and XY, fig. 121) from the ground line on the persvective. The same perspectometer serves only for perspectives which have the same distance line (like photographs of distant objects taken with the same lens), diflerent distance lines requiring different perspectometers. The width p P should be equal to the heigllt of the horizon line above the foot of the picture; the radials from P need not exten1l beyond the width of the picture, the distance points D and D' having been taken as the limit of the perspectometer in the figure ( 121) merely to show more fully the principles involved in its construction. The length of a single division on the line AB should be selected with reference tp the resulting equal division lengths of the lowest ground line used for the pictures, as the dimensions of the division lengths on the latter give the measure for the sides of the squares to be drawn on the ground plan. These division lengths on the ground line should be in harmony with the scale of the plan and with the degree of accuracy that may be required for the delineation of the topographic features. The smaller the size of the squares is selected on the ground plan the more accurately the transfer of the figure from its perspective to the ground plan may be made, the same principles being involved in this method of iconometric platting as in the well-known method of reducing drawings by means of two sets of (hair) squares, the ratio of their sides corresponding to the scale of the required reduction.

Captain Deville recommends the perspootometer to be made by first drawing it on paper in a fairly large scale, and then making a negative of it, reduced photographically to the desired size of the finished perspectometer. A positive copy may now be made on a transparency plate, which, if bleached in a solution of bichloride of mercury, will show white lines on clear glass. For the sake of better preservation such perspectometer, when completely dry and hard, should be varnished. When using the perspectometer for transferring figures from their perspectives to the ground plan, when sach figures are situated in planes perpendicular to the picture plane but inclined against the horizon plane, the center of the perspectometer is placed upon the principal point P of the picture plane, the same as before, but the perspectometer is now revolved about P until the parallel lines of the same are parallel with the trace of the inclined (figure's) plane on the picture plane. In this case the trapezoids of the perspectometer represent the perspective of a net of squares situated in the inclined plane, the squares of which are now to be projected into the ground plane. This net of squarei:; in the inclined plane, when projected into the ground plane, will be composed of rectangular figures of equal size, their long sides being in a direction at right angles to the picture trace (or ground line) and of a length equal to that which is intercepted between two adjoining radials of the perspectometer on the trace of the inclined plane (on the picture plane), while the short sides of those rectangles (forming the projection in the ground plan of the squares in the inclined figure's plane) will be equal to the lengths obtained on the ground line by projecting the points of intersection of the radials of the perspectometer with the inclined plane's trace on the picture plaue upon the ground line of the picture plane. The construction of the rectangular net on the grouud plan may now be made in an analogous manner to that mentioned for the sqriarei;, and the drnwing· in of the figure 011 the ground plan with reference to its position within the trapezoids of the perspectometer is accomplished in the usual manner. Should the figures be situated in planes that are iuclined to both the picture and the ground planes, then the figure is first projected upon a plane perpeudicular to the picture plane, and having the same trace in the latter as the inclined plane. YI. 'l'he penpectograph.-Numerous instruments have been devised for drawing perspectives from plans or from nature, mechanically, or by means of optical devices, some of which may inversely become of use for transcribing perspectives of figures into orthogonal projections. The perspectograph, invented by H. Ritter, serves to construct the orthogonal projection of a plane figure from its perspective, or to draw the perspective from the plans of the object witliout referring to the o~ject itself. Ritter's instrument, manufactured by C. Schrmder & Co., in Frankfort-on-the-Main, has been patented in Germany, October 13, 1883, under No. 29002. It was devised primarily for architectural purposes. This instrument in its present form, composed largely of wood, is not well suited for surveying purposes, as it contains too many sources of error due to lost motion in its bearings, still, its theory being sound, there is 110 reason to question its ultimate value, even for precise work, if it were carefully made by an expert mechanician (excludi11g the use of wood and using metal throughout), being guided in its construction by the demands of the g1·eatest precision attainable. As a carefully constructed instrument based on the present pattern may become useful in platting the data of a topographic reconnaissance where, in the nature of the work, rapidity in making the results practically available is of greater importance than a high degree of accuracy, the following description of this instrument may not be out of place here. For its methods of use in phototopographic surveying we respectfully refer to Capt. E. Deville's work on "Photographic Surveying" already mentioned. We have seen (Chapter I) that the platted position of a point in the ground pla11 may be found from its perspective (in verti<1al plane) by locating· the point of intersection of the horizoutal projection of the ray: "station-pictured poiut" with the line of direction itself. (The latter with its vertical plane is revolved about the trace of the vertical plane in the ground plane (as axis of rotation) into the ground plane in which plane the point of iutersection is located.)

XY =ground line of the picture plane (vertical) llfN . .ill= platted position of the point JI[ in the ground plane GG. If we draw through the foot of the station s a line parallel to the ground line XY, and make its lengths (S), equal to sS, join (S) and the platted point M, then it will follow from the similarity of the triangles OµM and sSM that: sS: Oµ =Ms: MO From the similar triangles

The center of s is placed directly upon the point that marks the platted camera. statio1i on the ground plan. The ruler RT is placed parallel to the ground line of the picture plane, ands and RT are now secured in this position on the ground plan. When the arm sM is moved, s being held in a fixed position (to coincide with the platted station point), the point 0 will follow the motions of the arm sM, also applying its motion directly to the arm OD (which slides in the groove of XY) and indirectly to the arms of the pantograph system. The fourth sliding piece(µ), being connected with the joint A of the pantograph system by means of a separate piece, insures a permanently fixed distance between (µ) and A while the instrument is in use. The pantograph system is composed of six pieces: Four straight arms, AB, AO, Fµ, and F1-l' and two double arms or levers, ODE and BDG, which are bent at right angles at their points of junction D. The sides of the two parallelograms ABOD and DGFE are all of equal lengths, and the six arms are joined in A, B, O, D, E, F, and G. The arms Fµ and Fµ' are twice as long as the length of the side of the parallelograms. The pencil which describes the perspective may be attached to the free end of either arm Fµ or FJ.''· The angles GDB and EDO being each equal to 90°, the sum of the two other angles ODB

and GDE must be equal to 180°, and as the sum of two adjacent angles in a parallelogram is equal to 1soo, it follows that CDB + GDE = GDB +DOA or: GDE=DOA This shows that the two parallelograms JPGDE and GDBA must be equiangular, and as their sides are equal iu length, the parallelograms themselves must be equal, and the diagonals FD and GE of the one are equal to BO and AD of thfl other, respectively. The two long arms F1-t' and Fµ being of equal lengths, µµ'will be parallel to GE, both will be perpendicular to the direction of XY, and µµ'will pass through }), We have, th~refore, Dµ' =Dµ= GE=DA. Use of the perspectograph.-The sliding pieces is secured to the 'vorking board, over the platted position of the camera station on the ground plan, still permitting a gliding movement of the arm sM in the direction sM (fig. 124). The center line of RT is brought into a position parallel to the platted ground line, and its position is also secured to the board. The sliding piece (S), finally, is moved from.~ (in the groove of RT) until s (S) is equal to the elevation of the station S above the ground plane, also securing (S) in this position, when it will still permit a gliding movement of the arm (S) "1{ in the direction of ( S) Af. The center line of the wooden ruler XY is placed upon the ground line (picture trace) on the ground plan. The manipulation of the instrument and its general working will now readily be understood.

For instance, when the tracer Mis moved in a direction parallel to R1' or to XY, the arm 8ffl will move the slide OD in the same direction. The distance 0 (µ)remaining unc11anged-as long ass ( S) undergoes no change-(µ) A will also remain of a, constant length. Hence, AD and also GE, as well as D µ, undergo no changes, and the pencil in µ or in fl' will trace a line parallel to XY, representing the perspective of a line of the ground plan (the one traced by M) parallel to the picture plane. Wheu Jlf is moved in the direction of sM, away from XY, the positions of 0 and D remain tho same, but Oµ /(a,) will be lengthened, (µ) moves to the right, or away from I O, carrying the point A with it (A (µ) being a constant I I length) and increasing the length of tlie diagonal .DA in I I proportion to the increase of the length of 0 (µ). DA being equal to GE= Dµ (Dµ'), the latter will also be lengthened, aud µ will be moved down, or away from XY, by the same amount as (µ) is moved to the right. The relation between the construction made in fig. 123 and the mechanical platting by means of the perspectograph will now be evident. VII. Professor Hauok's trilcolograph.-This instruF1GllS ment has been described by Dr. G. Hauck in a memorial commemorating the opening of the new building of the Royal Te()hnical High School at Charlottenburg, near Berlin, November 2, 1884. It serves to reconstruct an object from two perspectives of the same that had been obtained from two different points of view. . The principles which underlie tho construction of this instrument hold equally good for the construction of an instrument to be used for the mechanical platting of the ground plan of any object represented on two photographs obtained from different stations. In 1887, Prof. F. Schiffner already suggested the changes to be made to Dr. llauck's instrument, in order to render it available as an instrument of precision for tho use of the phototopographer; still it seems that mechanical difficulties in its manufacture are yet to be overcome, as the writer bas not met with any record of such a perfected instrument having been either in use or even been constructed. In Chapter I it bad been shown that a point, A, photographed from two stations 8 and 8 1, may be platted in horizontal plan, if the two picture traces, gg and U1U1, and the two camera stations, S and 8 1, are given on the horizontal plau, fig. 125. The two picture planes may be F"ic;.126 revolved about their ground lines, gg and U1U 1, into the ground or platting plane, when (a) and (a 1) will be the two images of the point, A, revolved into the ground plane. If we draw lines through (a) aud (ai) perpendicular to the corresponding ground lines gg and g 1g1, then a' and a1' will be the (horizontal) projections of the picture a1 ' will locate points, a and a1, into the platting plane, and the intersection, A' ,of the radials Sa' an<l S 1 the positions on the vlatting sheet of the point A, pictured on the two plates as a and a 1, respectively. This graphic determination of the platted position A' of the point A may be accomplished mechanically by placing slotted rulers with their center lines upon gg and g 1gi, :fig. 126~ and indicating the directions of the perpendiculars, dropped from the pictured points (revolved into the horizontal plan) upon the ground lines, by two arms (a) he and a'b of a pantograph combination, where (a)b =be = a'b or

The points (a)a' and c will always be situated on the periphery of a semicircle described about b as the center, and, as the points c and a' are permanently held on the line gg, the angle (a.) a'c (angle of the periphery subtending the semicircle) will be equal to 90° for all inclinations that may be given (a)c against gg. The directions of the radials Sa' are laid down mechanically by means of two slotted rulers Sa' and S 1a'h held in position by the studs in Sand a' (and 8 1 and a' 1, respectively), both rulers being revolvable about tho fixed points Sand S. This instrument, of which the characteristic features are illustrated in fig. 126, performs the constructions mechanically that were made graphieally or geometricalJy in fig. 125. The slotted rulers gg and g 1g 1 are secured to the platting board (their center lines on the picture traces) by means of thumb tacks T. The pantograph arms (a) c-(a 1)c 1 - and a'b-(a' 1 ) b1 are connected with these rulers by means of sliding joints c (and c1) and a' (and a 11), while the studs which mark the stations Sand S 1 end in cylindrical projections that fit into the slots of the rulers Sa' and S 1a 11, the latter fitting also over similar cylindrical attachments to a/ and a' 1, in such a way that the rulers Sa' and S 1a' 1 may freely ghde over the points Sand a' (or S 1 and a' 1) and at the same time may revolve about the fixed points Sand 8 1, respectively. 'l'he points (a) and (a 1) are provided with tracers, and a pencil slide is attached to the intersection of the rulers Sa' and S 1a' 1 (in A') in such a way that the pencil point may freely slide either way in the grooves of Sa' and S 1a11· A comparison between the figures Nos. 126 and 127 will plainly show that A' will always represent the platted position of the point A, derived from its two images a and (a1) (revolved into horizontal plan). Still, it may not always be possihle to identify both images of the same point on the two pictures, and, iu order to apply Professor Hauck's method to identify the second image (on the second photograph) by means of the so-called "kernelpoints," the instrument shown in fig. 126 should be modified in such a way that the point of the second tracer may always be upon the image (on the second picture) which corresponds to the point designated by the first tracer on the first picture (revolved into tlle ground plane). We had seen (Ohapter I) that the line connecting the image of any point A on the first picture with the image of the second camera station (with the kernelpoint (s 1), fig. 127)-and the line connecting the image of the same point A on the second picture with the image of the first camera station (with the kernelpoint (.~), fig. 127)-will bisect the same point o of the line of intersection of the two picture planes. The picture planes being vertical, this line of intersection will be represented by the vertical line through the point[), of the ground plane (through the point of intersection of the two picture traces or ground lines gg and g1 g1 ). The picture planes having been revolved about their ground lines as axes into the horizontal plane, this line of interaection, <J" D, also revolved into the ground plane (once about gg and once about g1g1 ) will appear twice in the platting plane, once as D( ff), perpendicular to gg in D, and again as D( <J"1), perpendicular to glg 1 in .a. As the points (ff) and ( o 1) represent the same point <J" revolved into the horizontal plane, once about gg and again about g1g1 as axes, the lengths (<J")D and (ff1)D must be equal. In order, therefore, that this instrument, fig. 126, may work in harmony with the principles that underlie Professor Hauck's method, it will have to be modified to fulfill the following conditions: A line drawn through the kernelpoint sh fig.127, and any point pictured on the first photograph and a line drawn through the kernelpoint sand Uie image of the same poiut on the second photograph are to intersect the line of intersection of both picture planes in the same point <J", or the two lines revolved (with tbe picture planes) into the horizontal plane must bisect the revolved lines ( <J") [), and ( <J"1) .a (of the line of intersection of the picture planes) in points (tr) and ( tr1 ), both to be equidistant from D. The complete instrument, in a general way, is represented in fig. 127. The two slotted rulers (Jg and U1U1 of fig. 126 have been supplied with additional arms D( o) and .Q( ff 1), each arm including an angle of 900 with its ruler. These rectangular elbow pieces are secured to the platting board by four thumb tacks .T after the rulers 9D and gill had beeu placed with their center lines upon the picture traces gg and g 1g 1, respectively, in such a way that the intersections of the center lines of the elbow rulers (at the rectangular elbow ends of the rulers) coincide with the intersection .a of the b'Tound lines or picture traces gg and g1U1·

The pantograph arms, representing the ground lines of the pictures, are attached to the rulers the same as shown in fig. 126. Studs are inserted into the kernelpoints (81) and (8), and the arms 11( <1) and 11( <11) support a ruler ( <1)( <11), which may glide freely over these arms of the elbow pieces. To cut off equal lengths by this ruler (<1)(<11) on the elbow arms 11(<1) and 11(<11), the angle d(<T)e is adjustable, and it should be regulated for each set of two picture traces to make:
( <1)11 = ( <11)11

When ( <1)d is moved along the slot of ( <1) 11 tbe slide point ( <1 1) will move along ( <11) 11, 11( <1) always being equal to 11 (<Ti). The screw d serves to clamp tbe angle d( o-)c for. any opening corresponding to the angle

Slotted rulers are now placed over the studs that mark the kernelpoints (81) and (8), their slots also receiving the cylindrical prolongations of the tracers (a) and (a1) and those of the slide points (<1) and (<11), respectively. To complete the instrument, two slotted rulers RS and R 1S 1 are finally placed over the studs S and 8 1 (marking the platted positions of the two stations) and over the sliding joints a' and a' (which are the same as those in fig. 126). At their point of intersection .A' the sliding pencil point is inserted (into the slots of these two rulers), which finally completes this instrument as illustrated in fig. 1~7. If we now move the tracer (a} on the first photograph, the pantograph arms (a) o and ba' will change the position of the ruler SR (into the direction of the radial from S, to the horizontal projection, on tbe picture trace, of the pictured point designated by the tracer point (a) on the first photograph), and the ruler (a) (8 1) is moved, locating the point ( <1).

This change in the position of ( <r) produces a corresponding change in the sliding point ( <Y1), which in turn changes the position of the tracer (a1), causiug the pantograph arms (ai) Ci and b1a' 1 to move, and a change in the position of a' 1 will cause the radial ruler R 1S1 to assume a new position also. The intersection of RS with the new position of R 1S1 will locate the platted position in horizontal plan of the point under the tracer (a) on the first photograph, without having actua11y identified the corresponding image of the (same) point under the tracer (a1 ) on the second picture. If a line on either photograph is followed out by one of the tracers (a) or ( a 1), the pencil point A.' will draw the horizontal projection of the line given in perspective (the second tracer being observed chiefly as a check or to aid the general working of the instrument by a gentle tapping when the movements of the various parts of the instrument are retarded by too much friction or lost motion). Until now no perfect perspectograph has been constructed, and, no matter how accurately such instruments, like the one just described, may be made by the mechanician, there will always remain some unavoidable imperfections in the material or in the workmanship of the instrument that will produce more or less error in the results. For accurate and precise work, therefore, the iconometric platting should be accomplished with the aid of graphic or geometrical constructions for all the control work of the survey, using perspective instruments only for filling in such details which, in an instrumental survey of a similar character, would be sketched in by the topographer.
