W ashin(!ton, July 1, 19ft9.

The honorable the SECRETARY OF CoMMERCE. . DEAR 1b. SECI!E1'ARY: There ·is transmitted herewith my first .annual report, This report is for th~ fiscal ~~a:r ~:nded JuM so, 1929, and is the ninety-eighth an.nuaJ report of th1s bureau. · ·

INTltODUCTION
. With the ending of the p11st ·fiscal year the Coast and Geodetic S~rvey completed the thirteenth year of its second, century: o:f active ex1~tence. :Cn most respects the results of the ye,ar have been· v~ry sat1sftictory; The demands upon the bureau for the rnany 6.nd varied services that it renders-demands thst have increased to a notable ·e;xtent ~uring recent yea~-:-eontinued ·.·without abatement. . As a l'esult of a constant effort to m~:re\\s~ our outru.t by th.e development of
more econoJJ?-ic11l metho.ds tmd more efficie:nt equipment, real progress hne of intef11ill inipro\'enients was made. The res~lts ·clbtamed by the .use of several new and remarkable methods and mstruments, de8cribed in the 1928 annual report <lt the bureau, have fll11y justified our es'timate of their value. · · Especially· ~atif:ving .has be~n the evidence ac~lllilulitted through the yea:r not only of th~ m~reasmg use by thi: pubhc i:>i t~e numeroµs
'alon~ the

products of the bureau but also of the spreading rea.llza.tion, even on the part of those who receive only indirect benefits, of the value arid essential nature of the services that we furnish. , The importance of our charts and other nautfoal publications, being an indispensable part of the navigator's equipment, naturally has oeen recognized from the first. The value to engineers and scientists o:f the results o:f other operations, such as the bureau's geodetic work snd its tide, current, magnetic, and seismologic in.%stigations, has not been so well known. To bring these products, and the many ways in which they may be used to advantage, to the attention of the general public, and thereb;y to inc!'ease the return on its investment in this particular branch of our Government) has boon the object of a determined campaign for a number of years. Our e.fforts along this line are producing definite and excellent results. Certain present unsatisfa~tory conditions relative to compensation of personnel, both on the active and retired lists, which, of

course, do not affect this bureau alone, have been mentioned in previous reports. While there has been no mat~rial improvement during the past year, there have been a number of indications that the urgent need for relief in this respect is well recognized. I am hopeful that the present situation will be remedied by more liberal legislation in the near future. From another point of view the record of the year is less favorable for it has brought home with increasing force the realization that this. organization, due to insufficient personnel and operating facilities, is unable in all respects to provide the complete and adequate service that is essential to navigators, engineers, and others. It is a congenial and easy task, in a report of this nature, to recite the accomplishments in which we may perhaps take justifiable pride. To mention our deficiencies, even though they result from causes beyond our control, is not so pleasant. I would, however, feel guilty of a serious neglect of duty if I :failed to bring to your attention the condition of the bureau in this respect. The Coast and Geodetic Survey is charged by law with a number of specific duties. Some of our products are vital to the safety of our Navy and merchant marine and have a very distinct bearing on the economical aspects o{ water transportation. Others have a definite dollars and cents value to the engineering and allied professions. If our resources are insufficient to enable us fully to meet the needs of those whom we serve, the result is a direct economic loss that must continue until relief is obtained. In this report I shall1 therefore, endeavor to set forth as clearly and concisely as possible, not only the progress of the bureau in performing its duties but also the extent to which it has failed to meet its ooligations, the reasons therefor, and the steps that appear necessary in orper to remedy present conditions. Before taking up these mattel'.s however, I can not refrain from mentioning the grievous loss suffered by the bureau in the death, on April 9, 1929, of Col. E. Lester Jones, director of ,the bureau since 1915. In his death the members of this organization feel that our country has lost an outstanding executive and that they, personally, ·have been deprived of a capable and trusted leader whose faith m this service and devotion to its ideals afforded a constant source of inspiration.

Part !.-FUNCTIONS OF THE BUREAU; ITS PROGRESS AND' NEEDS
PRIMARY FUNCTIONS OF THE <BUREAU

In order to carry on its work efficiently and .economically the organizatlon of the Coast and Geodetic Survey consists of a number of divisions, each charged with the accomplishment of one or. more classes of work. The duties of these divisions are in many respects so different in character that it is necessary, in order to prepare a comprehensive report, to consider each .almost as a separate entity and to treat of its progress under a separate heading. The thol,lght has occurred to me that this arrangement, although seemingly nee~ essary, may have a tendency to create the impression that this branch /of the Government, while performing several important duties, is engaged in a nllm.ber ,of unrelated operati9ns and rn'\lst in the very nature of things be unbusinesslike and cumbersome. , · To correct any impression of this nature tha:t may exist1 I b_elieve that it is desirable to begin this report with a brief outlme' of the organization of the bureau with the idea of defining its primary functions and of indicating the relation between the different ' branches of its work. The Coast and Geodetic Survey was organized 113. years ago for the purpose of surve;}'ing the coast and harbors of the United States.I including adjacent shoals. From a small beginning the scope .ot its operations has grown with our co~ntry until it rl?w oper9:tes throughout the vast extent of the Umted States and its off"lymg Territories. , . . The results of our coastal surveys are published, for the guidance of navigation and the protection of life and property at sea, on about 700 different charts which constitute the basic product of the .bureau. I take it :for granted that there is no need to paint out or emphasize the importance of coastal charts to any nation that dep~nds on water transportation for any part of its prosperity. The greater pait of the information sh'own on these charts is obtained by extensive hydro<Yraphic and topographic Sl,lrveys and the accuracy and adequacy of such surveys in any region are, therefore, an index of the condition of the charts of that region. · The first surveys of any navigable waters for purposes of chart construction are d.esigned 'to meet immediate needs and such. future requirements as can be anticipated. In many cases however, survey.s that. had these qualities are found, after a. periqd of years, to be entire~y madequate for the new ~eeds that have developed during that time. There are also extensive stretches of our coasts where charts may become inaccurate on account of changes in the depths of navigable areas and in the. configuration of channels, due to naturn;l causes or improyements by man .. Such con?i~ions can ,~~ remedied only by repeatmg or. supplementmg the origmal ·sl1rveys,

REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE

There is also a considerable amount of information required by mariners that can not be shown conveniently on charts. This includes sailing directions and dafa. relative to port facilities, weather conditions, radio service, and similar subjects. To supply this information all maritime nations issue volumes called Pilots. The Coast and Geodetic Survey publishes 12 Pilot volumes for the coasts under the jurisdiction of the United States and 3 Inside Route Pilots for our inland waterway,;. Material for these Pilots is collected in connection with hydrographic surveying operations and by special parties. The geodetic work of the bureau has for it$ principal object the establishment of a great number of stations, distributed along our coasts and throughout the interior, which provide a foundation or framework for practiCally all charting and mapping operations. These are divided into two general classes-stations, the positions of which, with relation to each other and on the surface of the earth, are determined·; and bench marks, the elevations of which are known. lt has long been recognized that gflodetic control is absolutely essential to the satisfactory execution of extensive mapping projects and to the proper location of the boundaries of political subdivisions and 6f private property; also that the operations required to establish this control provide dat~ indispensable to certain lines of scientific investigation. During recent years there has been an increasing realization of the value of geodetic control in many engineering and industrial operations such as highway location, hydroelectric power development; drainage and irrigation projects, ·and flood control. As is the case with the majority of maps, a nautical chart, ei;;pecially if it extends over more than a very few miles of coast or is oneof a number of charts covering an extensive stretch of coast, must; be based on a rigid control system tb,at forms a backbone for the. ~ntire series.. ~t is consid~red that one of the outstan~ing indications of the ability of Ferdmand R. Hassler, first su:i;>ermtendent of this service, is that be recognized this fact and insisted on the performance of operations that would produce the results desireda procedure for which neither this bureau nor any other map-making organization has ever been able to find a satisfactory substitute. Just as the first coastal work of the bureau, back in 1816, began with a trigonometric survey to locate control points, so mus\ its pre~e~t-day hydr<;>graphic ~nd topograph~c opera~ions be P.receded by a snn1lar geodetic operat10n, called tnangulat10n. Without th1& control the bureau would be unable properly to plot a single sounding, landmark, or aid to navigation on any of its charts. When, as a result. of the growth of our country from a narrow band of States along the Atlantic coast, it became necessary to extend geodetic control inland, the work was not delegated in a haphazltrd manner to the first bureau that came to mind. It was assigned to an oi:ganization that from the first had been carrying on similar operations as ·a necessary part of its duty and was the only agency equipped with the trained personnel and suitable instruments required for the work. . The necessity for tidal observations as a part of any coastal survey . is fairly obvious. Charted. soundings must ~how the depths at some definite stage of the tide adopted as a uniform plane of ref-

COAST AND GEODETIC. SURVEY

erence. This being the case, the bureau's ti~al investigations se~ve two purposes with respect to chart production; first, they provide data: for the establishment of the- reference plane and :for the reduction of all -soundings to that plai;ie ; sec~md, they enable the .bureau to· compile annual tables of predicted,tides by means of which the mariner can time the movements o:f his ship to take advantage o:f the tide or, by using the tables in conjunction with his chart, can ascertain the actual depths at any time. This information is of great importance nowadays .when t:he drafts of a large number of ships are but little less, and are sometimes grea;ter, than the low-water depths of the channels which they must navigate. · . The_ degree of safety .and facility with which a shjp may be handled .in restricted waters and its running time between po~ts ~re often affected to a consiae·rable extent by tidal currents. With the inc~ease in size of ships and the growing importance of economy in their operation, it has been necessary in late years for the bureau grea~ly to extend the scope of its current investigations which .are carried on in connection. with tidal observations. · Outside the bu:eau the results of these operations are of great value in harborimprovement work, sewage disposal, and similar projects; . The magnetic surveys of the bureau are carried on for the primary purpose of _providing the ~ata relative to magp.etic va~iation that are shown on all charts and airway maps and are essential to the accu- · rate use of the mar~ner's compass. The results ar~ equally necessary for land surveymg and for many branches of scientific research. The activities mentioned above are all essential branches -of chart and map production work. That the results, once they are availa~e, are valuable and increasingly useful in many other lines of e:p.deavor is 'certainly a desirable condition but should not- be allowed to obscure .· · ihe fundamental purpose for which they are obtained. These operations are carried· on and supervised to a certain extent by separate· di visim:is of the bureau for the following reasons : Re" sults that come in from the field require a very considerable amount of office work to put them in final form for use; ·The expeditious accomplishment Of this work requires· the serv:ices of mathematicians, cartographers, and others who are specialists in the various branches of office work. The .operations themselves are generally of such a nature that in the field, if a certain- part of the work is done with extreme accuracy, the remainder may be accomplished by less precise Ir?-e~hods. The. fi~s.t class of work is b1l!3t ca~i~d on under the super;. v.1sio~ of the d1v1s1ons concerned,· but there is no further _specializa~ hon m field work. The field officers of the bureau are competent to perform all classes of work, and it is the usual procedure for each party to execute all field operations required for chart compilation. The bureau has recently engaged in two other activities. One of these is airway mapping. In addition to being directly in line with our other charting operations, the assignment of this duty to the bureau .is simply a case of utilizing trained personnel and a· modern map-making plant to turn out additional work with no great increase in overhead expenses. The necessity for this work is obvious. The other activity is seismology, or earthquake investigation. This was delegated to the bureau for the reason that the work required is aqmirably adapted, both in the field and office, for prosecut10n in

with our magnetic surveys and,. like airway mapping, can .be carried on with only a moderate increase in operating e,xpenses. We are not carrying on this work.alone, but rather are cooperating with a number of other agencies by obtaining certain fundamental .data required by all. The collective : results can not fail to. ha;ve beneficial effects with respect to public safety.
PROGRESS AND SUFFICIENCY OF SERVICE

conjun~ti9n

The various classes of operations are discussed below in order to picture in a general way the progress of the bureau in accomplishing .its duties, to point out the factors that have contributed to that progress, and to indicate the extent to which we are meeting the demand· for otfr' products. Details concerning- operations in the field and office are given in subsequent parts of this report. ·
HYDROGRAPHIC AND TOPOGRAPHIC WORK

~perations were carried on extensively along t11e coasts of the United States, in Alaska, and in the Hawaiian and Philippine Islands. The greater part of this work was on large projects that were adopted and started before the begi!lning of the year. · . . An important accomplishment on the Atlantic coast is the completion of surveys in the vicinity of Cape Canaveral, Fla., in con.nection with a general resurvey of the South Atlantic· coast in progress for a number .of years. This section, on account· of exposed ,location and: the .existence of several off-lying shoals, is one of the difficult parts. of the project. An interesting feature of work elsewhere on.the east coast iS the completion of a wire-drag examination of an area off Portsmouth, N. H., to be used for deep-submergence tests of submarines. To accomplish this survey it was necessary to set the drag to a depth over three times as great as has been used heretofore, . which required the development of special apparatus a.nd methods of operation. . The very satisfactory rate of progress of Pacific coast surveys that has been made possible during recent years by the use of modern ships equipped with echo-sounding instruments and apparatus for. radio-acoustic position finding, as described in the 1928 report of this bureau, was more than maintained. Each party surveyed a greater area than in any previous year. Over 75 per cent of tb.e Pacific coast of the United States has now been adequately . surveyed for present needs. . Operations in southwestern Alaskan waters were greatly facilitated by the use, for the first time in .Alaska, of the radio-acoustic method 'of position finding. As an example of the efficacy of this method may be cited the fact that one of our s~ips, workinP; off ?rince 'Yilliam Sound, was able to run over 700 miles of sounding Imes durmg one week ,of thick weather that would have entirely prevented work with methods previously available. Surveys in the Hawaiian and Philippine Islands were expedited by the use of echo-sounding instruments with which all ships ·operating in those waters are equipped.

Taken altogether the accomplishments in this branch of our work during the past year constitute a record, as far as this bureau is concerned, for quantity output of high-grade work. Research work for the purposes of developing new methods and appliances was carried on both in the field and office. Experiments were made with a new type of echo-sounding apparatus for use in shallow water and a new instrument was devised for increasing the accuracy of deep-water measurements by this method. All field officers stationed in "\Vashington were given a course of instruction in the use of echo-sounding and radio-acoustic apparatus. In connection with its Coast Pilot work the bureau compiled a new publication containing tables of distances between Uruted States ports. This volume lists over 400 ports and points on inland waterways and is intended to supplement the Coast Pilot series by providing a convenient means for ascertaining navi~able distances between the ports of the United States and its off-lymg Territories. Condition of surveys.-During the past decade steady progress has been made toward increasing the output of surveying parties and reducing the unit cost of work. This has been accomplished by the use of modern ships, improvements in methods and apparatus, and careful planning of work in order to reduce the cost of starting projects and to coordinate the efforts of the various parties,' · Since 1916, the last normal pre-war year, the area surveyed per year has more than doubled; unit costs have been cut nearly in half. These internal improvements have enabled the bureau to meet, to a considerable extent but not entirely, a very great increase in the demand for new charts and for additional information on existing · charts. Surveys on the Pacific coast, in general, are keeping pace with the need for charts and probably can be completed as rapidly as conditions require. A similar situation exists in southeastern Alaska. Conditions in western Alaska are not so satisfactory as the demand for surveys and new charts exceeds our ability. to provide them. It is believed, however, that the situation is not critical and can be cor.rected within a few years by a reasonable addition to the facilities that now exist or have been authorized. · In the Hawaiian Islands the bureau is nearly keeping up with the need for surveys. and should have the situation well in hand in the near future. A considerable amount of work remains to be done in the Philippine Archipelago, but the need is not urgent, as we are not-behind in supplying the demand for new charts. Porto Rico and the American Virgin Islands have been fully surveyed. It appears that no additional work in this region will be required for some time except for the purpose of charting any harbor improvements that may be made. . · As a general rule the nature of the coasts mentioned above is such that resurvE;Jys will not be required for many years. The exceptions are a number of rivers, bays, and entrance bars that form a very small percentage of the total area. · On the Atlantic and Gulf coasts the situation is entirely different; for here the bureau is far behind in meeting the need for new surveys and the adequate charts that result therefrom. ·

This vast extent of coast line has a. length of about 3,500 miles along its general trend and is so broken by bays, indentations, points, and off-lying islands that the actual shore line measures about 18,000 miles. Backing ·a large part of these coasts are important inland waterways navigated by thousands of small vessels and motor boats. Notwithstanding the fact that surveys ha l'e been made at one time or another along the entire extent of our eastern seaboard, not over one-third of this re~on is adequately surveyed at the present time. A large proportion of the. inland. waterways requires examinations that can not even be considered with present resources. There are two principal reasons for this condition; one is the great change that has taken place in the requirements of naviga· tion. Early surveys were made· to meet the needs of ·light-draft sailing vessels that worked their way leisurely into a small nuznber of ports. Nowadays there are scores .of important harbors to and into which swift, deep-draft steamers must proceed by the shor~t possible routes regardless of conditions of weather and visibility. This development has been responsible for a steadily increasing demand for surveys in greater detail and for the extension seaward of such surveys. . The other reason is the fact that by far ·the greater part of the eastern seaboard (practically all of the- coast south of New York) is subject to constant chti.nge, necessitating resurveys from time. to time in order to provide accurate charts. Additional, facilities 1'equired.-For many years the facilities of :this bureau. on the east coast·have been entirely inadequate to co{>e with the conditions outlined above. As a general rule, surveys m any one locality have been made at the expense of other regions where the need for work, while urgent, was not quite so acute.. We now have three ships for this work; all converted yachts obtained from the Navy when it disbanded its war-time auxiliary fleet. None of. these is entirely suitable for surveying operations and only one ~s fit for offshore work in exposed localities. A new shi.P now under construction will soon be available partially to relieve the situation, but there is urgent .need for two additional ships with personnel and operating funds; one for work on the outside coast .and the other for surveys of inland waterways. With a. fleet of this size the charts of the Atlantic and Gulf cqasts can, within a reasonable time, be brought up to the excellent standard that is being maintained elsewhere. Otherwise the pros· pects for any rapid improvement in present conditions are <l;iscouraging. ·
CHA.RT PR()DUCTION

· The· various office processes involved in chart production begin with a careful review and verification of .field sheets and records. The data obtained from these and from numerous other sources are next correlated and combined in the form of a chart drawing. A tabulation made a few .years ago listed· 469 field sheets and records of various kinds. that were used in the compilation of a single chart. The chart is then engraved on copper or on. glass negatives, transferred to a printing plate, and printed on a high-speed lithographic

OOAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

press. Finally each chart must be ·corrected by hand for changes that occur .between dates of printing and issue. During the past year over 1,000,000 hand coriiections were required. ·Ou!' chart-production force has several other duties, including \ preparation of the weekly Notice to Mariners in collaboration with the Bureau of Lighthouses, the custody of thousands of origina) survey sheets, and the preparation and issue of copies of these sheets , The latter activity is growing rapidly. . Because of their marked 1 accuracy in comparison with eontemporaneous surveys the earlier 1 sheets are frequently the only means of obtaining an authentic por- \ trayal of condition8 existing at certain times in the past and consequently have been found of great value in deciding property lines and in solving various engineering problems. During the past fiscal year the activities mentioned above have been carried on with increasing volume. A larger number of charts was distributed than in any other year since the war. Other accomplishments include an investigation relative to slope correctjons to echo soundings and the development of a mechanical method of transferring correction work to the printing plate that will result in a considerable savin~ of time. . .. · Airway mappirig.-lhe program airway. mapping and progress to the end of the fiscal year are shown on the diagram :facing page 41 of this report. This work is beginning to show a trait common to other. branches; of our operations-namely, that· we are confronted by a, constantly. growing demand so that our greatest possible progress falls far short of requirements. . . The original program contemplated only the prod:uction of strip maps of establ~shed airways. It now appears necessary to extend this to include sectional aeronau.tical maps of the United States. This necessity arises froJU the fact that about 80 per cent of .the present· annual flight mileage is away from the regular airways; Work is now in progress on the first of these sectional maps. Internal improvenwnts.-In order that the results of surveying operations may be published with the least possible delay it is important that the time required for chart construction be reduced to the greatest practicable extent. To accomplish this and to meet the need for e;xpansion, every effort has been made. in recent years to ~evelop .a smooth-~ork~ng and e~cient offic~ organiz!Ltion to handle this work. The various improvements that have been made are too technical and elaborate to be described here; their efficacy is shown oy the results attained. . . . . . Since 1916 our productive capacity has more than doubled; the average time to complete each new chart is now less than one-half qrnt required in 1920. In this connection a noteworthy record was made during the past year by our engraving section. In 1920 the average elapsed time requi.red to engrave a new chart on copper was over 27 months. During the fiscal year 1929, 12 new charts, more than in any recent previous year, were engraved in an· average elapsed time. of 4.9 months. The need for greatly increasing the issue of charts b,as been met by a complete transition from copperP.late printing.to offset lithograHhic printing. . , .· . Additional, p_ers~l reqidred.-:-It is obvious that there .is. a very close relation between the amount of chart-productfon. work that

l

of

10

REPORT TO THE - SECRETARY -OF COMMERCE

must be accomplished and· the volume of survey material coming in from the field. The present condition of the bureau in this respect is shown graphically on the opposite page. Special attention is invited to the disparity between the increase in surveys received and the increase in our chart force since 1916. A considerable part of this discrepancy has been made up by internal improvements as mentioned above but it is too large for complete compensation in this manner. As a result, unfinished work is, and has been for some years, piling up. This condition affects every branch of chart ·production. Surveys frequently must wait their turn for a longer period than is required to convert them into charts once they can be taken up! some projects must be postponed indefinitely; back orders of important charts, indicating the aifference between supply and demand, fluctuate but are always present to some extent. - 'Vith our present force the current program of airway mapping will require about 15 years for completion. The immediate needs of aerial navigation, and it is unthinkable that they will not increase ~eatly in the future, indicate that this program should be completed m one-quarter of the above time. The present situation can be remedied only by an increase in personnel. Seven additional employees are required in the airway mapping section. Throughout the other branches of our chart-pro.: duction force 14 additional employees are needed. Such an addition would provide a force 13 per cent greater than at presentl 54 per cent larger than in 1916, and capable of handling expeditiously a volume of incoming material over 100 per cent greater than in 1916. The need for additional personnel for chart-production work has been mentioned in the annual reports of this bureau for several years past; it grows more acute every year. It is believed that this need, on account of its urgency and moderation, deserves the most careful consideration.
CONTROL SURVEYS

In order properly to distribute control stations of known latitude and longitude throughout the United States, a number of belts or nrcs of triangulation must be extended across the country. Some of these run north and south, others east and west, and a few in an oblique direction, so that they cross each other and form a triangulation net covering the entire country. In a similar manner a network of level lines provides bench marks of known elevation. In addition to -serving the interior, these nets are necessary for the proper tying together of charts of the east and west coasts of the continental_ United States and of Alaskan waters; also for correlating these charts with maps of the interior. In providing a triangulation net it eventually becomes necessary to adjust it in a single unit in order that unavoidable discrepancies where two arcs join may be distributed over the entire system. This has been accomplished for the western half of the country. -During the past fiscal year the funds available for geodetic work were devoted largely to supplying missing arcs that are required for the. ~djustment of the net over the eastern United States.

the limits of our resources excellent ·progress was made in this work and several necessar;r arcs or parts thereof were completed. In ad~ dition, a triangulat10n arc in California, required for cooperative earthquake investigation, was about three-fourths completed. Other accomplishments include the completion of a·number of lines of firstorder leveling and the maintenance of· the variation of latitude !"tation at Ukiah, Calif. · · · Notable office operations were the completion of adjustment of the triangulation in the Hawaiian Islands and the isostatic reduction for 49 gravity stations at which observations were made during the cruise of the United States submarine S-41. 'The results were furnished to Doctor Meinesz, of the Dutch Geodetic Commission, under w~ose supervision the observations were made. An extensive investigation was 'also ·made £or the purpose of··adjusting the· combined level nets of tihe United States and Canada. .· : Increase in effioiency.-lnternitl progress in this branch of our work during recent years is fully comparable with our advance in other lines. Since 1916 annual mileage of triangulation has increased over 60 per cent; unit costs for this w.ork have been reduc~d to about 45 per cent of the 1916 figure. This increased efficiency has been made possible by 'stabilization of personnel, bettei· transportation: .facilities," and improvements in instruments, equipment, and methods. · Control. surveys shoUld be ewpedited.-Tfie situation in this country with regard to geodetic surveys .is not satisfa~tory. ?-'he hi~h q'!lalitJ of the work that has been done and the effici~ncy with which it has been executed are reco~nized throughout the civilized world. Unquestionably, however, it is not being carried on toward completion at the rate required to meet the need for the data it provides. Only 43 per cent of the area of the United States is covered by topographic maps and of this area probably not over one-half is accur'ately mapped because of obsolescence and the more exacting. requirements of the map user of to-day. Control surveys are the first step toward remedying this condition. · A growing realization on the part of the public that this work should be accelerated is evidenced by resolutions urging greater pro~· ress adopted by such representative engineering and scientific orgamzations a~ the A~erican Society of qivil Engineers and the Ameri~an Geophysical Umon; also by the testnnony of numerous State officials and private individuals. A pro!Iline~t citizen of on.e of our ~vest.er,n States, in a recent cominunicat10n, cites the followmg uses m his -State :for control surveys and for accurate miips based thereon: Geological investigations, compilation of rainfall and snowfall data vitally important to irrigation and power projects, study of forest conditions, soil surveys, highway development, and forest-fire c·ontrol. He deplores the lack of adequate control surveys in his State but is frank enough to admit that man1 other States ai·e facing the same situation. It is difficult to estimate the full value to engineering and industrial enterprises of maps based on accurate control. In highway construction 11lone, however, i~ is probable that the saving, due tc selection of the shortest practicable· routes, that would result from the availability of a standard to:pographic m1,1,p would be sufficient to pay the entire cost of completmg the map.

µij.qerstand, when we consider that a highway of the best type costs :from $30,000 tp $40,000 per mile while the cost of a topographic :rp.ap is not over $50 'per square mile . .. The requirements of th.is. country· for control surveys have been studied extensively by the yarious map-making qrganizations of. our Government. As a result it is generally agreed that the size of the meshes of the triangulation and level nets should be reduced to such an extent that no point in the United States will be more than 25 miles from a control station. With present resources the completion of this pro~ram will require from 40 to 50. years. Under existing conditions 1t is safe to say that in any 5-year period the economic waste due to lack of this control will exceed the total cost of the project.. · .

AND CURRENT SURVEYS

The tidal work of the bureau is well standardized. In general, it consists of the maintenance of a number of primary tide stations distributed along our coasts to which are referred observations obtained at numerous secondary stati.:ms. The· data obtained from all of. these are used for the compil';Ltion of tabies of predicted tides, published annually in. ad:vanc~ and for other 'purposes. · To meet a gradua~ increas.e in the. dema!ld for· tidll~ informati.on it is ne~essary, fyom time to time, to establish new primary stations. Durmg the past decade this increase has averaged about· one new station per the past fisc.al 2~ primary. s~ation~ were niaintai~ed. Several of these wer.e operated m cooperation with other orgamza~ions, this bureau ~ntributing the instruments required and receiving the records w1thout other expense. .Observations .from secondary stations included a large number of short-period observations obtained by the various field parties of the bureau and through the cooperation of other organizations. · Every tide .station is connect~d with several permanent bench markS at a known elevation with respect to such datum planes as mean low water and mean sea level. These marks are of great value to engineers for many purposes, including investigation of the permanence. of our coast li!le and 0£ improvements. alon~ .the coasts on which many millions pf d~llars ha~e been expended .. There have been so many requests for mformation regarding these marks that it has been considered desirabfa to publish the data in printed form.

The results of the.se surveys are published in tables 0£ predicted currents and in special publications relating to individual localities; 'l'he instant demand for this information is ample evidence of the desirability of extending the work. A recent pub.lication is a v?l.ume 0£ current charts for New York Harbor. From the best mformation available it was estimated that the first edition would last something over one year. It was sold out in three months. Additional, personnel reqwfred.-The present need for this class 0£ work in the field can be cared for with our present appropriations. Office work, however, is falling behind chiefly on account 0£ increased work incident to the extension of our current surveys. There· ii? need for two or three additional mathematicians in order that the results 0£ our field work may be handled without undue delay. The nature of tide abd current work, both in the field and office; is such that automatic or semiautomatic instruments can be used to a considerable extent and work can, therefore, be carried on at a very nominal cost. For this reason a small investment for additional personnel will yield large returns.
TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM AND SEISMOLOGY

During the .P.ast fiscal year the five magnetic obs~rvatories 0£ th~ bureau were contin,ued .in operation and observations were obtained at 96 stations in the field. The latter mclude several points in .th.e interior of Alaska never before reached for this purpose. . New methods which facilitate observations have been adopted at several observatories. Other operations include cooperative observations at Duke University, Durham, N. C., and special aurbral observations at Sitka, Alaska. , Some progress was made<in the office toward the publication of results of observations, but this work was limited to a considerable extent by insufficient personnel. Special attention was given to the maintenance of contact with the many organizations·throughout the world which are engaged in magnetic work. Cooperation with the Navy Department and the Carnegie Institution of Washington was especially satisfactory. . Seismological observations· were obtained at Tucson, Ariz., and Sitka, Alaska,· throughout the year and at San· Juan, P.R., up to the time of the September, 1928, hurricane which damaged the observatory buildings to a considerable extent. Cooperative stations were lilamtained at the tiniversities ~f qhicago and Hawaii. Noteworthy progress was made m the orgamzat10n of volunteer observers for the collection of reports on certain effects of earthquakes. A feature of the service that is provided in this class of work is the early determination of positions of earthquakes through reports from observatories and cooperative organizations. This information has been found so valuable that, at the request of Great Britain, it is now being transmitted to Europe as a part of the meteorological messages of the· Weather Bureau. · ·Additional, iequirements.-In order· properly to carry on both the magnetic and .the seismological work in the field a slight increase in observatory personnel, several small buildings, and ·a £ew improved

instruments are required. Our most urgent need, hqwever, is £or additional personnel in the office. Public service in these fields is measured almost entirely by the information available in published form. Through a determined effort and by neglecting a part of the work, basic needs have been met; that is, information has been supplied for chart and airway map production and data have been furnished to some extent for other purposes, such a.s investigation of radio transmission and search for oil and minerals. On the other hand, there have been serious failures of accomplishment. There is a demand for magnetic information in convenient form throughout the United States; this has been prepared for only about one-quarter of the country. Long delays in the publication of observatory results are especially serious but are un. avoidable. The quarterly seismological report, which is fundamental in all earthquake investigations, is several years in arrears. Our present office force is engaged in a desperate struggle with this accumulation of material . While the volume of accumulated material is large, the increase in personnel required to remedy the situation is extremely moderate. The services of only four additional scientists and one clerk will result in a great increase in efficiency and will enal?.le us to issue. a great amount of valuable information, the publication of which has been delayed for a period ·far too long.
INSTRUMENTS

Practically all of the operations of this bureau are of such a nature that the quantity and quality of the results attained depend to a considerable extent on the availability of adequate, and in many cases highly specialized, instrumental equipment. For this reason the instrument division of the bureau has always played an important part in its work. Durin¥ recent years this division has made a remarkable record in the aevelopment of new instruments and in improving those already in use. Many of these achievements have been mentioned in previous reports of the bureau. Among the accomplishments of the past fiscal year are the following : · 1. Development of a portable engine-driven sounding machine for use in hydrographic launches. A standard machine of this nature has been badly needed for some time and its use undoubtedly will further increase the efficiency of our inshore hydrographic work 2. Redesign of the depth-registering sheaves used with sounding machines for deep-sea sounding. The new sheave has a more rugged registering device which is easier to read and operate than the old register. 3. Desi~ and construction of a special dividing machine for level rods. With this machine rods can be graduated ·with a degree of accuracy much higher than was formerly possible. Experiments indicate that, with rods graduated in this manner, changes can be made in the details of first-order leveling operations that will speed up the work from 10 to 15 per cent.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

An adequate instrument division is ·essential to the work of this bureau for both practical and economic reasons. In the first place we often require special instruments in limited quantity, the development of which by J?rivate firms is exceedingly difficult .. In this respect our instrument division has an immense advantage through its close contact with our field force which provides an exact lmowledge of the purpose :for which the instrument is required, as well as the conditions under which it is to be used, and also affords unlimited opportunity for tests in the field until the apparatus is finally perfected~ Futhermore, the development by frivate firms of special instru~. ments for which the dem.and is smal is usually an extremely costly proposition. We have had extensive experience along this line. Our records show many cases where the bureau has obtained estimates for such work, found them so high as to be far beyond its resources, and h~s then constructed the instruments in its own shops. Actual costs from 50 to 100 per cent less than those estimated by private .firnis have been the general rule; savings much greater are not uncommon. In this and in previous reports has been mentioned. the great improvement in field work due to the development of radio acoustic ' position finding. After a bid of $4,000 for one unit of .this. apparatus had been received, it was constructed in our shops at a total cost of $449.98. . . ' .. 'Vhen a number of instruments are required and one has been perfected and is available as a model 1 procurement at reasonable prices from private fii'ms is usually practicable. Additional instru1rnent makers reqwi?·ed.-The operations of our instrument division, as is the case with the majority of our office divisions, are hampered by insufficient personnel. Another common characteristic is that the increase required is so small in comparison with its ultimate value, as indicated above, that an extensive ar~ ment in its favor hardly seems necessary. In order properly to mam~ain and r~pair our stock of instruments and to develo~ .a number of improved mstruments that are badly needed, five addit10nal instrument makers and mechanics are required.
CHANGE IN HEADQUARTERS OF THE BUREAU

The prospective use, for the construction of an office building for the Ho~se of Rep.resentatives, of the site formerly occupied by the Coast and Geodeti~ Survey at 205 New Jersey A venue SE., necessitated a change in the bureau's Washington headquarters during the pa~t f?.scal year. For this purpose, pending the completion of the new bmldu:~g .for the D.epartment of Commerce, the Pub.lie Buildings Commiss10n authorized the rental of the 7-story building at 119 D Street NE. The moving of the bureau was completed during the early part of June, 1929. Our work was necessarily retarded to a considerable extent, b:ut the ground lost is gradually bein~ i:egaine~. The hearty co?perat10n ~f the e1!1ploJ:ees of ~he bureau .m mcreasmg production prior t~ movmg, their assistan~e m the movmg operations, and their zeal.ous efforts toward resumpt10n of work, are worthy of the highest praise. ·

REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE

NlilEDS OF THE ·BUREAU

The remarkable industrial and commercial growth of thi!:. country since the World 'Var has been responsible :for a great increase in the demand for all of the various services rendered by this bureau. To meet such an increase only two methods are available; first, to secure a greater return on every dollar expended, by rigid econom:y and by intensive effort toward greater output through internal improvements; second, to .utilize additional facilities obtained by means of increased appropriations. . · . Application. of the first method to the fullest possible extent before resorting to the .second is dictated not only by the necessity :for ·national eGonomy but also by the first principles of good business management. . . The extent to which the bureau has used the first method has been recorded in the preceding paragraphs. The ~act that the results nieri.tioned have been obtained without assistance in the :form of larger appropriations may require a word of explanation .. It is true . that the approJ?riations for this· service are greater than they were a few years ago, m 1923, :for example. The increase, however, has been solely for the purpose of providing additional compensation :for employees in accordance with general legislation affecting large groups throughout the Government service of which our personnel is an exceedingly small .Part. Exduding this item, the funds provided :for the annual operatmg expenses of this bureau ha.ve decreased $55,000 sin<;e· 1923. . The foregoing ·statement also indicates the extent to which thci bureau 'is behind in its work and the increase in facilities required to remedy this sit.uation. There is little likelihood that the work in arrears can be made up through further increase in efficiency. Internal progress undoubtedly will continue but necessarily at a diminished rate not sufficient to keep up with a constantly growing demand. In this connection it should be borne in mind that a large part of our progress in recent years is due to radical improvements that practically have revolutionized methods and apparatus in use with only minor changes for a century or more. They are not an everyday occurrence. For several years this bureau has devoted unremitting effort toward the reorganization and modernization of its functions. The results have enabled it to meet a very large part of the additional demand for its products. I believe that the improvements of the last decade constitute a record in which any organization might take pride. At any rate it is one on which this bureau is willing to stand squarely in an appeal for the increase in facilities that is now required to enable us completely to accomplish our duties. I feel that our request for additional resources is especially reasonable in that a large· increase in appropriations is not required. A little help properly distributed throughout the various branches of our .work will enable us to catch up and keep abreast of our national pro~ess instead of struggling along and :falling constantly further behind. The largest item is the need for new ships on the Atlantic coast. This expenditure, however, would be distributed througl~

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

17

several years and the cost of the ships is small when spread through the years of their usefulness. . Undoubtedly our most imperative requirement is for additions to our office force to enable it to handle accumulated and incoming material. By all means Jet us put a roof on our· house before we build an addition. In so doing, however, it is my earnest hope that the urgent needs of the bureau along other lines will not be overlooked. Taken altogether, the additional facilities that we require are moderate. The cost will be small with relation to the total appropriations of the bureau; insignificant when compiired with the value of the results to a large part of our population.

Part II.-IN THE FmLD
HYDROGRAl'HIC AND TOPOGRAPHIC WORK

During the fiscal year 1929 hydrographic, topographic, and control surveys were made on various sections of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, along the Alaska coast, in the Hawaiian Islands, and in the Philippines. To J?erform these surveys, which comprised 38 separate projects, 25 different survey units were employed. A summary of the surveys accomplished or in progress at the close of the year is given below: Atlantic co.ast.-At the beginning of the fiscal year the suney ship Lydonia was engaged on a resurvey of the southern part of the coast of Maine. New surveys were carried northward from Portsmouth, N. H., to Portland, Me. A wire-drag party completed the sweeping of a trial course for deep submergency tests of submarines in the vicinity of Portsmouth, N. H. A resurvey of Gloucester Harbor and the Annisquam River, Mass., was completed. Revision suryeys were made at Newburyport and Hampton, Mass., and at Edgartown, Oak Bluffs, Gardiners Bay, and Jamaica Bay, N. Y. Revision of the Potomac River triangulation was completed. The ~urvey ships Ranger and Natoma made new surveys in the entrance of the Delaware River and in the vicinity of Five-Fathom Bank. An original survey of the Cooper River from Charleston, S. C., to the Seaboard Air Line bridge was completed. On the Florida coast topographic, hydrographic, and control surveys were carried southward from the vicinity of Ponce de Leon Inlet to Cape Canaveral by the party on the survey ship Dljdonia. The ships Ranger and Natorna completed similar surveys from Jupiter Inlet south.ward to Hillsboro Lighthouse, and in addition the party on the Natoma developed the shoals off Cape Canaveral. Control surveys for the reduction of air photographs were made along the Florida coast in connection with other operations. Examinat10ns were made by the party on the Ranqer of several reported shoals between Hillsboro Lighthouse and Miami, and revised the triangulation in a _portion of Biscayne Bay. On the west coast of Florida surveys of San Carlos Bay and the Caloosahatchee River were completed by the party on the survey shlp Hydrogm:plter. This party also completed the triangulation and traverse necessary to control the air photographs between San Carlos Bay and Cape Sable. A revision survey of Mobile, Ala., water front was made. Pacifi<J coast.-On the Washington coast a shore party had started control and topographic surveys preparatory to taking up hydro18

graphic work between Cape Elizabeth and Cape Flattery. Chart revision work was done in the vicinity 0£ Seattle. On the Oregon coast the survey ship Pioneer completed the project on which it had started during the latter part 0£ the previous fiscal year, namely, a complete topographic and hydrographic survey 0£ the coast :from Cape Foulweather to Cape Arago. This work extended . approximately 60 miles offshore. Inshore work was done by the launch party :from Cape Blanco southward to Cape Sebastian. On the Califorrna coast the survey ship ,Discoverer completed the project it had started during the latter part 0£ the previous fiscal year, r;amely, a complete topographic and hydrographic survey 0£ the coast :from Cape Sebastian· southward to Crescent City. The offshore hydrography was carried southward to Redding Rock and exten<led approximately 60 miles offshore. During the latter part 0£ the fiscal year this party started on a similar pro~ect which extended southward :from Cape Mendocino to Point lieyes. At the end 0£ the year the work had been carried to the vicinity 0£ Point Arena. A launch party engaged on inshore hydrogra.Phic and topographic surveys had completed work from Crescent City southward to Mussel Point. Near the end 0£ the fiscal year the survey vessel Pioneer started on a new project which extends from Point Reyes to Point Sur. Considerable revision work was done in San Francisco and vicinity. Alaslca.-In southwest Alaska the party on the survey ship Swrveyo-r completed a large offshore area southwest of Montague Island. This work extended offshore to Portlock Bank. Surveys were also made by this party in the approaches to Ressurrection Bay and in Harris and Two Arm Bays. A survey made in Sitkalidak Strait, Kodiak Island, by a subparty 0£ the Swrveyor disclosed a passage which shortens the steamer track 0£ vessels approaching Port Hobron :from the westward by approximately 40 miles. At the end of the fiscal year the party on the Su1'Ve'J/OT had taken up work .on the north and west coast of Kodiak Island and was engaged on surveys in Shelikof Strait and in Uganik, Uyak, Zachar, and Alitak Bays. While working at this project the party drarrged the area where the steamer Aleutia;n was wrecked and disproved' the existence 0£ an uncharted rock in that locality. H avJaiia;n I slands.-At the end of the fiscal year the survey ship Guide had practically completed the survey of the inlets, shoals, banks, and adjacent waters which extend westward :from Niihau Island to French Frigate Shoals. During the winter season this vessel ~·urveyed a large area west and northwest of the island of Hawaii and made detailed surveys of the landings at Honokaa and Kukuihaele on the north coast 0£ the island. A revision survey of Kahului Harbor .on the north coast of Maui Island was also made by this party. Pliilippines.-The survey ships Pathfindtrr, Fathomer, and Marinduque were employed. throughout the year on surveys in Balintang Channel,· Lyzon Strait; on the east coust of Luzon, in the vicinity of Casiguran Sound; in the Sulu Archipelago, in the vicinity of 1:awi Tawi Island; and on the south coast 0£ :J\:finda.nao, in the vicinity of Davao and Dumanquilis Bay.

· :For several years the funds available for geodetic work have been devoted largely to the extension of the first-ordei·· triangulation.net of the ,country.. This has been done with a view to supplying those missing arcs that are needed ·in the. adjustment of the net in order that. final or standard geographic positions· can be furnished those desiring the data. The time comes in the conduct of the geodetic work of a nation when the network of arcs of triangulation must be adjusted in a single unit and those unavoidable discrepancies where two arcs j_oin must be distri_buted over the net according to the best mathematical methods. This has already been accomplished for· the western half of this country. The eastern border of that net is,an arc of triangulation which extends from Canada to Mexico, approxiinately along the ninety-eighth meridian. During the fiscal years 1930 and 1931, even if no increase in appropriations for the·geodetic work is made, additional arcs for the eastern half of the country will be executed. ·

22

REPORT TO THE SEORETARY OF COMMERCE

Triangulation during the past fiscal year· has been extended from central Iowa along approximately the ninety-third meridian south to central Arkansas, with a spur line from that arc running eastward for 100 miles from Springfield, Mo. That arc of triangulation which extends from the vicinity of Martinsburg; W. Va., northward via Pittsburgh, Pa., to the Lake Survey triangulation in northeastern Ohio was completed. Part of that arc was executed in the previous fiscal year. An arc of triangulation was begun in the vicinity of Sandusky, Ohio, and carried southward to a point about 60 miles north of Portsmouth, Ohio, during the first half of the fiscal year. Lat.e in the fiscal year this work was resumed and it- is expected that it will be completed very early.in July, 1929. An arc of triangulation was begun in the summer of 1928 in Maine and was completed in June, 1929. The work had to be discontinued in the fall of 1928 because of unfavorable atmospheric conditions. An arc of triangulation for the study of earth movements in California was begun during the early part of the fiscal year in southern California. This arc will run between Newport Beach and Lucerne Valley. About three-fourths of that arc were completed during the fiscal year. The remainder will be executed in the early part of the fiscal year 1930. The location of the arc was decided on by officials of this bureau in consultation with members of the committee on seismology of the Carnegie Institution of 'Vashington. By executing arcs of triangulation over regions subject to earthquakes in the past, and the location of many triangulation stations which are well monumented, one is able by making new observations in the :future to determine whether the ground has undergone strain in horizontal direction and its extent. If an earthquake should occur in this region, the reobservation of the angles of triangles would enable one to determine the amount of movement at different places and to determine the distance from the actual fault resulting :from the earthquake that movement has occurred. This work, which is considered to be of prime importance for the study of earthquakes, is in its infancy, and it is believed that exact knowledge of the behavior of an earthquake may have a large influence on the practical affairs of our people. First-order levels were run between Republic, in western Missouri, along the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway to Memphis, Tenn. A line was run from Montrosi:.i_ Colo., to Farmington, N. Mex., and another from Tucumcari to Taylor Springs, N. Mex. Two lines of first-order leveling aggregating 230 miles were run in Kentucky. In Virginia levels were run from Covington to Richmond along the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad and from Glasgow Junction to Harpers Ferry along the Norfolk & Western, Baltimore & Ohio, and the Southern Railways. 'l'he latter work was executed at the request of the United States Geological Survey which furnished the funds for the field expenses. A party of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was engaged during the first five months of the fiscal year in determining astronomic longitudes and latitudes· and occasionally azimuths at triangulation stations in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois. The astronomic data secured are essential to the adjustment of the triangulation of the eastern half of the country.

As shown in the table the principal magnetic work has been in the section of the country lying eastward of a line from southern Texas to western Pennsylvania, an area in the northwest, and in the interior of Alaska. In the latter survey observations were made at points never hitherto reached for this purpose. Continuous recording of the magnetic elements was in progress at five magnetic observatories. The hurricane destroyed several buildings at San Juan, P. R., but fortunately not those containing the essential magnetic instruments, and these have been kept in operation. New methods which facilitate observations have been put in effect at a number of observatories. Cooperative n;i.agnetic observations were carried on at Duke University, Durham, N. C. Special auroral observations were made at Sitka. Seismol,ogy.-InstrumentaI observations have been made at Tucson, Sitka, at the cooperative stations at the University of Hawaii and the University of Chicago, and at the San Juan Observatory up to the time of the hurricane. No observations have been made in Porto Rico since that time. Several new seismographs have been tested at Cheltenham, which is used primarily for this purpose. · The collection of reports on the visible and felt effects of earthquakes as made by volunteer observers is becoming better organized. The inspector in charge of the field station at San Francisco has done important work in organizing the collection of reports in the Pacific coast region.
TIDE AND CURRENT WORK

In addition to numerous short series of tide observations along the coasts of the United States and p6ssessions in connection with hydrographic surveys, tide observations were continued at primary tide stations of the bureau for the purposes of furnishing general tidal control for hydrographic surveys in the various regions represented and for the determination of tidal datum planes.

In continuing the program of tide and current .suryeys of important: harbors; Chesapeake Bay·· and .tributaries . were. ,completed during the fiscal year. Because .of the -wide :extent 'of :the waterways comprising this s;yste1ri' two .field seasons were necessai~y, ·the upper part of the bay bemgsurveyed·in the fiscal.year 1928 and.the lower in 1929. During the ·past fiscal year 106 current stations and· 23: tide stations were obser·ved during this survey. The results have been tabulated and reduced and the manuscrir.t for a publication on· tides and currents .in Chesapeake Bay and tributaries· is nearing completion and will be sent to the printer early in the present fiscal year. In the last month of the fiscal l.ear 1.929 ·a tide. and. curr~nt s:urvey of .

This gage is operate at no cost to the survey. Through a cooperative arrangement between this survey and the Chamber of Commerce of Cordova, Alaska, a series of tide observations is being obtained at that place. At the request of the city of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a portable automatic tide gage has been established at that place to be operated for a period of about a year. In order to furnish data in connection with a lawsuit to which the Government is a party, two fortable automatic tide gages were maintained during the month o February in the vicinity of Bennings Bridge, D. C., in cooperation with the United States Army Engineers. Members of the division were called upon to testify in court as expert witnesses in connection with this case. In addition to the tide records, temperature and density observations-frequently requested by operators of cold-sto11age J;>lants, by fishing concerns, and by investigators of the ravages of pile-boring i~were made at all primary tide stations at no rncrease of cost to the Government. Short series of these observations were also :made at all current stations occupied in the current survey of Chesa· . Peake Bay and tributaries. The following cooperation was given the Coast and Geodetic Survey in tidal work during the year : The primary tide station at Annapolis, Md., which is operated cooperatively by this bureau and the Naval Academy was put into operation on August 7, 1928. Aside from serving as a primary tide station, it is also to be used for the purpose of instructing the midshipmen in tidal work.

The organization of the Washington office of the bureau is presented by the organization chart opposite. The accomplishments during the fiscal year by divisions and sections follow.
CHIEF CLERK

The principal duties of this division are the care, custody, and upkeep of the building occupied by the bureau; the supervision of the expenditures for office expenses, including the purcfiase of supplies for the office and to some extent for the field; the care of most of the original records of the field surveys, as well as the library of printed publications; the general supervision of all matters relating to the personnel work, rncluding reports of leaves of absence; the custody and accounting for the receipts from the sale of charts: publication, ere. ; and the direction of the employees engaged in the care, maintenance and protection of the buildings occupied by the bureau in the District of Columbia. · In the library and archieves 109 hydrographic and 87 topographic sheets, each representing new surveys made by the bureau, were received. Other additions were blue prints (mostly showing surveys made by Army Engineers), 616; maps, 3,253; charts, 2,346; field, office, and observatory records, 3,913; photographs and negatives, 171; prints, 400; lantern slides, 156; books, 467. The total number of permanent and temporary employees in the office and field forces, which includes commissioned officers and all employees appointed through civil-service certification, is: Offi~e force, 221; field force, 199; total, 420. These figures do not include the persons engaged as rodmen, chainmen, heliotropers, and others.in the field parties nor any enlisted men on vessels. The statistics in regard to leave of absence during the calendb.X: year are: Annual leave, 7,459 days; sick leave, 1,829 days; wit}lOlit-' puy leave, 285 days; accrued leave, 3,264 days. · While the nuipber pf employees naturally varied on account of resignations and ·vacancies, calculated on the number actually in the service on ,June 30, 1929; as a basis of computation, the average annual leave taken during the year by each employe{}. was approximately 17.37 days .and, sick leave 4.35 days. · . . The receipts from the sale of charts and nautical publications'pre~ pared by the bureau amounted to $65,545.42. · The funds 'realize<! from the sale of 'old property, work done, and miscellaneous sources amounted to $4,707.63. · · · ·· ' · ,
. DIVISION OF HYDROGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY · '"

The work performed by the administrative and other officers, of this division stationed at the Washington office is quite diversified. It consists of the preparation of plans and instructions for fi~ld sµr~ veys, the supervision of field work, and the exam:iriation of ,the'records

of field parties. These officers prepare plans and specifications for new vessels and for hydrographic surveying equipment. They also supervise repairs and upkeep of the vessels. Research work is carried. on in connect.ion with. new s_µrveyip.g m,ethods and appliances. Durmg the past year experiments were made on a new. tYJ?e of echosounding apparatus for use in shallow .water and a new mstrument was· devised for getti:i;i.g more accurate measurement of deep water by ineans of echo sounding. A course ofinstrµction was crifried out in ihe division for the education of field officers in· the use of echosounding apparatus and sound ;ranging.. All field officers stationed in Washington took this course of instruction. 1'he preparation of manuscript for· coast pilots and· inside route pilots :was perfor~ed by, the coast· pilot ·section. of the division from mfor.rpation obt~in.ed by !LU officer of the. division who made a:. thor~ ough field inspeet~on of .the area covered by the coast pilot. This section compiled during the year a publication. contttin,ing .tables for ascer~aining navigable distapces between the pol'.ts of the United States ports to a number. of foreign pqrts. This publication lists over 400 ports an,d. points on inland w:aterways and is. intended to supplement the series of coast pilots .by.providing a, convenient means fo.r ascertaining navigable di$tances between the .ports ·of .the United States and its offlying territories. ··

The printing and distribution of charts increased by more than 7,000 copies during the year. This is approximately the normal annual increase that has been continuing for the past 15 years. The sale of tide.tables and current tables'is the largest we have ever had. These are substantial evidences of growth. There are many indications that during the coming year this volume will be exceeded. There is a persistent demand from various sources for charts of localities not .previously published .. Charts of several rivers and comparatively shoal areas heretofore considered unimportant for navigation but now coming into importance on account of the phenomenal increase in the number of motor boats are on our program. The addition of a new chart to the number on issue requires not only the work of compilation and preparation of plates but also continuous correction, year after year; work which is already taxing the capacity of the division. This demand for charts of new areas must be met to the best of our ability and between 1925 and 1929, 31 new charts have been added to the list on issue. Photographic copies of original survey sheets are quite extensively used in the study of important engineering projects as base maps for local improvements and assessments and as evidence in litigation involving valuable property rights. These records are hi$'hly valuable judging by the number of complimentary letters received. Tfie J)ro.gress in airway mapping has fallen behind the increasing deman for airway charts.. The production of strip maps is being curtailed to permit undertaking general flying maps which will eliminate considerable duplicat10n caused 1by overlapping strips. AccompUslzments fi:Jr the year.-There were 13 new nautical charts produced and 10 new editions of existing charts; 3 airway strii:> maps published, 5 reprinted, and 5 nearin.[t completion. All existing charts were keJ?t up to date and weekly .Notices to Mariners prepared for publicat~on. ·· Below 'iS gi-ven a 5-year comparative statement showing the total number of nautical charts on issue, the new charts constructed and new editions issued during the year; also the cancellations of ob~olete charts. On account of very e:i..'tensive corrections several of the 84 new editions· listed for 1929 required practically as much work new chart.

REPORT TO THE SECRETARY, OF COMMERCE

The charting program for 1930 includes 13 new nautical charts 5 charts to be reconstructed, 9 new airway strip maps, 2 sectional charts of a series that will eventually cover the entire country. The wo.rk of first importance will be keeping existing charts up to date.
DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM AND SEISMOLOGY

The principal accomplishments have been: 1. The resumption of preparation of magnetic observatory results for publication. Progress has been made though the amount is unsatisfactory. Further improvements in methods have been made. 2. Preparation of the field results for publication. This has been kept practically up to date. 3. Preparation of the magnetic tables and charts for 1925 was completed. This publication should meet the need for which it is prepared for many years. 4. Progress has been made in the preparation of magnetic 'information by groups of States. A volume covering the area from Delaware to Tennessee was practically completed and the necessary maps compiled. 5. A program of development of instruments and methods with study of the underlying theory has been an important activity. There have been. improvements in the standard methods and new materials and apparatus have been adopted for solving the problems as they have become available. 6. Attention has been given to some of the major problems relat-. ing to the earth's magnetism, and a special effort has been made to keep in touch with all the various organizations throughout the earth which are now very actively attackm~ this problem. Special mention should be made of coo~ation with the Navy Department and the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
SEISMOLOGY

Only a partially successful effort has been made to put the available information into finished form. The delay in the issue of our quarterly seismological report has become quite serious but in so far as other observatories are concerned their needs have been met by advance information from our observatories. Immediate deterllllnation of pm;ition of earthquakes through reports from cooperative organizations and observatories has proved so valuable that upon request from Great Brita.in the service has included transmission of earthquake information to Europe as part of the meteorological messages of the Weather Bureau. Advice and information has been furnished to those contemplating the installation of instruments and other various activities related to the earthquake problem. .
DIVISION OF TIDES AND CURRENTS

Owing to the increased calls for tide and current data and because of the additional data obtained from the current and tide surveys the work in the office of the division of tides and currents has increased considerably in the past few years, without a commensurate increase in the personnel.

· Upon the completion of a tide and current survey, one of which is made in a different harbor each summer, the observations are reduced and the manuscripts for special publications on the tides .and currents in these harbors are prepared for printing in the next fiscal , vear. The survey of Chesapeake Bay and tributaries was completed early in the past year and manuscript is now being prepared for . publication. These comprehensive tide and current surveys were begun in 1922, and to the present time the following special publications, dealing with tides and currents in the respective harbors, have been issued: Currents and tides in harbors

S:{>ecial Publication 148, Tidal Bench Marks, State of New Jersey, . received from the printer during the fiscal year, is part of a series containing descriptions and elevations of tidal bench marks along the coasts of the United States. The following are publications of this series issued to the present time :

Special Publication 154, Instructions, Primary Tide Stations, which was pre.Pared as a supplement to Special Publication 139, was sent to the prmter in January, 1929. This publication contains instructions pertaining to the operation of a primary tide station and the prelminary reduction of the records. Two new publications that were issued during the fiscal year, Tide Table, Boston Harbor and Vicinity, and Tidal Current Charts, New York Harbor, have been well received by the public, the unexpected demand for the current charts necessitating a re:{>rint within a few months of the original issue. This publication gives by means of a. set of 12 charts the direction and velocity of the current at various localities throughout New York Harbor. In addition to this information, the complete set of charts presents a comprehensive view of the tidal-current movement for the harbor as a whole. At the present time we have insistent demands for similar publications for San Francisco Bay, Boston Harbor, and Chesapeake Bay, where current surveys have already been made and observational data are available. The predictions of tides and currents are made and the manµscript submitted to the printer each year in time to have all the tables for any calendar year ready for issue by July 1 of the preceding calendar year. Predictions of currents for the current tables for the calendar year 1931 were begun October 30, 1928, and completed November 30, 1928. Tide predictions for the tide tables for the calendar year 1981 were begun November 30, 1928, and completed January 22, 1929.

The United States and Foreign Ports Tide Tables for 1929 contain daily predictions for 88 reference stations and tidal differences and constants for 3,775 subordinate stations. One additional reference station, Aberdeen, Grays Harbor, Wash., was included in the 1930 edition. In accordance with a cooperative arrangement for the exchange of tidal predictions, daily predictions for the annual tide tables are now exchanged between the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the following organizations: British Admiralty, 19 stations; Canadian Hydrographic Office, 4 stations; Deutsche Seewarte1 Germany, 6 . stations; anJ Service Hydrographique, France, 4 stations. The production of tide and current tables has been systematized and a high degree of efficiency attained. Only nominal improvements can now be hoped for along these lines, as the present con<litions are such that any further speeding up must result in loss of accuracy.
DIVISION OF ACCOUNTS

For the fiscal year 1929 the regular appropriations for the Coast and Geodetic Survey amounted to $2,445,127. This amo4nt was further increased to $2,527,627 by deficiency acts, transfers from other depa1·tments, etc. The actual disbursements during the fiscal year amounted to $2,587,862.02. This amount does not represent the actual expenses of the bureau for the fiscal year 1929, as included therein arc disbursement on account of previous fiscal years.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

During the year from 30 to 50 chiefs of party have disbursed funds in the field, operating throughout the entire United States and its possessions. These chiefs of party are financed by advances made to them through this division, and their accounts are in turn rendered to this division for credit to their account of advances. They are then included in the accounts of the disbursing agent, and are transmitted to the General Accounting Office for final settlement. The primary object for these chiefs of party being in the field is the accomplishment of surveying work, and it is, and has been, the continued endeavor of this division to simplify the accounting work in every possible manner in order that a maximum of effort may be devoted by these chiefs of party to their surveying work. The majority of these officers have no permanent station, their work bemg migratory. The accounting work is necessarily accomplished at night after completing the day's work in the field, and under the most difficult conditions, as, for instance, by lamplight in a small tent with only the crudest facilities.
INSTRUMENT DIVISION

The development, procurement, modification, and servicing of the surveying instruments used by the field parties and observatories of this bureau in its work o.f geodetic, hydrographic, magnetic, tidal surveys, and other activities is the function of the bureau's instrument division. This division also records all material transfers to, from, and between field parties and the Washington office, and accounts for material at the bureau's headquarters. It is also the function of this division to design such special instruments and equipment as may be needed, to prepare drawings and specifications, and to construct sample instruments. It is also frequently necessary for this organization to design and build special machines to perform some of the highlv accurate and special work which is occasioned by the construction of the various precision instruments which the bureau uses. These various functions were carried on during the past year, and a number of new instruments and improvements were made, the more important being: Precise level rod.-Yve have steadily improved the level rod both in its construction and in the method of di vi ding it. 'Ve have been able to develop a rod which will be of longer life, and so -stable that there will not be appreciable changes in length due to usage. By the designing and constructing in our own .shop of a special dividing machine we have been able to graduate these rods with a much higher degree of accuracy, and calibration is now carried one decimal place farther than was .formerly possible. By means of this. machine all rods are practically ahlrn and we are experimenting, with, ·r understand, very favorable results, with a change in the method of conducting the leveling work whereby it is not necessary to reverse the positions of. the forward and rear rods with each set-up, and the preliminary tests show a speeding up of from 10 to 15 per cent. . Second-order theodolite.-This instrument, whose design was referred to in last year's report, has been under construction during ,

REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE

the yenr and is virtually completed. A notable improvement in its design has been made in the introduction of ball bearings· into the micrometer microscopes, which renders them extremely sensitive and makes them adjustable and practically free from the effects of wear. An important element of such microscopes is the reversibility of the micrometer screw. The introduction of ball bearings renders the operating parts so lacking in friction that movement is virtually instantaneous in either direction on rotation of the screw. This will result in speedier and more accurate observation. Engine-driven sounding maohine.-A new portable, . air-cooled, gasoline· engine-driven sounding machine has been develo:ped for launch work and is now under field test. This machine is quite light, very powerful, and its entire control is in one hand of the ·operator. This machine will enable shallow soundings to be conducted with much greater ease and rapidity than where the hand sounding machine is used. · Registering sheave..-The registering sheave used by this bureau in deep-sea sounding was redesigned to incorporate a more rugged and more easily read and operated registering device, and a number of these instruments were placed in the field for testing purposes. A new type of automatic time switch for the control of signal lamps, to eliminate the constant need of an attendant, was designed and built during the year. This switch makes use of a drop of ·mercury sealed mto a glass tube properly mounted on suitable metal parts, connected with a clock. This type of switch will not be affected by moisture, temperature, or dirt, nor is there any tendency for the tarnishing of contacts, as in the case of some of the switches previously used. A quantity of these switches is being used durmg the present season. Efforts are continually being made to improve the quality and accuracy of the instruments, and to reduce their cost by the use of improved materials and methods of construction. Every effort is made to reduce the operating expense of the shops by the introduction of labor-saving machinery, and by adding suitable apparatus for testing incoming instruments and materials.
