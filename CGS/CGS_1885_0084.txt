"C°NITED STA TES COAST .AND GEODETIC SUitVEY OFFICE,

W a11hingf-On, December 9, 1885.

Sm: 'The report of progress mafle in the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey during the fiscal year ending .Tnne ::10, 18~U, which [have the honor to submit herewith, a>; required b,> law, a11<l hy the regulations of the 'I'reasnry Department, is accompanied by maps showing the general a<lvance of the snrvey on the Atlantic, Gulf of :\Iexico, antl Pacific coasts antl in the iuterior of the Unite1l 'ltat<·s, :11111 hy an nppernlix exhibiting- in tabnlar form the distribution of the several 1mrties, the 11.itnre of their work, iwd the localities of their operations. In ifa arrangement, this r_eport conforms to that adopted in the recent reports of the Superintendeu t of this nurean. Part I prt-seuts general statements of progress under the seveml heads of field-work, officework, discoveries, and developments, and special scientific work; it gives also an explanation or estimates and estimates in detail for the Ji.seal year 1886-1887. Part II is occupied with summaries of work afloat and ashore as derived from the reports of chiefs of parties during the past fiscal ;year. It closes with references to the office work. In Part III are comprised the seYeral appendices which relate to field, office, an cl hydrographic tletails, and also those appendices which pre11ent tbe metliods, discussions, and results of the survey ill forms deemed worthy of 1rnblication. The important step taken h.Y tbe last Congress in appointing a Joint Commission of three Senatorsaml three Representatin~s to "consider the present organizations of the Signal Service, Geological Sun'ey, Ooast and Gernletfo Survey,and the Hydrographic Office of the Na,·y Department, with the view to rsecnre greater efficiency and economy of administration of the public service in said Bureaus," led, as is well known, to a request from that Commiflsion that tlte Nat.ional Academy of Sciences would appoint a committee of its members to examine the subject, and give the Joint Commission the benefit of their special knowledge of the questions involved. In pur1miug their inquiries, tl1e committee of the Academy requersted from the Superintendent through the Secretary of the Treasury a statement of the organization and present condition of the OoMt and Geotletic Survey. This statement accompanied the report of the Aca1le.my to the Commis8ion. lt embotlies views deemed worthy of consideration re.<1pecti11g the relations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to other Government sun'eys, an<l the methoth1 by which the functions of these sernral surveys may be clearly dctiued, allil their co-ordination well t>stahlished. lt has been 1mblishetl by t.he Academ,r in their annmtl report, aml appc1trs also in the 'fe13timouy before the ,J oiut Oommission (Senate .1\lis. Doc. No. 82, :Forty-ninth Congress, first session). The reasons urged in the last annual report for an increase in the amount approprintecl for Jlarty expenses, or the cost of field work, afloat aml ashore, it is gratifying to record, met with cordial support from the Department, and were recognized, though not to the fnll extent desired, by Congress. These reasons have lost none of their force, and I would again urge an increase in the sum available for party expenses to the amount asked for in. the estimates.

PART I.
It is 'Believed that durmg the past fiscal year the progress of the Survey in all of its branches has been commensurate with the means afforded by Congress. And although in certain sections, operations have b~en necessarily restricted, or temporarily suspended for want of funds, yet every effort has been made, consistently with the terms of the appropriation, to push work in important localities, as is shown in the advance towards completion of the resurveys of Long Island Sound and Delaware Bay, the beginning of the resurvey of New York Bay and Harbor, the investigation of the currents in the Gulf Stream, and of the changes in the bar at San Francisco Entrance. The distribution of the land and water parties on the .Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts and in the interior of the United States is shown in .Appendix No. 1, in the geographical order heretofore obserYed. In the course of the bydrographic operations, some important developments were made to which the attention of persons iutereste~l in commerce and navigation was promptly called. Statements in detail of these discoveries and developments are gi >en in Part II; they are referred to also under a special heading in this part of the report. Among them may be mentioned the location of rocks and rocky ledges off the coasts of Maine and Massachusetts; the location of shoals hitherto uncharted in Vineyard Sound, and the development of changes in the main ship·channel in that sound; the discovery of dangerous ledges in the course of the resurvey of Long Island Sound; the location of a dangerous rock in East River, New York, near Diamond Reef, anu the development. of Sabine Bank, off Sabine Pass, Gulf of Mexico. Operations afield and afloat have been carried on within the limits or off the coasts of thirtytwo States, two Territories, and in the District of Columbia. The tra1111continental geodetic work intended to unite the survey of the .Atlantic with that of the Pacific coast is making progress simultaneously from the .Atlantic coast westward and the Pacific coast eastward, and is advancing toward a junction. Trigonometrical surveys were continued in nine States, which have made requisite provision for their own topographical and geological surveys. This work in the interior, carried on by authority of the act approved March 3, 1871, is gradually establishing an exact skeleton or framework, by means of which accurate base-lines are afforded for State surveys, by which the lines ·of the public land surveys can be checked in position and direction, and by which t.be preparation of accurate State maps is rendered possible. The practical advantages and scientific aims of such a general framework, which must of necessity be under national control, are concisely set forth in the report of Superintendent J.E. Hilgard to the National Academy of Sciences, bearing date of September 19, 1884.

IV.-SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC WORK.
THE SECULAR VARIATION AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE MAGNETIC DIP AND IN'l'ENSITY IN THE UNITED STA·.rES.

In Appen<lix No. 6 is given an elaborate report by Assistant Charles A. Schott on the secular variation and geographical distribution of the magnetic dip and intensity iu the United States. It pre1>ents a discussion of these elements, based upon a general collection of all observed values known to the author from the earliest times, and constitutes the last part of the magnetic researches respecting secular variation and distribution which for many years past have been in progress in the Survey. The secular \ariation and geographical distribution of the decliuation were discussed in papers which appeared as Appendices Nos. 12and13 to the Report for 1882. January, 1885, is the epoch of reduction adopted for each element. An interesting result of the discussion of the secular variation of the dip is that Mr. Schott bas been enabled to recognize and delineate a belt of "no change'? for the epoch adopted, with annually iucreasing dip on one side an<l decreasing dip on the other. A similar feature was recognized in the discussion of the secular change of the horizontal intensity, the absolute measures for which date back hardly half a century. These results, with the isocliuic and isodynamic curves, a.re graphically represented in the three maps and three diagrams which accompany the paper. One of tltese diagrams is a combination of the changes in declination and dip, showing the actual mo,·ement of a freely suspended rnagut·tic needle for the period from 1820 to 1885.
ADJUSTMENT AND REDUCTION OF '£HE DAVIDSON QUADRILATERALS.

Jn Appernlix No. 9 are presented the resultsoftbe geodetic connection of the Yolo Base with the first. Ride of the prinrnry triangulation of Ualiforuia, forming part of what are known as the Davidilon quadrilateral!'. This paper, prepared by Assistant Schott, exhibits the reimlts of the least l'1qnare iuljnstment of a figure composed of seYeu stations and seventeen triangle :sitles, contaiuing se,·enteen geometrical co1Hlitions. Sufficient detail is given to show the treatment by the Computing- Dh-i>don of ob><erYa tiomi of tlw first class, and the degree of accuracy reached in the results. lt wiil ht· st·t·n that t.lwsc obsl'ITatioas, whether compared with our own or with foreign measures, i;html iu the tirst order of precision, and they may well be taken as a piece of work representative of the accurac;y attainable in modern triangulation. Respecting the anal,ytical treatment, the sul~ject of weights relath-e to the measured directions has receh'ed special attention, forming one of its distinguishing features, ·and the introduction of the p1·ocess for the computation of the probable error of a resulting side will be found of interest.
GEOGRAPHICAL POSITIONS AND HEIGHTS OF UPWARDS OF ONE THOlTSAND STATIONS IN THE S'l'ATE OF MASSACHLTSETTS, AND GEOGRAPHICAL POSITIONS OF .ADOU'l' THREE HUNDRED STATIONS IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND.

It is proposed to publish from time to time, as results become available, tables of geographical positions and heights in the several States in which the work of the survey is making progress. Appendix No. 8 contains the geographical positions aud heights of upwards of one thousand stations in the State of :Massachusetts and the geographical poKitions of about three hundred stations in the State of IU10de Island. Of the positions in Massachusetts, about one hundred were determined by the triang\Ilation of that State exeeuted by Simeon Borden between 1832 and 1838. A few points were esta blislied by the same triangulation in the State of Rhode Islaud. All of Mr. Borden's positions have been reeom1mted in this office in order to refer them to the standard tlata of the Survey.

A PLEA FOR A LIGHT ON SAINT GEORGE'S BANK.

7

In Appendix No. 11, Assistant Henry Mitchell presents an urgent plea for the establishment of a light on Saint George's Bank. This great danger to seamen, l,yiug upon the tllrei;lwhl of the Gulf of Maine, and 100 miles from the nearest land, is, a,s a shoal, far more dangerous than it would be as an island, and yet, as Mr. Mitchell obserYes, it is unmarked and undistinguishable except by its hideous roar when the ship is already within its breakers. As a warning and guiding mark to the ocean commerce of the Atlantic coast, and espedally as it friendly signal to the fisliing fleet of the Gulf of Maine, numbering at times four hundred wssels, carr;ying four thousand men, fishing on the Georges or crossing the shoals en route to more distant grounds, the benefits of such a light would be incalculable.
COMPARISON OF TRANSVERSE SECTIONS OF THE DELAWARE RIVER BE1'Wl<iEN OLD NAVY-YARD AND EAST END OF !'ETTY'S ISLAND, AS DERIVED FROM 'I'IIE SURVEYS OF 1819, HH3, AND

1878.

The study of the chan~es in the channel-depths and cross-sections of Delaware Rh·er, undertaken of late years by Assistants Henr.v Mitchell and H. L. l\fariudiu, is of immecliate practical utilit~· as bearing upon the effect of the construction of wharves and piers in contributing to such chauges. Assistant Marindin presents in .Appendix No. 12 a comparison of changes in trarnn-erse sections of that part of the river which embraces the principal part of the harbor of Phil:t<lelphia. His conclusions, as stated iu the pa1wr, and as graphicall:v reprrscnted in tht' diagrams aceompa 11yiug, are derived from the surveys of 1819, 1843, and 1878, a111l will laarn sprdal nlltw for tlie Uuitt·!l States Advisory CommiRRio11 011 the irnpron·ment of the navigat.ion of tl1e Delaware.
HARMONIC ANALYSIS OF THE TIDF.S AT GOVERNOR'S ISLAND, NEW YORK HARBOR.

In reports previously sulnnitted and published as apperulices to tlie annual reports of the Survey, the metlwd of harmonic analysis has beeu applied liy Prof. 'Villiam Ferrd to the discussion of the tides of Penobscot Bay, of ~auds Hook, and of tlie Pacific coast (Appendices Nos. 11 of 1878, 9 of 1883, and 17 of 1882). The priuciples of tliiis wethod were fully set forth, with rules,fommlru, and examples of the Yinious reductions in the paper relating to the Pe11obseot Bay tides. In Appendix No.13 to this report is presenteu Professor Ferrel's paper on the harmonic anal,Ysis of the. hourly co-ordinates of the heights of the tides at Governor's Island, New York Ilarbor, for the years 1876, 1877, and 1878. These hourly co-ordinates were measurt'd from the currns recorded by the self-registering tide-gauge which had been maintained at that locality for many years. Professor Ferrel remarks that there is a very great similarity between the tides at Go\·ernor's Island and those at Sandy Hook; that the amplitudes of all the separate tidal components are very nearly the same for both stations, but that, as was to be expected, the epochs at Governor's Island are somewhat greater, causing the tide to be about twenty-nine ruinutes later at that station than at Sandy Hook.

UNITED STA.TES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

EXPLANATION 01'' ESTIMATES.

The estimates submitted to the Department for the fiscal year 1886-1887 were accompanied by the following statement:
UNITED ST.A.TES Co.A.ST AND GEODETIC 8URVEY OFFICE,

Washington, OctQber 12, 1885. I have the honor of submitting herewith the estimates of the appropriations required for the United States Coast and Geodetic Suryey, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1887, and respectfully request your approyal thereof. If it were definitely determined that the Oo:u1t and Geodetic Survey should continue to exist as a separate bureau, an immediate modification of its existing plan of organization, in>olving a corresponding modification in itR efficiencJ· and cost, would seem to be advisable. Such a modificatiou sl1ould involYe a reduction in the number and expense of the field, or so-called ';normal force,'~ aml an increase in it" f'fficie11cy h~· the Plimination of the i1wffrf'tin'. member,., hy so classi(yi11g the rc:;itln,· a-; to stin11tlatl' tltP jn11ior ele11a·ut 1t·ith a 111o"pect 11f rca,;011abl,\· <"arly promotion as the rewanl of t<kill and act.i dt~·. and l>.r abolishiug entirel,v the R,Yf'tem of payments ancl promotions upon the baRilS of longevity anil pntting them absolntely, as far as practicable, upon the basis of merit as in<li~ated by tbe im1iddnal records of work performed. In Yiew, ltoWe\·er, of tlie refrrence of matters relating to the organization of tks and certa.in other lmreans of the HoYernrnent to a joint commission appointed lly Congress, and the consequent uucertaiut.r im·oh·ing the immediate fntnrn of this bureau, l lrn\·e n·it felt warra,nted in attempting to anticipate CongrPssioual action h~· submitting e,;timates prrdicatecl upon an experimental aml tc111porar~· ;;clwme of reorg~rnizatim1. The aceompa11yi11g- sdietlule of estimatkls is therefore made up<rn the lmsi<:\ of the existin~· plau of org-a11izatio11 of the bnrnau as embodied in tlie Hegu. lations for the government of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, issued from the Treasury Department February 18, 1881. While the aggregate au1ount a>'ked for, $568,060, is Romewhat larger than the amount appropriated for tlw current J·ear, $M3,.Hl6.:~9, it is less by tlie snm of $ffi,510 than the amount askecl for the current year. The amount aske<l for the v:Hionis classes of fiehl·\HJrk is $:~2,800 more than the amount appropri:tted for that class of work for the current year, while the amount asked for pa~ of field officers, ottice force, and office expenses is $<18,236.im less than the amount appropriated for the current J·ear for those item::; of expense. In other words, the estimates now submitted contemplate the performance of more work at a less co'i\t for salaries and office expenses than was practicable under the appropriations for the current ,rear. 'fhe estimates for "Party 'BxpenseR," including work of l<'nrnisl1ing- points for State surveys, for Transcontinental Geodetic work, aml for Re1iun···ysof New York Harbor and San Prancisco Bay, &c., co,·er the pay of those temporarily emploscd as reconlern, sigual-men, hands, cooks, drivers, or boatmen, or in any other capacity except m; members of the permanent or normal force; the subsistence of the chiefs mal employes of parties; traveling expenses to aud from the field, and local transportation in the dcinity of field work; the transportation of inRtruments, tents, stationery, materials, outfit, and equipage to and from tbe field and in the field; and the purchase of all requisite materials, supplies, tents, boats, stationery, camp equipage, and all other necessary expenses properly inciclent, to the prosecution of the work in tbe field. A.n increase of the appropriation for "Party l<Jxpenses," as compared with the appropriations under that head for the current year, is, I beli1we, absolutely necessary to'' a proper economic proportion between tbe expense of putting the ntrious parties in the field a,nd the length of time that they can be kept at work." After deducting from each appropriation for specific work the expense

of transporting the field part~· and eqnipage to and from the locmlity of that work, Urn balance of the appropriation measurrn' the amount of efiectfre field work capable of lll'ing done. To so stint the appropriation as to compel the withdrawal of parties from tlw field llefore tlle expiration of tlle season favorable to effective work, shortens the peeiocl of acti \'C' work, lt>ugthens the lJeriod of comparative i<lleness, increases the aggreg1ite cost, and delay,.; the fi11al completion of the work, and is therefore a measure of false economy. In conformity with the views of Congress its mdicatt>cl in the appropriation for the current year, the estimates are itemized for tlie various purposes mentioned. Under that form of appropriation, the degree of caution necessary to avoitl incurriug- deficieucie,.; compels the withdrawal of parties from the field llefore tlie amounts appropriated fol' tlieit· re.;pectirn s<~hemes of work are expended. This results in the untimely interruption of mnch of tlie work, and in the creation of unexpended balances available for no purpose in the pt'omot:iou of the business of the Bnrean, unless a sufficient proportion of th<>. appropriations can be 11m<le interchang-eallle to cover deficiencies resulting from the continuance of field work iu some localities as long as favorable climatic comlitions justify it. The ten per centum of interchtrngeahility of the appropriations for the current ftscal Jear does not afford a sufficient margin to enable the Superintmueut to adapt the expenditures and the field-work to the varying conditions of the Yariom; localities, and :;o to produce the best results from the amounts ex1w1Hled. It is therefore earnestly hoped that upon that. point the suggestion of the estimates may he incorporated iuro the appropriation act antl :w per cent. of the amounts appropriated for "party ex.penses" be 111ad11 a\·ailab1e intercl.J.augeably for expenditure on the objects named. In making estimates for salarie~, the phrase "not exceetliug- '' is emplo.red "·ith the purpm1e of determining their maximum, leaving without apparent limitatinn the authority of the Seeretary of the Treasury or the Superi11te11llent tu reJulle auy of tlll~JU in his di,,;cretiou. Iu apportioning the amounts aske<l for, the idea of prosecuting tlw survey of the coasts-the 01iginal purpose of this Bureau-to au early completion has been kept constantl,v in view. In recognition of the practical value of geodesy to ex.act reslllts iu surn:_ys of the public domain, as wtlll as with a view t-0 the maintenance of the honorable disti1wtion achie\·ed by this country in the scientific world, the estimate is somewhat increased l>eyond the amount appropriated for the current year for geodetic work, the scientific importauce of which has enlisted in its prose· cution abroad an association of the leading Governmeuts of Emope. It is hoped that the amount asked for resurvey of :N'e\Y York Harbor will be sufficient to complete the work, the progress of which during- the current J·ear has tlevelopetl several dangers to navigation in those waters. Included in the estimates is the sum of $30,000 for the resurn'y of Sau Fraucisco Bay and of the Straits of Karquines, and examination of San Fraucisco Ba.r and entrance, and of the mouths of the Sacramento and San ,Toaqnin Rivers. The importance of these waters to the great commerce of the Pacific, and the marked changes eoustantl,y oc('nrri11g in their character since the former surveys were concluded, which changes are largely due to t!Je deposits of debris from hydraulic mining and from the heavy freshets to which the ri\'ers mentioned are subject, render such resurvey highly desirable. Very respectfully, .F. M. THORN,

PART II.
This part of tLe report is occupied by statements in detail of operations afield and afloat, ancl by a summary of tile work of' the office. Its arrangement mH.ler the heads of sections is the same as that lieretof'ore adopted. Appendix No. 1 presents in a g·eogrnphical order the distribution of the field parties: in Appendix No. 4 i:-i givPn the n~port of th1~ Ai-;sif;taut in charge of the office. The 1lireetion of office operations was contiuueil duriug the ;\'Par with AsRistant Charles 0. Boutelle, whose assigument to that dut;y <latex from .lauuary, 188-t. l\lueli of thP time that he could :-ipare from administrative work was deYoted to the arr;H1gemP11 t and prpparation for publication of a new and enlarged edition of the projection tables, the computation:-; for which were made under bis personal supervision. These tables were publi1:1lted as Appemlix No. (i to the Report for 1884, and Rupersede all former pr~jection tables published by the Survey. Commander C. M. Chester, U. S. N., remained on duty as Hydrogrnphic Inspector during the year. He had charge of the detailR of all hydrographic work, acting as chief adviser and executive officer of tiw Superintendent in matters pertaining to hydrography. As Inspector of Hyllrography, and as in charge of the repairs and maintenance of the vessels of the Survey, his duties are in the field as well as in the office. The general charge of the Coast Pilot Di dsion of the office is committed to him, a.R also the supervision of the labors of the office hydrographic draughtsmen. Iu App1~ndix No. 5 is gh·en in full Commander Chester's annual report, iu which, in anticipa· tion of hi;; relief from the Coast and Geodetic Survey 8ervice, after having been connected with it for eight years, incl udiug fi \'C ye 1rs 1luty as Hydro graphic lrn;pector, he expres1;es his regret at se\'ering personal relations of 80 pleasant a character and his senHe of obligation for many courtesies recei rnd from his associates in the Survey. The Snperinteudcut takes this occasion to express hiR lligh appreciation of the value of the sen'ice:'l of this able and accomplished officer, and to say that it will not be e:ts_y to replace the professional skill and sonnd judgment, ripened by experi1·nce, which he has brought to the conduct of the work. Administrative details iu the Ilydrograpbic Division were wholly in charge of Lieut. Jefferson F. Mm;;er, U.S. N., Aissi8tant Umist and Geodetic Survey, under whose direction Commander Chester reports that the best results possible are obtained. In December, 1884, Lieut. J.E. Pillsbur~" U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, who had been in immediate charge of the Coast Pilot Division, was relieved and transferred to the commarnl of the steamer Blake. At the mHl of the fiscal year, Lieut. G. II. Peters, U. S. N., AssiRta11t Coast and Geodetic Survey, was as8igned in place of Lieutenant Pillsbury. Mr. Edward H. Wyvill served acceptably as clerk in tile Hydrographic Division; Messrs. E. Willenbucher, W. 0. Willenbucher, and F. C. Donn as draughtsmen. SECTION I.

and endiug of nearly all of the lines being determined hy shore signals, and all lines run on ranges. This work completed the sur\'liy of ::S arraguagns RiYer. On the sheet of Harrington RiYer, two sets of lines were run, one in the direction of and one uorrual to the courstl of the stream and about one hundred meters apart, except in Flat and Back Bays, where the SJSteui was opened to two hundred meters, and in the uanow part of the river, near Harrington, where zigzag- lines were rnn. This surn'y was completed find connected with the work of 1883. Ueuti-mant Heald observes that Flat and Back Bays and the narrow part of Harrington River are almost completely bare at low watPr. Au excellent clrnunel was found through what is known as Dyer's Island Narrows, or the Eastern Passagt>, which if properly buoyed could be navigated b,y coasting steamers at any stage of the tide. The huoys its placed at the time of the survey of Lieutenant Heald he fom1tl to mark a course that was not safe at low water. Owing to the ad·auce of the season it was not found practicable to finish the work on the sheet of Pleasaut Bay and lfo·er, a11d the limit for closing was fixed at the liue joining tlie river and bay. The survey of the bay was complde<l, aud joins with previonR sm··eys in thiR locality. Lines were run as 011 the sheet of Harrington River, one hundred meters apart, except iu the deep part of the bay, where no twideuce of shoal water could be found, when the system was opened to two hundred meters. To determine a planP of reference for the soumlings, tidal obsen'atious were made at the steamboat wharf, l\Iillbritlge, Narraguagm.> Bas. In bis report, Lieutenant Heald takes occasion to express for himself and for the officers who were associated with him the great satisfactiou and pleasure they derh'ed from the extremely accurate delineation of shore-line as gin~n on their projectio11s fro111 the work of the topographi~al parties of the Surrny.

Topographical 8uri·ey in the vi1~inity of Prospect Barbur, Gouldsborough, Me., and resurvey of Bat' Harbor, Mount Desert I.~land, Maine.-Tlle field-work of the topographical party in charge of Assistant A. W. Longfellow, during tlle summer and autumn of 1804, eonsi~ted in adding details of topography to complete the topographical sheet of Prospect Harbor, Gouldsborough, Me., and in a resurvey of Bar Harbor, Mount Desert Island, Maine. Assistant B. F. Dickins was directed to report to Mr. Lougfellow for duty, and joined his party .July 22. From that date till the close of the season, No,Tember 10, ~Ir. Dickins was actively engaged in the field. He finished the plane-table survey of Prospect Harbor September 15, and then took up the resurve.v of Bar Harbor. It had been at first intended to add the new streets, houses, &c., to the topographic sheet of 1873, but the growth. of the town had been so extensive that this was found to be llardly practicable. The houses bad increased since the former sur\'ey from oue hundred and fift~' to upwards of seven hundred, and the new \'ilia~ built upon the hillsides afforded conspicuous landmarks to the navigator. Upon the completion of field-work, Assistants I..o11gt'dlow and Dickins repaired to Portland, wherc trncin~s were made of the plane·til.ble sheets.

that it was quite out of the qnestion to attempt to establish bis camp near tlie summit; hence the instruments and oh1mrd11g tent were sent to the top, while camp was pitched at the base, three miles from the 8tatio11. The Jop of the mountain having been a favorite resort for tourists for thirty years, a hotel had been kept there, and the cupola of this house had been observed upon in the progress of the triangulation. In November, 1883, a se\'l'l'P galP. completely demolished the howl aud scattered its fragment!:! far <low11 the mouutain. 'fbe remornl uf the house did not, howe\·er, prove to be of so much advantage H8 was at first irnticipatPd, since the point Oil the ground corresponding to tlie center of the cupola. was t.oo low to afford an unobstructed view of the horizon. Almost immediately upon the arrirnl of the party the erection of another hotel had been begun, and thifi was pushed forward so rapidly as :soon to obstruct three of the lines of sight from the poiut which was SP.lected as a temporary station. A secoml position wa8 therefore occupied which was adopted as the true . statiou, a11tl the obserration;,; taken from various poinhi upon the old house cupola were reduced to the true station, with refprence to which were determined the positions of the first or eccentric station, and of the chim1wy of the 1ie\y house'. Upon the completion oftlte obserYations of PPquawket, in September, Professor Quimby weut to Trask Hill, thirty mile::~ to the >ion th ward, to measure a horizontal direction, and then visited several points in Rockmglmm Connt:v, amorig them Garrison Hill, in Don't'. He found that it would be nccessar_y to oecup,Y an eccentric stntiou lwre during the next season, the tower on the bill, upon which obsenations hatl heen made from other points, not being suitable for occupation with the theodclite.

The locality of l1is first examination was in Viur,Yard Som11l, between the westeru end of L'Homme Dien Shoal and Nobska light-house. Informatiou had been rcce>iYed at this office from Captain Wright, of the schooner Kate Gifford, through tl1e ll;ydrograpltic Ofticc of the Navy Department, of the existence of au uncharted shoal in this viciuit.\. Lientemrnt-Cornmamler Brownson found two lumps to the westward of L'Bomme Dien Shoal, about five-eighths of a mile distaut, and situated on the following bearings: Nobska light-house, W. if N., two and three-fo11rtl1;; miles. Holmes's Hole (West Uh op) light-house, S. by W. ~ \'\'. WPsterly, two and three-c>igli ths miles. East Chop light-house, S. by E., three aml 011e-eightl1 mile.,. The least water found over the lnmps was twcfre feet.. 'l'licre is 1kcp water aronud them. In the Notice to Mariuers, which was promptly issueil, tlH· following· directions were given: To avoid this shoal in approaching from the t>astwanl, coutiuue on the eoun;e \V. if N. from Succonesset Shoal light-vessel until West Chop light-bou:se hears 8. by \V. 2 W., theu change course to SW. lly W. i W. for two miles, when Nobska light-house will hear N\Y. h.Y W.

Early iu November a rock reported near Gould Iislarnl, Sakouuet Hiver, Rhode Island, was searched for. A ledge was found about ninety feet in length aml thirty feet in width, lying in a W. by S. and E. by N. direction (mag.), with from two to nine feet on it at low water, and with deep water all arouud. This ledge bears W. Ji N. (mag.) from the uorth end of Gould Island, distant about six hundred feet. It ieR 011 S"\V. i' 8. (mag.) beariug- from the draw in tile Stone Bridge. Ifit were buoyed on the eastern ernl, there would be plent~' of room to pass between it and the island. The search tor this ledge was conducted by En!<ign "\Villiam '11 ruxtun. On tbe 8tb of November an examination made b~· Ensigns Edward Simpsc;m and Miles Gorgas showed the existence of a rocky ledge two hundred and twenty· eight feet long and about nine feet wide S. 350 45' W. (ma,g.) from tbe Jight·house ou Dutch Island, Narragansett Bay. The outer end of the ledge is two hundred and eighty-ft\·e feet from high-water mark and four lmmlred and five feet from the light-house.

In11hore hJ/drogra:phfr 11urvey of the northern f'Oa# of Lrmg Island Sound frmn Hammo11a111wtt Point to TFelcl!'11 Point.-In continuation of the hydrographic resurvey of Long Island Sonnd, Lieut. \V. G. Cntl(·r, G. 8. ~.,Assistant Coast and Gt:1odetie Survey, <'Ommanding the schooner Palinnrus, was instrnctecl, at the outset of the fiscal year, to organize bis party on board of that vessel and take up the hy<lrography of the uorth shorn of the Sound between Hammonassett Point aml Welch's or Cedar Point., on the eastern side of Milford Harbor. This survey was begun Juls 18, 188i, antl was completed No,·ember 14. Its resultR are comprised iu four hytlrographic sheets on a scale of 1-10000, with limits as follows: Sheet No. 1, from Hamrnonassett Point to Saclrnm's Head; Sheet No. 2, from Sachem's Head to Branford Beacon; No. 3, from Branford Beacon to Southwest L~dge Light, and No. 4, from Southwest Ledge Ligl1t to \Velclt's Point. The soundings upon ;;heets 1 and 2 were reduced to mean low water of a tide-gauge established on :Falkner's Island; thrnm 011 sheet,.; 3 a11d 4 to mean low water of the Southwest Ledge Lighthouse tide-gauge. Lieutenant. Cutler has l'.'nbmittml a re11ort of his season's work whic1h bears witness to most careful a.ml exhaustirn st.1111,v of the llydrographic characteristics of the localities iucluded in his Rllr\'t\V. Close examinations wen· made of all harbors or anchorages, sailing directions for entering given, aIHl a.II dangers minutely described. His suggestions and notes will be of great value in future editions of the local Coast Pilot. Certain danger1:1 developed bs his survey, and not here-. t.ofore shown on the charts, were brought to public attention b_y the 11ublication of t.he following Notice to Marines, hearing date of November 1, 1884: Six-Mile Reef.-This is an exten..,ive pa.tcl1 of shoa.J ground l,viug near the middle of the Sournl, abont six miles from Clinton, Ooun. The general depth of water co\·ering the reef is from five to seveu fathoms except on a small ledge situate(l near the Wl'stern part of the reef. This ledge is abont one-fourth of a mile in diameter aud has three and one-fourth fathoms on its shoalest spot, which is located 011 the following bearings: · I·'alkner's Island Light-House, WN\Y., se,·en and one-eighth miles.

Northwest Reef.-This is of very small extent, has a depth of six and one-half feet over it, with surrounding depths of five and six fathoms, and is located on the following beariugs: Branford's Reef :Beacou, \VSW., one and one-half miles. Falkner's Island Light-House, ESE., five ttnd three-fourths miles. Lone Tree on Outer Thimble, ENE., seven-eighths of a mile. All bearings in tbis Notice are nmgnetic, all tlistances iu nautical miles, all(l all deptl1s at mean low water. Lieutenant Cutler makes special mention of the fact that Jfranford Heef extends more to the northward than to the southward of the Beacon, and should uot be approached from the northward nearer than about one-fifth of a mile. Branford Harbor he deems a very desirable ancl1orage for vessels drawing ten feet, desiring protection from the eastward, northward, or westward. It is not obstructed by leuges or sunken rocks aml has no dangers wLicli- are not in sigLt or buoyed. With regard to the approaches to New Haven Harbor, he observes that.a breakwater two thousand one hundred and sixty foet in length now extends from South west Ledge Light in the direc· tion of Quixe's Ledge; bence t!Je Light Lists and Buoy Lists, which state that Soutl1west Ledge Light may be approached close to on all Rides, need some modification.

Tidal observations with an automatic tide-gauge at t1ze Light-House on tlte New Hm;en Break· water.-Mention was made in the last annual report of the completion of somewhat more than a year's record of the tides on a self-registering tide-gauge which had been established at Fort 1.rrumbull, New London, Conn. At the beginning of the fiscal year this gauge was transferred to the Light-House on the New Ilaven Breakwater, and a tidal record was begun July 31, 1884, which was continued until December 2. This record was beguu again May 12, 1885, and will be ke1)t ap during the season. It is under the general supervision of the clliefs of hydrograpbic parties in Long Island Sound, and wm furnish a plane of final reference for the soundings as the bydrogra.phy reaches New Haveu Harbor and advances westward. Contin·uation of tlie topographie resurvey of tlie north shore of Long Islattd Sound u:estward from Frost (or Farms) Point, and including tlie Norwalk Island11 / also topograpltical resuri1ey of tlte sliores of East River, New York.-Towards t.he close of .July, 1884, Assistant E. Hergesheimer, under instructions to resume the topographical resurvey of the north shore of Long Island 8ouud and carry it westward from the limits of his pre,·ious season's work, began field operations, ~nd by the 16th of October had completed the topography of the north shore to South Norwalk ancl as far inland as the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad. The survey included also the Norwalk Islands.

For the purpose of noting topographical changes and additions on the water front of the inner· harbor of New York and the East l:tiver, Mr. Hergesheimer left Washington under instructions on the 27th of October, and upon reaching New York made an examination of t!Je water front of East River and the inner harbor, in order to decide in what localities the changes were so marked as to require resurveys, and the extent to which tlfe local municipal surveys could be made available. After completing this examination, November 7, Mr. Hergesheimer returned to the office and submitted a detailed report of it with estimates of cost of surveys. H.Ex.18-4:

At tlie opeuing of tlte season i11 1885 instructions were jssued to Mr. Hergesheimer, acting under which he left vVasbington, April 27, and organized his party for a resurvey of tlte shore topography of the East Hiver from Hed Hook to Throg's Neck. In executing this work he was authorized to make use of such details of previous work by the Coast and Geotletic Survey, by the Department of Surv1ws of Brooklyn, and by the Department of Docks of New York City as upon verification in the field he might find to be trustwortlly. As the work progressed, tracings of shore line were supplied to the 11_ydrographic parties. Mr. Ilergesheimer had completetl one table sheet and transmitted it to the office, and bad begun a second soon after the clrnm of the fiscal year. A fuller account of his work is necessarily reserved for the next annual report. Mr. J. H. Gray was attached to the party as aid during both field seasons, and rendered acceptable sen·ice. Triangulation in the wester·1i part of Long Island Sound exten<ledfrom Lloyd's Neck towards New Roohelle.-At the beginning of the fiscal ;year, the party of Assistant Gershom Bradford was at Oyster Ba_y, Loug Is laud, engaged iu the preliminary work of reconnaissance and lmilding signals for the extension of the triangulation of Long Island Sound westward from Captain's Island on the uorth shore of the Sound and Lloyd's Neck 011 the south shore. With some interruption, owing to delay in the passage of the appropriation, tile work was continued until August 28,when it became oesirable to assigu Mr. Bradford to another field of duty. As already mentioned under the heading of Section I, he reported to Assistant Henry L. Whiting early in September to carry 011 under his general direction a triangulation in aid of the topographical survey of the State of .Massachusetts. After the close of field-work, December 4, in that State, Mr. Bradford was occupied during the winter in compkting his records a11d computations, autl towards tile end of Ma.~·, 1885, was directed to proceed to the western part of Long Island Sound, to furnish }loiuts for the topographical parties at work in that locality, and to continue his work of the season of 1884. 'Vorking eastward from New Rochelle, N. Y., on the north shore, he canied the triangulation to Captain's Island, and the11 crossed the Sound to Sea Oliff i11 Hempstead Harbor and closced the gap in the survey between the line Captain's Island-Oak Neck, the eastern limit, and the line Prospect Point-Whortleberry Island, the western limit, inclulliug Hempstead Bay.

Ba.lf.-80011 after the miutlle of April, 1885, instructions were issued to AssLstant K P. Dickins to proceed to New York and make tl1e triangulation needed for the re8uney ur New York Bay and Harbor. He was dircctetl to concern himself first with the points· required for the resnrwy of the lower bay, an!l espechtUy those on the south side of Uoney Island and Ifockaway Heacb. He was to examine the condition of the old points with a view of recovering as many as practicable, re·estahlishing those that hail been lost, and supplementing additional points where necessary.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Mr. Hergesheimer's field-wotk during the previous winter on the Gulf coast is reported under the heading of Section VI. Topographic resurvey of the shores of the North River, New York.-Early in June, 1885, Assistant D. B. Wainwright was directed to proceed to New York and take up the topographical survey of the shores of Nortll River, from Rf'd Hook and Gaven's Point to Fifty-ninth street and the opposite shore. The immediate oqjed of this work was to supply positions and shore-line needed by the hydrograpbic parties. Mr. V\-ainwrigbt was instructed also to confer with Assistant E. Hergcsheimcr in regard to obtaining and using data from the municipal authorities of New York and of the towns on the New Jersey shore, availing himself of all necessary shore-line within their control, but always lletermining the position of salient points by the plane-table. In pursuance of these instructions, and to meet the wants of the hydrographic survey, he began by determiniug all prominent buildings and objects suitable for signals from the Battery tu Fourteenth street on the New York side, and from Communipaw to Castle Stevens on the New .Jersey side. Points on the upper topogrnpliic sheet were then, determined on the New Yorl:" shore and opposite from Fourteenth street to Eighty-third street. Tracings showing position of signals determiued were furnished to the bydrograpbic parties. Mr. "\Yainwright then began the work of delineating the shore-line on the New York side, and by the close of the fiscal year had complete<l the field survey from Fourteenth street to Sixty-fifth street. He fou11d it advisable to extentl the work somewhat beyond the as:signed limits iu order to include the new ancl very large docks of the New York Central Hail way, which are also the last of any importauee ou the New York side. Preparations were then made to take np the shore-line survey on the New York side from Castle Point to Weehawken l<'erry. Further ruention of Mr. Wainwright's progress is necessarily deferred to the next annual report. His serTices in the earlier part of the fiscal year are referred to under the heilding of Section III. Hydrographic resurvey of the .lforth River, New rork.-That portion of the hydrographic resurvey of New York Bay and Harbor included in the North River and its approaches, was assigued in May, 1885, to Lieut. William G. Cutler, U.S. N., Assistant Uoast and Geodetic Surve_y, commanding the schooner Palinurus. Lieutenant Cutler began soundil1gs May 2.3, and between that date arul .June 30 had finished the restu\·e.r of the Nort.h Hi\'er, with tile exception of the wl!arf-lines from Castle Garden to 'V eehawken l~erry. The hydrographic projections furnished t-0 Lieutenant Cutler for his work were upon a scale of 1--5000. A more detailed account of thii; slll'vey will appear in the next annual report. Ensigns E. E. Wright and A.G. Rogers, U.S. N., were attached to the Palinurus. Mention has been made under a previous headi11g in this section of the hydrography execute(] by Lieutenant Outler on the north shore of Long Isla11d Soaml, l>etween Hammonas1mtt Point and \Velch's or Cedar Point. lJei·ewpment of plans for the study of the physical hydrography of New York Bay and Harbor.Need of special examinations to a.secrtain the physical history of the cha-ngesin 1llono1noy Slwals.-As soon as practicable after the appropriation for the resurvey of New York Bay and Harbor became available, Assistant Henr,y Mitchell was directed to reopen the study of the pl1~'sics of the harl>or, and supervise the further collect.ion of data for the purpose of ascertaining the laws of action of its tides and currents. Assistant H. L. Mariudin was at the same time instructed to organize a field party with such subdivisions as l\Ir. Mitchell mi~ht advise, and authority was gh·en to procure bJ- transfer from the service of the Mississippi Hiver Commission two traiued experts in river gauging. 'l'o Mr. Marindin's party Assistant Marcus Baker was assigned, his instructions, dated May 28, 1885, directing him to proceed to Boston and report to Mr. Mit-chell for general conference and-consultation in conjunction with Mr. MarincUn. At the date at which this report closes, two parties ba(l been organized for the hydrological survey, one in the schooner Drift, under the command of Lieut. F. S. Carter, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, all(l the other in the ischooner Scoresby, Assistant Marcus Baker commamiing. Their work was to ascertain what are the functions of the different bays -and rivers emptying into New York Harhol' in maintaining the depths over Sandy Hook Bar. 1\Ir. l\1itcl1ell has indicated the following physical questions as among the IJ\Q~~ im_\)Ortant, per·

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

haps, that have remained unsolved with regard to the projects of encroachment iu different parts of the harbor: (1) In what relative proportions do the two entrances of tlie harbor supply its tidal volume! (2) In what relative proportions do the two entrances to the harbor dischar~e the river waten·, and how do these proportions differ with floods and low stages of the Hudson! (3) To what depth, if limited, does the influence of tl.Je river water extend, aud how doe8 this deptl1 vary with amount of river discharge~ (4) To what extent is the Hudson River a tidal reservoir as affecting New York Harbor; i.e., at what distance above New York would au exclusion of tlle tide reduce the flow througl.J the harbor below, at the period of least fresh-water discharge' (5) What is the ph;ysica] value of Newark Ila;y as a tidal reserYoir tributary to New York Harbor! With regard to t.his important harbor, Mr. 1\fit-Ohell remarks that tlrn former physical surYey cannot be repeated to advautage except by au expenditure of time and money that will make it practicable to occupy a number of points simnltaneonsly, so that the work will faithfully reflect all that goes OH iu the great, channels at the same instant of time. Jfon011w11 Shoals.- Yers serious apprehensions are felt relath'e to the ilwrease of obstrnctimrn at the eastern entrance to Nantucket Sound, and great difficult,v has been experienced in keeping Urn chart correct, Nlpeciall,v as regards the sailing lines. The Increase of tile shoals and their movements have been pretty well connrcted with the rapid degradation of the shores of Cape Cml, at and above Chatham, so that it is almost certain that some mo\Tements of' the sea, uot yet. properly gauged, must account for both the destructive and constmcti ve phenomena obsenTed. Although glacial cliffs along the coast are everywhere gi\'ing way before the dash of the Rea, the destruction is not rapid, exce11t where there rum; in some ocean current (tidal or otherwise) to carry off the tlf\hris as fast as· it falls into the sea. Oue obsen·es from a comparison of ancieut aml modern charts, and even from repeated sur\Te;)'S in our own time, that the submerged c011tours near the elbow of Cape Uod fall Lack some.what as the coast recedei<, and the Mouomoy Shoahi increase as they move to the southwestward. This movement of the shoals has reduced the wi1lth of t.l1e channt'l known as "Butler's Hole" to one-half its former width, aml has show11 across the great. south cl1auut'l "lumps" of 1leposit, which render the deep track tortuous and dangerous. In liis annual report., Mr. Mitchell recommends that the physical histor,v of these' clianges ht.\ ascertained, not on1,y by comparing ancient and modern maps and surn1~·s, but by observing- tit(' w:tves and currents till the dynamic scheme is plai11ly trong!Jt out. It may be that 110 remedy for the deterioration is possible, but until a dia.gnosis of the eal'le has been mnde, 110 such verdict ca11 be declared against the interest of over twenty-five thousand yei;;;el>' tliatannuall~- pass this way. 2lfississipp·i River Co11111ii11sion.-'l'he surYey is repn·sente(l h:y .Mr. Mitchell npo11 the Mississip11i River Commission. Much of hi:s time is tlrns employed, lint 11ot to the l'Xclusion of other duties. His relation to the work of the Corn mission he makes a theme in his amrnal report, for the sake of recording his objection to the proposed high-water closure of the Atclmfalaya, on the ground, principally, of its increasing the velocity of the grea,t floods to an extent that would sometimes preveu t. vessels from towing up to New Orleans from the sea, shoultl the present riYer banks (and laud" adjacent of almost inca1cnlable value) bold against the wear of the main stream. Advisory Oommissfons.-Iu bis annual re.port, Mr. Mitchell, referring to atl,·isory commission::; in genera.I, says: "They are a body of experts who study the physical data and the generic wants of navigation. In recommending the harbor lines, those beyond which no one shall huild and to which building in a certain order shall be prosecuted, the advisory board does not recognize individual interests or e11t1wprises, although it fre<1uently happens that. the adjustment of rival interests turns upon itf! decisions. It is usually the function of the local commission to have hearings of parties in interest, and settle disputes-, but an appeal is m~ule to the aclviso1y eonunission in all cases where decisions may rest npou physical data. The particular value of the advisory commission appears when two ri.val interests, both disposed to be fair, but each jealous of the other, fin<J themselves confronted by a physical reason, a re&1on based upon the natural laws of the tides, currents, or cross-sections. I have so often seen cases settled in this way that I have

come to thiuk a physical reason tlie best reason, because recognized as higher law. One may eai;ily sec that rival claimants for water space on opposite !'hores of a river caunot be equally entitled, because the river flo"· ii; not the same o~ the two shores, and encroachment from one shore must disturb it more than from the other. In very many ways such inequalities pn~seut themselves, and the party losing discovers that his best intere8ts lie in gracefully and promptly yielding to a reason which the comlllunity is ready to adopt." Special reports lHn-e ueen presented by Mr. Mitchell res11ectiug the necessity of a light-house upon George's Shoal, and upon the changes in extent and location of the shoals in Delaware Bay. Later, under the heading of this section, is given a resume of the work of Assistants Mitchell and "M"arindin with reference to the adjustIDent and solution of important practical qnestio11s affecting the navigation of Delaware Bay and Hfrer, and the respectiYe limits of jurisdiction of the States of New Jersey and Delaware over the waterH of the river and ba;\·· Records of ob8ervantions with self-registering tide·gaugts at (/01,ernor'11 Island and at Sandy Hook.-Early in May, 1885, au automatic tide-gan1rn was establisl1t'd on the wharf at Goveruor'8 Island, Xew York Harbor, to he used iu connection with the hydrogrnpltic resurvey of the harbo1· and bay. This gauge will haw the supervision of the narnl officers in charge of the hydrographic pa,rties in that vicinity. 1'he records from the self-registering gauge which was maintained at the same location on Govemor's Island for upwards of 1;ixtee11 years, ending in 1879, ,yielded valuable data for the study of the tides of New York ent.rance. The automatic tide-gauge at Sa1ifl.Y Hook, New Jer::;P_y, wliich l1as been kept in operation with comparath·ely few interruplious for several ye<trs, in charge of l\lr. I<'. vV.

Shepheard hiwing resigue(l. Towards the eud of March 1\fr. J. "\V. CorlJett was placed in charge, and reconls lrnve been received since the close of that month. Topographical res1trrey of San(l,IJ Hook, New J cr.~cy.-Chauges iu tb e shore-line of Sandy Hook and of the hydrography in its Yicinity, as affecting the m:liu ship channel abreast of the Hook, have called for much study, based upon careful resurveys, to ascertain the laws governing these changes, and to determine their extent and influence. In connection with the resurvey of New York Bay and Harbor, a topographical resurrn.r of the Hook was deemed essential, and early in Jnue, 1885, this work was assigned to Mr. E. h Taney, an aid in the Survey of triml ability as· a topographer. )lr. 'fm1e~··organized his party and arrived at the Hook .June 16, and at the elate at which this report closes was actively at work. Further mention of bis progress will be made in the next annual report . .E.x:tension of reconnais8anoe and triangulation in tlie southern pa.rt of the Sfa.te of New Jersey.As stated in my last annual report, geodetic operations in the southern IJart of the State of New Jersey were resumed by Prof. E. A. Bowser, acting assistant, at as early a date as practicable in the spring of 1884. At the beginning of the fiscal year Professor Bowser ha(l selected a snfficie11t number of1>0ints to the west and southwest of vVilliamstown, Gloucester County; to close the ho· rizon around that station. The country being mostly flat, and in many places heavily wooded, signals ranging in height from forty to upwards of one hundred feet had to be erected to make the reconnaissance successful. On July 7 the occupation of stations of the triangulation was begun, additional reconnaissance having bt>,en postponed till later- in tlie season. Station A pplepie Hill, about five miles west of the town of Shamong, Burlington County, was first occu1>ied. Five primary points were observed upon from this station, the point farthest t-0 the east beiug Ridgeway, distant from the Atlantic coast a little over seven miles, aud the most western point, Berlin, beiug within twelve miles of the Delaware River. Upon the completion of observations at Applepie Hill, August 26, the old monument which had marked the station was placed five and a half foet below the surface of the ground, and a granite post of the usual dimensions for a surface mark was set in hydraulic cement, its top, upon which the center of the station had been marked, being within six inches of the surface. Berlin Station, near the town of that name, in Camden County, was next occupied, itlld on the

At the opening of the season in 1885 Professor Bowser was instructed to take the tield iu continuation of the reconnaissance and triangulation of the State. Extension of' reeonnais.Yance and triangulation in the ea~tern porti.on of tlic State <!f Pennsylt'ania.Up to the beginning of 1884, the geodetic operations carried on for some years precediug in the eastern and southeastern portions of the State of PenusylYa11ia ltatl dett·rmined accurately in geographical position thirteen stationR of the. tria11gnlation resting on the fixed primal')· liucs Jleeting· House-Priucipio ancl Newtown-Mount l~ose. A large number of subsidiary points hacl also heen determined, including church spi.res and prominent huildings. Through the liue Newtown-Mount Rose a connection had heen obtaint>d with the triiwgnlation of the State of New Jersey. Early in July, 188J, Prof. Mansfield Merriman, acting asRistant, was inRtructt'tl to orgauizt> a party for continuing the triangulation aml rnconnaissance, arnl lwga11 tiie occupation of statiou Swatara Ga11, alJunt eleYeu miles northwest of Lebanon, Lebauon Count~·. Heliotropers were posted at Wo111elsclorf, Round Top, an<l lJauphiu; a tower with signal was erected at White Horse, and a signal placed at Governor Dick. Hut few observations could be taken in July, the weather being foggy and rai11y. The line from Swatara (~ap to Hound Top, upwards of thirty-two miles long, led aeross the Yalle_y of the Snsqnehanna, a.ml ove.r the Steelton Iron Works, and no ineasnrements of its direction could be obtaiued until August, aud then at hut rare intervals. On account of these difficulties, the obsenations at Swatara Gap could not be completed till August 30, when the triangulation was closed, ancl the limited time remaining clevotecl to reconuaissance. Professor Merriman's first efforts were directed towai·d a revi11ion of tl1e location of stations weRt and southwest of the meridian of 770, so as to ohtain a fa\·orahle co1111<·ctio11 with the .Maryland triangulation through the stations .Fairview and Maryland Heigb ts. This was accomplished by selecting a ve1 y promiuent point, Mouut Misery, iu Mary lam:, about a mile Routh of the State line, and 2,300 feet elevation above tide. In Pennsykania this station co11nects with Piney Mount and Pulpit Rock. During part of August and in Octolier, Professor Merriman began a reconnai8sance along the meridian of 76° in the vicinity of Mauch Chunk, Carbon County, for tlie purpose of connecting the triangulation of Pennsylvania with that of New York. The reconnaissance was carried to within seven miles of Wilkes Barre, Luzerne County. Field-work was closed in October. In order to expedite this reconnaissance and allow more time to Professor Merriman for tbe triangulation during the two or three months of each year arnilable for his field operations, Assistant 0. H. Tittmann was directed in June, 1885, to continue it northward from points already estali. lished, so as to include in the trigonometric uetwork tlie coal fields of Luzerne County. He wa8 instructed also to determine wlrnther it was practicable, in the locality just mentioned, to develop the reconnaissance for the primary scheme incidentally to the work of fixing trigonometric points with sufficient accuracy for the collocation of local topographical State surveys on a general map. Professor Merriman was at the same time. directed to resume work upon the triangulation of Pennsylvania as early as practicable, and his C-O·O})eratiou with Assistant Tittmann was provided for . .A. statement of the results reached by the labors of these gelltlemen is necessarily deferred. to the next an·nual report.

Reconnaissance for triangulation in tlte u:estern ]iaif of the State of Pennsylvanla..-Towards the close of the fiscal ;year, the appointment of Prof. L. II. llamanl as acting assistant was renewed and he was charged with tbe conduct and execution of the work of triangulation in the weHtern half of' the State of l'ennsylvauia. He was directed to lwgin by makiug a reconnaissance of precision connecting two points on the Tnssay Mountain, or on Broad 'l'op, with points already determined in the vicinity of J,ancastcr an<l llarrisburg. l'rofessor Barnard vi;.;ited Washington, and after having informed himself' thoroughly of the conditions and limitations of the work in conference with the Superintendent., conferred also witl1 Dr. Charles A. Ashburner, geologist in charge of' the anthracite coal fields of the State, in referunce to the 01wrations desired by th(! State Geological Survey. An accmmt of his progress will · find a place in the next amrnal re11ort. Special tr,innr11tlationfor the city of I'hilatlelphia.-A request having been made by Mr. Samuel J,. Smedley, Chief Engineer and Snrveyor, in behalf of tl1e authorities of the city of Pbilade.lpllia, for the trigonometric determination of it number of points iu and around tlie city, Assistant S. C. McCorkle was directetl to execute tliis work after conference with Mr. Smedley, aud began the 11reliminary reconnaissance towards the eml of November. Other duties iutcrfere<1 to imwent the completion of' the reconnaissance by Mr. McCorkle, a11d early in January, 1885, Subassistaut C. H. Van Ordeu was directed to report to him. By the end of that mouth Mr. Van Orden bad finished. the reconnaissance, erected five signals, and occupied four stations. Exposure to wind and cold at a station on tbe roof of Girard Oolleg~ .January BI brought on an attack of' ill11ess, which for a time completely prostrated Mr. Van Orden and compelled his relief from field duty. Some delay was thus o~casioned, bnt towards the end of Felmmry Assistant C. H. Sinclair w:iR orclered to take up the work under Mr. :McCorkle's direction, and h~· the end of March lw tinisbetl it. During its progress the tower of the new Cit.Y Hall, which bad tlwu n'ached an rle\·atiou of one hundred and ninety-two foet, was occupied as a station. The statistics of the work are:

It remained to connect this local triangulation with the 1n'imar.r series, and for this duty Mr. Van Orden, whose health liad been restored, wag directed in April, 1885, to report to Mr. McCorkJe. The line Mount Holly-Girard College was at first proposed aR tbfl desired base, but finding it practicable only by ex1iensive openi11g of lines, tl1e line l'ine Hill-Girard College was snbstitute<l. This line, in counection with the station at Bellevue Hotel, Red Bank, N. J ., presented a satisfactory solution of the problem. The stations at Uirard College and Bellevue Hotel were reoccupied for the measurement of additional angles in order to give greater weight to observations previously made. In all fourteen angles were measured and five points determilll.ld iu positions by three hundred and twenty-four observations. The results of this work and of that before referred to have been communicated to the city Chief Engineer. In the annual report for 1879 mention was made of an examination of the movement of ice in the Delaware, conducted by Mr. McOorkle along the stretch of river from Bridesburg, above the city, to Fort Miftlin, below it. Similar examinations were made, in pursuance of instructions, by Mr. McOorkle during the winter of 1884-1885, which is saicl to have been one of tile most severe known there for forty years. The ice was found to be unusually heavy, notably below the Horseshoe. The largest accumulations of ice were found at the Narrows, between Gloucester and Greenwich Poinhl, in the bend at the Horseshoe, and below Fort Miffiin. Mr. McOorkle has submitted a full report of the results of bis observations, accom1lanied by illustrative maps, and the recommendations be makes will IJe of interest to the Uuited States advisory commission on the improvement of the Delaware River. Phvsical hydrography of Delau:are River and Bay.-The studies of the physical bydrography of Delaware River and Bay, especially those bearing upon the changes in the extent and looation of the shoals, have been continued by Assistants Henry Mitchell and H. L. Marindin. Mr. Mitchell bas submitted a report which refiects fairly the aspoot of his work, a.ad in which

he refers to an important practical conclusiou, drawn from bis study of the river an<l bay, and which settled a question of jurisdiction between the States of New Jersey and Delaware, and between these two States and the General Government. Some extracts from this report are as follows : " Quite beyond the jurisdiction of the Harbor Commission of l~biladelphia or its a<l visers, we have been making a study of the changes in the extent and location of the shoals. My own part has been inquiries into the general laws of sectional areas, in which I have been assisted, fortunately1 by Mr .·T. A. Sullivan, upou whom most of the work llas fallen. Appendix 8, Report for 1383, established certain laws of depth and surface widtll, aud gave rise to the question: Is the surface width a proper criterion; should it not be the mean chord, or perllaps tlle chord of mean depth! A computation of mean chord was clearly out of the question, but Mr. Sulli\·an undertook the computation of the chord of mean depth, and I insert his table, with illustrati,·e diagrams,· on which we are not yet prepared to ofter conclusions. I want,, however, to record one tllought about the mean section that may prevent its misleading; it is this: Since for these forty-six miles right hand and left band turns enter the mean section, it cannot be a characteristic natural sectiou, but must be nodal. , "In the appendix to tlle report for 1883, referred to above, I took some pains to call attention to very important practical conclusions from a study which migllt otlierwise have appeared speculative. At that time I did not dream tllat this study would come to have political valrn',, !Jut it appears from the report of Hon. John P. Stockton, Attorney-General for New Jersey, and from the letter of Hon. Jolin H. Paynter, Attorney-Geueral of Delaware, that a question of jurisdiction between these two States, and between these States and the General Go.-ernment, is likely·to be settled to the satisfaction of all parties upon the basis of our solution of a pLysical problem. .And here I must repeat what I said in a former report wllen commending ad,·isory harbor commissions, that a physical reason is tbe best reason because the higher law." A brief statement of the question of jurisdiction referred to by Mr. Mitchell will be in place liere. Citizens of the State of New Jersey bad claimed and exercised the rigl1t of fishing in the river Delaware. This claim had been resisted by the State of Delaware, and the boats and net~ of the New Jersey fishermen had been seized by Dela.ware on the charge of violating the statute laws of that State by fishing within its limits. This had been done notwithstanding the fact that an injunction of the Supreme Court .of the United States bad been issued forbidding such action hy tlie State of Delaware, the authorities of that State claiming that their statute laws bad been \'iolated because the fishing was done within the limits of l>elawaI'e in Delaware Bay, and not within the area covered by the injunction of the Supreme Court, wl1icl1 applied only to the river. It became important, therefore, to define the territorial limits over which the injunction operated, or, in otller words, to ascertain the dividing line between the riYer and h:-iy. The GoYernors of the two States interested haviug referred this question to their respective .Attorneys-General for settlement, it was agreed by these officers to accept the decision of the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Tlle couclusion reached by the Superintendent, and confirmed b~· .Assistant Mitchen, was that the dividing line was properly one from Bombay Hook Point to Cohanisey light, a. conclusion which, in view of the large interests involved iu the controversy, atteists the practical value of studies not unfrequently classed as purely speculative. Assistant Mitchell refers to a report prepared by Assistant :Marindiu 011 a comparison of the changes in th~ transYerse sections of the Delaware River between Old Navy-Yard and the east l'lltl of Petty's Island, as shown by the surveys of 1819, 1843, and 1878. This report, with illustratirn diagrams, appears in .Appendix No. 12. Reference was made in the last annual report to Mr. Marindin'is assignment to duty as Consulting Engineer of the United States Advisory Commission for port-warden lines for the harbor of Pbiladelpbia. Until about the middle of October Mr. Mariudin was occupied ou the con1parisom1 of surveys; he then received a call from the chairman of the .Ad,·isory Commission, and after prepari11g the port-warden lines for discussion, be.attended a meeting of the Commission in December. lo the early part of January be was directed to collect some data with a view of showing the importance of marking George's Shoals; on this subject he made a special report to Mr. Mitchell, who wa8 then engaged on that inquiry. Subsequentl;y lie was order<>d to proceed t.o Washington H. Ex.18--5

for conference with the Superintendent, aud then to l'hiladdphia to take charge of a 11ydrographic and topographic sul'Ye,Y of the Delaware Hiver above Bridesburg. He was, however, soon relieved from this qnty and directed to prepare for work in connection with the resurvey of New York Bay and Harbor. Mention of this has already been made under a preceding beading in this report. Upon the Commission advisory to the Ilarbor Commission of' Philadelphia, the Survey is repre· sented also by Mr. Mitchell, to whom was tendered recently the chairmanship, But he deemed it best to deeline the positiou, as it seemed to him that either of his two associates might more pro11erly preside, both beiug i11 charge of pnblic works in the neighborhood. Capt. George E. White, U.S. N., was accordingly elected. The third member is Col. Henry M. Robert, United States Engineers. Towards the latter part of June, 1885, Mr. :M arindin was informed that he had beeu elected secretary of the board. Special triang1dation. Delaware River from Petty's Island to Poquessink Creek.-An extension of the survey of the Delaware River from Petty's Island to Poquessiuk Creek, the northeastern boundary of tiie city, having been requested by the city authorities, Assistant I<'. W. Perkins was directed to proceed to Philadelphia and execute the work, after conference with Mr. Samuel H. 8medley, Chief Engineer of tile city. Mr. Perkins began a reconnaissance of the ground to be covered early in November, and by the 20th of that month was able to begin observations. Progress being slow, owing to bad atmos· pberic conditions, Subassistant Van Orden was ordered to report to Mr. Perkins soon after the beginning of December, aud with his energetic aid fielrl work was finished by the end of the year. The triangulation determined all the points needed for a topographical and hydrographical survey of the most detailed nature. Following are tlie statistics: Number of points occupied .. __ ...... _... _. . . .... _.. ___ .... _.. __ .... _. - . . 13 Number of positions determined . . . . ... _......·. _. _.... __ ... _.. _. . . . . . _. 53 Number of observations made .... _.. _. _____ . _.. _..... _........ _...... _ . . 3, 318 Assistant 1>erkius expresses his obligations to Chief Engineer Smedley for many courtesies aml liberal facilities in the execution of tlle work, aud to Mr. George S. Webster, surveyor of the tenth district, for mud1 valuable assistance and information. Otbe1· duty assigned to Mr. Perkins is mentioned under the- heads of Sections I and VIII. Magnetic observations at Pltiladelpkia.-To meet a. request made by the Committee of the International Electric Exhibition at Pl1iladelphia, <ind for the imrpose of following up the secular change in terrestrial magnetism, Assistant Edwin Smith was directed in August, 1884, to determi11e the magnetic l1orizontal intensity and the dip at tl1e building for electric tests on each of' three days, the Rpecial locality to be selected after consultation with Prof. H.B. Snyder, of the Franklin Institute. He was instructed also to reoccupy the old magnetic station of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at Girard College, and to make there the usual three days' observations for declination, dip, and intensity. .After observing· five sets of oscillations at the magnetic station on Capitol Bill, Mr. Smith proeeeded to Philadelphia, and upon the completion of the necessary arrangements with l"rofessor Snyder, took seven Rets of oscillations and three sets of dip at the test laboratory of the exhibition on August 29, 30, and :Jl. It was found that at Girard College a uew station would have to be selected, the 11ositions of the ol<l stations being either covered witll buildings or too near them to admit of obtaining results free from abnormal disturbances. At the station occupied, which was in the grounds and near the one of 1877, complete sets of obseryation for declination, dip, and horizontal intensity were made on September 3, 10, and 11. The true meridian was determined by four sets of observations on the sun. The instruments usecl were the same as tboM in use for many years past by Assistant Schott at the station on Capitol Hill: Magnetometer No. 7 and Casella dip circle No. 4440. On returning to Washington, Mr. Smith observed three sets of oscillations at the Capitol Hill station . .All of' the records and field computations of this work have been deposited in the office.

Other :field duty assigned to Assistant Smith will be referred to uude,r the headings of Sections VIII, IX, and XV. ]Jet,ermination of tlte position of a wreck off Barncgo.t.-It having been reported to this office that the wreck of tbe steamei· Guadalupe, ashore off Barnegat, was in a position dangerous to navigation, I.ieut. Commander W. H. Brownson, U.S. N.,.Assistant O(last and Geodetic Survey, was instructed to determine its position. Ile dispatched Ensign M. C. Gorgas, U. S. N., witli orders to take the necessary measurements, and to board the wreck if practieahle. By angles taken from shore stations, the position of the sunken steamer was referred to Barnegat light-liouse, but on account of heavy breakers Mr. Gorgas was unable to boanl th..., wreck or enm get near it. As it appeared probable that the vessel would soon be broken np by the action of the sea, it was not deemed advisable to issue a Notice to Mariners. Lieutenant-Commander Brownson reports that Ensign Gorgas carried ont his instructions with zeal and intelligence under difficulties, owing to a beavy gale of wind which prerniled while cro1>s· ing Barnegat Inlet and at the Light. The work was done late in Xornmuer: Continuation of tr,iang1dation a1id reconnaissance on the Xew ,Jer8ey coaxt. JJ.1 agnetie xta,tion occupied on that eoa,yt, and topographic sur1'&)! con.tinued.-At the beginning of tl1e fiscal year, Assistant Charles M. Bache was in the field on the coast of New ,Jersey, near Townsend's Inlet, under instructiom'I to carry a small triangulation for the purposes of a topographical survey from that Inlet to Absecon light at Atlantic City. Subassistaut J.B. Baylor was attached to his J)artJ during part of the season. He aided in tile triangulatiou, aud tlctermined the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity at a station near Sea Isle CitJ·, on I,udlam's BPa<:h. Begiuning with the base-line Tatham-Public, near Townsend's Inlet, Mr. Bache carried the triangulation to Absecon light, a distance of nearly twenty-seven miles, by Octouer lLJ. Each sta· tion of tbe seventeen triangles laid out was occupied, and each angle measured by four series of observations of six: repetitions each. The stations were for the most part on the edge of the fast land of the coast and inside the sand hills of the beach. Each station was secnn>d by a sub-1mrface center-mark of 7-iuc11 gaspipe driven into the ground. Mr. Bache mentions that a railroad, without break except at Egg Harbor Inlet, has heen constr11cted and is now in running order from Townsend's Inlet to Absecon Inlet, following the beach. Mr. Baylor was relieved from duty in the party, October 1. His sen·ices are n·ferred to in terms of high appreciation by Mr. Bache. At the close of the season the barge Beauty, which bacl served as a floating camp for the party, was laid up at Sea Isle City. During the winter, Assistant Bache completed tbe field computations and records of bis triangulation, and at the opening of the season, in 1885, was directed t<> organize a party as soon as practicable and resume the topogr~phical resurvey of the New Jersey coast. Thi.s work be began a little to the south west of Townsend's Inlet, and at the end of the fiscal year he was steadily prosecuting it northeastwardly toward .Atlantic City.

1'opographical resurvey of the New Jersey slwt·e of Delaioare Bay continued.-At as early a <late after the beginning (Jfthe fiscal year as the appropriation wonhl permit, iustruetions were issue\l to Assistant R. M. Bache to resume topographical work on the east sllore of Delaware Bay. 'l'bc two projections, on a. sea.le of 1-20000, famished to Mr. Bache included tlie shore-line of the ba.v from the Hummocks, ab(Jut two miles south of the mouth of Goshen Creek, to Fortescue Creek. Baek of the l.'lbore-line the distance included ill the 1mrvey varied from a mile to a mile and a half. The width of the belt wa.s determined with reference to three cmnsi<lerations-first, the general symmetry of the circumscribed a.rea, regarded longitudinally in view ot' the very great curvature of the shore; second, the exhibition within that area of the relation to ea.ch other of tl1e intersect-

ing river and creeks; and, third, the representation within reasonable limits of the points of fast-land protruding into the wild marsh, thereby completing with other elements the characteristics of the groand. The first sheet, extending from the Hummocks to Egg Island light, was finished; the second, from Egg Island light to Fortescue Beach, was not completed when ortlers were recefred Nornmber 10 to discontinue work for the season. Mr. E. L. Taney serwil as aid in the party, to the entire satisfaction of l1is chief. During the winter l\fr. Bache finisl1e<l the inking of his topographical work, and early in June 1885, resumed field operationR under insLructions to take up the survey at the limit of work of the preceding season. At the close of the fiscal year he was at Nantuxent Creek, having delineated six miles of shore-line with a belt of interior topography of the average width.

Completion of the topngraphical resurvey of the western shore of Delaware Bay.-At the opening of the fiscal year there remained on the western shore of Delaware Bay, to complete the topographical resurvey which bad been in progress since 1880, a strip of topography about sixteen miles in length, extending from Clarke's Point Station, four miles north of Mispillion light-house, to Broad.kill Creek, and about one mile, on the average, in width. This work was taken up by Assistant C. T. Iardella, in pursuance of inRtrnctions dated July 12, ISM, and was finished October 31. With regard to Mispilliou Creek, Mr. Iardella observes that it is about one hundred and fifty meters (four hundred and ninety-two feet) wide at its entrance. Vessels drawing six feet can enter at very high tide, and after getting abreast of the lighthouse, ten to fifteen feet can be carried at low water from the light-hot'lse to Milford, a distance of twenty-one mi1es. In some places the creek is two hundred meters (six hundred and fifty-six feet) wide. A shoal, nearly bare at low water, obstructs the entrance ; eight or nine vessels have been seen at anchor for nearly a week, waiting for fair wind and high tide, to get over the shoal. Just below the entrance of Mispillion Creek there is a wide ditch, some two miles long, which connects with Old Cedar Creek. This creek, from its entrance to the ditch or canal, is filled up. Small vessels drawing five feet can pass through the canal, and after reaching the creek the water deepens for a short distance. Slaughter Creek is entirely filled up at its entrance, and navigation is entirely suspended. At the entrance a shoal has bP.en formed which for about two hundred meters is entirely bare at low tide.

Oootinuation of the hydrograpkic resurcey of Delm~are Bay and entrance.-As early in July, 1884, as the appropriation became available, Lieut. G. C. Hanus, TT. S. N., .Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was instructed to organize his party on hoard tbe steamer Endeavor, and continue the hydrography of lower Delaware Ba.y and entrance. For this purpose he was famished with four projections, three of which were laid out upon a scale of 1-20000, and included areas of hydrographic work extending from tbe eastern and western shores of the bay north of Cape May light and Mispillion light to the main ship-channel; the fourth, on a scale of 1-40000, included hydrography in less detail between Capes May and Henlopen and off the entrance to the bay.

Great care was taken to eRtahliRh a sufficient number of' tide-gauges to obtain accurate planes of' reference for the reduction of soundings. Box and staff gauges were fixed at the steamboat wba.rf', Cape May Point, aud referred to a bench-mark on the beach. A box-gauge was established in the vicinity of Maurice Rh·er light-house, and referred to a bench-mark on the foundation wall of the building. FiYe gauges were set up nf'ar H nt Station, six miles nearly northwest of Mispillion light. These gauges were all compart>d with eacl1 other by Rirnultaneons obsen·ations to guard against mishap in case of storms. They we-re alf'\o compared with tl1e gauge at the TTnited States iron pier on the Delaware Breakwater, clay and niglit tides being observed at both places for se\·eral days. Lieutenant Hanns, in bis report of the season's work, gives fall details in regard to the locality of the several gaugps established, and the methods followed in obtaining comparisons of readings. With reference to the mode of planting water signals devised h.Y himself two ,years ago, and dt>scribed on page 34 of the Report. of 1883, be obserYes that a large number of these were used i11 the hydrographic work, and that a long· tree, large at the base, was found to be better than a signal made of seantling. Oue of these trees, forty feet in length, was planted in fifteen feet of water. These tree pump-signals withstood every gale that occnrrt>d during the season . . Ensigns A. L. Hall, .J. H. Hetherington, E. F. Leiper, and G. R. French, U. S. N., were attached to the party. Soundings were completed according to the scheme of operations, Nm·ernher 12, and about a week later Lieutenant Hanus took the Endeavor to Norfolk to prepare for work ou the Sontlwm coast.

Gravity determination.~ mid experimental researchex at Washington, /). U., and in l'irginia.-Jnstructions issued to Assistant Charles S. Peirce in Jul_y, 1884, directed 11im to procc£'d to Fortress Monroe, Virginia, to determiu_e gravity there, and subsequentlj to reconnoiter for ouc or two sta· tions suitable for gravity determinations in the mountain region of Virginia, "\Vest Virginia, aud North Carolina. Mr. Peirce was occnpiell at Fortress Monroe till about September 1 in dctermiuing the intensity of gravity. He had some difficult~· in finding a suitable casemate in which to swing bis pendulum, Peirce No. 3. Finally, after making some experiments with the noddy to determine the amplitude of swaying of the pendnlmn support (see Appendix No. 15, Report for 188<l), he swung the pendulum heavy end up and l1eavy end down on alternate J·a~·s until an ample number of oscillations had beeu secured in both positions. With reference to these observations Mr. Peirce remarks, ''Peirce No. 3 bas therefore been swung in a particularly satisfactory manner, and I consider it unnecessary to swing another pendulum here, owing to the fact of this pe111lulum being reversible as well as invariable. The results here will be quite as good as at Allegheny." In September Mr. Peirce reconnoitered for a gra\'ity station in the mountains of Virgiuia; but no station could he found which would meet the views of the Superintendent as to elevation above the l!ICa-level and at the same time not 'be too expensive to occupy. On returning to Washington Mr. Peirce was appointed, October I, to the charge of the Office of Weights and Measurei,;. The duties of this position be fulfilled till Februar~- 22, when be declined further service. During this time, under instructiops1 be carried through an elaborate occupation of the injtia.l

gravity station at the Smithsonian Institution with four reversible pendulums-" Peirce Nos. 1, 2, 3 1 and 4." In November he was directed to attend the meeting at Newport of the National Academy of Sciences, of which body he is a member, and to present there a memoir upon the gravitation and other surveys. Also to attend the December meeting of the American Metrological Sooiety aml read a memoir upon the determination of gravity. This memoir will be printed by the society. During the winter, under instructions from the Superintendent, Mr. Peirce proceeded to Boston, Prodtleuce, Hartford, New York, and Philadelphia, and conferred with the manufacturers of gauges and machiuery, aud also with electricians and others with reference to the resolutions passed by the Unite<l States Electrical Conference concerning weights and measures, and t11e best way of meeting the wants of the country. In January, 1885, he was summoned before the Congressioual Commission and testified on the subject. Towards the end of .February, instructions were gh·en to Mr. Peirce to proceed to Key West and make gravity determinations there. Mention of his operations iu that locality will be made under the heading of Section VI. Annual determination of the magnetic iieclination1 iiip, and intensity at the station on Oap,itol Hill, lVa.shington.-In order to determine the annual effect of the secular eh ange in the magnetic elem en ts, observations for magnetic declination, dip, and intensity have been made at least once a year during the past thirtr :years at a magnetic station upon Capitol Hill, Washington, D. C. During that period, the declinatiou has increased gradually from 20 24' W. of N. to 40 12'. Assistant ()harles A. Schott, by whom or under whm;e direction the obserrn.tions have been made, observed on June 13 and 151 1885. The secular variation of the magnetic declination in the United States and at some foreign stations was discussed by Mr. Schott in a paper published as Appendix No.12 to the Report for 1882. In this Report will appear (Appendix No. 6) Mr. Schott's discussion of the secular variation of the magnetic dip and intensity, based upon observations made within the United States from tbe earliest to tbe present time. Continuation of tlte detailed topographiaal survey of the District of Oolwnbfo.-Favorable progress has been made in the rletailed topographical survey of the District of Columbia during the nine months spent by the party of Assistant J. W. Donn in field-work. This survey, made at the request of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, and carried on since February, 1881, under their general direction, has for its main. object, to quote a recen.t report of the Engineer Oommissioner: the Rupplying "of data for laying out new, and extending old, roads, and for prop· erly subdividing county property as it is laid out iu suburban streets and lots. "But its minute accuracy will make it useful for all time in planning public works of every description. It saved the necessity for the preliminary sun·eys in connection with the extension of the water-works now in progress-, and it will accomplish the same purpose wheu the city sewerage has to be extended into the country. From the maps of this survt'>r, so far as completed, and from such other data as were available, was compiled during the la.st year a new map of the entire District on a scale of four inches to the mile, to take the place of the Bosch ke map of 1855, of which the edition was uhausted, and which, in spite of many errorR, was the only topographical map of the District in existence. The new map was handsomely lithographed and printed in four colors by Bien & Co., of New York. "In connection with this survey, during the past season the four corner monuments of the District, as established by Ellicott in 1791, were identified an{l looa.Wd. It was discovered that the District is not exactly -a ten-mile square, the length of the four sides being as follows: "Southwest 53,031.3 feet, or 231.3 feet too long. " Southeast 52,871.3 feet, or 71.3 feet too long. "Northwest 52,863.6 feet, or 63.6 feet too long. "Northeast 53,063.8 feet, or 263.8 feet too long. "The total area of the original District was 100.6 square miles. The north point is 116.6 feet west of the meridian of the south point, and the east point is 138.6 feet south of the west p<>int. Considering the cl1aracter of the instruments with which ElJicott made his survey, and the nature of the country, tben practically a. wilderness, throllgh which he ran his lines, one cannot but be surprised at the accuracy of his results.

"From the data already furnished hy this 1mrn~y preliminary i1lans have heeu sketched out for the extension of the following avenues and streets through a portio11 uf the county, Yiz, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Jerisey, and Rhode Island avenues, Sixteenth street and L street. Other demands upon the District re,·enues make it impossible to attempt to carry these plans into effect at the present time; but the property-owners are recognizing the importance of having suburban property systematically laid out, and show a willingness to follow these plans iu the subdivision of their property. By so doing the city will be saved the expense in the future of rectifying irregular street lines in the suburban district at a coist far exceeding the expenditures for this survey, which are only $5,000 a year.'' At the beginning of the fiscal year the survey had been advanced to Blagden's mill, iu Rock Creek Valle~·, and tlience along the road leading to Brightwood, and up the Seventh street road to Silver Spring and the crossing of the northeastern boundary of the District. Westward of Rock Creek Valley the work was completed from Woodley Lane at Woodley Park to the northeastern boundary stone of the new Obsernttory site, thence across the western extremity of Georgetown Heights to the Distributing Reservoir and to the Potomac River. During the summer of 1°884 Mr. Donn worked west of the Seventh street road, north of the Blagden mill road, and across the Yalley of Rock Ureek above the crossing of the Militar_y road. Much of this area was occupied by a region verJ· difficult of access on account of heavy undergrowth. The surv1i;y was extended to the table-land lying between Rock Creek Valley and the valley of Broad Creek, and as far westward as it was possible to go during the season of foliage. '!'his northwest corner of the District presents some great difficulties to be overcome, in the shape of almost impenetrable thickets of spruce pine covering considerable areas. In November, after completing some work called for by the Commissioners, l~·ing to the eastward of the Metropolitan branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Mr. Donn transferred his suney to the country in and adjacent to the Foundry Branch Valley above Georgetown, embracing the Georgetown College grounds, and as far up the valley as Tnnlaw road. The several triangulation points established along the northwest boundary line of the District were occupied, and many points determined for the needs of the survey. During January and part of February the survey of Rock Creek Valley was completed from Blagden's mill to the crossing of the Military road, and during the latter part of February and March the valley lying immediately north of the grounds of the new Naval Observator~· was s1uve)'ed from the northeast corner of that property to the Tenallytown road. B.v tbe end of March, as there remained only enough of the appropriation to defraJ' the cost of completing suclt drawings aud plwtolitbographs as were required by the Commissioners, fieldwork was abandoned. In April Assistant D. B. Wainwright, who had rendered most efficient service in the party, was detached for other duty, reference to which has be('n made umler the he.ading of Section II. The prepamtio11 of sections of the survey for photolithographing wais coutinuti<l by Mr. J . .A. Flemer, the drimghtsuian of the party. Tracings from the oriJ.,,>inal sheets were pre· pared as needed by Mr. Dmm. On the 22d of June, a small surplus having been fonnd to be available, Mr. Donn took t.l1e field, and at. the close of the fiscal year was at work extending the topog1·aphy along W oodle;y Laue to itR junctiou with the Tenall.vtown road. Lines of lmitJl·ing oj"precision carried from Ashla.nd, Ya., t-0 Fortress Monroe; also a line to connect tl1e bench-mark near the W asltington A que<luct Bridge uitlt the Capitol bench-mark.-It was stated in the last annual re1·ort that tlle lines of leveling of precision in progress from Hagerstown, Md., towards li'ortress Monroe bad beeu carried at the close of the season itJ 1883 to a bench-mark estahlished on the Duncan Memorial Chapel at Randolph and Macon College, Ashland, Va. In pursuance of instructions issued in September, 1884, work on these lines was resumed by Assistant J.B. Weir, September 23. The Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad was followed as far as Richmond, Va. - In passing through that city, streets were selected for the route of the levels that were least used, and at times the .work was done early in the morning before any jar from heavy teamR was noticeable. From the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Pot-Omac Railroad the descent to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad was forty-three aud six-tenths meters (one hundred and forty-three feet),althougb. the horizontal distance passed over in the line of levels was only four and two·tenths kilometers, or two and six-tenths miles.

About threelrnndred meters (nine hundred and eighty-fourteet) from the depot of the Chesapeake and Ohi<> Railroad there is a tunnel, which is fourteen hundred meters (four thousand five hundred and uinety-tbree feet) long; and about eight hundred meters (two thousand six hundred and tweuty-fi,,e feet) from the eastern end of this tunnel is a high trestle of about the same length as the tunuel. The proximity of these two obstacles made it difficult to follow the line of the railroad, hut by taking a somewhat circuitous rou.te through streets and along the York Hiver Railroad Mr. Weir succeeded in going round both the tunnel and trestle with but little loss of time. A point was thus reached on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad at the eastern edge of the city, and the line of le\'els was continued tbence along the same road to Fortress Monroe without meeting auy serious obstacle. At Fortress Monroe the line of levels was connected with t_be IJeuch-mark on the light-house, this being tbe IJench to which the tide-gauge was referred during the period that tiual observations were made at that poiut. Connection was also wade with a bench-mark on the fort near the postern gate, and a permanent bench-mark ou the Soldiers' Home in Rampton. Full description15 of these bench-mark15 accompany the records and computations whicll baye heen trausmittell to the office. The fiehl computation will require to be cltecketl by the ollicecomputation before au accurate comparison can be made between the tidal len.1ls at Sandy Hook and Fortress .Monroe. After finishing the work just referred to, Mr. Weir, under instruction11, ran a line of levels to connect the bench-mark near the ·wasllingtou Aqueduct Bridge with the Capitol bench-marh:. Mr. John Nelson served as acting aid in the party vm·y acccptabl,v. Other lines of'leveling of precision run by Mr. \Veir during tbe spring of 1885 will be referred to nuder the heading of Section XIV. JJetermination of points on the boundary line between Maryland and Virginia.-Application having been made by the Governors of Maryland aud Virginia tor the detail of an officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, who sbould mark and determine in geographical position two points on the boundary line between their respecth·e States, in the presence of Mr. William J. A_ydelott, Com· missioner on the part of Mar,yland, and Mr. George H. Bagwell, Commissioner on the part of Vil, ginia, instructions were given NoYcmber 17, 1884, to Mr. Charles J unkeu, Acting Assistant, to meet the commissioners for the purpose just indicated. On December 1, the steamer Governor McLane, under command of Capt. H. Thompson, of the Maryland fishery force, was placed at the disposal of the Commissioners, and was retained hy them until the weather becinue so stormy aud inclement tllat they deemed it advisable to postpone the completion of the WOI'k till spring, only 1h-e working days haviug been obtained between Becem ber 1 and 23. The points to be marked were iD Pocomoke Sound, at a distance apart of two and a half miles (nautical), and in seven and tweh·e feet water, respectively. From three shore statiom1, known in position, Mr. Junkeu established two groups of permanent range marks, each group haYing two front signals and one rear signal; these signals were placed on the north shore of the sound, one group to the east, the other to the west of Apeshole Creek. By means of the rauge signals the places of tl1e twt> points 011 the boundary line were readily fouud, and marked temporarily with quarter inch iron pipe. Io Ma~· 1885, l\fr. Junken again met tl1e commissioners to completfl the work. At the mo~t southern point in the line, about two and a half miles (nautical) from the mouth of Broad Creek, he anchored a third-class can buoy iri eleven feet water, soft. bottom. The buoy was painted white, and was secured hy a second-class stone siuker with fifteen fathoms of chain." This was done on tbe 20ll1 of May, and on the same <lay a six-inch galvanized iron pipe thirty feet long, with steel dri\·ing-point, was snnk nineteen feet into the ground, in seven feet of water, at the more northern point. in the line, about a mile alld a half (nautical) west of the entrance to Pocomoke Rh·er. At this point the bottom is of soft mud, with a hard top-crust or sand and gravel of two feet in thickness. To the top of the pipe is secured a cap made of hoop-iron, forming a skeleton sphere f)t' Bixteen inches in diameter, with the letters "MD." "VA." attiached. · !<'or the front and rear range·signa]s underground marks were placed in position. Before returning to the office, Mr. Junken det.ermined trigonometrically the positions of

Hydrographic examinations off Cape Henry, Virginia.-TTpou the completion of hplrograpl1ic work in Long Island Sound, which has already been referred to under the heading of Section II, Ensign A. F ..Fechteler, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Snrrny, commanding the schooner Ueady, was directed to proceed to Cape Henry, Virginia, aud make an examination of the shoal upon which the U. S. S. Ossipee grounded. The souudiugs as gh·eu on the chart, he was to connect with the shore-line, and continue examinations south of the cape. This work was completed by Ensign Fetcheler about the middle of December, though only by great persistence in the midst of frequent iuterruptiorn; from stormy weather. No changes were found of sufficient importance to involve alterations upon the chart. Supplementary topographieal ,~urvey between Norfolk and the ocean skore.-Some details of topography yet remaining to be completed between Lynnhaven River, Virginia, and the sea-coast, in fur. therance of this work Assistant Eugene Ellicott was sent to Norfolk towards the end of November, 1884. The season proved unfavorable; cold, wet, aud stormy weather in December retarded field operations, and early in January the party was disbanded. Mr. Ellicott reports thirteen miles of roads surveyed, and an area of thirteen square miles. Mr. J. H. Gray was attached to the party as aid. Towards the en<l of' April, 1885, Mr. Ellicott resumed this work under instructions and completed it on the 19th of May. Other sun·eys made by Mr. Ellicott are referred to nuder the headings of Sectious I and VI. Extension of the primary triangulat-ion near the thirty-ninth parallel f1·om West Virginia into Kentucky an<l Oltio.-At tlrn beginning of the fiscal _year Assistant A. T. Mosman was in the field making the ueeded preparatious for exteuding the primary triangulation westward near the thirtyni11th parallel from the points previously occupied by him in \Vest Vir1eiuia. On the 16th of July, 1884, he established his camp at Station Wray, in Lawrence County, Ohio, about sixteen miles east of Ironton. At this station an observing tripod had been erected eighty feet in height. Heliotropes were posted at Stations Davis, in West Virginia, and Oakland, in Kentucky, and the signal at Gebhardt, VI' est Virginia, was visited and Yerified; but, owing to unfavorable weather, no observations were obtained till August 5. Meantime, it having been found that the line Wray-Buena Vista was not practicable 011 account of an intel'\·ening ridge, a change of scheme of triangulation became necessary, and after fiuishing obsel'\·ations on the stations to the eastwanl a reconnaissance was begun August 21, and the country b~tweeu Wr1ty and Bnena Vista thoroughly explored. At the beginning of this reconnaissance, and in the observations preceding, Mr. Mosman had the skillful and energetic aid of Prof. J. H. Gore, of the Columbian Universit~·, who served in the party as volunteer assistant from August 6 to August 23. A point called Tradd was finally selected on the ridge to the westward of Wray. From Tradd five of the primary stations were visible. Mr. ·\losman returned to camp September 1. During his absence Mr. J.E. McGrath, aid, bad report~d for duty. By September 6 the angles remaining had been measured at Wray, and on the 7th the theodolite was mounted at Gebhardt Station, in Cabell Count;y, West Virginia, about twenty miles north of Huntington. The direction from Geb· hardt to Tradd was quickly determined, and on September 9 preparations were begun for occupying Station Oakland, Boyd County, Kentucky, six miles south of Catlettsburg. At this station the theodolite was mounted npon a tripod forty-five feet high. A similar tripod was erected at Tradd by E. E. Ton·ey, foreman, and the line between Oakland and Tradd was opened by Mr. McGrath. Observations at Oakland were begun September 16. Mr. P.A. Mosman, who acted as recorder from the l>eginningof the season, left September 25, and Mr. W. B. Fairfield, extra observer, reported for duty on the same day. Work at Oakland was finished October 2, and preparations were then begun for moving to Baena Vista, about sixteen miles south of Greenup, Ky., in the county of that name. While the moving w~ in progress Station Tradd was occupied by Extra Observer W. B. Fairfield, who measured approximate angles there with an eight-inch the· odolite on Oakland, Buena Vista, and Wray. At Buena Vista the large theodolite (No. 118} was mounted on a concrete pier October 12. H.Ex.18--6

Signals of sixty.five feet at How land Station, and thirty feet at Cave Station had been erected and heliotropers posted. l'.y October 23 all of the observations ne.eded at Bueua Vista liad been obtained. The camp equipage wa!'I thm1 stored at Franklin Furnace; the party disbanded, a driver only being retained, and preparations were made for continuing the reconnaissance to the westward. As the country through which it was carried-the counties of Scioto and Adams, Ohio, bordering on the Ohio River-is very broken, thinly inhabited, and with but very few roads, much difficulty was cxperieuced in carryiug 011 the work. It was found necessary to erect a tripod aud scaffold one hundred feet high at Scioto Statiou, about four miles northwest of Portsmouth. On No,·ember 10, reconnaissance angles were measured from the top of this tripod. Meanwhile a station on Cherry Ridge, back of Concord, Ky., bad been selected. This point occupied a commanding position, giving a very fine \Tiew to the northward and westward. The weather continuing unfavorable, Mr. Mosman, after examining the difficult country between the bead waters of Blue Creek, Churn Creek, and upper and lower Twin Creeks for a central station decided to make a general examination of the country between Rome, on the Ohio River, and West Union, the county seat of Adams Count;y, which is situated on a high ridge and occupies the highest ground in the vicinity. From the top of a lofty building in this town, a ridge near Mineral Springs, Ohio, was found to be the most commanding position from which to see Scioto, Cherry Ridge, and the bills at the head of Twin Creek. · Mineral Springs was visitecl Novemher 22, and between that date and December 22 the reconnaissa11ce was steadily prosecuted by Mr . .l\fosman, much of the time through a heavily-wooded country, crossed b.r ridges of nearly equal height, and with not a few interruptions from snowstorms aud intensely cold weather, with high winds. His report of the work is accompanied by a Rketch showing the scheme of triangulation found most practicable. In addition to the two gentlemen already referred to as having served in the party, Assistant F. D. Granger was attached to it from September 26 to October 6. Extra Observer W. B. Fairfield was ordered to the party July 1, but owing to illness was unable to take the field till September 25. He was detached November 10. Mr. P. A. Mosman served as recorder till September 25, acting also for a time as foreman in moving and pitching camp, posting he1iotropers, &c. Mr. Mosman refers in terms of cordial appreciation to the interest in the work taken by the officers of his party and to their constant and zealous efforts for its advancement. He acknowl· edges also the efficient labors of his foreman, }}. E. Torrey.

SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, INCLUDING COAST, SEA-WATER CHANNELS, SOUNDS, HARBORS, AND RIVERS. (SKETCHES Nos. I, 5, 17, AND 18.)

Hydrographic survey in the Stono and Wadmelaw Rivers, South Carolina.-Some additional soundings being required to develop the hydrography of the inland passages which connect Charleston Harbor aud North Edil'lto River, Lieut. G. 0. Hanns, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, c~ommanding the steamer Arago, was directed to execute this work. The Stono and Wadmelaw Rivers are in many places very narrow and full of shoals, and it was found necessary to take soundiugs rapidly. As but three points of the old triangulation could be found near one end of the work, and but two at the other, it became necessary to lay out a small triangulation. This closed exactly upon the old points.

To obtain a well-determined plane of reference for the soundings, five tide-gauges were established between Martin's Point on Wadmelaw River and Elliott's Cut, Stono Rinir, a distance of nine teen miles. .As no station could be occupied during a lunar month, all gauges were compared with the self-registering gauge of the United States Engineers at Fort Sumter, where consecutin tides had been observed for a year or longer. Lieutenant Hanus bad the aid of the following-named officers: Ensigns E. F. Leiper, F. R Brainard, and George R. French, U. S. N.

PENINSULA OF FLORIDA, FROM SAINT MARY'S RIVER, ON THE EAST COAST, TO AND INCLUDING THE ANCLOTE KEYS ON THE WEST COAST, WITH THE COAST APPROACHES, REEFS, KEYS, SEAPORTS AND RIVERS. (SKETCHES Nos. 1, 6, 7, 17, and 16.)

Triangulation a.nd shore-line topography of Saint John'.~ Ri1Jer, frorn Nine-,l:We Point to Palatka.In continuation of the survey of the Saint John's RiY-er, Florida, Assistant Eugene Ellicott. was directed to proceed to Jacksonville, Fla., and await there the arrival of the schooner Ready. In March, 1885, he sailed to Nine-Mile Point, about tweuty miles below Palatka, and began a triangulation of the river. Upon the 17th of March this work was finished to the Devil's Elbow at the bead of the broad easily navigated part of the riYer, and about two miles above Palatka. The shore-line topography was then taken up and carried over the same ground. It was deemed desirable to postpone filling in details of topography in view of the expected early arrival of the hydrographic party. Mr. Ellicott states that the Saint John's is navigable for oce~n steamers to San Mateo, eight miles above Palatka, and that be thinks they go still further up when freights are offered. Trafiie on the riyer is larg£>, and the demand for a chart of the portion then under survey very great. From the entrance to Racy's l'oint,just above Nine-Mile Point, a chart of the Saint, John's has been published in four slwets. Much of the shore-line survey had to be done with the plane-table standing in from one to two and a half feet of water, and certain parts of the shore line are outlined only by an edge of cypress trees, the water extending back for an apparently indefinite distauce. From the Devil's Elbow, a sexta11t triangulation was carried, and au approximate shore line delineated as far as San Mateo. On the 15th of April Mr. Ellicott, in accordance with instructions, turned the Re.ady over to Liente11ant Hanus, U. 8. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, and the next day proceeded northward. Duty subsequently assigned to him has been referred to under the headings of Sections I and III. Hydrographw survey of Sa,int ,John's River from Racy Point to Palatka.-Upon the eom11letion of the triangulation and shore-line topography of tbe Saint John's River between the limits mentioned under the previous beading, Lieut. G. C. Hanus, U. S. N ., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the st.earner .Arago, began a hydrographic survey extending from Racy Point (just above Nine-Mile Point) to Sau Mateo, about four and one half miles (by the river) below Palatka: On the 16th of April, Lieutenant Hanus was detached from the party for other duty, and in pursuanoo of instrucLions transferred the command of the .Arago to Ensign E. F. Leiper, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, under whose direction the work was completed. At the beginning of the survey, the river was almost two miles wide, and lines of sounding!! about three hundred meters (nine hundred and eighty-four feet) apart were run as nearly normal to the shore as practicable. As the width of the river decreased the lines of sounding1:1 wert~ run

closer.
'fbe time allowed for the work being very short, no attempt was made to sound out the creeks;

only two of these, however, were navigable, Deep Creek and Rice Creek. A sextant triangulation having been made in advance by the topographical party, and an approximate shore line determined as far as Sau Mateo, tl1e hydrography was completed to that point. A. plane of reference for the sountlings was determined by obsenatfons with a box-gauge secured to one of the pile,s of the wharf of the Tropical Hotel at Palatka. Tides were observed during thirteen days and twenty consecutive low waters taken. A bench-mark was established on the post of piazza of the hotel. The mean rise of tides ouserve<l was nine-tenths of a foot. Ensign Leiper bad the aid of Ensigns l<'. R. Brainard and G. R. French, U. S. N.

I!Jusign Leiper was directed to proceed to New York upon the completion of his survey and report for duty on board the steamer Endeavor. JJeep-sea sounding.~ in Northwest -Providenc" Channel and in the G1i7j Stream ojf ~'lorida coast, and subcurrent obser1.1ations in tlle Gu{f' Stream bet·ween Fowcy Rocks and Gun Cay, Bahamas.-Early in December, 1884, I.Jieut. .J. E. Pillsbury, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was detached from duty i11 tl1e ofllce of the Hrdrographic Inspector arnl directed to proceed to New York and relieve Lieut. CommaniJer vV. H. Brownson, U. S. N., Assistant in the Survey, of the charge of the steamer Blake, and hydrographic party aboard that vessel. Unde,r Lieutenant Pillsbury's command, the Blake was brought to Washington in pursuance of additional instructions, and fitted for deep-sea sounding and current work oft' the Florida coast. The Blake left _Wa<1hington February 6, 1885, and arrived at her working ground February 18. She foft the Florida coast at the close of the season, June 2, re,ached CharleRton, S. C., June 4, and convoyed the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Arago north. Lieutenant Pillsbury bas submitted a full report (Appendix No. 14) of his season's work, which was a remarlrnhly successful one. Fh·e lines of soundings were run in the Gulf Stream to the southeast of Cape Canaveral, two lines of soundings across tne str~am between Cape Florida and Jupiter Inlet, and three lines in Northwest Providence Cbannel between Bahama Island, Great Abaco, and Great Bahama Bank. Tidal observations were made during six weeks with a box-gauge established at the Fowey Rocks ligbt-l1ouse. Seventeen stations were occupied for current observatio11s in the Gulf Stream between Fowey Rocks and Gun Cay, Bahamas. For the observation of snbcnrre,nts a current meter was invented and constructed by Lieutenant PilJsbury. One of the conditions of the successful use of this meter was that the steamer should be safely and expeditiously anchored at sea. For this purpose, a Rteel wire rope of five-eighths and three-fourths of an inch in diameter was used instead of chain or manilla. This wire, rope was carried on a large reel and led from that to the drum of the hoisting engine, and from tl1(·11ce through a large iron pulley at t11e eud of a spar over the bow. This spar was binged at its inner eud to a hea\'Y post in the bow and its outer end was held up at an angle of forty-five degrees by a steel wire rope or topping lift, leading over the, masthead and to the deck aft. Interposed in this topping lift was an arrangement of rubber buffers, about eight feet in length, desig11ed to take up the slack and relieve the sudden strain on the anchoring rope as the vessel pitched. With this gear the Blake could be anchored in four hundred fathoms in about fifteen minutes, and could get under way in about forty-five minutes. The current meter consisted of (1) a systt>m of cones revolving around an axis, and registering by means of differential wheels; (2) a freely moving rudder; (3) a compass; (4) an arrangement of wings or fins by which the com11ass needle and rudder are clamped at the instant of beginning to pull the meter upward through the water; and (5) a propeller whiclt locks the needle and rudder after they have been clampefl by the fins, by a eoutinuation of tlH\ npward movement. The met.e,r was lowered by a steel wire, and, in order to keep it from being. swept astern by tlie current, it was attached by a ro11cr to another wire called a jackstay, down which it was free to move. This jackstay wire wa.s anchored on the bottom and kept np and down by weight.s.

Lieutenant Pillsbury states that the meter worked well, and believes that its results may be accepted with confidence. The plan proposed for the seaoion's work was to take a series of current observations with soundings at stations between Gun Cay, Bahama Banks, and Fowey Hocks, I~lorida, followl'd h:i' a similar series between Yucatan and Cuba, and then to re11eat the first series. Results derived from the first series seemed to indicate that tidal action was more marked than had been supposed; that the axis of the stream was 11ot where it bad been put by tbe old observations, and that the greatest velocity was at or wr' m·ar the surface. These results Jed Lieutenant Pillsbury to ask that bis original instructions should be modified 80 as to confine the current obserYations to tl1e Florida cross-section. Fi·e pri11cipal cnrrPut stations were accordingly occupied between the Fowey Rocks and Gun Cay. These station8 wPre at about equal distances from each other and from the laud on either 8ide. l'our of them were OCCUJlied during periods of from forty to seventy hours caeb, aiul oue, situatctl about eight miles from Fowey Rocks, over four hundred hours. Quoting from Lieutenant PillsburJ's summary report; "The record shows, first,, that there is a diurnal Yariation in tbc velocity of tlte stream, ammmt. ing in Rome instances to nearly two knots, and that this ,·ariation extendi;; to the subcurrents as far as observed (one hundred and thirty fathoms). "Second. That there is a monthly variation in the yelocity, amounting to about three 1:uots, with the condition8 of the i::nn and moon both haYiu~ _creat declination. "Third. Tlint tLe axis of the strPam at this portiou of it is proliably not in tlie positio11 !inp· posed by Professor Bache, but is situated more to the westward. The exact positiou coultl uot he determined in the time allotted to the work. "Fourth. Tha.t the direction of the upper currents, at three and a half, fifteen, an cl thirty fathoms, remained approximately north. The sub-murents at sixty-fire and one huudred and thirty fathoms changed somewhat in dirention with the diurnal yariation ill Yelocity, often as much as fi\·e points on either side of the rueridiau, and in one or two instancl's ::it one huudred and thirty fathoms the rudder indicated a southerly current. This, howen·r, was at the shoall'.r anchorage, two hundred fathoms in depth, and with a Yelocity of but a tpnth or two, and it is pos8ible that with such a weak currc·nt th(' instrument was in error, although there was 110 e\·ideuce that such was the case. "Fifth. That the velocit.r of the subcurrents was in some instances greater than that of the surface current, but the mean of about an equal number of observations on the prini~iJJal stations, as well as the mean of all the observations on the long station, showed a less velocity in the subcurrents. A continuation of the vertical curves below the poiut of the greatest depth observed seems to indicate that there is no current at the bottom, but this conclusion may be changed by a complet.e discussion of the observations on some of the stations." TheAe results are of great interest as a contributiou to our knowledge of the currents of the Gulf Stream, and similar observations carriecl through anothe11 season with the experience gained by Lieutenant Pillsbury will add to their value. The following named officers were attached to the Blake: Ensigns A. F. Fecbteler, P. J. Werlich, W. A. Thom, William Truxtun, E. Simpson, and M. C. Gorgas, U.S. N.

While at Ke~· West, in March, 1885, Lieutenant Pillslmry rendered an important service to the steamer Alamo of the l\lallor_y line, wbicb bad run ashore on Southwest Reef, Tortugas, in a nl.ry dange.rous position. Learning this, he went at once to her assistance, aucl altlwugb the light-house teuller I.-aurel was already cloing her utmost to get the Alamo off, and the Blake aided the Laurel iu to1viug at high water, their united efforts were unavailing during five trials. An anchor was tlwn planted on the port bow of the vessel t-0 haul it to wind ward, and on the sixt,11 trial the revenue steamer Dix, which l1ad arriYed to reuder aid, hauling on the port quarter, and the Laurel and l31ake pulling astern, the Alamo came off practically uninjured. In the work of relief the deep anchoring gear of the Blake was of great service. At the close of the seasou tlle Blake was taken to Hampton Roads, and thence to Boston, to be prepared for work on the New England coast. Duty on that coast, aRsigned to Lieutenant Pillslmry at the beginuing of the fiscal year, bas been already referred to under the heatj_ing of Section I. Determination of grarity at Key lVi~at.-Towards the end of February, 1885, in pursuance of instructions, Assistant 0. S. Peirce proceeded to Key West, Fla., to determiue the intensity of gravity. Authority haYiilg· been obtained from the Secretary of War, a station was selected in the barracks at Key \Vest. Pendulum No. 2 was set up and oscillated, heavy end up and heavy end down. Tbe nsnal transits for time were obsen·ed. Mr. Peirce ha1:1 reported as a preliminary result from his field computations that gravity ii,; in excess on Ke3- 'West relative to Washington hy an amount prolluch1g l8.46 error iu a clock per diem. Field operatio11s were completecl at Ke~· '\\'P;;it station h~· the 1st of 1\fay. Mr. W .. B. Fairfield, extra obserYer, took part in all of the observations. In his report. Mr. Peirce speaks in terms of the highest commendation of Mr. Fairfield's services. Referring to the fact that the residual difference of gravity between Washington and Key \Vest is solllewhat smaller than be bad anticipated, Mr. Peirce expresses the opinion that the question to which grayity research should be directed more particularly for the present is, whether lines of eqnal residual gra;dty can be traced upon the map, or whetller the Inl'rely local variations will mask those that are progressive, and that for this purpose lines ot statious a thousand miles or so in length should l>e run with stations three degrees apart. lint tlrnt a north and south line WiJJ DC\'eJ' afford SO clear !l {lfOOf Of the existeBCe Of progresii'iVe YaJ'iatiOU in the residua} gravity al:l an cast aud west one, because with the former there would always remain a doubt whether the assumed latitude correction was right for this part of the world, and though its being different in different ruuts of the globe would necessarily imply progressive variation along 1be circles of latitude, yet that might be so slow as not clearly to show itself, say in a thousand miles, without which curves could ha!tll;r be drawu. The first endeavor should therefore he to run an ea.st and west line. Beach measure and topography on the 1cest coast of lllorida from Bowditch Point to Cape Romano.-Iu continuation of the survey of the west coast of Florida, from the vicinity of Punta l{asa towards Cape Sable, Assistant Joseph Bergesbeimcr was directed to organize his party for beac11 measure aud topography on board the schooner Quick. The Quick was got ready for sea at as early a date as practicable, and r(lached Punta Rasa, with Mr. Hergesheimer aml party on board, December 18, 1884. The topography of the beach and inlets was begun at Bowditch Point, ahout t11ree a.ml a half miles south of l'nnta Rassa, and was completed to Wiggins Pass, a distance of about twelve miles, by December 26. Leaving Punta Rasa on the 29th, Mr. Hergesheimer ancbo1·ed the schooner the next. day in Big Marco Pass, and began the beaeh measure and topography from Wiggins Pass to Cape R-0mano, thirty-three miles. .As determined by this work, the geographical position of Cape Romano is a preliminary one, hut sufficiently correct for topographic or hydrographic purposes. From Caximbaa Pass to Cape Romano the distance was carefully mea.snred twice with a twenty-meter chain. Unusually stormy weather prevailed during the season, there being a succession of northel'ff with lower temperatures than bad been known in that, locality for many yt'.ars. Field operations were closell March 28. Before leaving the field, Mr. Bergesheimer furnished Lieutenant Heald, commanding the

steamer Bache, with the geographical positiou of the points needed for his hydrogra11hical work on that coast. The Quick was laid up in Manatee River, in charge of a competent ship-keeper, at the close of the season. Mr. J. Henry Turner, Aid, joined the party January 27, and rendered efficient service during tbe remainder of the season. Mr. Hergesheimer states that the only anchorages for a vessel drawing between fixe and ~igbt feet of water between Punta Hasa and Cape Romano are Big Carlos and Big Marco Inlets. Big Marco is 11 good harbor; there are from eight to teu feet of water 011 the bar, a:id the cha11ncl was wide enough for the Quick to heat in.

E. D. F. Heald, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Sun'ey, was directed to take command of the steamer A. D. Bache, and prepare her for 8Crvice in southern water!l. A month later, a h~ drographic part~· ha Ying been organized on board the Bache, and the vessel having been made ready for sea, Lieutenant Heald received instructions to execute hydrographic work on the coasts of Alabama a11d LoniRiaua and on the west coast of Florida. 'J'he first named work having been completed, the Bache arrived off the Florida coast early iu May, 1885, and began the hydrographie survey from the southern limit of Lieutenant Mansfiel!l's work in 1884, near Gordon's Pass. Lieutenant Heald's survey was based upon points determined autl shore line furnished by Assistant Joseph Hergesheimer, then at work on that coast. From G01·don's Pass to Cape tlomano, the southern limit of Lieutenant Heald's survey, ship lines of soundings were run one mile apart to develop the ten-fathom curve, and from the boats lines were run one-quarter of a mile apart to develop the three-fathom cnne. Information having been received at this office from Mr. P. L. Cosgrove, ma!!ter of the ligl1thouse tender, Laurel, of the existence of an uucharted reef between Marquesas Hock a11d Omt!-Biu Shoal, Lieu~nant Heald was directed fo Pxamine the locality. He fonn1l a. shoal on a line joining Marquesas Rock with Coal-Bin Shoal, and on the followmg hearing!!: Marquesas Rock, west one and a quarter ruiles. Coal-Bin Shoal, ea!lt fiye and three-eighths miles. Western extremity Marquesas Keys, north one-half east six miles. The least water found was· tiixteen feet. It is situated on the crown of the Plorida Reefs, and is named "Cosgrove Shoa.I, after the person who first announced it. A notice to mariners was issued, reporting the result of Lieutenant Heald's examination. In this, as in similar notices issued by this office, all bearings are magnetic, all t1istance8 in nautical miles, and all depths at mean low water. Ensigns T. D. Grifiin, J. M. Orchard, A. Jeffries, W. C. Canfield, and J. K Cra.ven, U. S. N., were attached to the party.

Continuation (!l reconnaissancr for the connection of the triangulation of the Gulf coast with that alang the Blue Ridge.-Reference was made in tbe last annual report to a reconnaissance carried southwesterl.r from stations in Northern Alabama by Assistant 0. H. Tittmann, under instructions to ascertain the most practicable routr: for extending tbe Blue Ridge triangulation to the Gulf of .Mexico. In November, 1884, Assistant Tittmann was directed to resume this work, and to begin in the vicinity of Mobile. His plan wa;; to examine in detail the country in the immediate vicinity of that port, to reconnoiter the valley of the Alabama River, an<l to continue the selection of 1mints in the more northern J>Ortion of the State, determining the geographical positions of these points· with some accuracy. Leaving V{ashington December 4, Mr. Tittmann began his reconmtissance at Spriug Hill, six miles west of the city, lrnvillg previously had a oonsultation wit.h Prof. Eugene A. Smith, State geologist. Professor Smith's knowledge of the country to be traversed enabled him to commuuicate valuable information which was most freely antl courteously accorded. Au examination of the Alabama Ri>er as far as Selma was made, and notes taken of the coun. try, as also of localities near Mobile and in the viciuity of Monnt Vernon, the site of the United States barracks of that name, thirty miles north of Mobile. There is a crest of hills at this point rising to a heig·ht of about one hundred and eigl1ty ftet above tide.levnL On the eastern sitle of the river the hills attain a heig-ht of about three hundred feet. On both sides they are covered with heavy growths of pine. Mr. Tittmann reports that the most feasillle method of conducting the work from Mobile to Choctaw Bluff in Clark County, a distance of fifty miles, would be hy a scheme of triangulation inrnlving long lines on the west side, an<l forming the bases of overlapping triangles, the sides of which wonld be carried by diagonals to points across the river. Quadrilaterals could doubtless he formed if time enough were given for the selection of the points. Mr. Tittmann resumed the reconnaissance in the northern part of the State about the middle of February, and bas submitted a sketch showing the i1lan of a proposed triangulation. Much delay was occasioned by the unusual dryness of the season, which caused an accumulation of smoke from the hnrning- of brush :ind lea,ves in the woods. At the beginning of l\fa.y, field operations wern elosed . .Mr. George I<'. Bird served efficiently as aid iu the party. Early in .June, Mr. Tittmann was· assigned to duty, reference to whicl1 bas been made under the heading of Section II. Hydrographic work in Mobile Bay and around t1te Okandeleur Islands.-An examination of the newly dredged channel in Mobile Bay having become necessary in order to correct the published charts of that locality, and it being desirable to ascertain the nature and extent of other changes reported to have taken place in the bay, Lieut. E. D. F. Heald, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was instructed to organize a bydrograpbic party on board the f!teamer A. D. Baclie for the execution of tbat work. The dredged channel ·rnries in width from one hundred and fifteen feet to two hundred feet, and in depth from fifteen and a half to twenty-two feet. It extends from the city of Mobile to the Lower Fleet in Mobile Bay, and is indicated b.f clusters of piles, fifty-one in number, one half a mile apart .on the eastern side, the center of the channel being one hundred feet west of the Jine of piles. In March, 1885, Lieutenant Heald began his survey by determiuing the direction of this channel and the positions of the beacons and clusters of piles which are intended as per ma11ent " aids to navigation." All of these were located and plotted upon the projcctfon. Lieutenant Heald states that it is the intention of the Light-House Board to place a light at. the south entrance in the position of Cluster No. 51. The lower portion of the channel, where the least depth is found, is now being redredged, and wiH soon have a depth, of eighteen feet. Owing to the nature of the bottom, which is a soft

Determination of the longitudes of Littl~ Rock, 7'e.rnrka.na, and Fort Smith, 1lrk.-In 1\la.rcli, 1885, instructions were is>me<l, organizing threl' longitudt' parties for tlu· f'.nsning sr.:tson, two of these parties for the determination of primnry statiow; aml one for srcmHlary. ARsistant Edwin Smitl1 waA placed in genera.I charge of the work; Assistant U. FL Sirwlair was assigned to the charge of the snbparty for primary determinations, and Snbassistant E. D. Preston was detailed in charge of the subparty at secondary station:;.. The plan of operations included the determination of three stations in Arkarnml'I, mw of them . Little Rock, a primary station, and two others, Texarkana and Fort Smith, secondary. At Fort Smith and Texarkana observations were to he nrnde for latitude also. By the middle of April Mr. Smith was at Galveston, Tex., the initial point from which Little Hock was. to be determined. At the latter l'ltatio11 Assista11t Sinelair estaolishcd a trnnporary obserYatory. Continuous bad wea.ther for upwards of· ten tlays dela;yed the beginning of the work. Exchanges of telegraphic signals we1·e obtained on the night;.; of April 28 a11<l 30, :!\fay :;, 4, 6, and 9, but of these the nights of April 28 and May 4 wi>re imperfect. The observers tlwn changed places, and, Mr. Smith being at l.ittle Rock and Mr. Sinclair i1t. Galveston, the longittule tletermiuation was completed by exchanges obtained on tl1e nights of May 1~, 14, 15, an(l 21. The next deterrniuatio11s made were those of Kansas Uity, Mo., and Texarkana, on the hound. ary line between the States of Texas and Arkansas. That of Kansas Uity will be referred to umler the heading of Section XV. For the longitude of Texarkana signals were excha11ged hetwe~n Assistant Smith at Lit.tle Rock and Suba.ssistirnt Preston at Texarkana. This being a secondar~' station, the obsen·ers did not cuauge places. Longitude signals were snccessfully exchanged 011 the nights of May 30, 31, June 1 and 2. Mr. Preston determined the latitude of his station, co1111ected its position with that of the ninet.y-eighth mile-stone north of the Sabine Uivcr on the boundary line between Texas aml Arkansas, and established a meridian line for the city engineer. He then proceeded to Fort Smith, Ark., from which point be exchanged longitude sig11als with the obser¥er at Little Rock, Mr. Sinclair, who had exchanged stations wit.h l\Ir. Smith. The exchanges of signals for longitude between MeAsrs. Smith and Sinclair will he referred to under the beading of Section XV. With Litt.le Rock excbangf's of longitude signals were obtained on the nights of Jane 12, 18, 19, and 20. Mr. Preston determine<l the latitude of his astronomical station, and connected it in position with the stone monument which marks the line between the State of Arkansas and tbe Oboctaw Nation (lndian Territory). This monument is ca.lled "Initial Point," and all miles on the State line count north and south from it. A meridian line wa.'I also established for the City Eugineer.

Hytlrographfr siwr1y <!.ff" the e<!ast of Lo1tiliia1111 from Sabine Pass east'U'ard.-In continuation of the hy<lrograph,v of the coast of Louisiana from Sabine Pass eastward, Lieut. F. H. Crosby, U.S. N., Assistant Uoast and Geodetic Smrny, was iui;tructed, in December, 1884, to complete the titting of the steamer Gedney for sea, mid proceell at as early a date as practicable to Sabine Pass. Upon reirnhing that locality at the lleginni·1g of March, Lieutenant Crosby establisl1ed his principal tidc·gau~e for the season on Dorman's wharf at Sabine Pass. This gauge, ii simple staff 11ailed to the wharf piling, it:s numbers i11creasi11~ with rise of tide, was observed coutinuousl;\· from March 10 t-0 June 5. A seconll gauge was located at the mouth of the Calcasieu Rh-er, and observed dul"iug three days. Owiug to the fret-1bets iu the riYer during the SJlriug season it was found impossible to m;tablish a plane of reference b.'' observation, but thl'Ough the courteRy of tile United States Army engineers engaged in coustruetiug jetties on the bar at Sabine PaliS, Lien· tenant Crosby was enabled to get a comparison with their self-registering gauge at that locality.

Hurney of the coa.\t li·ne connecting the work at 8an ,Juan Oapixtrano uJith that at Ne1oport Bay, Ca7Jiforni1t.-At the 1Jegi1111ing of the fiseal year, Assistant A. F. Rodgers had organized his party, in pnr.'inauce of instrnctfous, and was engaged in the work of completing the co:u,;t-line surve~· l>etwoon Siw .Juau Uapistra110 aml Newport Bay, California. Between July 1 and 15 three of the points of the triangulation of 1875 in the vicinit.y of Newport Bay were recovered; the necessary sigrnils, tweuty-cight in number, to continue the e<'ast triangulation to San Jmw Capistrano were theu erected, aud a general reco1111aissa11ce wal'i made from that vicinity southward to Sau Diego Bay. OH ,July 1.j Mr. ltodgers proeeeded to Sau Francisco to ptHchase an outfit of tents for his part..r, aud to attend to certain office work that was neecle<l. He made and forwarded to the office ll traciug of the shore-line survey from San Juan Capistrano southwarll to San .Mateo Point. Ou A ngtrnt 7 he left San Francisco for t.he south coast, aml mornd his party to JJagnna Canon. Snhassi1>tant Isaac Winston reported for duty in the party August 14. During August and Septem· ber obser,·atious of horizontal angles were pro;,ecuted, and early in October the "field computatiom> were ;,;ufficieutly a(hanccd to furnish data for the pr~jectfon of a topographical sheet to cover the iiurniy ot' the shore line included in the tria11g11Jation. This topographic survey was prosecuted till Non.1m!Jer 1, when tlie exhaustion of the appropriation compelled the suspension of field operatious. Mr. Itotlgers acknowledges the courtesy of lion. H.ichard Egau, of Sau Juan Oapistrano, in giYi11g tJrn use of an adobe building, comparatively fire proof, for the storage of the instruments at the close of the smt1>on, free of charge. He couunends ah;o tho efficient and ever-re;idy sei·vice of l\Ir. \\'it18to11, who remained with the party until its arrival in San lfrancisco, when he was lletached aml ordered to dut~· at Los A.ugeles. lJuriug tlw remainder of the fiscal year Assistant Itodgers was engaged on office w-0rk at San Francisco. On December 26, at the request of Assistant lJavitlsou, who hall been ordered to Washington, lrn took charge of the suboffice at Sau :Frauciseo, aud cout-inued on that duty till Mr. Da\'idson's return in April. At the close of the fiscal year hi:' had made all arra11l!emeuts to take the field in accordance with instructions, and left San .Franci8co, u.r the soath coast i;teamer, June 30.

Mr. Terry has submitted a full report of hiH work during the eleven mouths endiug with June, 1885. 'l'he photographic records of the elements of the relative magnetic declination, dip, aml iutensity, with the .Adie maguetographs were made as uearl~· conti11uou:s as possible. During three days near t.he midclle of each mouth obsen·ations were lllalfo to determine the ahiwlute declination, dip, and horizontal intensity, aud from these ausolnte Yertical force aml total iuteu;;it.y were deduced. Time was determined ouce a mouth by observations of the sun. Ou September 7 and No\'ember 30 the vertical force magnet was rebalaueml, awl on the 8:lllll'I dates, aml also on December 4, its scale values were redetermined. 1'he nuiillar, uililar, a111l vertical force scales were read each day before and after ehauging the photog-r:tphic papen~; rrnMliugs were taken also of the maximum and minimum thermometer8 each da.,\' at 8 a. 111. and 5. p. m. Hourly readiugs of the uuitilar, bifilar, and vertical force traces were made, and hourly, daily, aml monthly means for eaeh month deduced . .At the time Mr. Terrs took charge of the ohserYatory much difficulty had helm experieucetl in obtaining photographic traees of Rntlicie11t distinct1rnss, hut by using tile greateRt care he W:t8 ahlP to procure a recor(i. 111 No\'ember, 188·i, by making some slight changes in the sensitiziug process, and by the use of new trays, some improvement was secured, and on the fat of ,J nne, 1885, gelatino-bromide paper was substituted for the hromo-iodide of silver paper JHeYiously i11 use, 'fhe gelatino-bromide paper, Mr. Terry reports as ha\·iug tbe iulvantag·e of reducing the amount o!' labor needed to procure a record, and as far more uniform aud continuous iu its re:mlt:s.

The station selected for occupation was Rock)· Butte, a, primary point of' three tlwuisaud four humlred tCet elevation, about six miles from the <·oast. Knowing the violence of the winter gales, l\>lr. Lawson dee111ed it <Hh'isable to erect a te111p11rary wooden observatory for the shelter of the iustrumcuts, instead of usiug tents, and the adrn11tagt1 of so doing was iiroved by experience, one of the heavy raiu storms- accompanied lly high wimh1 having lasted ten 'days. The work at Hocky Butte consisted of horizontal and vertical measures, aud ohsernttious for time and latitude. For horizontal direction observations were made upou thirteen o~jccts, six of which were beliotropea at 11riruary stations, one the light-house at l'iedras Blancas, oue a station at Hollister J>eak, and five poles, four of which belonged to the tertiary coast triangulation. The theodolite was used in twenty-three positions; and at an of the pointings on the principal stations, readings of the ocular micrometer were taken. On all prominent mountain peaks and objects within the horizon of the station pointings were made. For elevation, measurements of double zenith distances were made on six main stations and on ten other objects. For time, observations were made on six nights, and for the latitude of the station twentynine pair8 of stam were observed on sev-eu nights. The instruments used in the several classes

He was to take charge of the snhoffice at San Francisco, aml regulate all tletails comwcted with it. Unring his abse11cc in the sumnH~r of 1884 the work of copying a.nd computing the tria11guJa,. ti on, astrouomicalJ aud magnetic obseryatiom; of the previous season was completed, and as soon as a prospe..ct of' fair weatlwr for field work ap1leare1l, Mr. Daddsou's part.r occnpied Mount Diitblo, a Rtntiou of the main chain in Contra Costa County. At Mount Diablo horizontal and vertical augleA and magnetic tleclinatio11 were observed. The instruments used were the twcnt_y-in<ih theodolite N"o. H5, Yertical circle No. 80, and mah'lietometer No. 3. Extremely boisterous weatht>r prevailed antl long storms retarded the work. Mr. Davidson remarks that at this station th<> experience of the party in the pre,·ious triaugulat;on work was Yeriliecl with regard to the better 8howing of the heliotropes in t.he winter months al': eomparnd wit.l1 the summer, but the drawbacks in rainy seasons are very great wlrnn the part,r has to move to dift'ereut stations or is encamped at an exposed station. BJ· the encl of December all of tbe observations required at Mount Diablo ha.d heen ohtainefl, and prepanitions were heg1111 for moYing camp to Toro Mou11tai11, :t titatioa of the primary co:tt1t. triangulatiou, about ninety-fh·e miles in a southwesterly direction from Diablo. Ohst1rv.ition8 at Toro were begun ,famrnry 20. The same character of work was done as at Diahlo, with the adtliti011 of observations for time, latitude, aud azimuth. .Field work at ':"oro was closed, aud the party dischm·ge<l February 13.

conclusions arc decidedly adverse to the supposition that any changes of moment have occurred. Somf\ extractR from hiR transmitting letter will be of interest. ''It bas been asserted recently that the south channel had l.Jeeu abandoned on account of the. ishoaling. T!Jis statement is qirectly contrary to the fact. On the afremoon of the day the statement was published, I saw a deeply laden Britisll bark crossiug by the western edge of tlle south ellannel when the bar was very rough, almost breakiug all round." " It has been asserted that great deposits ha\·e taken plaee inside the bar within the tenfatliorn line; the statement is contrary to the fact. It is relied · ... on a" necessarily proving deposition of material, that the muddy waters of the Sacranw·.to R' er de»osit their material on the bar, &c. In a certain degree, this action of deposition is iuev;table, but it will ·first take phice in more favorable situations than on the bar. I have shown, mau;y years since. that the deeply discolored waters of the Sacramento and other rivers were carried 11orth of Point Reyes." "I wish to repeat former recommendations which I have made on the subject: that every ten years a minute resurvey of the bar and immediate approaches sllouill he made to study the law of dwnge, 'if there be any. With this survey there shonhl be such an examination of the material of the Lar as would establish the source of the supply. I belieYe that it is mainly due the coast eddy current from the southern shore line." Self registering tide-gauge record kept up at Saucelito, S<m Franc·isco Ba,y.-Assh:taut Davidson reports that the work at this station, which is carried on under Lis supervision by Mr. E. Gray, bas been of uniformly good character and without break in tlle record during the year. The tab· nlations and the original sheets have been regularly forwarded to the oflice. Observations for time and comparisons of chronometers were made when required iJy Mr. C. B. Hill. During the year the pier was in some danger, because the teredo had destroyed uearly all the bracing of the piles and the iirotection against heavy swells. The repairs necessary were made. Reference to the work of the Alaska tidal party, also under Mr. Davidson's general supervision, will be found under the heading of Section XII. Hydrographic tmrt'eys 01i the California coa.st in Humboldt Bay 1rnd bctu·een Brushy Point and White Rocl.:.-lu pursuance of instructiou.s for the executiou of liydrographic work 011 the north coast of California, Lieut. E. D. Taussig, U. S. N., Assistant Coast aud Geodetic Surrny, commanding the steamer .McArthur, left San Francisco, October 18, 188!, bound for Humooldt Bay. An examination of this bay and its approaches was made a secondary object, to be accomplished when work outside off Cape Mendocino was found impracticable, but every attempt made by Lieuteuaut Taussig to do off.shore work was frustrated by bad weather, so tltat ultimately he was compelled to confine hiR survey to the waters of Humboldt Bay. The months of N ovem oer and December, which are geuerall,y favorable, proved particularly stormy in 1884. The suney of Humboldt Bar was made iu the large life boat of tbe life saving station. The bar, especiall.Y during the winter months, i8 generally rough. Vessels are detained not unfre· quently for man.r days in going out, and sometimes in coming in. With reg·anl to the channel, Lieutenant 'l'am;sig found that since last October it ha<l been to the southward of the middle ground, and for eighteen mouths before that time to the northward, changiu~ so frequently, however, that no chart can be of any aid to a stranger crossing the bar. The positions of the buoys on the bar and in the channels are ofteu changed l.Jy the pilot tugs, but not as often as the channels change, and the buoys rnul!t not be accepted, therefore, as guides by strangers. 'l.10 obtain a plane of reference for the 1mu11dings, a tide.gauge was established at Field's Landing. Lienteuaut Taussig expresses bis special indebtedness to En~igu J. N. Jor<lau, U. S. N., for unflagging zeal and attention to duty. Ensigns W. L. Burdick and F. A. l\fcNutt, lT. S . .N., were also attached to the 11arty, and rendered acceptable service.

Early in December the McArthur returned to San Francisco, and was taken to the l\Iare Island 11avy-yard for repairs. 011 the 8th of April, 1885, all preparations haviug been completed for work on the north coast, Lieutenant Taussig and his party left Sau Francisco for Brm;hy Point, and anchored off that point the next day. Ile was provided with two hydrographie sheets, each on a scale (\f 1-20000; the first with limits from Brushy Point to Ussal Rock, the second from Ussal Rock to White Rock. Lieutenant Taussig obsen·es t!Jat the general hydrographic features of this part of the coast are in the main similar to those of the coast immediately to the south ward. The lan<l i::1 lloltler, the coast range comes close to the ocean, and at times so close as to rise almost vertically from the sea. Here and there a tlat ltas induced a settler to start a cattle ranch. The anchorages along thiR section are not to be recommended. Noue of them have a11J· lee. A few projecting rocks, with a more or less fancied freedom from undertow, or affording svme slig·ht protection from the full streugtl.i of the wind have induced some persons to build chutes from Bruishy Point, Kibessilab, ·westport, Cottaueva, and Bear Harbor, and when the roads are passable, and the southeast gales not too frequent, these chutes do a lively business in shipping bark and redwood lumb1~r. The projecting headlands at Cottanern, Big White Rock, Bear Harbor, Shelter Cove, and Point Gorda break the force of tbe F<ca in the strong northwesters that prevail during tlte summer months. The small coasting steamers take advantage of this in running up the coast. Strangers, however, uufamiliar with the coast aud the soundings near it! should not approach it, between Brushy J'oiut anll Ussal Rock, nearer than half a mile without great caution. The dangers are as a rule in sight, but the uneven and rocky character of the bott-Om and the peculiar form of some of the sunkeu rocks makes it \'ery probable that a number are as yet uncharted. With the above general statement, Lieutenant Taussig presents in his repon full details respecting the several localities included in his survey. To obtain planes of reference for his so~nuings, be established a tide-gauge at one of the roeks near the south chute at 'Vestport. At this point tides were observed from April 12 to June 121 inclusive. Tidal observations were made also at Little niver for two days to connect wit,h the tide-level at Westport, and also to reduce the supplementary soundings taken in Little Riwr to define the line of reef, ancl to locate a piuuacle rock (heretofore unknown) in the northwestern part of the harbor. 'fbe following named officers served on board the McArthur during this work; Ensign J. :K. Jordan, U.S. N., till his detachment May 31, and Ensigns W-. L. Burdick, J. A.. Bell, and F. A. McNutt, U.

Triangula.tion and topography of the UrnzJquak River, Oregon.-In continuation of the survey of the Umpquah River and of the adjacent coast, Assistant Louis A. Sentgeller took the field, untler instructions, at as early a period in the s1nfog of 1885 as the allotment for his work would permit. Having organized bis part;y towards the end of April, be established his camp ou the Umpqualt early in May, and pl'OC(!eded at once to recover and readjust the triangulation stations of preceding seasons, re-establishing two stations which had been {festroyed. The season proYing to be favorable, the triangulation north of the U mpquab was resumed and devoloped so far as necessary to insure a permanent base or bases for future requirements in carrying the work northward. The selection of stations was attended with difficulty, owing to the format.ion of the country;

abrupt and 11igh F>alld hills, timh1,red close to the coast line. Observations of horizontal angles were begun l\lay 12 and contin1wtl til1 .June 14, at which date complete connections had been established to tlw northward, and i,mflicient results obtained to furnish the points necessary for the topography and 11yd rog-1·aph~· of the U mpquah River. On Juue 16 the e11tirr party wa~ transferred to the lwach between Umpquab River and Coos Bay, with a \·iew of' effe<"iiu.f.! a .innction with the triangulation which had been executed in that locality by Assistant ,Tames S. Lawson. A trmporary camp having been established at Ten.Mile Creek, about half way 1wtween the two entrances, a reconnais>1ance was developed from the creek, both northward and sonthward, while at the same time obliien·ations of horizontal angles were made to follow up the reeomiaissance as it advanced from the Umpquah. Towanh; tlie 1·1Hl of .Juue J\Ir. Sengeteller proce.eded with hi11 part.v to Empire Oit.y, Coos Bay, and in that vicinity recovered two stations of the former triangulation, the line joining which served as a bai;e for tlic dcsir<.'d connection. Until .June 30 the reconnaissance and erection of stations southward from tlic recoYere<l liue 11 Pony-Simpson" was continued, a complete junction being effecte1l, leaYing two statiou8 to he erected, and, if possible, one of former work to be recovered. South of Umpquah Ri\·rr and toward Coos Ray the character of country was found to be similar to that alread~- alluded to north of Umpquab entrance, namely, a low sand beach, backed for about half a mile by bare sa\ld dunes of all imaginable shapes, gradually increasing in height as tliey rf'eede from the cmt1:1t until about one mile from it, when defined ridges and 11ills appear, the latter reaching au anm1ge eJeration of about two huudred feet.. 'rhese are backed hy densely timbered ridges aud hills of i.,rreater elevatfon, interspersed with many lakes and ravines and practically impenetralJle.

As then' stated, the stead;v rise of the watf'rs i11 these rivers, owing to the anmrnl frN;lwt, compel1ed l\fr.

During- tlH' highest water he prosecutetl tlie surYt>J around the cities of Portland, East Portland, a11d ~'1lbi11a. Later iu the season he went back again do·wr1 the Columbia as far as Willow Bar. The repreiseutation-of the shores of the riYer was limited to about a mile back from the water's t>,dge ou either side, Mr. Rockwell deemiug this a snfllcient border of topography to meet the ntieds of the work, Hw fundi-; for which were limited. In the cities of Portland, East Portlancl, and Albina :t snflicfrnt number of the principal streets were determined to enable a plot of the city surveyor's map to be i·educed to the 1-10000 scale of t}ie topographic sheet. On the Portland or west sille of the \Yillamette the survey was continued to include the summits of the first range of hill8 back of the city. The seaf10n's work is included in two topographic sheets, one on a scale of 1-20000, which joins the topograpliical work pnwiomdy done by Mr. Hockwell from 'Willow Bar up the ColumQia to n .point a mile aborn tlw mouth of tile Willamette, and up that river to the head of Swan Island, and the other, on a scale of 1-10000, embracing the cit.y of Portland, ex;teQds from the hl:}ad of Swan Island to the south limit of that cit.Y·

through the American cornml, all necessary authority to land <1Il the shores of Britisll Colmnhia for the purposes of the snrn'>y. By invitation of J,ieut. Commander A. S. Snow, U. S. N., Assistant Coast autl Geodetk Survey, commanding tlle steamer Hassler, .Mr. Colonna took up his quarters on board, the parly 011 the Hassler being at that time eng"ag-ed in erecting signals at the east end of the strait. "-ii 11 the advantages of trausportaiion thus afforded, he became acquainted with the couutr~· as far we,,,r, as Esquimalt Ilarbor. He then left tlw Hassler and took a trip 011 a tug to study the south shore a" far as Neeah Bay. Sonic meam; of transportation it became now absolutely necessary to li:we at his sole control in order to \'isit the more inaccessible placel'I on the lower strait. A steamer of some kind would have been exceedingly desirable, but none being aYailable at a reasonable cost, Mr. Colonna hired a fislling-boat, twenty-six feet long, aud made arrangements to Jim 011 !Joal'd. I<'rorn the line Dungeness-Discornry, at the eastern end of the strait. be carried tl·e rccomrnis:~m11ce to the line Slip Point-Sherringham Point, and was preparing to take tbe next step weist, when, on the 9th of August, from tbe combined effects of OYerwork and an accident, he fonnd hirnst·lf paralyzed, and was taken to the hospital at Victoria. · In this emergency the arri ml of Assistant Pratt with the schooner Yukon was exceedinp:ly opportune; he was followed in a few days by Mr. T. P. Borden, who reported for duty as Aid. Messrs. Pratt and Borden prosecuted the reconnaissance with vigor to the westward i11 the Yu kcm. Un the 12th of September the vei,isel got under wa;r for the lower straiti,i, but, owi1Jg to ealm weather aud strong tidal curreuts, Yery slow progress was made in gettiug from IJOiut to poiut. Often, when nearing the shore, the wiud would die out, aud then there was great danger of shipwreck by being carried ou tlrn rol\kS hy the 8trong aud treacherous tidal cmrreuts, running, iu &ome instances, as much as fiye or six miles an hour. On oue occasion the Yukon was carried witliiu twenty fret of the rocks at Beecbey Head before lwr anchors would llold. Mr. Pratt ohiserYes tliat duriug a ~Teat portiou of tbe time there is a ,·err hea,·y swell mlling in the straits, produci11g a heayy surf 011 the shores. These being mostl:y rorky, ~Tt'at i<kill aud judgment are ueedecl iu managi11g a larn1ing in a boat. To insure safety in lauding, a steam ye,,;. sel should be used. In a steamer the ,,::hore can be. approaclied within one-third of a 1uile, and a reserve boat be held in readiness to render assistance to a landing party in case of acc~i1le11t. During the ebb and fl.ood tides in ruauy parts of the strait there are tide-rip,,, which often cover large areas. These rips heing compust>d of irregular and contradictory currents and efldi~s, combined with a hear.r chop sea, small craft, aud especially open boats, are ahrn.rs i11 great peril in them and am often lost. Mr. Pratt.'s whole experience attested the truth of tbe statement of Uaptain H.icharcls, H. N .. iu the Vancouver Island Pilot, who sa;ys of Juan de Fuca Strait that" from it:s gN>graphical position it is liable to all those sudden vicissitudes of weather common to high 11orthern latitmles, arnl in few parts of the world is the caution and vigilance of the na\'igator more called i11to aetiou than in entering it." There are no barbors west of Port Angelos on the A mericau side, although there are ~ewral anchorages suitable during moderate or Mntherly weather. On the Britii,ih side there is but oue harbor, Port San Juan, west of Bsqnimalt, and that is exposed to southwest storms. Becher Bay should not be made in lieavs weather, the tidal currents paBt its entrance being uncertain :rncl often dangerous. The reconnaissance, conducted by Assistants Colonna aml Pratt with the aid of .Mr. 1lonle11, was completed by the middle of October, a scheme of triangulation having been <leYelopt·d from a proposed base m1 Whidbey Island to Cape :Flatte.ry light, ou Tatoosb Island, on tl1e A mnican side, and to Bonilla. Point, 011 Va11couver lisland, British Columbia. The Yukou was lai1l np at Victoria, British Columbia, October 31. At this tiwe Mr. Colonna was still in tlic ho!ipital, hut a:s soon as be had sufficiently reco>ered to bear removal he took up his quarters on boar<l the Yu'lrnn, and by the end of the year was ahle to attend to office work. A comprehensive report has been submitted by himself and Mr. Pratt, exhibiting the Mn1lition of the work at date (January 27, 1885), suggesting the mo1>t practicable methods for its Pxecution, stating the modes of tra11sportation most desirable, and giving estimates for its cost. Mr. Colonna bas presented also a special report of the work during its earlier stages. In lhi$

he expresses his thanks to Mr. Pratt for the spirit in which lie came to his assistance in time of need, for the skill and energy with which 1.JP prosecuted tlie survey, and for his kindness and consideration to himself personally. l\lr. Borden's sen·ice.s ai; aid were efficient and faithful. Towards the end of Ma;v, 1885, iu accordance with instructions, Mr. Colonna turned over the Yuko11 and all Coast and Geodetic Survey· prnperty on board of her in his charge to Mr. Piat.t, and proceeded to Washington, stopping at Olympia, Washington Territory, long enough to acquaiut Assistant J. J. Gilbert l'especting the couditiou of the work 011 the Strait of Fuca, and to deliver to him such data as would enable him to continue it. On ,June 8, he reported for duty at the office. Hydrogmphic survey u.f the Strait of Fuca.-At tlle beginning of the fiscal year, as mentioned iu the last, annual report, a, hydrograpbic survey in the Strait of Fuca was in active progress under the direction of Lieut. Uommander A. S. Snow, As8istant Coast and Geodetic Sunt>y, commanding the steamer Hassler. The lines run by the ship began in the near Yicinity of W hidbey Island, and were carried across the strait, at intervals of two miles, as far :is Pillar Point. In addition to these lineH normal to the coast, two lines were run parallel to it; the various bauks aud shoals were developed., and close soundiugs were nrnde in the vicinity of Puget Sou11d to connect with the inshore hydrogrnpbic work of' previous seasons. The boat work was carried on from New Dungeuess light we.stward to Pillar Point; the line8 hei11g from one-third to one-fourth of a mile apart, with clol'er intervals wherever it seemed requisite. These lines were run out to a depth of twenty fathoms. ~Want of time preveuted anything being done hy tlrn boati; on the northern side of the strait excPpt 011 Salmon Bauk, which was quite closel.Y and thoroughly sounded. Mncl1 trouble was experienced in gettinl!' tl.Je boats through the kelp, which grows very quickly in many )ocalitiPs, and the outP.r limit of which, as a rule, is in six fathon111 water. No dangers were fouJHl outside of this kelp. Lieutenant-Commander Snow gives in his report full details iu regard to the harbors and anchorages within the limits of hit1 hydrographic sheet. He observes tl1at all of the anchorages are exposed to the easterly gale&, bnt that these apparently do not blow home at Port Angl'lo1<, a1ul from all other winds this harbor is admirably protected. He had been at anchor in the porr, when a heav,y southeast gale was reported by _telegraph twenty miles to the eastward, but with no indication of bad weather at hi11 anchorage except a moderate swell, low barometer, and threatening sky. There is excellent holding ground, a1Hl good allchorage eau he fom\d anywhern on the southern side of the harbor. Tile mountains of the Olympic Range, he remarks, haYe 110 special characteristic which can he <lescribed for the assistance of strangers navigating the strait, nor do the bluffs aloug tlw coast possess any peculiar features except in a few localities. At Pillar Point is a high round-top1wd hill, terminating in a high bare rock. Striped Peak, on the east sirle of Crescent Bay, is anotlll'r conical hill, thickly wooderl, and several hundred feet high. It has been conspicuous from a land slide, but the traces of this are gradually disappearing. 'J'he8c two points stand out quite pr11:11ineutly iu the strait, the shore between them tending inward. 'fo obtain a plane of reference for the soundings, tide-gauges were pnt up at New Dungt·1w,-<S (jnst inside or the light), at Port Angelos, and at Griffin Bay, San JUJ,11 Island. Bench-marl,s wern established for each gauge. Day and night observations for a lunar month were taken at Port Angelos. The gauge at this port was used for the greater part of the work, being more centrally located. Lieutenant.Commander Snow observes that the tides, although following the general law for the Pacific coast, are very irregular, and frequently perplexed him in endeavoring to follow them. It often happened in Rort Angelos that there was uo perceptible moveme11t on tlle gauge for five or six hours, and but a few inches change throughout the day. He suggests that a buoy on Salmon Bank would be a valuable aid to navigation, as the ma.rks usunlly relied upon to keep clear of it cannot be seen at tiwes when a buoy would be visible. Respecting the currents in Fuca Strait, Lieuteuant-Comrnander Snow remarks that they are very complex in their mm'ements, and that observations of them t-0 be of any value should extend over a long period, and be taken at regular intervals. As a rule, on the south side of the' strait, with the flood tide, a vessel will be set slightly inshore of her compass course, while with the ebb, a set oif·sbore is noticed. Great caution should be used in the vicinity of the coast, especially

near Race Rock, Point Wilson, and other projecting points where tide-rips are marked, and where a small chang-e in position will make much difference in the set of the current. In the vicinity of the banks the currents split in various directions, and heavy tide-rips are common, especially with fresh westerly winds. ·work was discontinued October 17, and, in pursuance of instructions, the Hassler steamed to Victoria, British Columbia, to take ou board the American consul at that port and convey him to Port Townsend, Seattle, and Nceah Bay, ·wash. T., returning thence with the consul to Victoria. This service having been performed, the Hassler left Esquimalt, British Columbia, on October 28, and arrived at San J<,raucisco November 2. The zeal and iutelligeuce iu the execution of duty displayed by the naval officers attached to the part.v elicitetl the warm approbation of their commander. Signals were erected and observations made by Lieut. G. Blocklinger a11d by Ensigns W. V. Bronaugh, F. l\I. Bostwick, and W. P. White. Records were kept by Passed Assistant Surgeon W. S.

Hydrographic sun·cys in ~m"thea.vtern A la.Yka.-At the date at which this report closes, Lieut. Richardson Clo,·er, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Carlile P. Patterson, was actively engaged in hydrographic surveys in the waters of Southeastern Alaska. The Patterson left San Francisco April 25, 1885, and arrived at Port Simpson l\fay 17. After lauding material and working party for the steam tender Lively, and ahm a party for astronomical work, she proceeded the same day to Sitka to deliver a telegram from the Secretary of the Navy to the commanding officer of the U. 8. steamer Pinta. Un her return to Port Simpson l\lay 261 the J,ively and working 1·arties were transferred to Ward's Oo>e, and on June 1 hydrographic work was begun on a sheet including Clarence Strait and the neighboring waters. At the outset much difficulty was experienced in finding a site for a preliminary base line, the shores being densely wooded to high-water mark. After a thorough reconnaissance it was found necessary to go into Tongass Narrows, where a stretch of half a mile of beach was obtaiued at low water. The dense forests covering the approaches to the shores and the tops of the mount· ains made it impracticable to carry out a system of primary triangulation with long lines, and a series of small triaugles had to be laid out, with frequent large signals at high-water mark. Lieutenant Clover reports that the hydrographic characteristics of the locality are either very deep water or sunken rocks, which are frequently met with, and are exceedingly dangel'ons to navigation A staff gauge for tidal observations was put up in Ward's Gove June 5, and ob8ervations ta.ken day and night until Jane 17. A similar gauge was put up at the same time in Karta Bay anchorage, and by simultaneous observations of four low and four high waters the curve of this gauge was connected with that at Ward's Cove, and found to be the same. At Karta Bay, tidal obt>ervations were conlioned till ,June 28. The plane of reference for the soundings, as determined by a mean of the lower low waters observed during twenty-three days, was found to be 1.57 feet above the zero of the staffs. The extreme rise and fall observed was twenty-two and one-quarter feet. H. Ex. _18--9

Reconnaissance for e,xtending the primary triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel from West Virginia into Kentucky and Ohio.-Under the heading of Section Ill in this report an account has been given of the reconnaissaucecarried on by .Assistant A. T. Mosman from stations in West Virginia westward near the thirty-ninth parallel into Kentucky and Ohio. Mr. Mosman was aided by Mr. J.E. McGrath. The reconnaissance was actively prosecuted until December 22, notwithstanding many interrn1>tions from sewre cold and storms. The scheme of triangulation resulting will be adopted for continuing the transcontinental geodetic work westward. Occupation of stations in contin'IUltion of the triangulation of tlie State of Tennessee.-During the fiscal year the triangulation of the State of Tennessee waR advanced by the occupation of four stations in the western pa.rt of the State by Prof. A. H. Buchanan, Acting Assistant. Instructions tor .field work were received July 9, 1884, and preparations were at once made for occupying station Deadening, about twelve miles northwest of Spring City, Rhea County. The establishment of camp, the posting of beliotropers, &c., was completed by July 21, and on the 22d observations were begun. Smoke and haze were very prevalent, and it was not till August 25 that the work at this station could be completed. The party was then mo>ed to Owen station, two and a half miles northwest of Sweetwater, Monroe County. .At this point observations were begun August 31, and completed September 19. Hoose station, twelve miles northeast of Knoxville, was uext occupied. Observations at'' Honse" were finished November 5. The last station occupied in 1884 was Melton, near Burns' Mill, Roane County. At Melton the party spent seventeen d~s, but the atmosphere was so smoky that during most of that time it was impossible to see ten miles, and but two days and a half of clear working

'r. ~Iosman in November aml December, 1884, for the extension of the transcontinental triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel westward into Ohio and Kentucky. The most westward point reached in the reconnaissance was West Union, Adams County, Ohio, near which a station was selected, connecting witb Peacb Mount, Ohio, and Cberry Ridge, Ky. Continvation of the triangulation of the State of Ohio.-Geodetic operations in the State of Ohio were. resumed, under instructions, by Prof. R. S. Devol, Acting Assistant, ear1y in July, 1884. On account of delay in tlie passage of the appropriation act, and the smallness of the allotment, the season was a brief one. Arrangements were made by Professor De,·ol to take the field with as lit· tle delay as possible; tripods and observing scafl:olds were built at Buck Hill and Brown stations, and upon their completion the party was organized at Barton station, about eight miles south· west of the town of Logan, in Hocking County. Observations at Barton were continued till August 30, wheu field work was closed. The weather was uufifforable during tlw greater pflrt of the period ; a severe drought prevailed, with very hazy atmosphere, till August 21. Six stations were observed from Harton, and the total number of angular measurements was four hundred and eighty. Earthen pyramids for uuderground marks and marble posts for surface marks were put down at Brown and Buck Hill stations, and rua.rhle posts for reference marks at Barton station. Measurements there will be resumed at tbe close of the fiscal year. Ocm1pa,tion of stations in continuation of the triangulation of the State of lndiana.-Uesults of the field operations for the extension of the triangulation of tbe State of Indiana under the direc· tion of Prof. J. L. Campbell, Acting Assistant, show the completion of measurements in the first qua1lrilatnu.f, the occupatiou of two stations in the second quadrilateral, and a reconnaissance begun for the selection of stations in a third quadrilateral. Four stations were occupied for angular measurements during the season-Blind As:ylum Six-Mile Switch, Sims, aud Lutz. By the occupation of the thre~ stations first named, the t1urveys of the i:states of Indiana and Kentucky have been brought into close geodetic counection. Lutz is a station of the second quadrilateral north of the Ohio River. It is a few miles south of the town of Charlestown, Clark County, and is less than half a mile east of the line of the Ohio and MisRissippi Railroad. At this station it was ·found necessary to erect a. tripod and tower, forty feet in height. Tbe other new station selected, but not occupied this season, was named Haystack. It is a little to the west of the town of Bennetti.;;ville, in Clark County; bas au approximate elevation of nine hundred and ten feet above sea-level, and is a prominent and well-known part of the elevatious knowu as "The Knobs." Special care was taken to secure these litations by underground and surface markings. !<'or the undergrouud marks a one-t>ightb-inch copper wire was firmly set in cement in a black bottle, and the bottle placed in a teu-incb stone tubing and filled round firmly with gravel and cerueut two feet below the surface. Four limestone pillars were emplo~·ed for the surface marks, one loeated directly over the center of the underground mark, and the three others six feet distant from the center, to the north, tiouth, and east: These pillars are two feet long, dressed at top to five inches square, and show about four inches above the surface.

Extension of the primary triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel casticard across the State of lllint>is.-At the beginning of the fiscal sear the primary triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel in the State of Illinois had been advancfd by Assistant George A. Fairfield nearly to the eat!tern boundary of the State. Before the first 8tation could be occupied it became necessary to erect tripod and scaffold signals of sennty-five and eighty feet iu height, one at Honey Ureek station in Illinois and one at Summit station, Indiana. All preparations were completed bs July 12, and the party of observation went into camv at Claremout station, which is situated four miles east and two miles north of Olney, Richland County. On August 5, Assistant J. S. Bradford reported for duty in the partJ-, and on the 24th, Extra Obsen'er J. B. Boutelle joined it. Observations at Claremont were .finished August 26, and a day or two later camp was mo\·ed to Hunt City station, whieh is about a mile northeast of the railroad station of the same name on the Danvilie, Oluey and Ohio River Railroad. Twelve days sufficed to complete the work at Hunt City, and by September 26 the party was established in camp at Belle Air station, twelve miles south of Martinsville, ou the Vaudalia lfailroad. A week of rainy weather dela)'ed operations, but as only three directions had to be determined from this point, the occupation of the station was completed October 7, and on the 11th camp was pitched at Honey Creek station, about five miles northwest of Flat Rock, a small town on the Cairo division of the ·wabash, Saint Louis and Pacifie Railroad. The next and last station occupied during the seasonwa8 Summit, which is situated about nine miles northeast of Vincennes, Ind. Ooservations were begun November 4, but delays occurred, owing to the bad condition of the atmosphere and accidents to the night-observing-lights. On :November 10, in pursuance of instructions, field work was closed for the season. At three of the !oltations occupied signals had been erected in 1879 by the United States engi. neers, h.Y whom a triaugulation had been carried 1:1outhward from stations of the Lake Survey. Mr. Fairfield found these signals to be in a good state of preservation. They bad been built in the most substantial manner, and by oecup;yiug thew he was enabled to make a very t!atisfactory connection between tbe Coast and Geodetic Survey transcontinental triangulation aud that of the Engineer Corps, U. S. A. These stations were: Claremont, where the instrument was mounted at a height of eighty foet; Hunt City, where it was seventy-five feet, and Belle Air, where it was one hundred feet above the ground. Two of the lines in Mr. Fairfield's scheme, Denver to Claremont and Hunt City to Belle .Air, were identical with lines of the Engineer Survey.

running lines of leveliug of precision from a point 011 the transcontinental line of lernls towards MobiJe, Assistant J.B. Weir }lroceeded, under inst,ructions, to Odin, :Marion County, Illinois, and on the 10th of April, 1885, began work from a bench-mark established by Assistant Braid in 1883. To make the starting point more secure, Mr. Weir established another permanent bench-mark at Odin. From Udiu the line of levels followed the track of the Illinois Central Railroad, and the trains of that road were used as a means of daily transportation to and from the localities of work. At Yilla Ridge, Pulaski County, twelve miles i1orth of Cairo, where field operatious were closed J uue 5, two permanent bench-marks were established. Between Odin and Villa Ridge, a distance of one hundred and nine miles, fourteen permanent bench-marks were established. Tbe method of observing was tbe same as bitberto pursued i11 tl1is work. Two parallel lines were run simultaneously and in tlrn same direction with t>W,parate rods, these rods being placed at difterent <listances from tbe hwel. In order to eliminate any cumulative e1-ror that might result from running constantly in one direction, alternate portions of the line, of ten or fifteen miles in length, were run in opposite directions, care beiug taken to ha Ye the hack and fore sights as nearly equal as possible. The original aud duplicate records of the work have been transmitted to the office. Mr. Weir, in his report, acknowledges the effective services rendered by Mr. John Nelsou, who served as Aid iu the party. Occupation of stations in continuation of the triangula,tfon of the State of Wisconsin.-ln continuation of tlJe triangulatio11 of tbe State of Wi&consin, Prof: John E. Da,·ies, .Actiug Assistant, took the field under iu:;trnctions at tile earliest date at which the apJlropriation llecame available. B~tween July 21 and October ~8, wheu tlie season closed, four station:; were occupit>d iu the SQUtbeastem part of the State, and a connection was established with the triangulation of the U. S. Lake Survey. High tripods were built at Lebanon, Delafield, and Geneva Lake preparatory to the occupa~ion of the first station, Oakland. Following this, statio11s Delafield, Erin, and Pleasant Springs were occupied iu successiou, aud the occupation of station Lebauou attempted, but without success, owing to tile Yibration of the tall observing tripod aud scaffold in the prPvailing high winds. An effort will be made next year to gh·e greater steadiuess to this structure. As the lines Lebanon-Erie-Delafield are all well established and adjusted lines of the Lake Survey, based upon carefully measured and fundamental line!' at Fo11d-du·lac aud Chicago, a close coincidence of results upou tLose lines would be highl,y gratif,ying, and was so. as far as the observations obtained would indicate. Professor Davies devotes much space in his report to the recommendation of methods which appear to him highly desirable for gr~ater efilcienuy and economy in the prosecution of the :sun-ey, and for the security of the titations already determined, especially those borderiug upon the States of Iowa and Illinois, and upon !Jake Michigan.

the trauscoutiuental work, to modify Mr. Granger's i11strnctious, and to limit him to the occupation of two stations, Bowler and Berry, in Western Missouri, from which could be determined th~ first two .stations of the scheme to the westward, Marty and Haskin. Bowler station is on a small ele,·ation, situaterl about two miles and a half southwest of the town of Lee's Summit, Jackson County, Missouri. Station Berry is about one mile and a half west of the town of Belton, Cass County, Missouri . .At Bowler the theodolite was elevu.ted twenty-seven feet above ground, and five primary and eight tertiary directions were determined. At Belton the elevation of the theodolite was twenty-four feet. Obseffations were made upon four primary aud six tertiary objects, and by September 1 all of the work required at the two stations was finh1hed. Before disbanding his party, Mr. Granger visited stations Ha.skin arnl Marty to seetire tliem by permanent markiugs. The tertiary objects deterrniuell were church spires in the towns of Harrisonville, Lee's Summit, Westport, Kansas City, and Independence.

Towards the end of May, Assistant Edwin Smith, who bad been placed in general charge of the work, and in immediate charge of one of the primar.v parties, had determined the longitude of Little Rock, Ark., and hitd made the uecessary arrangerueuts for an exchange of telegrapl1ic sig1mls for longitude with Assistant C. H. Sinclair, ill charge of the other primary party at Kansas Oity, Mo. On the nig·hts of .May 30, .'31, June 1 and 4 successful exchanges of longitude signals were obtained by the two obserYers. They then changed stations, Mr. Smith proceeding to Kansas City aud Mr. Sinclair to Little Rock. In the new position of observers the determiua.tion of the longitude of Kansas City was completed by exchanges on the night!!. of June 11, 12, 18, and 19. The results for longitude of the primary points being freed from the effect of personal equation by the exchauge of observer~, no special ollservationis were needed for personal equation between Messrs.

Continuation of reconnaissance and triangulation in Utah, near the thirty.ninth pa.rallel.-.Assistant William EimlJeck was engaged at the beginning of the fiscal year, as mentioned iu my last annual report, in a reconnaissance for the site of a base line in Central Utah that should be so located a8 to be available for connection with the primary transcontiuental triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel. This work involrnd a reconnaissance of the mountaiuis northeastward from Ogden, whiel· was subsequently carrie1l into the valley of the river Jordan and to the foot-spur mountains bordering that valley to the east. Mr. Ji~imheck had in Yiew also the extension of the geooetic scheme northward from the line Ibepab-Mount Nebo. Having brought these examinations to a close eal'ly iu July, and submitted for official decision two proposed. locations for 11rimary bases, be 11ext carded a reconuaissance into-the San Pitch Mountains, between Jua.h and San Pete Valleys, and tl1ence to the Wasatch Plateau opposite the towns of Manti and Ephraim, San Pete Connty. .All of this reconnaissance was virtually brought to a satisfactory conclusion by the end ot' July, and the results duly reported.

bility of the points of thP great quadrilateral, Ibepah (or Gm1iute), Nebo, Pilot Peak, and Ggden, and a scheme of triangulation connecting the base-lines referred to with the main work. In August Mr. Eimlieck submitted for consideration a scheme of telegraphic longitude stations covering a section of the arc of the thirty-ninth parallel frow the meridian of Colorado Springs to the Pacific coast. Upon the receipt in that month of telegraphic instructions approving and adopting the .Juab base, he proceeded to orgauize a full party fur the occupation of Scipio, one of the Rtation~ connecting with the south end of that base, and for the erection of the necessar.v signals to he observed upon at Oedar, Levan, San Pete, and South Jnab. The plan of occupying Ihepah station was abandoned for the time being, owing to the ad,·anced state of the sea.son and the imusiial isolation aud inaccessibility of that mountain from the eastward. Upon the 16th of August an adYanced part._y '"as dispatched to Scipio station, a mountain upwards of fhe thousaml feet in height, for the purpose of opening a trail for the pack animals, and by the end of that month the party was encamped near the summit, and tLe !ltatioll was in readiness to receive the instruments. It was not, howeYer, till the atmosphere bad been cleared by a snow storm on the 10th of September that obserYations of horizontal directions could be begun. Heliotropes had been established at Nebo, vYasatch, and Mount Tushar; at all other stations fiat, rectangular, and target-like signals were erected, such as had pro,·ed most efl'ectiYe as regards Yisibilit:y on former occa8ious upon lines of fifty or sixty miles long. At Scipio station the work included, besides obsen·ations of horizontal direction, observations of zenith distanceR, both absolut\' and 1li1ferential, a complete set of magn<'tic and meteorological observations, and a rongh topographical survey of the mountain, eo\~eri1Jg an ar\'a of ;it least ten square miles. Before the close of field operations complete sets of magnetic obserYations, exteuding in each case oYer three days, were made at Deseret Railway station, Utah Central Railroad, and at Salt. Lake Cit;r, where the Temple Block magnetic station was occupied to obtaiu tLe regular annual set of observations, this being deemed one of the base stations of the magnetic surny. At stations Nephi and Provo, which had been established and occupied t11e year before, the magnetic dip only was observed. Field work was closed finally for the seasou in October, and, under instructions, Mr. Eimbeck proceeded to Washington and reported for duty at the office. The Aid in bis party, Mr. George F. Bird, who bad served creditably since being assigned to it, July 23, was dt>t:icbed and ordered to Kansas Cit~'· Mr. Bird bad made all of the magnetic observations, the measurements of absolute zenith distance, anil the topographical s11r.,ey of Scipio station. Jwing to the shortness of tbe fieltl season and unfavorable weather, the experiments with the "selenotrope," which Mr. Eimbeck ha<l undertaken for the first time the preceding season to teRt the practicability of using the moon's light for geodetic night-signals, were uot resumed, but will be as opportunity offers. While engaged on office work during the remainder of the fiscal _year Mr. Eimbeck submitted designs for a 11ew form of base apparatus, and designed and reported also a new form of suspension for pendulums used for determinations of gra\"ity. Towards the end of June he received orders to prepare for the resumption of field work in Oeutra.1 Utah.

Considerations based upon the desirabilit;y of improving the methods of photographic registry employed at Los Angeles led to the issue of instructions to l\Ir. Baker to proceed by way of Toronto, Canada, aud obtain from .Mr. Charles Carpmael, director of the Magnetic Ouservatory of the Dominion Government, permission to inspect the processes of photographic registry and development employed in that establishment.

On bis journey east. Mr. Raker availed himself ofa 8hort stay at Kalamazoo, Mich., to determine the magnetic declination at that place. Arriving in Toronto, August 25, Mr. Baker, finding the Director of the Observatory absent, was presented to Mr. James roung, his assistant, who bad speciaJ charge of the magnetic work and flw photographic processes, and was indebted to bis courtesy for the priYilege of examining the observatory and mauy of the details of its operations. The results of this examination, and of studies and experimeJital inYestigations made during the winter and spring in \Yasliingtou, with valuable aid and suggestions from Assistant Andrew Braid, led, iu April, to a recommendation that argentic gelatino-bromide paper should be substituted for the bromo-iodirle of silver paper tben in use at Los Angeles. The change was effected, as stated mHJer the heading of Section X, on the 1st of .Tun(', 1885, ftml the improvement in tbe character of tbe photographic traces has been very gratifJ·ing.
REPORTS IN REGARD TO THE SUROFFICES AT :BOSTON,

YORK, AND PHILADELPlIIA.

Suboffice at Boston.-The relation of Assistant Heury MitchPll to c1wtain harbor commissions in Massachusetts awl other ~ ew England States led many years ago to the establishment, of work iug rooms in Boston for himself and party. These rooms, two iu number, came e\·entually to be a place for the collection of data, and for the computation of the results of physical surveys, and in 1881, under the rie"- regulatious issiied in tlJat year, were designated as a "suboffice." Those that seek this suboffice, Mr. Mitchell reports, are mostly professional men, interested in cmnmerce or navigation, and in the studies of pbyRical bytlrogrnphy there pursued ; it is not, pmctically, a source of geueral information. He submits for consideration tbe conclusion that in view of the success of tlie work, the suboffice in Boston has been rconomical!y conducted, and under favomble conditions. Suboffece at Sew York.-At the solicitation of the Chamber of Commerce, the Maritime Excliauge, arn.1 the Produce Exchauge of the city of New York, a suboffice was established in that city in May, 1885. The use of the buililing formerly occupied by tlie Produce Exchange, on Pearl, and \Yater, and \Vllitl'llall, and Moore Streets, was granted by that body free of charge to the Government. In view of the detailed resurvey of New York Harbor and its approaches, which was then in progress, and of the advantage of having a general headquarters where chiefs of parties could meet to arrange details of co-operation, anll where charts of the harbor co nhl be made accessible for reference, the Superintendent accepted with thanks tbe li!Jeral offer of the Produce Exchange, and placed tlie arrmgcment and care of the office rooms in charge of Acting Assistant Francis .T. Palmer. It was believed also that the value of the work done by the Survey woulil havo a wider recognition an<l more extended appreciation by the establishment of a suuoffice in the most important maritime port of the United States. At the <late at which this report closes, part of Mr. Palmer's time was, occupied, with the approval of the Superintendent, in supervising the construction of a series of models, in relief, of the harbor aml its approaches upon scales of three, eleven, and twenty-four inclies to the mile, respfctively. The expense of making these models was borne by members of the committee on harbor and shipping of the Cliamber of Commerce. For tlie informati<m of this committee Mr. Palmer had been previously engaged some months in examining and collating the various s11rveys -0f the harbor, and in collecting and arranging all of tbe publications which could be found bearing upon the subject. 'i'he opening of this suho.ffice has developed the interest of all classes of the citizens of New York in the care, preservation, and improvement of the harbor, and has showu that they a.re heartily in sympatli;y with it~ thorough resurvey. Suboffioe at Philadelphia.-The use of a large and well-lighted room in the new post-office building in Philadelphia having been kindly accorded t-0 the Survey, mainly through the efforts of Assistant 8. C. McCorkle, the opportunity was taken of suppl_ying a want long folt in some of the leading sea-ports, namely that of bringing the work and the results of the Survey into closer relations with the commercial and maritime community, and of establishing a bureau of iufoi·mation, where a supply of the charts and other publications could be kept for reference, and where inqui0

ries in regard to the operations of the work could either be answered or referred to the proper officers. At the beginning of the fiscal year, Assistant McOorkle was instructe'tl to take charge of this suboffice, and he has submitted a report of its operations to June 30, 1885. Applications for information have been received, and inquiries answered from the Department of Surveys of the city of Philadelphia, from the Water Department, the Board of Port Wardens, the Maritime Exchange, and the Board of Trade. Also from the officers of the Engineer Corps, U.S. A., of the Light-House Board, and Signal Service. Moch advantage is derived from having the offices of these several Government bureaus under the same roof. Those assistants of the Surve;v whose duty brought them to the city were afforded facilities for doing office work, and their instruments and records were stored temporarily, free of cost, in a fire-proof building. Assistants Henry Mitchell, R. M. Bache, C. M. Bache, C. T. Iardella, R. E. Halter, Edwin Smith, F. W. Perkins, H. L. Marindin, C.H. Sinclair, and C.H. Van Orden availed themselves from time to time of the~ facilities. During the sessions of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in September 1884, and during the period of the International Electrical Exhibition, in the autumn of that year, invitations were extended to the delegates and to the exhibitors to visit the office. Many responded and showed great interest in the charts~ Coast Pilots, and tide-tables, and particularly in the model of the Depths of the Sea in the Bay of North America and Gulf of .Mexico, which the Superintendent had sent for a time to the suboffice before placing it in the New Orleans Exposition. A description of this model, with illustrative sketch, was given in Appendix No. 17 to the last annual report. Mr. McCorkle expresses his belief that the interest of the public in the work of the Survey has been greatly advanced by the establishment of the suboffice in Philadelphia. Okarge of the exhibit of the Ooast and Geodetic Survey at the New Orlea,ns Exposition.-A special building for the use of the Government having been erected by the managers of the World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition held at New Orleans in 1884-1885, arrangements were made by the Treasury Department for exhibits by several of its Bureaus. Preparations were begun in the autumn of 1884 at this office for sending to New Orleans an exhibit which should illustrate the instruments and apparatus used in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and the reflults of its work. Occasion was at the same time taken to prepare for transmission set.~ of Standards of Weight and Measure. These preparations, under the general supervision of Assistant C. O. Boutelle, in charge of the office, were directed in detail by Assistant Henry W. Blair, who bad been assigned to the charge of the exhibit of the Survey. Mr. Blair had arrived at Nashville early in December, having, witli characteristic energy, started southward before having fully recovered from the e:ffocts of se,·ere illness. At Nashville he WM prostrated by an attack which proved fatal in a few days. AssiElt· ant George W. Dean was at once instructed to proceed to New Orleans, where be arrived December 17, and reported to Mr. William F. MaeLennan, the representative of the Treasury Department in the Board of United States Executive Officers. Dr. James J. Clark, of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures, had already arrived and co-operated with Mr. Dean in the arrangements for the disposition of the exhibit, the space for which, though limited, wa11 favorably located near the main entrance on the west side of the Government building. The articles forming the exhibit were in place by the middle of January, 1885. They were olassified under the heads of geodesy, astronomy, topography, bydrography, magnetics, miscellane01u, publications and results, and weights and measures. The instruments and apparatus -used in geodetic work were represented by the primary six· meter oompensating base a.pparatm~, by a four-meter secondary base apparatus, by two theodolites one sixteen inch and one eight inch, by reconnoitering telescopes, by heliotropes, by a geodesic le.vel and a gradienter, and by signal lamps used for night observations. The astronomical branch of the work was illustrated by a oomplete set of instruments used in detmmining latitnde and longitude, and included a zenith t,eJeseope, a forty-six inch transit, H. Bx. 18---10

74

a prismatic transit, an electric chronograph, a break-circuit chronometer, telegraphic key-board, and apparatus for determining personal equation. Topographic work'was represented by a plane-tat>le complete in all of its parts and a telemeter rod; hydrographic work by a sextant, and optical densimeter, a deep-sea thermometer, and a self-registering tide-gauge. The instruments illustrating the magnetic branch of the Survey were a unifilar magnetometer . and a dip-circle. Under the head of" miscellaneous" were shown a pendulum, a geodesic lflvel and rod, a maximum and minimum thermometer, a stoppered level, and a tripod and scaffold model for an observing signal. The publications of the Survey were illustrated by a set of the volumes of annual reports and by copies of scientific papers, by volumes of the Coast Pilots for the Atlantic and Pacific coast.a, by copies of tide tables; and by a catalogue of upwards of six hundred charts, with specimen copies of charts on the various scales of publication. Also 1ty a model of the Depths of the Sea in the Bay of North America and Gulf of Mexico. A description of this model, with sketch, is given in Appendix 17 to the report ;for 1884. Complete sets of standard weights and measures, according to the English system, as ordinarily used in the United States for commercial purposes, were exhibited; also a complete set of standards of weight and measure of the metric system, as legalized by act of C011gress. Two com parators were shown, both for comparisons of end measures ; one a vertical comparator, for the comparisons of end measures with a working standard during adjustment, the other a refle,cting comparator, used for final comparisons of standards of length. Several hundred copies of a pamphlet which had been prepared at the oftice, descriptive of the Coast and Geodetic Survey exhibit, were distributed to visitors who evinced special interest in the character and progress of the work. Assistant Dean has submitted a full report of his connection with the exposition. Upon being relieved at his own request in March the charge of the exhibit was temporarily assigned to Dr. J. J. Clark, whose efficient and faithful services Mr. Dean acknowledges in his report. Towards the end of March Assistant 0. H. Boyd was assigned to duty at New Orleans in place of Mr. Dean, and remained till the close of the exposition, May 31. Voya,qe of the new steamer 0. P. Patterson from the Atlantic to the Pacific ooast.-Reference was made in the last annual report t-0 the construction of a steamer, the Carlile P. Patterson, specially designed for service on the Pacific coast. Before the Patterson left Hampton Roads for the Pacific, July 30, 1884, several trial trips were had with very satisfactory indications. Full reports have been submitted in regard to the results of her six months' voyage to the Pacific, the varying conditions of which compelled tests of her sea-going qualities much more complete and trustworthy than could be obtained in short trial trips. One of these reports has been prepared b;r Commander 0. M. Chester, U.S. N., Hydrographic Inspector, who superintended the construction of the steamer. From the other report, submitted ~y her commander, Lieut. Richardson Clover, U. S. N., has been condensed the following account of her voyage from Montevideo to Valparaiso: "The Patterson is of about eight hundred tons displacement, bark rigged, and capable of steaming nine knots on a consumption of eight tons of coal a day, and seven knots on four and one-half tons of coa1 a day in smoot.h water. Leaving Montevideo, Uruguay, at noon of November 6, 1884, with bunkers full and thirty tons of coal on deck, the steamer encountered a heavy gale near the mouth of the river, which compelled her to lay to the best part of a day, but though deeply loaded she rode quietly the heavy seas without taking anything but a little spray on deck. Variable weather with strong gales continued till the 14th, when the Straits of Magellan were entered with pleasant weather, the steamer passing between Virgin Reef and Nassau Rock." Lieutenant Clover gives a detailed account of his 1mssage through the straits, which at times was not unattended by danger. On the morning of the 17th, leaving his anchorage at an early hour, he passed down Famine Reach, and on rounding Cape Froward was met by a "tempest blowing down Froward Reach. With a favorable current, he struggled against the wind and sea from 11 a. m. till 5 p. m., hoping that the wind would go down enough to aJlow him to get to Wood's Bay, if not to Port Gallant, but during these six hours he made but five miles. The wind was so violent that the

sea would be picked up 'bodily, and whirled into :fine spray like a snow drift. At one time the wind got the vessel on the bow, and in order to keep her from running straight into the shore, her commander was compelled to back and wear short around, and came near losing both steam launches in bringing her again to the wind. Two days later tbe Patterson steamed through Victory Pass into the Pacific. While at anchor in the straits off Sandy Point, a town of fifteen hundred inhabitants, and the nearest town in the world to the South Pole, Captain Mendez, of the Argentine Navy, Military Governor of Staten Island and Terra del Fuego, visited the vessel, and from him much valuable information was obtained. Off the Pacific coast soundings were taken with the deep-sea machine, and reported dangers searched for. On November 29 the Patterson reached Talcahuano, Uhili, where she remained a week to refit, and December 7 left for Valparaiso, arriving at that port the next day. Immediately upon her arrfral at San Francisco, February 13, 1885, Lieutenant Clover began preparations for the bydrographic work which had been as1i1igned to him in Southeastern Alaska. A report of this work to the close of the fiscal year will be found under the heading of Section XII. Commander Chester states that in the qualities needed for effective service in Alaskan waters the Patterson has exceeded his most sanguine expectations. He bases this conclusion upon the reports received from her commander, and upon an elaborate discussion of her stability, the data for which were obtained by experimental trials at the Washington Navy-Yard. Tidal observa.tion.~ at Honolulu, Sandwich Isla.nds.-Records have been received at this office np to June 28, 1884, from the self-registering tide-gauge loaned in 1877 for the use of the Hawaiian Government Survey. This gauge is in operation at Honolulu, Oahu, under the supervision of the Superintendent of that Survey, and its records will be of much value in the discussion of the tides of the Pacific.
COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE.

The report of the Assistant in charge of the Office, Charles 0. Boutelle, esq., which appears in Appendix No. 4, and the accompanying reports of the chiefs of the office divisions, give all details relating to. the office operations during the fiscal year. Mr. Boutelle refers to the valuable contribution to our knowledge of the earth's magnetism made in .Assistant Schott's paper on the secular variation and geographical distribution of the magnetic dip and intensity in the United States for the epoch, 1885. 0. Also to the improvements effected in the engraving, electrotyping, and printing divisions under the charge of Assistant Ugden. Improved batteries were introduced for electrotype work, by means of which a more uniform and regular depmut of copper was obtained on the engraved plates, experiments having shown that a dynamo was not well ada1ited for this purpose. Increased facilities for the printers were obtained by an addition to the printing-office, affording better light and ventilation, and room for the new presses needed to meet the demand for charts. In the tidal division, the tide-predicting machine, invented by Professor Ferrel, bas proved to be of great value in reducing to a minimum the labor of computation. It was used largely in the preparation of the tide tables fur the Atlantic and Pacific coasts for 1886, which are now published. Mr. Boutelle alludes to some records of exceptional interest received in the office dnring the year from three widely separated tidal stations in the Pacific Ocean. At the selfregistering tide-gauges near San Francisco, at Kadiak in Alaska, and at Honolulu in the Sandwich Islands, the waves from the great Kr.J.katoa earthquake of August 26, to September 2, 1883, were distinctly recorded. Photographic copies of these records, which will be of value in deformining the movement of the earthquake waves, have been forwarded to the Royal Society, London. The preparation of original topographic sheets for reproduction by phot-0lithography bas ha,d specia.l a.ttention during the year in the Drawing Division and with marked success. All calls for information rt>£eived from the several Departments of the Government have been promptly met and requests from private organizations or individuals for transcripts from the . record& of the Survey have when practicable boon granted. A tabular statement of information

furnished is given in Appendix No. 3, and a table of the statistics of the Survey to the close of the fiscal year in Appendix No. 2. The measurement of the areas of all salt and fresh marsh upon the Atlantic Gulf coast, alluded to in the last annual report as having been undertaken at the request and for the use of the Commissioner of Agriculture, was completed, and the results communicated to that officer. Mr. Boutelle expresses bis great personal indebtness to Assistant H. W. Blair, who served as bis immediate executive officer and adviser from the beginning of the fiscal year till he was seizl'\d with an illness which after a few months proved fatal. A tribute to the memory of this able young officer appears in Appendix No. 18. Assistant C. H. Sinclair was temporarily assigned to duty in Mr. Blair's place, and served till relieved in Augnst, 1884, hy Subassistant F. H. Parsons, who remained on duty till the close of the fiscal year. Mr. William H. Dall re<1ig1Jed hi;;; pm;ition ai; an A<1sistaut in the Sru·vey in September, 1884, in order to devote himself more exclusivel~· to biological inveMtigation:;. Mr. Dall bad been conuected with the Survey since 1871. His explorations in Al~ska, resulting in bis work, "Alaska and its Resourees," published in 1870, and hiis asl!igument to dut;) on that remote coast for a number of years after lJis appoilltrmmt, caused biru to be recognized as an authority in all matters pertaining to the territory. In 1879 the Survey published as au Appendix to the Pacific Ooa.st Pilot an elaborate work, compiled and edited by him, on the meteorology of Alaska, with a partial list of maps and cbart8 relating to it and the adjacent regions, and an exhaustive bibliography. In 1883, under bis editorship, the Survey published the Alaska Coast Pilot, Part I, from Dixon Entrance to Yakutat Bay. For valuable aid iu the preparation of these works, Mr. Dall acknowledges bis obligations to Assistant Marcus Baker, who had served with him on the Alaskan peninsula. After Mr. Dall's resignation took effect, all Alaskan material in his hands was turned over to Mr. Baker, and by direction of the Superintendent he was charged with the revision of charts and sailing directions resulting from bydrographic reconnaissances in the Alexander Archipelago. He was occupied also during the winter and spring with tidal investigations and special correspondence relating to the tides. In October he was instructed to visit Sandy Hook automatic tide-gauge and restore its efficiency, and in February, 1885, he prepared a preliminary report upon tbe character and condition of all tidal observations obtained in the Survey to the close of 1884. In May he was assigned to duty on the New York Harbor resurvey. Reference was made in the report for 1883 to the detail of Subassistant E. D. Preston as a member of the Eclipse Expedition to Caroline Island, South Pacific Ocean, and to his return to San Francisco, and the comparative determinations of gravity made by him in July and August, 1883, at the station in that city established by Assistant Davidson. In the report for 1884 it should ha>e been stated that Mr. Preston, upon being ordered to the Atlantic coast, was employed on miscellaneous duty in the office of the Superintendent from Sep· tember 1, 1883, to January 15, 1884. During this time he investigated the relative accuracy of super110sition and contact in micrometric pointings; .determined the equatorial intervals of transit No. 5 for the use of the French Trani,iit of Venus Commission; reviewed the longitude work between Savannah, Ga., and Saint Augustine, Fla., and finished his computations for the report of Profcst-ior Holden on the Total Solar Eclipse of May 6, 1883. On January 15, 1884, Mr. Preston was granted six months furlough to proceed to Cordoba, Argentine Republic, South America, to aid Dr. Gould on bis work on the Southern Stars. In the office of Assistant in charge the clerical duties were very acceptably discharged by Dr. W. B. French, who had also the entire care of the office accounts, including the returns of money received for sales of charts. Mr. W. B. Chilton served as clerk and Mr. C. D. Gedney e.s stenographer in the office of the Superir>tendent. Mr. W. B. Morgan continued on duty as disbursing a.gent of the Survey, with Mr. .J. W. Pa.rsont1 as accountant and Mr. V . .J. Fa.gin as examiner.

CONCLUSION.

77

In the preparation of this report, and in the editing for publication of the last annual report and appendices thereto, Assistant Ed ward Goodfellow rendered service throughout the year. The report for the fiscal year ending with June, 1884, a ''olume of upwards of six hundred pages quarto, with twenty-five progress sket.ches and illustrations, ordered printed by Congress in Feb· ruary, 1885, was published in November, and is now ready for distribution. Extra copies of papers of special interest or practical value to surveyors, geodesists, and others, published as appendices to this report, had previously been supplied by the Public Printer. Events which led to my appointment as Superintendent in July last, and subsequently to the resignation by Mr. J.E. Hilgard of that position, have devolved upon me the duty of presenting this report to the Department. Respectfully submitted. F. M. THORN, Superintemlen.t. Hon. DA.NIEL MANNING, Secretary of the Treasury.

Co.AST .AND GEODETIC SrRVEY OFFICE,

Waskintrt.on, D. C., June 30, 1885.
Srn: I Lave tlie honor to submit herewith m.v annual report from the Ottice, with the usual annual reports from each Division. As in former years, tlie Computing Division, under the able management of Assistant C. A. Schott, lias fully maiutained its efficiency, all computations ha.>ing been kept up to date, aud a number of valuable reports submitted. All calls for information lrnve been promptly met, especially the unusually large number from the Office of the Geological Surwy, and this notwitl1standing the loss, by resiguation, of Dr. J. G. Porter, one of tl1e ablest computers, in September of last year, and the detachment of another computer for a considerable portion of the .rear. Mr. Schott has also found time to add still another mass of magnetic data to that already published, in the new tables of magnetic dips an cl intensities comprising some two thousand results, with a discussion of the secular ·ariation and geographical distribution of these elements in the United Stat{'s. It is creditahle to the growth and seieutific developIDl'Ut of the country that this class of infornrntion is more eagerly sought for than any other, despite its somewhat recomlite character. The J<;ngraving, Electrotypiug, and Priuting ])frisions have remained in charge of Assistant H. G. Ogden. The W0l'k of engraving new eharts has, as during last year, given wa_y to the more pressing uecessity of makiug corrections to eharts already publislied and largely used in naYigation, where resurveys have developed importaut changes. Four lrnndred and twenty-one plateR have been thus corrected . .Assistant Ogden urges au increase in the number of new charts to be printed and published by photolithogra]lhy, tiiat the results of our field stu,·eys may he more promptly made available for public use. You are aware that tilis method ha8 been pushed to the extreme limit possible with the present force in our Drawing Di"ision. The increase has been so rapi<l in excellence aiid in artistic merit in lllll!J·Printing by this method that I have heeu disposed to snbmit to you a plan for a small addition to our force of draug11tsmc11, with a corres1londing reduction elsewhere, in order to enable the Office to dispose more readily of the accumulating mass of data now ou hand and con tinnally coming in. A comparison of the newly published charts of New London Harbor and the 'l'hames Uiver, and also that of N cw· port, R. I., with other charts printed by photolitb.ograpl1y two years a,go will show the great change for the better to which I refer. The great diminutiou of cost is another reason for increasing this department of our work. Improvements have bet·n mude in the batteries used in electrotyping, and a greater amount . of work of a better character has been the result. These improvements have shown that it is not best to substitute a dynamo for tlie Smee and Walker batteries. A more uniform and regular deposit of copper has been obtained by the improved batteries upon the very large surfaces of our engraved plates than was hatl by the action of a dynamo. The Printing Office has been rebuilt according to the original design, giving the printers more

desirable quarters, with greater light and better air, while uew presses of better quality have also been added. Much difficulty has been experienced siuce January last in keeping· up our supply of paper of the prop~r quality aud size. This, joined to the delay occasioned by putting up the new building, bas rendered the whole number of charts printed during the year less thau in the pre· vious year. .Arrangements have been concluded by which it i-s probable that a larger number will be produced and disposed of in future. Mr. Ogden calls special attention ~o the able sen'ices of Mr. J. Il. Smoot, Clerk of the Engraving Division. The Tidal Di\-isiou has remained in charge of Mr.RS . .Avery. It is hoped that the work in this division will be largely increased in efficiency during the ensuing year. The Tide Tables for the Atlantic aml Pacific Coasts for 1886 are iu the bands of tlie printer. In their preparation the "Tide Predictor/ invented hy Professor ·Ferrel, has been largels used. An interesting iuci<leut of tbe year in this division has been the receipt from three widely separate1l tidal stations in tl1e I)acific Oceau of tlie automatic records of the perturbations o.ccasioned by the great .Krakatoa earthquake of August !W, to September 2, 1883. At the self registering ti<le-gauges near San Francisco, Kadiak in .Alaska, and Honolulu in the Sa11dwicli Islands, the earthquake wa-ves are l.lharply anu distinctly recorded. Tliis is especially the case at Honolulu. Photographic copies of the original records prepared in the Office have been forwarded to the Krakatoa Committee of the Royal Socif\ty at r,ondon by their request, and have also been priuted in "Sdmice" in this couutry. It is unfortunate that the self: registering tidegauge, formerlJ' maintai11P<l by the Coast and Geodetic Survey at .Mazatlan, had been destroyed in one of tbe frequent attempts at revolution in that region. A similar automatic record of that place would have been of the highest service in estimatiug the time and force of this great earthquake wave in its progress over a space equal to more than one-third of the distance around the earth. The Drawing Division has been actively employed dlll'ing the entire year. In addition to its regular work, as set forth by Mr. Eright, it ha>-1 furnished a large number of maps and tracings, specially called for by different branches of the Government aud by private parties. Many of these have been of an elaborate character, requiring much time in their preparation. In Appendix No. 3 is giveu a tabular statement of information·furuished from this and other divisions of the Office iu reply to oflicial and unofficial re11uests. A new feature introducedduringthe year has beeu the preparation of original topographic sheets tor pbotolithographic printing in fac-simile. This has been very successful, the reproduced sheets showiug great clearness in outline, with little or no· distortion in scale. .A combination of topographic and hydrograpbic original sheets upon a part of the Pacific Coast bas also been tried at the instance of Assistant Davidson, and bids fair to be successful. .A re-organization of this Division, with a small addition to its force, as before suggested, will add largely to its efficiency. Mr.1\1. W. Wines, General Office Assistant, has had charge oftbe Miscellaneous Division, and of all supplies to field parties of every kind of material needed hy them, except instruments, as also of the distribution and sale of the publications of the survey. By his methodical manner of con. ducting these duties every field party has been promptly oupplied, and much valuable time saved. His services to the Office in its relations with the Government Printing Office have contributed largely to the prompt publication of the Annual Heports. The Office buildings, the Carpenter Shop, and the Map-mounting and Chart roomsba-vealso been under his direction, as has been all communication with the Government Printing Office, and general supervision of all printing for the Coast and Geodetic Survey exoouted there. His duties have been laborious and responsible, and I owe hlm th.auks for the thoroughness with which they have been attended to. · In the Instrument Division, under charge of Mr. G. N. Saegmuller, Chief Mechanician, much work has been J.one in rflpairs and remodeling of mauy instruments. Many old instJ'uments have l>eeu regraduted and otherwise improved, and a large amount of miscellaneous work done. The alldition made to the printing office involved the removal of the small testing observatory west of it, and a. new and better one adjoining the Office of the Chlef Meoha.nicia.n has been erected in its pJaoo.

New instruments have been purchased as needed. .All the apparatus which could be spared from use, including representative instruments in every departmeut of our work, was put i.u thoronglJ order duriug October and NoYember, and sent to the New Orleans Expositiou, in charge of Ur.

In tht>se improvements I have had the skillful and ingenious assistance of l\1r. Saegmuller. A tabular statement will be found among the appendices to this report, gi,·iug i11 detail all in· formation as to the number aud classes of records added to the arclliveH tlm'irlg the past year. 'l'be whole number of new volumes of records of oli:mrvations, original a1Jd duplicate, is 1228. Up to Mareh 31st the arcbiw's were in charge of Mr. R. M. Harvey. At the close of tbe last fiscal year new projection tables, bm;ed upon the Olarlie spheroid, and extending from the Eqnator to tl1e Polt>, were in course of preparatiou lmtler m:'I- direction. These were cowpfoted and ha,·e now been printed, forming a hook of 18S quarto pages, and being the most t11orongh arnl complete compilation ever printed upon this subject. \Vllile uot free from error, it is hoped that these. tables will pron to be more free from tabular erro1·s tl1an others uefore publisl1ed. I am under obligations for faithful labor in this work to Sub-Assistant;; Baylor and McHrath, and to Mr. F. ritonse, aid, who made the compntatious, and to 31r. 2\IcGrat!J and 111iss S. 0. Asres, who prepared tlrn tables fOl' the printer, and read the proof. 111 thio; last mo;;t important matter I ba ve also to ackuowledg-e the great assistance rendered in the computing tlisi;;iou by Assistant Schott and Mr. Doolittle, which added largel;y to the accuracy of the completed work. 'l'he work of compilation of a map of the U11ited States has made 8low 1irogress during the past year for lack of competent persons to continue it who could be sp:u('d Jrmn 1111H'e pressing unties. But a large stock of material to be used in the work has been collected anll brought to the office, ready for use as soon as opportunity offers. At the comnrnucernent of the fiscal y;ar, a measurement of salt and fresh marsh laua. upon the Atlantic a11d Gulf Uoasts had been undertaken at the request of the Uornmissioner of Agriculture. This was completed by Mr. A. Lindenkobl and Mr. McGrath, and the resnlt8 communicated in tabular form. 'fheJ' have since heen printed. The work was elaborate and laborious, occupying about three month8. · After the middle of Augm;t, just as I hope.I, wit11 your permissiou to hiffe a mouth. of fieldwork, my principal Assistant, Mr. Bemy W. Blair, was seized with t_ypboicl fever and taken to· Providence Hospital. llis illuess was Yery severe and lusted nearly three months. ~When able to leave the Hospital be \rt·nt to his home in Lexin~ton, Va., to complete bis recovery, and there wrote a pamphlet giving a de8cription ot' tlte principal instruments coutained in the Uoast. and Geodetic Sur\·ey Exhibit at New Orleans, which was printetl and cinmlatecl tlJere. Having apparently recovered he started for New Orleans to take charge of the arrangement of the Exhibit and its displa~· in the Government Building. But his recovery was not real, and on bis way he was suddenly again prostrated, au<l died at Nashville of peritonitis on the 15th of DecC>mber.· Assistant Henry ·wayne Blair was appoi11ted u11on the Coast Survey at my im;tance, as au aid in January, 1871. He was a graduate of the Virginia Military Irrntitute, where his father, Col. William B. Blair, was a l'rufessor. He was the first J·oung gentleman from the South appointed upon the Survey after the war, ueiug strongly recommendtd by General :F. B. Smith, Superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute, and by General Beury C. \Vasne and General Joseph E. Johnston, of Georgia. He was attached to m.y party, tben in Georgia, and remained with me until 1877. Of all the young men whom it has been my good fortune to train to become useful aud effi· ci~nt officers upon our work, no oue has excelled him and but one has been his equal. rrompt, zealous, and untiring in field duty, he was equally useful in the Office, where his excellence as a clmie observer and mathematical reasoner procured him i·apid promotion. In 1875, at a competitive examination of twenty-three Aids, chosen from all the scientific institutions of the country, he came out at the head of the list. - - - - -------- "A tribute to the memory of Mr. Bla.ir a.ppea.rs in Appendix No. 18.

In all those traits of pernoual character which cause a man to he loYed, respected, ant! honored among bis comrades wlio best knew him, uo one held a big·Lcr pm;itiou, and 110 oue is to.clay more lamented. To me, hotl1 perso11ally aud ofiicially, his loss is irre:µarable. I Joyed him as a sou, and leaued npon him as my Chief Assistant iu the Office, to an exteut i did U(>t realize uutil bis untimely death. Assistant C. ll.

Duriug the year a larger 11umber of plates tbau usnal h:H"e bePu electrot~·11ed for the Engineer Office of tl1e Army aud tbe H~«1rograpbic Office of the Navy. U ll<ler au arrirngerneut with these Offices, made hy my predecessor, this work has been paid for at a fixed rnte, and the Office has receiYed from this source the sum of $1,!JHl.42, wl1icll lias been turned onr by nw to the Di>·lmrRing Office, ancl placed to the crl:'dit of our appropriatiou for electrotypiug, &c. (See Sundry civil bill, 1884-'.S5; appropriation for <Joast and Geodetic Sunt,y Ollie!:' expem;es, paragrapL 2.) On the 2d of this rnontll, I receind the usual monthly statement of t~xpemlitures arnl available lmlanccs, and found that after allowing for all probable expi>111litme under this item, for the remainder of tbe year, then· would still remain an aniilahle bahrnce of nearly $3,000, enough to euahle me to carr_y out certain nruch-needed improvements, which I 11atl loug coutcmplated, but had not meam; to m1der1 ake, These were (1) au eleYator to enable the bearers of our l1eavy copper plates to transpol't them readily between the 1iri11tiug oflice, uear the basemeut of the buildiHg, and the engraviug room in the upper stor,y, and (2) a gas-engine of sufticieut power to nrn the elerntor, and al:;o to supply power to the difforent work-shops-enabling more ·work to be do11e iu all of tl1ew with less lalJor. HaYing ascertaine<l from the First Uomptro1ler tliat the propm;ed flxpeuditure was lawful, I proceeded, with ;vonr permission, to make the necessary contracts, and tl1e work upon all of them is well in hand. 'Vhe11 completed J.foel sure that they will effect a great gain in both efficiency and comfort. I have also fitted up a large room UJ)On the lower floor of the !<'ire-proof building for a Libmry, whicl1 is uow in a suitable place witl1 plenty of ligl1t, aud so near to the Archives that the keeper of the Arcl1ives can also act as J,ibmrian. Tbe large space betwee11 tl1e new Library and tl1e ArchiYes is to be fitted up with shelYes for Jwldiug copper-plates. The rooms occupie<l by the old librar;y are occupied for instrtuneuts, which are 11ow near the instrument work-rooms, and easily accessihle therefrom, while the room opposite, 110w filled with copper-plntes, will he tume<l over to tbe l\1iscellaneom; Di\'isiou, which is in great need of more room for storage of heav,y hooks that now overload the attic of the main building. Duriug the uext six months I hope also to reorgauize the Archives, and render the large aud valuable mass of data collected there more accesisible to all who liave to consult our records. 'fbe experience acf]ltired in 1884 has enabled me to see opportunities for some retrenclnneut iu the expenditures of the office, and last winter, with :your consent, 1 reduced the estimates accordiugl~·. The amount appropriated for otlice expenses during tbe fiscal year 110w beginuing is $40,800, while for the ;year endiug to-day it l1as been $44,HOO, thus effecting a saving of $3,800. If other changes can he effected this sum may be still f:uther reduced in the JJext year. The clerical duties of the office have beeu ably discharge<l by Dr. \V. B.

'l'he computing force snstai1wd a l'lerious loHs b,r the resignation of Dr. ,J. G. Porter (now Director of the Ci11cin1rnti Obser\·atory) soon after the beginning of the fiscal year. The place of this expert computer has not been filled. 'l'he DiYision was also deprh·ed for nine months of the sen·ices of ;\fr. H. Farqnhar, who was assigned to the party of As8istant C. S. Peirce. This place was also left. meant during that time. Thccompnting force being thus curtailed and having assigned to it the recomputation and adjnstment to the Coa:;;t. and Geoiletic Snn·ey triangulation of the Borden snr\'ey of J\fasxachnsetts, executed from 1s:;2 to 1838, it became absolutely necessary to prm·ide for some temporary assistance in order that the current work might be properly sustained. In conseqtH'n<~e l\Ir. J. N elsou wa8 assigned to the Computing l>iYision from August 1, 1884, to September :!O, 1884; Assistant 0. H.

Automatic tide-gauges, from wl1ich observations have bt'en reeei \"e<l or expected, haxe been used at the following stations: Pulpit Harbor, North Haven, Me.; Providence, R. I.; New Haven Breakwater, Conn.; Governor's Island, N. Y.; Sandy Book, N. J.; Fort Mifflin, near Philadelphia, Pa.; Charleston, S. 0. ;

Saucelito, Cal.; Sai11t Paul, Kadiak Island, Alaska; Fort Simpson, British Columbia; Honolulu, Sandwich Islands. The gauges at Pulpit Harbor, Saucclito, aml Saint Paul are kept rul!uing continually to obtain long uuuroken series. The gauges near New Haven and at Governor's Island arc run uy hydrographic parties, and will be stopped during winter. The gauge at Sanely Hook does not work well in winter. It hall not hcen doing good work for some months, and a better place should be found for it, where it can he run tbrou1?:hout the year. Only a fmT observatious have been received from Fort Mifflin, and those were not very good. A g11uge should be used at Philadelphia by an experienced observer for at least a year, a good series there being much needed as a ba8is for predictions. Another automatic gauge will prouahly be cstabfo;hed snon on the coast _of Maine, in connection with the hydrographic wnrk, the arrangemeuts for which base been 111rrtly made. It bas beeu found to add greatly to the value of h,ydro· gmphicwork to Inn-e it rcd11ce{l by the aid of a good series of observations made with ~in automatic tide gauge, and where extensirn surveys are in progress there should he at least one such gauge to sen·e as a basis for comparison with others. The plan for obtaining a long series at Fernandina, or some place north of it on the Southern Coast, should be carriPtl out, and the observations on the coasts of Louisiana aud Texas, required for completing the tidal surn\Y of the Hulf of :Mexico, should be resumed and extended to a year at each place occupied, The range of the tides on these coasts is small, but their peculiar character gives them importance, as it iH necessary to continue the observations day and night in order to get trustworthy <lata for redneiug soundings, and tliis has not always ueen done. In the following table I gfre a list of the stations at which automatic tide-gauges were in operation during the fi;;cal year. with names of olJservers and times of occupation of stations.

There are two B-ri1llcr gaugei,; and oue 2-roller gauge in tl1e Office, all ready for use. The records recPived from the automatic gauges, aml also those sent to the Office b.r the hydrographic parties, are inspected as soon as received; and reduced by t.he Tidal Division. Notices of them may be found in the accounts of work done in the different sections. The observations of the hydrograpl1ic parties are mostly made with st:iff or box gauges, and many of them only during daylight. This mode give8 results of a fairly approximate nature for tidal phenomena on the Atlantic Coa8t, hut, on the coasts of tl1e Pacific and Gulf of Mexico ohscn·ations shoul<l be kept up both da.Y and 11ight, to outaiu an accurate reduction for the soundings. ·
OFFICE-WORK.

The obsen·crs at the permanent 8tations where automatic gauges are usetl have hmm taught to tabulate the high awl low water8 and hourly ordinates from the cun·es, before sending these to the Otlice, and to se111l first tht.1 tabulations, and afterward the curves. The loss by mails is thus made less serious, and the obsef\·ers become more skillful and careful, while the amount of Office work is considerably reduced. The obserrntions obtained by the automatic gauges and by the bydrographic parties a.re reduced and discussed according to tl1e most approved methods in the Tidal Division, and the

results are used in the Chart tables, in the predictions, aud for other purposes, and enable the Division to furuisll a large amount of information about tides to Offkers of the Sun-ey, Civil and United States Eugineers, and others, the demand for which is rapidly increasiug. "Tide Tables," containing tile predictions for the Atlantic mal Pacific Coa:-;ts of tlw l'11ite<l States for the year 1886, ha\'e been computed hy the 'ricl~tl DiYisiou, and are Leing published, making the twentieth year of the series. The predicting-machine inYented by Professor :Ferrel was more exte11shel:v usetl in this work than in predicting for 1885, and for some of the places improYe<l con:<tauts were t>mployed. Considerable labor was required in computing the8e constant8, Yerif,ving them liy trial~. alltl i11 adapting these taules to the uew mode of reckoning time. 'l'he following computers have been employed in tllis I>ivision in the cour~e of the year: RS. Avery, L. P. Shid;y, .M. Thomas, and C . .B. 'l'urnbull, in the Oftic('; and .1. G. Spaul11i11g and L. ,J. Ferrel out of it. Mr. Avery was in charge of the Division, and inspected all the tidal oh;;ernitious recei\·ed, attended to the correspondence with observers and otherl:! relating- to tides, plauuetl aud supervised the work on tides and tide-gauges, prepared the predictions for printiug aud read the proofs, and computed when not otherwise engaged. Mr. Shid.v tabulated and reduced many obRerYations receiYed fro111 the an 1omatic gauges arnl hydrographic parties, predicted for Rome plaees where the ol<l 1m·thocl,.; had to hC' n~ed, and with the predicting-machine for others; impro\·ed the tables for calculating comp011e11h; for the machine, computed and tested various components, and aided efficielltly in 11111d1 miscell:wPous work. Miss Thomas worked on the simplest reductions and 011 tlie bonrl;\· ordinates fo1· permanent statiorn;, aiding sometimes on miscellaneous work and copying. MiHs Tnruhnll has lwen emplo.1 ed in cop,viug, tracing, and tabulating tides, aud sometimes in aiding i11 t~asJ- retl11crio11s anti miscella11eous work. Mr. Spaulding aided in 1.:omputing components for use in making the predictions, in addition to his services as Tidal Observer at Pulpit Harbor. Miss Ferrel worked on the discussion of observations hy tl1e Hm·111m1ic A ualysis to 0 n111l components to use iu the predicting-machine, and for other purpose8. Respectfully submitted. RS.

li'ashington, Juf.y 1, ]88;). SIR: I respectfully submit the following report of work executed in the Engra' ing Divi;;iou during the year ending· June 30, 1885. The correction;; to the plates, required before printing for isi,m<', ha'\'e continued to iiicreaRe in Imm ber and from the numerous additions from resurve~·s have required more labor th au in former years. Four hundred and tweuty-oue chart plates aud fourteen sketches were corrected, in adtlition to extensive alterations in new printing plates electrotyped from the standard altos. vre lun·p also had the usual amount of cleaning electrotnies, erasures from altos, arranging and drawing titles, general lettering and notes, marking instruments, &c. Several important charts have been well advanced in addition to those completed, but the time required in correcting the printing plates and bringing up new electrotype copies, seriously interferes with the production of new charts. This work is necessarily of tl1e first importance, as the published charts mrnst be kept up to date HO far as as information received will permit; the time required for it h; on the increase, and l cannot urge upon you too strougly the consideration of suitable methods to bring the surve~·s be· fore the public in preliminary form, and thus give more time for the completion of the fiuished charts without delaying the publication of important new sm·\·eys. The engravers have been employed as follows: Me;:srs. Joseph Enthoffer, ~W. A. Tbompsou, H. C. Evans, H. }'.Bartle, and E. J. Enthofier, 011 Topography aud Sand. Mes8rs. E. A. Maedel, A. Petersen, J. G. Thompson, a11d F. Courteuay, 011 Lettering. .Messrs. E. H. Sipe, W. H. Da\·is, and A. C. Ruebsam, on Lettering and Miscellaneous Corrections; and Messrs. II. M. Knight and T. Wasserbach, on Lettering, Sand, and Miscellaneous Corrections. The electrotyping of the copper plates has coutinued under my direotion with the immediat.i supervision of Dr. A. Zumbrock, assisted by :Frank Over. The improvements made in the batteries haYe resulted in more regular work. The batteries do not break down and are more readily cared for, requiring much less labor. Observations are now being made to determiue the relative values of the carbon and our old silver plates. The printing for the chart room during the year has fallen off about 14 per ceut. of the 11re· ceding year's work, or over 4,500 impressions. This is largely due to the interruption caused by bnilding the additio11 to the printing room, and the failure of the contractors to keep up the supply of chart paper. For about two months it was impossible to fill the requisitions from the chart room with the usual promptness, which has douhtless resulted in a diminislied issue to the sale agenhi. The new press room affords much better light and facilities for work, aud being on a level with tlrn street, instead of below it, will doubtless proYe more healthful to the workmen. It is sufficieutly large to accommodate the new 38·inch copper.plate press, in addition to the two old JJresses, aud will permit the requisite increase of force when the demand for charts shall make an increase necessary. The force of printers bas remained the same; the presses have been in charge of Mr. F. Moore, foreman, and Messrs. D. N. Hoo·rnr and James L. Smith. Mr. John H. Smoot bas continued as clerk to the division, and I take pleasure in commending his strict attention to his duties, and the very satisfactory chart proof.reading he now furnishes .

Brown was employed as night fireman from November 26, 1884, to May 31, 1885. With these two exceptions, there have been uo changes in the force of watchmen, messengers, and laborers.

The foregoing exhibit shows that there were registered in the archives during the past fiscal 57:2 \'olumes of geodetic observations and computations; 80 \'Olnmes astronomical obsen-ations a11d computations; 139 volumes magnetic observations aud computations; 751 volumes h,ydrogiapliie obsen-ations and specimens of sea-bottom; 10 original topographic sheets, aml <H original hydrographic sheets-making a total in volumes, specimens, and sheets com binecl of J ,GI3. On account of the absence of the regularly appointed Librarian by reason of seYcre illness, no full 1w:onl was kept of the number of volumes received in the I"ibrary previous to December 19. Since that date, howe\'er, au accurate registry has heen made of all publications received, and the~· haxe been classified and arranged in their res pee ti ,.e places. In all, including unbound and bmrnd works, ±77 volumes have been entered on the register. There were prepared and sent out for binding 139 volumes, all of which were returned neat!~· a!l(l dumbly bound. During tile year many strayed books were reeovern1l and returned. Tb.e entire library was rearranged, an1l a catalogue made, copies of which were furnished the Superintendent awl Ai:;sistauL in charg-e of Office. The present. condition of the Lihrary, though susceptible of further improvement, is generall~ consiclered as being somewhat better than in years past. The number of volumes taken out since December 10th is eight hundred and twei1t,y-seve11. A careful record has been kept of all such books, and their present whereabouts is accurately known.

As hnetofore the work of the Divisiou has consisted mainl~· of repairs and readjtrntm(·.11t of instruments turned in by the \Hrious ilelll parties. Numerous C1ld instruments have he,,u imprC1,·ed. remodeled, and in some ciises entirely reconstructed, and 80me new instruments, maiuly minor one;;, have been manufactured. The hulk of the uew instruments required to meet the de111a11d of tile Survey have been purchased, as the manufacturing facilities of the office are limited and the force emploJed small. All i1Jstrumeuts returned from the field lmve been carefully examined aud such re1,airs as WPre evidently needed aml such improYernents and alterations as were recommeuued by the field assistants have been made. Such parts as had become worn or broken were replaced aud tltt' im·tl'llments pn tin thorough order for future use.

REPORT OF THE HYDROORA PJ{JC INS/' ECTOR FOR THE rEAI! ENDING .TU.YF

U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC

Washington, Jnly 15, 1885. DEAR SIR: I have the houor to make the following statement iu relation Co the branc11 of the Survey with which I han~ hePn connectRd for the past eight years, mH1 of which I haw; hail charge for 1iearly fiye yea.rs. This will constitute the amrnal report for tbe fiscal ~-ear rndi11g J unP :w, 1885, and beiug my 1~1st I may be pardoned for touching 011 some topics which may >wem foreign to the subject-matter. The beginning of the fiscal year fouml most of the h,rdrographic parties preparing for work, which could not commence until after Jnl.Y 1, as has been mmally the caRe during the past sen·n years with the limited appropriations made b.r Congre.<;s. As I have mentioned in preYious reporti,;, to get the most economical results, hydrographic work should begin on the Northern Coast as early as May 1, and can continue, as a rule, until the middle of October or fat of November. Tlw expenses of refitting the Yessels and the priucipal items for keepiug the partiPs at work are about the same for a long as a·sbort season. It is, therefore, e\ident that with fowls :ffailable for the months of July, August, and September only, the season is shortened abont 50 per cc11t., :ind as the weather during September is generally unset.tied, and a l·Ortion of July 1uust be commnwd in getting the Yessels to their stations, the best portion of the season is lost by the dt>lay. In Yiew of tbe apparent strong disinclination of Congress to increast' the appropriations for party expenses, I would urge that a sufficient llmount be retained out of tbe allotments for i,;u n·eys on the Northern Coast for work during the laist two months of each fiscal year so tllat it may hf' made continuous during the summer. I think this polic,v is particularly applicable to the resurvey of I.ong Island Smmd, and it was with this object in view that I recommended the i,;ehern<' approved by you for the pre.sent season. With only one schooner part~· (Lieut. S. C. Paine'"· on the schooner Ueady) 011 that work, but a small portion of the appropriation will be required this summer, and if sufficient is available next spring to put two schooners and one steamer on tlw surrny, and for them to ).>e allowed to continue nuder the appropriation for the fiscal yPar 1887, I anticipate the completion of the resun·ey of Long Island Sound during the next. fiscal year. During the summer of 1884 there was engaged 011 the hydrography of the coast of Mai11P the schooner Eagre, with a party under charge of Lieut. E. n. F. Heald, U.S. N., Assistant. Umtst a1ul Geodetic Survey. A scheme which included some special examinations on tl1is coast was prepared for tlw h,nlrographic party on board the steamer Blake, under charge of Lieut. Commaudcr \V. IL Browm;ou, U. S. N., Assistant Ooast and Geodetic Survey. Owing, however, to a delay iu the coustructiou of two new boilers for this vessel at. Baltimore, the party did not get to work in time to take it up. Lieutenant-Commander Brownson was enabled, however, to make some important examinations in Vineyard Sound; Narragansett Bay, and Long Islaud Souml, which are specially mt>ll· tioned in bis report to you. During the same period the schooner Palinurus, with a hydrograpllic pa1;ty under charge of

UNITED STATES UOAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Lieut. \'\7. G. Cutler, U. S. N., A8sistant Coast arnl Geode.tic Survey, was engaged upon the resurn'yof Long Island Sotmd. A larger hytlroµ;raphie force than this was not ner·essarr, as the hydrographic snrn~.rs were, at that time, well in mivance of the topography, and coul<l be prosecuted to better adnrntage after the points on wl1ich to base the work bad beeu furnished by the cidl assistants. A surnll party on board the scboouer H<>ady was sent into Long Island Sound under charge of Ensign A. F. Fechtekr, U.S. N., Assistant Coast am! BeoclPtic Stuvey, and made some special examinations, the small expense of the party being not mnch more to the 811rV1\V than if the vessel bad been laid up with Iler crew on broad. Later this parry located a rock in Narragansett Ba.v, and still later made a snrn'y of the shoals extencling off Cape Henry, Va., upon which thee. S. S. Ossipee had strnck, and wluch bad been reported as of greater area than the published charts gave. 'l'lte gew ral contours were, found to be about thP same as given from the survey of1855, and it ap· pean~d that thP vessel when aground was on a shoal distinctly marked on the cllarts with 12 feet of water npon it. Tbe rpsult of the season's work is detailed in the report rnalle to you by the chief of party. Xew York Harbor being a place of so mucll importanct', a1Hl tlie changes ou it8 bar, though slight, l"f'(jlliri11g frequent examinatious to keep tl1t· mariner ::;uppliecl witb the latest information, it has het·11 my endeavor to give some atte11tion to it each ~·ear. Since the complete resurvey of the bar made hy Lieut. Commander E. B. Thomas, U. S. N., Assistant Coast am! Geo1letic Sur,·ey, in 1882, Co11grps,; has mach· no allowance nntil the present year for l'!uch work. Iu the summer of 1883, the schouller Drift having returned from work ou tl1e Sonthem Coa>:<t late in the season, and it being ver~~ desirable to keep tbis party intact for the winter's work, I"ieut. ,J.C. Premont, O. S. :X., As:-;ist<rnt Coa;;t awl Geodetic Survey, the chief of party, w;ts assigned to this field aml obtaint>d data for correcting the charts. Likewise, in 1884, coasidt>rnble data were obtained for this pnrpoi'e. Tlw steanwr Bache, by reason of rPqniriug- new boilers, was left out of the general scheme for work during tlw snmmer seasou of 1884, bnt the perfectly organized parts on board that vessel, as a mattPr of good public policy retained in the Sur\'ey 011 their naval pay, was used for this piupose. 'l'he chief of party, Lieut. H. H. :'lfanstield, C. S. X., .L\..ssistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, in anticipation of an assignment to a reg-nlar wn-al cruiser, wa;; allowed leave, and I assume1l the g-e1wral charge of au examination of t.!1e 1mti11 Ship alltl Swa;;h Clm111Jels, which was well 1ione lJy tlw party, uwler the irnme1liate direction of Eusig-11 .J. :\I.

I would state here that the Survey, in losing the 8erviecs of Lieutenant Mansfield, by rea,sou of his detachment after a four years' tour of duty, lost one of the most valuable hydrographers with whom it has been my good fortune to be as:soeiate<l. l 1'ertile in resources, thorough iu his conception of the work, unassuming aml pleasant to his suuordiuates, his party was always ready for liis quietly-gi\·en instructions, and his abilities were fully equal to the exeeution of any work intrusted to him. It was only necessary to furnish him wit.11 projections and point out the field to he !lure of good results. The Survey eannot too soon recall him to its work when his services shall become available.

No assignment to tlie command of t11e steamer Blake could, in my opiniou, promii;e such g·ood results as that of Lieut. J. E.

'l'his officer's long experience as the Execntin· omcer of tliis same Yessel during '1'llic!J he frequently was called upon to take tiie chief conrunrnd, Iris Jong familiarity with charts, hii:; mechauical ingenuity, and his indornitahlP \\ill cauH· me to fet>I the greatest co11fidt>11ce i11 thP fntu!'e of this scarcely devclo1Jed but important lnauch of tlm Sm ve~·, Yiz, det'p-sea curreut;;.

Overcorniug difficulties that aU11ost mJJ- one else would lta,·e regarded insurmountablf, lie ha~ anchored the steamer Blake in the Gnlf Stream in fonr or five hu11dred fathoms of water, remaining at anchor almost continuously for a complete lmrnr 111ontl1, and while his records are not yet co111pleted, the chief of the hydrological hrauch of t11e Survey, Prof: H. Mitchell, is enthusiastic iu his commendations of the achievements of this party, an<l being so thoroughly interested i11 this part of the work, I myself feel that I cannot clo;;e this, my last n·port, without placing on record m~ strnng admiration for the ability of J,ieutenant Pillsbury. Congress having in February passed 1.be appropriatio11 bill contaiuing an item for the resm· vey of New York Harbor, whicl1 .ibonld hecome immediately aniilable, the office lurn been taxed to its utmost to obtain the number of proper officers to organize tbe four parties uecessaQ· for the work.

The :-;d1eme prqiared by m~·self <lllU apprO\"ed hy ~·on, made the followiug dispositiou of the parties: Lieutenant Hanus with the steamer Endeavor, one steam lauuch, and when neces>mry the ;;teamer Daisy to SlllTP.V the Entrance and 1mtin channels. Lil'utmianr Hawley" ith hiH party on boar<l the schooner Eagre, to which is attac!Jed one steam launch, to surn·y tlw East Hin·1· from O:on»rnor's Island to the eastward. Lieuteuant Unth~r with bis party a!lll a steam launch attached to the :,mllooner Palinurns, was to tmrve~· in tlw North Rin~r, heg-inuiug at Governor's faland. Lient<:uant Cart,,r on board the schoo1wr Drift with a steam launch was to be associated with a }'arty on hoard the sdrno11er Scoresh~·, urnler .Assistant H. L . .\lariudiu, wlto was also Rupplie<l with a steam launch, 011 special current observations at first. Later it is proposed that the Drift's party slioulil make current obsernitious outside the entrance of New York Bay. Thtese partiel'<, with tlw exception of the Drift, were in the field about the first. of .May, but were >:onrnwhat delayed on account of want of topographical data which could not then be furnished; still a very creditable commencement was made up to .June 30. Of course this cannot he fully reported befom its compll'tion, and uaturally comes in the next annual report of the Hytlrographic Inspector. Of the other Yessels of the Surn>..Y uot mentioned before in this report, I bave to statP that thii ;;tl'alller Hitchcock was used by the topographical party under Assistant F. W. Perkius, ou t11e coast of Louisiaua. The barµ:e Beaut,\' was usml by th('. topogmphieal part.v under A.ssistm1t 0 . .\1.

The schooner Quick was also in smTice in charge of A,;sistaut ,Joseph llergesheimer off the West coast of Florida. 'l'he schooner Drift, ou which was the h;plrographic party under Eusigu A. F. l''echteler, U. S. N., was taken to the eastern end of Long Island an<! used by the topographical party mHler charge of Assistant Oharles Hosmer. Of the remaining ves:;;elR, the Rteamer Barataria, schoouers G. l\1. Bache, Sillinu1n, and Researnll wen· laid u11 during- the entire year. All of these vessels have about arrived at a point beyond which repairs become unprofitable, and as the Bache and Silliman could be used in an emerge11cy, it might be well to retam them on the list, but I would recommend that the Iiesearch be sold :is uttPrl.r lll'<eless. Through the reeonm1ewlation of Ueneral Samuel .B. Holabird, Quartermaster-General U. 8. A., a \'\·ry valuable addition ha.s been ma.Ile to the tleet of vessels by the transfer of the schoon..,r l\latcbh·ss from the \Var Dep~ntment to the Coast and Geodetic Survey. \\~hile the trausfer fr i11 the 11ature of a loau, it is probable that the Snrve;v may be i-lossessed for a 1mmber of yt>ars to come of aver;\' good·~chooner. Ou recommendation of the Light· house Board, a very useful little nissel has been obtained by tlu· trausfer of the steamer Daisy. The Yessel, though quite old, is, it, is thought, good for several years' sen·iee iu inside waters. Wllat has preceded refers to parties and vessels employed on the Atlantic Coast.
I'A.CIFIC COA.ST.

On tbe Pacific Coast much difficulty is experienced in executing hydrographic work, for uot

is the coast a ver,y <litlicult one to work upon, but the 8mall appropriations permit only a small portion each ye<w to be l'lpent in actual field-work. Tl.Je repair and outfit of the >et1.sels are a.t a cost. almost double what it woul<l be 011 this coast, while the wa.ges of men are also much higher, as, for instance, a seaman in the Merchant service gets from $!0 to $70 per mouth, in other brauches of the Go\·ernment service be receives about $40, while seamen on board Uoilst anll Geodetic Survey vessels who are shipped on Naval Rolls receive only $2-t. This is made up to about $30 un<ler the allowance for subsistence, but as the appropriations will permit it for only four or lh'e montus out of the year it can readily be seen that good

OFFICI<~-WORK.

The general office-work has progressed, as mmal, to my entire satisfaction, the results being presented in the talmlated records appended to this report, of work done by Messrs. Eugt>ne Willenbiicher, "''· U. \Yille11biicher, and F. C. Dorm. I may be permitted here, as I am about to sever my connection with the SurvPy, to submit some remarks in relation to the office of the Hydrographic Inspector, as the matter a11Pcts others, and, I heli1we, the ser\'ice in general, whose iuterest alone I have attempted to st11d.v during the past eight years of m~· life. As I understand, tlrn duties of the Hydrographic Inspector, and wliich, from my numerous interviews with ~'OU, I am led to beliPve :rncord with your Yiews, are as follow::;: He rs ill charge of tbe detail::; of all hytlrogrnpliic work, acting as th·' chief a<h·iser and e:xecuti,·e officer of the Super· intendeut in hydrography; lwiug rei'p011Rible to him for tlw proper execution of all hi::; instructions in relation to h~·drographic matters, ill the :same mamwr as the Asiodstaut in charge of Office and Topography is responsible to him in mattnl'i pertaini11g to the office and to110,graphy. As the Inspector of H_ydrography aml as iu clrnrge of the repairs and maintenance of the Vl'ssels of the Survey, his duties are in the field as well as in tlrn offir~e, and among the \'essels, with a view to harmrmizing all the work of the Yarions hyclrographil- parties, and to obtain the best results in the repairing of vessels that hi8 t>xperience. and the Snperintendent's allotmenti; may 1mggest. He is at the same time in charge of tbe HydrogTaphic offiet>, which embraces the Hydrograpbic Dh·ision and the Coast Pilot Dfrision. l have endeavored to carry out this, my interpretation of the Superintendent's varions discussions, and I belieYe that in most cases some benefit l1as accrued to the harmony of the various braucbe8 of the work. I have been extremely fortunate in having associated with me in the office the best men that ba"'e ,graduated from the Survey under previous assignments. The Coast Pilot work met with a loss when, in December last, Lieut. J.E. Pillshmy was assigned to the commaud of the steamer Blake, but in tl1e end, the service will gain by bis transfer to that command. Partly from sickness during the past year, more on accom1t of necessal'y absence from the office on duty, but principall;y from my sense of what was due the ability of that officer, I ban>: gradually turned all tbt· details of the HJ drograpliic Division over to Lieut. Jeff. F. Moser, U. S. N., Assi;;taut Coast and Geodetic Survey, iu whose hands the ver:v bt·st re;;ults possible will be obtained. The Sun·ey will never suffer for want of a strong man (with the most liberal construction that can be placed on the word) for auy 11ositiou in the service as long as be is available tor its work. Mr. Edward H. W;yvill bas. as mmal, gfreu valuable assistauee as my clerk. I cannot close this, my last report, without expressing my warmest personal obligations for the ma11J· acts of courtesy l have receiw<l from nearlJ· eyer;}' member of the Survey, from the Superinteudent down, aud my interest will t·vn center i11 work wliieh to me bas so mauy pleasant. associations.

THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION AND SECULAR VARIATION OF THE MAGNETIC DIP AND INTE"'SITY IN 'l'HE UNITED STATES.
By CHARLES A. SCHOTT, As.-.istant.

COMPUTING DIVISION, 00AS'l' AND GEODETIC 8URVEY.

October 21, 1885. DEAR SIR: Accompanying this I submit a paper entitled ":\fagnetic dip and intensity, with their secular variation aml gt:ographical distributio11 in tlte United State:;," with three maps and · three plates, intended to form Appmidix ~o. 6, report for fii,ma.J year 1884-'85. This paper const.itutes tlle con duding part of the magnetic researches latel.v undertakf'n by the Survey, those relating to the declination b:n·ing been published in A.ppemlices 1~ and 13, report for 1882; the epoch of reduction being tlie same, viz, Ja.nuar;y, 1885. Upon first. taking up the su4ject, o\·er thirty years ago, it became apparent that the time hud not arrived for a profitable discus;;iou of the \·er.r meager material theu on hand. I haYe, therefore, confined my labors in the interval to the collcctiou of obser,·atious, <leforriug discussion to a later time. In the general table of magnetic dips aud iutem;ities now presented, there are, systematically arranged, 2000 dip observations and more than 1500 horizontal inteu,;ity observations. The order is by States and Territories, and for each division b;y latitude of station, and for ea.cl1 place the observations are given in chronological sncces:o;ion. This table, eoutainiug a general collectiou of all obserYed ,-aJues (known to me) from the earliest times, will, it is supposed, be of more permammt value than the additional information it coutaius relating to tlte epoch 1885. The discussion of the secular variutiou of the dip resulted iu a more or less complete knowledge of the law of change during the hu;t sixt.v St'ar::1, anu enabled me to recognize and delineate a belt of present "no chauge" wit.h increasinl{ dip on one side and decreasing dip on tbe other. A similar foature was recognized iu the discussion of tlie secular Yftriation of the horizoutal intensit,y, the absoluw measures of which hardly exteml back half a centnrr. The above results are laid. down 011 three <liagrams, and the details of the preseut geogra11hical distribution over the area of the Uuited States are presented on three maps, on a scale :-i<lapted to the density of distribution of the obsernttions autl the intricacies of the isomagnetic curvm;.

INTRODUCTION.

In the aunual reports of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year 1880-'81 and the fil;cal _year 1881-'82 the subject of terrestrial magnetism, aud in particular that part of it relating to the declination, has been brought to tlie latest practieable state of forwardness, as far as it relates to tlie operations of the Survey, and seems nearly ex!JaustiYe of the material so far accumulat.,d by observers. It appeared, tuerefore, timely to <lireet a.tteution to the state of our knowledge of the magnl:'tic dip and intensity. Indeed, for .ren rs past it has seemed to urn desirable to resume their discussio11, which was abandoned uearly thirty years ago. During this time the demand for practical information about the magnetic dip and intensity has increased, mainly in consequenee of the necessity of giving closer atteution to the deviation and adjustment of the compass in iron and steel ships, though in this connection no high degree of accuracy of numerical values was required. The ohservationR accunmlated since 1855 gave a better prospect of obtaining clearer and more precise information reRpecting the law of the secular change of the dip and of the intl'nsit:r, and, as will be seen i11 tlie sequel, this brief period em braced the (unsuspected) occurrence of a seeoudar.r max.imum in tile Yariation of the dip, as well as of a minimum in· the variation of the horizontal component of the intensity. But the principal object in view in making the present investigation was to advance our knowledge iu thil' department of terreHtrial pliysics hy completing the work already undertaken by the Survey aml liringing the results up to date. It was, therefore, indispensable first to prepare as complf'.te a collection of data as could be brought togetiler, to scrutinize a.nd arrange them, and finall.r to discuss and present the results. PAR'l' I. In the general collection of rlata, a11 far as they were known or accessible to me, there are brought together iu systematic form all obserrnd dip:s and inteosit,ies within our IJounlla.ries from the earliest to the present time. The olisen·ations for dip a.ml for horizontal and total intensitie.s are arranged alphabt>tieally, according to tbe present political divisions h.r States aud Territories, an<l within each of these snbdh·isio11s the Hrrangement is h,Y latitude, and for each station the several rmmlts, if an,r, are pl:wed in strietly chrouologieal order. To cover such adjacent regions outsidl:l of our houndaries as seemed desirable for the purpose of eonstructing isomagnetic charts, several geographical didisions are added to the collection. This arraugemm1t then dilfors but in one particular from that adopted iu 1882 in the c1,se of tlw declinations, viz, it uuites in one table all results, whereaR the drcliuations, ou account of their greater number, were more conveniently presented in tu:o table11, the last containing the chronological arrangement for each place in conuection with toe discm1sio11 of the 8Ccular changP. Nu ob.st·1Tations made at sea were admitted in the c-0llection, these being in general less accurate, for waut of co111plete Bliminatiou of the efteet of loeal attraction on board ship. There a.re, however, a ft·w results included obtained on the frozen oct>an off the coast of Alaska, and it is only in this Territors that the question of the a1h·isability of t,1king iu ob.,.ern1tions made at sea could arise. Many sueh additional obserrntious, if neC'ded, might he taken from the Philosophical Transactions of tlw Ho,yal Society for 1872, Ooutributions to Terrestrial Magnl:'tism, No. XIII, by General Sir Edward Sabine. The table proYides for d1p1:1 (fl), horizontal iuteusities ( H), arnl total intensities (F), but not for vertical iutensities ( V), ais the latter are not suh.ieet to direct iustrumeutal measure, whereas H, as well as F, ma.r barn been instrumeutally determined, tlwugb where the resulta are given in absolute measure, H alone could have been directly so measured. In consequence of the mutual relations

of 8, H, V, F, when any two of these quantities are given by observation the other two may be found. 'l'he a.nalytical dependence between the tahnlar values H, H, F may not. always appear numerically strictly satisfied, for the reason tl1at each of the threP quantities re;nlts directly from independent observations, an<l thus uecessarily is I'll bjeet to error; hence the rf'lation H = F cos fl would be but partly satisfied, but w ht'll stri<:tl;y satit;fied by the tabular values it iudicates that two only of the three values entering were d<:'rived from <lirect ohi;;erYa tiou. F ulPss access cau be bad to the original records or discussion, it is uot always possible to kuow which of these quantities were the original ones, though in refined work and in lower maguetic latitu1l1~s gcul:'ra!ly H awl H, and in the higher mag11etic latitn 1les fl and F, will lw found i11 the majoriry of cases to ban' been the fundamental,ancl F and H, respectiHly, tLe deri\·ed qnalltities; au<l there are e\·en a few instances where 8 is derived from relath·e measures of F aud H. No attempt was made to till in by computation the third quantity from the utL.-r two values, bnt the quantity was inserted when found already computed, and in some cases when specially needed. If the ,·ertical component of the intensity is required, it may be computed from one of the following relations: V = F sin 0= II tan fl= Jl<':!=H2 further we have also the simple relations:

All relative intensities were converted into absolute measures and expressed in terms of the English units-the foot, the grain, and the second of mean time; results expressed in Gaussian or Freuch units, and in the British .Association or centimetre-gramme-second (or C. G. S.) units, were all changed to conform to the majority of cases, in which the English units were employed. On the maps wllich show the distribution of the horizontal aud tota1 intensities, referred to the epoch 1885.0, the centimetre-gramme-second (or C. G. S.) units are also introduced. (See figures within parentheses.)

'l'he geographical divisions (50 to 56) comprise only sncb foreign parts contiguous to the United States which it appeared desirable to include for tl1e study of the secular change of the magnetic elements or which would be useful in the coustructiou of isomagnetic charts. Considerable labor was .involn·d by the adoption of these divisions, since many of the States and Territories had no se,parate existence at the time when the earlier observations were recorded. In each diYision tile arrangement of the stations is b.r latitude, which offers advantages due to the circumstance that the isoclinic and iso<lynamic curves intersect the parallels of latitude generally at an acute angle. The latitudes and longitudes as ginn in the original publicationl'! were scrutinized and corrected when possible, and in particnhlr the tele[.!;raphi1: lougitudes were introduced either directly or difforentialls; nnertheless tl1ere are many placel".! whose positio11s are still imperfectly known for want of prop('!' sun·e~,s. 'l'o a\·oitl tlle large numher of minus signs the longitude columns are headt·cl "v"\'i>st lougitmle," except for the 1lh·isiow; Alaska and Eastern Siberia, where the west lnugitndet< han~ !wen di1'ting11iKl1Nl hy a-, thl.' pa,;t Jon1:dti1de'\ by a+ sign, in conformity with the dt·cision of thP fnternational .Meridian Coufl'rt-uct> lwld at Wnshin~t-0n in October, 1884. A few dips, originall_, recortled in eentesimal 1h·gr.-es, were changed to the usual division of the quadrant. For the change of rclati\·e into absnlnte measure of intensity the data will generally be found in the original publications, or else they wt·re l'mbseqnently added and referred to in the last column of the table. M~ny of the intensiti~s of the Canadian stations were expressed in relative measure, and it wall a fortunate circumstance that Sir J. H. Le fro.r's work," Diary of a Magnetic SurYC.Y of-a Portion of tbe Dominion of Canada, &c., in the years 1842-'44:," wndon, 1883, a.ppea.red in

SECULAR VARIA'l'ION OF THE MAGNETIC DIP IN THE UNITED ST.A.TES.

At the time of the appearance of Appendices Nos. 32 and 33, Coa'!t Survey Report for the year 1856, which contain a first discuasion, hy the writer, of observed dips, the facts known respecting the secular variation of the dip within the limits of the United States were very meager and in part conjectural. Prof. E. Loomis appea,rs t-0 !Jave been the first to give attention to the subject. He remarks (Silliman's Journal, 1838), "From the course of the observations made in other places by Profess01· Bache it may be inferred that the dip in 1834 was at Cambridge 730 33', being an increase since 17o3 of 30 52', or about 4~' per year. It may be considered as established that the dip has increai;ed ia this country since the earliest obser\'ations, but whether it is still increasing. at the µr·eseut time seems more uncertain." "The observations made at Albanj· aud New York may excite a suspicion that such is not the fact. It is hoped that so important a question will not long remain doubtful." It may be remarked to this that the supposed increase in the dip must probably be referred back to the first quarter or earlier part of the present century, and that tlie Cambridge ob8ervations of 1780-'83 are looked upon with doubt as to their reliability; at any rate they cannot be reconciled with our present knowled~·e of the secular change. It is true they were formerly supposed the earliest known recorded dips in the country, a distinction which now must be aecorded, however, to Unalashka (li78), lrnt there were no other obsen·ations ou or near our Atlantic coast till 1822, thus cutting off the means of comparison and verification. In his second collection of dips (Silliman's Jourual, 1840), Profel\80r Loomis arrives atm ore certain results by comparing Long's dips of 1819 with others of 1839, where he notice:s a difference of 30', and saJ·s, ''In the absence, then, of more accurate data we may call this the diminution of the dip from 1819 to 1839, being at the rate of l.'5 per year." Again, comparing tlle dips in New York by Sir E. Sabine ancl Sir J. Franklin (1~22 to 1825) with his own and others about the epoch 1835, he finds a difterence of 25' and concludes a diminution of 2.'l per annum and assumes the mean between the two determinations, or 1.'o, to be the annual diminution of the dip for the (~astern) United States. Taking up the subject iq_ 1856, I showed that in the Northeastern part of the country the dip continued to decrease till about the year 1843, when the dip became stationary; the occurrence of this mimimnm was fixed at 1842.7 ±0.7, and it was further shown that since the reversal of the motion at that epoch the dip had alreacly attaiued, in 1856, an a\·erage annual increase of 2.'7, and it was conjectured that the formulre gi\·en for the secular variation wonld apply, for ten or fifteen years after this minimum epoch. Subsequent obsenations, howev~r, did not verify this range of applicability, as we shall presently see. This increase of the dip became first apparent at the magnetic observatory at Toronto, Oanada~ and Colonel Sabine remarks (Vol. II of tile Toronto Observations, Loudon, 1853): '"On a first inspection of the values of the inclination in the years from 1841 to 185~, inclusive, we might be led to infer that in 1843 or 1844 the Recular change at Toronto reached a turning epoch, and that from having been previously a de<.,Tease it became subsequently an increase of inclination. It is possible, however, that the facts may admit, and may hereafttir receive, a different explanation." In the year 1855 Prof. Ohr. Hausteen published three articles in the Astronomische Nachrich.ten (Nos. 947, 948, and 954) ''On the variations of the magnetic inclination in the northern temperate zone." To these papers reference was made by me in 1856, since they include the two stations, New York and Sitka. For the former place the analytical formula. produces a maximum for 1822.3± 1.1; I am, however, inclined to think that this maximum happened earlier. For the latter place his formula gives a minimum in 1838.8± 6.4, but I think there is little probability that this has any rela.tion to the minimum noticed at stations in the Ea.stern section of the country. Coming now to later researches, the occurrence of this minimum about 1840 to 1844 was certainly as unexpected as subsequently the sudden stoppage of the increasing dip about 1859 in the Eastern part of the United States.. Reasoning by analogy from what we knew of the long period of the secular variation in the declination and the long continued variation in the dip at certain stations, tho' not within our geographical limits, it was reasonable to expect that the increase in

the dip would continue to be obserrnd at least for many years. This idea, however, was quickly dispelled and since abont lSfiO the dip in nearly all parts of the Uitited States has again resumed the direction of diminishing >alue, thus suggesting the idea of a secondary motion or wave of comparativel_y short dnration and of a clrnracter opposite to the general motion in the ''ariatio11 of the dip, as it existed before and after thiR temporary interruption. Tbc observations made.at Washiugton (see Coast Survey Rtiport for 1870, Appendix No.14) first indi<~ated, in 18(i0, a change in the sign of the annual progreRsion, which change was soon confirmed b,1 the ohserYations at Eastport, Me., at Ke~· \Vest, Fla., and at Toronto, Canada. At Wm;hi11gton arnl Toronto the former annual increase. cea;;ed about. 18fi!l, and the annual decrease, which soon after set in, seems to have rapidly spread over the whole country, though apparently it. only rrache<l Sou them Cali· fornia at a much latur time. A~n anntial diminution is now the rule and it appliPR afao to Cana1la and a part of the Briti;;h North American Possessions; th mi at Lake Athaba;;ca, Sir J. H. Lef'roy remarks in hi" "Diar,\' of a Magnetic Survey of a Portion of the Dominion of Canada, chiefly in the Northwestern Territories, etc." (London, 1883): ''If we may asRnnw that thiR element (the dip) attained its maximum value at J,ake Athabasca at the same epoch as it <li<l at Toronto (185H) it was probably again the ;;ame in 1874 as it was in 1844, and we have, therefore, for the present rate of secular change of dip in that quarter -1.'7 per anuum." When we eutt"r more m i1111t1~ly iuto tlie investigation of the law of secular change we find the same to be dependent, as in the case of the change in declination, on the latitude and longitude of the place, aJHI it will be de;;irable to diYide the total geographical area into sep;1 rate arpas possessing it ;;im1lar charactensti0 with respect to the secular variatiou. A.n examination of the figures of Table II (given further on) which were extract~d from the general Table I, will show the difti. cnlt.Y in recogniziug the true law of change in consequence of obscuration by defecti n' Yalues, <hit~ either to indift'ereut obserYations, to detectiYe needles, or more generally to local effects from cbauge of place. To m·ercome this difficulty the dips llt the yarious places and included iu a certain region were plotte<l on the Rame scale and for-the same time ordinates, by which means it became poHiihle to recognize any common feature. as well as any defective obsen·ation, yet considerable !lifficnlties were encountered in understanding and extracting the law from scanty, conflicting, or otherwise confusing data, as those, for instance, in the West Indies and California. ·with bnt a very few exceptions we have to contend with au insufficient number of obseiTations as well as with a want of equal dh;trilmtiou in time, t>ven O\'er tbe short period at prescut at our command, uor can we feel quite sure of having- Reized the correct interpretation iu all cases. '\Ve shall first gh·e in tabular form, aud conYeniently arranged for computation, the observed <lips at !Hadi11g Rtati011s, selected from those of Table I in consequence of their fitues'I for the im·estigatiou of tl1e ~ecular rnriation or of the present annual change. For some of these stations the dips have also been expresSl·d b,v means of an exponential function (as had hec11 !lnne iu 185G). Such exprcssio11s a11pl~· 011ly for a ver_y limited time but they will enable ns to refer oh~errnti111s to any desired epoch, "itbi11 their proper range of applicability, for which it may he i11tt<mled to chart the i8oclinics. 111 est.ablisliing these equatious for dip we han~ n;;ed the method of least squares, and 11all also resort to otherwiM· intt>rpolated values to fill up gaps in time or defecbi in extent of series, thns simpls trying to make the best of imperfect material. 'l he formnlm im·olved ma~· be briefly recapitulated as follows: Let fi =the dip at any time t where t i8 expressed in ~·ears and fractions of ·1 ,Vt>ar.

·rhe obsen'ations at Halifax, Quebec and Montreal are insufficient for presentation in an
anal~·tical

form; but the latest observations at these places agree in indicating an apparently uniform decrease of dip between 1860 and 1880, viz:

,
At Halifax, itisoo to 1882 = - 2.3 At Quebec, a111110 to 1880 = -1.6 At Montreal, a 1858 to 1880 = -1.2
The value of a 1885 is probably slightly greater in each case. There is a faint indication of the seoandary minimum (about 1838 to 1844), referred to above. For the stations Cambridge and Boston, New Haven, Albany and Greenbush, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Toronto, Cleveland, Detroit and Saint Louis, we have a general likeness in the featnreR of the secula.r variations,.i. e., they exhibit the secmul.ary minimum, for which we find, on the average, the epoch 1840.5 ± 2.0 years, and they show the subsequent secondary maximum, which we find t.o have occurred, on the average, in 1860.0 :I: 3.5 years. If this subordinate wave be persistent, its period would be about 39 :I: 8 years. Its range is barely one-quarter of a degree. After the occurrence of the maximum, and up to the present time, there is noted a regular decrease of dip a.t all the stations.

011 the western coast, could not be established in consequence of the imperfections of the data, though it will be seen further on that the observations of the horizontal force admitted of such tabulation. Turning- to the Southern States and the West India Islands and Mexico, we 61ul at Fernandina and Key West, Fla., the dip ap[1arelltly to have been slowly decreasing since about 1860. In I.ouisiana it would seem t1lat the dip has recently bee.n stationary, the latest observations at New Orleans and Southwest Pass apparently pointing to a slight increase at present. whereas in Texas, at Dollar Point, near Gal vest.on, ohservations show a decided increase of dip. Thus in passing from the eastern t-0 the western gulf coast the present slight decrease in Florida vanishes and reverses in Louisian~t, and becomes an increase in Texas. In other wor<ls, the subordinate extreme in these latitudes has just been passed in the east but bas not yet been reached in the west. In the West Indies and l\lexico it is difficult to recognize what has been going on in the dip in eom1eqneuce of the contrndictory testimony of the observations, but forming a geneml idea of the ehange from comparison of all the stations it would appear that in the region bounded by Nassau, Havana, and Saint 'l'l10ma.s the dip is at prl~sent nearly statiouary or persisting about an extreme phase. In Mexico and Central America, or in the region including Panama, Acapulco, Mexico, mid San Elai;;, the 1iata are more definite and the dip appears to have been increasing throughout this century, but the maximum bas probabl.Y not yet been reached. , In connection with the above it ma,y be stated that at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the change in the dip is no less remarkable than the change iu the declination; we are here presented with a stead.v increa.se of north dip between I1a Caille's observation in 1751 · (dip= - 200 0') and Hnrkuess's observation in 1866 (dip= -110 47'), and the Harne phenomenon is noted at Valparaiso, Chili, between the observations of Malaspina· in 1793 (dip= - 44° 58'), and Harkness's observation of 18Hli (dip=_ 350 23'). No such large changes have been observed within the area of the United Stat.es. A.t Havana the present a1inual change is probabl,v le.ss than + 0'.8, at Acapuleo about +1'.0, at Mexico and Sau Blas it may be +1'.5 to +2'.0, but at Magdalena Bay, Lower California, Mexico, the annual change seems to have become zero at present. Passing north to the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington Territory we meet with several cases of embarrassing discordant observations; nevertheless we can clt>,arly 1liscern that at San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, an(t Monterey the dip a.t present undergoes either no or but a very slight annual change. The state of the dip at San Francisco, at Oape Disappointment (mouth of the Columbia River), and at Fort Vancouver is probably just past the extreme and is very slowls decreasing, though we are unable t-0 assign the amount. Over the vast regions in British North America north of the boundary of Dakota and extending to the shores of Hudson's Bay, aorl embracing Lake Winnipeg, observations at York Fact-Ory

and at the Norway and Cumberland houses make it appear that the dip is now not very different from what it wa;; forty years ago, and probably it, has undergone but little change , nring the interval; in this region the present annual change is supposed rnrJ small. Further west, at Fort Uhipewyan, Fort Edmonton, and Fort Lesser Slave Lake the annual change may be about - 0'.5 At Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island, tile dip is 011 tlw decrease, abont -0'.7 for the ii>llmd; further north along the coast at Port Simpson the annual change seems to he abont. -1' .5 . H seenu; certain that in Alaska the dip has been deereasing siuce (about) 185:!, with an annual rate varying between -2'.2 at Sitka, -1'.5 at Unalashka, -1'.0 at Port Olarence, near Bering Strait, and -1'.2 at Point Barrow. Crossing the strait to Asia the observed dips at PetroJlaYlovsk, Kamchatka, strongly mark out a maximum about 1854, which appears supported by the dips at, Port Clarence, as had also been conjectured· for Point Barrow. Tlie Gnalasbka dips appear to be tlifticmlt to reconcile with dips at. surroundi11g stations. Snpp<>sell present annual change of dip at Petropavlovsk -1.'5, the same as at Unalashka. With the aid of the preceding results we can roughly trace out tLe region o\·er which the dip is at present stationary, or wheni the annual change ii' zero. This region is ma.rked on the accompanying chart by a shaded band skirti11g the northern coaRt of Cuba, passiug oYer lower Louisiana and central Texas, through Mexico, crossing the Gulf of Ualifornia, followiug the coast of Southern California, anti passiIJg out to sea off Sau Francisco. Ever.rwliere north of this belt of 1lemarcation the dip is diminishing, south or it increasing in consequence of secular variation, arnl curves of equal a.nnual cha.nge in its Yicinity woulcl run 11earl,\ parallel to it. · The results of the preceding im·estiga·ion suppliecl the uieams b,v which tbe ob:sen·ed dips were referred to the common rpoeh 1.-.:85.0, as given in Table I, and, in co11nectiou with it, it 1mffices tO State ~hat for each Station the latest obserYatiOU was Used, or in case Of Revera! late ohserVatiOllS each was reduced to the epoch and the mean inserted in the table. A blauk i11dicates insufficient data for reduction and the mm of a single decimal that the dip is only roughJ.r kuown. It may not be out of place here to offt-.r a few remarks respecting the pre:sent po:sitiou or the pole of the vertical di[). Physicists are not agreed whether this pole is fixed in position or whet bet it is in motion, and if the latter, what is the direction and ,·elocity of the change. It is now over half a century since Ross made his memorable and successful approach to tltis point and fount! it t (.Tune, 1~31) in <p= 700 05'.3, ii.= - 900 45'.8, and no serious attempt has since been made eitl.Jer to verifj· it or to tlernonstrate IJ.Y actual ol>senatio1; a11,r cllaugc iu it.s position. l t seews pcrLaps more reasonable to suppose its range of 1fo;plact-111e11t to be quite limited than to assigu to it, a:; has been done, a path surrounding the geographical pole, and to be described iu several ceututieg, Observations made on board Her Majesty's ship Brazen in 1813 poiuted to apµroacl.tiug verticality in <p = 69° and;\= -92°; aud more rect-utly, from the behavior of his compass, Lieutenant ~ehwatka supposes the pole in 1879 to have 8hifte1l toil= - 99° ::15', while he leaves any chauge in its latitmle undecid1·d. If the secular diminution of tile dip extentlis to this uorthern regiou the pole would now be found in a higher latitude tba11 that given by Ro.ss, but of this we are not certain. We regar·I the practical solution of tbis problem as one of great importance for the theory of terrestrial magnetism, and it is to be regretted that no steps- were taken towar.t its soJu. tfon iu conuec·tion witb tbe late international circumpolar explorations. Science at the present <lny, however, would not be satisfied with a single line of approach to a dip of OOo, as in 1831, but the whole region would nee.I exploration since local uetlectious ma)· vitiate or obscure the recoguition of the true place of verticality.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY. PART III.

SECULAR. VARIATION OF THE HORIZONTAL COMPONENT OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE AND OF THE TOTAL INTENSITY IN THE UNITED STATES.

It was not until 1833 that Gauss showed· how the earth's magnetic i11tensity could be expressed in absolute measure; and in 1836 Webert constructed the portable magnetometer. Before this time no satisfactory investigation or inquiry could be made respecting either supposed changes or permanency of the maguetic intensity. Although relative intensity measures had been made as early as 1785, no definite results could be arrived at respecting changes in the intensity of the force in consequence of the unknown, gradual and irregular loss of magnetism of the needles employed in these comparisons. The range of time over which our knowledge of the intensity iihus practically extends is barely half a century, though some rough guesses may ht> made as to earlier results. A firRt investigation of the secular variations of the horizontal component and of the total force was attempted by me in Appendix No. 22, Coast Survey Report for 1861. In consequence of the scanty material then at command a11d the large relative size of observing errors as compared with the effect of the secular chauge, no very decided results were reached. It appeared, however, that in the eastern parts of the United States, during the twenty ;rears then passed, the horizontal component of the force had been decreasing at an annual rate of about 0.001 parts of the force, and that in the western part of the country the horizontal force had been increasing at an annual rate a trifle greater tha11 that just given. The direct evidence as to a change in total intensity was inconclusive; however, it was certainly very small, whatever its character may have been. It was soon noticed that in the east the secular diminution in the horizontal component had come to an end about 1855 or 1860 (at Washington and at Toronto), and that after this a steady increast1 of this component set in which has continued to the present time. Respecting the Recular variation of the total foroo, we know from the earliest records at W a.shin gt on and at Toronto that the intensity was subject to a slow decrease. In the preface to his "Diary of a Magnetic Survey of Canada," Sir J. H. Lefroy remarks (in 1883), "The general evidence is concluflive that in middle latitudes on the American contiuent the intensity of the earth's magnetic force is now decreasing and has been decreasing for about thirty-five years," a conclusion which was supported by receutly (1882) published results of the Coast an<l Geodetic Sun'ey. In the same volume Ge11eral Lefroy takes occasion to 1mint out a needed correction to the isodyuamic lines in Northwest America a8 laid down from observations by Sir Edward Sabine in Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., vol. for 1872, and <lraws attention to the remarkable development of maguetic (tot.al) forct1 on the eastern side of Lake Winnipeg. A 1·esurny of this region and a first survey of the vast area to the east of it, between the northern shore of Lake Superior and Georgian Bay and the southern and western Ahores of Huclson's Bay is absolutely indispensable if we desire an adequate knowledge of the region of great intensity and of the locus and amount of its maximum value. The leading 8tations selected for the investigation of the secular variation of the horizontal intensity are the same as those given in connection with the discussion of the changes of the dip.

To ascertain in general the characteristic features of the change in the horizontal component., the observed values of H were plotted for each stfltion. It theu became apparent that, perhaps wltb the exception of a fow statious, the observed data were insufficieut to trace out the law with distinctness at any one station, but that c-0Uectively fairl;\· satisfactory results could be had. Three distinct types of change conlcl be recognized, and the stations exhibiting like types were grouped and their results united into a mean, as shown in the following table. The values of H, as tabulated for every fifth year, are the result of a free-baud cun·e. drawn among the dots representing the observed valu&11 in order that their accidental errors may be eliminate(! as far as possible. The observations at tibe three Canadiau r,itations, Halifax, Quebec and Monkeal, were found tOO irregular to be combined; they concur, howe\·er, in indicating increasing force since lt)60 or some earlier date. The stations in the West Indies, Central America, and Mexico likewise could not be treated in t;he manner proposed, from insufficiency of observations, but they clearly indicate

In Alaska, likewise, t~e horizontal component is apparently at prel§ent decreasing.

For British North America our data are insufficient to give any definite information of the character of the change during the last forty yearR, and apparently the present horizontal inten· sities bave again nearly ap11roached the values they bad at tbe earlier epoch. The same uncertainty prevails for the Territory of Alaska respecting the past as well as the present changes in the values of H. AnalogouR to the region of stationary dip we also recognize, but much les:s distinctly, a broad belt stretching aeross the country in a northwesterly and southeasterly direction, in which tbt1 horizontal component is at present stationary, or where the annual· hange of the horizontal foroo is nil. This region passes, roughly speaking, through western Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, 'Missouri, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida, possibly with a width of two hundrt·d statute miles or moi;-e. This broad belt, therefore, does not coincide iu position with a similar belt of unchangeable dip at the present time. To the northward and eastward of this belt of demarkation, as shown on the aooompaoying map, the horizontal component is in a state of increase, to the southward and westward of it in a state of decrease. In eithM case the annual change, as also in the CMe of the

272

UNI:rED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

annual change of the dip, becomes greater the farther a place is distant from the respective marked regions of constancy.

SEOULA.R VARIATION OF TRE DIRECTION OF .A. FREELY SUSPENDED MAGNETIC NEEDLE.

Quite an instructive diagram may he cOJH'ltructed by combining the secular \·ariations of the declination and of the dip so as to show the actual secular motion of the direction of a magnetic needle when freely sm;pentled.· Conceive a sphere described with any c011\·enient radius about the center of gravity of the needle, and suppose th11t portion of its inner surface viewtd (from the center) toward which the north end of the needle may be pointiug-. Producing the direction of the north end of the needle, as observed at any gi\'en epoch, it will interl:!ect the sphere in a given point, and a series of such pointi:; will be bad if this be repeated for a number of epochs. A curve freely drawn through these consecuth·e points will theu represent the actual secular motion in the direction of the needle, and way be projectt·d on a plane, tangent to the SJ>here at a point near the middle of the region. For our illustration we select the group of northeastern stations and designated as type I, the a\·erage geographical position for which corresponds approximately to central Conneeticut.

Suppose radius of sphere= 4

degree of a great circle would have the length

5~.3

nearly, or 6.98 cm., and one degree of a parallel for average dip of 730 would eqnal 6.98 cos 73°, or 2.04 cm. The diagram is constructed accordingly;· the degrees marked on the right·hitnd margin are those of the dip, dimin-ishing upwards; the degrees marked at the bottom are those of the declination, increasing to the left or u:estu:ard. Plottiug the typical values of dip and declination for every fifth year between 1830 aud 1885, and uniting the points so obtained by a free-baud curve, we have the representation of the secular motion of a freely suspended needle, as shown in the accompanying diagra.m. The dotted part between 1820 nnd 1830 is doubtful, only one of the coordinates being known with certainty. In its further extension into past time the curve is known to be a tangent to the Yertical line of 4°.9 in or.about the year 1794 (see Tablfl III of Appendix 12, Report for 1882), and it is here where we regret most the total absence of information respecting the state of the dip, and which debars ns from even conjecturing the course of the curve during the past century, though it lies wholly to the westward of the vertical touched in 1794. The secular variation in the total intensity might also be indicated iu the diagram by variation in the tliickness of the curve. The change, however, is of a very simple nature, and it suffices to state that since about· 1870 the magnetic force has been rapidly declining in intensitr.
CONS'.1.'RUCTION OF ISOMAGNETIC MAPS OF THE UNITED STATES, SHOWING THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE DIP AND OF THE HORIZONTAL COMPONENT AND TOTAL VALUE OF THE EARTH'S :MAGNETIC INTENSITY, FOR THE EPOCH JANUARY 1, 1885.

· It is not our purpose to review here in particular any one of the isomagnetic .maps that have been constructed from time to time since the production of the first isnclinic map by Wilh, in 1768, and the firstiaodynamicmap by Humboldt, which was based upon his American observatiorns, made between 1799and1804; but we shall briefl.y refer to some maps more s1wcially related to the Unitell States or covering parts of its territory. We need but mention, as claiming now but little attention in consequence of their neeessary · imperfections, the isoclinic maps published by Hansteen iu the first quarter of the present centnr.v. That for the epoch 1600 is based on the dip observations of Hudson aml Baffin; that. for 1700 on obserrntions of Cunningham, Feuillee, La Caille, and Ekeberg ; that for 1780 on obserYationH hy Cook and I...a Perouse. GansN, in his great work on the-General Theo1·y of Terrestrial Magnetism, obtains bis data for the inclination mainly from Iforner'i. map (date about 1827), a111.l for the inteusitJ.es (total)· from the admirable map published by Major E. Sabine (Report of the Seventh Mt'eting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Vol. VI, London, 18:~8). No strict re. duction to a fixed epoch was then practicable, and the results group themselves, on the avnage, near or before the year 1830, as a rough epoch. The maps of the values of the inclination and of the horizontal force, computed according to the theory of Gauss, are contained in Taylor'l'l Scientific Memoirs, Vol. Il, Part VII, London, 1841.

UNITED ST.ATES CO.AST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

In the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society for 1840 Major Sabine gives two chartR, entitled "Magnetic Isocli11al Lines i11 the Atlantic, 1837," amt" Maguet ic Isodynamic Lines in the Atlantic, 1837." The first of these special charts only reaches the eastern bQrder of the Uniteu States. In Sillimau~s Journal, 183:"., Art. III, Prof. E. Loomis laid down the lint>R of equal dip for every 50 for the eastern part of tlle United States, hut disclaims an~· great precision for them; again, in SiIJimau's ,Jourual, Vol. XXXIX, 1840, he gi\es a map of equal dip for the epoch 1840, with the remark that the lines in the northeastern part are fairly accurate, out those in the southeastern part in a measure conjectural. ·Appendix No. 28 of the Coast, Survey Report for 1856, by Superinkmlent A. D. Bache and Assistant J. E. Hilgard, is accompanied by a small map showing for tlie epoch 18.jO the distribution of the inclination and of tbe horizontal intem·ity along a narrow strip of our Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, ~nd along the Mexican boundary. lll tlie Coast Survey [{('port for 1~62 Superintendent .A. D. Bache gives a mail of Pennsylvania, showing for the epoch 18,12 the 11istrilmtio11 of the dip, the horizontal and total intensity for that State. The contributious to terrestrial magnetism, Nos. XUI and XIV, by GenPral Sir E. Sabine, in tbe Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. for 1872 and 1875, contain most valuable maps, forming part of the representation of the magnetic condition of the earth's surface about the epoch ll'i40-'45. Plate XLIX in the volume for 1872 shows the distribution of the inclination on a circumpolar map down to north latitude 350, and Plate L the distribution of the total intensity within the same limits. To complete the work for the northern hemisphere, Plates Nos. 27 and 28, Phil. Trans. of 1875, exhibit the distribution of these same elements for tile zone betwet-n north latitude 40° aud tlle equator. On these maps we find marked, besides the curves of definite ,·alues, the position and value for each individual station. The latest published charts are those by General Sir J. H. Lefroy in bis "Diary of a Magnetic Sarvey in Canada, &c.," London, 1883. These are on a comparatively large scale, so as to permit, in regions where the magnetic stations were numerous, the representation of the larger. local deflections. The 1·un-es, consequently, do not show that symmetry or uuifonnity which forms so familiar a feature of the older charts. There are four, all for the epoch 1844; the mines of the inclination, and of the total intensity are given for each station, with curves for intervals of oue degree and of 0.5 (English) units, respectively. Plate V includes the region of our 11orthwestern hom1dary from Lake Superior to th~ Pacific, where it extends down to the central latitmie of Oregon; Plate VI comprises all that part of tl1e United States l~'ing between th~ States of 1\faine, 5orth Carolina, Missouri, and Minnesota. Notwithstanding the fact that dip observations date Lack fully three centuries, and relative intensity obsen·ations just one century, and that we have absolute measure for a little more than half that time, we cannot utilize all the material here collected for the purpose of giving gTt>at<·r completeness or ~reater precision to our charts, but mm·t contei1t oursel ,·es with using only those observations which are of recent date. Otherwise there would be great liability to error in consequence of defective reduction to epoch, onr present knowledge of the secular variation being inadequate in range and amount. In regions where we ham imperfect or no knowledge of the secular change of either element the fact is indicated in their graphical representatiou by dotted lines, and in the tabular statement it is indicated by the result being given with one place of decimals less than tbeusnal number. Numbers within parentheses were not used at all, these rernlts having been recognized as defective. The observations in the Territory of Alaska are yet too scanty for satisfactory charting. For the plotting of the positions and obser,-ed values of the stations on the three maps I am indebted to Mr. A. Ziwet, of the Computing Division. Upon the whole, the representation of the dip for the 1>poch 1885 is far more satisfactory than the representation of the liorizontal intensity for the same epoch, and it appeared plain t>nough that the cause wns to be found m defective determination of the instrumental constants required for the latter measure. · In conclusion, we regard the compila.tion and discussion oi the magnetic dips and intensities herewith presented as of more permammt value than the mere reduction to epoch and their charting, which latter operations ma.,v be much better pt·rformed after the lapse of some years, when the law of secular variation shall have become better understood.

COLLECTION OF SOME MAGNETlC VARIATIONS OFF THE COASTS OF CAUFORNIA AND MEXICO, OBSERVED BY SPANI:'<H NAVIGATORR IN THE LAST QUARTER 01'' THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.
Comn-.unicated by GEORGI<: DAVIDSON, Assistant.

This p:q)er contaim; t>xeerpts from the logs of certain Spanish vessels which sailed from the ports of Sau Luca~;, Lower California, and San Blas, Mexico, in tbe years 1774 to 1790, giving the magnetie variation at <liffereu t parts of the vo,yage. The notes are from au English rnauuscript translation of a Spauisb manuscript copy of the original docu111e11t8. 'l'IH'rc i8 no meution, as far as seeu, of the way in which the \'ariatious were ob'.niued, uor any exphrnation of the asterisk (4") which distinguishes some of them. , These docum1·uts in Spanish are copies of the manuscript documents in the State Department at Vlasliiug:ton, am1 \Hre fun1ished to me some _years since. Those in the State Department were copied trom tlu~ archin·s at Madrid pending the question of the northwest boundary of the United States. The talmlatiou is made only on tlwse dates when the ;·ariation apJJears in the proJJer column, and I suspect that i;ome of tl.Je gin·n Yariations are h1terpolated, unless we Ruppose that tlies as regularly ooser,·ed the sun for azimuth as for position. I think it probable that the atar (·) to an observation means that the azimuth was determined froin observations on a star instead of the sun. The uotes as to seeing la11d, &c., will in a rough way check the longitudes, which are crude at the Yery uest; in oue case they found th~ml.'leh·es 90 in error, but the lamlfall checks it. I am indebted to Assistaut C. a. Schott for filling in the column beaded "Longitude west from Gfre-1wiel1." He as~rnmed for the lougitncle of San Lucas - 1090 54', and for the longitude of San Blas- 1050 17', witll a probable uncertaint~· of::!:: 0'.5, and the figures given are those resulting from the atldition or suhtractiou (as tlie cmm may lw) of the diflerential valuJ>s of the preceding column to 01 from one or the othel' of thcl:le absolute longitudes.

GEOGRAPHICAL POSITIONS OF' TRIGONOMETRICAL POINTS IN THI<; STATES OF MA8SACHTTSETTS AND RHODE ISLAND, DETERMINED BY THE UNfTEll STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SERVEY RETWEEI\ THE YEARS 18:35 AND lOBG, AND INCLUDING THOSE DETEltl\iINED BY THE BORDEN 8URVEY IN THE YEARS 183~ TO l8:3tl. INTRODUCTION AND EXPLANATION OF THE T.1BLE OP POSlTIU_?\'S.
By CHARLES A. SCHOTT. AssiE<tant.

The geographical positions herewith prPsented are located in the States of Massaclrnsetts and Rhode Island, and are the results to date of the cnmputation and final adjustment of the primary and subordinate triangulations carried on by the Dnite(l States Coast and Geodetic Surny between the years 1835 and 1885; to these ha Ye been added the results from a recompntation of the earlier triangulation, executed by Mr. Simeon Borden, by authority oftht'. State of Massachusetts, between the years 1832 and lb.38, and comprising all of hjs principal points, the records of many of the sub· orrlinate points not having heen recoverable. All results depend on the standard geodetic data of the Survey, viz: Unit of length.-Tbe metre, anrl in particular the French committee (iron) metre brought here by Superintendent F. R. Hassler; see Appeiirlix No. 7, Coast Survey Report for 1867. Surface of reference.-Tbe spheroid of rotation deduced by Captain A. R. Clarke, R. E., in lb66, as resembling most nearly the earth's size and figure; see comparisons of stamlardR of length, etc., J,ondon, 1866; also Appendix No. 7, Coast and Geodetic Survc;i· Report for 1881. The standard latitt.(,de.-Is the same as that of the primary triangulation of the Atlantic Coast, viz: Principio (p0 =39° 35' 30".6!!2; see Appendix No. 8, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1879. The standard azimuth.-ls the same as that of tl1e primary triangulation, viz: Principio to Turkey Point a 0 =lo 34' 36".413; see above report. The standard longitude.-Is the telegraphic longitude of the North American system, dppeuding directly on Greenwich, England, for which see the above report, also Appendix No. 11, Coast a.nd Geodetic Survey Report for 1884. "\Ve have for Principio 11-0=76° 00' 16".407 west from Greenwich. The former publications by this office of positions in the two States, in Appendix No. 12, Coast Survey Report for 1851, Appendix No. 15, Coast Survey Heport for 1864 and Appendix No. H, Coast Survey Report for 1868, are therefore superseded, as based upon a different spheroid as well as upon different standard data, nor had these old retSu!ts been thoroughly adjusted. Respecting elevations of points above the average tidal le,·el of the Atlantic, their publication must be reserved for a later time, when additional data wi1l be available for a reduction and discussion of the ·ertical measures of the Survey. Descriptions of stations can generally be furnished by the office on application. The method of treatment of the observations by the computer may in general be briefly stated as follows: Starting from the results of the primary triangulation known as the oblique arc of the .Atlantic, where the same crosses the boundaries of the States of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and inclusive of the subordinate primary triangulations of these States, the position of that particolar trigonometrical station which is connected mt>st strongly with the main triangulation is

first fixed by adjustment, taking into consideration the lines directed to it from primary stations as well .ms lines diverging from it auil inter;;ecti11g- the latter. Should tht>re be more than one such point, say two or more, having eqnal strength of l~ounection, they are treated together iu one least square adjustment. In this mauuer point after point is adjusted in position, so that the sum of the squares of the corrections to the observed horizontal directions shall be a ruinimum; - the geometrical relations of the preceding jiointio; being always considered as fixed with respect to the varial>le element;; of the new point under treat111 ent. The principal secondary stations having thus become known in position, the tertiary positions are determined in tlte same systematic though somewltat, less elaborate manner than that followed for the secondaries, but generally without least square adjustment. The final result of tllis systematic treatment may be summarized by stating that no discrepa11c.r remains iu the rP>mlts themselves, aJJcl that the length and direction of any side· of a t!iaugle rnay be computed from anJ· starting side, aml through any series of connecting · triangles, and yet the isame results will be reached. Tlte triangulation of the State of l\1aissaclmsetts by S. Borden was well executed in its time; yet material strength was given to it l>y tl1e introduction of numerous Coast and Geodetic Survey lines, serving as so mall;\" base lines, and h,r developiug the same on Clarke's spheroid with the astronomical standard data of the Coast and Gemletic Survey. Tims modernized and strength· eued, it i:s as serviceable 110w as then. In consequence of its less perfect measures in the earlier years and in particular covering that part of the triangulation which lies in the vicinity of the base, that length was deduced from the Coast and Geolletic Survey work; but it proved so nearly identical ""ith the result of the <lirect measure by Mr. Borden that the condition of perfect accord was included in the figure adjustment aud satisfted. The latitudes and longitntles of the trigonometrical points were computed by the usual formulre, aided ll,y the tables or<linaril;\· employed in the Survey, for which see Appendix No. 7, Coast and Geodetic l::)urvey Heport for 1884. For primary sides, not exceeding in length (s) 100 or 150 kilometres (about 62 or 93 statute mile:,;), the formnlre for difference of latitude Ll<p, difference of longitude Lllt, and difference of azimuth Lla, are very accurate or sufficiently perfect for the purpose; they are:·
( L1 <p =

hence the results for tlte new position

For sides not exceeding 25 or 30 kilometres (about 15 or 19 statute miles) the fourth term in the expression for Ll<p may be omitted, also the factor sec i (Llcp) and the second term in the expression for Lla. For full explanation, forms, examples, and auxiliary tables, the reader may consult the Appendix cited above. There also is showu the inverse problem, viz: given <p and A, and <p' and A.' (or <p, cp', and .di..) to finds, a and a'. This process may be used in cases where the required distance aud azimut11s are not implicitly contained in our table of results. For a direct solution put

3 are identical in the two surveys. _A number of computers were engaged upon this work, but the priucipal sliart> of the work fell to Mr. E. H. Courteuay, of the Computing Division, to whose zeal, iudustry, and scrupulous care umcl! of tlrn accuracy of the results is due. The results now communicated were de!luced in 1884, 1885, aml part of 1886. Respectiug the accuracy of a triangulation the mean error 111 of an adjusted or resulting Q,ngle Las been ad rnutageously employed as a quantity of comparison for different triangulations by which to judge of their relatiYe Ya1ue (see, e.g., Coast and Geodetic tinryey Report for 1884, p. 389). The Yalue m 111ay be deduced in \-arious more or less accurate ways, according to circumstances; in adjusted triangulations it may be readily deduced from

where e = triangle closing error (or differen<.,'0 from 7t + i:) and to be taken with positive sign in last formula, and t = number of triangles. We thus find for the adjusted triangulation of the Coast and Geo<letic Survey, but exclusii'e of the primary triangulation, for .Massachusetts, the value of m = :±: 3".7, and for its unadjusted work m = ± 3".9; similarly for the Borden survey we find the average \'alues ± 611 .0 and m = :-!:: 611 .4 for adjt1stt>d and unadjwited work, respectively. For the !{bode Islaud tmrvey, where tb.e sides are generally short, the average value of m equals ± 5".1 The accuracy of the triangulation may otherwise be roughly expresised in terms of the distance, and thns estimated the average error of secondary work may range between 40 000 and~ of the ltmgth, while that of tertiary work ma.y be estimated as low as -ro1oco or less near its inferior limit. '!'here remain oqt a few words to be added explanatory of the table of results. Column one contains the names of the stations whicL are located in Massachusetts or 1.hode Island, as the case may be, unless otherwise indicated; Borden stations are distinguished by the addition of his name, and st11tions in common bear the mark U. & G. S. and 13.; columns three and five contain tile equi,·alents ir1 metres of tile seconds (in arc) of latitude and longitude, respectively, solely for the use of the draughtsman in projections; column six gives the azimuth of the first to the second named statiou, counted from south round by west from oo to 360°; it is followed by the reversed azimuth in the next column. The distances are all referred to the surface of the spheroid at the arnrage sea level. Those who may prefer the English foot as the unit of length can readily make the conversion from one unit into the other by means of the following tables:

RESULTS DEDTTCED PHOM THE GEODETIC CONNECTION OF THE YOLO HASE Lll'\E WITH THE PIUMARY TRIANGULATION OF CALIFORYIA. ALSO A REDUCTION ANU ADJUSTl\JgN'r OF THE ])AVlDRON Ql:AmnLATERALS FORMING PART Or' THAT TRIANGULATION.
By CHARLES A. SCHOTT, Assilitant. PREFATORY NOTE.

In this paper on the re1mlts of higher geodesy as applied to the primary triangulatio11 of California, AsRistant Schott has given a full exposition of the method employed on the Survey for tl1e computation of triangulation of the first order, and a more complete explanation than has heretofore been presented of the manner in which weights are ap1)lied to ohscn'ed directions. Appendix No. 14, Report for 1864, gives au account of the method as then introduced by Mr. Schott and nsed by him for discussing the results of tlie geodetic conuection of the Epping base with the primary triangulation of the New England States. In the paper now presented two new steps are introduced not believed to l1ave heen hitherto taken in any triangulation, viz, tl1e iutroductiou of a correction to latitudes for curvature of the ··ertical, and the reduction of horizontal directions to the sea-level of the station observed upo11. These reductions required a knowledge of the heights of the stations already given in Appendix No. IO, Report for 1884. The introduction of these refinements was justified by the magnitude and rwcuracy of the work.
COMPUTING DIVISION, CO.AST AND GEODE'.l'IC SURVEY OFFICE,

December 31, 1885. Up to the present time the geographical positions on the charts published by the Survey of th<\ region about Sau Francisco depended npou two preliminary base lines, measured respecti\·ely in 1851 and 1853, and upon a series of triangles covering the immediate coast line. This work was executed principally by the late Assistant R D. Cutts. When later it became necessary to provide for a more comprehensive scheme of triangulation, which was not only to satisfy the requirements of the western coast but also to form a part of that grander scheme of the geodetic counection of the snrn'.ys of the Atlantic aud Pacific coasts, the western part of the WOI'k was placed in charge of Assistant George Davillson, under whom it has 1Jeen prosecuted from 187G to the pl'esent time. In DeeemlJer, 1884, the field-work was so flu complete as to admit of the introduction of the primary base line measured by him in 1881 in Yolo County, in the valley of the Sacramento River, and to compute and adjust that part of the triangulation known as the Davidsou quadrilaterals, also to connect the same with this base and introduce the astronomical determiua· tions, so as to form standard geodetic data to answer for the main and subordinate triangulations of' California, as well as for its extension across Nernda iuto Utah. It is proposed to giYe a tolerabl_y complete account of the computations, in view of the importance of the work, and to take this opportunity of exhilJiting the method adopted by the Survey in dealing with the reduction of tirstclass field-work, possessing an accuracy and magnitude not surpassed anywhere. It is, however, H. Ex.18---56 441

with that step only which effectR the ascent from the base to the first primary line that we are here chiefly concerned. lteferring to plate No. 16 of this Report, entitled" Progress of the Transcontinental Triangulation," it is intended to deduce the length and probablP. error of the primary side'' Mount Helena to Mount Diablo," California, as derived from the Yolo base-measure and from the angular measures at the connecting triangulatiou points, and which it is the immediate object of our paper to exhibit; next, to do the same for the primary side" Mount Nebo-Tushar," Utah, as derived from the Utah Valley base (as yet unmeasured); and finally to compute or adjust as a whole the primary triangulation intervening between these sides and stretching over California across Nevada to the middle of Utah, a distance but little short of 600 statute miles (or about 950 kilometres), from Mount Helena, California, to Mount Nebo, Utah. The accompanying figure was taken from the plate referred to, and shows that the connection · of the base with the primary side is made through a well-shaped or wellconditioned figure decomposable intoseveralquadrilaterals,andbaving a compact area with Vaca as a central station. The length of the base· is, roughly, 10! statute miles, or about l 7k kilometret!, and the length of the primary side is nearly 67 statute miles, or 107! kilometres. · RE Yolo l1nse Every one of the trigonometrical points is an astronomical station for latitude and azimuth, as are also the adjacent primary stations, Mount. I1ola and Round Top. Two theodolites were used in the measure of the horizontal directions; diameters of graduation, 20 inches (50 cm.). They are provided with three reading microscopes, and have an eye-piece micrometer for repeating the pointings in conuection with the same circle reading. The horizontal circle was used in twenty-three positions, and ordinarily between two and three series were taken in each position of the circle, each series consisting of pointings and readings of each object in succession and in the direction of increasing circle readings, with reversal of the telescope (the same pivot remaining in contact with the same Y it rested on before reversal), and followed by similar successive observations of the objects in a direction the reverse of that first used. After the several ocular pointings were reduced to a mean value and the circle readings were corrected for rnn of screw of microscopes, the measures of the Yarious series were adjusted to give the most probable values of the several directions, together with their probable errors. Tllis 8tation or local adjustment was made in a<icordance with Bessel's method developetl in his "Gradmessung," published iu 1838, but stopping short at the point where the local weight-equations are formed, which it

was 11ot proposed to carry over to the general figure adjustment-an essential difference presently again to be referred to. An account of the local adjustment of observed directions i;; given in Appendix No. 33, Coast Surve.v Report for 1854, pages 71-76, and in many later works;" hcmce there appears to be no need for repeating it here. The probable error of a single measure of a diuectiou (i.e., the mean value derived from series, telescope direct, motion forward, and tieries telescope reversed, motion backward) is found by

All the pointings were on heliotropes. To the following abstract of resulting directions and their probable errors at each station, there has been added a further correction for elevation of the observed object above the Rea horizon, and due to the non-intersection of the verticals iu the same ~ h ~-~ point of the axi11 of tbP. spheroid; this correction t is: y · R sin 2 a cos2 <p, where e2 = a~- , h =the elevation of the ouserved point, R, =the ra.dius of curvature in the plane ilerpendicular to the meridian, <p = the latitude of the station occupied, ancl a= the azimuth of the line of sight counted from south in the direction of west to 3600. For the Clarke spheroid of 1866 and the vicinity of the parallel of 390 we have log e2 = 7.8305 and log R = 6.8054, and dividing the expression by sin 1" we ha·-e with sufficient accuracy the correction in seconds 0".000109 sin 2a cos2 <p. h, where his expressed in metres; hence, finally, 0".000066 sin 2a. h.

Since the introduction (about 1847 or 1848) of the application of the method of least squares to the adjm;tment of the principal triangulations of the Survey, the separate treatment of the station adjustment from that of the figure or net adjustment has been adhered to. After the conditions subsiRting between the measured directions at a station had been satisfied, these adjuste1l directions were simply introduced with equal weight in the net adjustment, the same as if they had been the direct result of observation. The method proposed by Bessel in 1838 of introducing the weight equations obtnined in eonuection with the station adjustment into the figure adjustment, a process which complicates the reduction very cousiderably, has been generally followed without modification; others have preferred the more simple and, in our opinion, the better method followed by us which appears also to have been favored by Gauss, of keepiug these processes separate. Our reasons for preferring the latter method (supplementing it, however, with the introduction of a special system of weigh ts), and apart from its recommendation of greater simplicity, ma:t;.be stated as follows: Iu the second operation or net adjustment new and distinct sources of error appear of a magnitude exceeding even the errors inherent in the first operation. It is almost the universal experience that the average corrections to the observed directions due to the net adjustment surpass in mag·nitude those due to the local adjustment, a fact which is explained by the presence of lateral refraction in the rays of light, the constant part of which deflection enten; into the geometrical conditious of the net, and the uariable part only becomei; apparent in the station conditions. Besides the disturbing influence oflateral refraction, errors having their origin in the effect of local deviations of the vertical, imperfect centring of the theodolite or in slight eccentricity of the heliotrope, in outstanding systematic graduation errors of the circles, and in other causes, tend to increa.se the corr~ctions 11eeded in the geometrical treatment of the trian;:ulation. To make these second corrections fully dependent on weights introduced from conditions only subsisting locally would seem to be of doubtful propriety; at any rate it would appear to be a sound principle to remove contradictions which had developed in observatious constituting a distinct operation, and which depend ou distinct sources of error, at once within the limits of that operation, and not to carry the conditions and weights into a second operation, which subjects the observed quantities to additional corrections, and which qualities depend on sources of error of a character and size different from those in the first operation. However correct the Besselian proceeding is from a theoretical point of view, there is, nevertheleMs, great danger tbat the results may be distorted by improper weights. .At :first, in Coast Survey practice, all directions iu the net-adjustment were given equal weight, but in 1864 greater precision was attempted by the introduction of distinct weights dept111ding mainly on the

accuracy of the local measures, but not ignoring the new conditions arising from their combination in triangles and other figures; in short, the weights to the directions were made to consist of two part.s, a variable one and a constant one, the latter to be furnished by means of the combination of triangles. Investigations of the laws of lateral refraction hitherto made are mostly confined to short lines, an<l a Yaluable contribution to our knowledge of the su~ject may be expectett from a discussion of our observations in connection with the great primary triangulation between California a11d Utah. ~~n interesting discussion on the "Influence of lateral refraction on horizontal angles" was lately (188~) published by Dr. A. Fischer.· His general results may be summp,fl up as follow.<;: The existence of lateral refraction as affecting the horizontal angular measures is proved directly and indirectly, the former by certain discrepancies in the observations, the latter by closing errors in the triangles or other figures; the influence of the distance of the observed object on the magnitude of the de\·iation i8 small; the higher the line of sight above the surface the smaller the lateral refraction may be expected to be. The principal factors determining the maguitude of the de,·iation are those depending on the condition of the atmosphere respecting distribution of density and temperature, both in a statical and in a dynamical sense. The lateral refraction appears to be subject to a daily ,·ariation, and he brings out the fact, from the triangulations of Englaud and of Prussia, that the short lines are more seriously affected than the long ones, in consequence of their generally closer proximity to the ground and the consequent denser atmosphere, and recommends the greate.~t triangles possible. Witp the largest triangles measurable there are the additional advantages of a smaller number of stations within a given area, and the greater accuracy with which the azimuth may be transferred from line to line. 8hould greater accuracy be demanded in the measures of horizonal direc tions than at present attained with our instruments, it may possibl~· be secured by a combinat1011 of da,y and night observations. This would eliminate the greater part of the p,ffect which persists as a constant deviation during the time of insolation, but which lateral refraction may be supposed to change sign during the tirue of nocturnal radiation.
DETERMINATION OF WEIGHTS TO DIRECTIONS IN THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE TRIANGULATION.

By tbe process adopted in 1864 we require to know the relative magnitude of the observing errors (at a station) and of the combination (to triangles and polygons) errors, respectivel_\·. To this end we need the closing errors of the triangles, and umisequeutl,r al8o a knowledge of the splierical excesses. For the computation of the length of sirl1-18 of triangles W(' emplo;v J,egendre's theorem, exteudcd, if required. It has been provetl that spheroidal triangles, as well as spherical triang·les, may be computed by means of this theorem without sensible error (Clarke's GeotleRy Chapter V). It will make no difference whether the sides of the spheroidal triangle be co11ceive1l as ellipti{~ arcs, as lines of alig·nment, or as geodetic Imes. 'I'he following expres8ion for the spherical excess e will iipply to the largest triangles yet measured:
£

ab sin U' [ 1 = 2---c---I'' 1 + .. 94----Y PP1 sm r (az + b2 + c2)

J

where p = radius of curYature of the meridian and Pi = radius of cunrature in the plane perpendicular to th·1 meridian at a point situated at the ceuter of the triangle. The sides a, 1>, care expresse,1 in metres and the value8 of log p and of log p 1 are tabulated in Appendix No. 18, CoMt· Snn:e~· J{eport for 1876. C' is the plane angle of the triangle between the side8 a and b. 'l'he value of tbe first term is talmlated for the argument rp(thelatitnde) in Appendix No. 7, Report for J,'i84. The seeoud term, involving the square of the sid1·s (an·I an average radius, r), sel!lom come.<; i11to U8e. Even in the largest triangle of the Survey, l\Iount Shasta, Mount Helena, r~ola, whose si1les are l:'IB, 167, a.ml 190 stlttntc miles, respectively, or 214, 269, and 306 kilometres (liea.rly), the term involving the squares of the sides is but 0.00022, aml when multiplie<l with the factor or first term, 14211.696, it becomes 0".031; and in all cases it suffices to distrilmtA1 the excess eq1wlfy over

the three angles.

The sides as here computed may advantageously be regarded as lines of alignment. These Jines have the property that for every point in the line the vertical plane at that point passes, when produced, through the terminal points, or, in other words, the azimuthal difference, at any point, of the initial and terminal points is 18()0. This line has, therefore, an advantage over the geodetic line, inasmuch as the first and last linear elements coincide in direction with the respective normal plane sections at the termiual points; hence the line of alignment enters directly into the measures of horizont.al directions, whereas the geodetic line deviates abruptly from the normal section, generally by one·third of the angle· contained between the two plane sections, one vertical at the first st.a· tion and p88Sing through the opposite one, the other vertical at the opposite st.ation and passing through the first.
Formula for the computation of geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuth& sufficiently precise for aides of the "largest triangles that may be directly measured.
In Appendix No. 7, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1884, are contained the formulre and tables ordinarily employed in the Survey for the computation of geographical positions a.nd their mutual azimuths. In the application of these formulre seven-place logarithms are used, and the results obtained possess all needful precision, provided the length of side or distance between two

points does not much exceed 10, or, roughly, 69 statute miles or 111 kilometres, and the forrnulre may even be used up to 100 statute miles when moderate accuracy suffices. The primary triangulations of California, Nevada, and Utah are on so large a scale that a stricter expression for the numerical computation is demanded. Among the different solutions of the problem we prefer the one given by Lieutenant-Colonel Clarke,· which was employed in the computation of the larger triangles of the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain, and 1tlso in the computation of the verification and extension of the arc of the meridian at the Cape of Good Hope. The method is found convenient even without specially prepared tables, such as accompany the Coast and Geodetic Survey formulre, two of which tables, however, could be utilized if extended to 8 or 9 places of decimals; this number of decimals is demanded by the extended formulre for the numerical logarithmic work. The surface of development is the spheroid, the dimensions of which were published by Ohuke in 1866, and which was found to be more nearly conformable to the earth's figure (and to the surface of the United States in particular) than the Besselian spheroid previously employed. Let cp, il be the latitude and longitude of the given point, a the azimuth and s the distance to the second point, then the latitude cp', the longitude "A' and the reverse azimuth a' may be computed by the following formulre:

The distance s is the length of either of the elliptic arcs from the first to the second, or from the second to the first point, and differs only infinitesimally from a line of alignme1it and from a geodetic line between the same points. r is the normal, extended to the minor axis, for the girnn point or latitude, or

For the longest line in the Yolo base-figure, Mount Helena to Mount Diablo, the difference in the results by the two methods, and when 8 place logarithms are employed in the computation is just appreciable, viz, in latitude 0".001, in longitude 0".003, and in azimuth 0''.002 There remains the computation of the geographical position of each point; for this purpose we need a standard geodetic latitude <p0 , a standard georletic azimuth «o, and the introduction of the telegraphic longitude l, there being but one station.
Determination of standard geodetic data for tke computation of geogmphical positiom.

For the expression of the curvature between the sea level and the altitude of the station we have (see Clarke's Geodesy, pp. 101-102)

GEODETIC RECONNAISSANCE.

By CHARLES O. BOUTELLE, Assistant.

The a-0companying memoir on Reconnaissance is intended to supply such information as my long experience suggests on a subject uot fully treated in any text-book on Geodetic Surveying which has come under my notice. It is not inteuded to supersede any portiou of Appendix No. 9, Report of 1882, on the field work of the triangulation, hut rather to enlarge and illustrate that portion of it which treats of Reconnaissmwe, h.r examplPs rlra.wn from actual casPs occurring in the usual routine, and by bringing out very full.\· the principles, theoretical and practical, wllich should govern in carrying on this ver,y difficult, responsible, and laboriouoi i)Qrtion of Coast and Geodetic Survey duty. No depart· ment of professional labor calls for the exercisfl of a higher order of ability, or better repays thorough execution.
REOONNAISSANCE.-PRIMARY TRIANGULATION AND BASE LINES.

Primary triangulation over any extended geographical area should be so laid out and conducted that its results should approach as near to absolute precision as the present condition of scientific research, tlleoretical, instrumental, and practical, will permit. No refinement in observation or reduction should be omitted which it is possible to supply. It should start from a Base so selected as to ground as to present the fewest natural obstacles to the passage of apparaturs of the most delicate nature over l\Ver.Y part of it. The length of this base should not be less than from eight to twelve kilometers, while its direction and terruinals should be so 8elected as to admit of the formation upon it of triangles of gradually increasing sides, as the configuration· of the surrounding country may admit.
OF BASE LINES.

The terminals of a base line need not of necessity be intervisible from the ground, provided they can be rendered so from elevations of twelve to twenty meters. At no one of the primary bases of the Coast Survey at Bodie's Island, North Uarolina, at Edist-0 Island, South Carolina, at Epping, Me., or at the Atlanta Base, were the termini intervisible from the ground. While the nearest approach to a level plain iis decidedly the most favorable for a baie line, it is not an essential. In the earlier bases measuretl in tlrn Southern States near the ocean, small grades were always to be bad, and the number of level plaues largely predominated; but at the Epping Base, in Maine, measured i_n 1857, gradients of 1 in 20, or of an angular value of 30, were adopted with entire success. In 18n, when prolonged search in the viciuity of Atlanta, Ga., developed only greatly undulating surfaces, a base·line was finall.r selected, with gradients as large as 50, or 1 in 11.5. This base, which was 9.3 kilograms in lengtl1, was divided into no less than 270 difforent planes, ranging in their slopes from level to 5°. It was measured three times, and the a11paratus upon the second measure was carried in the opposite direction to that of the first and third, so that ascending slopes upon the first were descending slopes upon the second, yet the accord of the two measures was so nearly perfect as to demonstrate that the apparatus could be well an<l. safely used upon so diversified a surface. With the new primary-base apparatus, used at the Yolo Base, in Oalifornia, the maximum grade was slightly greater, or 50 21'. At this base, also, two measurements were made in opposite directions, with the same result.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY.

In both these bases small sharp hollows were crossed upon trestle-work, which in former bases had been considered inadmissible. Embankments of crib-work were also used to advantage at Epping in 1857 and at the Atlanta Base in 1873. These points will be useful in searching for future base lines, and will enable the observer to pay greater attention to the base connections, both in respect to geometric conditions and to gradual development. Examples of the best forms of such connections may be seen upon sketch No. 3, accompanying the Coast and Geodetic Sm·\·ey Annual lfoport for 1884. The first primary base of the surYey was measured by )lr. Hassler in 1,"34, near the sea-beach of Fire Island. It was liable to be destroyed by the encroachment of the sea upon the land, and it was ingeniously transferred from the ''Measured Base" to the Interior 01· " ~fountain Base" upon Long Island, extending from ''West Hilb" to "Ruland" by a quadrilateral of good proportions, whence another quadrilateral, with graduall.Y increasing sides, carries the system across Long Island Sound to anotber longer side from '' ·w ooster" to Sandford, and f'urnislrns bases for extending the reticulation in both directions along tbe coast and also into tl!e interior. Anotller example of base connection, ha\·ing e,·ery element of geometrical precision which could be asked for, may be seen upon tl!e same sketch, at the Epping Base, in Maine, where the terminals connect with the three subsidiary stations, ''Burke," "Pigeon,'' and '' Tuuk," and gradually enlarge the Rides to the dimensions of the primary triangulation. Still another example of gradual expausio11, through quadrilaterals, may be seen upon sketch.No. 11, l~eport for 1884, where tue measurNl "Yolo Base" is carried iu two quadrilaterals of good slmpe from tile plain to the mountain summits.
RECONNAISSANCE FOR STATIONS OF A PRIMARY TRIANGULATION.

With bases measured and the base-connection established, the next step is a reconnaissance for the extension of the primary triangulation by the selection of the most suitable points in the proposed system of triangles. Certain general principles must of necessity govern this work, which is one requiring the exer· cise of skill and good judgment combined with readiness in the application of geometric principles in the most varied forms of practical application to surveys over large areas. These priuciples are(J) Primary trfaugulation should be carried on with the fewest possible number of stations which the configuration of the country wtll allow, and at the same time preserve the highest order of precision. This is best attainable by a system of quadrilaterals with every point intervisible; and next by a s_ystem of hexagons or pentagons where each exterior point sees a central interior station but does not necessarily see every other exterior point. (2) Primary stations should occup.> crests of ridges, or the highest accessible summits of mountain ranges. This is especially nece1-1sary in the United States, whose population and resources are so rapidly increasing. ~.\.!though the particular object of the work in hand may be simply to connect certain points more or less distant by a geodetic chain, yet in a few years that very chain may of necessity be enlarged in every direction to meet demands for more precise interior surveys. If the highest summits are cltol'len at first, even at greater first cost of time, labor, and money, theu when the time arrives (as it surely will) for extending sm·veys in new directions the old bases will be the best possible under all circumstances. The writer desires to especially impress this point upon future obsen·ers, who will be tempted, as he has l>een (and too often yielded), into selection of some point, not a crest but near one, convenient of access, cleared of forest timber, aml filling every condition needed for the work immediately in hand. I cite one case to show bow this bas cost largely in the end. In 1845 a primary triangulation was laid out to connect Washington with the Kent Island base, near Annapolis. A point, " Soper" (see sketch 4, Coast Survey He port of 1874), was chosen because it involved lines of least cutting for connection with stations in and near the capital city, and could be occup~ed, at small cost, without elevation of the 30-inch theodolite which was used at the station. In 1868 the attempt to carry a chain of primary triangles through the fiat and densely wooded

country close upon the seaboard, south of the Chesapeake, was abandoned, and it was decided to continue th1· chain which then extended from New Bruu1'wick to Yirg·inia, along the first rauge of hills parallel to the sea-coast, which was the origin. of the "Blue lfolge triang·nlation." It wa8 attemptefl to use the work already execnte1l npo11 Washington and a.hove referred to; hut careful reconnaissance developed tlle fact that the station Soper conl<l uot lie made to look we,;terly, wllile only 3 miles nortliwest of it was a ridge 11Parly 100 feet higher, which commanded the entire conn. try in every direction, and was the crest lierween the Chesapeake and Potomac. To remedy the mistake of 1845 iu the later work cost the Coast Survey several thousand dollars. This is one of many such cases. (~{) In tlie older works upou geodesy ::mo is prescribed as the smallest admissible angle in a primary cbaiu. But since the datt> of most of tlwse works the degree of attaiuable precision in the observations of directiom; 11as been largl'ly i11creased, until the probable errnr of an oliserved 1lirec· tion in primar;v triangulation now rarel,v exceeds 0".2, an<l a change of 0".5 in each angle of a triangle so badly shaped tl1at one angle should be 12.'>0 and tlw other (opposite the Lase) ouly 150 would cause a change i11 the resulti11g Ri<leR of om.07 for each 10 kilonwters of lengtli, and this difference wonld be large]~· reduced in the adjustment of au~- ,,~·stem of quadrilaterals of which such a triangle would form a part. V.'hilP, tben·fore, thP greatei\t earn should he taken to obtain only "well-conditioned" triangles, yet the only cac;e wl1t>rP the rule of nothing le8s that 3()0 should he rigidly adhered to is the case of a siugle chain a<lmittiug of 110 check betwt>en measuretl basf's. (4) An es.~eutial point in reconnaissm1m> i,;; tlie detPrmination hl·~·ond the possibility of tlouht of the inten·isibilit~· of e,\'er;y pr1mar;\· linP PSsPntial to the Rcheme. This is often a \'eQ· difficult and douhtfol mattn whPre the lines of sig-lit are from GO to l'.?O kilometNS in length, and the weather is thick arnl haz,L Patimit waiting for a hsolntP certainty, howeYer a11noyiug or Yexatious, or whatever hardship it may entail, is better than to allow an;v 1loubt to cloud r<'ported res.nits aud perhaps cause serious delay and loss of time, which is money, to the obserw·rs who will succeed the reconnoitering party. (5) Permanence of position for primary statious is an ol~ject to be carefully looked to, P~pecially near the sea-coast where inroads of the ocean are possible, or in places where excaYatious may be marle or huilclings erected. Jn atlditiou to the mmal umlerground and surface marks, a round of angles upon prominent near o~jects, natural and artifi<'ial, will often serYe to rec1wer and identify a long disused station. Not many years ago the writer hail occasion to reco,·er a primary station upon tlie i8la11d of Nantucket, originally made a quarkr of a century before, by an agsif~tant man~· years dt·ceased. He was conducted by two residents of the island to the "exact site'' of the former flignal. He bad with him the original description, accompanied with angles upon certain chnrcheR and light· houses, of which four, he was informed, were the same he now beheld. Ou setting up his instrument and obsen·ing the angles he at once saw and said to the venerable men who had accom. panied him that their memoril:'s were at fault. That waR not the hill on which the station bad been made. They scouted the idea of a mistake on their part, and were indignant that a Rtranger 8honld be better informed than they who had spent their lives near the place. Pa~·iug no furtlwr attention to them, the instrument was removed to another ri<lge nbont a third of a mile distant. \\here, after half an hour of tentative observation, he directed his men to dig for the underground 111ark placed there 25 years ago, which they quickly discm·ered within 3 feet of the place he had iud1ca,ted, to the unconcealed astonishment. and mortification of his well-meaning hut mistaken informants. This incident emphasizes the fact that the recorded description of the :,;tation, witltout the ob.~erred angle.~, would not have sufficed to recover the station, since the external aspect of the two hills was ,-ery much alike. Assuming that geodetic surveys will, sooner or later, be extt>nded over eYery part of the vast territory of the United States, it is of the highest importance that each triangulation point shall be so marked, and the record of the marking made so. clear and definite, that the exact gite may be recoverable during succeeding centuries. Topo11;rapbical features may change witl1 adnmciug population and wealth. New maps will he wanted. They may he quickly and read1J~· supplied if only the old trigonometrical stations, or a part of them, may be reproduced. At thi,; moment a new topographical survey of the State of Massachusetts is in progress. No new great triangulation

is necessary, for enough of the triangulation of 1832 to 1840 is found to furnish bases for supplying the new secondary and tertiary points required. For a more detailed descrijltion of methods of marking stations, see .Appendix No. 9, Heport for 188:.!, ''Field work of tlie Trianf?·ulation," pages 159 and 160. Thus the officer making the recomrnisRauce for a triangulation should bear in mind, in selecting and making his stations, th<1t bis work is not for an immediate present purpose only, but that it may furnish bases for future centuries. Primary triangulation presents difft·reut phases and encounters widt>ly yaried difficulties, depending upon the character of the country it traverse8. Of these are1. Triangulation across bays and lakes, like DelawlJ,re or Chesapeake Bays. 2. Over open country, nearl.r le\·eJ, as upon prairies. 3. U\·er a comparatively level farming country, partially woo1led. 4. Over a hilly and wooded country, with parallel ridges of nearly the same ekvation. 5. Over a hilly or mountain conn try, with elenttions of irregular beiglit. Taking these up in the orrl<>r named, the first bring1; up at once tht· limitatiom; of lengths of 8ides, depending on the eleYations to he found on each sidA of the bay or lakP. HPrP it is important to consider a point esse11tial to precision of.observation. It is that no primary li1ie, across water, or over a le,·el country, should approach nearer thau ten feet to tlH; 1'nrfacp of the point where the line of sight become8 tangent to the cu1Te ot the earth's surface. It i" apt to encounter a disturbed stratum of air very likely to deflect it lateraliy as well as vertimtll,\-, as also veQ' difficult to see through. vVhere the elevatious of the two stations abo,·e the water behreen them, and t.l1eir dil"· tance from each other, are approximately known, the question of their interd1;ibilitv ma;v- be quickly soh·ed b~· an application of the following rule, which is easy to renwmher: It assumes a coefficient of refraction= 0.07. The curYature (and refraction combined) in feet is th'e lnmdrt>·l and seventy-four tho11sa11dths of the square of the distance in statute mil1's, or U/ = 0.57 4 D 111 2 , and recip· rocally D m =

~~~{4 :

To apply this in practice, the distance from Egg Shoal to Long Shoal Poi"llt,

near Cape Hatteras (Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1884, Sketch No. 5), i8 22.3 miles. Both stations are 12 feet ahoye Pamplico Sound. 'Vhat eleYation will be reqnired at each end to carry the line of sight 12 feet ahoYe the surface of the water T As the heights of the two stations are equal the line of sight will be tangent to the earth's curve at the midway point, or 11.15 miles from each end. The height required will tl1erefore = 0.574 x 11.152 = 71.4 feet. Ii now the signal at Egg Shoal be raised to a height of !lO fei>t ahove the ground, where will the line of sight become tangent to the curve, aIHl what elevation will be required at Long Shoal Point Y

/_~[~ = 12.52 miles from Egg Shoal, or 22.30 -12.52 = 9.78 miles '\j0.514 from Long Shoal Point, where the height requirerl will be 0.574 x !).782 = 54.9 fert. Therefore, a telescope 55 feet above the ground at either station will be sure to see a Rigual !lO feet above the ground at the other station, and the liue of sight will he sure to pass at least 12 feet above the surface of the Round at the tange11t point. I give now an example of a difforent nature. In making the reconnaissance for extension of the primarJ· triangulation across MaRsaclrnsetts, it became important to make a station 11pon Uape Ann which should see Manomet Hill in Plsmouth across l\lassachusetts llay. A triangulation point of the l\~assachusetts State Sun·ey, called Railcut Hill, had beeu found in that survey to be 205 feet above the sea, while Manomet Hill was 304 feet high. The distance between the two was 48.5 miles. Were they intervisible, or could they be easily be made so Y By the foregoing formula the "portee" or distance from Manomet to the tangent point was

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

In an opP11 levp] country, where no natural or artificial ohstacleR interfere, the triangulation may h(· lai1l out with reference onl:r to the ln·igl1ts of 1<tructure8 erected and the gPometrical conditiou1< iun>h-ed. If a uHil'orru lleig:l1t above gTotmd of 70 fppt be assumed for the iustrurnent and signal, a11d the line of sight is rnadt> to pass 10 feet alHffe the surface at the tangent-point, a single serit's of 1warly l'l}Hilateral triauglcs \Yi th Ride8 about !!O miles in length ma,Y he made. This would he the !lest ,.;~·stem to a<lopt iu a lt>n·l woodNl country wl1ere avenues are required on every line, as i11 a dmin of triangles across th!:' Florida Pc11insula, where the triaugulation starts from a base 011 tlie Atlantic Ri<le, to meet and be clieeked b,v anotlwr baRe upon the Gulf Bide. But iu a level and open ('otmt1·.v a syRtl'm of rprndril.ttt·ral:s with i:;ides of about l;i miles a11d diagouals of 21 will 011ly requin' one 111on· station for e,·cry 30 milei,; of progrei,;s, and will more than gain this expense and labor in tlte ad1litio11al precision acquirerl. In a level cotmtr.r which is cnlfrrnte1l and wher!:' woo<l land is \'aluable, very careful reconm1issa11ce is 11ece:,;sary to an>i<1 Rtrikin!!' insuperable ol>stacle8, as houses a111l ornamental trees. If thP eountry is int!:'rsccte<l fi>· 11avip:able creeks, as upon the sea islands of South Carolina anu Georgia, chains of seeornlary tria11gles along the water courses have proved tlie best resource. About ten yPan: ago I plarnw1l a mPthod of connecting the Atlanta and Edisto Ba:ses, hy extern!· i11g a chain of trim1gles from 11ear "Cnrraliee" Station. iu North Georgia, along the \'alley of the Sanumah Hin;r, with stations upon the hills 011 eaeli side a;,; far as Augusta, where the "rolling country" PIHb, a111l tl1enc!:' hy measureuwut upou the Augusta aIH1 Port R.oyal railroad, a distance of 80 miles, lo a co111H'Ctio11 with the eoast triaugulatim1 at Beaufort, S. U. This method of measurement was proposed hy Assist:rnt .T. E. Hilganl in Appendix No. !J, Report for 1867. I Lave alway.~ co11side1·e<l it practieahlt· upon railroaus liaviug- oul,1 a slight iiercentage of curvature, where the dirl'ction may ht' carefully kept up hy a11gnl:u measurements and obsen·ed azimuths. The railroad h('l"l' narne<l l1as one straight liuc of Mi miles in length, wldch is half the whole distance to ue measured. lll a hilly and woodecl country, with parallel ridges of nearly the same eleYation, Uie skill and rer,;onrcPs of the rl'connoitcring ofiicN are Sl'H'rely tried. A Hecondary triaugulation may he easily lai<l out, since the sides may he carried from ridge to l'idge across the intervening valle.rs. But tile, longer sides required for prinrnry triangles must cross these wooded ridges ai various angles, awl to ascPrtaln with certainty the il1tervisibilii,\· of distant points or tlw possibility of rendering them int!·ryi:;dble is often exceedi11gJ,,- diflicult. The best method is that of au apJ>roximate seconclar.r triangulation with a gradienter or (if oh1:wn·atio11N mu;;t lw rnn<le from tops of tr!:'es) \Yith a sextaut, starting, of courst', from some known base. A computation of approximate trianglf' sideH, cornuiue!l hy liuear co.ordinate;; from the meridian of tlie i,;tartiug point aml kept up a8 tile reconnaissance prog-resRes, will best den,lop hot h t lw po1's1 ble tria nglt's and the geonwtrieal Hg urn bt·Ht suited to the gronnu. Approximate yertil-al a11gles will giYe dift'pr(~llc!:'s of le\-el close e11ongh to decide on ele\'ations Iikels to be needed to Ne!' oYer i11t('J'H'J1i11g ridges, and ali,;o to ascertain wliich are the highest crests of each ridge. Proceeding with care in this rnauner, it will be fouud that certain points.are so situated, both in position, eleYatiou, au<l accessibility, that tl1ey must be primar.v stations. Others again prnsent equal advalltageH, and may be clwse11, that is, Borne one of them may be, while others, which had appeared at the outset as ,·ery prominent from their abrupt alld sharp ele\'ation abm·e the general ]eYel, falk into insignificauce before loug and gradual slopes, which finally overtop all others. Keepiug iu mi11d the priuciple heretofore set forth, that." primary station8 should occupy the higilest crests,'' aud pati{·ntly laboring to disco,·er and identify wl1at are the highest crests, it will be found, when tLese are cliseon>.retl and counected hr approximate linear co-ordinates, that they am snseeptible of such linear counections as will, at least cost of time and money, develop iuto the best ohtaiuaule H~·stem of primary triangulation. Hence follow two rules for recounaissance in such a difficult conn try as 1 am describing, viz: First, search for tile crests or highest points of the highest ridg('S aud connect them hy an a1>proximate series of small triangles from a known base. Seeon<l, endeavor to render the sdected points intervisil1le bJ avenues across wooded intervening ridges, or by building high enough to see over them, or both combined.

height will, as a rule, admit of the fewest po8sible number of stations with the longest possible sides, as in the great "Davidson" quadrilateral in Oalifornia, where one diagonal is 143 miles long and the area of the quadrilateral is over 61600 square miles. These great distances are not attainable east of the Rocky Mountains, as neither topographic nor atmospheric conditions admit of them; but the principle of the choice of the highest summits with the fewest possible number of stations bas been carried out in the primary triangulation along the coast from Narragansett Bay to the Bay of Fundy, a distance of about 400 miles, covered by 9 quadrilaterals, or about 45 miles to each quadrilateral. The conditions governing the choice of stations in the chain of triangles connecting the Kent Island and Atlanta Bases were of an entirely different character. The very level and densely wooded character of the sea-coast son th of Chesapeake Bay forced the great chain of primary triangulation back to the first range of hills parallel to the coast, which was the Blue Ridge, and the plan adopted wat1 to make the back tier of stations upon the Blue Ridge and the front tier nearest the coast upon the outlying foot-hille as far southeasterly as intervisible stations could oo found. From these conne!ting chains of smaller triangles were to be made with the sea-coast bases at Bodies', Edisto, and Dauphin Islands. As a matter of necessity nearly every quadrilateral here took an elongated form, with the longer sides along the mountain ranges and parallel to the seaboard. Omitting the smaller eeriee required to reach the mountaine from Annapolis, the distance of 602 miles between the two bases is covered by 16 q11adrilaterall4, having an average length of about 38 miles from each long side an\l 25 miles for the short side of ea.ch quadrilateral, with the longest side 82 miles and the shortest side 20 miles. In this form of rooonnaisi;ance, as in that preceding it, the tiret step to he taken i11 a general e:xamina.tion of the country, fixing its most prominent features in the mind of tbe observer, most careful watch being kept of the different phases presen~d by the principal elevations as seen from different points of view. Here rapid outline sketches inserted in the note-book will be found of great service in identifying t.he same point under.different rJ.Spects. This general reconnaissance also helps in acquiring a habit of self-orientation, by which, on reaching a mountain summiti with an extended ooup d'aJil, the eye will at once recognize and correctly locate the most. salient points of view. This is followed by a close reconnahisance, with tile advantage that certain points ot' special prominence have been reeognized as belonging to the class of station8 that must be taken, thus reducing the work t-0 an examination of those which may be taken. As these must of necessity bear certain geometric relations to the "must-be" stations, the general region to be more carefull.v looked to is narrowed, and the work to be done more sharply defined. The best method is that described on the preceding page. Start from a known base, and make an irregular approximate triangulation; that is, wherever a cleared hill presents itself which is accessible visit it and observe angles upon all prominent objects in sight. If no known station is visible, observe the magnetic meridian as a reference point. The best instrument for the purpose is the gradienter, which is light, small, and compendious, enabling one to get very good a1>proximate elevations with its micrometer. Early in the work some of the points seen and observed from the known stations will be observed, and it will be possible to compute the positions of one or more of the points visited.
TJm:U:·POINT PROBL:Elll.

If only the positions may be known to within 150 meters, it will be sufficient to insure their presence:within the field of view of the t.elescope if they are in sight. The "three-point" problem may be used to advantage if as many u three or more known points are approximately observed. Where the known positions are projected on a reconnoitering map, the position of the point of observation may be approximately ascertained by plotting the observed angle upon tracing muslin and fitting the three or more diverging lines to-hit the observed station, as usual in hydrographic work, with the three-arm protractor. But where the position of the point is wanted in proloogin1 thA reoonnai888oce, it may be aomp11ted. AP. eumple is here ~ven.

For reconnaissance in a wooded country, where obserYatio11~ must be from tree tops, a small 6-iuch sextaut, with telescolJe ttttachetl, of the form rnm most m;e<l iu hydrograpl:Jy, will be better than the usual pocket sexttrnt.

In this memoir I have avoided theoretical discussions and only set forth practical details. For full discussion of the geometrical and mathematical principles involved, I refer to Assistant Schott's Appendix 20, Report of 1876, on the "Adaptation of Triangulation to the various conditions of configuration and character of the surface of the country, and other causes." Also to ''Clarke's Goodesy," vol. 1, 8vo., Oxford, 1880; and to" Jordan's Geodesy," vol. 2, 8vo., Stutt~art, 1877; and "Principal Geodetic Points, and their Co-ordinates," vol. 1, 8vo., Berlin. The two lastnamed works are in German. In conclusion, the writer desires to say that be has embodied tn this paper an experience of over forty years, covering every department of Coast and Geodetic work. If he has succeeded in bringing together information useful to his comradell and liUCCelilsors, be will have aecomplished the end sought for and will be amply repaid. C. 0. BOUTELLE, Assistant.

A PLEA POR A LIGHT ON SAINT GEORGE'S BANK.
By HFJNRY MI'l'CHELL, Assistant,

To our late Superiuteudent, I'rof. J. E. Hilganl, a.s a member of tbe Light-House Board, I made a communication some mo11th>1 since concerning the necei;i;ity of lighti; upou the summit of Saint George's Bank. Perhaps in all m.Y expp1·ie11ce as a coast snrn·:rnr I have never felt that I was doing more Christian service than wheu compiling tilt' notes that I hpg· leavP to repeat below. Although the position of Cape Sable was accurately d«termilled iu 1755, the' whereabouts of the George's was still a myster,r at the beginning of this century. Dr. Franklin had declared it111 latitude, a.nd his conclusion was correct, lmt he di<l uot Yentnre to mentio11 it>1 longitude, and the charts that adopted his latitude put the shoals 3i) milt>;.; out in lougiturle. Oue ha;.; hnt to glance at the chart to guess how much mischief such a11 error of positiou rnust hase caused. The charts of that time did not agree, happily, so that tbe navigator did not t.rnst. them, a;; he now does, implicitly. But as the charts impron, the day and night marks of slloal8 beeome not less but more essential. The na,·igator hai; now a (·hart. t11at lw knows is corre<Jt, aml trn lays down his course with the slightest possible <leflectiou from a straight line, an·I as he shavei,; the dangerous reef or shoal he expect.'! to find a warning mark, for there is time and property and life to be saved, and the whole community shares the risk and the danger. Should it, not be a surprise then to us that the greatest danger on our coast, and the one feared by the largest number, perhaps, of seamen, is unmarked and undistinguishable except h.Y it8 hideous roar whrn the ship is already within its breakers' Saint George's Bank lies at the threshold of the Gulf of Maine, and its summit is called distinctively "George's Shoal," or "The Georges." Twenty miles westwaro of the Georges is the "Cultivator Shoal." Upon the Georges there are two spots of 12 feet given by chart, while upon Cultivator Shoal there is not less than 18 feet. (See Annual Report Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1879, Appendix No. 10, for physical con<litions.) If we draw a line from the Nantucket South Shoal light-ship to Brazil Rock, off Cape Sable, we find Cultivator Shoal 12 nautical miles outside (seaward) of this line, and the 12-foot. limit of the George's 22 miles outside of the same line. These shoals then are outside of the Gulf of Maine and beyond the general trend of the coast. Again, if we draw a line from Hatteras to Uape Sable, which passes 150 miles seaward of Sandy Hook (at the apex of the great bay, of which our line is the chord), we still find George's Shoa.1 a salient protruding into the ocean. It is 100 miles from the nearest land, Chatham, Cape Cod. Its situation relative to the continent is like that of Sable Island, and, like this island, it would long· ago have been lighted if dry land. As a shoal it is far more dangerous tbau it would he as au island, and therefore it is shunned and feared except by fishermen who are obliged to brave its dangers. lf we dra.w a line from Nantucket light-ship to Cape Race (Newfoundland), it passes about 6f miles out.side (southward) of the Cultivator Shoal, hut 1t passes dire,ctly over George's Shoal between the 18 and 24 foot contours, where the lightest draught vessel can rarely pass in safety because of breakers. Thus we see that George's Shoal, an untn<vrked danger, lies in the skorU8t water route between New York and Liverpool (and other ports of Northern Europe), and the fear of it

makes voyages longer and more anxious. But for this, vessels that now go wide out to sea, making a great detour, would run coastwise within Sable Island, which is well lighted. As it iis, unless Halifax or some other port of Nova Scotia is to be visited, vessels run far southward. Still, even under present conditions, vessels from Europe haul in to make Nantucket light-ship, and if they do so f'lkilfully they pass within 10 miles of the 12-foot spot on George's Shoal. A line from Nantucket light-ship to Sable Island eastern light passes 10 or 11 miles outside of i.:be Cultivator Sboal and 4 or 5 miles outside of George's. Now, parallel to this line at a safe· sighting distance from Nantucket Shoals and Sable Island lights, a ship's course would still be only 10 miles off George's-near e'M'ILf}h to ~ee an MdVltary light-ship, if our Government could not afford a more generous spark. It is not alone the direct danger from this lion in the path that we would present as a reason for a warning light, but the advantage also of the light itself as a guide. With this warning and guiding light the European commerce of New York would gain time and reduce its risks; and in less measure, but still to an important degree, the ocean commerce of Boston, Sa1em, Newbury. port, Portsmouth, Portland, Bath, Bangor, Saint John, &e., would be benefited. In our remarks, thus far, we have not considered the fishing fieet. One easily sees that the shortening of time, however slight, and the diminution of risks however small, as affecting the grand ocean commerce, must command att;ention. But it is not so obvious that small fishing vessels that seek these shallow waters can receive benefits from a local light to any extent deserving consideration, especially as their fishing ground covers 500 square miles of "George's Bank." It must be remembered, however, that the fishing fleet of the Gulf of Maine numbers over 600 sea-going vessels of 30 to 300 tons ea<ih, with average, perhaps, 70 tons. Of these there may be at times 400 fishing on the George's or crossing the shoals en rout,e to more distant grounds. These 400 vessels carry about 4,000 men, all working on shares, and presenting the most just and most useful form of co-operative industry that our country offers. The vessels seeking Provincetown Harbor, the nearest good shelter, sometimes number 500 by ftCtnal count. We may conceive of the Georges fleet (of 100 vessels perhaps) as gathering in t.owards the summit of the Bank, as near as would be safe, without very definite boundaries or uniform distribution of vessels. The light that we propose, and the powerful horn placed at the nucleus of this fleet, would reach a very considerable part of the vessels and serve to maintain their reckoning. In the present state of things not only do skippers form a very indefinite idea of the whereabouts of the shoals when fresh from port, but after a few days' cruising they not unfreqnently lose their reckoning altogether. We submit that the sight of a light on George's SboaJ, or the sound of a horn from that much dreaded spot, would enable many a fishing vessel to stand away for port, when the storm threatens, instead of attempting to ride out the gale a;t anchor or lie-to with fear of dragging upon the shoal or fouling with another of the fleet. ''Though none of our fisheries are exempt from peril, it may safely be said that the winter ood fisheries on George's Bank and the trawl fishery, especially that for haddock and halibut in wint.er, are the most dangerous of all." These words we quote from the "Fisherman's Own Book," and from this book, and other sources, we learn that in 1879 Gloucester alone lost 13 vessels and 143 lives; in 1882, 4 vessels with 51 lives, and in 1883-'84 18 vessels and about 180 lives. I give the figures for a few years only and only for the Gloucester fleet, which covers but tw0-thi:ms of the interest of fisheries on the Georges, perhaps. It is impossible to say what proportion of tbeae vessels might have run int.o port, ha.d they known their exact whereabouts, or bow many times, for fear of being caught thus in a. dangerous neighborhood, the fleet has unnecessarily left the fishing ground. One need not spooalate upon the economical relations of the case, the srory is bad enough as it stands! Here we have a breaking shoal lying exactly on the shortest route from New York t;o the British Channel, and near the routes of a.U the ocean commerce of Massachusetts Bay and the Bay of l<'undy, with no warning light! Moreover, it is the resort of a great fleet of winter fishing vessels that lose their reckoning, a.nd thus their ehance of making a safe harbor in the gale, because no signal upon the shoal gives them tlie correct bea.rinp ud distances of the numerou port.s which

They often do not know which direction from them the summit of the shoal lief\

and are afraid to move from the position which thick weather and darkness finds them in.

Mr. C. H. Farley, chairman of the harbor commission of Portland (writing nnofficially, it. should be said), mentions that "the Dart was the largest privateer of the war of 1812. She sailed from this port and was lost on George's. The brother of the captain was a prominent merchant of Portland, and ever after that disaster, as long as he lived, advocated tht' building of a monument on that shoal. The bones of all who have perished them would make a monument higher than that on Bunker Hill; and the property Jost would pay for one of Ailvee, if not too high." :My proposition, less equivocal than that of the printeersman's brother, is, that to our brotherR, the fishermen and peaceful traders who have died for us on George's Shoal, l<>t UR rai>ie a monument in the form of a light-house and fornish it with it fog-horn to utter one perpetual wail.

COMPARISON 01'' TRANSVERSE SECTIONS Th THE DELAWARE RIVER, BETWEEN OLD NAVY-YARD AND EAST END OF PETTY'S ISLAND, FOR THE YEARS 1819, 1843, AND 1878.
By HENRY L. MARINDIN, Assistant.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

Boston, Mass., Marek 30 1 1885. DEAR SIR: I have prepared and desire to submit herewith a report on Transverse Sections in the Delaware River, between Old Na'\""y- Yard and East End of Petty's Island, compared for the years 1819, 1843, and 1878. The following comparison of the changes in the transverse section of this part of the Delaware River was undertaken because it embraces the principal part of tbe harbor of Philadelphia, and although comparisons have been made before by giving the shift of the river bed by volumes, no showing bas been made by means of profile of cross-section. The importance of this part of tl1e river may be inferred from the fact that it co>ers both of tbe Windmill Island chanuels, also Smith's Island Bar, and both of the channeh1 around Pt>,tts's Island. The selection of tl1e trarnsverse sections was determined by the position of the sounding lines of the surve:y made by McClure in 1819. These sounding lines were run, in most eases, so as to give a fair cross-8ection of the stream, although not at equal distances apart. The changes are represented on the accompanying six plates, which explain themselves in a great measure. Some Qf the notable chauges I will call your attention to briefly. From Section 1, off Old Navy-Yard, to the present southern extremity of Windmill Island, the cross-sections reaffirm the discovery, in a preceding comparison of depths, of the increase of depth on the shoal ground south of Windmill Island. The wharf line indicates a general advance into the stream, with a corresponding deepening in the channel and an easterly movement of the westerly slope of the shoal, with an exception at Section 3, where this slope has remained stationary for the three epochs. Here at Section 3, off Pier 36, it would seem that the compensation for the advance of the wharf line was obtained wbo11y by t,be disappearance of the apron shown as exist. ing in 1819 on the city front (see Section 3). Another feature of this cross-section is the disappearance of the dry-ground end of Windmill Island, already alluded to in another report. From cl'Qss-section 4 to 9 we have the comparison of both of the Windmill Island channels. We may continue to notice the advance of the wharf-line, more marked however, between the years 1843 and 1878. This advance has in most cases been followed by an increase of channel depth, which is an improvement only where the depth is insufficient; but here-the depth exceeds the wants of commerce, so that a questionable improvement was obtained at the expense of width of water-way where navigable room was already restricted. The depth along the island front has remained without change. In the ·eastern channel the marked advance of the Jersey shore, by its occupation by wharves, bss also been followed by increase of channel depth. From Section 9 to 12 we have cross-sections over Smith's Island Bar. The advance of the wharves on the Philadelphia front is still maintained. A great importance attaches to this part of ib.e harbor from the fa.et brought out by the resurvey ma.de by the United States Engineer Depart4&7

ment, under Oolouel Ludlow, in 1882, that the bar was shifting towards the Philadelphia shore at While this is troe of _the crest of the bar off the foot of Callowhill street (shown in cross-section 12), which was, I believe, the point indicated by the resnn·e~-, the examination of cross-sections 11, 10, and 9 would indicate the opposite tendency, tbatof a retreat of the western slope of the Bar towards the Jersey shore. The width. of channel-way between the Bar and the Philadelphia Rhore remains the same, as the shift of the Bar was either followed or preceded by the advance of the wharves in the same direction. At Section 9, off tile foot of Market street, and at Section 10, off the foot of Arch street, the increase of channel depth following the advance of the wharf line is not so decided as was the case along the froutage south of Mark et street; the easterly shift of the western slope of the Smith's Island Bar is probably the effect of tbe advance of the wharf line along the city front. The inference to be drawn from the inspection of the changes shown in the transverse sections 9 to 12 might be that Smith's Island Bar is shifting, but more especially above Arch street, from there to the Elbow at Cooper's Point. Cross.sections 13, 14, and 15 show the changes at the Elbow at Cooper's Point. The encroachment 011 tl1e channel by tlie building out of the wharves is still apparent, but the large sectional area in this bend was not affect~d to such a degree as the part of the stream below this point. Tbt· remaining cross-sectionA from No. 16 to 21 give the changes in the north channel of Petty's Island, and those from No. ~2 to 29 show the same for the south channel along the Jersey shore. 1 had intended to deduce from these sections the comparative value of the two channels for the 1liffere.nt dates of the surveys, but will have to postpone this inquiry to a future occasion for want of time. Trusting tbat these plats may be of use in the future study of the changes and projected improvements for this part of the Delaware, I respectfully 1mbmit them. Very respectfully,
an alarming rate, in one case 300 feet since the survey of 1878.

ON THE HARMONIC ANALYSIS OF THE TIDES AT GOVERNOR'S ISLAND, NEW YORK HARBOR.
By "W"ILLIAM FERREL.

w ASHINGTON, D. c., June 30, 1884. Srn: I have the honor to submit the following report on t.be harmonic analysis of the hourl,\co-ordinates of the heights of the tides at Governor's Island, in New York Harbor, for the years 1876-1878, inclnsive. The situation of the tide.station with regard to the entrance to the harbor and the hydrography of the vicinity can be best understood by a reference to the accompanying sketch (No. 35). The hourly co-ordinates, measured from the curves of the self.registering tidegauge, were furnished to. me by Mr. R. S. Avery, chief of the Tidal Division. The series was nearly perfect, only a few co-ordinates having been supplied by interpolation. The methocl of analysis was the same as that followed heretofore, the principles of which were explained, and rules, formulre, and examples of the various reductions given, in Appendix ~o. 11 of the Report of' the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1878, in which were discussed the tilfos of Penobscot Bay. We shall, therefore, present here, for the most part, the results merely of the analysis, since to give the work in detail, with examples of the various reductions, would be in a great measure a repetition of what has already been published. As the tide-station of Governor's Island is only about 20 miles from that of Sanely Hook, there is not only a very great similarity in the tides of the two stations, but the amplitudes of all the se11arate components are very nearly ·the same for b"oth. The epochs, however, at Governor's Island, as was to be expected, are somewhat greater, being such as to cause the tides to be about 29 minutes later tba.n at Sandy Hook. The tides, therefore, do not seem to be much affected b.r waves coming through Hell-Gate from the tides in the Sound above. The three years included in thiR analysis are the same as the first three of the six years embraced in the analysis of the Sandy Hook tides. It is interesting to compare the results at the two stations for each of these three years, and observe how nearly the amplitudes of the se,·eral com· ponents agree, with the exception of a very small regular and proportionate difference, aml al1>0 the epochs of these components. To facilitate the comparison of the averages of the amplitudes and· epochs of the two analyses, those of Sandy Hook are given here by the side of those of Gornrnor's Island.
RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS ·

. The amplitudes and epochs, as given in the following results of the analysis, have all the rednctions applied, so that one year is comparable with another and .with the mean of all, and the small dUferences from year to year are simply such as result from an incomplete elimination, with only one year's observations, of a.II the abnormal disturbances arising from winds and changes of barometric pressure, and a.Iso in some measure from unavoidable imperfections of the obsen·ations. It is seen, however, that the differences in the amplitudes from year to year are extremely small, and likewise between each year and the average of all. The epochs also agree very well in all C&t!e8 in which the amplitude is sufficiently large to determine them, but of course when the amplitudes are very small there are great uncertainties in the values of the epochs as brought out in the analysis, and a. nice agreement cannot be expected.

It was not thought worth while to extend the analysis to several other smaller cornpouents of which the amplitudes are less than one inch in the Sandy Hook tides, since, oa account of the near agreement of those above, mostly with the amplitudes and epochs of the Sandy Hook tides, there could be no sensible differeuce in these smaller components. If we take the amplitudes and epochs of the four })rincipal semi-diurnal components and likewise of the three diurnal components, for both Governor's Island and Sandy Hook, we have the following relations between them :

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

If to the amplitudes of Governor's Island we add one-twentieth part we get those of Sandy Hook, iu both the diurnal and semi-diurnal components, within one-fifth of an inch, and much less, exce1lt in the case of the semi-diurnal solar component, and the greatest difference without this reductiou, which is in the case of the meau semi-diurnal lunar component, is only 0.097 of a foot. Ju the epochs the difference is 14° for the mean lunar semi-diurnal component, which should luffe much the greatest weight in the determination 011 account of its comparatively large amplitude, but the aYerage of all is 120.u. Iu the principal diurnal component it is 150.s, though in the two other very small components, with amplitudes so small that tht1 epochs cannot be accurately broughtont i11 theaualysis, they are much less. Putting, therefore, the geueraldifferenceoftheepochs for both diurnal and semi-diurnal components at 14°, as given by the principal semi-diurnal component, this girns 28 lunar or about ~m solar minutes for the time that the tide occurs at Governoi:'s Island after the time of the tide at Sandy Hook. Considering the small difference in the amplitudes of the co1hponents of the two stations, this is the only correction required to reduce the tidepredictions of Sandy Hook to those of Governor's Island with sufficient accuracy for any practical purposes; but if thought desirable the height of the tide above or below mean level can be diminished one-twentieth, a correction which would amount on the average to one-tenth of a foot. These results, therefore, show that it will be unnecessary to make separate tide-predictions by means of the machine, or otherwise, for both Sandy Hook and Governor's Island, but that the latter may be obtained from the former with sufficient accuracy by simply adding 29 minutes to the times. The heights of mean le\"el, A 0 , above the zero of the tide-gauge, indicate that this zero changed its level at the rate of 0.26 feet, or about 3 inches, in two years, a.s there seems to be .a gradual increase in the values of A 0 for the several years.
DETERMINATION OF GENERAL CONSTANTS.

In the tidal theory there are certain constants which have to be determined from observation for each tide-station, as explained in Appendix No. 11 of the Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1878. From the theoretical relations of the three principal diurnal comt>or1ents given in section 31 of that Appendix we get from the results of the analysis for Governor's Island the following three Pquatious:

o.320 - o.6 oµ= (.5306-13.1 oµ) (1 + .230E) Ao .157 = .3813 (1 - .230 E) Ao .105 = (.1730 -13.6 oµ) (1 + .196 E) Ao

The solution of these equations gives
oµ=-.0005
A 0 =0.505

E=-0.788

In making out the preceding conditions it was assumed that the moon's mass µ is equal 0.0125 of the earth's mass. The preceding conditions give a correction for this assumed mass of oµ = - .0005. With this correction we get µ

= 0.0125 -

.0005 = 0.012

1 = 83

for tlie moo11's mass. This, we have reason to think, is about its true mass, but the result mnst be regarded as being in some measure accidental, for the amplitudes of the diurnal tide are too small in the Atlantic Ocean to obtain an accurate determination of the moon's mass; and, besides, these relations are generally disturbed by shallow-water components of the same period, where there are sensible components of this sort, as there are, except in very deep water. From the relations of the first two equations in section 32 of the Appendix referred t.o above, we get with the epochs of K 1 a.nd 0 1 in the preceding reaultil

1000.9 == Lo+ 130.18 G 1030.2 == Lo-180.18 G

UNITED STATES COAST AND GJilODETIO SURVEY.
From these we get Lo=104°.5 and G=O.l. From the ftrst of these we get

· =7 hollrs nearly 140.492 for the mean time by which the diurnal tide follows the upper transit of the mean moon. The value of G, above, indicates that the maximum of the diurnal tide follows the maximum of the forces by 0.1 of a day. From the relations of section 33 in the Appendix, referred to above, we get, with the amplitudes of these components in the preceding results,
.1931 c=(.4852-36.2) (l+.425 E) .0573 c=(.1256-3.2 oµ) (l+.460 E) .2218 c= .1922 (1-.228 E)

1040 5

The solution of these equations gives ,
oµ=.0025 c=l.0750 E=-1.117

The :first of these, as a correction for the moon's mass, give11

for the moon's mass. The preceding conditions, which are essentially those used by Laplace, have always given a mass too large, the mass ohtainerl by Laplace being about 7\ . But the declination inequality wl1ich enters into these conditions is only 1..5 inches in amplitude, and hence it is too small to base a reliable determination upon it. The constant c being greater, as usual, than unity, indicates that the amplitudes of the smaller component, in being superimposed upon the mean and principal lunar component, are decreased about one.thirteenth, from the effect of friction being as a power greater than the firs· power of the velocity. From the relations of the first two equations of section 34: of the same Appendix, we get
2310.0 L 0 2570,1 = L 0 + 24P.4G.

=

With the value of L 0 in the first equation, we get from the second G = 1.07, which indicates that the maximum of the semi-diurnal tides follows the maximum of the forces by 1.07 of a day. With the value of L 0, we get 2iso.9i:;4 2310.0 - 7 97 h

.

ours -

as the time by which the high-water of the lunar semi-diurnal component follows the transit of the mean moon over the meridian. None of the preceding general constants differs much from those obtained in the same manner from the results of the analysis of Sandy Hook. I have the honor to be, very respectfally, yours,

Washington, January 26, 1885. DEAR BIR: In carrying out the instructions of the Superintendent dated January 27, instant, you:wm be guided as far as possible .by the following considerations: In runuing the lines of soundings on the Florida. coast and in the northwest Providence Chaunel it is desirable to take serial temperatures in crossing the Gulf Stream, but in the event of ba<l weather coming oo, necessitating an abandoning of any line, it is not advisable to expend much coal in the endeavor to execute this part of the work, as tbe primary object of the season will be to make complete current observations, and nothing should be allowed to hazard the success of that undertaking that can he foreseen. In taking the current observations it is desired to obtain a complete series at five or seven sta, 495

tions across the G11lf Stream between Oape Florida and G11n Cay, Bahama Banks, of snrfa.ce, fifty fathoms, and at some depth between that and the bottom, occupying each station twenty-four or more hours at points at which it is possible to anchor. Between Cuba and Yucatan the depth of water will probably prevent anchoring in a pa.rt of the passage about sixty-five miles in width. On this part you will make at least one drifting observation, making three trials from the same point, with buoys for surface-currents and also for sub-currents at fifty or more fathoms depth. One series in the Str.aits of Florida and one to the westward of Ouba are necessary, but it is very desirable also to make a second trial in the former, occupying one of the first stations at a different phase of the moon. In this second trial the weather will probably be more settled, and it is advisable to endeavor to make observations at one point for a long interval rather than to. occupy more stations for shorter lengths of time. Very respectfully, C. M. OHESTER, Oomma.nder, U.S. N., and Hydrographic Inspector Coast and Geodetic Survey. Lieut. J. E. PILLSBURY, u. s. N., Commanding Steamer Blake, Washington, D. 0.

REPORT.

U.S.

COAST .A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY,

Steamer Bl<ike, October 5, 1885. SIR: I ha\fe the honor to make the following report, of the season's work at Gulf Stream current observations, in obedience to the instructions of the Superintendent, dated Jannary 27. As this is the first sea.sou in which the party under my charge has been engaged in ooservations of this character, and as I believe it is the first attempt by any party to use the methods which were used by us, and also because I think that the student of the results should have a full knowledge of the met.h0tls, I veuture, even at the ri~k of submitting a rather voluminous report, to explain the instruments used to obtain the observations and the manner of using them. The object of the cruise was to anchor in the deep water of the Gulf Stream, and to observe the currents from the vessel so anchored. The first thing therefore to do, was to devise a method of' anchoring the vessel expeditiously, with certainty, and with safety to the vessel and appliances. The Blake was formerly fitted with dredging gear, and for the sake of economy all the parts of this apparatns which could be used were incorporated in the arrangements made for anchoring. Without stopping to explain the reasons for discarding various ideas which were presented for overcoming the enormous strains in anchoring, or to give the reasons why oortain other ideas were adopted, I will at once give a description of the gear used. It was thought to 1be absolutely necessary to relieve the sudden strain (due to the motion of the vessel) on the anchoring cable. To do this a heavy spar or boom (s, illustration 36, fig. 3) was attached by a goose-neck t,o the pawl-bitt (t) in the bow. This boom was held up by a steel-wire rope or topping-lift (a) at an angle of about45o. The topping.lift rove through a large block (v) at the masthead, and thence through another large block on the deck, the same distanCP. abaft the mast that tne end of the boom WM forward of it. At the end of the Jift abaft the block was attached an arrangement of rubber butters about 8 foot long, into which was hooked a powerful puwhase. It will be seen that upon any weight coming on the end of tbe boom .the strain wtt.s transferred by straight thrust to the pawl-bitt, a straight thrust downward on the mast, and a pull_ forward on the rubber bufters compressing them. This arrangement worked admirably with great straim:1, but the pitching of the veBBel, camring the wire-rope toppiag·lit't to continually move the sheaves of the two blooks over which it rove,, necessitated a. change. The rubber accumulator (w) was then placed betw~ the boom and the topping-lift, and DO trouble was afterward experienced. The anchoring line at first used, ormtiler tried, was the old dredge-rope of galvanized steel wire. This was a Iitt.l~ more than I .illeh

in diameter, but it was soon discarded as being altogether too weak, and another oue of if and ~ inch diameter used. This line was carried on the old dredge-reel, and led from it to the ma.in reeling engine, and thence through a large leading block (x) at the outer eud of the ooom. 'l'he leading bloeks were of very heavy make, with sheaves nearly 2 feet in diamPter. During the cruise four of the straps of these blocks showed signs of giving way, but the weakness was discovered in time, so that no accident happened. The operation of anchoring was as follows: The anchor (about 700 pounds in weight) w~ bung by the anchoring-rope fr-0m the end of the boom; at the signal, the men at the reel-brake and reeling-engine brake eased tllem slightly and allowed the rope to pay out, keeping as nearly as possible an even speed of ab-Out 60 or 70 fathoms per minute. Upon tbe anchor touching the b-Ottom, if it was not paying out faster than this, the rope would stop running, and the register being read, the depth was known. The rope was then paid out slowly, the anchor dragging along the bottom and the ship drifting. If the anchor nipped, the boom would immediately come down more or less, depending upon the current, and the rubber buffers would compreSl3. After a certain scope was out, generally about twice the depth, the rope was secured by a screw clamp, .so 88 t-0 relieve the strain on the reeling-engine and reel. We found that in heaving in we collld always t;ell when the anchor ceased to hold on the bottom by the jumping of the boom. With SOO or more fathoms of rope out, the time of heaving in and securing the anchor was generally less than 45 minutes, including getting in the jackstay (which will be explained further on), the ship's engines being used ro st;ea.m a.bead, so as t-0 ease the strain. WHh but little current the reeling. engine could heave in the anchoring.rope more than 50 fathoms per minute. The instrument devised by me to obtain the strength and direction of the currents at any depth consi8t.s of a frooJy.moving rudder of thin metal (a). (See illustration 38, figures 1 and 2.) On the front of this, and attached to the rodder, is a set of four m~tal cones (b}, placed at the extremities of two arms or spokes which are at right angles to each other. The cones are attached to the arms in such a way that the center of the base of each is equidistant from the center of the spokes, and the apices of all point in the same directfon with reference t-0 the spokes, so that when in the current the base of the cone above the axis is towarcls the current and the apex of the cone diametrically opposite. At the axis of the system is a small ·shaft turning in points, and by a worm on it turtiing as it revoh·es differe11tial wheels (c) which register revolutions. Below the rudder is a oompas~ bowl (d) and needle hung in gimbals, and a device (e) by which the needle can be lifted and clamped at any time. The rod performing this (f) runs through the stem on which the rudder swings, and attached to the same rod a system of levers (g), fast to the rudder, clamps its motion in a notched ring (k) surrounding the rudder at its middle. .A.ttacb~ ro the levers are two horizontal wings or fins (k), so arranged tha.t when the instrument is moving upward through the water the pn.>ssure of the water on them will clamp the rudder in the notched ring a.nd will lift, the compass neetlle, thus fixing the angle between the rudder and needle, and it remains fixed as long as the instrument bas an upward motion. .Above the rudder is a small propeller (l), arr1mged in such a way that it will give downward motion to its shaft when the meter bas upward motion. The shaft moves through the center of the rudder shaft, and communicates by a small st;em to the fius and levers described. The office of this propeller is to lock the tins after · they have already clamped the needle and rudder. The whole arrangement worked well, the propeller looking when palled through a space of 15 fathoms at good speed. The working parts of the met.er are inclosed in a. strong metal frame, which is hnng in trunnions or gimbals (m), so that by attaehiog a weight at its lower end (n) it remained in a vertical position. A value for the divisions on the regist;er or the number of revolutions of the speed indicator per knot oould be obtained only by comparisons with the log, and every opportunity was taken to make the oompari$on. .A 21-foot pole was used iDstead of a log chip, and the meter was lowered to 3g fathoms. Some of the register readings with currents of a.bout half a knot as shown by the pole were about 100 turns Jess than with a stronger clll'rent, but it was thought that this discrep: -.ncy was due t.o eTfOl' of pole rather tba.n error of meter, and therefore an average of all wa.s . a.et)epted. When it is remtm1bered that 100 turns of the speed indicator in any case are less tha.n ooe..t.onth of a knot, the error of the mean, it will be seen, can be bnt little. The meter as at first made had a amall wing attached t.o the rudder, which was intended to hold the speed indicator

from turning as it was lowered, and another device on the propeller stem for st,opping it when the propeller was screwed down in hoisting. The fear of uncertainty of action of the former led tQ its abandonment, and with the latter the speed of hoisting cause1l sncll a variation in the amount of water through which it should he pulled to loek that I was Jed to discard it also, and to depend altogether on a correction to be applieil. The speed indicator turning a given number of revolutions when passing through a given dis· tance in water, the correction due to hoisting and lowering could be known, and also knowing the speed of the intervening currents between the surface and the point of lowering and the time, the speed of the av-erage current was taken as the one causing the error. The two forces turning the speed indicator were, the upward flow of the water in lowering a given distance and the downward flow in hoisting the same, and the mean horizontal flow from the time of touching the water to_the time of stopping, and from the time of starting to hoist until the meter was out of water. These forces were given a value in terms of revolutions, one being the base of the triangle and the other the perpendicular, and from Bowditch table II the hypothennse taken. For example, the meter being lowered to 15 fathoms in a mean curre11t of two knots, the time of lowering being 20 seconds and the time of hoisting 25 seconds, the nnrnber of revolutions in 45 seconds in a two· knot current would be 26; the nnmber caused by lowering and hoi:,;t.iug through 15 fathoms would be 30. From Bowditch table II we take out 40 as t.he corrention to be subtracted from the register reading to give the number of turns caused by the current at the depth required. In order to test the regularity of revolution, at some of the stations every alternate observation was made at the same depth, under the supposition that in short1ntervals of t.ime grea.t changes in velocity will not take place. These curves are surprisingly regular, all(l as the observations were taktJn for this test at 130 fathoms depth, where the correction is large, the regularit,r of the curves confirms in a meas· ure the accuracy of the method of correction. It hardly seems possible that there can be au error in the greatest correction of 10 revolutions, which would be less than one one· hundredth of one knot. In order to prevent the meter from being swept astern by the force of the current the following arrangement was provided: A strong wire called a jack-stay was attached to a boat anchor and three shot and sent to the bottom after the ship's anchor was down. The ship's anchoring rope was then veered so that the vessel dropped astern until thejack->1tay wire was np and down; the meter was then attached to this wire by a metal ro(l and roller called a traveler. It was found that it was very difficult to keep this jack-stay from dragging over the hott.om ; it was therefore abandoned and the following substituted : When the ship's anchor was on the bottom a piece of line, the length of which depended on the depth of water, was attached to the anchoring rope; at the other end of the line were attached three shot. and the jack-stay wire, and both the jack-stay and anchoring rope veered !I.Way together. The line was only to act as an anchor on the jackstay to prevent it dragging, and the weight of the shot to keep it vertical. It wai;; found to work very well. The meter was lowered attached to the jack-stay wire by the traveler as described. The meter· wire was swept aft., forming a considerable curve with the greater depths, and it was a matter of doubt as to what w1is the actual depth of the meter below the surface. As deep as 100 fathoms the actual position was found by using a Bassnett's sounding-rod, which is a register of depth depending upon pressure. The proportion of wire to pay out to carry the meter to a certain depth was thus known for all but the greater depths, and with these judgment was used based on the experience of the others. At 65 fathoms from 6 to 30 fathoms more had to be veered. At 130 fathoms, from 20 to 60 fathoms additional. The actual depth of the meter as giveu in the record I believe to be correct to within -0 per cent. Greater depths conld have been obtained if we oould have used heavier weightiS on the meter, but having out the one instrument I hesitated to do anything that would risk it until the sea.son was successful in the amount and kind of the work attempted. The effect of the bight or mid· die of the wire being swept aft by the current would be t.o raise the meter above tbedeptb desired into a stronger current. The register wonld then show all the 11.o.ctuationa in the eob-eurrent.s that were found on the surface. The trnstworthio088 of the meter in the sub-ettrrenta i8 shown by the

variations, for in many instances the velocity of the sub-current did not increase or decrease with the surface, although in most instances it did. The most serious difficulties in connection with the meter were these: 'fhe compass-needle was gold-plated, silver-plated, and covered with shellac, and iu spite of these coverings the rust would come through; the needle became pitted and lost its directiYe force somewhat, but the latter was corrected by remagnetizing it by means of the Brush dynamo. The rust collected about the pivot a.nd in a short time blunted it su that the needle woultl hardly move. Whenever a series of observa.tiom; were completed, and oftentirne:,; in the middle of a series, the meter wa.s taken up and the pivot filed and the needle cleaned. Considera.hle trouble was experienced from sea-nettles, with which at times it seems the Gulf Stream abounds. These nettles are in appearance about like sewing-silk, and if one of them became attached to the registering gear in any way it1i1 motion was retarded. A thorough inspection was made each time, and if there was any doubt of the correctness of the reading of the register the observation was duplicated. Of course there are some errors which may have escaped notice, but every care was exercised, and, I believe, the errors are very few. The meter was only experimental-that is to say, it being the first of its kind, there was no certainty that it would work. It was found, however, that with the exceptious mentioned (discarding the arrangement for locking the speed indicator), but one other change was necessary, which was to substitute a propeller with three blades instead of two. One or two additional changes have been made with the new meters, by which they can be taken apart more easily, but these are not essential for accuracy. · The original instructions received from your predecessor, dated January 27, directed me to mske a series of observations in the Gulf Stream between Fowey Rocks and Gun Cay, to be followed by similar observations between Cuba and Yucatan, and these to be followed by another series at the first station. I first made five or six trial anchorages fort.he purpose of testing the gear, and iu one of these, near the Yucatan Bank, I discovered evidence of tidal a.ction at 75 fathoms depth. Surmising that perhaps a thoroughly exhaustive examination at Fowey Rocks could not be made, under certain circumstances, in the time allotted, I requested yon, through the Hydrographic Inspector, for authority to modif'.y the scheme lai<l out, if I should deem it for the best interest of the sur>ey, after I had made the first set. of observations. On the first set I felt confident that tidal a.c· tion was noticeable, or at any rate something caused a fluctuation in the strength of the daily flow. I also found that the axis of the stream was not situated near the position supposed by Professor Bache. I found, too, that the strength of the current at 80me station~ was on the surface, while in others it was below, aud the contrary re:,;ults I attributed to laok of observations. My conclu· sions were, therefore, that exhaustive research at one place would give more positive results to the survey in the cause of science and hydrography than only a partial examination at two places, and I trust that as ~on examine the record yon will consider that my decision was well taken. It was my intention, in laying out a scheme of action to follow in taking the observations, to occupy certain stations at about the first and third quarters of the moon, and again at new and full moom~, at exactly the same rela.tive times at each. Oould I have had good weatuer this scheme could have been carried out, but unfortunately good onlinary weather does not mean good anchoring weather in 500 fathoms of water. I found it impossible to follow any scheme exactly. With a moderate easterly breeze the west side of the stream was too rough; with a westerly one the east side had to be avoided. In any place we had to get under way at a squall if it was thought to be ·vy. I presume many times that we did get under way we could have remained, but with no duplicate gear on board I wa,s afraid to risk carrying it away until I had made a successful season. I feared, too, in ease of au accident, there might be some loBB of life. The anchoring rope with a strong current was probably standing a strain of eight or ten tons, the topping-lift and bnfi6rs even i. greater strain, and with these forces distributed abo11t the ship ou both sides and aloft, if anything did go it could hardly mi88 injuring some one, if not worse. As the season progressed, and the weak points in the anchoring gear had been strengthened as defects appeared, we were at last able to ride through squalls of oonsid.erable force without fear of carrying away anything. I presume in the future there will be .ma.ny series of current observations across the Gulf Stream, and as this is the narrowest part of the stream, 1 have given it the name of "Gross Section A» (see sket.e.b. 37}. The ourreut stations I numbered in snooessi.on from west to east-1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

The second time I occupied a station I gave it, in addition to a number, a letter, thus, la,2a, &c., and the third time, lb, 2b, &c. (See sketch 38). The same number indicates observations ta.ken at about the same position. The observations were taken at 3z, 15, 30, 65 1 and 130 fathoms, and at one or two stations at 2 fathoms and 210 fathoms. D11ring the earlier part of the season the meter wa.s allowed an interval of thirty minutes to register at all depths, except in some instances, when dupl~ate observations were taken. Dtiring the latter part of the season the observations at ~ fathoms generally took fifteen minutes, at 15 fathoms twenty minutes, and other depths thirty minutes. It was thought that the multiplication of an error in the record of the currents of the upper strata, where the total correction in any event would be small, would give results of the same correctness as in the lower strata, wl1ere the corrections are large. In other words, the error at fathoms multiplied by 4- would be as correct as the error at 130 fathoms multiplied by 2. The observations for velocity taken on stations 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are more liable to error than on the other stations, for the reason that during these observations the propeller was used to lock the velocity apparatus, and an uncertainty exists as to the exact length of time required to com. pletely lock. It is thought, however, that the greatest possible error due to this defect would be expressed by a number of revolutions equal to one-third the depth at which the observation is· taken-that is, at 30 fathoms, a possible error of ten revolutions, and RO on. On all other stations it is believed that an error of ten revolutions would be excessive on even the greatest depth. Efforts were made to obtain temperatures at the various depths by attaching thermometers to the uieter wire, but they were not successful. The meter wire had a continual vibration when in use, and the index of the thermometers (Miller-Casella) would become shaken up, in some instances even into the bulb. The Negretti-Zambra thermometers were found to turn by the force of the current in too short a time to allow them to register properly. The observations for teruJ>erature were consequently given up during the latter part of the sea."!on, and it is proposed for next season to have a small rubber arrangement made by which the vibration will be overcome and the thermometers register correctly. The appended curves of currents at same depths (illustrations 41 to 46, inclusive) repr~~nt the actual observations plotted according to time and revolutions of the meter. In strict truth, our whole knowledge of' the currents is confined to the observations, and perhaps it is unwarranted to connect the points by curves instead of straight lines. I believe, however, that the curves more truly represent the actual change, or the condition of the currents at any time. On these sheets, near the middle or at the lower edges, are shown the times of the meridian passage (upper transit,) of the moon, and the declination each day. All times are local apparent time. On these curves doubtful observations a.re inserted, bnt are connected by light dotted lines. The vertical curves in heavy black broken lines (illustration 43) are the means of the actual obser. vations; those in lighter broken lines are constructed from the means ta.ken from the curves of velocities at the same depth. Illustration 40 shows the approximate declination of the moon during the season, with the position of each station with reference to the declination and phase plotted at its proper place. · Illustration 39 shows the profile of the bottom on the upper half, and below is a curve which represeutt1 a portion of ihe monthly variation iu velocity of the current at No.1 station. The points are plotted on the co-ordinates of the moon's declination a.nd velocity, the mean of the surface velocity and the approximate declination for the middle time being ta.ken. From this curve, which inclmles declinations from about 60 south, increasing to the greatest southing, and thence to about mo north, it will be seen that apparently the velocity remains nearly constant until the greateet declination is reached, when it increases rapidly until a day or two after the greatest southing, and then decreases again, probably to go through the same fluctuation with northern declination. That this is an invariable rule there are no means of determining with only the meager data thus far obtained, and I have only introduced this curve as an assistance in laying out a scheme for future investigation. That there is a diurnal fluctuation in the velocity of the stream l think cannot l>e doubted, and it would seem that this daiJs variation may have given rise to the commonly accepted theory that the axis of the stream varies in position, sometimes daily. The axis of the stream, or the line of maximum velocity, may change somewhat, but the evidence of this change in any of our observations is wanting, with the exeeption poeaibly of station No. 5, where a difference of nearly one knot was observed with the same declination of the moon on different months. So many other factors may combine to eauae ftu.ctnationa, aueh ..

strong easterly or westerly winds in the Gulf of Mexico, banking up or reducing the level of the fountain bead; the same to the north ward and eastward beyond the Little Bahamas; much difference in barometric level between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, &c., that the evidence from one observation at station No. 5 I do not consider in other light than a variation to the rule. The observations taken for many days at station No. 1 seem to point to a fairly regular flow, and I think it probable that any abnormal cause will affect the whole surface flow, only to retard - or accelerate the velocity, and not to change the position of the line of greatest velocity abruptl_y, or, indeed, to any very great extent. The velocity of the surface current at times was less than the velocity of the sub-currents. On line lb this is particularly noticeable, where, in every instanoe, at about the time of the minimum daily velocity, the surface speed feU below that at 15 fathoms, and at times below that at 30 fathoms. In other words, the amount of the daily fluctuation was greatest at the surface. That this was caused by local winds there is no evidence. During this week the winds were light and blowing from no one direction longer than a few hours, and at times when the wind was northerly the velocity was greatest, and when southerly the current was weak. In fact, I could discover no connection between the velocity of the current and tb:e wind, either at the time it was blowing or afterwards, which would cause the variations in the flow of the former. It will be seen from the vertical curves (illustration 43) that (while the surface velocity fell below the sub-surface at times) the mean velocity at the surface was greater than any of those below. The mean depth of the water at the stations used in vertical curve "B " is about 350 fathoms, and for curve "A" 204 fathoms. Continuing the curves it will be seen that they reach zero velocity at about the time they reach the bottom. This, however, does not sel'm to be true, for the vertical curve of station 5a, 8howu on illustration 45. At this station the velocities of the sub-currents are more nearly equal to the surface than on any other etatiou, and the daily changes are Jess. I regret that there are any apparently unreconcilable results in the record obtained, but perhaps when it is studied by some of the scientific gentlemen who have devoted their lives to this and kindred subjects, many points which seem to be inconsistencies now will°be solved, and with the addition of the record of one or two more successful seasons at the same place some of the laws governing this wonderful river of the ocean will be made plain. Too much credit for the success of the season's work cannot be given to· the officers of the vessel. They performed their dut.y in every particular with the grea.test care, zea.t, and int.elligence, and in work so continuous it is a wonder that there are not more erroneous readings or recordings than there seem to be in this record. Respectfully, &c., J. E. PILLSBURY, Lieutenant, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Gwdetic Survey. Mr. F. M. THORN, Superintendent Coast and Geodetic Survey.

No. 15.

NOTE ON A DEVICE FOR ABBREVIATING TIME REDUCTIONS.
By C. S. PEIRCE, Assistant.

The simple suggestion that I wish to make is that by m ultiplyiug the obsen·ed times of transit (after applying a provisional correction aud subtracting the right ascension) by the cosine of the declination, the field reduction is much facilitated, and tlle labor of tbe least.square reduction is decidedly lessened. This arises from two circumstances: First, that the azimuth, level, aud colli· mation coefficients are much quicker taken out, and for uorthem stars quicker used; and sccoml, that the weights to be assigned to tlle observations ham a small range and art» readily applied, while in a rough reduction they may be omitted wirhont <lisa1lvantage. The following are the values of the coefficieu ti:;:
Old way. · Azimuth. : Level. : Collimation. sin.; sec J
cost; sec

N'ew way. sin (

a

±sec&

cos' ±I

The old coefficients have to be taken out of a table of double·entry (which is always disagreeable), and this table extends over eight pages <]lrnrto at least.

'l'hus, for tlie large iIH<truments, the weight ranges only from 1 at the equator to 3.06 at the pole, and for the rmiall iustruments from l to 1.6. The olcl way of reducing observations, as if all the time~ lrnd t·qual weight, is entirely inadmissible e'Teu in a rough field-reduction. Rut after mnltipl)·ing hy cos o, observatio11s with the small iustruments may he treated as of equal weight; while with large inRtrume11ts, in a not "\"Cr)· refined reduction, we may use the rule that P = 1 from the equator to 4J 0 of declinatiou, r = 2 from 410 to 70°, and P = 3 from 7110 to the pole.

In a field-reduction, the unknown chronometer correction being small, the azimuth will be determilled in each position by a north and a south star, and the residual D calculated for each star. This is corrected for aberration, and then the simple half difference of the mean residuals in the two positions of the instrument is the collimation, while the half sum (taking only high stars) is the chronometer error multiplied by the cosine of the latitude. In reducing b;y least squares, we have the same quantities to calculate as by the old way; but these are obtained in a different manner, as shown by the following formulre. The multiplications are generally easier by the new method. Qtl.antitiea med in least &quare work.

ON THE INFLUENCE OF A NODDY ON THE PERIOD OF .A PENDULUM.
By C. S. PEIRCE, Assi,.tant.

Suppose a noddy, adjusted to accord with a reversible pendulum, remain on _the pendulumsupport throughout the experiments to determine gravity. How much can the results be affected by this circumstance T Let us use this notation: land zt, the lengths of the single pendulums corresponding to the pendulum and noddy, respectively; that is, in each case the square of the radius of gyration divided by the distance between the center of mass and center of rotation; µand µ',the ratio of any linear displacement of the support to the angular displacement of the pendulum or noddy required to produce it; -r and T' the natural periods of peudulum and noddy; T the period of either harmonic constituent of the motion. Then, the form.ula, easily derived from my paper on two pendulums on one tmpport, is:

sm.all~r,

Any increase of r' always produces an increase of T; and of the two values of T2, one is always the other greater than

Consequently, the greatest effect is produced when one value of T2 is as much greater as the other is less than

that is, when

THE EFFECT OF UNEQUAL TEMPERATURE UPON A REVERSIBLE PENDULUM.
By C. S. PEIRCE, Assistant.

The upper part of a pemlulum swinging in a room not very lofty is always warmer than the lower part. Let us suppose that the temperature varies uniformly along the length of the pendulum. A reversible pendulum consists of two parts, (first) the part symmetrical about the middle of the pendulum, and (second) the load, however distributed. We may distinguish letters referring to .these two parts by the subjaceut indices 1 and 2. Letters without an index may refer to the whole pendulum. Considering, :first, the symmetrical part, it is plain that the inequality of temperature cannot sensibly alter the radius of gyration of this about its center of mass, which depends on the mean temperature only, since the center of mass of this part is at the center of the pendulum. The distance of the center of mass from the supporting knife-edge will, however, be increased, sa;y, by t:f. Then, if M stand for mass, i for the length of the corresponding simple pendulum, and h for the distance of the centre of mass from the point of support, the moment of inertia will be (neglecting <12) that is, it will be multiplied by

. But the moment of gravity will be so that it will also be multiplied by

and the period of oscillation, which depends on the ratio of the mQment of inertia to the moment of gravity,. wm not be affected. Let us now consider the load, which we may suppose to be symmetrical a.bout its middle. Denote the distance of its center from that of the pendulum by 17. Let or be the excess of the

temperature of U1e upper knife above that of the lower one.

Then !J or will be the difference of

temperature of the center of the load from the mean temperature of the pendulum. It will have the min'US sign with heavy end down, the plus sign with heavy end up. Let k be the coefficient of expansion. Then, every dimension of the load will, owing to the inequality of temperature, be multiplied by

1 =ftkOr, where the double sign corresponds to the two positions of the pendulum. The radiu.1 of gyrati9n about the center of the load (which we may denote by y2} will be multiplied by the same amount;

and cousequently the moment of iuertia and the square of the period of oscillation will be multiplied by

The middle of the distance from the SUJlJ>Orting knife-edge to the center of the load will be at a distance =f ~11+ tl above the center of the pendulum in the two positions, and this distance will be

In order to make these effects as small as possible, the load should be concentrated as much as possible about one knife-edge. For this purpose, the symmetrical part might be an unloaded tube about v'3 times the distance between the knife-edges in length. This construction wonld also have the advantage of eliminating the error due to the :fiexnre of the pendulum sta.IJ: Jn the case of the Peirce metre pendulums, we have

TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF HENRY W. BLAIR, ASSIST.A.NT.

By the death of Assistant HENRY W .A. YNE BLAIR the Coast and Geodetic Survey bns lost a young officer of marked a\Jility and high character; one of whom it is not too mucll to sa.r that had he lived be would have stood among tlle foremost in ra11k on the work. Mr. Blair was born in San Antonio, Texas, December 27, 1851. His father was au officer of the Army, on duty there until shortly before tbe outbreak of' the civil war. He then accompanied his parents to Virginia, their oatfre State, and during the trying years that followed, learned in his boyhood lessons of patience, forbearance, and self-denial that were deeply impressed upon hiw by the privations and sufferings of those times. In 1866 he was entered as a cadet at the Vir~inia :Military Institute, and took from the first a leailing place in scholarship, graduating in 1870 with hi~h rank. Soon after his gra<luatiou he \"rn~ appointed to an assistant professorship in the Institute, and labored in tllis position with zeal am! success, securing the entire confi<leuce of the faculty. He had, however, alwa,ys desired a life ot greater activity than was open to a teacher, an<l willingly accepted an appointment offered llim 011 the Survey, entering its service as Aid in January, 1872. The anticipations of usefulness and distinction which bis career as a student and professor had led his friends to entertain for him were not long in being fulfilled. In June, um;, be was promoted to be Subassistant. Coutiuuiug to serve with great credit, and exhibiting unusual aptitude in every branch of the work assigned to him, be was made Assistant in August, ld82, llaviu,g lwe11 previously appointed to a position invoh·ing laborious and responsible dut,y in the offiee. 'Io tlw duties of this position he devoted himself with unre-mitting energy, satisfying not only its routine requirements, but following the bent of his miud for work demandiug original investigation. Re gaYe mueh study to the subject of standard!! of weight and measure, and prepared for publication, in co.operation with the Superintendent, a report on the progress made iu the coustrnction of tlimw standards. He submitted designs for, and directed the construction of, a comparing apparatus for the micrometric comparison of standard line measures from a decimeter to a meter in length. To this apparatus was awarded a diploma at the Southern Exposition held at Louisville, wliere tlrn Survey was represented by an exhibit under l\lr. Blair's cbarge. In January, 1884, after returning from this service, he resumed his position in tbe office. It was in the summer of that year that he was taken with a lingering illness, from wllich late iu the autumn be had apparently recovered. He was on bis way to New Orleans to take charge of the exhibit of the Survey at the Cotton Centennial Exposition, aud had reached Nashville, when a relapse of bia disease prostrated his vital powers. He died Decem her 15, 1884. Mr. Blair's frank, affectionate, and n1anly nature had endearecl him to his <)Omrades; bi::~ conscientious and efficient discharge of duty won for him the respect and regard of the older officers with whom he was associated. His ambition was a lofty one; it was not so much to achieve as to deserve success. DeAp religious conviction was the guiding force of llis whole ut:'ing, and the ver:r flower and crown of his stainless life. Though lost to u1>, we have the comforting assurance Urnt he has entered upon higher activities, suistaiu~d by an uufalt~ring tmst and cberislliug an immortal hope.
