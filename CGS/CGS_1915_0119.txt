REPORT
OF THE

SUPERINTENDENT, U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY
DEPARTMENT OF COM:l\IERCE, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

Washington, D. O., October 9, 1915. Sm: There is submitted herewith the annual report 0Б the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1915.
PART I.

Part I explains the needs 0Б the Bureau by text and illustrations, and is an appeal for greater recognition 0Б its essential requirements. With the increased work in recent y-ears there has been no corresponding increase in the force and eqmpment, which is a pertinent cause for the backwardness 0Б much 0Б the work.
PART II.

Part II is a detailed statement 0Б the field and office work of the Bureau. It is accompanied by illustrations showing the progress made in the past year, as required by statute.

Part !.-NEEDS OF THE BUREAU.
NEW BUILDING.

It is an old story to again call attention to the inadequate conditions afforded this Bureau in the buildings at present occupied, which cover 70,000 square feet of floor space, distributed in such a manner that labor is difficult and expensive. One of these buildings was originally built for a hotel, and it is cut up into so many small rooms that the partitions take up much space. Because of this, no division can be properly supervised, with the possible exception of the new printing section. The buildings are five and six stories high, respectively, with 16 different levels in one and 11 in the other, and without any suitable elevator. The buildings are improperly lighted, overcrowded, and reported by the Public Health Service as being insanitary. One of the worst features of the present condition is the fact that they are not fireproof, and records that cost millions of dollars and could not be replaced short of the expenditure of other millions of dollars are constantly in danger. To attempt to remodel these present structures would avail nothing, for actual rebuilding is the only means of. providing permanent relief. It is an evident fact that the efficiency of the Bureau is daily disturbed by the incommodious office conditions, and by the inconvenience and loss of time involved in communication between widely separated portions of the buildings. The foregoing statement can not be overemphasized. The further expenditure of money on these old buildings would be an actual waste, for while they can be made to look fairly well, they are far from proving satisfactory. It is earnestly hoped that in the near future consideration will be given to the urgent necessity for an up-to-date building that will properly accommodate the officers and workrooms of this Bureau.
CONDITION OF HYDROGRAPHY.

The hydrographic survey of the coast, harbors, and approaches constitutes the most important element of the charts, and is the prime factor in promoting the safety of navigation. With this report are published four maps to illustrate the condition of the hydrographic surveys of the coasts of the United States and Alaska, all on the same scale in order that correct comparisons may be made at a glance. No. 3 shows the Atlantic coast from Maine to Georgia; No. 4, the coast of Florida and the Gulf; No. 5, the Pacific coast of California, Oregon, and Washington ; and No. 6, Alaska. The colors used on the charts to illustrate the surveys have the following signification: Wire-drag surveys completed, solid red; wire-drag surveys required, hachured red; unchangeable areas, no

present work required, solid blue; unchangeable ureas, additional work required, huchured blue; changeable ureas, recent surveys, solid yellow; changeable areas, old surveys, hachured yellow; reconnoissance иwork or unsurveyed, tinted gray. The colored areas cover regions with depths less than 100 fathoms on the Atlantic coast and 1,000 fathoms on the Pacific coast, and represent the extent to which our surveys should be prosecuted as vigorously as the facilities will permit.
TWO NEW VESSELS.

In the report of the Secretary of Commerce for the previous fiscal year the condition of some of the vessels of this service was thoroughly described with the result that Congress appropriated enough money to buy, ready built, a vessel for the work on the Atlantic coast to replace the Endeavor,- and a contract has now been let for the building of another vessel, to be known as the Surveyor, to replace the condemned 11! cArthur, for the Pacific coast and Alaskan service. This is a move in the right direction, but is far from meeting the present needs of this Bureau. On the Pacific coast two vessels should be replaced without delay by new ones suitable for work in exposed localities. The Gedney has been condemned. The Patterson, now 33 years old, is no longer serviceable for the exposed offshore work. In her weakened condition, exposure to u heavy sea might prove very serious. The vessel wus lightly built and underpowered, and the fact that in the future her work, even under favorable conditions, must necessarily be confined to protected waters, emphasizes clearly the necessity for a new vessel for work in western Alaska and on the coast of California, Oregon, and иw ushington. The Explorer also shows structural weakness, and extensive repairs are necessary; her future work should be confined absolutely to the protected waters of southeast Alaska. In view of the unsafe condition of the llfcArthur and Gedne,y and the fact that neither is seaworthy, they have been ordered sold, as their future existence is a menace to human life and their further use would be without the slightest justification. There is urgent work needed off the coasts of ""Washington. Ore~on, and California; also off central and western Alaska and Hawaii; but until the Su,1иveyor is in commission and other similar vessels are built we can not hope to accompli~h any of this work, as ut the present time there is not a vessel in the Pacific coast service sufficiently seaworthy to be exposed to the risk of this work. и The two new vessels recommended would be used in the unsurveyed and exposed offshore work on the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington, and off the central and western part of Alaska and Hawaii, where they are urgently needed.
LAUNCHES FOR INSHORE WORK AND WIRE DRAG.

In the past, the more or less established custom of the Survey seems to have been to provide an equipment of surveying vessels of a type suitable for all classes of sounding operations without

8

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

definite considerations as to either the character or location of the working grounds. Obviously, an economical and safe surveying vessel properly designed for efficient offshore hydrography should be of an ocean-going type, and consequently of considerable size and expensive to mamtain. On the other hand, a vessel properly designed for inshore or inside hydrography might be, and usually should Le, for economical reasons, a comparatively small craft. The net result of the previous custom has been that the effort to provide a type of vessel suitable for Loth classes of operations has had the unfortunate effect of giving the Survey ships which are for the greater part either too large and expensive to maintain for inside or inshore sounding or too small and unsafe for offshore operations. Our surveying vessels at present in use, while engaged on inshore work, usually anchor in protected waters and the hydrographic surveys are executed Ly utilizing ship's launches and boats frequently too small for the purpose. On offshore hydrography these same vessels being too small for safe ocean navigation, necessarily are compelled to wait for good weather Lefore going outside to do their work, and for like reasons must seek shelter whenever bad weather threatens. The Isis and Bache are performing useful and economical service on the Atlantic coast offshore work, in regions conveniently located to safe harbors. Otherwise, the Pathfinder, now in the Philippines, and the new ship, the Surveyor, now under construction, are the only vessels of the Coast Survey large and staunch enough for offshore work. None of these vessels is small enough for economical work in sheltered waters. In the. case of the wire-drag operations, neither these ships nor their launches are of suitable size for the work to be performed, and the custom has grown up of hiring or chartering at a comparatively great cost all the large launches employed on this important class of surveying work. In the future it is proposed to remedy this unsatisfactory and inefficient condition of affairs by providing vessels and launches of such types and sizes as will suit them in each case to the special work they are to perform. The question of the larger ocean-going vessels is covered more fully under a previous heading, which leaves only the "one-party launches" and "wire-drag launches" for immediate consideration in this section of this report. A large proportion of the hydrographic work of the Coast Survey is located close to shore or in inside waters. For reasons already indicate<l, "one-party launches," each with a complement of officers and crew of about 10 men, arc more economical for this class of work than the existing semiocean-going type which :frequently can employ only one or two parties on inside operations, although currying an ocean-going complement of officers and crew large enough for three or four parties. But in spite of this fact the Coast Survey has only two "one-party" vessels of inferior type (now employed in Alaska) when in reality there should be at least six on the Atlantic nnd Gulf coasts and an equal number on the Pacific coastl and in Alaskan waters.

The need for resurveys of changeable areas and the outlets of nearly all bays and inlets from Sandy Hook to the Rio Grande, for the completion of the original suneys in places, and for revision of topography due to changes all along the coast, in order to keep the charts up to date, is imperative and these will be prosecuted with greater vigor as funds are available. It can be stated here that the ever-increasing demands for new hydrographic surveys due to the increased size, draft, and speed of iohips of commerce and of war, together with the constant changes along the sandy shores of the Atlantic coast, arc already oYcrtaxing the forces and equipment of the Coast S11ney. And now that submersible war vessels, with their requirements of fairly accurate knowledge of depths of 100 feet and more, form an essential part of the national defense, the necessity for new sunиe.vs and resurveys is more pressing and Yital to the best interests of the country. As stated previously, the wire-drag s11r\"eys, which are of recent origin and which arc rapidly dewloping Yalnahle nиstilts, are exclusively carried on by the aid of hired or chartered launches. Doring the current fiscal year four separate wire-drag parties arc in operation, two in Alaska and two on the Atlantic coast. The aYerage cost for these wire-drag parties is estimated at about $20,000 each for the six or eight months' season in which they can best perform their work, or a total of $80,000 for their combined operations. As a matter of fact, the cost of rental of these launches, which are Usually poorly designed and equipped for the work to be performed, Would pay for them in three or four years if it were possible to purchase them outright; nor does this take into consideration the time lost on account of their unsuitable design. And this latter saying is no small matter, as the cost of each working day of a wire-drag party actually utilized in surveying opemtions :n"erages from $200 to $800. Therefore the money which it is hoped will be appropriated for the purchase of launches for inshore work and wire-drag operations Would result not only in considernble saving to the Gorernment but Would also add to the efficiency and consequently to the quantity of Work done.
WIRE-DRAG WORK.

Due to the increase Congress gaYe us last year we were able to 'Place in the field four parties instead of two. The resnlts prove the Wisdom and the necessity of doing this work on a much larger scale . . The use of the wire drng has revolutionized hydrogrnphic surveying. It was, of course, realized long ago that sounding with the lead ~ine, no matter how closely the soundings were spaced, was not an Infallible means of detecting submerged rocks and bowlders, and that ledB"es and shoals of considerable extent arc missed by the lead. 1'h1s fact was emphasized by many disasters to vessels and by the large number of hidden dangers "which became known and were shown on the chart only as the result of such disasters. Certain portions of omи coasts constitute a veritable ocean graveYard in which the submerged rocks arc the monuments and bear the names of the ships which were wrecked upon them. But it was not

until the method of drugging was fully developed and systematically applied that it became clearly apparent that a very large number of submerged dangers might exist, even in much-frequented waters, and remain entirely unknown an<l unsuspected simply because by fortuitous circumstances no vessel of considerable draft ever happened to pass immediately over them. This applies especially to the rockbound portions of our coasts.

The differences in cost in the same locality in the above table are due to two principal causes: 1. The initial cost includes the first cost of the outfit, a part of which is available for subsequent work. 2. Some variation is due to weather conditions which affect the number of days available for work.
INCREASED APPROPRIATION FOR MANNING AND EQUIPPING VESSELS.

The insufficient complement and equipment for our vessels is so evident that at times it seriously <listurbs the efficiency of the work.

The Lighthouse Service pays seamen $50 per month and 45 cents per day for rations, excepting Alaska where it .is 60 cents, and in addition furnishes its seamen with oilskins and sen boots. The Coast Guardи pays its seamen $44 per month and rations of 48 cents per day. The Coast and Geodetic Survey pays its sea:tnen $40 per month and 45 cents per day for rations. Besides underpaying the men of this service, they are not assured of continuous Work throughout the year, as insufficient funds make it necessary to retain only the number needed to carq on part of the work. Under the present arrangements it is extremely difficult when recruiting in the spring to get even moderately good crews, and it is usually impossible to build up a permanent organization of reliable men experienced in the specialized work which they are called upon to perform, and sufficiently devoted to the service, by reason of permanent association with it, to willingly and without protest perform extremely arduous work, which the exigencies of the service often demand. For instance, the crews on the Pacific coast are recruited at Seattle at the on~ time of the year when men of the type we are seeking are in greatest demand by the lumber interests, the canneries, and fishing fleets, which are then getting ready for their summer work. It is not an exaggeration to make the statement that 70 per cent of the men enlisted in this service, especially on the Pacific coast, come to us as a last resort. We are constantly losing time through the lack of men trained in the work of the service. The surveying vessel with all her appurtenances, is an exceedingly complex and complicated affair, and requires a correspondingly large amount of judgment to keep her in condition. Much of tlns work is of such a character that it can not be undertaken during the working season, and is therefore another reason why trained men should be kept on these vessels the year around. If the chief of the r.arty, who is the commanding officer of the vessel, is allowed to bmld up a permanent organization composed of men such as are absolutely needed for the highest standard of efficiency, then in due time he can be relied upon to greatly increase the amouut of work turned out by his vessel and to reduce the unit costs.

GEODESY-MORE FUNDS NEEDED FOR EXTENDING 'PRIMARY TRIANGULATION AND PRECISE LEVELS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ALASKA.

The guestion has been asked whether or not the geodetic work of the Umted States should be done by individual States. This must be answered in the negative, and consideration of the following facts will bear this out: It is necessary to have primary triangulation and precise leveling in each State for the framework of State and county boundary surveys; for national and local topographic, drainage, irrigation, mineral, and other surveys; and for various engineering operations. The necessity for this primary control we must accept as a fact, in view of the experiences of other nations as well as of our own. The United States is divided into 48 States, some of which are very limited in area. Each of the long arcs of prim11ry triangulation and each of the lines of precise leveling traverses several States, and it is reasonably certain that it would be difficult to obtain the cooperation of all of the States involved in any one arc or line. Take, for instance, the transcontinental arc of primary triangulation which passes through 14 States; the Texas-Califorma arc which crosses 4; and the ninety-eighth meridian arc which goes through 6. A similar condition obtains with regard to the long-level lines. But,

suppose each State were willing to do that part of the primary triangulation and precise leveling within its own area, how then could there be a comprehensive scheme :for the whole country? . It would be absolutely necessary to have a national geodetic association, with each State represented in it, and with a central bureau to direct its operations. If each State worked independently, there would be little or no agreement with the work in adjoining States, and the gaps and overlaps at the boundaries would be a constant source of trouble to surveyors and map makers. Another annoying :feature would be the lack of uniformity in the results of the work, as each State would be free to adopt its own standards of accuracy, if there were no supervising bureau. It would require many decades to complete the work, even if executed by the cooperation of all the Stutes, each covering its own territory, and then a central organization would be necessary to adjust the work of the States, and obtain from it a comprehensive whole. As a concrete example, let us consider the experience of Australia. For a number of years each State ;f that country conducted its own geodetic surveys independent1.., f the others, with the final result that, at a conference of the surveyors general, held in 1912 at Melbourne, a resolution was adopted recommending that the principal geodetic control he carried on by the Commonwealth Government. The striking provisions of this resolution are the following:
1. That a geodetic surYey of Australia should lie undertaken. 2. That, In order to give effect to the foregoing resolution, this conference respectfully recommends thut such survey he undertaken by the Commonwealth Government, und submits In support thereof the following reasons: (c) That the system which has hitherto prevailed by which the Individual Stutes cnrrle<l out this work with Instruments of varying character hns resulted in divergent standards of accuracy, rendering the work, to 11 great extent, unsntlsfnctory, mu!, though much of It Is of high grnde, portions of It are impossible of reconciliation and coortlinutlon with 11 continental scheme. (d) Tlmt the desirableness of this work being undertaken by the Commonwealth Government Is evidenced by the fact that the Geodetic Survey of the United Stutes Is curried out under the direct control of the Federal Government, and that the South African Geodetic Survey Is also under one central control.

Mr. Spowers, surveyor general of (J,ueenslandи, said:

During the discussion preceding the adoption of the resolutions

At the present time there Is no trigonometrical vote In Queensland, and only a very small areu Is covered by the major triangulation which was carried out about 1800. In addition to other reasons we are greatly In need of this survey to assist us In the correct compilation of our maps; much time is now lost und expense Incurred In endeavouring to make accurate maps from lnformntlon that Is faulty or nltogether wanting. 'Ve are In the unenviable position of being about the only civilized nation that has not an accurnte trigonometrical survey. The work Is rightly one for the Commonwealth Government to undertake.

Mr. Poate, surveyor general of New South Wales, remarked:
The geodetic survey of Austrulln should be undertaken by one body, and that body should undoubtedly be the Federnl Government, In order that one ~tundurd of uccurncy should be applied to the whole of the work, nnd thut It should be similar In character to the great geodetic surveys of the world. It should be conducted on similar lines to those ndoptcd In the United States Const Survey, and, taking the coast line first, should be gradually extended Inland.

14

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The only logical conclusion seems to be that our National Government should complete the general program which is being followed by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. This plan is, briefly, that the primary triangulation scheme and the precise-level net should be so extended that there will be no place in the United States distant more than about 100 miles from a primary triangulation station and from a precise-level bench mark. иwhether the National or State Government should execute the control work in the intermediate areas is another problem. Many of these areas will lie wholly within single States and, as far as State and local suneys and engineering works are concerned, the States could properly supplement the fundamental schemes. However, it is probable that this can not be done by the States. To carry on geodetic work requires a corps of highly trained specialists and an expensive instrumental equipment, besides trained experts to compute and adjust the results. The State engineering departments are not at present able to do this class of work. For some time after the main schemes of primary triangulation and precise leveling are completed, the National Government must furnish additional control for the national surveys and engineering. Other control for purely State, county, and city use should probably be done by the National Government, with the local political unit paying all or part of the cost. . Even greater New York was forced to have an officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to direct the primary triangulation of its area. The Survey was willing to cooperate in this work, because the results would be of great rnlue in the revision of charts in the vicinity of New York City. The city of Cincinnati requested the Coast and Geodetic Survey to detail one of its officers to direct the primary triangulation and precise leveling of that city, but as it was not practicable for this Survey to permit one of its officers to <lo this, the city of Cincinnati employed a former officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to take charge of the work. Several years ago the city of Memphis requested the Survey to extend a primary triangulation over its area, and dnring the past winter Richmond, Va., requested the Sun-ey to cooperate with it in making primary trian~lation and precise leveling over its area. In the case of Cincinnati, Memphis, and Richmond the problem was not similar to that of New York, as the results would not be of value to the Coast and Geodetic Survey in its charting work. However, in the case of Memphis an arc of primary triangulation was carried to that place from which the city may be triangulated. This arc is in the general scheme which the Survey proposes to extend over the whole country eventually. Atlanta, Ga., and Lufkin, a town in Texas, have recently requested that precise leveling bench marks be established by the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the basis of city surveys and maps. This the Survey can not do now for lack of funds. The National Government is spending several millions of dollars annually for surveys and maps of various kinds. The efficiency of this work will be materially aided by having the fundamental control extended rapidly. Accurate surveys and maps are national assets and aid materially in the industrial development of the Nation. Primary triangulation and precise leveling are not of immediate value only, for their monuments and bench marks may be used repeatedly

for an indefinite time, and in any given area, will probably never have to be duplicated. The National Government can well afford to adopt a plan of carrying the fundamental geodetic control to a rapid completion, as only about $1,250,000 is needed to finish the geodetic work here contemplated. If this work could be done at all by the several 'States, the field and office work and the overhead charges would no doubt cost several times this amount and the great delays would make the Nation the loser by much more than the cost of the work if it were done by the Federal Government. Illustrations Nos. 9 nnd 10, "\vhich are inserted between J?ages 11 and 12, show the primnry triangulation and precise levelmg nets which are being extended by the Survey. The first one, which is the triangulation net1 shows the completed work in solid black, the. work which has been begun !n shading, and the work which sho\}ld be done in the near future m red. The other illustrntion, No. 10, shows the precise level net, with the work completed in heavy black lines, ~md the proposed workin red. The work shown on these illustrations should be carried to a rapid completion while the primary control' in the intermediate areas и should be extended ~s the work is specifically culled for. Considerin~ this important phase of the work of this Bureau, the necessity of naving precise levels and primary triangulation extended along the prmcipal rivers in Alaslm is most important. This Territory is rapidly developin~ and it is certain that if primary triangulation and precise levelmg can be carried into the interior nheud of the detailed surveys, much money will be saved in consequence. In addition to the trian~ulation and leveling in the interiorи of Alaska there is needed a tnan,gulation ncross the Alnska Peninsula connecting Cook Inlet and Bristol Buy. There are several datums now in Alaska and it is desirable to have the detached schemes of triangulation connected and alJ the work placed on one datum. In this connectio~ it is recommended that a primary triangulation be carried from Dixon Entrance northward to \Vhite Pnss at the hend of Lynn Canul, Alaska, and also that the triangulation of Puget Sound and other waters between Point Roberts and Tacoma be strengthened. These two pieces of work are portions of an arc of primary triangulation иwhich will connect Alnska with the United States. The Canadian Government is now undertaking a primary triangulation to extend from Dixon Entrance southward to Point Roberts. If the United States will extend the triangulation to White Pass, as mentioned above, it is expected that the Canadian Geodetic Survey will then carry the trianguJntion from that point down the Yukon River to a connection with the one hundred and forty-first meridian triangulation in the vicinity of Eagle City. The иdesirability of having all of the triangulation of North America on the North American datum is apparent to all who have to use the results of triangulation in surveys and mups. For the purpose of carrying on the triangulation and leveling in the interior of Alaska, there should be apr.ropriated, specifically for this object, at least $20,000 per annum until the work is completed. The item of the appropriation bill, "Party expenses, Pacific coast," should be sufficiently large to permit of $10,000 being used on the triangulation along the coast between Dixon Entrance a.nd White

There is also needed triangulation revision along the Atlantic coast of the United States and a slight amount on the Gulf coast. This is needed for two reasons. In the first place, the triangulation there is very old and many of the points have been destroyed by the erosion of the shores and by the work of man. Such points as have been destroyed should, in most cases, be reestablished. In the second place, until recent years, the mark of a triangulation station was not of such a character as to insure permanency. "'When a concrete mark is used without some tablet or lettering designating the purpose, it is very apt to be destroyed by thoughtless persons who imaiPne that it is a mark for buried treasure. Many of our important stations have been lost :for this reason. At present, practically all of the stations of the Survey are being marked by an inscribed metal disk set into the concrete or solid rock which allays any curiosity the visitor may have in regard to the purpose of the mark. иwherever old stations can be found along the coasts they should be re-marked in a substantial manner and one of the tablets should be set in the concrete or rock. About $7,500, as a minimum, should be available each year for a rather indefinite time for the revision of trian~u1ation on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This fund should be provided for in the item of the appropriation bill entitled "Party expenses, Atlantic coast." The fo11owing statements show the amount o:f precise leveling and primary triangulation needed in the interior of Alaska:

URGENT NEED OF INCREASE IN OFFICE FORCE.

The mass of material directly affecting our charts has so increased in recent years, with further increases in prospect, that it has not been possihJe with the present force to bar.die it so as to place it before the navigator in the shaI,Je of new charts or new editions of existing charts with the expedition that its importance demands. The impo!иW.n~~ of this information will be recognized when it is

underRtood that in addition to our own numerous detailed surveys, all the vast river and harbor improvements in tidal waters, all the lights, beacons, and buoys on our coasts, and every report o:f change in navigable waters has to be handled and shown on the chart. Corrections to charts were made as follows: From blue-print surveys fornished by Corps of Engineers, United States Army, fiscal year 1910, 193; fiscal year 1915, 524. Changes in aids received from' Bureau of Lighthouses, fiscal year 1910, 1,900; fiscal year 1915, 2,500. иwith reference to our own surveys 1 the additional work in the office necessary to complete them is indicated by the fact that during the fiscnl year 1915 over two and one-half times the work was spent on their completion :is compared with that consumed in 1910. In addition to takmg care of new information, the scheme of making new charts on 1-80,000 scale on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and the 1-200,000 scale on the Pacific coast should be prosecuted us rapidly as possible; also the charts of southeast Alaska need reconstructing, as they are based on unadjusted data and their defects are becoming more and more apparent with the establishment of new aids to navigation and new examinations made with the wire drug. The fact that in 1911 there were made a totnl of 207 ,568 impressions, and in 1915 a total of 304,799, in connection with the printing of the charts, or a net increase of nearly 50 per cent, furnishes another argument for 3: substa!ltial increase in onr office fo:ce. During the past vear and m prev10us years many of the men m the office connected with the various div!sions worked overtime. The inadequa.t~ force in the drawing section иand printing office of the chart div1s10n, and the computing division, and the insufficient number of clerks and. messengers are seriously retarding the progress of the work and makmg it difficult at times to get out necessary work with any degree of promptness. In fact, it has become almost an accustomed condition to have work accumulate owing to the lack of assistance in getting)t out. The recommendat10n for a further increase in the drawing section is owing to the fact that the present staff is insufficient to handle the chart material received from a.ll sources. The number of employees should be increased adequately to meet the demands, so that charts e:ontaining the latest information may be issued at the earliest possible moment. There is uraent need of the addition of several computers for the computing, tidal, and terrestrial magnetism divisions. The necessity for th~s increase in ~he computing f~rce is to enable those divisions to expedite the reduct10n and publicat10n of the results of the Survey's <иperations, and make them available for the use of the public as soon as possible. The present force can do little more than keep up with the current needs of the Survey itself, and can do little toward putting new results in final form for publication. The computation and adjustment of precise levels and the gravity and astronomic observations are practically up to date, but there are at present in the archives data for about 16,000 triangulation stations ready to be computed, the results of which should be published for the public use. These stations are located along the coasts and in the interior of the United States, Alaska, Porto Rico, and Hawaii. They have controlled the original coast surveys and can be used for

~eneral public surv~ys for an indefinitely long time if data concernmg them are published and thus made available. These stations were established at an average cost of about $65 each, and it would certainly be good business to make the computations and publish the results at a cost of only about $9 per station. The same thing is true of the tidal and current observations, many hundreds of volumes of :which are available and awaiting increased force for their discussion and utilization. It is also apparent that placing the results in print is an insurance against loss by fire. At present such a loss would be complete and incalculable. The clerical service in the Bureau is conspicuously inadequate. For example, the Superintendent has no clerk or stenographer. In a number of the div'is10ns it is found that work has so accumulated, owing to the :fact that there is not sufficient assistance in the wuy of stenographers, that it seriously disturbs the efficiency. и For a number of months it has been necessary for the Superintendent to appeal to the Department for help in order to partially catch up with the work. There is no :fact which shows more conclusively the need of more office assistance than the inability to keep up with the general routine, even with much overtime work now performed. Tliere is urgent need of additional force in the printing section. At the present time most of the men who carry on this work are not paid standard salaries in accordance with those paid for similar work in some other departments of the Government and in commercial houses. 'Vith the great increase in the output of charts, the force in the printing section has not increased proportionately, and one of the main reasons for back orders is the fact that facilities are not adequate for turning out the work.

The messenger service is inadequate, largely owing to the fact that the buildings are unsuited to the Bureau's functions. The necessity of a messenger having to take so many steps in order to perform an errand would not exist in a modern office building. Nevertheless, such is the condition, and until it is remedied several иadditional messengers are necessary.

BETTER FACILITIES FOR PRINTING CHARTS.

By far the larger purt of the results of our surveys reaches the navigator and engineer in the form of charts. Every effort should be made to have this final product of an excellence commensumte with the large amount of time and money spent in collecting and arranging the material the chart shows in a condensed form. The final stage in producing the chart is its printing, and the best press adapted to the work should be employed in order to maintain this branch of the work at the hi!?hest standard, and a sufficient number should be provided to render it possible to meet urgent demands promptly. Each copy of a chart is run through the press from two to five times, the average being three times. First, for the black plate; second, the buoy _Plate, by which the buoys are colored; third, the tint plate, by which the land areas are distinctly defined from the water areas; and on certain charts blue and yellow tints are also used. It is most important for the distinctness of the chart that the colors on the different plate~ should register or fit exactly in their assigned places. How close this register must be will be understood when it is stated that the outline of the symbol which re:presents a buoy is only one-twentieth of an inch in width. Within this outline the red color must fit. Faulty register is produced by the expansion or contraction of the chart paper during the intervals between the printings of the three plates. To obviate this lack of register and to assure the same conditions for the three runs, the second and third runs should follow the first as closely as possible, all three being completed in one day. With 11 single press this rapid sequence in printing is impracticable, due to the amount of unproductive work it involves. This consists in the necessary cleaning up of the press after the run of the black plate to prepare it for the red buoy color, and a second clean-up after the run of the buoy plate to prepare the press for the tint color. Each of these clean-ups consumes at least an hour's time of additional unproductive work from this source alone. It therefore becomes necessarv to run a m'lmber of different charts through the press for one color before it is changed for another color. Our press is the flat-bed tvpe, which is being rapidly replaced by the rotarv offset press in all in~e commercial lithographic establishments. The Hydrographicи Otnce, United States Navy, has two of the latest type one-color offset presses which have proved highly satisfactory . . . A two-color offset press has now been perfected which can be run with the same force as a single-color press. By means of this type of press the two most important impressions, the black base and the buoy color, could be done at one printing. The offset press prese:r;i.ts three distinct ad,~antag~s for our chart work. First, sharper prmts; second! the rapid drymg character of the ink used permits the printing of the var10us colors in rapid succession; third, a reduction in the cost of paper, by omitting the highsurface finish of the paper required by the present press.

20

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

It is ther~fore recommended that Congress be usked for one of these modern two-color offset presses.
HEATING AND LIGHTING THE BUILDINGS.

The question of lighting and heating the buildings occupied by this Bureau is of more serious importance than ever befo1иe. At the present time they are heated by two antiquated low-pressure boilers, which must either be replaced by t'vo new boilers, at an estimated cost of $2,000, or they must be again ineffectually repaired, at nn estimated expense of $1,000. In addition to this, there is expended for coal $1.400 per annum in order to heat the Richards Building, and the Treasury Department expends about $1,000 per annum for coal to heat the Butler Building, two-thirds of which is occupied by this Bureau. In addition to the cost for fuel, the care of the boilers entails a considerable burden during six months of the year. The facilities for handling the coal are most incomиenient, the coal bein~ dumped from the trucks into bins under the parking at the front of the building and then taken in wheelbarrows, in small quantities, to the boilers, which are located almost at the rear of the buildings. This coal must be wheeled in the open, over n tortuous route, where the handler is <'Xposed to the inclemencies of the weather throughout the winter. The coal can not be stored in the immediate vicinity of the boilers because there is not adequate storage room. At present a branch line from the heating main of the central power and heating plant, from which heat is supplied to the buildings under the supervision of the Superintendent of the Capitol Grounds, runs directly through the buildings occupied by this Bureau. It is a we1l-recognized elementary principle among those who have examined the question that economy is effected in heating buildings from a large central plant, rather than from many small plants in various buildings. It is therefore recommended that authority be requested from Congress to tap this heating main that runs through the Snrvey's buildings, for the purpose of supplying them with heat, which will allow the fnel-wusting and uneconomical boilers now in use to be discarded and the room they occupy to be; utilized for other purposes. If this permission is given, the annual saving to the Government would be $2,460, in addition to the time and labor required for the care and supervision of the present boilers. This involves the work of three laborers from approximately the first of September to the last of April, the clerical help employed in their supervision, the purchase of coal, disposal of ashes, etc. In addition to this, there would be saved considerable annoyance from smoke and ashes, and by no means of least importance, the danger from fire would be lessened. Regarding the lighting of these buildings and the furnishing of electric current needed, when the present incumbent assumed the Superintendency of this Bureau he learned that a portion of the electric current was being furnished from the Capitol Building, a practice which was started at the time. of the Spanish \Var, and before the power plant was erected. In addition to approving the continuance of this practice, it is recommended that Congress authorize us to run a wire across the street to connect with a current of

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

21

sufficient voltage to supply the necessary power at a cost very much lower than that charged by the Potomac Power Co. In view of the foregoing~ and the fact that this Bureau is located и adjacent to this excellent Government service, which can supply the electric current and heat needed by the Suney at a triflmg cost. scarcely appreciable, and in view of the fact that there is consumed $2,400 worth of coal per annum in heating the two buildings, to say nothing of the cost of current, and for other reasons already mentioned, it would seem a wise and economical morn if the foregoing request could be carried into effect.
TRANSFER OF NAUTICAL EXPERTS TO STATUTORY POSITIONS.

It is recommended that the coast pilot section be reorganized to the extent of tmnsferring its members from their present designations of nautical experts to those of assistants, of equal grade. This will necessitate an increase in the number of assistants, and a corresponding decrease in the appropriations for offshore soundings, the item from which the salaries are now paid. The change will add to the efliciency of the Surrny by rendering the high ability of the nautical experts available for all branches of the work, instead of to the strictly coast-pilot work, which is now the case. These officers are the equals of assistants in the survey in education, efficiency, and results accomplished, and should be placed on an equality with them in the items of assignments and ad rnncement. Additional reasons advanced for the necessity of this change are homogeneity in the field force of the Survey and the assurance of an ample force to druw from at all times to do coast-pilot work. Further, it gives an opportunity to the younger members of the field force, assigned to the coast-pilot work, to know better the needs of the navigator and the requirements of hydrography as well us other brunches of our work. It will eliminate these lump-sum salaries, which are not in harmony with the present policy of Congress.
INTERCHANGEABLE FEATURE OF APPROPRIATIONS.

It is recommendedи that authority be gi,иcn in the appropriation bill for the transfer of at least 10 per cent from one specific item appropriated for field expenses to any other item appro1;1riuted under that general head. The advantages of such a provision will be readily seen from the following: First. It is necessary to submit estimates for the appropriations so long in advance that it is impossible to foresee just what work inay become imperative during the year, in addition to the systematic plan of work contemplated. ,Just now it has become necessary to suspend the regular work on Long Island Sound to take up a piece ?f work on the Maryland coast, which might hnYe been done by an Independent party if the necessary expenses could have been met by a transfer from other appropriations. The necessity for special, unanticipated surveys frequently comes up, and must be met at a loss to the Survey by suspending work in progress.

22

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Second. Any piece of work is liable to cost more than anticipated and will need to be left incomplete unless there is a way to meet the increased expense; this condition occurs near the end of the fiscal year, after all available funds have been allotted. It would generallyи be possible to meet such emergencies if a transfer from one or more other items of the appropriation was authorized. Third. The appropriation can net be used to the best advantage because there is always an uncertainty in the exact cost, and consequently a margin of safety must always be maintained in each item of the ap~ropriation. The expenditures are made by widely scattered parties, often in remote regions such as Alaska and the Philippine Islands, and maintaining. a margin of safety frequently means a considerable halance.
SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL GEODETIC ASSOCIATION.

The question of our remaining a member of the permanent commission of the International Geodetic Association is a serious one. Not that there is any question whether we should be represented, but we have entered into what is in effect a treaty with foreign countries with reference to our membership in this association. Congress for the last two years has failed to appropriate funds for the continuation of this country in the International Geodetic Association, but that does not relieve us from responsibilities. This failure to meet our obligations does not sever our connection with that association. It is believed that the officers of the association do not feel or take the position, because of our not paying our contribution in 1914 and 1915, due to the negative action of Congress, that this is the settled policy of the nation; and this assumption on the part of its officers 1s shown by the fact that although the United States did not contribute its portion to the expenses of the association for the year 1914, nevertheless the permanent secretary of the association invited the American representative to vote on the question of whether or not the association should continue the convention for another 10-year period, and whether or not there should be any alteration in this convention which will expire December 31, 1916. In other words, this country's representative was considered to be a member of the permanent comnussion of this association, in good standing, though the contribution was still unpaid. . The :following- letter from the Secretary of State was the authority on which Dr. T1ttmann based his reply to the permanent secretary:

It is shown by the foregoing correspondence and the following letter that the United States has entered into an agreement with other nations, and that we have obligated ourselves to pay the amount due for the last two years, for which no money has been appropriated by Congress. The following letter shows that the United States agreed to continue in the International Geodetic Association for a period of 10 years after December 31, 1906:

The agreement referred to in the letter 0Б Mr. Tower will expire at the end 0Б the calendlU' yeur 1916. In view of the above it is believed that the United States is still a member of the International Geodetic Association, and this country should not only be represented by a member of the permanent commission, but sufficient funds should be made available by Congress to meet the contributions covering the past two years as well as for the next fiscal year.
ITEMS FOR URGENT DEFICIENCY BILL.

There are two matters which it is believed need consideration in the urgent deficiency bill. The question of whether the important international latitude observatory at Ukiah, Cal., should be abandoned is a serious one. The board of directors of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific,

24

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SJJRVEY.

feeling that the European war might make it necessary for the International Geodetic Association to abandon its work at the variation of latitude observatories, passed the following resolutions at the meeting on November 30, 1914:
Whereas it has come to the uttentlon of this board that the work of the Internutlonul Latitude Observatories Is threatened by the present war In Europe, und thut some of the stations may be closed: Be It Resolved. 'l'hnt It is the sense of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific that the work of these stntions Is of the greatest Importance, and that every effort shoul<l be made to continue the stations In this country even though others ure necessarily closed; Rcsolvc<l, That the president and secretary of this society be authorized and instructed to present the views of this society to the proper authorities of the United Stutes Government und urge upon them the deslrnblllty of making some special provision for the maintenance of the stutlons in this country.

It is recommended that the estimates for the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the year 1917 contain a provision for the expenditure of such funds as may be necessary, up to $2,500, for the maintenance of the observatory at Ukiah, Cal., if the International Geodetic Association is not able to continue this observatory in operation on account of the lack of funds or for any other reason while the European war is going on. It should be understood that after the war is over the association should resume the observations at the Ukiah observatory. The need of a clerical assistant to act in the capacity of a clerk and stenographer to the Superintendent is a matter that Is recommended for immediate consideration. At the present time the Superintendent is greatly handicapped, owing to the fact that he has to call for assistance from those who are rendering customary services to other officials in the same Bureau, and further, owing to the inadequate clerical force, the Department has been appealed tC' during the last six months, and has, at various times, supplied a stenographer. It is earnestly recommended that a clerk to the Superintendent be provided in the urgent deficiency bill.
SUBOFFICES.

The Coast and Geodetic Survey has 8uboffices at Manila, Seattle, New York, San Francisco, Galveston, Boston, and New Orleans. The Galveston office was started in May of this year, through the intere8t of the Chamber of Commerce there, which placed at the disposal of our inspector office room and a clerk, with the understanding that an effort would be made to secure the necessary funds next year to maintain this office. The Boston and New Orleans offices are conducted in cooperation with the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce and are in the charge of officers of that Bureau, who have files of our publications and charts for the information of those interested who may call to consult them. The suboffices at San Francisco, New York, and Galveston have only one officer of the Survey at each. The Seattle suboffice is useful to the "\V ushington office in securin_g information and otherwise assisting in currying on the routine business in connection with the sul'\'eys of Oregon, "\Vashington, and Alaska. It becomes more evident each year, with the increase of commercial activities along the coast of Alaska, that this suboffice

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

25

can not give adequate attention to such a large territory. Therc:fore the need of a suboffice at a suitable point in Alaska, such as Juneau, is worthy of consideration. On the Atlantic coast, in addition to the suboffices now established, a suboffice at Norfolk would be helpful, and its establishment is worth while considering. These offices arc proving very useful to the maritime public and others in their localities by enabling them to obtain information immediately and 'directly. Owing to the lack of funds, these offices are restricted in their activities almost exclusively to office routine. Funds arc needed to provide each of these offices with a clerk in addition to the officer in charge, so that the clerk would keep the office open and enable the oflicer in charge to inspect the coasts in his district and make reports to the vVashington office of any errors in the <~xisting charts, the need for revision surveys, and any information of benefit to the maritime public and of use in keeping our charts revised up to date. It would be of invaluable assistance to this Bureau in keeping its charts up to date if the coasts could be divided up into inspection districts (like those of the Lighthouse Bureau and Coast Guard) with an officer comиeniently located in each whose duty it would be to constantly inspect the coasts in his district and report to the Washington office, with recommendations, any errors, changes, etc., affecting the accuracy of the charts.
PROPOSED PURCHASE OF DUTCH HARBOR, ALEUTIAN ISLANDS,
ALASKA, AS A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BASE.
.

A problem confronts the Government in reference to a supply base in western Alaska for coal, oil, and other ship supplies. At the present time Unalaska is the headquarters of the Coast Guard cutters, and acts as a supply base for Government vessels; but the arrangement is not ideal for several reasons. First, the harbor is a poor one. The only means of reaching the wharf is through <t very narrow and crooked channel, which is dangerous to u vessel of even ordinary size. Second, at this place the Federal Government has paid nrnny thousands of dollars to a private company :for coal transported from Australia, Canada, and the United States, besides incurring other annual expenses in payment of various privileges received. As it is necessary for Government vessels to dock at a private wharf and to accept courtesies in connection therewith, it thereby places them more or less under obligation to a private concern. Third, there is a very poor fresh-water supply at Unalaska and the buildings nre inadcqnato. In view of the fact that commerce has greatly increased in this section of Alaska, it is quite necessary and nat\1rnl to look for a permanent supply base. Upon investigation it would seem that Dutch Harbor, the abandoned village nn<l home of the North American Commercial Co., is the logical place for the Federal Government to own. The only wireless station in this section is located close to this deserted village, making it easy of communication; the harbor is excellent, there being ample room for sufficient wharves, and there is a liberal fresh-water supply. The buildings of this company are in more than a fair state of preservation, and besides the good buildings,

' serious

26

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

there are coal yards with trackage for hauling coal, scales, derrick, and practical storage bins, already built. As has been stated, the entire village is deserted and can be acquired. as a whole. Considering all this it is suggested that it would be highly advisable for the Government to negotiate at an early date for the purchase of this settlement. The Department of Commerce would be greatly helped by having such a permanent Government station in this isolated section of Alaska as many of its bureaus would be benefited: This Bureau is carrying on important work in that region at the present time, and the natural anticipations arc that it will do much more each year. It is necessary for the vessels to have a place 'vhere they may readily and cheaply secure their coal and other fuel, whichи has not been the case heretofore; and in addition to this the new vessels of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, which will do much work in this territory, will be oil burners and could be supplied with fuel from Government tanks, and not from those of a privately owned company. The Bureau of Fisheries, with its great interests, is custodian of the Pribolof Islands; and the fact that its vessels will ply back and forth from these islands to eastern Alaska, as well as to Seattle, will make this point a valuable one from which to replenish her fuel and other supplies. The Lighthouse Bureau will also be greatly benefited because of its tenders being in that region at intervals while carrying on their specific work. Another consideration (and one of the most important features) is that the Coast Guard, which has made its headquarters at Unalaska in the past and which has for some time earnestly recommended the purchase of this property, will feel the benefits to a great extent. Thus, it is not only to the Commerce Department that benefit would accrue. The G░'иernment would immediately feel the beneficial results of this purchase. There ure thousands of tons of fuel used by all the Government vessels in that section, which, at present, are purchased from private concerns at large figures; 'vhile if the Government owned its own supply base, this same fuel could be furnished from Government bins and tanks, brought there from Government-owned mines and oil wells on Government vessels and colliers. In this way the cost of the purchase of this property would soon be realized in the saving on these supplies. It is earnestly hoped that the coming Congress will act favorably on this recommendation.
RETIREMENT. .

The question of retirement for civil service employees has been very justly receiving consideration from all branches of the United States Government. It seems appropriate to invite attention to the subject at this time. //In this Bureau a number of men resign each year and the gravity of these resignations and their effect on the work of the Bureau can not be overestimated. Young men come into the service, remain a few years, and then, just when they have reached a high standard of

efficiency and have gained familiarity with the details of the highly technical work, they, or many of them, for some reason resign. 'The result of these resignations is that some of its best men arc leaving the service, whose places must be filled by young and inexperienced officers whose lack of training prevents them from fulfilling the best interests of the service. The condition narrows down to the twofold question, "That is wrong with the senice under existing conditions, and what can we s11ggest to remedy the wrong? K The wrong seems to be this: The service offers a future so nnattr.active that few men, when they learn what is in store for them, have the courag-e to continue in it. The dangers and hardships endured, the sacrifices made, are out of all proportion to the rewards received. The men must devote the best years of their life to the service in all parts of the United States, Alaska, and the Philippines; must go to sea in small craft and at the risk of storms and of unknown dangers in waters which their own efforts are charting for the first time; must give up the home life which every man sooner or later desires; and must endure hardships :rnd discomforts inseparable :from the work of the service. и ~They received during the period of their greatest efficiency a moderate salary, hardly sufficient to meet present needs. Promotion is slow owing to the the comparatively large numbers in the lower grades. This is a consideration which is costing the Survey many of its best young men. They come into the service knowing little or nothing about its conditions, remain a few years, then resign and enter upon other work in which there is, perhaps, a future, a greater reward, and a more desirable mode of life. I The remedy for these conditions seems to be o. higher official standing us derived from commissions similar to those of the Public Health Service, a retirement similar to that given to officers of the Coast Guard or at least a waiting-orders status, which would insure one of a small competency in old age when unfit for field duty. It is believed that the men of this service are entitled to such consideration. ~ In efficiency the men in this Bureau are second to none in the Federal GoYernment; the work is cited as the standard of accuracy among other scientific institutions in this country and abroad. '(In view of the hardships endured and the dangers encountered, proper retirement is justified fully as much to these officers as to those to whom it has alreo.dy been given. Yet, at present, any officer injured in line of duty receives one month of sick leave nnd is then dismissed. I( If a comparison be permitted between services dissimilllr in character, it would appear that the value of the work done by these officers in promoting commerce and safe navigation is not inferior to that rendered by the Army or Navy in upholdin~ our national interests; ~ the Public Health Service in safeguarcting health; or by the oust Guard in saving life and property~

The inspector has supervision over the work of parties on the surveying vessels and other hydrogruphic and topographic work, including coast-pilot work in the field and office, and is charged with rnrious duties relating to the repair and equipment of the vessels of the Survey.
VESSELS AND l'Ainn;s, ATLANTIC COAST.

The steamer Bache was employed during the greater part of the year on offshore hydrography on a part of the coast of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. A number of tall signals were erected on shore for use in this work, and special hydrographic signals, constructed on buoys supplied and placed by the Lighthouse Service, were used in locating lines from which the shore signals could not be seen. Extensive repairs were made to the Bache during December, .January, and Febrnary. The steamer Endeavor was continued on the hydrogruphic resurvey of a part of Delaware Buy entrance until October 2. Shortly afterwards she was inspected by the local steamboat inspectors and u board of survey examined the vessel on November 9; as a result of their reports she was condemned and ordered to be sold. On May 12 the Endeavor was sold to the highest bidder for $1,015. The steamer llydrographer was employed on hydrographic surveys in Long Island Sound between Execution Rocks and Norwalk Islands, including Oyster Bay. Many uncharted shoal spots and rocky patches dangerous to navigation were discovered. A search was made for reported shoals in Pollock Rip Slue. No shoals were discovered, but some of the aids to navigation were found to be out of position. Afterwards the llydro,qraphe1и was engaged on a general resurvey of Albemarle Sound, N. C., and a hydrogruphic resurvey in the vicinity of Sandy Hook, N. ,J. The steamer I sis, then at Tompkinsville, N. Y., was chartered for the use of the Survey on May 2, m order that she might be prepared for surveying work as soon as practicable after July 1, when the appropriation for her purchase by the Government became available. On May 17 the I sis was in the reviewing line at the naval parade and on the 19th she sailed for Washington, D. C., arriving on the morning of the 21st. From that date to June 30 the steamer made several trips down the river and bay, and the remainder of the time she was at the 'Vashington Navy Yard, where plans were made for necessary alterations to fit her for surveying work.

The schooner 111atchless completed revision work in places on the cast shore of Chesapeake Bay, and after undergoing repairs at Baltimore began tL general revision of the snrveys of Albemarle and Croatan Sounds, N. C. The work in the western end of Albemarle Sound was completed early in May and that in Croatan Sound was begun. Two wire-drag parties were employed on the Atlantic coast; one in the aproaches to Portland Harbor, Me.; in Buzzards Bny, Mnss., in the southern approach to the Cape Cod Canal; in Narragansett Bay, R I.; in the vicinity of Key West, Fla.; and in the approaches to Boston Harbor, Mass. The other wire-drng party was employed in Buzzards Bay, Mass., and in Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays southward from Minots Ledge. A large number of uncharted rocks and shoals ham been fonnd by the wire-drng parties in the regions examined. 8ome improvements haw been made in the apparatns and methods used in dmg work. A publication has been prepared descriptive of the wire-drag work on the Atlantic coast, and a new form has been devised by which the unit cost of drag work in various localities can be accurately determined. Chart revisionи work was completed in the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers, N. J., and a resurvey of Arthur Kill was begun. A revision survey was made of Great Sonth Bay, Long Island, including triangulation, topography, and hydrography. A topo~p:aphic and hydrograpl.1ic survey of Jamaica Bay was con~phиted. S1gnuls for hydrogmph1c work were Prected between Sea Gut and Little Egg Inlet, N. J. The water front of Philadelphia was revised. In August, September, nnd October, H>14, a revision wns made at Salem, Mnss., of the topographic <lrtl1ils on chart ~44. Triangulation points were recovered and re-marked and the positions of prominent objects useful as aids to nn Yigation were determined. l'he series of current und tidal observations in the Potomac River, undertaken at the request of the Public Health Service with a view to determining the amonnt of pollution by sewage, etc., was completed in the latter part of the fiscal year. At the request of the Commissioner of Fisheries of the State of Virginia, a survey was made to determine the position of the lowwater mark on the west side of Parramore Island, Va. Suboffices of the Survey were established at Boston and New Orleans, through the cooperation of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce. For the convenience of the public, a stock of charts and other publications of the Survey are kept for sale at the suboffices and on certain vessels of the Survey, Bureau of Lighthouses, and Bureau of Fisheries. Field revision for new editions of the Atlantic Coast 11 ilot volumes Was made of Chesapeake Bay, of the inlnnd waters on the coast of New ._Tersey, of Delaware Bay and River, the Gulf of Mexico from Rey 'Vest to the Rio Grande~ from Point Judith to New York and up the Hudson RiYcr, the inside-route alona- the south shore of Long Island, and of the approaches to the Cape Cod Canal.

VEBS!c"LB AND PARTIES, PACIFIC COA.RT.

The steamer Ewplorer completed the survey of Knik Arm, Cook Inlet, Alaska, and its approaches. Special hydrographic work was done off the mouth of 'Voodrow Creek, at the request of the Alaskan Engirieering Commission. After completing the survey of Knik Arm, an examination was made of a reported shoal area in Seldovia Bay. The Ewplorer then took up supplemental hydrogruphy in the open area of Prince 'Villiam Sound north of Montague Island and between Hinchinbrook and Smith Islands, between Perry and Lone Islands, and on the bar bet,rnen Culross and Esther Islands. At Juneau the automatic tide gauge was overhauled and an examination was made of the edge of the shoal flat off the mouth of Sheep Creek. In March and April wire-drag work was done in Richs Passage, Wash. Work was begun at the entrance of Cook Inlet, Alaska, on June 9. The steamer Gedney \Vas engaged in combined operations in the waters west of Prince of 'Vales Island. During the season which began in April of the previous fiscal year surveys were made in Klawak Inlet, Tonowek Bay, Trocadero Bay, Meares Passage, and Sukkwan Strait. An improvised wire drag was made use of in several localities. The surveys of the main ship channels on the west side of Prince of 'Vales Island and of a safe inside channel from Tonowek Bay to Sea Otter Sound were completed, but further examination with the wire drag is needed. The steamer llfcArthwr was engaged at the beginning of the fiscal year in Nichols Passage and Felice Strait, carrying on combined operations which had been commenced in the previous April, and including triangulation, shore-line topography, and hydrography of the islands and passages. The hydrogr1tphy was earned throui:rh Nichols Passage and into the northern part of Felice Stmit.. A wire drug was used to supplement the soundings in certain localities. A search was made of a shoal reported in Portland Canal, but no evidence of it was found. In March and April the M cArth,ur was employed on revision work in Richs Passage, "\Vash. After repairs had been completed at Seattle, work was resumed. June 1, 1915, in southeast Alaska, in Felice Strait and its approach from Clarence Strait. The steamer Patterson was engaged at the beginning of the fiscal year in general surveys in the Shumagin Islands and on the 11djacent mainland of Alaska Peninsula. The triangulation was extended from the Shumagin Islands to the mainland and eastward to Kuiukta Bay, and was expanded in the Shumagin Group to furnish control for the hydrography and topography. The topography was extended in the Shumagins to include Nagai, Unga, Andronica, and Korovin Islands and the Haystacks. A topographic reconnoissance was carried along the main shore in connection with the triangulation. Two harbors were surveyed with the plane table. The hydrography covers nearly the same region as the topography. Two harbors on Nagai Island, the west coast of Popo:f and Unga Islands, and the a pp roaches to West N ugai and Gorman Straits were surveyed. Sounding lines were run between the Shumagin Islands and Unimak Pass and in the locality of the reported Lenard Rock. A bank off Cape Sarichef was developed and lines of soundings were run be-

tween Unimak Pass and Goodnews Bay. A hydrographic and topographic reconnoissance was made in connection with the triangulation from the Shumagins to Kuiukta Bay. In September and October the Patterson made a voyage of 1,700 miles to the assistance of the Coast Gnard steamer Tahoma wrecked on an uncharted reef in the western Aleutian Islands. Twenty-nine of the crew were picked up and brought back to Unalaska, the remainder of the ship's complement ha vin~ been rescued by another vessel. The courage o:f the commanding officer in venturing with the Patterson, an old and none too seaworthy vessel, to the rescue of the Tahoma's crew is worthy of the highest commendation. Only a few mont.hs later he lost his life when the steamer Lusitania was destroyed. 'Vork in the field was closed October 23. The Patterson was repaired at Seattle and resumed work in the Shumagin Islands ()n June 21. On the way a sunken rock with 15i feet o:f water in 'Vhale Passage, Alaska, was found and located. Work was in progress at the close o:f the year. The work of the steamer Talcu wns the topography and hydrogra. phy of Passage Canal and Landlocked Bay, and the triangulation o:f Landlocked and Fidalgo Bays. The hydrography covers the area between the survey of 1 n12 off Esther and Culross Islands, across the lower part of Port "Wells into Passage Canal, and up the canal to a junction with the 1910 work. Field operations were closed September 28. During the winter revision work in the vicinity of Seattle, 'Vash., was done by the chief of this party. 'Vork in Prince 'Villiam Sound was resumed in June in Ports Gravina and Fidalgo, after a new boiler had been installed and repairs made to the Talm. The work assigned to the steamer Yulcon was to develop a channel :from Kuskokwim Bay through the extensive flats to the main river. The result of the season's work was the discovery and charting of a good channel across the flats into the Kuskokwim River. Sailing directions for entering and full predictions of the time and height of high and low waters for 1915 for the river were prepared. This survey opens up an extensive region in Alaska which previously was almost inaccessible. The survey of the Kuskokwim was resumed in the latter part of .Tune, 1915. Wire-drug work in Tongass Narrows, Alaska, was begun in July, 1914. For this work a revision of the triangulation was necessary. A small scheme of triangulation was carried from :M:ary Island to Mountain Point nnd Pennock Island. The topography located new whanes at Ketchikan and corrected the shore line in Revillagigedo Channel. The drag work, to an effective depth of 45 feet, included all of ]'ongass Narrows from Guard Island to Mountain Point, Nichols Passage in the vicinity of "Walden Hocks, Port Chester 1md entrance, and Revillagigedo Chnnnel from Twin Islands to Aliwa Point, including the passage north of Bold Islnnd nnd the entrance to Thorne Arm. Field operations were closed October 10. Wire-drag work was resumed May 12, 1915, in Revillngigedo Channel and was in progress nt the close of the fiscal year. The wire-drag Work done in May and June, 1915, covers the area in the main channel between Twin Islands and Cupe Fox and the entrance to Boca de Qua.dra. A 10,000-foot drag was successfully used in the open waters.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY~

In 1914, 21 dangers were reported, 11 of which are of the first importance. In May and June, 1915, several dangerous ::.иocks were discovered and reported. A second wire-drag party for work in Alaska was organized in April, 1915, and began work on :May rn in Sumner Strait in the latitude of Bluff Island, from '"hich point by June ao drag work with an effective depth of 50 feet had been carried northward nearly to Point Baker. Drag work was done along the eastern side of the strait out to longitude 133░ 43' and including Calder Rocks, and an area on the West side southeast from Point Amelius. Triangulation and topography were done to locate signals for the drag work and to check the position of Barrier Islands. The resurvey of Yaquina Bay, Oreg., including triangulation, topography, and hydrography, which was in progress at the l'eginni~g of the fiscal year, was completed No,иember 7. Current observations were liegun during the yefir at San Francisco Light Vessel, Blunts Heef Light Vessel, Columbia Ui\иcr Light Vessel, Umatilla Reef Light Vessel, and Swiftsurc Bank Light Vessel.
INSl'I>:CTION llUTY.

An officer has continued on duty as inspector for the coasts of California and in charge of the suboflice at the San Francisco customhouse. Another ofliccr has continued on duty as inspector for the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and .Alaska and 1n charge of the suboffice of the Survey 'in the Burke Building at Seattle, 'Vash. He has also been charged with the supenision of the repairs to the vessels of the Surrny at Seattle, and with various details of field work. 'l'hree oflicers of tlie Survey have been assigned at different times to duty as Assistant Inspector of llydrography and Topography. Among the duties performed by these oflicers arc the preparation of estimates for future work, the inspection of ,иcssels requiring repairs, and the purchase and preparation of plans for the construction of new vessels. и
HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.

In the Hawaiian Islands the reYision of the triangulation nnd topography of the island of Hawaii was resumed in August near Punaluu Harbor and carried northeastward along the coast line to Cape Kunukaki and thence northwestward to Hilo Bay, thus completing the survey of the island on December 31. Numerous points were determined for use in hydrography. Hevision work on the island of Molokai was begun in March and continued until May 31, when work was suspended owing to the exhaustion of the appropriation. The topogrnphy was carried from Cape Hawala around the south and west sides of the island nearly to Kalaeokailio.
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

The work of the Survey in the Philippine Islands is executed under the direction of the director of surveys, an officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, who, acting under authority from the Super-

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

33

intendent, makes plans :for the work, issues detailed instructions to the field parties, and also has charge of the suboflice at Manila. The expenses of the work are met partly from the appropriation for tbe Coast and Geodetic Survey and partly from funds provided by the Philippine Government, which also furnishes :four vessels for surveying purposes. One st~amer, the Pathfinde1и, is furnished by the Coast and Geodetic Surve'y. The five vessels of the Survey have been kept in the field as continuously as possible, the principal cause for delay being the necessity for rather extensive repairs. . In the matter of general expenses the increased cost of coal is addIng very materially to the expense of the work. This is especially true in the case of the steamers M arinduque and RomJJlon, :for tl;e reason that the region in which they are employed, the coast of the Calamian Group and of Palawan Island lies apart from the mo1\'l frequented routes of travel and commerce, in consequence of which the price of coal at ports in that region is much higher than in tl).e principal commercial ports of the archipelago. The same extra expense applies in a great measure to the steamer Fatlwmer, as th:tt vessel has frequent occasion to coal at Port Uson, in the Calamian Group, and consumes much more coal than the ilf arinduque or the Romblon. The steamer Pathfonder was engaged in work as follows: A survey Was made on the south coast of :Mindanao from Parang across the delta of the Mindanao River and southwa'rd to Port Lebak. ~\. junction was completed on the east coast of Mindanao, near Hinatuan, between the surveys J)reviously exec\1ted on that coast. A special examination was ma e of certain parts of the Sulu Sea, including Moyune Shoal and vicinity. A survey was made of a reported shoal on the east coast of N egros. A revision was made of the surveys of the coast south of Manila Bay entrnnce. A special survey was made of Palmas Island. A hydrogruphic examination Was made in vicinity of San Bernardino Island. The steamer Fatlwmer was employed chiefly in the development of the region around the Cuyo and the Calamian Groups of islands. A special examination was made of a part of Iloilo Strait in which a sunken rock had been reported, and a large-scale topographic survey of the city of Iloilo was made at the request of the secretary of com~erce and police in connection with projected harbor and municipal improvements . . The principal work of this vessel has been the hydrogrnphy of the important passages between Mindoro, the Semirara Islands, Panay, and the Quinaluban and Cuyo Groups. This work was nearly completed. The steamer llfarinduque was chiefly engaged in suryeys on the eastern coast of Palawan in the vicinity of Dumaran Island. The main triangulation scheme of Palawan 'vas extended to the vicinity of latitude 10░ north. Some shoal spots in Coron Buy, Calamian Group, were developed. The hydrogmphy of unfinished areas cast of Coron Island and in the eastern approach to Coron Passage was completed and surveys northward of Dinaran Island were begun. The steamer Romblon was engnged in detailed topo~mphic and hYdrographic surveys of the numerous islands and their surround106840-15--3

ing waters lying between the northeastern coast o:f Palawan and the Calamian Group. The filling o:f gaps in the work o:f the 11/arinduque west and southwest of Dumuran Island and o:f a large gap inclurling Taytay Bay and the region eastward o:f that bay between work preYiously done by the Afarinduque and Romhlon, respectively, was assigned to this vessel. The suney o:f Taytay Bay was well adи vanced by the close of the fiscal year. The steamer Research was engaged in general surveys of Ticao and Masbate Passes, including a base line near Bulan; triangulation, topography, and hydrography o:f southern Luzon, and Ticao and Masba te Islands; surveys of the region around Ticao Island, Sorsogon Province, including subordinate triangulation between Burias Island and Luzon; topography at the entrance to Sorsogon Bay and westward nearly to Donsol; along the west~rn shore of Ticao Island; and along the northeastern shore of Masbate Island from Black Rock Puss to Masbate Harbor; and hydrography in the passages between Luzon, Ticao, Bnrias, and Masbate, including large-scale surveys of Masbate and San Miguel Harbors. At the end o:f the fiscal year work was in progress between Masbate Harbor and Port Barrera.
NEW VESSEl.S 1'0R THE SUl!VEY.

As a result of representations made to Congress at its last session by the President and by the Secretary of Commerce as to the urgent needs of the Suney, an appropriation of $289,000 was made, available July 1, 1915, for two new Yessels to replace others worn out in the service and not worth further repairs. After extensiYe inquiry and an inspection of many vessels offered for sale, a contract was made by the department on April 26 for the purchase of the steamer Is1'.s for a sum slightly less than $60,000. The ''essel was chartered by the Survey until the appropriation should become available on July 1. The lsi-s wns built in 1902 at a cost of about $225,000 and could not be duplicated for that price at the present time. She is in almost perfect condition in every respect, having been very carefully used, and she is given a very high rating by the American Bureau of Shipping nnd by the SteamboatInspection Service. The Isis is a twin-screw vessel of steel construction, has a double bottom, and wns built in 1902. Her length is 180.4 feet, beam 24.8 :feet, draft 11.6 feet, depth 13.5 feet, gross tonnage 377, and net tonnage 256. She has twin triple-expansion engines o:f 2,000 horsepower and double boilers. Her cruisinЦ speed on natural draft is 12 knots. Under forced draft she makes from 15 to 17 knots. Her coal consumption at 12 knots is only 9 to 10 tons in 24 hours. In surveying service it is estimated that she will a,иerage about 6 tons per day. The price paid for the vessel included the cost of inspection and classification, cleaning and painting bottom, and other work necessary for putting her in commission. Immediately after the signing of the contract preparations were begun for manning and eqmpping the vessel. She was given a position of honor in the review of the North Atlantic Fleet held in New York Harbor May 17. The JJ/ ayfiower, carrying the President, was first in line, next came the Dolphin with the Secretary of the Navy

and guests, and then the lsU3 with the Secretary o:f Commerce and other officials. The I sis will be employed on offshore hydrographic work along the Atlantic coast. She replaces the old steamer Endeavor which Was built during the Civil Wur. Plans were prepared :for a new vessel, authorized in the appropriation act approved March 3, 1915, to be specially fitted and equipped :for the exposed offshore work on the coasts of California, Oregon, Washington, western Alaska, und the Aleutian Islands.

In October the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Patterson, in response to an urgent call by wireless, made a voyage of 1,600 miles to the assistance of the officers and crew of the Coast Guard steamer Tahoma wrecked on a reef in the western Aleutian Islands. Three boats' crews of the Takoma were picked up on Attu Island and taken to Unalaska by the Patterson, the remainder having been rescued by other vessels. In recognition of the service rendered, the members of the party onи the Patterson were presented with handsome testimonials by the officers and crew of the 1'ahoma. The unfortunate loss of this vessel is one of many disasters which иemphasize the urgent need of means for the more rapid prosecution of detailed surveys in this dangerous region. On July 25 assistance was rendered by the steamer Endeavor, J. B. Boutelle, commanding, to the lighthouse steamer Iris, with the Secretary of Commerce and other officials on board, which had gone aground during a sudden storm at Lewes, Del. On February 28 the officers und crew of the Survey schooner II!atchless rendered efficient help in putting out a fire in Edenton, N.C. At midnight on Saturday June 12 the steamer Gednm;, F. H. Hardy, commanding, rendered assistance to the fishing иschooner Poloris by hauling her off Klawak Reef, north end of Fish Egg Island, Alaska, on which she had run aground.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

On the night of .July 22 the Explorer rendered assistance to tho steamer Bertlia, which was anchored at Ship Creek for use as a floating wharf. In u fresh wind and heavy current the Bertha began to drag, and was being curried in toward the beach. Members of the crew of the Explore1и aided the crew of the Bertha in getting up their anchor, which, becmu;e of lack of steam, they were obliged to hea nи up by hand. On May 25, 1V15, in approaching San Bernardino Straits the fourmasted schooner Alpenc, of San Francisco, was sighted by the steamer Patlifinde1и off the north encl of Capul Island flying a rlistress signal. The master of the Alpenc asked the Pathfinder to stand by, as he had lost an anchor and 'Yns afraid of being beached by the strong currents. Noting that the vessel was in a helpless condition and fost drifting to the south side of the straits the Pathfinder towed the A7pene to a safe position at sea.
COAST-PILOT WOl!K.

The coast-pilot section has been engaged hoth in field and office work. The field work is mentioned under the heading " Field work, Atlantic coast." The office work includes the preparation of Coast Pilot, Part IV; the Inside Houte Pilot of New .Jersey; Coast Pilot Notes for Kuskokwim Bay and River, Alaska; supplements for six coast pilots; and correction sheets for insertion in coast pilots. The preparation of coast-pilot directions for the coast of Alaska from Yakutat Bay westward is nearly completed. Much valuable work has been done by the coast-pilot section in the examination of original sheets and furnishing data as to the condition of the suneys. A plan for obtaining, with the cooperation of the Bureau of Lighthouses, slack-water observations in the main channels at the easterly end of Long Island Sound and Cape Cod Canal, to furnish data for current tables to be included in the tide tables, was carried into effect. A general plan was prepared for current observations to be undertaken <luring the fiscal year 1916. Special information was compiled from field reports and records of surveys for the use of the Alaskan Engineering Commission. After obtaining the opinions from mariners and others interested in the charts of the Survey, the use of the foot instead of the fathom as the unit of soundings on charts of 1-80,000 and larger scales of the и Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States was recommended and adopted. Certain changes in the form and matter contained in the tide tables published by the Survey were recommended and adopted. A study 'bi1s been made of the question of steamship lanes for coastwise vessels. A number of oflicers of the Survey with experience on the coast of Alaska were assigned to the coast-pilot section for short periods during the winter and aided in the preparation of notes and sailing directions for that coast. An Inside Route Pilot of the Gulf Coast of the United States from Key 1Vest to New Orleans was compiled by an officer of the Survey detailed for that purpose and has been published.

Tidal observations were made in connection with all hydrogrnphic surveys in the United Stutes und its outlying territory, and ut reguln,r stations at Portland, Mc.; Fort Hamilton, N. Y.; Atlantic City, N. J.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Baltimore, Md.; Key West, Fernandina, St. Augustine, and Cedar Keys, Fla.; Galveston, Tex.; San Diego and San Francisco, Cul.; Seattle, иwash.; und Juneau, Alaska. Tidal indicators, exhibiting automatically the stage and height of the tide, were maintained at Fort Hamilton and New York City, N. Y., and Heedy Island, Delaware Ri\"er. 'Vith the cooperation of the Bureau of Lighthouses, observations of currents were made at a number of light vessels on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Similar obseiTations were mude when practicable by the hydrographic parties of the Survey.
Oflи'ICE 01" INSPECTOR 01" GEODETIC WORK.

'The duties of inspector are performed at the Coast and Geodetic Survey oflice and in the field. They consist mainly in planning field work, preparing the neces~mry instructions for field parties in geodetic work, and correspondence relating to dctnils of field operations; examination of records, computations, and reports; scientific investigations based on the results of the field observations, and computations in the computing division; and preparation for publications of the results of geodetic field und office work. The inspector and members of the computing division assisted the International Boundary Commissioner by inspecting the records and computations of triangulation and the reports of field parties and aided in certain other details connected with the boundary work. The most notable events in the geodetic work during the past fiscal year were: 1. The determination of latitude at a large number of stations between central Texas and the Pacific coast and along the CaliforniaN evada boundary. The rapidity with which this work was done was due in a large measure to the use of :m autotruck for transportntion. 2. The introduction of the nutotruck ns a means of transportntion for parties engaged in reconnoissance and triangulation, which is expected to increase the amount of work accomplished and to decrease its cost. 3. The great rapidity obtained in precise leveling on the line between Butte, Mont., and Pasco, 'Vash. 4. The completion of the triangulation along the Pacific coast of the Olympic Peninsula, joining the triangulation of Grays Harbor with that of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The geodetic work done during the year is us follows:
TltIANOULATION.

The triangulation between Memphis, Tenn., and Huntsville, Ala., begun during the previous fiscal year, was completed. The length of this arc was 190 miles, and 31 stations were occupied in the muin scheme in 104 days. Thirty-eight geographic positions were determined and four primary azimuths were observed.

40

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURV░E'.Y.

The erection of signals and marking of stations on the MernphisHuntsville arc was <lone by a separate party. Signals were erected at 15 stations. The average height of the tripod on which the instrument rested was 56 feet, and the superstructure on the scaffold on which the observer and the light keeper work was on the average 83 feet in height. After this work was done a reconnoissance was made for a connection between a detached piece of primary triangulation in the vicinity of Louisville, Ky., and a line of the transcontinental arc in the vicinity of North Vernon, Ind. Signals were then erected and stntions marked for this work. In all there were one single and seven double structures and three low stands to support the instrument. The observation of angles in this triangulation were made by a separate party between October 22 and November 19, 1914. Reconnoissuncc and preparation of stations for primary triangulation to the northward of Great Salt Lake, Utah; were begun in the latter part of May, lfJ15~ and at the close of the fiscal year the work was in progress. The observation of angles on this triangulation was begun in the latter part of June and was also in progress at the close of the fiscal year. Automobile trucks were used for the transportation both of the reconnoissance and the observing parties. The work to the northward and westward of Utah is being done in response to a request rec~ivcd several years ago from the United States Geological Survey, and will extend into a large area where there is at present no geodetic control based on the North American datum. The obscrrntion of n~gles on the arc of secondary triangulation which extends from the Strait of Juan de Fuca to Grays Harbor was completed during the year. The reconnoissance for this work and the erection of the: signals had been completed during the previous summer. The length of this arc is only 110 miles and there were only 16 stations in the main scheme, but it is probable that no piece of work done on land in the Survey has required greater judgment and skill, as well as ability to face har_dships, than this. In much of the area tra \'ersed there were no trails and the heavy ~rowth of timber and brush made progress almost as difficult as it is in a tropical jungle. Owing to the character of the country, it was impracticable to clear lines throug:h the timber between stations. It was therefore necessary to elevate the instrument and the heliotropes and lamps abo,иe the timber. The lumber used for this purpose was cut in the forest in the vicinity of the stations, and in many cases trees were pulled together to make such supports. A number of the instrument stands were more than 100 feet high. One of tht>m, that at station Lu Push, was 187 feet above the ground. In one case a tree used to support the lamp and heliotrope was sawed off at a height of 213 feet above the ground. The tower in this case was a single tree, cleared of limbs. It is easily seen that the occupation of these stations at night required steady nerves and great daring. During the summer of 1!.)14 a triangulation was extended across the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, between Passage Canal, 11 branch of Prince William Sound, and Turnagain Arm, a tributary of Cook Inlet. This work was not an extensive one, but there were many difficulties to be overcome, as all of the travel of the party was on

foot and much of it was over glaciers. Progress was greatly retarded by almost continuous rains. During the winter and l'arly sprfog of 1915, 12 high signals were erected on the coast of Georgia and Florida for the use of the steamer Bache while engaged in carrying on offshore soundings. These signals were of a special type and served the needs admirably. During the progress of the signal building, beach measurements and tertiary triangulation necessary to determine the geographic positions of the signals were completed. Invar base tapes were used in the beach measurements. In the latter part of November and December a triangulation was made of St. Vincent Sound, Fla., at the request of the Bureau of Fisheries'. The scheme of triangulation was 17 miles in length and 13 stations were occupied. The new work was based upon 4 old stations which had been previously established by the Survey. During the spring of 1915 a study was made of the commercial lamps which might be used as signal lamps in triangulation. A careful study of the problem and the testing of one apparatus led to the concli1sion that no portable lamp could be found that would be more suitable than the one now in use in the Survey. It is very desirable to secure a portable lamp which will have a candlepower much higher than the lamp now in use. Further study is being made of this problem and it is possible that an electric or other kind of lamp may be designed which will meet the needs of the Survey. With a powerful light the time of occupying a station would be materially reduced. A slight haze will make the present lamps invisible иor too faint for observing over the longer lines of the triangulation.
PRECISE l.En;LING.

Between ,July 1 and November 3, precise leveling was done on a line extending from Butte, Mont., to Pasco, 'Vush., by way of Spokane, and also on a short line from Sand Point, Idaho, to the Canadian boundary. This work had been begun in the spring of the preceding fiscal year. The amount of work done on these lines during the present fi!':'cal year was 399 miles. During both July and October previous monthly records for precise leveling were surpassed. During July, 1914, 120 miles were run, while in October of the same year the progress made was 149 miles. The maximum result for one day was 20.5 miles of single line, run in 7 hours of actual leveling. In the spring of 1915 a line of precise levels was run from Seattle to Blaine, 'Vash. This work was done in order to connect at the latter place with the precise leveling bench marks of the Canadian Geodetic Survey. At the end of the fiscal year work had been begun on a line to extend from Huntley, Mont., to some point on the Great Northern Railway in the vicinity of Mondak, Mont. At the latter place a connection will be made with precise leveling bench marks established along the Great Northern Railway in 1914. At Louisville, Ky., 12 miles of leveling were run to connect triangulation station Lutz with a precise leveling bench mark on the Ohio River, and about l~ miles of leveling were run to connect triangulation station Louisville North Base with a precise leveling bench mark.

42

HEPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Between July 1 and October 21, 1914, a line of precise levels was run beh\иeen Minot, N. Dak., and Devon, Mont. The work on this line was begun in the spring of 1913. At Dernn a connection was made with the precise leveling bench marks established at that place during the previous season. In the spring of 1915 precise leveling was done along a line which will extend from Carson City to Las Vegas, Nev. This work was undertaken at the request of the United States Geological Survey for the purpose of furnishing accurate elevations within the area traversed. A number of connections will be made with detached pieces of leveling already done by the Geological Survey. This work was in progress at the end of the fiscal year. Between October 28 and November 25, 1914, precise leveling was done on a line between Perth Amboy and Sandy Hook, N. J. The line is 29.4 miles in length and it wus run for the purpose of testing . the stability of a bench mark at Sandy Hook. The work was done in response to a request from the Corps of Engineers United States Army. It was found that the bench mark which had been used as a reference point for the tide gauges for a number of years apparently had sunk 5.3 centimeters ( 0.17 foot). The total amount of precise leveling done during the fiscal year was 980 miles.
ASTRO:'>O.\llC WOllK.

Between July 1 and October lG, 1914, observations were made for the determinat10n of the astronomic latitudes of a number of points along the Texas-California arc of primary triangulation and the oblique boundary between Nevada and California. This work had been begun on May 14, 1914. During the total season 37 stations were occupied, at the rate of 7.4 stations per month. This is a very remarkable rate of progress, considering the difficult character of the country over which the party operated. It was necessary, in most cases, for the members of the party to han<lpack the instruments and observing tents and other equipment from the autotruck, which was used as a means of transportation, to the stations on the mountain tops. The weather conditions were variable, the temperature ranging from below freezing on the summits of the mountains to as much as 110░ in the shade in the valleys. An unusual rate of progress was made during the first 12 days of October, when seven stations were occupied and completed along the Nevada-California boundary. The automobile truck used by tlus party is the one which had been used the previous season for a party operating between central Colorado and Canada, approximately along the one hundred and fourth meridian. The two seasons' work with the trnck proved beyond a doubt that for certain classes of astronomic work it is much more efficient than teams. Between July 1 and October 28, 1914, a determination was made of the difference of longitude between each two of the three stations, Far Rockaway, Long Island, Nan1l Observatory, иwashington, D. C., and Cambridge, Mass. This work was done as a part of a plan to determine the difference in longitude by cable between Far Rockaway, N. Y., and Borkum, Germany. The Royal Prussian Geodetic In-

REPORT OF SUPEtnNTl!::Nt>ENT, COAST AND GEODETiC SURVEY,

43

stitute agreed to make the necessary observations at each end of the cable if the Coast and Geodetic Survey would make the observations necessary to connect Far Rockaway with at least two stations of the existing longitude net of the United States. The work of the Coast and Geodetic Suney was completed, but the European war prevented the finishing of the cable work by the obse1Ters of the Prussian Geodetic Institute. The longitude work of the Coast and Geodetic Snney obseners was done under special instructions which called for the exchange of observers for each difference of longitude, and new transits and chonogrnphs were nsed for the first time in this Survey. They had been purchased from a firm in Germany for this especial work. They prm'CCl very satisfactory and will be used in most of the future determinations' of longitude by the Snney. Upon the completion of the work mentioned above, five differences of longitude were determined between old longitude stations and triangulation stations of the Memphis-Huntsville arc and of the Louisville connection. This work was done between November 1 and January 14. During the progress of the longitude work, astronomic latitude was obsened at five stations. Azimuths were observed at five triangulation stations of the :Memphis-Huntsville arc and the triangulation connecting Louisville with the transcontinental triangulation.
GRAVITY.

During the fiscal year the determination of the intensity of gravity was made at 52 stations in the eastern part of the United States. иwestern Union Telegraph Co. noon signals were used to rate the chronometers used in this work. This method was substituted for the method by which the time observations \Vere made upon the stars by the gravity obsener. Previous to .this fis~al ye~r the gravity party consisted of two observers, a station reqmred nme days on an average, and the cost (not including the observers' salaries) was $176. Now only one obsener is needed, n station is completed in eight days, and the cost (exclusive of the salary of the observer) is about $57, less than one-third of the former cost. The former high accuracy secured in the results has been maintained since the beginning of the use of the noon signals. . The gravity work has been extended dnring the year us rnpidly as practicable on account of the great Yalue that the results will have for geologists, geophysicists, and others interested in 'rnrld physics.

mend changes in the <lesign 0Б magnetic instruments, or methods of observing to secure improved results or to save time; to supervise the planning and construction 0Б magnetic obser_vatory buildings, etc. The ~agnetic work accomplished during the year may be summarized as follows: The magnetic obsmиrntories at Cheltenham, Md.; Vieques, P. R.; Tucson, Ariz.; Honolulu, Hawaii; and Sitka, Alaska, were in operation throughout the year. The magnetographs gave continuous records except Бor occasional brief intervals 0Б a day or less. At Tucson the record 0Б the horizontal intensity variometer was lost for u few days on account of the slipping and final breaking 0Б the quartz fiber suspension. The year as a whole was comparatively free from large magnetic disturbances, but the one on June 17 was the largest recorded since 190!.l. A seismograph was kept in continuous operation at each obsenatory, the number 0Б earthquakes recorded being less than in previous years. Meteorological observations were made daily. At Tucson the results were communicated by telephone and telegraph to the 'Vcather Bureau office at Phoenix, Ariz. At Honolulu the results were furnished, us heretofore, to the Honolulu office 0Б the 'Veather Bureau an<l to the Ewa Plantation Co. All 0Б the magnetic instruments used in the field work during the year were standardized at Cheltenham. A new magnetometer 0Б the India Survey type, made for the Survey by Cooke & Sons, of York, England, which was compared at the Kew Observatory before shipment to the United States, was standardized at Cheltenham and its constants determined, thus furnishing a comparison between the Kew and Cheltenham standards. An observer of the department of terrestrial magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington took one of their combined magnetometers and earth inductors to Cheltenham and secured a careful comparison by means 0Б simultaneous observations. Instruments were standardized also for the Navy Department and the Lake Survey. In May the l'a1'negie, 0Б the above Department, calle<l at Honolulu, and an accurate comparison was made 0Б the magnetic instruments in her outfit with those at the Honolulu observatory. It became necessary during the year to consider the erection of a suitable building for office and residence purposes at Sitka, and complete plans an<l specifications for such a building were prepared under the direction of the observer. и
MAGNETIC WOUK ON LAND.

The magnetic elements, declination, dip, and horizontal intensity, were determined at 4Hi stations, 71 of whi~h were auxiliary stations observed on account 0Б local magnetic disturbance and 12 were new primary stations to replace old ones which had become unsuitable. The observations were distributed in 31 States. Eighty-one repeat stations were occupied during the year Бor the purpose of obtaining data for the determination 0Б the secular change m the magnetic elements, especially the declination~ These also are included in the total number of stations given above. The following _tabulation shows the distribution 0Б the stations occupied:

There were also 18 stations in Alaska nt which declination observations were made by parties engaged in other brn nches of the field work. The magnetic work curried on at sea by Ycssels of the Survey was as heretofore incidental to the regular woiиk and was small in amount, as the ships' routes have covered little new territory. The plan of magnetic work heretofore a<loptcd !ins bcocn continued during the year, and the preliminary survey is still in progress. At the close of the fiscal year there were still 331 counties where magnetic stations have not yet been established, and this number will be somewhat increased by the subdivision, especially in the \Vest, of large counties into two or more smaller ones. The imиestigation of local disturbance arens is being carried on in connection with the regular magnetic suncy. Sixty meridian lines were established during the year. These "иere nil established at the request of local authorities. и

Observations at Gaithersburg were closed in December, 1014. A report on the results of the observations mnde with the photographic zenith tube was prepared for publication by Dr. F. E. Ross, the obscner in charge. The obscrrntions at Fkiah arc being continued. No appropriation was made by Congress for the payment of the quota of the United States as an adhering member of the International Geodetic Association for which the United States stands pledged by a joint resolution of Congress. It is hoped tlrnt the appropriation of the necessary amount to meet this deficiency will be made. The item for travel of delegates to the meeting of the association was however inserted in the sundry civil act. On account of the European war it is probable that no meeting of the association will be held in 1916.

SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Trlungulntlon: 1 slgnnl pole erectecl, 1 8tntlon in supPlementul scheme occupied for horizontal measures. Hydrograph~и: 7G square 1n11es of nreu drugged, 222.7 miles run while dragging, ll,O:i3 ungles mensure!l, 343 Houndings mnde on unchnrtell shouls, 2 tide stations established, 5 hydrogruphic sheets finished.

"\Vire-drag work in progress on July 1 in Casco Bay and approaches to Portland, Me., was continued until September 28. A total area of 76 square miles was dragged, and 34-3 soundings were taken on Uncharted shoals. The number of soundings indicates the nature of the region, which is characterized by narrow rocky ridges running generally from northeast to southwest but without pronounced pinnacles. The urea wus laid out in sections to facilitate the removal of lobster pots which was necessary before work "иith the drag could be и uone. Considering the length of the drag used, the interference with the work from this cause was exceptionally slight. The area of the Cod Le<lges was included in the work instead of the area between the 18 and 25 fathom curves. The former area was .adly in need of a drag survey, ns \'essels of considerable draft, especially large schooners, hadи been accustomed to cross the ledges at

various points where the charts indicated ample depth. The usual double purpose 0Б a wire-drag survey, to locate the uncharted shoals and to prove the remaining area free :from shoals, was accomplished. The most notable dangers found were a 29-foot rock in Portland, u 30-foot rock in the channel off Portland Head, extensive shoal areas near "\Villard Rock, Pine Tree Ledge, and Broad Co,иe Rock; very shoal extensions 0Б Alden Rock; a shoal with general depths 0Б 2и9 to 31 feet between Bulwark Shoal and West Cod Ledge Rock, and a long ridge south of иwest Cod Ledge. The dragging of this extensive area was a difficult operation, somewhat interfered with by the necessity of keeping out of the danger zones of the heavy-gun target practice of the coast defense forts at Portland during about 20 days in the most favorable part of the season. The weather was unusually favorable for open sea work. The winds were moderate and the amount of fog below the average. lmprovements.-The automatic winder to guide the wire on the reel so that it would be uniformly wound proved a marked success and made it possible to set out the drai from the guiding launch while proceedmg at considerable speed. ln this way as much as 4,000 Бeet of drag was set out in 12 mmutes, but such speed can only be used under favorable conditions. The signaling system operated by compressed air proved a marked success, and made it possible to operate a drag of 4,000 feet or longer from the guiding launch without an additional observer on the end launch. This requires a lengthening of the tow-line base, which in turn is desirable, as it insures the drag keeping more closely to its proper depth. By properly using the various tenders in changing the drug depth, a longer drag can be used in certain areas than was formerly regarded practicable. On September 30 the party left Portland, Me., for New Bedford, Mass., via the Cape Cod Canal, arriving at the latter place the following day. The dragging of Buzzards Bay wr1s begun October 5. The work included the dragging of all areas not finished during the previous season, from a line joining the South Dumping Grounds and vVest Island to the limits of the w<?rl~ done by the party 0Б Mr. J. H. Hawley, and included som~ unfinished work in New Bedford Harbor and Quicks Hole. This work was continued until November 7. Owing to unfavorable weather the proposed work in Buzzards Bay was not entirely completed. The rriucipal shoals located in Buzzards Bay were a 16-foot shoal in Quicks Hole, a 15-foot shoal near "\Vhite Rock, and a number of shoals in the area northwest 0Б 'Voods Hole. A special effort was made to complete all unfinished areas in the middle of the bay, but some portions were necessarily left for another season. After closing work in Buzzards Bay an examination with the drag was made at Newport, R. I., of an area of broken ground between. Hose and Goat Islands, three-fourths 0Б a mile in extent. The weather during this work was most unfavorable. The area in the vicinity of a charted 17 -foot shoal was examined with unusual care and soundings were made for more than an hour by three tenders over the entire doubtful.area. No important changes were found.

[N. H. HECK.] SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Triangulntion: 84 squure miles of urea covered, 4 stations in muin scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 1 station In SUJ)plenw11tnl scheme occupied for horizontal meusurcs, 18 geographic positions determineli. Hydrogruphy: 57 square miles of urea drugged, 128 miles run while drugging, 4,783 angles measured, 151 soundings made on uncharted shoals, 1 hydrogruphic sheet, scule 1: 25,000, purtly finished.

After completing necessary preliminary arrangements, work was begun May 10, 1915, on a wire-drag survey of the approaches to the harbor of Boston, Mass. The headquarters of the party was at Hull. Three hired launches were used in this work. The weather conditions during May and June were favorable, and satisfactory progress was made. The urea drugged was of two classes, clear open water and very rocky shoal area. Ahout 42 square miles of the former were finished in May and about 15 square miles of the latter in June. Practically no shoals were found in the former, while 89 shoal spots were found in the latter. The shoal areas distinctly indicated the need of a drug survey. The hottom is of a different character from that previously dragged elsewhere, though it, somewhat resembles that at Portland, Me. The shoals, however, do not extend in well-defined ridges as at Portland. The bottom is rocky but nearly flat ornr large ureas, with sharp rocky points projecting 3 to 8 feet in places. In one section of nearly 8 square miles the lead was dropped at intervals, and only one sounding was obtained with soft bottom and this in a small pocket. All the rest were on rocky bottom. Tidal informat10n for the reduction of soundings was obtained from an automatic tide gauge maintained at Nut Island by the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Board, the records of which were kindly placed at the disposal of the surveying party. A few triangulation stations were occupied for the determination of prominent objects for use as signals. Improvements in apparatus.-The principal improvement was the adoption of stranded wire cable (S1emens-Martm) for use us the bottom wire of the drug. This had been used by other organizations and had heen under consideration by the wire-drag parties for some time. Certain disudrnntuges in the use of this cable have now been overcome. The advantages are longer life, less resistance, and less weight for the same strength, permitting the use of smaller flQats. New large buoys have been designed and are being constructed. These will have less resistance with greater carrying capacity. Experiments were made with flouts of balsa, wood treated by a special process. These flouts were found too weak structurally to withstand the heavy wear. The use of wireless telegraph for communication between the launches is being investigated. The spacing of area dragged to different depths in plotting has been greatly improved by the adoption of an instrument known as the "wire-drag buoy spacer," constructed at the office of the Survey. A form of monthly journal for wire drag work has been adopted Which makes it possible to estimate the unit cost of the work.

Sm1MARY oF RESULTs.-Leveling: 3 permanent bench mnrks established. Hydrogruphy: 56 square miles of area dragged, 190.7 miles run while drugging, 1,564 angles measured, 75 soundings made on uncharted shoals, 1 tide station established, 1 hydrogruphlc sheet finished.

Wire-drag work in Buzzards Bay, Mass., begun in May, was in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year, Westport Point being m:ed as headquarters for the party. On account of lobstering in the region, it was necessary in the early part of the season to mark out the. areas to be dragged and this was continued until the early part of September, after which time the fishing operations were not extensive enough to interfere with the work. A tide stuff was established at the mouth of 'Vestport River and connected with permanent bench marks. This staff was used during the entire season. Tidal observations were be~n June 30 .and discontinued September 29. Enough natural obJects were located by triangulation to control the work when used in connection with objects previously determined. Drag operat.ions were continued throughout the se~s.on. The usual methods of wire-drag work were followed, the pos1t10n of the end launch being determined from the guiding launch. The guiding launch was a double ender, and the: drag was set out and taken up over the bow. For setting out, the launch was anchored from the stern. A new type of engine was used to furnish power to the reel. During the season a breakwater at Salters Point, Mass., was located. 1Vork was closed on September 29.
SuMMARY OF nEsur.Ts.-Trlangulatlon: 10 square miles of area covered, 2 stations In supplemental scheme occupied for horlzontnl measures, 1 geographic position determined. Hydrogrnphy: 50.5 square miles of urea drugged, 121.9 miles run while drugging, 753 angles measured, 1 hydrogrnphlc sheet partly finished, scale 1 : 25,000.

In April, 1915, preparations were made for wire-drag work on the coast of Massachusetts southward from the vicinity of Scituate, Mass. On April 27 the positions of ~he beacons marking the entrance to the Cape Cod Canal were determmed. The party was organized at Hull, Muss. The guiding launch and tender arrived on May 7. On May 11 the party removed to Scituate. The end launch arrived on May 12 and the first field work was done on May 13. From May 13 to June 30 wire-drag work was in progress. A 4,000-foot drag was used in shoal water and one 5,000 to G,000 feet lone: in deeper water. :N"umerous shoals were found in the area examined. All of these were single large bowlders or piles of smaller rocks on a bottom of sand and pebbles. The approximate northern limit for bottom of this character appears to be a line extending east from Minots Ledge Lighthouse. It seems probable that this formation extends into Cape Cod Bay. vVith one exception, less depth than charted was found on every shoal indication). and large patches of bowlders were found in unexpected places. ;::;ix separate piles of bowlders were found in an area

supposed to be free from obstructions, with depths over them of 25! to 41 feet. The charted depths in the vicinity were 48 to 66 feet. In addition to the usual trouble with lobster traps, the work was interfered with by a large number of mackerel nets. These nets float on the surface and are anchored at the bottom, while the lobster traps rest on the bottom. The usual practice was observed of marking out sections in shoal water for the operation of the drag and giving advance notice to fishermen of the dates when work would be done. A larger launch than usual was used us an end launch with satisfactory results. A few objects were located by triangulation for the control of the work. A wireless practice set was established on the guiding launch by means of which weather reports, etc., were receiYed daily from Boston. It is proposed to test this means of communication when a 24,000-foot drug is used later in the season.

Between August 4 and October 22 a revision was made of the triangulation and topography in the vicinity of Salem, Mass. Preparations for field work were made and several triangulation stations and tidal bench murks were recovered by August 13, when the work was temporarily suspended. Field operations were resumed on September 22 and continued until the work was completed on October 22. The following old triangulation stations were recovered: Bakers Island Light, Bald Hill, Bolles, Coddon, Coney Island, Derby Wharf Light, F1 U. S. E., Folly Hill, Fort Pickering Light, Great Haste, Great Misery, Hospital Point Light, Lee U. S. E., Leggs Hill, Marblehead, and North Gooseberry Rocle The following objects, of which the positions were previously determined, were recovered: Abbott Hull (Marblehead), Abbott Rock, Stone Beacon, tall spire with turrets 1900 (Beverly), Bowditch Ledge Beacon, Great Aqua Vitre, Halfway Rock, Hardy's Rock, Little Haste, Marblehead Black Top Church, Marblehead Rock Beacon, Marblehead standpipe. The positions of 21 aids to navigation and prominent objects useful as landmarks were determined. A number of tidal bench marks were recovered. Various town plans and maps were obtained and corrected where necessary to show present conditions, and these have been filed with a chart on which the positions of new wharves and the locution of railway lines within the limits of chart 244 are shown. The water fronts of the towns were examined and changes were noted. Information was obtained from the United States Engineer's office at Boston, the State Board of Harbor Commissioners at Boston, and the city engineers at Beverly, Manchester, and Salem.

During the six months ending DecemLer 31, 1914, the party on the steamer llydrograplicr wus e~gage~ in a hydrographic resurvey of Long Island Sound Let ween J<.,xecut10n Rocks and Norwalk Islands, including Oyster Bay, also a resurvey of a part of Pollock Hip Slue. "\Vol'k was closed for the season on December 3 nnd the ship proceeded to Baltimol'e for repairs. The hydrography in Long Island Sound consisted in running intermediate lines of soundings between lines in the old work, developing all douLtful ureas, locating all aids to navigation not Lefore located, and showing all improvements along the shore that could be determined from the sounding launch. The inshore areas along the north shore and in the vicinity of Oyster Bay were developed with the launch, and the area of the Sound proper was covered by the ship. Signals were determined by sextant cuts observed at the different triangulation stations, and consisted of water tanks, flag poles, cupolas, chimneys, etc. Owing to the presence of so many natural oLjects no signals had to be built. The weather during July was unfa rnrable for rapid progress. In the launch work there were discovered 18 rocky shoals, all of which were menaces to navigation and not hitherto known. In addition there were discovered and located numerous rocky patches with from 20 to 30 feet of water on them. All of the dangers located were immediately reported and were pu?lished in the N ot1ces to Mariners. The finding of so many shoals with the lead alone in areas already suneyed and used so extensively by shipping shows the prime necessity of dragging such areas. . Bench marks were established at Stamford, Conn., and at Oyster Bay, N. Y. At Stamford permission was obtained to put a bronze murker, in addition to others, in the Stamford Y ucht Club building, which was in course of erection. At Oyster Bay two bronze markers were placed, one in the town hall and one in u bank building. At Saugatuck the l7nite<l Stutes Army Engineers' bench marks were connected with the bench marks of the Suney by a line of levels, thus ascertaining the relation of the plane of reference used by the Engineers to that of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. In Oyster Bay and Cold Spring Harbor the hydrography was executed: and in ad<lition a tertiary scheme of triangulat10n was observed which v;ill serve as a basis of a new topographic survey. All prominent objects were cut in and described. In the vicinity of Throgs Neck a search was made for some reported sho11l soundings, but they were not found. In the middle of November work in Long Island Sound was suspended and the ship proceeded to Monomoy Point, Mass., to search :for reported shoals in Pollock Rip Slue. It was found that mm buoy

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

On June 15, 1915, the party on the steamer llydrographer began a hydrographic resurvey of the channels at the entrance to New York Harbor. Tidal data for this survey were obtained from an automatic tide gauge maintained by the Corps of Engineers, United States Army, and from a tide staff established on the iron steamboat pier at Coney Island. This staff was connected by leveling with the Engineer's staff and bench mark on the old iron steamboat pier. Sounding was begun June 17 in the vicinity of иwest Bank Lighthouse and continued whenever weather permitted through the remainder of the month. The area surveyed up to the close of the fiscal year lies southward иof Ambrose Channel, between the limits of the United States Army Engineer survey and Sandy Hook, and as far north as "\-Vest Banir Lighthouse. The western limit includes the old main channel. Sounding lines were run 100 meters apart and soundings were taken frequently at a speed of 3! to 4 knots. Strong variable currents in the vicinity of Sandy Hook made difficult the proper spacing of lines at this slow speed. Soundings were taken only in moderate weather and comparatively smooth water. . The positions of West Bank Lighthouse and North Beacon, Sandy Hook, were determined.

The work of chart revision along the ~hores of Great South Bay and Fire Island Inlet, Long Island, was in progress July 1 and continued until October 31. The triangulation was started from the line Nicoll-Island, previously determined, and extended eastward through five figures to Smiths Point, a distance of 16 miles. ~he geographic positions of all prominent objects, such as factory chimneys, windmills, standpipes, etc., of a permanent nature, were carefully determined, so that in the future topographic and hydrographic revision in this locality sufficient points should be arnilable to readily carry on the work without additional triangulation. Many of these objects may be used in the work of offshore hydrography. The topography of this section. was found to have greatly changed since the last survey. Numerous 1mprovements have been mude along most of the shores of Great South Buy additional beach resorts and summer colonies have been established, canals dug, and bulkheads erected, and the old settlements and villages have expanded considerably. No marked change has occurred in the general shore line, except around the inlets.

:mutely 300 feet; Gilgo Inlet has entirely closed; und changes have occurred at Jones Inlet. The only changes in the hydrography of Great South Bay from that shown on the existing chart are in the vicinity of the inlets and where dredging has been done in the creeks and canals. A careful survey was made of Fire Island Inlet and the bar. The results of this suney show a channel with a depth of 9 feet over the bur at :mean low water. The channel has changed its course from that shown on existing charts and now runs :dong Oak Island Beach. It is buoyed and has been in use for two years. The bar and channel leading into Fire Island Inlet are subject to rapid changes, and are almost inrnrinbly affected by severe southerly gales. Lines of soundings were run from the mainland to the beach resorts, but no changes were noted from the information as now published. Numerous piers of a temporary character arc built in the bay from the beach resorts and remain during the summer months, but are taken up for the winter on account of ice. A depth of 4 feet at low water will be found at the end of these piers. All creeks und canals affording sufficient depths for motor boats were carefully sounded, but the depths at the mouths of these are constantly changing.

These sheets were then taken into the field, and where the shore line had changed and along the main channels and shore the shore line was rerun to a junction with the transferred shore line. All changes were noted and joined in correct position with the old work. N-umerous stacks, chimneys, spires, and other objects were determined as a control for the hydrography and topography and to afford objects from which the position of aids to nasigat10n may be determined. The hydrographic work was begun on September 10 and continued until December 12.

In October and November a line of precise leYels was run between Perth Amboy and Sandy H~>0k; N. J .и connecting bench mark "R" at Keyport, the State Geological Survey bench mark at Perth Amboy, and bench mark " C " on Sandy Hook. This work was done in accordance with the general instructions for precise leveling, the line being run in both directions and all sections checked within the reqmred limit. The line was carried along the railroad track, using the rail for the rod supports. Transportation for the party was by nn electric car line. Besides the 3 bench marks recoYered from the oli1 work, 10 new permanent bench murks were established in the 29 miles of. line. Connection was also made at Sandy Hook with two of the United States Army bench marks, one !mown as the ordnance bench mark, which is in front of the proving ground office, and the other known as the Engineers' bench mark, at the northeast corner of the Engineers' building. The latter was also connected directly with the tide staff at Sandy Hook.

From July 1 to September 14 work was continued on the topographic survey of the Passaic River. This work was executed on a scale of 1: 5,000, and includes much detail in the vicinity of the city of Passaic, such as wharves, иdocks, bridges, and trolley and steam railroads. Surveys by city and county engineers were utilized for lines of streets, etc. On September 15 work was begun on the survey of the Hackensack River, and was completed by April 30. It was found necessary to erect observing tripods for the triangulation, in many places from 9 to 14 feet in height, to see over the high meadow grass. A portable observing scaffold 9 feet in height designed and built by the party Was successfully used. . The tertiary triangulation of the river was extended to Anderson Street Bridge in Hackensack and was completed January 4. It was connected with a base line measured on the Anderson Street Bridge by the United States Army Engineers, the ?omputed ler;igth of ~he base as determined by the Coast and Geodetic Snrvey tnang11lat10n agreeing satisfactorily with the measured ,length. In the early part of the fiscal year the triangulation had been connected with u, base line measnred by the United States Army Engineers at Little Ferry Brirlge. The topographic survey was also extended to Anderson Street Bridge and was completed April 22. This work covers three planetable sl~cets scale 1 : 5,000, and includes the Hackensack River from triangulatidn station Public to Anderson Street Bridge. The detailed topography was carried into the interior one-half mile from the shores of the river.

The shores of the river from its mouth to the town of Hackensack .are bordered by low meadow land, interspersed with small, crooked creeks, except at Snake Hill, which is an isolated hill of trap rock rising abruptly out of the lowland to an elevation of 208 feet above mean high water. Little Snake Hill to the eastward is also an isolated hill rising abruptly out of the meadow and has an elevation of 80 feet above mean high water. New Canal cut into Berrys Creek, on the west shore of the Hackensack, was excavated by the Erie Railway Co. This canal shortens the distance between the river and Rutherford, N. J., and is the only route with 12 feet draft at mean low water to Rutherford. The canal is navigable for light-draft motor boats to Carlstadt, N. J. Local maps furnished by the municipal engineers were used where practicable for details of streets, buildings, and in some places for contours in the towns and villages. A rapid reconnoissance was made of the river above Anderson Street Bridge. For about 2 miles above the bridge both shores are low and marshy; from there upward the banks become steeper and the river is contracted until at New Milford it is but 25 meters wide. The hydrography of the Hackensack from Sawmill Creek to triangulation station Brick was surveyed between March 23 and April 16. This portion of the river had not been sounded or dredged by the United States Engineers, as the depth is 12 feet or more. There are strong tidal currents in the river. Numerous creeks emptying into Hackensack River are navigable for small boats. The Army Engineers are maintaining a dredged channel 150 ~eet wide and 12 feet deep at mean low water from the mouth of the river to the Court Street Bridge at Hackensack. Tides were observed ut Patterson Plank Road Bridge during the progress of the hydrographic work. On May 1 the party proceeded to Perth Amboy, N. J., and began a resurvey of Arthur Kill. Obsenation of horizontal angles was begun May 25. A scheme of triangulation was developed, based on stations of existing triangulation by the Federal and State authorities, and connected 'vith the triangulation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Obsenations for the triangulation of Arthur Kill were completed June 21.

On .June 29 the work was completed between Barnegat Inlet n11d Belmar. All prominent objects along shore or visible therefrom were determined in position, and poles 16 feet in .height with flags on them were placed and determined about 1 mile apart. Two or three smaller poles were placed between the higher flagpoles. The most northern and southern houses in each town, also all isolated houses or those of characteristic outline, were determined and described. Only where the topographic features could be obtained without delaying the determination of objects for use in the hydrography was any attempt made to fill in the topography.

Between .Tune 11, 1914, and October 2, 1914, the party on the steamer Endea1Jor was engaged in hydrographic surveys at the entrance to Delaware Bay. , A signal, Fly, was established on the eastern shore of Delaware Bay, about 3 miles north of Cape May, and :from this and the various lighthouses, which were old stations, a numuer of objects in Cupe May and the new lighthouses at Brandywine Shoal nnd Deadи man Shoal were determined. At Cape May a number of objects previously determined approximately were reobserved and determined, nnd also the large pavilion at Cold Spring Harbor. The hydrography was extended from the shore line nt Cape May, from a point about opposite the large Cape May Hotel, southward to beyond the 6-fathom curve on the edge of the main ship channel and northward up Delaware Bay to Deadman Shoal and vicinity. Enough of the south and west sides of Crow Shoal were included to join the new 3-fathom curve with the old. That part of Crow Shoal north and east of the 1914 work was crossed at numerous places while under way with the ship running on course and time sounding, but no indications of changes were found in this area. Very extensive changes were found in the shoals and channels south and west of Cape May. The old shoals have changed in position and extent and new channels have been formed. These changes were all :followed out and developed. Deadman Shoal was found to have cut away somewhat at the northwest end and extended slightly on the east side. More extensive changes were found on the shoals southwest of Deadmnn Shoal and these were followed out and developed. The work was closed October 2.

The resunиey of the east shore of Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries in the vicinity of Cape Charles, Va., by the party on the schooner J11 atchless was in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year. The hydrography of the creeks and the close development of all shoal areas, bars, and channels from the shore to a depth of G or 7 fathoms were continued until November 30, when the vessel sailed for Baltimore. The hydrography covered all of the creeks and the bay for a distance of 2 to 5 miles from shore. Special development was made of creek bars and channels. A special examination was made for a shoal spot with .17 feet of water reported in latitude 37░ 37' 12" and longitude 76░ 01', but no depth less than 26 feet was foun~. The mean low-water plane for this work was determined by sunultaneous tidal observations at Cedar View Wharf, Nandua Creek, and Onancock, on Onancock Creek.и The shore line of Nassawaddox Creek was surveyed, and 48 miles of telemeter line were rnn to locate hydrogruphic signals on this creek and on the main shore of the bay. The triangulation for control of the hydrographic and topogruphic work was completed, and the triangulation stations were permanently marked. A hydrographic survey was made of Nassawaddox, Occahannock, Craddock, N andua, Butchers, Pungoteague, and Onancock Creeks, and the hydrography remaining to be done in the area from N assawaddox to Pungoteugue Creek and from Pungoteague to near Chesconessex Creek was completed by N ornmber 30.

During the period from March 1 to May 13 the party was engaged on the triangulation, topography, and hydrography of the west end of Albemarle Sound from Bluff Point to Edenhouse Point, including an urea about 14 miles long by 11 miles wide. Triangulation stations, Cypress and Pun, of 1909, were recovered and occupied, and two new stations, Skinner and Capehart, were established un<l occupied. Observations were made on a sufficient number of points to serve for the control of the hydrogruphic and topographic work. The topography of the shores was done on a scale of 1: 40,000. Large areas were added to the topography south of Salmon Creek and about Scotch Hall. The topography of Pembroke Creek was well developed to Bolton Bridge, 2 miles above the United States fish hatchery. Large ureas were added to the topography around Edenton and in its approaches. All of the area mentioned was covered by sounding lines about 700 meters apart north and south and 900 meters east and west. The channels leading to Edentoni the mouth of Roanoke River, and all bars were developed by lines of soundings from 100 to 300 meters apart as required. Particular attention was paid to the ()-foot and 12-foot contours. The hydrography of Pembroke Creek was carried 4 miles above the United Stutes fi!:ih hatchery, or 5 miles from Edenton. Tidal information for the reduction was obtained from an automatic tide gauge maintained by the United States Engineers at the Pembroke fish hatchery and from gauges at Edenton and Laurel Point Lighthouse. Simultaneous readings were made at Edenton and Laurel Point Lighthouse and between the Edenton gauge and the Pembroke gauge. The tide gauges were connected by leveling with permanent bench marks. The work in the western end of Albemarle Sound was completed on May 14 and the jl,f atchless took up the survey of Croatan Sound, includmg topography and hydrography. Sufficient old triangulation stations were recovered to control the topography and hydrograph;y, and such additional signals as needed were cut in from known porn ts. The topography of all of the shore of Croatan Sound was excuted on a scale of 1: 40,000, all prominent objects on or near the shore line being located. Sounding lines were run north and south one-fonrth mile apart, and channels and bars were developed by lines from 100 to 200 meters apart with cross lines about 400 meters apart. Tides were recorded on a gauge established at Burnside иwharf, on the west side of Hounoke Island.

At the beginning of ,January the llydro,qraplier was undergoing repairs at Baltimore, Md., and the officers of the vessel were engaged in the completion of the records of the previous season's work. On January 16 the ship left Baltimore to take np a resurvey of Albemarle Sound, N. C., going by way of the Chesapeake and Albemarle Canal. Headquarters were established at Hertford, about 11 miles up the Perquimans River, where coal and provisions could be obtained. There being no regular means of water supply, a pipe line was run from a private water tank to a near-by wharf. Coal for the vessel was delivered at the same wharf. The work was done in cooperation with the party on the schooner 1lfatchless, the llydro,qrapher d_oing us much as possible of the work in the more exposed localities and the sheltered portions being left for the illatchless. The triangulation was extended from the line Batts 2-Laurel Point Lighthouse of the work of 1909 to the mouth of Perquimans River and well up toward Hertford. Considerable difficultv was experienced in joining the r!ver t_ri~ngulation with the long lines in the sound, and to nccomphsh this it was found necessary to erect a signal in 20 :feet of water in the sound. All shore stations established were securely marked with standard station marks set in concrete and reference murks were placed at each station. The topography on the north sJ:ore of the sound covered the shore :from Bluff Point to Harvey Pomt, except Y eopin Hi Yer; 5 miles eastward from Canaan Cove, Perquimans Hiver; and eastward from the mouth of Little River to "\Vade Point, including the greater part of Flatty Creek. On the south .side of the sound the topography included the shore line from 2 mil.es east of the Scuppernong Rn'er to Long Shoal Point, Alligator Rn-er. The shore line was difficult to survey, consisting largely of wooded marsh. On the north shore it was necessary to run plane-table traverse lines connecting the triangulation points to control the topography. At places dead stumps extend out to quite a distance from the shore line, making navigation for small boats dangerous. There are few objects of importance to the navigator along these shores and no settlements except a few fish houses and wharves. The hydrography, which was the principal work done, covers nearly ail the water areas of the main l>ody of the sound from Bluff Point to Powells Point. The inshore and sheltered portion of the work was left to be done by the party on the schooner M atchle8s. The distances being great, it was necessary to erect tall hydrographic signals. One of these, at station 'Vade, was observed on at a distance of 12 nautical miles. This signal was constructed in one working day, which includes the work of cutting trees, etc. Th~ . highest part is 55 feet above the water and the lowest part of the v1s1ble section is 36 :feet. Tide gauges were established apd ti~lal planes determined at Laurel Point Lighthouse and Wade Pomt Llghthouse.

Work was begun May 14 on the determination of geographic positions of aids to navigation in Core and Bogue Sounds, N. C. This work was undertaken at the request of the Bureau of Lighthouses. A launch and a house boat were chartered at Beaufort for the use of the party, and actual field work beganи on May 18. Twenty-five old triangulation stations were recovered and occupied and two new ones established and occupied by June 10, when the field work was completed. When this work was undertaken all of the lights necessary for the navigation of Core and Bogue Sounds were in place, the structures were of substantial concrete construction, and no changes in the lighting were contemplated, so that with the lights determined in posit10n and plotted on the charts and the triangulation stations permanently marked and described, any future changes deemed necessary in the aids to navigation may readily be made by the officers of the Lighthouse Service. At most of the stations the work consisted in observing a round of horizontal directions (direct and reverse) on the stations, lights, and natural objects. 'Where no suitable natural objects for aids to navigation were visible, marks were placed in trees close to the station and located by tape or intersection. These marks were usually made of eight wooden strips, 2 by 4 inches and 4 feet long, painted white and spiked to large and prominent trees. They will serve as points for hydrography, topography, and triangulation. A special effort was made to locate all church spires, club houses, and other prominent objects. At each station occupied all objects visible which are suitable for the purposes sought were observed upon. Many reference points were occupied and a round of observations taken on all prominent objects, including the station. Many of the li~hts were occupied with a sextant to furnish directions to objects which could not well be determined from the shore stations alone.

On July 1 the construction of seven large hydrographic signals on the coast of South Carolina for the use of the party on the steamer Bache was in progress. A hired motor boat was used for the transportation of the party. Lumber for the signals in most instances had to be towed a long distance to the nearest point on the beach to the locality where it was to be used and then carried by hand to the desired location. Tripods 35 feet in height, strongly braced and anchored in the sand, were erected. A 4 by 4 inch pole was extended above the tripod, to which the upper portion of the target was fastened, and galvanized wire guys were attached as an additional safeguard. 10684 ░-15--5

Targets 10 by 12 feet in size were placed on the signals, with the bottom of the target 40 to 50 feet above sea level. It was afterwards found necessary to board up the signals on the ocean side to make them show more distinctly against the background of the woods. Observations on lmown positions were made from the signals 'wherever visible, and from Cape Homain and Georgetown Lighthouses on such signals as could be seen from them. This work was completed July 13.

The hydrographic surveys by the party on the steamer Bache on the coast of South Carolina between Bull Bay and Georgetown Jetties were in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year. The command of the vessel was transferred to the present commanding officer ,July H. By that date tide stations had been established at Georgetown and Cape Homain, S. C., two triangulation stations had been occupied to locate shore signals and buoys, and arrangements had been made to borrow buoys for the survey from the Lighthouse Service. High shore signals had been built along the coast from Charleston to Georgetown by another party. The work after July () was to locate these signals Ly triangulation and sextant angles, to place the buoys to be used in the suney, and to sound over the area between Charleston and the Georgetown Jetties, extending from the 3-fathom cun-e out to the 100-fathom curve. This work was completed Ly October 23, and the Bache proceeded to Norfolk for repairs. The shore signals erected prior to July () at various points along the coast were named as follows: Dewees, Price, Bull, Raccoon, Santee, South, and North. St~tion Bull was the site of an old lighthouse which had been prevwusly located by triangulation, and cuts had Leen taken on stations Santee and South from Homain and Georgetown Lighthouses. As it was the intention to locate the remainder of these stations subsequently by triangulation, it was deemed sufficient for immediate use to locate them bv sextant cuts from the ship at anchor offshore, although additionai triangulation cuts were obtained on a few of them. Inasmuch as the coast in this vicinity is very flat, without hills or even high sand dunes, it was impossible to get locations for the hydrogrnphy from shore signals more than about 9 miles from shore, and as the 10-fathom cun-e runs parallel to the coast and about 15 miles offshore it was impossible to get locations from shore objects for several miles inside the 10-fathom curve. Since it was deemed of prime importance to make u careful development out to and be-

yond the 10-futhom curve, and it was not considered sufficiently accurate to attempt to develop this outer area by dead reckoning, it was decided to use buoys dropped in a line parallel to the shore at frequent intervals as far offshore as they could be accurately located. Six first-class bell and whistle buoys were loaned by the lighthouse inspector at Charleston for this purpose; and in order to make them visible for as great a distance as possible, wooden superstructures carrying a flagpole and 11 flag were designed for them. The buoys were placed by a lighthouse tender as nearly as possible in the desired location and about 4 miles apart, and they were then located by sextant cuts from the Bache anchored at the greatest distance from shore at which it was possible to sec shore objects. Sextant angles to locate the ship and to cut in the buoys were taken very carefully with the ship at anchor, and good locutions of the buoys were thus obtaine<l. .As the work coYered a greater stretch of the coast than could be covered by the six buoys at one time they were shifted by the lighthouse tender from time to time as required. The inshore hydrography covers the area between Charleston and Georgetown ,Jetties, and extends from a depth of between 2 and 3 fathoms inshore to a line of signal buoys placed about 14 miles offshore. All of this work wns located by positions either on shore objects or on the signal lmoys. The hand lead was used in depths less thnn 14- fathoms, und the trolley sounding apparatus in greater depths. Lines were spaced slightly less than 1 mile apurt und run normal to the coast; but a close development was giren to un area of about 30 square miles in the vicinity of Charleston Jetty, and a slightly larger area off Georgetown Jetties. Special care was given to developing area1;> where shoal or uneven depths were found, and about 3G such spots were closely developed. The total area covered by these developments was approximately 76 square miles. Soundings in all the inshore work were taken from 50 to 150 meters apart, depending upon the depth of water. At the request of the lighthouse inspector ut Charleston, S. C., the position o:f the wreck of the schooner Fredericlc lV. Day off Charleston Light Vessel und the least water over it were determined and published in the Notice to Mariners. The offshore hydrography covers an area bounded on the inshore side by a line of buoys about 14 miles offshore, and extends seaward to outside the 100-:fathom curve. The lines were run in u northwest und southeast direction, und in all an area of about 1,800 square miles Was covered. All of this work was done by dead reckoning, and lines were spaced ▒ miles apart. All patent logs used in the work were carefully standardized, nnd the ship was swung three times for compass deviation. On tho dead-reckoning lines the ship was anchored every two hours for current observations, and the resultant of the two observations mnde at start and finish of the two-hour run was used to correct the course steered. At the 100-futhom curve current observations were taken from an anchored buoy by means of a current pole and line from a small boat. Astronomic observations on the sun and stars were taken when possible on these lines. Up to 15 fathoms the soundings were taken with the hand lead. At greater depths a trolley sounding appnrntus wns used with a special device for teeling in the line by steam.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

In addition to the current observations before mentioned, currents were observed every half hour day and night whenever the ship was at anchor on the working ground and the sea was not too rough. An anemometer was installed on the ship and the velocity of the wind taken at the same time with the current observations. An automatic tide gauge was maintained during the work at the Georgetown Jetty, and continuous staff readings were made day and night at Cape Romain, near the lighthouse, to facilitate the reducи tion of soundings. On January 1, 1915, the Bache was at Norfolk, Va., undergoing extensive repairs. These being completed, the Ycsscl sailed for the working ground on February 19 to make hydrographic surveys off the coasts of Georgia, and Florida. For this work a separate party had been engaged in building tall signals along the coast and determining their positions. The work of the Bache after February rn consisted in adapting, placing, and determining the position of survey buoys; magnetic obscrrntions in Chesapeake Bay and on the working grounds; and sounding over the area between St. Simons Lighthouse, near Brunswick, Ga., and a point about 5 miles south of the jetties at the entrance to St. ,Johns RiYcr, Fla., and exte'nding from the 3-fathom cune out to the 100-futhom curve. This work was completed by .June 20, when the wssel sailed from Fernandina~ Fla., :for Baltimore, Md., :for ornrhauling and repairs.и In February, 1915, six shore iiignals had been erected by l\fr. J. S. Bilby on the coasts of Georgia and Florida :for the use of this party, five of them being new stations and one an old triangulation station. A number of other points, such as lighthouses, water tanks, and windmills which had previously been determine,d in position, wcrr used by the vessel in the location <_>f soundings. These signals proved more satisfactory than any prenously used in similar work, being tall enough to show over the tops of any trees f~ither near the coast or farther inland, so that they were plainly visible in the morning when the sun was shining on their front surfaces and in the afternoon when the sun was buck of them. At the request of the lighthouse inspector at Charleston, S. C., the new St. Andrews Sound Lighthouse and two channel beacons in St. Andrews Sound were located by triangulation, two stations being и occupied :for that purpose. In the work off the coasts of Georgia and Florida the same system of offshore signals was used as in the previous work off the coast of South Carolina. Six first-class bell and whistle buoys were loaned by the inspector of lighthouses at Charleston, and superstructures were installed on them to make them visible to as great a distance as possible. The superstructures were of the same design as those used in the previous work; but extra heavy I-inch pipe was substituted for the three-fourth-inch pipe used in their constn1ction, and plain black flags were used instead of the international code flags previously used, and this change increased the visibility of the signals considerably. Experiments were made to determine the proper distance apart these buoys should be spaced, and it was found that 4 miles was the most economical spacing consistent with the accurate location of sounding lines. The buoys were dropped by a lighthouse tender as close as possible to the desired location. They were then located by sextant cuts from

the steamer anchored at frequent intervals at the greatest distance offshore from which shore objects could be seen. Sextant cuts to locate the ship and cut in buoys were taken very carefully with the ship at anchor, and angles all around the horizon were taken to close the circle as in triangulation as far as possible; very good locations of the buoys were thus obtained. The buoys were shifted from time to time by the lighthouse tender as required. The inshore hydrography extends from St. Simons Lighthom;;e to 5 miles south of the jetties at the entrnnce to the St. Johns River, Fla., and from the 3-fathom cnrrn inshore to about 2 miles outside a line of survey buoys placed about 13 miles offshore; a few lines and some development work were done outside of this in clear weather when the buoys showed plainly. All of this work was located by sextant positions either on shore objects or on the signal buoys. All soundings were taken from the ship with the hand lead. Lines were spaced usually slightly. less than 1 mile apart and run normal to the shore line. Off the entrances to Fernun<lma, Brunswick, and the St. Johns River, over an area in each case of about 40 square miles, lines were spaced not over one-half mile apart. Special care was taken to develop areas where shoals or uneven depths were found, and about 30 such areas were closely investigated. Soundings were taken from 50 to 150 meters apart. . At the request of the lighthouse inspector ut Charleston, a small amount of hunch work was done between the jetties at Fernandina, Fla. On the way south the shoalest water on the wreck of the schooner Fredericlc W. Day, off Charleston Light Vessel, was determined. The offshore hydrography covers an area bounded on the inshore side by a line of buoys about 13 miles offshore and extending offshore to outside the 100-futhom curve. The lines were run in nn east and west direction, the most northerly line beginning about 8 miles north of buoy A, due eastward of St. Simons Lighthouse, Gu. The most southerly line begun at buoy M, due east of the Continental Hotel and 5 miles south of the jetties at the entrance to St. Johns River, Fla. All of this work was done by dead reckoning, lines being spaced 1 mile apart to just outside the 10-:fothom curve, 2 miles apart out to the end of the inshore hydrographic sheet, and 4 miles apart out to the 100-futhom curve, except that from the northern end of the work to Brunswick Light Vessel lines were spaced not more than 1 mile apart out to the end of the inshore hydrographic sheet on account of the very uneven character of the bottom. Each lineи started from a fixed position near the inshore end of the line of suney buoys and extended ont to the 100-fathom curYe and buck to connect with a location from the buoys again. Great care was exercised in the deadreckoning work to make it us accurate as possible. Patent logs used Were carefully standardized. The ship was swung four times for compass deYiation. Current observations were taken from the ship at anchor at frequent intervals and .the results used to correct the courses steered. Astronomical observations were taken on the sun and stars when practicable. Sea-water temperatures were taken at frequent intervals on all dead-reckoning lines. Mean velocities of the wind were obtained for each two-hour section of the line to determine leeway for different wind velocities. Soundings were taken With the hand lead up to 15 fathoms and with a trolley apparatus,

with a special device for reeling in the line by steam, at greater depths. Soundings were taken at intervals of from one to five minutes, the vessel running at. a speed of 4 to 4! knots until a depth was reached where a vertical sounding could not he obtained. This usually occurred at 30 to 40 fathoms. It was then found expedient to run full speed for three minutes and stop the engine for two minutes, the sounding being then taken. The sounding-s on the lino were spaced from 150 meters apart in shoal water to 2 miles apart in deep water. Current observations were taken every half hour, day and night, when the ship was at anchor, and anemometer readings were taken at the same time to determine wind velocities. On n few of the lines the 100-fathom curve came in the Gulf Stream and a current velocity of nearly 3 knots was encountered. Tidal records were obtained from automatic tide gauges nt Fernandina and St. Augustine, Flu., and from a tide staff on St. Simons Island.

At the request of the United States Bureau of Fisheries a scheme of triangulation was extended from Apalachicola Bay through St. Vincent Sound, Fla., in order to furnish points for a survey of the oyster beds existing in the latter body of water. This triangulation was started from the line St. Vincent Point 2-St. George Lighthouse and extended through seven figures to the head of St. Yincent Sound, a distance of 20 miles, where a connection was made with the station Hugged Point, determined in 18(i0. Between the main scheme triangulation stations and on points uffording the most desirable conditions concrete blocks 8 by 8 inches by 3! feet w~re placed in the ~round, leaving about G inches above the surface; these were appropnutely marked and their positions carefully determined. These intersection stations, together with the main scheme stations, afford a sufficient number of points for the hydrographic survey of the entire sound. In the selection of site::; and marking of stations care was taken to guarantee their permanency. The main scheme stations were marked liy a subsurface mark buried in concrete 3 feet below the surface. The surface marks consist of a regulation standard disk station murk inserted in a concrete block 8 by 8 inches by 3 feet placed in the ground, leaving about 4 inches abo,иe the surface. The reference marks used were concrete piers about 10 inches square and of varying lengths, placed sufficiently well in the ground to insure their stability; standard reference disks were inserted in these piers. At the station sitas where tall marsh grass exists the piers were built of such heights that they top the grass about 1 foot. The field work was begun N oYember 18 and completed December 23. It was much retarded by fogs and gales and on account of the necessity of waiting for favorable stages of the tide in order to visit some localities where stations necessarily had to be placed.

In the winter of 191;) the more important harbors and ports on the Gulf Coast were visited, and the inland water routes from Galveston to Corpus Christi and parts of the inland waterway system of Louisiana west of the Mississippi were inspected, using the regular passenи ger steamers or chartered launches operated by local pilots, in order to collect information for a re\'ision of United States Coast Pilot, Part VIII, Gulf Const of the United States. The offices of the United States Enginer Corps, the officials of the Lighthouse Senice, local pilots and pilots' associations, and others interested in navigation and shipping were inteniewed. In connection with this work mformation was obtained for plotи ting on charts Yarious landmarks and other aids to naYigation existи ing along the portions of the coast visited. Apparatus for current observations was installed on two light vessels, ut Southwest Pass and Heald Bank, and later an inspection was made of the apparatus and the method of making these observaи tions. Facilities for this work were afforded by the lighthouse inи spector of the eighth district. Changes and repairs to the tide station at Galveston were made, a new bench mark was established, and levels were run between the tide gauge and the old and new bench marks.

In all, 12 hydrographic signals were built ranging in height from 68 to 86 feet, the average height being 75 feet above the station maTk. .The position of each signal was determined by triangulation or traverse, and a permanent mark was placed at each signal. During the progress of the work the building of signals and location of points were carried along together. Photographs and descriptions of the signals were transmitted to the office at \Vashington. All necessary signals were built and their positions determined by March 27 and work was close<l on March 30. These signals are an innovation and decided advancement in this class of hydrographic work, enabling accurate development to be carried much farther seaward than otherwise possible in a region without natural elevations. The design and construction of the signals were by the builder, and the method of having an inexpensive shore party to erect them greatly facilitated the prosecution of the work by the Bache.

Wire-drag work was begun at Key 'Vest, Fla., on January 6. The work to be done included an examination of the west channel from the limits of previous work south of Man Key for a distance of 10 miles to a point south of the c::istern side of Marquesas Keys, with a width of 1 mile; also such sm::tll areas unfinished in the work of the previous season as could be dragged without interfering with the work first named. It was desired to drug the most doubtful remaining part of the channel from Key West to Dry Tortugas. This channel is used regularly by a naval tug and by the lighthouse tenders, but is very little used by commercial vessels. This is partly due to the weli-established belief that no undrugged area is safe. As soon as sufficient width had been dragged to make the channel safe for navigation the work was to be closed. There were several practically new features in this work. The original survey was not sufficiently close for control of the wire-drag work, and a day had to be SJ?ent in sounding over undeveloped spaces. The nrea to be examined hes from 10 to 20 miles from Key 'Vest. There is a good boat harbor with un entrance depth of 7 feet within 3 and 7 miles, respectively, of the ~nd.s of the working ground at Boca Grande Key. In order to use this it was necessary to put down a heavy mooring, as the use of anchors would cause delay each day. The launches were barely large enough to carry the party and provide very inadequate living uccommodations. Boca Grande is without fresh water or other facilities for cumping. The plan was adopted of having all work of assembling and repairing the drug done at Key 'Vest, as well as the office work. The drag party was required to have on hand a two days' supply of provisions and the necessary equipment for catching fish. Whenever at the

close. of a day the weather prospects appeared favorable, the party remamed at Boca Grande and was ready for an early start next morning. The weather conditions were usually unfavorable and high winds prevailed during much of the time. No triangulation, topography, or signal building was necessary, и1lthough severnl signals hnd to be repaired. The signals built by the party on the steamer Bache were found to be in good condition. An area of 10.8 square miles was dragged uncl 100 shoals "иere! found. Instead of the indicated snfe depth of 28 feet, a maximum safe depth of 22 feet when using great care is available. About 5 square miles of the area is entirely obstructed. Vessels using care to keep in the drngged area and drawing not more tlum 18 feet are safe. Owing to the nature of t.he locality and the existence of so many obstructions the cost of the work was greater than in similar work elsPwhere. No changes were made in the drug during the season. A new signal system was installed and u. new apparatus which had been designed and built during the preceding season was put in operation. A new tripping device received at the beginning of the season was used with satisfactory results. The hired launches proved satisfactory. An l.nspection was made of the automatic tide gauges at Key West, St. Augustine, and Fernandina.

On Jan nary 21 apparatus for current observations was installed on lightship No. 88, off the mouth of the Columbia River. This apparatus was inspected on March 6. On Murch 7 current apparatus was installed on Umatilla. Reef Light Vessel at Portland, Oreg. In March triangulation work was hegnn to connect the Luke 'Vushington triangulation of 1914 with that by the Coast and Geodetic Survey and that by the Army Engineers alonrr Lake Union and Salmon Bay. Many of the stations in this w011'r were on the tops of buildings and were marked by drill holes in the walls or in some other permanent manner. This work was completed on April 23. All stations on the ground were marked with regulation disk triunguln.tion station murks and the usual reference marks were placed. The work was started from stations Brush, Golf, and Cross of the 1914 work and carried across Porti1ge Bay to Union Bay, connecting with station Army, a United States Army Engineers monument on the 'Vashin~ton Boulevard near Union Bay. This scheme connects with the triungulation of 1913 by E. E. Smith, of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and also with other stations of the Army Engineers. The work was extended from Lake Union through Ross Valley and down Salmon Rav to the Sound, following the whole course of the Lake 'Vashington Canal, then in course of construction. A reconnoissance was made with a view to extending the work down the valley.

The resurvey of Yaquina Bay, begun in June, was in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year, by which time a triangulation scheme had been laid out and the stations permanently marked. In July n base line was laid out and measured and the signal building and the observation of angles begun. It was found necessary to carry a continuous scheme of triangulation along the shores of the river from the entrance of Yaquina Bay to the town of Toledo, und owing to the narrowness of the river short lines were used, in some cases less than 200 meters in length. Severnl stations had to be established on the mud flats and this necessitated the construction of eight platforms as stands for the observer. The lines of sight being so short very accurate methods were used in erecting the signals and great care taken in making the observations. A launch was hired for the outside hydrography on the bar and reefs, and advantage was taken of every day on which work could he done on the bar but these were very few.

SUJ1БMARY OJ<" RESULTs.-Reconnolssnn<'e: Length of scheme, 40 statute miles; 600 square miles of area covered, 11 points sele'ctcd for scheme. Signal buildи Ing: 26 observing tripods and scaffolds built, average height 72 feet.

At the beginning of the fiscal year work was in progress on the arc of primary triangulation between Memphis, Tenn., and Huntsville, Ala., the erection of signals and marking of stations having been extended from Memphis eastward to the line joining stations Ellis and Jones in the vicinity of Booneville and Corinth, Miss. By September 10 the signal building and station marking were completed to Huntsville, Ala. During the period from ,July 1 to September 10 signals were built at 15 primary stations, all of which were marked with station and reference marks. Tripods and scaffolds were built at all stations. The average height of the tripod head was 56 feet above the station mark. In addition to this a 20 to 56 foot superstructure was built on each of the signals, making the average height of the light stand 83 feet above the station mark. The precise-level bench mark in the city of Huntsville having been destroyed, it was necessary to revise the scheme in that locality to provide for a connection with the bench mark at Madison, Ala. A connection was also provided for a Laplace station at Madison. On September 11 the party and outfit were moved to Huntsville, Ala., and thence by rail to Charleston, Ind. On September 16 a reconnoissance was taken up to connect the triangulation north of Louisville with the transcontinental arc. The work of building signals and marking stations was begun on September rn and completed by November 15, after which the chief of party returned to stations Tripp, Stout, and Miller to clear obstructed lines. By November 18 all li'nes were cleared. The work was begun at the triangulation stations Lutz, Sixmile, nnd 0 & M, in the vicinity of Charleston, Ind. These three stations were established by Prof. Campbell in 1884, 1885, and 1886, and are stations of the State survey to the northward of Louisville, Ky. From these three stations the work was extended northward. The stations on the western side of the scheme are on high timbered lmobs, while on the eastern side the land is flat, p:irtly cultivated and partly covered with timber about 95 feet high. Miller and Stout, with TriJ?p as the third point, are the connecting stations on the transcontmental arc. In all there are 11 primary stations in the scheme. Stands for the instrument were built at only three of the stations. The timber on lines near these three stations was cut and the lines cleared. At seven of the stations tripod and scaffold signals were built, the average height of the tripod head being 63 feet above the station mark. In addition to this a superstructure varying in height from 20 to 38 feet was built on each of the seven signals, making the average height of the light stand 88 feet above the station mark. At stat10n Tripp a light stand was built, the top

Leveling: One-half mile of levels run. Azimuth: Observations mude u t four stations.

The observation of angles in the primary triangulation between Memphis, Tenn., and Huntsville, Ala., begun in the latter part of the fiscal year, was in progress on July 1. The observing party used horses and wagons belonging to the Survey for transportation between stations while the light keepers traYeled by rail or by hired conveyances. At all but two of the main-scheme stations it was necessary to elevate the instrument from 30 to 75 feet and the lightstand 20 feet higher. The base figure and the work extending 15 miles westward to connect with the stations of the United States Engineers and the Mississippi RiYer Commission hud been completed before July 1, and the work after that date was the extension of the triangulation from the base figure eastward to Huntsville, Ala., to connect with previous work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Spirit-level connection was made between the Coast and Geodetic Snney bench mark near the depot at Madison, Ala., and the Laplace station Madison. On October 16 the party left :Memphis for Charleston, Ind., to take up the work of connecting the tnangulation in the vicinity of Louisville, . Ky., with the thirty-ninth parallel arc.

On l\foy 23 the party left Salt Lake City to take up the work of preparing stations, returning to Sult Lake City June 5. On June !) un automobile truck ordered for the transportation of the party and equipment wns rccehиed and put in commission, and on June 10 the party again left Salt Lake City to resume work in the field. By June 17 the stations up to and including Cache-Bigbutte had been made ready for occupation, and on ,June 18 the reconnoissance and preparation of stations to the westward were begun. By June 30 seven new stations had been selected and marked ancl an instrument stand erected at each. ProYision was made for connection with three triangulation stations of the United States Geological Snrvey and with one precise level bench mark. At the close of the fiscal year work was in progress in the Yicinitv of Boise, Idaho. The automobile truck proved to be an efficient method of transportation as it decreased considerably the unit cost of the work from what it would have been with horses and wagons for moving the party with its outfit and supplies.

Work on the secondary triangulation along the coast of Washington between Grays Harbor and the Strait of Juan de Fu ca, which had been begun in 1913, was taken up again in July, 1914. The necessary scaffolds and light-stands had been erected in 1913 so that the only work to be done was the obse1;vation of angles. The triangulation was to be of secondary accuracy and a 7-inch instrument was used in the work. All transportation was by pack animals, as the country is practically without roads. The observing party reached Ellis, the first station to be occupied, on July 12. Between July 12 and November 4 stations Ellis, La Push, James Island, Hoh, Destruction Island Lighthouse, Queets, Tajolah, Baldy, and Langley were occupied. The original plan called for the occupation of another station, Pioneer, but weather conditions were so unfavorable in the latter part of the season that it was deemed advisable to close work on November 1 without occupying that station. Enough observations were made during the season to get a position check on station Langley and an azimuth check on the line Langley to Pioneer. In order to expedite the work a second observing party was used during the latter part of the season. The scaffolds and instrument stands for this work were necessarily so very high that it was out of the question to build separate instrument stands and observing platforms. In every case except at Langley the instrument stand and observing platform were bmlt together. In occupying these stations extreme care in observing was necessary, and observations were often prevented by the swaymg of the platform caused by wind. The highest scaffold occupied with the instrument was the station at La Push, 187 feet above the ground. There were two light stands higher than this, Moclips 213 feet, and Copalis 190 feet above ground. These two stations were concluded points in the main scheme. The scaffolds built were of several types, varying from those in the top of a single large tree without braces or guys, to those built in the top of one large tree with two or more trees of about the same height pull~d against it for support after they had been sawed and notched at the bottom. There was also the usual tripod for the instrument with an observing platform built on a separate structure free from the instrument stand. From experience it was found that where the instrument stand and observing platform must be built together the best type is one tree braced by two or more trees of about the same height drawn against it.

The method used in climbing these trees was to drive in 14-inch spikes similar to those used on telegraph poles, one above the other about 18 inches apart. In driving these spikes, a man s~anding on one spike hooks his safety belt over the next one above and drives the third at about the height of his head.

At the beginning of the fiscal year work was in progress on the line of precise levels between Butte, Mont., and Pasco, '\Vash., which had been extended westward of Missoula, Mont., to Plains, Mont. After July 1 this line was continued to a point about 25 miles west of Sand Point, Idaho. '\Vork on the line :from Butte to Pasco was then suspended for a period of over a month, during which time the line was extended from Sand Point to Port Hill. '\Vork on this line was completed September 15, and work on the line Butte to Pasco was resumed on September 16 from Rathdrum, ldaho. The line Butte to Pasco follows throughout its entire length the line of the Northern Pacific Railway. It is necessary to give a list of towns along the line of levels in order that the particular line of railroad followed may be identified, as there are several places where two lines of railway run between the same points by different routes. The line of leveling passes through Silver Bow, Deer Lodge, Drummond, Missoula, D~ Smet, F:renchtoym, St. Regis, Paradise, Plains, Thompson F1tlls, K1ldee, Clulds, Trout Creek, Noxon, Clark Fork, Koott-nai, Sand Point, Athol, Ramsey, Rathdrum, Spokane, Marshall, Cheney, Ritzville, Cunningham, Connell and Pasco. The line from Butte to Pasco connects with standard bench marks of the Coast and Geocletic Survey precise-level net at Silver Bow, Mont., and Pasco, 1Vash. At :frequent intervals throughout its entire length, the line touches upon bench marks of the United States Geolog1~al Survey and the profiles of the railway engineers. Motor wlocipede cars were used on the Butte-Pasco line during 2~ months and hand velocipedes during the remaining period. The rate of progress for the whole season on the line Butte-Pasco averaged 97.42 miles per month.

In March a line of precise levels 13.5 miles in length was run for the purpose of determining the elevations of triangulation stations Lutz near Charleston, Ind., and Louisville North Base, near Louisville, Ky. The line of levels was begun at bench mark No. 86 of the precise level net. This bench mark JS situated at the corner of Main and Eleventh Streets in the city of Louisville, and its elevation in the 1912 adjustment of the precise level net is 138.481 meters. The elevation of this bench mark was checked on bench mark No. 9:4, established by the War Department on the sea wall at the head of Portland Canal in the city of Louisville. The elevation of Louisville North Base was determined by a line extending from bench mark No. 28 of the Louisvme Sewer Commission. This bench mark was established by an engineer detailed from the United States Geological Survey to the engineering department of the city of Louisville.

Precise leveling on the line from Reno to Las Vegas, Nev., was benun May 20 and continued until the end of the fiscal year. l'he line was carried from Reno via Curson City to Mound House over the tracks of the Virginia & TruckeeиRailway, and from there via Churchill to Gillis, Nev., over the Southern Pacific Railroad. The weather was generally fair and warm. A considerable amount of rerunning was necessary on the heavy grades. The railroad officials manifested a great interest in the work and assisted the party whenever there was an opportunity. At 'Vabuska and Schurz connections were made with bench marks of the United States Geological Survey. Motor and hand velocipede railway cars were used in this work. The total progress made was 121 miles in 1-! months, or at the rate of about 90 miles per month, and the total number of permanent bench marks established was 64. The bench mark used was a wrought-iron pipe spread at the bottom to give a good bearing and carrying a standard bronze cap on the top.

SUMMAUY oF l!ESULTs.-Lutltude: 25 Jutitude stations occupied.

Between .July 1 and October 23 work was continued on the determination of latitudes at stations on or near the Texas-California arc of primary triangulation and on the Cnlifornia-'Nevada boundary. Of the 37 stations occupied during the entire season, beginning April 23, 6 were in western Texas, 5 in New Mexico, 14 in Arizona and 9 on the California-Nevada boumlary. By including stations of the U. S. Geological Survey and the Cnlifornia-Nevada boundary survey in the scheme a much better distribution of stations was secured than could have been obtained otherwise. 'Vherever stations were available, observations for latitude were made at points from 35 to 40 miles apart, but in many places the distances necessarily exceeded that amount. Although during July the 'weather was unfavorable for observations, from August 1 to the close of the season only three nights were lost on account of unfavorable weather. The rate of progress, therefore, depended only upon transportation and the roads. During August eight stations were occupied and 726 miles traveled. This completed all stations in Arizona but one nnd included one station in southern California. The remaining three stations in

California, Cuyamaca, San Jacinto, and Butte, were taken up in the order named. At San Jacinto it was necessary to transport the instrumental outfit on pack horses 18 miles from Idyllwild to the summit of San Jacinto Mountain, 10,830 feet above sea level. The next station, Butte, 35 miles north of Imperial Junction, could only be reached over a trail on which the sand was so heavy that the motor truck could not be used, and a four-horse team had to be substituted. Butte marked the completion of the observations along the TexasCalifornia arc of triangulation. There remained the stations on the oblique boundary between California and Nevada, and it was thought best to begin at the Lake Tahoe end and work southenstwardly. This not only ga\'e better weather for the work in the mountains at the north end but also gave the advantage of transportation from higher to lower altitudes. The run of 630 miles from Los Angeles to Carson City was made in six days, September 18 to 24, and observations were finished at two of the boundary stations before the end of the month. During September 5 stations were occupied and 1,270 miles traveled, and during the first 16 days of October the 8 remaining stations were completed. иwork was closed for the season on October 23. Observations for latitude were made in an observing tent with zenith telescope No. 4, mounted on a portable observing stand of aluminum. From 15 to 18 pairs of stars were observed ut a station, the Horrebow-Talcott method being employed. Owing to the necessity of pucking the instrumental outfit on the backs of the men to the summits of most of the mountains, the weight to be carried was reduced to the lowest possible limit. The observing tripod of aluminum alloy, weighing only 48 pounds, was especially constructed for this work and was used with great success. As it was, the average weight of the packs was 75 pounds per man. The 1!-ton autotruck used in the previous season was overhauled and some changes made in its equipment and gearing at the beginning of the season. The road conditions in eastern Arizona and southern California иwere generally good, but in the remaining sections they were so bad as to test the capacity of this means of transportation very severely. The truck was run more than 5,000 miles during the season und only about two hours were lost in nll on account of engine trouble. . The use of a lighter truck is recommended on account of its superior advantages in running through heavy sand and mud and in passing over weak bridges. The saving effected by the use of the truck as compared with horses and wagons is estimated at about 35 per cent in money and 50 per cent in time.

for horizontal measures, 4 geograph!r positions determined. Astronomic work : 4 latitude stations occupied, average of 15 pairs of stars observed at euch station, 8 telegraphic longitude stntlons occupied, signals exchanged on 45 nights.

In the latter part of June, 1914, instructions were issued for the determination by two cooperating observers of the difference of longitude between Washington, D. C., Far Rockaway, N. Y., and Cambridge, Mass., and preparations for starting work were begun, but no field work was done until July. This work was planned to afford a connection be.tween the Coast and Geodetic Survey longitude net and the end of a cable at Far Rockaway, :for the purpose of comparing a proposed trans-Atlantic cable determination of the difference of longitude between Borkum, Germany, and Far Rockaway, with previous trans-Atlantic longitude determinations us well as with such determinations as might be made in the future. Hence, a high degree of accuracy was required, and it was decided to exchange observers on each line and to secure four or five nights' observations each way. The method followed by the observers of the Prussian Geodetic Institute was adopted as nearly as was practicable. Three time sets were observed each night with an exchange of arbitrary signals between each two, thus giving two almost mdependent determinations of longitude each night. Each time set consisted of 5 to 7 time stars and an azimuth star. The time stars were all nearly in the zenith so that no azimuth factor was greater than 0.3 and the algebraic sum of the factors for all the time stars of a set less than 0.3. A preliminary catalogue of 6,188 stars by Lewis Boss was used :for the selection of stars and also for the star places. The stars for a time set were taken as rapidly as consistent with deliberate observations. As each star was observed both direct and reversed to eliminate the effects of collimation and pivot inequality, it had to be taken .a minute or more away from the meridian on each side, thus causing the selection of stars with intervals of little less than 4 minutes. The time required for a time set was therefore about 35 minutes. The instruments used for this work were quite different from any previously used in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and several days were required to get them properly fitted up and put in condition and to enable the observers to become familiar with the method of using them. An observatory was erected at Far Rockaway to be used jointly by the. observers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and by the German observers. At the United States Naval Observatory permission was given to use the observatory erected the year before :for occupation by the French observers who were making the determination of the difference of longitude between Washington and Paris by wireless telegraphy. As the Coast and Geodetic Survey observers used the same pier as the French observers, which was only 7 meters distant from the one occupied by the observers of the Naval Observatory on the same work, the Coast and Geodetic Survey results should be directly coml?arable with their work without the introduction of station deflect10ns at this end.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The instruments were mounted at the Na val Observatory early in July, but owing to continuously unfavorable weather, both at Washington and Far Rockaway no exchange of signals was obtained until August 1. On August 15 the fifth night of complete exchanges was obtained and the observations on the line from Far Rockaway to Cambridge were taken up. Exchanges between Far Rockaway and Cambridge were completed September 24. At each of the three stations the use of clocks was obtained for the chronograph record, thus eliminating the uncertainties due to the use of chronometers. At the Na val Observntory the standard Riefier sidereal clock was used. At Cambridge the exclusive use of the standard sidereal clock of Harvard University was obtained, and at Far Rockaway, except during the first part of the first line, direct connection was had with a Dencker sidereal clock set up by the German observer in a room in.the cable house. During the first exchange of observers, latitude observations were made at Far Rockaway with the new transit. Observations were also made to determine the value of the micrometer screw and of the latitude levels of this instrument. During the same period a trigonometric connection was made between the astronomic station and the triangulation of Greater New York. One of the trinngulation stations in Far Rockaway was recovered from which four other points could be seen. By establishing two new stations a point was located on top of the cable building and this point was connected with the astronomic station by a small triangle. These stations were placed on the tops of high buildings. During the second exchange of observers a trigonometric connection was made between the transit pier and the large dome at the Harvard Observatory, which is the point of reference for longitudes. A tracing was also made of a map showing the relative positions of the various buildings on the grounds of the observatory and showing elevations with contours. The observations on the Cambridge-,Vashington line were begun October 1 and completed October 11. The observers then exchanged places and were ready for work on October 15. However, rain prevented observations until October 21, when three consecutive clear nights were obtained with satisfactory results, and work was then closed. After the completion of the longitude work on the WashingtonFar Rockaway-Cambridge circuit, differences of longitude were determined as follows: Little Rock, Ark., to Germantown, Tenn.; Germantown, Tenn., to Strickland, Miss.; Strickland, Miss., to Madison, Ala.; Madison, Ala., to Nash ville, Tenn. The first and last of these are stations in the primary longitude net of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. In addition the difference of longitude was determined between Nash ville and 0 & M, a triangulation station near Charleston, Ind. This work was completed by January 13. On this southern work no stars were used except those given in the American Ephemeris. The method recently followed by the Survey and described in Special Publication No. 14 was followed on this work .with only a slight modification. Chronometers were used, and as the temperature was about freezing their rates were large, one of them being about 10 seconds per day. Breaks for aroi-

trary signals were made in unison with the swings of a pendulum as when working with clocks instead of chronometers. At all new stations on the southern work the pier for the support of the transit was constructed of wooden timbers set in the ground to a depth of from 2! to 3 feet. By the use of such a pier u considerable saving in time and expense was effected, and the stability of 1.he instrument was found to be quite as good as on any masonry 'pier and better than on a new concrete pier. The free use of the wires of the "'\Vestern Union Telegrnph Co. was granted on this work as previously, the Survey paying only for t.he extra connections and services of the operators on nights when observations were made. The accuracy in the results obtained with the new instruments is greater than with any instruments previously used in the Survey.

During January, 1915, a complete restandardization of the pendulums used in gravity work was made at the base station in the basement of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Building at Washington, D.C. The new values of pendulums B 5 and B 0 were found to agree remarkably well with their former values, whereas that of B 4 had changed considerably. The irregularities of this pendnlum had been previously noted. When, with the beginning of field work, its period was found to have changed again, this pendulum was returned to the office and the other two were used at the stations occupied, an extra swing being made at each station with one or the other of these pendulums. From experience during the previous season it appeared that th~ greatest error in the determination of gravity was due to inability to secure absolutely accurate temperature values. Investigations were made of thermographs which couldи be adapted to the pendulum cases, but no definite result was reached. For temporary improvement of the existing conditions, temperature jackets were devised consisting of heavy walls of three-ply felt, lined with canvas, and covered with leather. They were made to fit snugly against the case and to cover it completely, being provided with plugs for covering holes and openings which had to be exposed at certain times for making the necessary observations and reading.:> and in operating the pendulums. .By the use of these jackets more stable temperature conditions inside the case were obtained. Field work was begun on February 6, 1915, and concluded on May 22, 1915. During this time 11 statl.ons were occupied, the averag0 time at each station being 8 days. One of these stat10ns was occupieиl twice, a slight change of location having been found necessary after the first occupation. The stations occupied were Richmond, Emporia, and Bristol, Va.; Greenville, Wilmin_gton, Charlotte, Winston-Salem, and Asheville, N. C.; Cheraw, S. C.; and Cleveland and Knoxville, Tenn.

To carry out a series of gravity observations at stations in the Middle Western States, the work of standardizing the B set of pen<lulums was undertaken at the base station at the Coast and Geodetic Survey office at "Washington in July, 1914. Besides obtaining standard values of the periods of the pendulums at иwashington for use in computing relative gravity at the field stations, this standardization was designed to test the possibility of using on the field the noon time signals sent out by the Naval Observatory over the telegraph lines for rating the chronometers, instead of making local astronomic observations which had hitherto been employed in gravity determinations. With this end in view separate sets of observations were made with each of the methods.

The results obtained indicated a very close agreement and justified the use of the telegraphic time signals at all stations. The field season extended from August 18 to November 27, 1914. There were 86 working days and in that time 12 stations were occupied, 1!,am.ely, Parkersburg, vV. Va.; Colu?1bus, Ohio; Ind~anapolis, Ind.; ~prmgfield, Ill.; Lebanon, Mo.; J oplm, Mo.; Fort Sm1th, Ark.; Little Hock, Ark.; Hot Springs, Ark.; Texarkana, Ark.; Alexandria, La.; and Laurel, Miss. The average time for occupation of a station was days. Besides the regular gravity work it was necessary to make astronomic observations for latitude at four stations, Indianapolis, Lebanon, Alexandria, and Laurel. At each station the elevation of the pendulum above sea leYel was also determined. The mean value of the probable error of obserYed gravity at any station was between 0.001 and 0.0015 dyne. Changes were noted in the period of one of the pendulums, making it necessary to eliminate the results with this pendulum from the final computations of the values of gravitv. The new method of using 'Vestern Uni'on time has considerably reduced the cost of the work. 'Vhereas, formerly, two officers were engaged on gravity determinations now only one is required. There is also considerable saving in tra,nsportation, in the elimination of observatories, and in time formerly lost on account of bad weather.

JtESULTs.-GrnYity determinations: 11 pendulum stations oc-

cupied.

Between August 30 and December 2 gravity observations were made at Hockland, Me.; Chatham, Mnss.; Lanci\ster, N. H.; Bridgehampton, 'Vhitehall, Albany, Little Falls, Watertown and Southport, N. Y.; Atlantic City, N. J.; and Erie, Pa. Before actual field observations were begun, the A set of pendulums was standardized at the office in 'VMihington, with C. H. Swick assisting in the work. The standardization was made with time signals sent from the NaYal Observatory over the wires of the 'Vestern Union Telegraph Co., and also with local time observations on the stars. The probable errors of the results showed the time by telegraph to be in every way satisfactory for the gravity work. An electric light was substituted for the oil lamp in the flash apparatus. This light was placed inside, thus making the whole flash apparatus more compact and simple. Dnring this season the thermometers and manometers were carried by hand in small cases constructed for that purpose. и The averuge time for the completion of one station was 8.6 days, including Sundays. The total cost for the 11 stations occupied was $566.80, or an avera~e cost of $51.54 per station, not including observer's salary or mstrumental equipment. A compnrison with previous results shows a. reduction of more than two-thirds in the cost of determining relative intensity of gravity with the present methods.

The regular work of the Cheltenham magnetic observatory was continued during the year. This includes the operation of two magnetographs andи a seismograph, absolute observations for declination, dip, and horizontal intensity, sun observations for time, the scaling of hourly ordinates from the magnetograms and the computation of the absolute observations, and of the base-line values for both magnetographs. Beginning with January 1, l!H5, the practice was adopted of integrating the curves on the magnetograms instead of reading the ordinates at the exact hour of local mean time. Instruments used in the field work were standardized as usual. A new magnetometer of the India Survey type, made for the Survey by Cooke & Sons, of York, En(J'land, which had been compared at the Kew Observatory before shipment to the United States was standardized at Cheltenham in February and March, thus furnishing a comparison between the Kew and Cheltenham standards. In ,June a magnetometer and earth inductor belonging to the Carnegie Institution of 'Vashington were compared with the standard observatory instruments. The largest magnetic storm recorded since 1909 occurred June 16 to 18, 1915.

The work of the Tucson magnetic observatory was continued throughout the year. The magnetograph and seismograph "иere kept in continuous operation except for a few short breaks in the record of the horizontal intensity variometer. Absolute observations of declination, dip, and horizontal intensity were made twice a week, the hourly ordinates were scaled from the magnetograms, and the base-line values were computed. Meteorological observations were ma<le daily and the results reported to the.local office of the иweather Bureau. и The magnetic storm beginning June 16 was the largest recorded since the establishment of the observatory in 1909. The number of earthquakes recorded during the year was 39. PonTo Rrno.

At the magnetic observatory at Vieques, P. R., the mngnetograph and seismograph were kept in operation with slight interruptions throughout the year. Absolute observations were made twice each week, a double set of horizontal intensity, a set of dip observations, and two sets of declinations comprising the day's work. Scale-value observations were made at least once each month. Time observati<;ms were made about once in 10 days. Few earthquakes were recorded during the year and these were of small intensity.

иwire-drag work in Sumner Strait, Alaska, was begun May 19, 1915. The plan adopted was to begin in the latitude of Bluff Island and work northward, including the investigation of a spot on the west side of the strait off Point Amelius where a depth of 8 fathoms was shown on the chart. A dangerous pinnacle rock was located in the fairway between Calder Rocks and Barrier Rocks which is used by all vessels stopping at ports on the west coast of Prince of "\Vales Island and by the regular passenger boats when calling at Shakan cannery. There is but 15 feet over this rock at extreme low tides. In the vicmity of the 8-fathom sounding, on the west-central side of the strait, a pinnacle with 25 feet at extreme low waters was found, rising sharply from depths of 27 and 30 fathoms. In the entrance to Shakan Bay nine uncharted shoals were discovered~ with least depths ranging from 24 to 54 feet. . The area completed to June 30 is as follows: First, an area covering 7 square miles, three miles southeast of Point Amelius, vicinity of the 8-fathom sounding on chart 8200, on the west side of Sumner Strait. Second, un area cov~ring 7 square miles extending off the east side of the strait to longitude 133░ 43' and including a strip off the west side of Calder Rocks. The southern limit of this area is at latitude 56░ 07', about one-half mile north of Bluff Island, and the northern limit is at latitude 56░ 21' just south of Point Baker. All of this area was drugged to an effective depth of 50 feet, except that inside the entrance to Shakan Bay, which 'was dragged to a depth of 40 feet. As control for the drag work five old triangulation stations established in 1886 were recovered and used. Twenty-six new signals were built and located. A topographic sheet was made in order to locate certain si(J'nals and to determine the true position of Barrier Islands. The cl~arted position of these islands had been reported to be in error. An automatic tide gauge was esta?Iished in Port Protection on May 28 and kept in continuous operat10n. A tide staff was set in the entrance to Shakan Bay and connected with the automatic gauge by comparatirn readings. On June 28, during the spring tidal flow, the direction and velocity of the currents in this part of Sumner Strait were observed. Photographic views were obtained of the wreck of the steamer Delhi in Sumner Strait. This steamer went ashore on the south end of Strait Island in January, 1915. The cause of the wreck is commonly attributed to the strong nnd swirling currents in Sumner Strait which put the vessel off her course, and to the thick weather which shut out the land.

The party organized in ,June for wire-drag work in southeastern Alaska arrived at Ketchikan early in ,July with the chartered launches Chehalis, Arnold, and Vil.:ing. The preparation and assembling of the "иire-drag apparatus was completed and work with the drag was begun by July 18. The necessary signals had predously been erected in Tongass Narrows northward of Ketchikan where the first work was done. A tide gauge was established at the cannery dock in 'Vard Cove and tides were obserYed there whenever work was being done northwestward of Ketchikan. On August 22 instructions were received to continue work to the southward and eastward for the remainder of the season. Accordingly, u tide gauge was established at Hassler Harbor on Annette Island. The old tidal bench marks at that place were also recovered. Hassler Harbor proYed to have excellent holding ground and safe shelter from southeasterly gales. In Revillagigedo Channel between Spire Island and Mary Island the shore line shown on the charts was found to be considerably in error, especially off t.he entrance to Thorne Arm. A projection was made and the shore lme was partly rerun. Between October G and 9 a wire-drag examination wus made of Metlakatla Harbor and its approaches. Work was closed for the season on October 10. The triangulation in Tongass Narrows consisted only in the recovery and reoccupation of stations for the location of signals. All stations recovered were re-markt>d where found in bad condition. The magnetic station on Pennock Island was located and the new wireless towers recently erected nortlnvest of Ketchikan "иere determined. Signals for use in Nichols Passage had been built and located by the party on the steamer JlfcArthur. In Revillagigedo Channel a small scheme of tertiary triangulation was curried from Mary Island to Mountain Point and Pennock Island, sta1ting from a line of the 1914 triangulation in Felice Strait the main scheme was carried to Pennock Island and connected with the work brought through Nichols Passage, making a complete scheme of triangulation around Annette Island. It was also connected with the work of 1910 in Tonguss Narrows. The object of the hydrographic work done was to verify a clear depth of 45 feet below mean low water in all areas where that depth was charted and to verify all soundings of less depth within the urea examined in the probable path of navigation. In Tongass Narrows from Guard Island to Mountain Point, including the south channel, the examination was Yery thorough, much cure being taken to locate uny points protruding from the shore to a less depth than charted. Throughout this urea the drag bouts run to within a few feet of the kelp line on each side of the channel. In Nichols Pussuge the unusually strong tides in the neighborhood of Walden Rocks made the suney difficult. As in Tonguss Narrows the work was carried close to the shore, and care was taken to locate

96

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

rocks near the beach. The area dragged extends to a line about 2! nautical miles south of Walden Rocks. In Revillagigedo Channel the shore line was not approached so closely as in the narrower channels, the object being more to insure the safety of the main fairways rather than to locate rocks near the beach line. In this region the area was covered more rapidly than in Tongass Narrows. It was demonstrated here that very rapid progress can be made in wide channels, generally clear, but with occasional pinnacle rocks. In this channel the work was extended to a line from Twin Islands to Alava Point, including the passage north of Bold Island ancl Thorne Arm for a distance of about 21 nautical miles. The survey -in Port Chester was to verify shoal soundings near the entrance to the harbor discovered by the party on the steamer AfcArthur in the progress of a regular hydrogruphic survey. A thorough examination of the harbor and entrance was made, the examined area extending from abreast Cedar Point to within half a mile of Driest Point and east of Warbuton Island and Kelp Rocks buoy. The entire surrny was made in four working days. The experience gained in this season shows that kelp is not a serious obstacle to wire-drug work, but the drug can not be towed over kelp against the tidal current. In Tongass Narrows two new wharves in 'Vard Cove and three uncharted wharves at Ketchikan were located. In Revillagigedo Channel the shore line was carefully sketched in and one day's work with the plane table was done near the entrance to Thorne Arm. Two tide stations were established, one at иward Cove and the other at Hassler Harbor, and observations were made on staff gauges. Automatic gauges were maintained during the season at Ketchikan and Metlakatla. At the latter place 10-minute observations were taken upon the staff during the hours when work was being done. During the season 21 dangers were discovered of importance to navigators in Tongass Narrows, Nichols Passage, Revillagigedo Channel, and Port Chester. Of these the most important were a 7-foot pinnacle rock off Vullenar Point, in Tongass Narrows; a 19foot pinnacle rock near the north shore; a 3-foot pinnacle rock near East Clump Light; a 26-foot pinnacle rock near the New England Fish Co.'s dock. In Revillagigedo Channel a 13-foot pinnacle rock near Spire Island Light; a 5-foot rocky patch in same locality; a 26-foot rocky patch in the entrance to Hassler Harbor; a 15-foot pinnacle rock in the same locality; a 17-foot pinnacle rock near the entrance to Thorne Arm; and a sounding of 26 feet off Hog Rocks. In Port Chester a 10!-foot sounding on shoal near Kelp Rocks Buoy discovered by steamer McArthur. Wire-drag work was resumed May 12, 1915, in Revillagigedo Channel southeast of Ketchikan from the limits of the 1914 work to the British Columbia boundary line. A tide gauge was established at Hassler Harbor and later on one at Kah Shakes Cove in the entrance to Boca de Quadra. From May 11 to the end of the fiscal year dragging was in progress whenever the weather permitted. On June 21 reconnoissance and signal building were begun in Clarence Strait.

The triangulation done consisted in subsidiary work only, the main scheme stations being all recovered. The positions of lights on Lord Rocks, Mary Island, and Tree Point were determined and other points were located for control of the hydrography. Reconnoissance and signal building in Clarence Strait were carried from Guard Island to Point Lemesurier. The topography coYers the entrance to Boca de Quadra and the shore line in H.eYillagigedo Channel from this entrance to Foggy Bay. A reconnoissance of this locality showed almost no detail, and that a large inlet leading 3 or 4 miles back from Foggy Bay, and known as Very Bay was not included on the charts. The hydrography consisted in sweeping with a wire drag all areas in the main ship channel between Twin Islands and Cape Fox and tho entrance to Boca de Quadra. The exposed nature of this channel made work possible only in the best weather. A 10,000foot drag proved satisfactory for the open work. Several rocks and rocky reefs were discovered, inYestigated or determined in position before the close of the fiscal year, but in general the area examined was found to be free from dangers.

Progress made in the surveys of the main ship channels on the west coast of Prince of 'Yules Island, Alaska, prior to July 1, 1914-, is mentioned in the lust annual report. At the beginning of the fiscal year the general sur\иey of Trocadero Bay and Klawnk Inlet was in progress. The triangulation of Trocadero Buy was completed prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. The topography of the whole of Trocudero Bay wn.s completed August 8. The hydrography of the buy was done with the Cosmos and launch No. 117, and was completed August 22. The main channels to the Copper Mine were dragged and a careful de\'elopment was made of suspicious soundings. The avera~e number of soundings per square mile was 98, and 8.5 square miles were gone over with u wire drag. The soundings were reduced from readings on the tide gauge ut Craig. A small hydrpgraphic sheet was made southward of Craig and joining the work done in Trocudero Buy, and a close survey made of this locality where it is rumored thnt a wharf will be built. The triangulntion of Meares Passage was done by a detached party on the Cosmos and was completed August 21. The work extends from the triangulation by E. F. Dickins in 1907 in Ulloa Channel to Divers Island. The topography of this section is shown on one sheet on scale of 1: 20,000. The work extends from Juel Point on

the southeast to the limits of the sheet on the northwest. This work was done chiefly by a detached party on the Cosmos between August 14 and September 4. The hydrography of thi:> area was done by the Cosmos and launch No. 117, and is shown on one sheet completed between August 26 and September 7. Outside of the limits of this work are numerous places where breakers occur in heavy weather and which could not be examined in the time available. The topography of Sukkwan Strait was done on one sheet, scale 1: 10,000, between September 11 and 15, and joins the topography in Retta Inlet with that in Sukkwan Narrows. The hydrography done with launch No. 117 between September 12 and September 17 also joins previous work in Retta Inlet with that in Suklnvan Narrows. The sounding lines were spaced about 200 meters apart, being closer at the western end. The hydrography of the western approach to Sukkwan Strait was ddne between September 13 and September 18 by the Cosmos and launch No. 117. This sheet connects the work in Sukkwan Strait "иith that in Tlevak Strait. The work was not carried south of Corlies Islands nor eastward into the north pass of Sukkwan Strait. Sounding lines were spaced about 200 meters apart. Several shoals were found and thoroughly developed. The topography of Revillagigedo Channel from Cone Point to Safety Cove was done while the Gedney was undergoing repairs at Ketchikan as the result of damage done by the steam whaler Star I I I. A wire drag was fitted. up on b?urd the Gedney to supplement the work done by the soundmg parties. Launches No. 117 and No . .137. were used to tow the drug. The work assigned to the Gedney of surveying the main ship channels on the west coast of Prince of 'Wales Island, the development and marking of n. good inside channel from Tonowek Bay to Sea Otter Sound, and the survey of Meares Pass, an approach from the sea, was completed during the season which closed September 30. The commanding officer of the Gedney recommends that this re{?:ion be thoroughly examined with the wire drug. The following is quoted from his report:
From my one year's experience in th!;; vicinity I doubt If there Is any bocly of water which requires to be gone ovPr with u wire drug more than these narrow channels. 'l'o get goocl contours of the bottom with the hnnll lead alone Is more difficult urn! unsatisfactory than the development of the sky line of New York or nuy !urge city would be If mncle by dropping u lencl from nn altи vessel, which might possihly Jund on ll church steeple, but most likely would give no indication of its existence. It was my encleuvor to keep the quality of the work done this yeur up to the hi::;h stunclurcl of the work rireviously <lone In this vicinity but even with a .very close i,;ystcm of lines nncl development of all Indications, there undoubtedly exist some dungers which huve not been located, und their presence eau only be Iorntecl by the use of the wire drug.

The Gedney left Seattle April 29 to resume work in Alaska, arriving at Ketchikan Muy 3 and at Metlakatla.May 4. At the latter place repairs were made to the launch Cosmos and boats. Field work was begun May 15 on the topography of Ulloa Channel which was completed from the limits of the work of the Gedney in 1913 to a junction with the work of the same vessel in 1914. This completes the topography along the main ship channels on the west coast of Prince of Wales Island.

The triangulation was extended from the line Baptiste-Floris of 1907 to Cape Bartolome and Cape Felix. The reconnoissance in Bucareli Bay to locate signals for the determination of Capes Lookout and Augustine, Forrester Island, and 'Volf Rock was completed. Many interisection stations were compnted for the control of the topography. Besides the work previouslv mentioned, the topography of the eastern shore of Bucareli Bay~ from that of the previous season to Cape Felix (with the exception of Port Dolores), n small piece of shore around Cape Cocos (Ignace Island), and the whole western shore of Bncareli Bny from Copones Bay south to Cape Bartolome (with the exception of Port San Antonio) has been completed. There remained at the end of June only about 2! milrAc; of shore line to join this work with that of the previous season in :Menres Passage. The hydrography of Bucareli Bny wns completed from about 1 mile south of the work by the Gedney during the previous season to a lizie nearly dne west of the southern entrance of Port Santa Cruz and San Antonio. The inshore hydrography approximntely out to the 100-fathom curve was developed by lines spaced 150 meters apart, with soundings not exceeding 1:)0 meters apart and in most cases much Jess. Between the 100-fathom curves on each side of the bay the maximum distance between lines and soundings was 300 meters, with closer development where shoals were found. Below Point Arboleda the lines and soundings were spaced not mol'e than 250 meters apart with closer development over shoals. The entrance nnd bay of Port Asmncion was developed with lines and soundings not more than 100 meters apart, and closer where there were shoal indications.

The survey of Nichols Passage and Felice Strnit, southeastern Alaska, by the party on the steamer ll!cArthur was in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year. After June 30 the triangulation was extended into Felice Strnit, but "иeather conditions so delaved work that the observations were not completed nntil August The triangulation in Felice .Strait began on the line Ken to Lazaro (1912), nntl extended through five qundrilaterals to the line Ham to S. Twin '(1895). Signals at Ken and Lazaro were standing and tlfo marks at Hnm una S. Twin were recovered. Station Ken is at an elevation of 1,200 feet, Lazaro 1,700 feet, Ronn<l 2,600 feet, and the other stations arc neur tidewater. The line Ken to Round is 25.8 miles in length, and

Ken to Lazaro is 25.2 miles in length. In this scheme 13 triangulation stations were occupied. This scheme covered Hl7.7 square miles. The topographic work of the season covers the cast shore of Gravina Island from Gravina Point to Dall Head, the west and south shores of Annette Island from Wal den Point to Indian Rock, Hotspur Island, and the greater part of Percy Islands. The work done after .June 30 is included on three topographic sheets on a scale of 1: 20,000. Before July 1 sounding had been completed in Port Chester and the greater part of Blank Inlet, and the sounding extended into Nichols Passage from 'Valden Hocks to Bostwick Inlet. Hydrographic work was continued after June 30 throughout Nichols Passage, around Port Davidson, and along the northern side of Felice Strait to Indian Rock. Soundings were spacecl over the entire area with an average of 93 soundings to the square mile. Depths varied from 265 fathoms to shoal soundings inshore. The launch Delta with a Cosmos hand-sounding machine was used in depths up to 100 fathoms. In Felice Strait particular attention was giYen to the channel between Annette Island on the northern side and Ajax Reef, Wallace Reef and Snipe Island on the southern side, and finally the channel was swept with a wire clrag to assure a depth of 22 feet at low water. Ship hydrography coYered the approach to Nichols Passage and Felice Strait. Soundings ure deep and widely scattered. Automatic tide gauges were maintained during the season at Ketchikan and Metlakatla and staff readings were taken at Hotspur Island. Magnetic observations with compass declinometer were made at five triangulation stations. Current observations were made in Port Chester, off the north end of Hotspur Island and off the southeast end of Annette Island. The current station at Ilotspur Island was a little inshore of the strongest current. The ebb current on the spring tides runs from 3 to 4 knots off I~Iarris li;;land and 3 to 5 knots between Snipe Island and Annette I>oint. и Wire-drag work was done in the ship channel in Felice Strait and off Point Davidson. In Felice Strait the drag set to an effective depth of 22 feet was taken through the ship channel south of Annette Island and beyond Indian Rock. Off Point Davidson a shoal with 45 feet was found where previous soundings showed 13 fathoms. In November an investigation was made of a reported danger off River Point, Portland Canal, Alaska. In the fall of 1913 the master of the cannery tender /Jidden Inlet reported that some years before while fishing off Hiver Point, Portland Canal, about mid-channel, a fish line grounded at about 4 fathoms and that he considered the place to be very near the 112-fathom sounding shown on the chart between River Point and иwhite Point. Signals were erected and determined in position, a tide staff erected and connected by leveling with a permanent bench mark erected for the purpose, and tides were observed hourly during the day from November 2 to November 6. In order to establish with certainty the existence or nonexistence of the reported danger the channel was dragged with a long wire. A

section of 1,800 feet of drag, with two large encl buoys und 1G5-pound weights, und 4 small buoys with 20-pound weights together with the necessary uprights, towing bridles, etc., was obtained for the purpose. This drag was set at the maximum depth, nearly G3 feet, and was towed through the channel for a distance of 1 mile on either side of the position of the reported danger without encountering any obstacle. The greatest range of tide "иas 18 feet and the drag proved that there was no danger at a depth of 40 feet below the lowest water. The drag passed to within 218 yards of River Point, and on the Canadian side the drag was towed to within 100 yards of the beach between Raw Point and "White Cliff. On one line soundings were taken with Cosmos machine with a Basnett tube attached while the vessel was going ahead slowly towing the drag. In no case was there less than 100 fathoms. The ill cA rtlwr sailed from Seattle to resume work on the coast of Alaska on May 13, arriving at Metlakatla May 21. The next day the launch Delta was put in the water and towed to Ketchikan. The Delta was overhauled and repaired and a иnew boiler put in. An automatic tide gauge was erected in the meanwhile on the lighthouse dock at Ketchikan. On July 1 the party proceeded to Ryus Bay and began signal building and general surveying work. On June 8 two steam sounding engines, ordered for the Cosmos sounding machines, were received and their installation was at once begun. The regular type of Cosmos machine was provided with a ropedri ve pulley secured to the same shaft as the wire drum. A friction brake "иas secured to the framework and to brake against the inner rim of the wire drum. The frame of the Cosmos machine was bolted to an iron plate bedded against a 2-inch board. A threecylinder, self-contmned, Ingersoll-Hand steam engine, with a ro;pedrive pulley on shaft, was bolted to the same bed. A heavy idling wheel on a swing arm gives the tension to the rope drive. On the ship the machine is mounted abreast the bridge on the port side, and the sounding иwire leads from the drum throngh the sheave on the weighted end of a long arm. The tension of the lead on the arm holds the same out of vertical, and the arm swing'ing to a vertical position when the lend strikes bottom takes up the slack line until the brake is applied. The wire leads from the arm mentioned over a Ballauf regIStering sheave mounted on the ship's bridge, and thence over a fair-lead nt the end of a pipe davit to the water. The method of applying the power on the launch Delta was similar to that on the ship. The use of steam power on the sounding machine resulted in a considerable saving in time and labor. By .Tune 30 the hydrography had ~een 1~ractical!y completed in Sealed Passage and up to Ryus Bay m Felice Strait. The greater part of the offshore work intended to be done was completed. Submarine sentry lines were run in going to and returning from work. Soundings made in the reported position of Hassler Reef failed to indicate the existence of such a danger in that locality. The survey of the shore line of the Percy Island~. and o~ Duke Island from Ryus Bay to about 3 miles south of Pomt "White wns completed. The greater part of the Percy Islands already surveyed

was retraversed in locating signals for the hydrographic {arty. A topographic survey of Ryus Bay was made on a scale o 1 : 10,000 and the topography extended from Ryus Bay to Dog Bay. Only such triangulation stations were occupied as was necessary for the location of signals for the hydrography and topography. Tide observations with automatic gauge were made at Ketchikan and staff gauge readings were made at Uyus Bay. Compass declinomcter observations were- made at Seattle and J(etchikan. The ship was swung at Scuttle and at other points on the way north.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the party on the steamer T alcu was engaged in general surveys in the region of Passage Canal, Alaska. Upon the completion of that work on August 7 the general survey of Landlocked Bay was taken up and continued until the close of the season on September 23. The triangulation of Passage Canal had been completed in the previous June, and tide observations with an automatic gauge were being recorded at a station in Passage Bay. A base line had been measured across the flats at the head of Passage Canal and connected with the triangulation. After July 1 magnetic declination was observed at 6 triangulation stations in Passage Canal and Landlocked Bay, and at the magnetic station in Se,vnrd Park, Bailey Peninsula, Lake иwashington, 'Vash. The topography of Passage Canal was done on three sheets on a scale of 1: 10,000, and joins topography executed by the party on the Taku in 1913. A fourth sheet covers the north end of Culross Island, connecting with the work of 1912 and also the point of the mainland west of Culross Passage. The contour interval on these sheets is 10 feet to the 40-foot contour, and 100 feet above this elevation. In general, the timber line in the canal is at an elevtion of about 000 feet. The shore line in the canal in general is rocky and steep, with few outlying dangers. The hydrographic work is covered by three sheets. Sheet "A" covers the area between the survey of 1913 off Esther and Culross Islands, across the lower end of Port vVells, into the entrance of Passage Canal to Point Decision. Sheet "B" covers Passage Canal from Point Decision to connect with the hydrography executed in 1913 at Billings Delta. Sheet "C" covers the upper end of the Canal, and supplements the work of 1913 along the south shore, at the head, a11d O\'er the shoal between stations Ped and Saw. Passage Canal, together with its approach, Perry Island Passage and the south end of Port Wells, is a beautiful stretch of water, ranging in depth from 100 to 200 fathoms and in width from 1 to 2 miles.

The shores bordering these waters are steep '"ith 1Wactica1ly no outlying rocks, reefs, or hidden dangers of any kind. The land rises directly from the water to an elevation of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. These characteristics together with its lack of any strong surface currents, due to its great depth nnd broad expanse, render it an ideal channel for purposes of navigation. An automatic tide gauge was installed on ~V.и A. Dicky's wharf near the head of Landlocked Bay and a continuous record obtained from August 11 to September 25. The triangulation was carried to the head of Landlocked Bay from the line Pine-Fido. It was not practicable to use un old station on Copper Mountain Point. The only station found was on the Boulder Bay side of the point. While the triangulation was being carried into Landlocked Bay a scheme was taken up Port Fidalgo to Irish CoYe. Two triangulation stations at the entrance to Landlocked Bay were occupied for observations of magnetic declination. The topo~raphy of Landlocked Bay, on a scale of 1: 20,000, covers the shore line from Copper Mountain Point jnto Landlocked Buy and around the point at the entrance to Port Fidalgo. The contour interval is 100 feet. The shore included in the limits of the sheet is variable, in places steep-to and in others gradually receding, with offlying rocks and islands. The hydrographic work was done on a scale of 1: 20,000 and covers the area included between a line from Bidarka or иCopper ltfountain Point to the west point at the entrance to Port Fidalgo and all the shores bordering on Landlocked Bay. The main bay from Copper Mountain Point to the head of the narrow arm is clear except for a shoal in mid-channel at the entrance to the Xarrows on which the Lighthouse Service maintains a buoy. This shoal was closely developed and a least depth of 2-rr fathoms found. The head of the bay buck of the 'small islands is very shoal, generally bare at extreme low water. This urea was sounded over. The shores from the Narrows to the point at the entrance to Port Fidalgo is very foul, with off-lying rocks, reefs, and small islands. This area was sounded over, but no drag work was done. This bay varies in depth from 50 fathoms in the outer bay to 10 fathoms off Dicky's dock, gradually shoaling from the greater to the less depth. Good anchorage in 15 fathoms, mud bottom, is found in the broader part of the bay about halfway between the Narrows and the head. The party for the steamer J'alcu left Seattle on April 24 on the steamer Alameda to resume field operations in Alaska, arrivin~ at CordoYa, April 29. 'Vork was at once begun of preparing the 1 aku for service, on repairs and installation of the boiler and engines, and и painting the vessel, which occupied the time until June 3. On May 28 while the vessel was beached at Orea for painting and cleaning bottom, a local survey was made at Orea, locating the n~w dock at that place, and a few sounding lines were run in that vicinity. On June 4 work was begun in Comfort Cove, Port Gravina, where a camp was established for the topographic party and an automatic tide gauge was installed and put in operation. Signal building for the survey of Port Gravina was begun June 5 and completed June 25.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the steamer Explorer was engaged in the survey of Knik Arm, Cook Inlet, Alaska, having previously completed the survey of Excursion Inlet and Icy Passage, the hydrography of Glacier Bay, the location of whanes and cannery buildings at Hoonah and Idaho Inlet, and determined the position of a submerged rock in South Inian Pass. On arrival at Knik Arm it was found that the Alaskan Engineering Commission had just landed at Ship Creek, where they were to make their headquarters for the summer. The parties cooperated in making simultaneous tide obs~rvations at Cairn Point and Knik to enable the commission to obtam an approximate half-tide level from which to start lines of level into the interior. The party on the Explorer also assisted the commission in making a detaiiecl cross section off the mouth of Ship Creek, in order to determine the amount of dredgin~ necessary to construct a basin at that point. In this work the sounding was done by the Explorer. During the early portion of this work the shoals in the channel off Fire Island were located. The masters of vessels calling at Ship Creek were at once notified of the positions of these shoals, thus enah~ing them to pas;; thr~rng?. i~ safety. Two of these vessels had prev10usly grounded m this v1c1mty. On the mght of July 22 the Explorer rendered assistance to the steamer BertAa which was anchored at Ship Creek for use as a floating wharf. In a fresh wind and heavy current the Bertha began to drag and was being carried in to~ard the beach. Members of the crew of the Explorer aicled the crew of the Bertha in getting up their anchor which because of lack of steam they were obliged to heave up by hand. Some of the shore work in connection with this survev was exceedingly difficult. The head of the Arm was one vast mud flat, so that it was not feasible, because of the loss of time involved, to use boats for transportation in executing the triangulation and topography. The larger part of this work, therefore, had to be done on foot, workin~ from a centrally located camp. The officers and men engaged m this work were compelled to make long marches through mud, marsh, or undergrowth, tormented by myriads of mosquitoes, and worked at any hour of the day or night when the tide served. In topography, particularly, where it was impracticable to driYe them away by means of smudges, the mosquitoes proved such n torment

that the use of the plane tnble was abandoned and the shore line was run in with the sextant. Signals were located by triangulation or plane table along the cast side of the Arm all the way up to its head and these signals were subsequently used for sextant positions in running in the marsh at the head of the Arm and on the west side. и The work in Cook Inlet was completed on August 17 and on the same day the ship left for Prince 'Yilliam Sound, stopping en route nt Port Graham for coal and at Seldovia to investigate a reported shoaling iri the harbor there. The we.ck in Prince William Sound consisted of the hydrogruphy in the open area north of Montague Island and between Hmchinbrook and Smith Island: nn exammation of the bar between Cnlross , nd Esther Island; andи the hydrography between Perry and Lone Islands. On the principal work in this locality, namely, the hydrography north of Montagne Island and between Hinchmbrook and Smith Islands, it was possible to work only with the ship. On the fow days when work was possible sounding was continued without interruption :from daylight, or shortly after, until dark. The work was discontinued on September 28. On the return voyage the vessel stopped at Juneau "иhere the automatic tide gauge .installed on the dock of the Pacific Coast Steamship Co. was thoroughly overhauled and a new gauge installed. A hy<lrographic exummntion wus also made of the edge of the shoal flat off the mouth of Sheep Creek. The Explorer sailed from Seattle for Alaska May 29, 1915. Arrivjng at Juneau on .Jnne 3 an inspection was made of the automatic tide gauge there. The Explorer then proceeded to Seward arriving on June G. Here a supply of coal was taken on board and the vessel proceeded on her voyage, arriving ut Port Chatham about the center of the proposed field of operations on June 8. и At Port Chatham an automatic tide gauge was set UI) and immediately thereafter the work of reconnoisance, si~nal bui ding, and hydrography 'vas begun. For the offshore soundings various mountain peaks, determined by triangulation in previous years, were used us signals, and by June 30 the greater portion from Point Gore to the Barren Islands had been completed. These soundings were taken with Basnett tubes, an up and clown cast being taken eyery fifth sounding in order to furnish a check on the accuracy of the tubes.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Progress made in general surveys in the Shumagin Islands and along the coast of the Alaska Peninsula by the party on boar<l the steamer Patterson to June 30, 1914, is detailed in the last annual report. Work was continued until the close of the season in October in the same region, the work along the Alaska Peninsula extending us far eastward as Chignik and as far westward us Unimak Pass. The chartered schooner Hunter furnished supplies to the camp parties on the Shumagin Islands throughout the season. The Patterson also made two voyages into Bering Sea to transport the party of the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Yukon, and one voyage to Attu Island to the relief of the revenue cutter J'ahonia. On all of these voyages valuable hydrographic information was secured. The survey of the Shumagin Islands was continued by the schooner Hunter with one officer and six men employed on triangulation and hydrography. One baseиcamp was maintained \vith two officers and seven men employing a steam launch for hydrogruphy, and two topographic parties were operated with two officers and seven men, usmg motor dories and fishing dories for transportation. A reconnoissnnce and triangulation party was placed on the mainland, consisting of one officer and three men using a sailing boat. There remained on board the ship four officers and 24 men, und the time of the vessel was divided about equally between the mainland coast adjoining the Shumagins early in the season, and later in the season, Ummuk Pass and its southeastern approaches. The camp was visited once each month. In the Shumagin Islands the triangulation was not extended mucb. beyond the limits of the hydrography and topography. Three figures were completed to supplement the 1913 scheme, and many concluded points were located from new and old stations. The topography of the most important part o:f Nagai Island, comprising the northwestern coast to the northern point, and of Andronica and Korovin Islands, the Haystacks, and the southern and southwestern coasts of Unga Island, was completed. The topography remains slightly in advance of the hydrography and it was not considered advisable to advance it further. The work consisted entirely of plane-table traverses and the scale of 1: 20,000 was used. The entire land area was covered to the limits of the sheets and all elevations were dete'rmined. The hydrography covers nearl,Y the same portion of the coast as the topography. The two most important harbors on Nagai Island were surveyed and the entire northwest coast to a иconnection with the work around Popof and Unga Islands. Both approaches to иwest Nagai Strait, Gorman Strait, and Karovin Strait, the most frequented passes in the Shumagins, were covered. The southern coast of Unga Island was included, thus providing for the seaward approaches. The survey was on a scale of 1: 20,000. The work of this season is continuous at all points with the preYious one. All shore lines were carefully developed, and enlarged plans of four harbors were made, and many banks, shoals, and pinnacles were carefully examined. For general development lines were run at one-eighth mile intervals to 20 fathoms, one-fourth mile to 50 fathoms, one-third mile to 75 fathoms, and one-half mile to 100 fathoms. There were

few depths greater than 100 fathoms and the ruling depth was 30 fathoms. The hand lead was used to 20 fathoms an<l vertical casts with wire at greater depths. The Basnett pressure tube was used successfully by the Hunter for u. short time. There are many islands and passages in the eastern portion of the Shumagin Group which could not be surveyed this season as the hydrogruphy of this locality is slow and laborious. There is much broken ground and suspicions shoals are often met with; but this season's work, together with that of the previous season, covers all the waters commonly used, including an important portion of the track followed by a11 westward bound vessels which use the inside passage. The ship-met with much worse weather near Unimak Puss than in 1913. All of the volcanoes of the Alaska Peninsula were active and two violent eruptions occurred so that clear weather could scarcely be expected. 'Vhenever it was necessary to go to Unalaska a delay was made eastward of Unimak Pass to await fair 'veather, and in September 10 days were spent there, at the most promising season of the year. In this manner several valuable lines of soundings were obtained, and the reported bank off Cnpe Snrichef was found and developed. The ship passed several times over the reported locality of Lenard Rock and secured more soundings there, confirming the results of the previous season. On three occnsions it proved possible to carry the sounding line from the Shumagin Islands to Unimak Pass, once by the inside passage and once outside. T"иo lines of soundings were carried between Unimak Pnss nnd Qoodnews Bny. Thus, there are comprised in the season's work continuous lines of soundings from Goodnews Bay by way of Unimak Pass nnd the Shumagms to a point 90 miles northeastwnrd of the Slrnmagins, a distance of (;00 miles. The Bnssnett and the Tnnner-Blish pressure tubes were used on these lines, employing the usual precautions to verify the tubes, and the results were satisfactory. During the curly part of the senson the scheme of triangulation was carried from the Shumagin Islands to the mainland by the ship's party, an~ wns extended by a party from the ship along the coast of the penmsula to Kuiukta. Bay. I1ere it rests at the entrance to a valley leading to Chignik and the coast beyond. Fifteen new stations were established, forming five figures. This scheme advances the Unalaska datum DO miles along the coast of the Alaska Peninsnla. The obsening was done in accordnnce with the general instructions for tertiary triangulation, nnd the mean closure of the triangulation was four nnd one-half seconds. The stations are at elevations of 1,600 to 2,200 feet. Frequent concluded points were determined and marked on the ground, so that it is possible to proceed with the survey of this coast without further triangulation. Mountain peaks were determined as far as the crest of the Alaska Peninsula, which here is 5,000 to 8,000 feet high. Among these peaks is the active volcano of Veniaminof, 8,000 feet high. и A reconnoissance was carried along with the triangulation depending upon theodolite and sextant nngles, which shows the shore line and soundings on the usual vessel tracks on the scnle of 1: 100,000. The result is ample for nll ordinary needs of navigntion. Two harbors in this region were also surveyed with the plane table, and one

of them was partly developed by soundings. It is called Kupreanof Harbor, and is far the best hnrbor in all respects which exists in the whole region. A tide station and a magnetic station were established on it. Several important corrections were discovered here which will ussist in the navigation of the inside passage. Tw~ voyag-es were made t<~ Goodnews Bay and return. This took the ship u distance of 350 miles from Unalaska and 600 miles from the Shumagin Islands. The officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey schooner Yukon were transported to Goodnews Bay at the beginning of the season, and assistance was given in placing the Yukon in commission. At the end of the season the officers and crew of the Yukon were transported to Unalaska. Two lines of soundings were made between Unimak Pass and Goodnews Bay. The Patterwn made a voyage of 800 miles and return in response to urgent distress calls from the revenue cutter Tahorna wrecked near Attu Island. This voyage occurred between September 20 and October 3. A portion of the wrecked crew, 29 in number, were rescued, the others having been saved by another vessel. Much rough weather was experienced on this trip. A complete report of the incident was made and is here given.

A REPORT ON THE VOYAGE OF THE COMlT AND GEODETIC SURYEY STEAMER "PATTERSON" fito:M UNALASKA TO AT1'U ISLANll, ALEUTIAN ISLANDS, TO THE RELIEF OF THE WRECKED REn:NlIE CUTTim .. TAHOMA," SEPTEMBER 22 TO OCTOBER 3,

1914. I ha rn the honor to report as follows on the rescue of survhиors of the United States revenue cutter 'l'alwmn, wrecked on a reef near Attu Island, .\leutlnn Islands, on September 20, 1914. There were 87 persons on board the Tahoma, and of this number 58 were found by the steamship Co1иdova and 29 were found by the Patterson. One boat had been four dnys and nights at sea when found, and the others had been three days and nights ut sea nnd three days on the uninhabited fslands of Aguttu and Semlchl. All the boats had traveled 100 to 150 miles in rough wen ther. On September 20 the revenue cutter Tahoma was on her return from Attu Island, and at!) p. m. of that day she struck on a reef 31 miles f1иom the nearest land. At 11 p. m. of the same dny her distress signals were received by the radio station at the Pribilof Islands, GOO miles distant from the wreck, and from there were recehиed by the l'attcrson, which was 700 miles distant from the wreck. The J'atter8on was on her return from Goodnews Bay with the crew of the Coast nnd Geodetic Surrny steamer l'ulcon on board and had reuchecl shelter from a northwest gale a few hours before. On receiving the distress cull the vessel started at once for Unalaska to take coal and discharge her passengers. The gale continued, and she arrived after 16 hours' steaming. She wus coaled on the night of the 21st and started for the wreck at 5 u. m. on the morning of the 22cl, 30 hours after the distress call was received. No other ships had started at that time. The following ships also received the distress signal: The revenue cutter Bear ,.;иns near Nome, 000 miles from the wreck, nnd her captain refused to give assistance on account of lnck of coal anu because he was then relievini.; the steamer Corwin, nground near Xome. 'l'he Japanese steamer '.l'aco111a was supposed tu be 400 miles from the wreck, but coulcl not be reached hy radio. The steamship Senato1и was near Unlmak Pass, 1,000 miles from the wreck, ancl offered assistance, but was delayed by the northwest gale and later declined to go. The steamship Cordovri was at Nome, m:;o miles from the wreck, and offered assistance; she started at once, turned bnclc once, and finally arrived at Klska Island at the same time as the Patterson and proceerled to Agattu Island, near which place she found 4 boats containing 58 persons. The steam whaler Kodiak stnrtecl from Unalaska 18 hours after the l'atterson and arrived at the wreck at almost the same time.

The Patterson Is not n seaworthy vessel. She hi slow nnd underpowered nnd must depend to u grent extent on her s111ls. All the other vessels mentioned nbove are faster; nnd although there was no doubt whnte\иer thnt the situation culled for every effort to be made to sa\иe the wrecked crew, It was expected that other relief would nrrhиe sooner, and that It would then be possible to turn back. The weather prove1l unexpectedly fnvorable, howe,иer, with favorable winds, und the Patterson 111-rh'e!l ut the wreck on September 2G ut noon. '.l'he Tahoma wns found to have bel!n nhunclone!l; she lny partly on one side. with decks awash. The reef extended for about u mile on all sides, and was covered with thick kelp; on the shoalest part near the wreck were breakers, and the least depth ls less than 2 fathoms; there are no rocks above water. There was a 16-foot swell at thnt time. I boariled the wreck, uml found everything apparently a total loss; the ship was entirely tilled with water to the upper deck. The weather \1иus unusually clear, and Buldlr Island eoul1l be seen 31 miles awny; In oNllnnry weather no lnnd can be seen. A good lookout had been kept from the Patterson the prevlom:; night fol" Coston lights, and electric lights hnd been shown from thи~ rigging, und the same was done the following night; during the llny u loolrnut was kept from the foretop, bridge, and deck. The steamship Cordova had reported by radio that 4 boats with 58 persons hud been found before !lurk on September 26, near Aguttu Island, 80 miles northwest of the wreck; this arrangement had been mn!le, that she should search there nnd the Patterson nearer the wreck; she therefore did not visit the wreck nt nil. From the wrecl;: the Patterson proceeded northwestward senrching for hon ts; but neither she nor the Cordova had any success on the 27th. On the night of the 27th the Cordova started on her return to Unalnslrn, us she had lnsuftlclent fuel to remnln longer. On the 28th the Patter.~on proceeded to the western point of Agnttu Islnn!l, and found there the remaining 3 bouts with 29 persons, thus accounting for nil. The sur\'lvors were In good comlftlon, but had no provisions, and were reduced to one meal a dny; they were living on sea gulls, puffins, mussels, and snails. They had no clothing except what they wore. The Patterson then started nt once for Cnnluskn, and, hnvlng fnvoI"able winds, reached there October 3, hefore the other ships. The I"eturn pussnge wus made southwnrd of the Aleutian lslnntls. The voyage out nml returning amounted to 1,600 miles. The engines were not forced nt nny time, us It wns not thought safe to attempt this; und lt wus only on account of fttvornble weather that the vessel wns uhle to mulfo the trip ns she dill. Gales nml rough seas were experienced on the return, but the wind wns generally favoruble. Coples of distress culls from the Tahoma. are uttncheil. It Is not considered necessnry to lnclose copies of the voluminous radio correspondence with other steamships and with the commnmlunt of the Bering Seu revenue cutter fleet nt Unnlnska.

On June 2, 1915, the steamer Patterson sailed from Port Townsend for Alaska, arriving in the Shumugin Islands on the 21st, where work was immediately begun. En route to the Shuma..,.m Islands a stop of three days was made in Kupreanof Strait, Kodiak Island, in order to locate a rock in \Vhale Passage reported by the steamer Santa Ana. The rock was located in practically the same position as had been reported; a depth of 15l feet at mean lower low water was found. The Patterson arrived at the working grounds, Shumugin Islands, on the afternoon of June 21. A camp was established at Mist Harbor, east coast of Nagai Island. Four officers and Hi men, equipped with two launches, one motor whaleboat, and with necessary tenders, were ~eft ~n camps w~ile the ':essel engaged in signal building 5:m t~e outlymg islands. The rerr_iamdcr of the month was occupied m signal building and reconno1ssance, no other survey work was accomplished, consequently no progress sketch or statistics accompany this report. On J unc 30 the vessel was at Sand Point, Popof Island.

SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Buse lines: 1 secon1lary, 1 mile In lenlcth. Triangulation: 90 squure miles of urea coverell, 3 signal poles located by triungulution, 11 observing signals und scaffolds erected, height of scaffolds 30 feet, lG geographic positions determined. Leveling: 2 mlles of levels run (along base line). A:r.lmuth : 1 station occupied for azimuth observations on 1 night. Topography: 10 miles of general coast line surveyell (shore line only), 1 topographic sheet finished, scale 1: 20,000. Ilydrography: 100 squure miles of nreu sounded, 817.8 miles run while sounding (Includes reconnoissunce), 1,707 angles measured, 12,945 soundings made, 4 tide stations established, 5 current stations occupied, 2 hydrographic sheets finlshecl, scales 1 : 100,000 anti 1: 20,000.

'Vork by the party on the steamer Yulcon at the entrance to the Kuskokwim River, Alaska, the primary object of which was the charting of a navigable chann_cl int<! that river, was begun about the middle of June, 1914, as mcnt10ned m the last annual report, but the details of the work done during June were not available for that report. On June 16, 1914, the Yukon started from Goodnews Bay on a reconnoissance trip tQ Eek Island. That night she anchored at the northern limit of the 1913 work and иearly in the morning proceeded up what was supposed to be Warehouse Channel until a position off Warehouse Bluff was reached where ~he channel seemed to end with shoal water on every side. Finally, however, the Yulcon drifted through a narrow cut into a fine 4-fathom channel which was followed for several miles. After two or three more similar experiences the vessel reached Apokak Creek where she remained at anchor overnight. The following morning a tide observer was put in camp at Apolrnk and about noon the Yulcon started downstream with a strong ebb tide, expecting to go out bv either the Eek or the West Channel. Dropping down with the cmrent of the Eck Channel, another channel was observed crossing a mud flat to the westward. Turning back

and entering this channel against a strong current the head of the mud flat was rounded and the иwest Channel was entered and followed with deep water for several miles. After passing another narrow shoal place and continuing due south for 15 miles farther the channel was again lost and recovered and deep water was followed to a junction with the 1913 work. That night the Yukon proceeded to Goodnews Bay. On June 21 the Yulcon again left Goodnews Bay bound for Apokak, this time assisting the coal schooner Harold Blelcum which had just arrived off Goodnews Bay. After an uneventful but difficult trip the channels were successfully navigated and both vessels anchored off Apokak where the work of building a small warehouse and storing supplies was begun. By the 29th this work was completed and a large tower signal mth observing tripod had been erected at Apokak. On the following day the Blelcum started for sea but had considerable difficulty in getting out.. Du.r;ing- this time both t~e Yulcon and the Blelcum, were caught m a six days' storm fur out m the иwest Channel. This experience shows that no vessel should try to ride out a strong gale in this vicinity, as the ofHying shoals do not afford protection to vessels anchored there. During July the party was able to work only one and one-half days in developing the channels through the great estuary. This work had to be controlled by distant mountains and only on perfectly clear days was it possible to see signals. During thick and hazy weather the party was engaged in measuring a base line, extendin~ the triangulation, buildingи large signals, and sounding in the vicinity of Eek Island. In Au!!nst there were four dnys on which the distant mountains were visible, and during this time the Eck Channel was well located and defined, and one days' work was accomplished in locating the West Channel. In doina this work it was always planned to work with a favorab1e tide. Current observations were made during the night when the vessel was at anchor. The week of August 10 to 17 was spent in making a series of tide obsern1tions at vVarehouse Creek and Quinhagak. A tide staff was erected at Goodnews Bay and connected by leveling with the old bench marks. On August 25 a reconnoissance trip was made to Bethel under the guidance of a native pilot. Only two shoal bars were crossed; the first crossover aboYe Eek Island where 17 feet was found and the last crossover before reaching Bethel where 13 feet was found. In the main the channels are deep carrying from 4 to 12 fathoms. At Bethel theodolite observations on Polaris for latitude and sextant observations on the sun for longitude were obtained. Tide observations were also made and bench marks established. On the night of September 3 an azimuth was measured at station Apokak by observations on Polaris. On September 12 the steamer Yukon and launch Alpha were laid up at Goodnews Bay and on the 17th the party went on board the steamer Patterson, which conveyed them to Seattle by way of Unalaska. . . The party again proceeded to the field in June, 1915, and at the close of the fiscal year was nearly ready for work.

SUMMARY OF REsur.rn.-neconnolss:mce: Length of scheme 12 miles, 10.5 miles of urea co,иered, 72 lines of intervisihility determined, 24 points selected for scheme. Base lines: 1, se(иondary, 1,200 meters In length. 'l'rlangulation: 10.5 square miles of area co,иere<l, 2!) signal poles erected, 20 stations in main scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 24 stations occupied for vertical measures, 32 geographic positions determined, 20 elevations determined trlgonometrlcnlly.

A party was organized at Seattle in June of the previous fiscal year for the triangulation to connect Prince "William Sound and Turnagain Arm, a tributary of Cook Inlet, Alaska. Leaving Seattle June 26, the party arrived at Ellamar, Alaska, on July 4. From Ellamar transportation was furnished by the Coast and Geodetic Suney steamer Talcn to Portage Day, arriving July 8. On the following day one of the triangulation stations established during the previous season was recovered and one new station was selected. A reconnoissance trip was made over Portage Glacier to Dear Valley and return. The glacier at this time was fairly smooth and crossing was. not difficult. The snow bridges a<'ross the deeper crevasses were genernlly safe and as the snow along the edge of Tunnel Shoulder had not melted it was easy to reach the solid ice of the glacier. The party remained at the Portage Bay camp until July 21 at which time the reconnoissance for all stations east of Portage Glacier was .completed and the stations established. Three of the stations selected during the previous season at the head of Passage Canal were recovered and reoccupied. A new camp was then located on the foot of rock slide about a quarter of a mile from the east end of Portage Glacier. The hills in this locality are of a very rocky formation, and as there is no growth of any kind above the gravel flats it was necessary to pack the firewood up the 800 feet elevation to the camp. From this base were established the two stations Portage and Turnngain on the west side of the glacier, and all the stations to the east of these two were occupied. Camp was moYed to the west si<le of the glacier on August 6. For the scheme up to this point only the higher elerntiom; had been used but after carrying the triangulation across the glacier it was found that the work could be carried on more rapidly by using smaller figures and confining the stations to the low ground of the graYel flats of Turnagain Valley. From the glacier to the two stations Rail and Road on the line of the Alaska Northern Railway all the stations are nt low eleYations and the lines are from one-half to 1~ miles in length. The gravel flats between Portage Glacier and the head of Turnagain Arm are badly cut up by the glacial streams from the south side of the valley and by Portage River and its numerous branches. The main brunch of Portage River is very swift and too deep to ford in most places. Boats were borr░'ved from the Alaskan Engineering Commission party for crossing the river. Owing to the difficulty of transporting cement all stntions from Gravel and Ford to the western end of the work are marked with stakes only. The base camp was moved on August 27 to the north side of Portage River just east of the Alaskan Northern Railway. A boat

was constructed by the party for the work on the south side of Turnagain Arm. A 1,200-meter base was measured on the mnd flats from station Sand to the eastward, and was connected with the work across the glacier and also with the work of 1912. On September 11 the final observations were completed and the computations were sufficiently advanced to show that the connection between the two bases was satisfactory. On the afternoon of the 11th the party moved to Kern Creek and on the following day was transported on a launch chartered by the Alaskan Engineering Commission to the headquarters of the commission at Ship Creek. Here they remained for six days, being housed and subsisted by the commission until the arrival of the steamer Admiral Evans, which took them to Seattle. A sketch of the work east of and across Portage Glacier, together with the angles and distances was given to R J. 'Veir, of the Alaskan Engineering Commission, :for nse in locating the tunnel entrances and for other purposes relating to the railway location.
[.T. W. GnEEN.]

The usual observations were continued without interruption during the year with the ph<;>tographic recording instruments at the magnetic obserrntory at Sitka. Absolute observations, consisting of three sets of declination, two sets of dip and the regular double set of horizontal intensity were obtained on one day of each week. Time observations from noon transits of the snn were obtained when practicable. The seismograph was kept in constant operation throughout the year and 17 earthquakes were recorded.

backs the necessary provisions, water, and blankets and worked back the remaining 5 miles, afterwards returning to Puu Kapukapu and Pahab plantation and thence by automobile and train across the volcano and around to Pahoa in the Puna district, a distance of about 60 miles. No difficulty was encountered in the survey of Puna, the east end of Hawaii. Pahoa was a base centrally situated from which all parts of the coast were easily accessible over fair roads and trails and an abundance of fresh water was found everywhere. As in other parts of the Hawaiian Islands the primary triangulation stations of the old Hawaiian Government were recovered and enough supplemental work was done to adequately control. all parts of the shore. All stations were described and marked. Hills and stacks, useful as offshore hydrographic signals, were located, and in order to aid in their identification from offshore most of these, as well as the primary stations, were photographed. Owing to natural difficulties and the great expense involved, it was not considered advisable to continue the triangulation along the coast toward stat~on Puu Kapukapu beyond the line Laeapuki-Panau, and particularly as the determination of Puu Kapukapu from the above line by plane-table triangulation coincided with its plotted :position from the other side, indicating an accuracy more than sufficient for topographic and hydrogruphic purposes. The topography was executed on a scale of 1: 20,000 and 16 sheets were required to complete the island. An accurate delineation of the shore line was made, mcluding the off-lying rocks and shoal water as indicated by breakers. Heights of cliffs were shown, though there was but little cliff line and the height rarely exceeded 50 feet. Those spots were indicated иwhere landing under favorable conditions is most feasible. There are no protected anchorages for small boats, the nearest approach to one being inside the islet at Keauhou. In connection with the topography, stone cairns were erected or pinnacle rocks utilized, and painted white, for the use of hydrographic parties, and every :few miles exceptionally large ones were marked to aid in offshore work. The latter were whitewashed. A revision of the chart of Hilo Bay was made to show the new Kuhio Bay wharf and changes in buoys. The breakwater remained practically the same as shown by the survey made in 1912. The topography of the shore line from Kalapana to Keauhou, a stretch of 30 miles lying between Punaluu and Kalapana below the volcano, was afterwards executed, and the survey of the island of Hawaii was completed on December 31. Field work on the survey of the island of Molokai was begun on March Hi. The existing triangulation of the island was used for control o:f the topography, and as nearly all prominent objects useful as aids to navigation or for offshore hydrographic signals were included in the system of triangulation, no additional tnangulation work was necessary. The old triangulation stations useful in work along the coast 'vere recovered and re-marked. In one or two instances the redwood posts marking the stations were missing but the stations were recovered by means of reference marks on the rocks. The monuments used in re-marking the stations were of uniform pattern, consisting of truncated pyramids of concrete about 8 inches

A l>ronze station murk was placed in the center of each monument. Glass bottles were used as subsurface marks, except where the monuments were set in rock. The topographic survey of the shore line on a scale of 1: 20,000 was extended from the extreme northeast point of the island, Lamaloa Head. southward around Hulawa Point, thence westward around Laau Point, and northward to within 2! miles of Ilio Point, the extreme northwestern corner of Molokai, a general coast line of 56! miles. This work was included on three topographic sheets. The chart of Kaunakukui Harbor was also revised. The work on the island of Molokai was suspended on Muy 31.

From January 1 to March 1G the steamer Researck was undergoing repairs and outfitting at Manila. On the afternoon of March Hi the vessel left Manila for the working ground in the vicinity of Sorsogon Ray and to the northward, stopping at Port San Miguel, Ticao Island, to inspect the automatic tide gauge established there during the previous season. Upon arrival at the entrance to Sorsogon Bay signals were at once erected and the topography begun. The work here was well controlled by numerous tnangulation stations occupied during the previous season. From these stations nearly all of the hydrographic signals "\\иere cut in. ~y M;ay 15 the topography was completed as fur north us Dumaqmt Pomt. It was then taken up on the west side of the south end of Ticuo Island and continued northward. Two main-scheme triangulation stations, Dulan and Cabrian, the secondary stations necessary for the topography along the Luzon coast from Donsol to Cabarian Point and from the south end of Burias Island to Claveria, were established. Intersection stations were placed from 2 to 4 miles apart on both Luzon Island and Burias Island. Heliotropes were used on the lines Enganso-Donsol and Sagurun-Donsol. иwhen the triangulation was finished the topography was continued and the hydrographic work begun. The hydrography of the entrance to Sorsogon Bay and all of Ports Panlatuan and Putiao as far offshore as the 20-fathom curve was done by the launch party. The rest of the hydrography was done with the ship.

This vessel wns e~ployed at the beginning of the fiscal year in the survey of the region between Masbate and southern Lu~on which includes Ticao Island. The triangulation was extended to a junction with :former work in Burias Island, a base line was measured near Bulan, the shore line of Luzon from Ticlin Strait to Sorsogon Bay and of the eastern side of Tieno Islnnd was surveyed and the hydrography was completed in Black Rock Pass and between Ticao and Luzon. An examination was made for a shoal off the east coast of Panay on which the steamer Rubi, drawing 15 feet of water, was reported to have struck in May 1914. No spot on which a Yessel could touch was found in the position reported but depths of Hi and 17 feet with rocky bottom were found on a shoal approximately 1 mile to the eastward. In Ticao Pass and Black Rock Pass the topography included a small area around the town of Magallanes on the Luzon side, the east coast of Ticao south from a point 1 mile south of Nunun Point, Matabas Island, and the Masbute coast from Tabunan Point around Uson Bay to Gorda Point. The hydrogruphic survey of Ticao Pass, completed August 26, 1914, inc'Iudes the greater part of the area north of a line running east from Biton Bay to longitude 123░ 57', thence N. 33░ E. to longitude 124 ░ 00', and thence en st to Ticklin Strait and south of a line :from San Miguel Lighthouse to Bagatae Lighthouse. A base line 5,820 meters in length was measured at Bulan,и and seven points in the base net were occupied. Three new stations were required to connect the base line with the main scheme. A supplemental scheme of triangulation was executed between Masbate nnd Ticao. The topography and hydrography of .Jnmelo Cove. were revised.

On May 15, having comr.leted repairs and outfitting at Manila, the steamer .ii{ arinduque sailed for the working grounds cast of the Calamianes Islands, arriving on the 16th. иwork was begun on the following day. The first work undertaken was the development of the open urea which extends some 9 miles to the eastward from Deliun Island and includes Magallanes Bank, Alpha Shoal, and two otherи shoals, one of which appears to have been previously unknown and neither of which had been accurately delimited. Signals had been pre,иiously determined by triangulation by another party, so that it was possible to begin soundings at once. All of the open area was developed by the ship, using Tanner-Blish tubes for most of the work. The depths were from 30 to 50 fathoms and the tubes were tested at intervals of an hour or an hour and a half by stopping the ship and getting an up and down machine sounding at the same time that the tubes were lowered to the bottom. No tubes were used which had a correction of more than 2 fathoms. Magallanes Bank was developed by the ship and whaleboat parties using the hand lead. The least depth found after very careful examination was 4-3и fathoms, to which there is little or no tidal reduction. This is near the southern end of the bank. The shoal area is a coral ridge about 2 miles long and a quarter of u mile. wide, lying northeast and southwest but curved conYex to the northwest. It is steep-to at the northeast end and has detached spots with 8 to 12 fathoms at the south end. Alpha shoal was dewloped by the whaleboat and launch parties. It is much smaller in extent than Magallanes Bunk and is farther offshore than is shown. A least depth of 3t fathoms was found. This is also a coral area.и A launch party with camp on shore recovered old stations und built signals for the inshore hyrography. The launch hydrography was then begun at Calis Point and carried northward as rapidly as possible in order to finish up the area exposed to the southwest monsoonи. A uniform svstem of lines was run over this area and then a special examination was made of all shoal spots discovered and of all suspicious and doubtful area. All shoal spots were thoroughly developed with the hand lead and in depths of 5 fathoms or less special care was taken to watch for coral heads in order to get the shoalest soundings on them. The launch work was in progress at the close of the year.

The ship work was completed on May 28, and a reconnoissance was made of the region between Busuanga and the small islands to the northeast. A scheme was laid out for the location of intersection stations; on the :wth two signals were built and a reconnoissnnce made at stntions N anga and Luhutglubut. The scheme as planned is strictly tertiary and includes the determination of 22 new points for the control of topographic and hydrogruphic surveys. During June the tertiary triangulation between the northeast coast of Bnstmn~a and the offiying islands and the hydrography north along the voron coast to and including most of the Coron Islnnds and part of Minangas Bay and two small areas of topography north of Alonon Point and in Minangas Bny, were completed. Magnetic declination was observed at five triangulation stations. The shoals along the east coast of Coron Island were well developed, as most coasting vessels when southbound run well in toward Delian Island. The 1 and 2 fathom soundings on coral heads are so numerous and so widely distributed as to make this area very dangerous. Southbound vessels should keep at least lJ miles eastward of a line drawn :from Metaya Island to the east tangent of Delian Island. Alpha shoal has a least depth of about 3 fathoms. The least depth found on 11 reported shoal spot in Coron anchorage was 3 fathoms. In the latter part of June topographic work was begun near Alonon Point and in Minangas Bay. и

At the end of N oyember the vessel returned to Manila for repairs, which were in progress at the close of the year. On .Tuly 1 the Romblon was at work on the east coast of Lina.paean Island among the numerous islands off the northeast coast 0Б Pala.wan Island. The topography and hydrography on the east side of Linapacan Islnnd and around the islands between Linapacan and Culion Island were first completed, and then work was taken up on the north and west coasts of Linupacan Island nnd carried north from Batns Island sq as to fill in a gap between Pala.wan and the islnnds offshore to the eastward from Palttwan, of which Linapacan and Hoc Islands are the largest. A narrow strip along Palawan and a small area north of Iloc Island were left unfinished. .

Offshore work was done by the ship east of Linapacan Island and north of P~la,van. The null?-erous reefs and shoals and the rocky character of the bottom reqmred a close deYelopment in nearly all of the inshore hydrography. The strong currents encountered interfered with hydrographic work both inshore and offshore. In the offshore work the Tanner-Blish tubes and Cosmos sounding machine wer~ used, the tubes being frequently tested. A special method of drymg the tuues was devised. All depths of 20 fathoms or less were sounded with the hand lead. Only a few shoals dangerous to navigation were found.

After the completion of necessary repairs at Manila the steamer Romblon proceeded on February 23 to the east coast of Palawan to resume general surveys in the region in which the steamer 111 arinduque had been working during the past year. The principal work to ue done was the completion of the hydrography in the area along the Palawan coast immediately southwestward of Dumaran Island. This area is full of shoals which require much time for careful development. Dumaran Island offers but little protection against sea and wind making small-boat work difficult during the northeast monsoon. . The topography has been completed south as far us Flechas Point. No further triangulation was done in this area. After the northeast monsoon subsided the party on the Romblon was shifted to Taytay Bay on l\fay 13 to take advantage of the com. ing good weather in exposed localities. The work in the Yicinity of Taytay Bay consists of ~ g.ap left between the work of ~he. steamer 111arinduque's northern hm1t of Hl13 and the southern lumt of the Romblon's work of 1914. By the close of the fiscal year the subsidiary triangulation :for topographic and hydrographic control had been completed and practically all of the topography in the area mentioned. At the end of Juneи the hy<lrogra phy was in progress. The existing charts were found to require many corrections. Many of the shoals. shown on the chart were probably from reports in which the positions were not accurately determined. The inshore areas require careful development. Most of the soundings were made with the hnnd lead as few depths were over 20 fathoms. . Two tide stations were established, one at Flechas Pomt and the other at Taytay. The automatic tide gauge at Araceli was in continuous operation.

The party on the Fathomer was employed throughout the year in the survey of the large area extending from the coast of Panay across the Cuyo Islands to the Calamian Group, with additional work in the vicinity of Iloilo. In the first namedи region some subordinate triangulation was done for the determination of points for the local surveys, especially in the Quinilubun Group. The topographic survey of the Cuyo Group north of Cuyo Island has now been completed. The islands centrally located in the northern part of the Sulu Sea, important as landmarks, are accurately charted. The topography is well controlled. The chief work of the party, however, was that of sounding out these large water ureas which, though generally deep, are studded with numerous shoals rising abruptly from deep water and often forming dangers to navigation. In the vicinity of Iloilo considerable time and labor were expended in nn attempt to locate the position of a shoal in the southwestern approach to that port which had been reported earlier in the yenr by another yessel. An area of 48 square miles was sounded over without finding any truce of a shoal. A lar~e-scale topographic survey of the city of Iloilo was made for special use in connection with projects for improvements. The survey around Culion Island was completed. The water urea west of Mindoro and Panay is the route of considerable ocean traffic. Vessels of large tonnage, Spanish mail steamers, and Austral~an, Japanese, and tramp steamers of various nationalities puss contmuully. The greater part of the hydrogmphy in this region has now. been co.r:npleted. Panuy ha~ been connected with the Cuyos and Mmdoro with Busuungu. A tr.run~lar ureu of about 500 square miles joining the areas above descnbed remains to be done. This gap is southwestward from the Semirara Islands and at such a distance from them that they ure generally not visible. Peaks in Panuy, Mindoro, and the Calamianes, distant from 30 to 60

miles, are used for control in this work and clear weather is necessary. Numerous shoals hitherto unknown have been found. Falmouth Bunk and the bank passed over by Coutts have been located. These shoals and others in this area are small in extent and rise from depths of 200 to 400 :fathoms. Some few gaps remain in the hydrography in the Cuyos Isiands. The bottom in this region is irregular and many uncharted shoals have been found. An automatic tide gauge was kept in continuous operation during the year. Staff gauges were read at various times at Iloilo River, Santa Ana Bay, Guimaros Island, and in the Quinaluban Group. Currents were observed at night when on the working ground and at all times when the vessel was at anchor. Fifty-five stations, covering all portions of the northern part of the Sulu Sea, were occupied. One set of observations for magnetic declination was made at Paya Island. In sounding in depths from 65 to 450 fathoms the ship was stopped. Stranded wire was used. At less depths than 65 fathoms soundings were made while the ship was running at a speed of 6 to 7 knots, using Tanner-Blish sounding tubes. 'The sounding tubes were frequently tested. By June 30 only about 75 square miles of the area south of the Semirara Group remained to be sounded. The completion of this work will close the only gap in the area extending from Cape Calavite at the northwest end of Mindoro to Nogas Island Light on the south end of Panay Island, a very important and much-used route of ocean-going vessels.

K umerous shoals mu de it necessary to run sounding linesи not more than 100 meters apart for inshore work. In December hydrographic work was begun in Coron Bay, Caliumianes Group. A large number of shoals were developed. OhserYations иwith an automatic gauge were continued at Araceli during the season. [R. n. D1mICKSON, Commanding Steamer Pathfinder.]

At the beginning of the fiscal year the steamer Pathfinder was engaged at work on the southern coast of Mindanao, where a surYey was made of the coast from Parang, across the delta of the Mmdanao RiYer, and southward to Port Lebak. This work included the extension of the triangulation across some Yery heavily wooded country as well as the topogmphy and hydrography along the coast. 'Vith the change to the southwest monsoon and the coming of the summer rains the conditions on that coast became unfavorable for progress and the work was closed there at the end of July. During August and the first half of September the Pathfinder worked on the eastern coast of Mindanao and completed the junction, in the neighborhood of Hinatuan, between the surveys previously executed on that coast, proceeding to the southward from Surigao and to the northward :from Cape San Augustin. The ship then returned to Manila for docking and overhauling, bnt unexpected obstacles developed, and she was therefore outfitted for a special examination of certain parts of the Sulu Sea and in particular of Moyune Shoal and vicinity, the British steamship Benqloe having stranded on that shoal on September 13. The information obtained in this preliminary snney has proved to be Yery valuable and has already led to the establishment of several much needed lights in a region where there have never been any aids to navigation. That work occupied the time from the middle of October to the end.of November and while the ship was in southern waters 11; sur-

vey was made of a shoal on the eastern coast of Negros which had been reported by the master of a coasting- steamer. Again returning to Manila the Pathfinder was engaged for two days in a revision of the survey of the coast south of :Manila Bay entrance and for the balance of the year was undergoing repairs at Olongapo and Manila. Repairs to the Pathfinder having been completed the vessel proceeded on January 24 to Subic Bay and determined the least depth over Moron Rocle This work being completed on January 26, the Pathfinder proceeded to the Sulu Sea, running sounding lines from Sombrero Hock to Balabac Strait, Yia Cnlusa Island, Tnbbataha Cays, and Barcoran Island, and thence to Zambounga. Search was made for a 28-fathom spot east of Balabac Strait and also for the Temerario Rock south of North Tubbatuha. Astronomic obsernttions were made at Korth Tubbataha in connection with the' plane-table traverse along the south side of the reef. The position of Calusa Island was verified by astronomic observations and a plane-table suney was made of the entire island. 'Vhile en route from South Islet to Zamboanga the vessel passed over the reported position of C Antibeg Shoal. A depth of 2,422 fathoms was found ut the position of the shoal as shown on the chart. From February 8 to May 7 the party was engaged in the survey of the southwest coast of Mindanao and in taking deep-sea soundings in the Moro Gulf. Between May 8 and 12 a survey was made of Palmas Island. A number of deep-sea soundings were taken while en route from Sarangani Straits. Between May 13 and 15 a small piece of hydrography at Cape San Augustin was completed. A line of deep-sea soundings was run from Palmas Island to Cape San Augustin. The Pathfinder then proceeded to San Bernardino Straits, arriving on the morning of May 25. On that date assistance was rendered the four-masted schooner AlJ!ine which was wind bound and in a dangerous position in the str:nts. 'l'he Pathfinder was engaged in the survey of Palmas Island from May 7 to 12. Seven deep-sea soundings, ranging from 990 to 3,и100 fathoms, were taken on the way to the island. Strong northeast currents were experienced between Palmas Island and Sarangani Straits. The natives of Palmas Island, who are Dutch subjects, at first made objection to the landing of the party, but upon explanation friendly relations were established and they permitted the survey to be made. Astronomic observations were made near the south point of tho island for latitude and longitude and the station occupied was marked: A plane-table suney on a scale of 1: 10,000 was made of the entire island, a traverse along the coast line locating each topographic and hydrographic signal. A magnetic meridian was drawn through the position of the astronomic station. From the west side of Palmas Island Balut volcano and Saddle Peak near the south point of :Mi;idanao, al~o ~he enti~e. range along the southwest coast of Davao hulf are d1stmctly ns1blc m clear weather. The mountains north of Cape San Augustin could not be seen on account of clouds to the westward. Sounding lines were run from the reef line offshore a distance of one-third to 1 mile to the 100-fathom curve at intervals of 200 meters, the possible anchorages receiving close attention.

cerried completely around the island with the exception of a small area at the north point of the island which could not be approached on account of violent overfalls und tide rips. The sounding launch was nearly lost in attempting to cross this area. The survey was concluded with a line of deep-sea soundings ranging from 110 to 500 fathoms around the island. A line of deep-sea soundings was also run between Palmas Island and Cape San Augustin after the survey of the island was completed. A tide staff was erected on the reef at the southwest point of the island and readings were taken every 20 minutes for 52 consecutive hours. Bench marks were established and connected with the staff. In June the Pathfinder completed a special hydrographic examination of an area of 18 square miles in the vicinity of San Bernardino Island. A survey of the approaches and anchorage off the town of Bobon was completed, a suney of the channel south of Cabauan Island was partly finished, and the suney of the north end иof this channel was begun. General hydrographic work in San Bernardino Strait was in progress at the close of the year.
SPECIAL DUTY.
CAl'E COD SHIP
CA~AL.

[O. H. TrrTMANN.]

In accordance with instructions trom the Department the Superintendent attended the formal opening of the Cape Cod Canal on July 29. This canal connects Buzzards and Cupe Cod Bays so as to avoid the dangerous coasting nuYigation around Cape Cod Peninsula nnrl by the inner N antu~ket Shoals. On and after July 30 the canal was open to traffic durmg the day for vessels and barges drawing not over 15 feet. The Coast Survey, as early as 1860, made a topographic survey of the route at the request of the Legislature of the State of Massachusetts, and a commission of which Superintendent A. D. Bache was a member made a report and estimated the cost of the project at $10,000,000. As the cost of the present canal is given as under $12,000,000, this old estimate is of interest. In anticipation of the opening of the canal the survey of Buzzards Bay with the wire drag had already been commenced. After the opening of the canal an inspection was mad~ by a nautical expert and sailing directi9ns for approaching and passing through the canal were prepared and published as n notice to mariners. In the spring of 1915 wire-drag examination of the northern approaches to the canal were begun.

Square Garden from January 30 to February 6, and an officer of the Survey was placed in char~e. About 50 charts were displayed in the space assigned and in two cabinets provided for the purpose, besides sketches showing progress in the various classes of work. The coast pilot volumes, inside route pilot, tide tables, table of depths in rivers and harbors, and other publications of interest to yachtsmen and motor-boat men were also shown. Of the annual report of the Secretary, the annual report of the Superintendent, and of Special Publication No. 23, describing the work of the Survey, a large number was distributed. и Much interest was shown in the charts, particularly in those of the vicinity of New York City and the Hudson River, and in the publications descriptive of the inside waterways along the coast and in the interior of the country. Publications of the Bureau of Lighthouses, Bureau of Navigation, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, Bureau of Standards, and Steamboat-Inspection Service, of interest to mariners, were included in the exhibit. At the close of the exhibition the Secretary of the National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers in a letter addressed to the Secretary of Commerce expressed his appreciation of the display made by the Survey.
TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEY OF A PORTION OF THE GROUNDS OF THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDAl!D~ DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,

[GEORGE D. Cowm.] SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-About H acres of urea covered, 700 elevations determined.

At the request of the Director of the National Bureau of Standards a topographic survey was made in January of a section of the grounds adjoining the buildings occupied by the Bureau and supplementing surveys previously made. Beginning at the intersection of the tangent to the east face of the east building with the north boundary line, a rectangle was laid out giving a control for the whole area. A line of levels was run :from a bench mark on the north platform of the east building through the area to be covered touching on another bench mark and closmg on the starting poinБ. The temporary bench marks controlled the elevations of the entire plot directly. The field work and office work occupied four days. и
PHYSICAL lIYDROGRAPHY, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, MARYLAND, AND VIRGINIA.

The physical hvdrographic work in the Potomac River, in cooperation with the United States Public Health Service, was continued throughout the year, and consisted in observations of currents, densities, temperatures, and tides. The instruments and methods used were the same as in the preceding year.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

127

From July 1 to October 23 eleven series of current observations, from half a day to more than 4 days each, were made on 33 days. The number of miles traversed by the floats was 401, number of current path positions determined 1,004. On account of ice and stormy weather no current obsenations were made in November and December. The places from which current observations were made at various times during the year were Chain Bridge, south end of Georgetown Channel (Black buoy No. 1), Indian Head, Md., Possum Point, Va., Maryland Point Lighthouse, Upper Cedar Point Lighthouse, Popes Creek Wharf, Md., Black buoy No. 13 (Upper Machodoc Creek) to Colonial Beach. The reduction of the current observations consists in plotting on a Coast and Geodetic Survey chart the actual v.ath taken by the float during each series of observations and compiling for each series a table giving a synopsis of the observations with reference to the direction of the tidal current, time run, and distance traveled, together with wind and weather conditions. In addition to the current work, observations bearing on the physical condition of the river were taken at various tiprns and places. They consisted of specific-gravity determinations, water and air temperatures, color, turbidity, ice, wind, and weather conditions. The 45 localities at which observations of this character were taken are distributed along the river from Chain Bridge, the head of tidal influence, to Point Lookout, where the Potomac empties into Chesapeake Bay. These observations were taken at various times between August 9, 1913 and December 31, 1914. Turbidity observations, which consisted principally in noting the color of the water, were made at 45 localities on 292 days, and 2,119 observations were taken. Temperatures of water and air were taken on 274 days, with 2,577 water and 2,118 air determinations. The specific-gravity determinations were made with a field hydrometer, the observations being taken at 2 feet below the surface, middepth, and 2 feet from the bottom, and consisted of hydrometerreadings, together with temperature of water at each depth, and the temperature of the air, etc., at each station. Specific gravity observations were made on 75 days, and 1,887 observations were made. Field work was closed June 5, 1915. By June 30, 85 of the 107 series of observations obtained since July 1913 had been plotted and the corresponding tables had been compiled. By the same date all of the physical observations of the -condition of the river made had been tabulated up to May 6, Hl15. These observations were taken at var.ious times between August 6, 1913, and June 5, 1915. The automatic tide gau~ at Alexandria, Va., was kept running until May 26, 1915, when. the observations were discontinued. A continuous record from this gauge was obtained, beginning July 1, 1913. : The stage of the Potomac at Chain Bridge and of the Anacostia at Bennings Road was frequently determined by tide-staff readings until the end of the season. . Additional observations were made to determine the changes in direction of the current with reference to the stage of the tide. These observations were made on 118 days and the number of observations waS' 2,180.

иCross sections of the Potomac from Chain Bridge to the mouth of the river were determined for each mile of the river. The sections were plotted on charts of the river and the elements of the section, i. e., width, area, and mean depth, were deduced from the и data on the charts. One hunderd and nineteen sections in a distance of 118 miles were thus determined. The tide-water area of the river from Chain Bridge to its mouth, between the high-water shores on each side of the river, was determined. This area, including arms and tributaries, was found to be a trifle over 491 square miles. Copies of field records and compiled data were furnished to the Public Health Service. A series of moving pictures illustrating the work of this party was taken for use in the exhibit of the Department of Commerce at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition.
SURVEY OF SHORE LINE OF PARRAMORE ISLAND, VA.

[W. E.

PARK ER.]

At the request of the commissioner of fisheries of the State of Virginia a survey was made for the purpose of determining as exactly as possible the position of low-water mark in two coves on the west side of the Parramore Island, Va. The localities for which surveys were desired are lrnown locally as Little Beach Cove and Stingray Point Cove, and lie on the western side of the island, the former about midway of the shore and the latter at the southern limit. The county surveyors for Accomac and Northampton Counties, respectively, were detailed to aid in the work and the State oyster police boat was placed at the disposal of the officer in charge of the survey. The cost of the work, with the exception of the travel and .subsistence of this officer, was borne by the State of Virginia. The field work consisted in three operations, namely, the determination of the plane of mean low water at each cove, the establishment of a control for the survey of each, and the survey of the coves. The best obtainable information for determining the planes of mean low water in these coves are from observations made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey at 'Vachapreague life-saving station, Cedar Island, between July 3 and 13, 1911, and at Hog Island lighthouse dock between June 5 and 25 of the same year. The bench marks established at those places are based on 18 high waters and 19 low waters at the former and 19 high waters and 21 low waters at the latter. Tide staffs were set at Wachapreague Life-Saving Service dock and Hog Island lighthouse dock and connected by spirit leveling with the bench marks at each. Similar staffs were set in Stingray Point and in Little Beach .Cove. Simultaneous observations of high and low waters were made of the four staffs during daylight of October 2 and 3, giving the staff readings of two high and four low waters. Light to moderate easterly winds prevailed during the times of these observations. Bench marks were established on the shores of both coves and were connected with the staff's by spirit levels.

The nearest stations or objects to the places for which surveys were desired which had been determined by trian~ulation were two objects on Wachapreague Island, northward or Parramore Island, a station about midway of that island and an object on Revel Island, near the southern encl of P~irramore Island. The last object had been determined by lines of sight which intersect at an angle иof about 10░, and .there was no check. As surveys were desired on n scale of not less than 1 : 5,000 more points were necessary unless base lines were measured. Accordingly, a plane-table triangulation was executed on the projection (1: 10,000) which had been prepared at the office, and the doubtful position was verified and enough other objects were cut in to give sufficient control for the surveys of both coves. The coves were surveyed by plane table on separate sheets and on a scale of 1 : 5,000. The low-water line was determined topographically, allowance being made for the height of the tide above mean low water at the time each point was located. The mean high-water line, or where that was indefinite or at a considerable distance from the plane table, the outer marsh line, was surveyed in the usual way. The work was begun September 30 and completed October 16.

The scope and character of the work of the Survey were shown by an exhibit forming part of the contribution of the Department of Commerce to the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. Navigational charts, coast pilots; and tide tables, which are 'the chief nautical publications of this Bureau, were given a prominent place. The geodetic, astronomical, and magnetic work cf the Bureau was well represented by special publications and bulletins covering those subjects. Surveying methods were illustrated by pictures and lantern slides, the latter shQwn from a/rojecting apparatus which rendered them clearly visible in a lighte room, and by a complete set of instruments and surveying appll~nces. _The instruments _were mounted .as they are when m use, the idea bemg to show as faithfully as possible the special methods employed in the field by the surveyors of this Bureau. Some of the interesting objects exhibited were a tide indicator, connected electricallJ" with a sendipg al paratus and float on the water front so as to show the rise and fal of the tides at the Golden Gate, an exact model of a wire drag used in searching for submerged rocks in navigable waters, and a complete set of photographs of the Bureau's new tide-predicting machine, together with photographs of the tide-predicting machines of other nations. A.n officer of the Survey was detailed to explain the exhibits. A special publication descriptive of the work of the Survey and a special chart of the Golden Gate and San Francisco were dis~ributecl without charge at the exhibition.

SUMMARY OF REsur.Ts.-Bas,~ lines: 17 base lines mea>;ure<l, avernf:!;e length 344 meters. Triangulation: Distance along boundary 37 miles, 182 signals erected, 231 stations occupied for horizontal measures. Azimuth: 2 stations occupied for observ 1tions of azimuth. Leveling: G miles of levl'ls run. Topography: 234 square miles of area covered (Including waterи area), 929 miles of shore line surveyed, 767 Islands located and mapped. Heference marlcs: 243 reference monuments set, distance along boundary 116.5 miles.

The party engaged in the survey of the international boundary on Rainy Lake and Rainy River was in the field at the beginning of the fiscal year. Progress made to June 30 is detailed in the last annual report. The work of the season included the topographic survey of the shores and islands of Rainy Lake from Brule Narrows eastward to Kettle Falls and through International Fulls westward to Baudette, as well as the tower construction and observation of angles on the scheme of triangulation laid out in the previous year to the head of Luke Namacan, and the extension of the small scheme of triangulation down Rainy River from Birchdale to Baudette; and also the location and setting of the necessary boundary reference marks. To furnish control :for the topographic work a sepn.rate partv was engaged on triangulation of Rainy River, and this party after\vards was engaged in setting reference marks on this river. Beginning at Birchdale, Minn., a small triangulation was carried down the river to Baudette, Minn., a distance of 28 miles. Azimuth was observed at stations Creamery and Oak, and 160 reference monuments were set on the banks of Rainy River between Baudette and International Falls. Twelve bases were measured in the triangulation. The small triangulation was controlled by the main scheme to which it was connected in five places. One party was engaged in completing the topography, subsidiary triangulation, setting and numbering of boundary m!muments on Rainy Lake from Brule Narrows to a point on Lake Namacan just west of Kettle Falls. A detailed map on a SGale of 1: 5,000 was made of Kettle Falls and Kettle River and the topography was extended to include the whole of Swell and Seine Bays. The topographic work was on a scale of 1: 20,000 and included all details within 1 mile from the shores of the lake or to the second 10-foot contour where it came within this distance. The elevations were taken from the water surface of the lake, the elevation of which was read each day on a water gauge, the zero of which was determined from bench marks established in 1912-13. The elevation of the lake varied from 1,105.3 to 1,108.1 feet above mean sea level. , _Another party was. engaged in topographic surveys o~ Rainy River. On July 1 tlus party was at work on the Canadian side opposit,e the mouth of the Big Fork River. On July 27 camp was made oil Durand's farm on the American side, and on August 19 camp was established at a point three-fourths mile below Maniton post office. From this camp the mapping of the Indian Reservation on the 'Canadian side was done. "\Vork was completed to the head of Long Sault Rapids by September 11 and the party

moved to a point on the Canadian side about l!t miles below Birchdale. The work was extended from this camp down the river to Frontier post office, where a junction was made with the work by another party. The mapping was aiterwards extended from a point near Ban<lette "иhere the Canadian parties had closed work at the end of the preceding season, to a junction with the surve.Ys by the American party. A separate party took up the topography of Rainy Hiver at Pinewood, extended it up the river to Frontier post office, and then down the ri,иer to connect with work by the Canadian party. Another party completed the mapping on the Canadian side oi the river in the vicinity of Baudette. In ,July Mr. Barnard visited the topograplnc party in camp near the mouth of l~at Hirnr and made a trip up the river to determine how far the topogrnphic work should extend. A trip was made up Kettle RiYer and the limits of the large-scale (1: 5,000) map were determined upon. A contract was made for ii number of concrete blocks to be set in the earth for reference marks. These concrete blocks иwere set in a mass of concrete lG by 1() inches by 4 feet, the concrete being tamped in around the side of the block so as to render the whole one solid muss. 'Where reference murks were in rock the marking was by holes drilled in the rock. As most of the reference-mark sites were triangulation stations already marked by bronze tablets the reference mark was usually set less thnn 1 foot distant from this mark in line with an adjacent triangulation stution, and the distance to the triangulntion tablet accurately measured. In the latter pnrt of July I. R. Poundc.r, the representatiYc of the Canadian commissioner, who had been with the topographic party on Rainy Luke, joined the triangulation party on Hainy River and aided in the execution of the s1mtll scheme of triangulation between Birchdale and Bundette. At Rainer )fr. Pounder made the observations to locate additional reference marks that were found necessary: One of these \YllS on the Canadian abutment of the Canadian X orthern Railway bridge oYer the outlet of Rainy Lake and the other on a small islun<l on the Canadian side u short distance below the dam. On July 2G an examination was mnde of the field sheets of the Canadian party at work at Big Fork on Rainy River. With the aid of these sheets a curved midstream line was determined and by drawing straight lines to conform closely to this cur\'e the points of change of direction on the boundary were determined and the sites where reference marks should be placed for these points of change of direction. In the latter part of July an inspection was mnde of the work of the triangulation party then at Pinewood, Canada. In Angust sites were selected for reference points in the vicinity of Kettle Falls, the plane-table sheets of the Canadian party were inspected, and a visit was made to a Canadian triangulation party then working jn a narrow stream to the westward of White Sand Lake through which the boundary run. Descriptions and positions of triangulation stations in Black Bay and a copy of the sun'ey of that Bny made in 1913 were furnished to the engineer of the International Joint Commission who was engaged jn making a survey of the flooded areas on Rainy Lake.

132

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

In the earl~и part of August an additional plane-table party begun work on Rainy Rh-er in order to complete the survey of the river to Baudette~ the point where the Canadian party had closed work at the end of the previous season. The triangulation on Rainy River was completed early in September. On September 17 the work of the Canadian party at Boucherville was inspected and a tracing \\'US made from their field sheets to aid in the locution of reference marks in that vicinity. Sites were selected for all reference marks between Bundette and International Falls. and ihe numbers :for these marks were decided upon so that the numbering might be done immediately after the marks were set. Having determined the numbers of the reference marks as far as International Falls consecuti\иe numbering was continued aboye the falls and through Rainy Lake. Toward the close of the season the distance across the boundary narrows between reference' marks 273 and 274 \YUS accurately measured with a steel wire, the temperat11re of the wire being taken and the difference of elevation between the points determined. The length of the wire wus afterwards determined by stretching it under similar conditions and like tension and transferring the position o:f the marks on the wire to a railroad track. The distances between the marks on the track were then measnreu with a 30-meter steel tape under tension and the temperature taken. The distances between rcfel'cnce marиks on the abutments of the bridge over the outlet of Rainy Lake and between reference mark'.:l just above the dnm at International Falls were measured. In October a trip was innde dmYn Rainy River from Fort Francis to Baudette on the steamer Agwinda in order to reinspect the completed topographic work, to note the sites of the reference marks and to mark on a map the rnwigable channel of the river. All work on Rainy Lake was completed by October 13 and another party "иas sent to Baudette to expedite the completion of the survey of Rainy Rhиer by mapping the Canadian side of the river in that vicinity. Field work was closed for the season October 26. Theи work at Baudette was practically completed by October 21, and the main party was then disbanded. A detached tiarty was occupied in placing reference marks on Rainy River until November 10.

Starting from the three points, Fourth, Fang, and Fent, of the preYious season, all of which stations lie to the eastward of the east end of Basswood Lake, u main scheme of triangulation (larger than that of the previous season) was deYeloped to the westward, covering Basswood Lake, Basswood RiYer, and the greater part of Crooked Luke, two more figures being required to curry the work beyond Curtain Fulls and into Iron Luke. Twenty-four stations were located for this,. most of them being from 1 to 2 miles buck from the lake shore and generally on the first high ridge or hill back from the lake. These high points are difficult of access and it was necessary in many instances to cut lines of sight through heaYy timber. Maldng the reconnoissance, occupying and marking the stations of the main scheme, and putting in the smaller triangulation from the falls at the east end of Crooked Lake to the 'vidc part of the lake, occupied the time of the entire party from the beginning of the season until September 1, at which date the party was in camp near the east end of Crooked Lake. On September 7 the plane-table work began at a point in the eastern part of Crooked Lake where it had terminated at the close of the previous season. By October 21 the topography of Crooked Lake, including that of Curtain Falls and part of the river below leading into Iron Lake, was completed. и The smaller triangulation was contmued from the falls between Basswood River and Crooked Lake and was extended through the entire length of the lake to Curtain Falls, the lust stations, Lure and Knab, bein~ situated, one on the United States side and one on the Canadian side of the falls. Station Lure was marked by a brass plate on a solid rock ledge 8 feet from the south end of the falls. A number of the stations of the smaller triangulation between the east end of Basswood Lake and the west end of Crooked Lake were tied to the larger scheme, and a connection wns made giving u single determination of the short base measured nt the Hoist during the preceding season. Vertical angles were measured at enough stations to determine the eleYations of nearly all of the triangulation stations. All of the stations were marked either with a small brass plnte set in the rock or by u drill hole with a triangle cut around it, 72 stations being marked by brass plates and 108 by drill holes. Observations for azimuth were made at two stations, Igo and Exit, on two nights each, and both of these stations were connected with the main or larger scheme.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The main scheme of triangulation established by the boundary parties in 1909-10 was used, and by establishing 5 new stations the positions of the 19 stations were determined. The monument numbering and inspection were carried on simultaneously with the triangulation from Monument 2i3 to Monument 295, and without any additional expense. On the completion of the triangulation the work of monument numbering and inspection alorie was continued. Every effort was made to cover as much of the boundary as possible each day. The number of monuments visited and numbered per day depended on the distance between the monuments and the character of the country. An average of about 200 monuments per month was maintained until the swamp section was reached. The numbering of the monuments was accomplished by drilling holes three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter and one-sixteenth inch deep, close together, so as to outline the number desired. To expedite the numbering changeable plates perforated so as to outline the numbers, fitting into a frame adjustable to the section of the monument best suited to the numbers, were used as templates through which tho holes were bored with a light drill. In October five animals were lost by fire, after which time hired teams were used. The completion of the field work was delayed several weeks by flooded swamps, as the depth of the water in the muskegs made them impassable until ice formed in the month of December. Measurements between Monument No. 852 and triangulation station Erca, and between Monuments Nos. 911 and 912 were made with an invar tape, using base-line methods. Field work was closed for the season on December 14.

vVork on the survey of the northeastern boundary between the United States and Canada in the valley of Hall's Stream. was resumed at West Stewartstown, N. H., on July 27. The work planned for the season was the resurvey, including triangulation and t-0pography, and the re-marking of the international boundary line beginning at the eastern extremitv of the section from the Connecticut. River to the St. La\\Tcnce fUver and extending northward along Hall's Stream to its junction with the section following the crest of the highlands that separate the drainage of the St. Lawrence River from that of the St. John River. The topographic survey had for its southern limit the parallel of 45░ as monumented by the boundary-survey parties operating in this section under the treaty of 1842 and was extended up the valley of Hall's Stream for 15 miles, the completed work being represented on

3i standard topographic sheets on a scale of 1: 5,000. For reference
of elevations to sea level the height of a point on the railway track in front of Beecher Falls railroad station, based on a system of railroad levels, and stated to be 1,093 feet above sea level, was used. From this point a line of levels was extended northward connecting boundary Monuments 517, 518, 519, and 519a with all the triangulation points on the Canadian side and with the base s~ations on the American side of Hall's Stream. At all triangulation stations occupied vertical angles were observed on all visible triangulation signals and on the Hugs in trees erected for the use of the topographical party. The levels were run with a wye level and the main line was checked by running forward and back. A line of levels had been previously run through this valley by a Canadian party in 1914, and approximate connections were made with its elevations. For the tri:mgnlntion a base was measured near the mouth of the valley, and at one of the stations in a figure, of which the base forms a sidet !.1zimuth was observed on Polaris. The connection with Hertford Mount triangulation station, the nearest point in the Canadian Geodetic Survey, was made through a quadrilateral which included three points of the valley tringulation, and the angles were observed at all four stations. tn addition to the stations selected for the regular triangulation scheme a number of high trees in commanding J?OSitions along the high hills surrounding the valley were marked with flags and then located by horizontal and vertical angle observations for the use of the topographic party. Many of the lines in the trim1gulation hfld to be cut through dense timber. Above Pncquette\иille, where the valleyis narrow, the scheme was restricted to small-sided figures and the rate of progress was reduced. Fog nls0 interfered with obsenиations in this portion of the work. The character of the bottom of the valley, in the section below Malvina, through which Hall's Stream flows, is generally alluvial, with only occasional instances of rocky banks, and in consequence changes have occurred in the situation of the stream since the first survey under the 'Vebster-Ashburton treaty, although these are not great, und seem to be the result of gradually operating natural forces. ln one case the course of the stream has been deflected into the Americ::n shore :for a maximnm distance of 400 :feet in the vicinity of a railroad bridge. The alterations in the stream have displaced all the monuments set by the Smith-Estcourt commission between the mouth of King Creek and Monument 518, and the only monument found stnnding in thi.s section was one near the American end of the bridge which connects the road across ,Job 'Vheeler's farm with the main road in Canada. This monument was originally located near the mouth of West Brnnch and having been washed out of its previous position was set up in its present position by a former owner of this farm. Seventeen monuments were set by the party along the stream, being disposed as e9ual.ly along its len.gth as conditions promising permanence nnd smtub1hty for murkmg the location of . the stream would permit. The monuments are either bronze boundary marks, cemented in bowlders or ledges of rock, or similar marks set in cement posts that were securely fixed in the ground or substantial beds of concrete. Six of the old monuments were reset in bases of concrete.

DETAILS OF OFFICE OPERATIONS.

The assistant in charge of the Coast and Geodetic Survey office has direct supervision over the work of the office. The miscellaneous section and the tidal research section are under his immediate direction. Under an a:ppropriation made by the last Congress two new buildings were erected for the accommodation of the chart printing office which have greatly improved the working facilities and the sanitary conditions in that branch of the office, but much work remains to be done in the older portions of the plate-printing offices. An increase in the force of laborers is necessary to keep the workrooms and office rooms in sanitary condition. It is recommended that the old wooden buildings in the grounds be removed and that the vaults under the ground in front of the Richards Building be made waterproof, thus providing for storage in a systematic, safe, and economical manner. The installation of fire plugs and fire hose in the Butler Building and printing office is necessary to protect the valuable original records and engraved plates stored in those buildings against destruction by fire. и The wooden shelving in the library and archives should be replaced by steel shelving. Furniture and drafting tables in use in the drawing section and in the computing and tidal divisions should be replaced by modern furniture and appliances. The connection of the Survey buildings with the central power and heating plant is urged as a matter of convenience and economy. The installation of direct-driven motors and modern machinery in the instrument shop is a much needed improvement and is earnestly recommended. An offset press for chart printing is an urgent necessity. Without such a press it would be impossible to meet promptly an emergency demand for charts, even by working night and day. A readjustment of the salaries of office employees and increases in the numbers and salaries of certain grades are needed in order that necessary work may be kept up to date and in order that the Survey may be a~le to retain the services of efficient employees who now often obtam transfers to other branches of the Government service where rates of compensation are higher and promotion more rapid. A plan has been adopted of publishing all large-scale charts of the Atlantic coast, up to the scale of 1 : 80,000, with soundings in feet instead of fathoms. This has met with general approval. A plan has been approved for greatly simplifying the information in regard to tides and currents published in the tide tables so as to make them most useful for practical purposes. A new suboffice has been established at Galveston, Tex.; and at Boston, Mass., and New Orleans, La., offices supplied with. charts and publications of the Survey have been established under the supervision of the Bureau of Forei~ and Domestic Commerce. Arrangements have been made by which a stock of charts for sale to the public will be kept at the subofilces, and also on vessels of the Lighthouse Service.

The most important work completed or in progress in the computing division during the year is as follows: . Computation and adjustment of the following pieces of triangulation: Alon~ the thirty-ninth parallel between the western boundary of Missoun and the eastern boundary of West Virginia, including a spur from the main arc extending into Kentucky; the triangulation which controls the surveys of the Maryland Shellfish Commission; along the coast of Oregon and on the Columbia River; on the western coast of the Olympic Peninsula between the Strait of Juan de Fu ca and Grays Harbor; along the coast of Maine; across the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska, joining Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound; the adjustment of the triangulation from Prince William Sound to the head of Cook Inlet to eliminate the error of closure of the loop, the Kenai Peninsula triangulation being the connecting link; along the St. Croix River in eastern Maine; along the Rainy River in northern Minnesota; the arc between Memphis, Tenn., and Huntsville, Ala. The computation and adjustment of the following lines of precise leveling: Fr~m Crookston, Minn., to Butte, Mont., along the Great Northern Railway; from Butte, Mont., to Pasco, 'Vash., by way of Spokane, including ti spur line from Sand Point, Idaho, to the Canadian boundary. The computation and adjustment of latitude, the observations for which were made during the summer of 1914. These stations were established along the Texas-California arc of primary triangulation and along the oblique boundary between Nevada and California. иThe computation and adjustment of the longitude, the observations for which were made during the summer of 1914, at the stations Far Rockaway, Long Island, Cambridge, Mass., and Naval Observatory, Washington, D. C. This work was done in connection with the determination of the difference in longitude between Far Rockaway, Long Island, and Borkum, Germany, in cooperation with the Royal Prussian Geodetic Institute. The computation and adjustment of the longitude, the observations for which were made at stations along the Memphis-Huntsville arc of primary triangulation and at one of the stations of the triangulation made to. connect ~ detach~d scheme near L?uisville, Ky., with the transco!1tmental triang';'lat10n; the ~omputat10n and adjustment of observat10ns made for azimuth at stat10ns on the Memphis-Huntsville arc of primary triangulation. The computation and adjustment of observations made for the determination of the intensity of gravity at a number of stations; the computation of the ~ffect o.f topogr~phy' and isostatic compensation at a number of gravity stat10ns; an mvestigation made in connection with a test of the formula which gives the variation in the intensity of gravity with the elevation of the station above sea 'level. Three publications giving results of triangulation and leveling have been received from the printer during the fiscal year, namely, Special Publication No. 19, entitled "Primary triangulation on the one hundred and fourth meridian, and on the thirty-ninth parallel in Colorado, Utah, and Nevada"; Special Publication No. 22, entitled

DIVISION OF TERRES'l'nIAL l\IAGNETISl\I.

The revision of the field observations on land and at sea was kept up to date. Information in regard to the variation of the compass was supplied for 155 charts. Special Publication No. 20, which contains the results of magnetic observations made in 1913, which was sent to the printer last year, was <lelirnred July 29; 1914. The Results of Observations mac.le at the Tucson Magnetic Observatory in 1911 and l!H2, sent to the printer in May, lVH, were delivered August 1, 1014. Special Publication No. 25, containing the results of magnetic observations made in 1914, was completed and sent to the printer February 17, 1915, and was delivered early in May, 1915. The manuscript for Special Publication No. 33, to take the place of Special Publication No. 9, has been l?repared and is nearly ready for publication. For the 1915 iHogomc chart, which will accompany the nborn and also be published separately, a new base map has been prepared, which contains about 1,200 names of places. The 1915 magnetic tables are in course of preparation and are well ndvanced. All the magnetic elements haYc been tabulated but only the declinations have been reduced to the epoch, 1915.0. The observatory results for 1913-14 for Cheltenham, Tucson, Porto Rico, Sitka, and Honolulu are all in preparation. The 1913 results for all are finished, and for Cheltenham and Tucson the 1914 results are about half done and for Honolulu about one-fourth done. As usual, lists of the " magnetic character of days " at all of the magnetic observatories of the Coast and Geodetic Survey were/.repared and furnished to Dr. van Everdingen, De Bilt, Hollan , in accordance with a resolution of the International Commission for Terrestrial Magnetism, and quarterly reports of the principal magnetic storms recorded at the Cheltenham OhserTatory were supplied to the editor of the Journal of Terrestrial Magnetism for publication. The tabulation of earthquakes recorded at. the firn magnetic observatories was made and two copies were furnished to Prof. Harry

Woodworth, of the Harvard seismological station, at Cambridge, Mass. Various miscellaneous computations and tabulations were made at various times; e. g., computation of moment of inertia for magnet-и ometers, tabulation of results of magnetic observations in the vicinity. o:f the United Stutes and Canada boundary, etc. The tabulation o:f data concerning observations at the five observatories in cooperation with the Australian antarctic expedition of 1912-13 was completed. &vision иwas also made of the obserrntions made at Cheltenham to standardize various instruments, including one :for the United States Lake Survey and one for the Naval Observatory. The number of requests :for information received during the year was larger than for any previous fiscal years except 1912 and i914.
TIDAL DIVISION.

The work of the tidal division :for the year includes the preparation of the annual Tide Tables, with reprints :for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts; harmonic analyses were completed for 3 stations o:f 1 year each, :for 8 stations of 29 days each, and snmmations were made tor an analysis :for 2 other stations o:f 1 year en ch; nonharmonic reductions were made for 161 stations, with a combined length of 34 years, 5 m<?nths, and 19 days; mean sea level was computed :for 46 stations. with a combined length o:f 15 years, 5 months, and 21 days; tabulations of high and low waters, and hourly heights of the sea, were made :for 257 stations, with a combined length o:f 50 years, 9 months, and 22 days; monthly means and extremes :for 12 stations, with a combined length of 88 years and 8 months; the diurnal ineqnality for 18 stations, "'.ith a combined length of 7 years, 5 months, and 28 days: the reduction of 374 volumes of soundings, invohing the computation of the plane of reference :for 159 stations, and the entering of many thousand tide reducers: registering and indexing tidal records received during the year; indexing and filing all tabulations and reductions made during the year. The total number of calls upon the tidal division :for work or information during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1915, was 1,138.In accordance wit~ an agreement made in former years, tidal predictions :for ffre stat~ons were made and sent to the Imperial Hydrographic Office at 'Vilhelmshaven, Germany. At the request of the government of wиestcrn Australia, tidal predictions for Port Hedlal)d were made and sent for the years 1914, 1915, and mm; and for Fremantle for the year 1915. The manuscript of the General Tide Tables :for 1916 was complPted, and the printed tables were received from the Printing Office in April, Hll:>, while the Atlantic and Pacific coast reprints were received in May, 1915. They are similar to the tide tables of preceding years, with corrected values where additional informat10n has been received. For the first time predicted tides were made for Seattle, ''rash., :for the year 1915, and sent to Capt. J. F. Pratt, inspector, Seattle,

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.
CHART CONSTRUCTION DIVISION.

141

The aim o:f this division is to afford, by means of charts and Notices to Mariners, the latest information with respect to the navigable waters of our coasts with as little delay as possible, and to show this information on the charts in a manner by which it can be most dearly read and easily comprehended. In carrying out this policy attention should be called to two important innovations, viz, the simplification of the information on the charts, which has been in progress during the past five years, and the adoption of aluminum plates in place of lithograph stones, which has occurred within the same period. Their effect has been the production of more seniceable charts for the mariner and in less time than by former methods. In f net, but for these changes the several branches of chart work would be hopelessly in arrears. The old series of charts show a number of details, such as fences, woods, farm roads, indiYidual houses, etc., which are not of importance to the navigator and are of a transitory character. Their omission, besides expediting the construction of the chart, has the effect o:f showing more clearly the prominent land marks needed by the navigator. In addition, on new charts, both the hnchured land area and snnded water areaithave been simplified, with the result that the original drawing and engraving is reduced and subsequent corrections more easily made. Excepting the United States Lake Survey, all nautical chartproducing organizations construct their charts on the Mercator pro1ection. There is no practical difference except in high latitudes between the Mercator projection and the Polyconic projection, in so fur as the charts on a scale of 1 : 80,000 or larger are concerned, but the difference between the projections is appreciable for the smaller scales and is an objectionable feature of the old series of charts. The substitution of the foot for the fathom as the unit for soundings on charts o:f 1: 80,000 and larger scales which was decided upon during the past year has met with general approval. Two other objectionable features will be eliminated by the new series o:f charts, viz, the lack of orientation with the meridian and the maintenance of two depth units on the same chart. In planning the work of the division precedence has been given to new charts based on the new surveys o:f Alaskan waters, and in order to meet urgent demands preliminary charts have been issued. Next in importance has been the maintenance of existing charts up to date. Besidei:; the current corrections to the flates, the engraving section .is engaged in engra dng the new smal scale series of charts, the 1 : 400,000 on the Atlantic and Gulf coast and the 1: 200,000 on the Pacific coast, with a view of orienting them and l>utting them on the Mercator projection. Here also the policy o:f sunplification has expedited the work with advantage to the charts in the wav of clear~ ness, by brinЦing into prominence the more important details. The condit1on.s ?f the printing section have been greatly improved. In the sundry C1Vll act for 1915 Congress appropriated $12,500 fo~ an extension and rebuilding of one o:f the buildings o:f this sect10n. The bids on the first plans exceeded the amount appropriated and

142

REP01;T OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

new proposals had to be called for on revised plans. This caused a delay, so that construction was not started until November 12, 1914. On January 13, 191:), the one-story annex was compl<.'ted and on April 7 the new two-story building was completed. '\Ve haYe as a result a well-arranged and well-lighted printing hall IGO feet in length by 181 feet in width, in wluch are installed all the power presses now in use, with room for one or more additional offset presses, which it is hoped will be obtained in the near future. Above the west end of the printing hall is a second story, which affords a well-lighted room 78 by 18! feet for the chief printer's office and the lithographic transfer presses and other transfer equipment. Opening out of this room is a lithographic dark room of ample dimensions. There yet remains to be done the rearrangement and repair of the adjoining building, the installation of an elerntor, and the purchase of some additional equipment. The adYantage of a metal plate m place of stone was recognized in this office for a number of years, but the experiments were interrupted by the current work. From April, 1911, the process was pursued more thoroughly with such successful prog1иess that early m 1912 lithographic stones were entirely superseded by aluminum plates. Besides being cumbersome to handle, lithographic stones had the Jisadrnntage of requiring for a reprint of a chart the repetition of the whole process of transferring in the same manner as for a new subject, whereas the aluminum plates can be filed away the same as engraYed copper plates, and "иhen required taken out and printed after changes have been made to utilize information received subsequent to the last P.rintin~. The next aclrnnce will reqmre the acquisition of an offset press, which has been recommended for several years past. "\Vith this press the quality of the prints will be improved, the printing expedited, and the surface of the chart paper will not be such ai1 important consideration as it is with the flat-bed press. The increased information referred to in the preceding pages adds to the work of the lithographers in that before printing it has to be applied to the aluminum plates. As new charts are puulished each year, the lithographic work is being continuously increased from this source. In the photograph section both the bl11e print and photostat work has exceeded that of past years. The difficulty which arises is to meet the demand when a large quantity of material for reproduction is received with the request that it be made special. In order to obtain the best negati,иes for lithographs it is desirable to have an additional camera for negatives for bromide enlargements and restrict the present camera to large-scale work which will req11ire a minimum of focal change. The electrotype section has been charged with various duties. Besides the electrotyping, specifications have been prepared for repairs of b11ildings and for new equipment, the work of the contractors has been supervised, and the wiring of the buildings and other miscellaneous electrical work done. и

INSTRUMENT DIVISION,

The annunl report of the instrument division gives details 0Б work accomplished in that division during the year, including the general office work, the instrument shop, and the carpenter shop. The work of accounting for instruments, general property, and furniture has been attended to as heretofore, und, in addition, the necessary correspondence of the division has been kept up. The scientific part of the work in designing and constructing new instruments, apparatus, and various kinds of special experiments, with a view to improving apparatus or methods of construction, has been conducted as usual. The making and repairing of furniture, repairs to office buildings, packing and unpacking instruments and general property issued or received, and other special duties in connection therewith have been carefully attended to. There have been unusual demands on the clerical force and on the carpenter shop in connection with repairs and changes in the Survey buildings. The necessary work involved in preparing for condemnation and le or other disposition, instmments and general property worn out no longer needed in the Survey, was performed.
LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES,

The chief of the division of lib~ary and archives has charge of the general reference l!b:ary maintained by the Survey and also is the custodian of the ongmal sheets and field records. An inventory of the books and pamphlets was taken in August, 1914, and the number of books and pamphlets on the shelves or charged out was 22,549. . Five hundred and seventy-five books were sent to the Government J>rinting Office for binding and 161 additional books were prepared for binning. The publicntions of the Survey were rearranged with a view to making them more accessible. Bibliographies on various subjects were prepared. Many books and maps were borrowed from the Library of Ccngress as required for the use of the Survey. Books

and maps were loaned to the Library of Congress, the Carnegie Institution. and other offices and institutions. A list of all the maps in the library, arranged geographically, was prepared and a copy of this list was furnished to the mup division of the Library of Congress. The atlases were examined and those of no value to the Survey offered to the Library of Congress for the selection of such items as may be of use to that library. Many maps and charts were eliminated from the files and those of value transferred to the Library of Congress. The total number of charts on hand in October, 1914, was 11,181; the total number of maps on hand at the same date was 5,318; of blue prints 3,583. It is recommended that metal shelving be pro,иided for the valuable field, observatory, and office records, as a safeguard against fires. These records amounting to some 85,000 items are now arranged on wooden shelving.

TIDAL HESEARCII SECTION.

The reduction and tabulation of hourly current observations ta from seven light vessels on the Atlantic were continued. For the inside route pilot, Key West to New Orleans, tidal and 1 rent observations were reduced an<l results furnished. The curl tables contained in Part IV of the Atlantic Coast Pilot were pan checked and revised. The tides at Port Simpson, British Columbia. were predicted for the years Hl16 and ml 7 as a basis for current predictio.ns for Seymour Narrows. Current predictions for Sergius Narrows, British Columbia, were furnished for use in the tide tables for 1916. A computation in reference to the number of honrs of fog in certain localities for each month of the year for a number of years was made for the coast pilot section. Short series of current observations for Florida Reefs, Kuskokwim Bay, and Cook Inlet were reduced.
