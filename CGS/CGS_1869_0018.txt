COAST 8CRYE1 OFFICE,

I>. C., I>ece111bcr 20, 1869. SIR: Iu accordance with law, I ha Ye the honor to submit a report on the progreRs made in the surwy of tht> coasts of the United States during the ~-ear whieh ended with the month of No,·ember. ~With but two exct'ptions the work has been continued in nery seaboard State on the Atlantic coast, on the Gulf of l\foxico, and on the Pacific coast, and special operations of interest and Yalue haYe been conducted iu some of the interior States. Tuese will be alluded to in the brief recapitulation which will now be made of the sites of work. The progress of the parties sen~r:lll~- has been satisfactory, and has not been interrupted, except in the ca Re of a frw parties on th<· coast of Maine, that suffered deby in conHequence of the gn'at storm of the .'Ith of September, wliich destroyed the camps. The regular operations of the surn·y haw been eontiuued on the shore;.; of St. Croix River, 1\Iaine; in Penobscot Bay and the adjacent waters, and 011 Peuobscot Hirnr; on Kennebec RiYer; on the upper shores of Casco Bay; in the vicinit~- of Portland; an cl Oil the coast near Kennebunkport. The harbors between ]\fount Desert lslau<l and Boston l1;n-t· been speeial!~· examined with reference to the compilation of a Coast Pilot; and loeal exa111iuation;; haye lJecn made to determine questions concerning the light-house service in St. Croix HiYer; in Prospect Harbor, Maine; aml at Salem Harhor, Massachusetts. An astronomical party at Cam bridge cxclmnged star signalH with a party at Omaha, for determining differetH'c of longitmk hr tiJC telegraph. On this work, as a basis, the geographical positions of Springfield and .'.\Iattoon, in the State of Illinois; of Burlington and Des Moines, in Iowa; of Jnleshnrg·, Xorth Platte, and Bushnell, in .Nebraska; of Rawlings, in Wyoming Territory; Aun Arbor, in .Jlichigan; antl of Pitts· burg, in Pem1s.rlvania, have been actually determined. Adrnutage was taken of the very farnrable opportunity pre;.;ented by the total eclipse of the sun on the 7th of August to make such precise observatio 11s ns would be available for correcting the lunar elements. The party under my immediate direction obserYed at Spriugfiekl, lllinois; and three other parties of the Coast Survey made successful obsen-ations at Des l\loines, Imrn; Shelbyville, Kentucky; and Bristol, Tennessee. The results "-"ill doubtless give to the determination of difference of longitude, by the method of occultations and eclipses, those data which were needed for its perfection. All observations made by the naYigator for his position at se:i will become more efficient by the imprornments in the ta.bleR of the moon, whieh will arise from the correction of its elements. Resuming the notice of work on the coast in geog·raphical order, progress hm; been made in the detailed surve,y for a chart of Narraganset Bay; special examinations hm-e !wen made of the channels near Saudj- Hook; of those entering \Valla bout Bay; and of ); ew York II arbor: and the survey has been continued on the coast of New Jersey, near Atlantic Cit~-. A spedal examination bas been made of the light-houses, beacons, and buoys in Cllesapea'.;:c Rty, as a system of aids for navigation. \Vork has been continued in the surYey of the lower rstuaries of the Chesapeake; in the main triangulation near Washington CitJ-, and in that passiug southward from Uape Ilenr;r, for which also a base line has been measured near Norfolk, Virginia; in soundings off the seacoast below Portsmouth, North Carolina; in Pamplico Sound and on the shores of its branehes in the vicinity of Pamplico Hiver; on the bar and channels of Charleston Entrance, South Crirolina; on the coast of South Carolina between Port Royal aud Savannah; on the coast. of Georgia, at 'Wilmington Rh·er and Skiddaway Island; along the inland water passages below the Ogeechee; on Altamaha Sound and its branches; in the water passages between that sound and 8t.

the bar ancl in the channels leading to St. Andrew's Sound and to Fernandina Harbor, Florida; in the Gulf Stream off the :Florida Peninsula ; on the Gulf coast 1 at St Andrew's Bay and westward of Pensacola Eutmnce; on the islands and in the waters of Isle au Breton Sound, Louisiana; and in Corpus Christi Ba~-, Texas. 011 the Pacific coa:st the survey has been prosecuted in four sites of work on the shores of the Sau ta Barham Chaunel. The longitude 0£" San Francisco has been determiued by the telegrnphic method, iu co1111ection with Salt J,ake City and other points to the eastward. The series of stations used in this dt>termination lun-e been already mentioned. Work bas been continued on the coast of California, near Cape l\1endociuo; on the coast of Oregon, near Port Orford; and on the Columbia Hi,er; an<l in Washington Territor;r, on the shore of the Strait of Fuca, at Port Discovery. The solar eclipse of A ngnst last was obsern·d b,r a part.r on the Uhilkaht Ri\-er, in Alaska, and some oh~ervatious of value were obtained, though the weather was unfavi:irable. Taking the opportunit~-, the obser»ing party determined a number of geogr:iphical positions before rctuming to San Francisco. ()harts of all the principal harbors on the coast of Alaska han\ been compiled from the best information as yet available, and have been issued from the offii~e. r1'1 other respects the drawing aud engra,ing han\ kept pace with the progress of the field-work. A comprehensive 'iew of the distribution of the field parties upon the coast of the United States dm'ing the ;\-ear is gh-en in .Appendix No. 1. ESTDIATES. The estimates for continuing the work of the survey during the fiscal year 18i0-'71 were transmittt'd to the department at the end of September last. They will be stated here in detail, as usual, with the remarks theu made in explanation of' the several items. 'fhe estimates for the Atlantic coast do not much exceed those of preceding years. Recent appropriations han· bern reductions from the estimates so large as scrionsl.r to embarrass the operations of the sur\·ey. The estimates han been carefolly re\·ised, with strict regard to economieal considnatious and the thorough efficiency of' the servicr. They are offered with conthience that tl11;,y will hear minute and rigid scrutiny. The 11ecessit,v for the addition of $21,000 to the estimate ot' last ~-ear for the Atlantic coast arises from the increased outlay which is rec1nired to restore the field of operations in the southern sections to a proper working condition. The augmentation of $100,000 in the estimates for the Pacific coast is small in comparison with its rapidly i11crealiing dt·\·elopment in wealth, population, and commerce, whic11 demand a proportionate increase i11 all the facilities for navigation. It is especially incumbent upon the Coast Survey to make immPdiate prm-ision for the supply of all the needful charts. The item for the rt>pairing of vessels i8 reduced by $15,000 from the estimates made for that ol~ject last sear, in the expPCtation that some pro\'ision will already have been made for the supply of uew vessels in the deficiency bill before the estimates now presented can receive the consideration of Congress. The item is, lrn".VeYer, greater than tlie appropriation of last year, on accouut of the enhanced cost of repairs and the growing age of the vessels. No estimate is here proposed for the extension of the sur,e.r to the coast of Alaska. If it should be thought proper by Congress to direct such an ext~nsion, an additional appropriation would be req ni,.;ite.

In such a ease it is nothing less than a dnt_y owing to ciYilization that everything in our power aml witl.Jin our me:ms should be done to make the ouservations as complete as possible. On the part of the Coast Surve;y, arrangements for obserYiug this edipst~ were made primarily and chiefly with a view to obtaining ohserrntions of precision for the purpose of correcting the clements of the lunar tables. Such observations include t.he times of contacts near the central line of the eclip8e, from which times the coincidence of the sun's and moon's centers in longitndl' is obtained; the duration of totality near the edges of the shadow from which its precise Iimit.11, and hence the moon's position in latitude, are derived, as well as the moon's diameter. Fartliermore, from observation of the contacts at stations widely apart on the central line, yet referable to each other by their true geographical positions, a value of the moon's di8tance from the earth mas l)e inferred free from certain sources of error by which ordinary observationR are affected.

The report on tlw Rnl~ject was transmitted without delay to the chairman of the J,ight-house Board. This party passed the earl.'· part of the .\'('ar on the eoa1<t of Gcorg·ia, and has nmY resumed dutJ· in Section V.

Hydrography of Isle au Haut Bay, JJaiue.-The hJ·drogra1,hic se1Tice performed in Isle au Haut Ila,\· was dune in the latter part of the working seasou, terminating on the 23d of October, by the party of Assistant Charles J uuken, in the steamer Endeavor. The part of the bay sounded (Sketch No. 2) lies between Eagle Island on the north, and Brimstone Island on the south. Eastward the soundingi> were extended from North Haven and Yinal Haven as far as Deer Island, and to the southward of it somewhat further. 'Within the limits of the work done this .\·ear the principal ledges dewloped are the following: Saddleback Rock Ledge, with four feet at low water, about a mile from Sadclleback lig·ht. Fox Island Reef, with twent~·-two feet at low water, a mile and a half from the same light.house. The statistics of this work will be given in aggreg·ate, with the notice of work done by the same party under the next head. Only the midule part of the bay was sounded, leaving for future development the parts adjacent to the sl1ore-line of iislands which bound the bay. Of most of theise the outlines ha>e not yet been traced. Hydrography of Rurrieane Sound and appmaches, Penobscot Entrance, jlfaine.-This work connects with the hydrogmphy of Vinal Bave.n, which was done last year by the party of .Assistant Junken. The ~undings were resumed on the 22d of July, and after including Hurricane Sound, (Sketch No. 2,) and, connected with it, "The Reach," which passes into lsle au Haut Bay, they were extended westwarcl to the Yicinity of M6nroe Island, where a junction was made with the hydro. graphic work of the present season done by .Assi$tant 'Webber. About a' mile and a half east. southeast from the island just named, the depth was found to be 84~ fathoms, which is more than has been found elsewhere in Penobscot Bay or in its approaches. Numerous ledges lying between the Bay Ledges and Vinal Ha>en were developed. One of these is a mile and a quarter south of

Prospect Harbor light.-In order to meet a question proposed from the Light-house Board in regard to the necessity for re-establishing the light formerly nrnintaiucd at Prospect Harbor, on the coast of Maine, Assistant Junkeu made an examination of the place in October. As a harbor of refuge for vessels coming from the eastward, Prospect Harbor is of consider,1ble importance. The re-establishment of the light was, in consequence, recommended, and the reasons therefor haYc been made known to the Hght-housc Board. Hydrogmphy of Penobscot Bay, Jfainc.-At the upper limit of the work mentioned in a preceding notice, Assistant F. P. 'y cbber, with a party in the scl10oner .Tost>ph Henry aml steam lau11eh Sagadahoc, took up, and extended northward, the soundings in J>enobscot Ifay. The work done (Rkctch No.'.:) makes the hydrograph~· continuous between the Fox hlands and tlie harbors of Camden and Rockland. Tides were obserrnd in the first named lrnrbor wllilc thr sonIHlillgf; were in progress. On the lines run, depths were found varying from 20 to as much as 66 fathom~. Yt>r~· few sunken ledges were de·eloped, but seYeral that are partly bare at low water. Of the.~e, Carr's, or Eg·g l':-ock Ledge, was found to be in only 4 feet at low water, and Compass faland Lt"dge in 7 feet of water. These are small, and run up in points, and, haviug d<'ep water inunediakl~· about them, must be regarded as dangerous. Sub-Assistant F. D. Granger was attached to the hydrographic party, and prosecutctl work in charge of the launch. Mr. R B. Palfrey ser>ed as aid. Soumlings were couunenced ou the 22d of July, and closed on the 18th of October, with the following result in statistics: Signals erected.............. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..... - . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The office work of the Jlarty was kept up, as far as possible, with the work afloat, and soon after the vessels returned to Portland, the resulting hydrographic sheet was forwarded to tl1e office. This party had passed the early part of the year in service in Sertion VIII, and preparations have been made to resume the work which was discontinued there on the approach of summer.

Coast Pilot, from Penobscot Bay to Bost-On Harbor.-The ad\·ance toward completion, of the l'Jurvey of the .Atlantic Coast and harbors intervening hr.tween Penobscot Entrance and Boston now warrants the issue of a comprehensive publication for the benefit of all who may have occasion to navigate the coast of New England. As ports on other parts of. the coast become connected in the progress of the bydrography, it is intended to issue Coast Pilots of the character now to be brought under notice. The duty of preparing the manuscript for tlie Coast Pilot of Section I was assigned to Assistant J. S. :Bradford, and on that he was engaged from November, 1868, until the latrer part of June of the present year, under the immediate supervision of the hydrographic i11spcct-0r. Instructions H. Ex.

were then given to Yeri(1 the manuscript directions which Mr. Bradford had prepared by personal inspection of the ports and sailing lines. No vessel belonging to the Coast Survey being available, the schooner S. L. Morgan was hired for the service, and was accompanied by her owner as sailing rna.ster. Tims prm·ided, Assistant Bradford proceeded from Boston eastward along the coast, and visited every harbor of' consequence as far in that direction as the entrance to the Penobscot. The sailing tlil'cctions which he had compiled were carefully verified, as also the descriptions of the coast and shore foatnres. Such errors as became evident were corrected; and what showed as omissions on the published charts were noted and supplied. The buoy system in each of the harbors was incidentally examined, aml separate note8 were made in regard to them for the information of the Light·house Board. It is a gratifying proof of the accuracy of detail with which our topographical maps have been made, that in cml~· rare iustauces did l\Ir. Bradford find occasion to alter, from personal observation, the previously written descriptions of islands and shores which he visited for the first time aft.er tl1e eompilatiou of the manuscript, and for which he had no other data than maps in the Coast Surny Office. In addition to his general duties in this section, l\Ir. Bradford made a special examination of Salem Harbor, l\lassaelmsctts, with reference to the uecessity for a light.house on Fort Point. His report in faxor of the establishment of an additional light was transmitted to the Light-house Board before the close of' August. Scituate Harbor, Massachusetts, was also examined to determine the expediency of relighting the Scituate light ~tower. After completing the verification of the Coast J>ilot, on the coast of }faiue aud New llampshire, l\fr. Bradford returned witlt his party to Ilmiton, and during the remainder of' the season made a thorough examination oi' Boston JJay and Harbor, with referenee to the descriptive featurc8. This inclut1et1 also Town ltiver, and "\Ye:ymouth Fore and Back l~h'ers, above tlte drawbridgeH. Ou the Hlth of Oetol>er work was cloHt~d in t11e field. Assistant Bradford then repaired to the Uom;t SmTey Office, where h(' is now engag·ed in lnfogiug up the results of the season's operatious, and iu preparing· the mamrntript of a Coast Pilot, which will be descriptive of the coast between Boston aud Nm\' York. The imminent peril in which the schooner Morgan was placed by the great storm which ranged th(' coast of New E11glarnl on the evening of the 8th of September, elicited a conspicuous instance of personal intrepidity. At !) p. m., the storm haying raged about one hour, the starboard anchor chain snapped, and the vessel dragged swiftly to the ice-house wharf in Deep Cove, George's l{i,'cr, l\faine. Tile stern-boat of the Morgan struck against the piling, and was clashed into splinters. At a moment of the greatest peril, l\fr. Lucien B. Wright, one of the aids in the party, climbed along the main boom, and, at the risk of his life, reached the wharf with the end of a line. "\Yheu this was clonP, the boom was sweeping across the dock, sometimes ten feet above it, and sometimes coming violently down to within a few inches of the planking. Assistant Bradford passed by the stern davits as the Yessel swung in, and jointly they succeeded in hauling ashore a six-inch rope and making the schooner fast. This was after 10 p. m., at which time the force of the storm was such as to make it impossible to stand anywhere on t.he wharf. Assistant Bradford and Mr. 'Yright, on their hands and knees, performed the important service of securing the vessel fore and aft. The Morgan was the only vessel then in the vicinity that was not blown on shore, high and dry. Topography of George's Ril'cr, l'Iainc.-Thc camp of Assistant F. W. Dorr, who was directed to survey the entrance of George's River, was pitched at Deep Cove, in the middle of July. A few miles of the neighboring shore line had been traced by Assistant Hosmer in 1867, but none of the details had been mapped. Mr. Dorr at once took up the survey of the lower part of the river, and so prosecuted the work as to connect very satisfactorily with the survey previously made to the eastward by Assistant Dennis in the Yicinity of Mosquito Harbor, and with that of Assistant Hosmer, which includes the western side of George's River. The survey of Mr. Dorr embra-0es both shores of the river, (see Sketch No. 2,) from the Lower Narrows to its mouth; and also Gay's, Teal's, Bar, Eagle Island, and Great and Little Caldwell Islands, which lie off the entrance to the river. The topographical sheet includes also the northeastern shore of Herring Gut Harbor and Mosquito Island. The shore line traversed, like

most on the coast of :Maine, is rocky, rough, and very irregular. Except near the main roads the interior is covered with a stunted growth of trees. The elevations are abrupt and without any approach towards regularity. As a consequence their representation by the customary method of curyes proved difficult and tedious. vVith the notable exception which will be alluded to before the close of this notice, the weather throughout the season was unusually fine, with less than the ordiuary occurrence of fogs and wind. The field-work was closed on the 1st of October. A synopsis of statistics is llere given, as taken from the report of Mr. Dorr: Shore-line surveyed _. _. _.. _. _.... _....... _................. _.......... 5::! miles.

De Wees, in consequence of thr ill health of ::\fr. Dorr during the former part of the season, was assigned to the party in August, and subsequently he conducted the plauetable survey. l\'.lr. G. O. Schaeffer, jr., served as aid. The party was preYiom;ly employed in S1'ction IV, and will be engaged iu the same section during the ensuing winter. The camp of Assistant Dorr suffered considerably from the fnrious g:1lc of the 8th of September, which, as in other places where it ragerl, struck without warning at 9 o'clock in the eveni11g. Three of the tents were prostrated instantly, and those not blown a\\·ay were more or less damaged before they could be taken do'i\n, The sea broke in a solid mass owr the wharf adjoining the camp, and one of the ice-houses on it was blown dmn1. SeYeral houses and barns in the immediate neighborhood were shattered by tho force of the storm. It is the general testimony of assistants serving in this section that on no part of the Atlantic or Gulf com;t hm·e they at any time experienced a storm of greater force or more sudden in its action. Topography near South Thomaston, Jlfaine.-The party of Assistant Dennis, before taking the field in tlie Yicinity of the northeastern boundar.r, completed a sheet of topography which 'i>as left unfinished at the close of last season. This includes the eastern side of George's Ri>er, iu the neighborhood of South Thomaston, and employed the party from the 1st until the !!5th of July. The sbore-liue had been prHionsly traced, as was mentioned in my report of last ~·ear. In the early part of the present year :Ur. Dennis and bis aid, J\lr. Tittmann, were on duty in Section Y, and tlie mention of their seryice will be found under that head. The part,y has re~mmed work on the southern coast. Topography and hydrography of the .Kennebec Rii·er, ..:lfaine.-Early in August .A.ssistant O. II. Boyd took up the plane-table survey of the shorf's of the Kennebec, on )[errymeeting Bay, in the vicinity of the mouth of the Androseoggin, (Sketeh ~o. 2,) 'where he> joined with the topography of a previous season. Provision was made at the same time for commencing the hydrography as soon as shore-line could be furnished. ObserYations were made on the currents, and lines of levels were run between the tide-gauges. When these preliminaries were complete, the shore-line surwy and details of topography were extended up the riv-er. One plane-table sheet having been filled, the soundings were made corresponding to it; and thus the work was pushed upward till the 6th of November, when the survey was closed for the season at a point above Hiehmond . .Assistant Boyd was aided in this section by 1\fr. ,T. G. Spaulding, and in the latter part of tho season by l\'.lr. J. Hergesheimer. The results of work are expressed in the following statistics: 70m1les.

The plane-table sheet includes Swan Island, in the Kennebec. At the outset of the surYeying season Mr. Boyd was engaged in duty that will be mentioned nuder the head of Section VIII. Ile is now about to return to the same field of ser\·ice.
Topography of Merwoneag Bound, (Casco Bay,) ,lfai1w.-Tbe detailed plane-table survey of the shores of Casco Bay has been essentially completed by Assistant A. W. Longfellow. After setting

12

up the requisite signals, he resumed work on the 8th of July, with a party in tlie schooner Meredith. The western side of Sebaskahegau Islaml was surveyed, and the marg·in of the main larnl north of it in the direction of Brunswick. Ou the same sheet are represented the surface featnres of the shores of l\foriconcag, or Harpswell Sound, and the topography of the head of l\fohlle Bay, of Long Heacl1, and of Ewin's Narrows, the shore-line of which was furnished in advance for the use of the hydrographic party. The character of the topography, as represented by the plane-tahlc sheet, is quite intricate. In general reference to it, the followfog remarks occur in the report of ::\fr. Longfellow: ''The mica slate formation, characteristic of the coast of l\faine, gives directly the form an<l. relief of the ground, being >ery thinly coYered with soil. The stratification stands nearly Yertical, or upon its edge, forming long, narrow, parallel ridges, rising sometimes to an elevation of two hundred feet, and, being mostly wooded, these ridges offer great obstacles to the to· pogrnpher. The direction or treud of the strata on Sebaskahegan, and on the shores of New Meadows Rirnr generally, is true north and south, showing in this respect a marked deviation from its direction in the southern part of Casco Bay, as about Portland, where the course of the strata is with uniform precision northeast and southwest. This shows, in a distance of 0111~- twent,y miles, a deflection of the rock strata of forty-fh-e degrees toward the north. "On the remarkable island of Sebaskahegan, as at Phipsburg and West Bath, on the east shore of Xew Meadows River, there is much intrusion of coarse granite through the slate formiug the summits, which m0tlifies but does not soften the contour of the riUges, only rendering them IllOI'C rough anu broken. "The continuity of 1lirectio11 of the rock strata in Casco Bay is a marked feature, and is well shown upon the published Coast Sunrey chart, where the entrances from the ocean aucl the somHls are seen to be simply breaks through the parallel mica slate walls. This persistence of direction also inuientes to the hydrographer wliere to look for the extension of reefs and shoals under water.~, The party continued in the field until the 11th of November, when the details of the plane-table sl1eet were completed. The shore-line had been traced in a previous season, and is marked on the Progress Sketch No. 2. Hydrngrriplty of Ewin'.~ Xarro1rs, Long Reach, anil Doughty'.~ C011e, (Casco Bay,) Jlfaine.-.At the end of June Sub-Assistant Ilorace .Anderson reached Harpswell, and after setting up a title-gauge, somule<l out Bwin'R Narrows, and the adjacent waters of the upper part of Casco Bay, kuown as Long Reach, and Dought;y's CoYe, and also the deep channel between the Hench and Gurnet Bridge. This channel is narrow and intricate, and can be used by no vessels larger than fishing boats. .A second tide-gauge set up at l·'lyiug Point, to the westward, was watched for twelve hours in ohscrYation:o; simultaneous with those at Ewin's Narrows, after which high and low waters were obsernd at Flying Point during tliirty days. :Meanwhile Mr· .Anderson made the soundings needed in 1\Iaqnoit Day and 1\Iiddle Bay, completing the hydrography on the 24th of July. Mr. W. IL Steams ·ms employe1l in this work temporarily as recorder. .Assistant Longfellow furnished the plane-table pointi'l needful for sounding.

Special HW"'l.Jey of Portland Harbor, 1lfaine.-This minute suryey, for which means were provided by tl1e city authorities of Portland, has been completed, and the sheets, on a large scale, are well advanced in the bands of t11e draughtsman. Assistant J. A. Sullivan resumed the subsidiary triaugulation on the 10th of May, and continued uninterruptedly during the season the determination of points required for the topographical and hydrographic work, which was taken up in t11e middle of July. 1\Iention will be made presently of the detailed plane-table surveys by Assistants J.

IIe then took np field dnty with the plane-talik, and lH'osrented the topographical surYey until the 9th of October, suspending it at that dak kn1porarily for the completion of a sheet of work, of which mention has been made uml<'r a prercllin;:hea<l. After resuming at Portland, .Assistant Hosmer continued the detailed snrYe~·. and fille<l the three to11ogTaphical sheets which had been pr~jecte<l for him by the 13th of Sovem lwr. The1'e represent, in full detail, the central and northwestern part of the city, the uorth shon· of Da<"k Coye, and the shore of Cape Elizabetl1 between the Rug J,ight-housp aml Port1a111l BridgP. ThP shore line of Back Cove wa8 traced, by the aid of }Ir. J\icCliutock, dnriug the ab8euee of .A:,;:-;istant Hosmer at Thoma8ton, Maine. Before taking up service at Portland Mr. Hosmer had been emplO;\'Cd in field duty in St·ctiou II, and earlier in Section V. Ile iR now under instructions to resume topogrnphica1 work on the coast of South Carolina. The expenditures incurred in prosecuting the special snrYey at Portland were defrayed by the city anthoritiei;. Assistant Donn commenced work with the plane-table in the mi(ldle of July, and snrvpyr!l the part of the city which lies along Fore Rh'er and the canal basin. Here the contour of the ground was carefully determined by leveling, and the curves trace1l on the topograpl1iea1 sheets show the surface ele1ations. Two large maps were thus filled with det.ail,,, A third shePt contains .Mr. Donn's survey of the northwestern part of the city. He traced also the shore line of Portlaml Harbor on the south side from Portland Bridge to the railroad bridge, and both banks of tl1e Fore River an1l Stromlwater, for the use of the hydrographic party. J.\lnch of the ground represented by the first two sheets is greatly broken, and the topographical details arc, in cons1;q ueuee, exceed. ingly intricate in character. Their successful delineation is strong eYi(lencc of the completeness of the method adopted at the outset of the sun·ey. After inking his plnue-taulc sheets Assistant Donn resumed duty in Section Ill, where he had been previously engaged. The hydrography needed for the completeness of the i:<pccial surrnr "·as eomlucted by Sub_ .Assistant Anderson, after the completion of sonnclingR in the upper part of Cas<:o Bay. At Port. hmd three tidal stations were e8fablished about the middle of .August. Nearly twenty tltousal!(l soundings were made and recorded. These fill four hydrographic sheets, of which three reprel'ent the Fore River and Stroudwater, and another the Back Cove. The hydrography was fini:;hcd on the 11th of October.

The use of the lines going westward from Cambridge was given in the accnstome<l spirit of liberality by the officers of the ·westem Union Telegraph Company, on the application of Assistant George 1V. Deau, whose ultimate station for observing was at Salt Lake City, in "Ctah Territory. At San Francisco Assistant George Dayidson procured the use of tlie telegraph line going eastward across the continent. Assistant Edward Goodfellow was stationetl at Omaha, in Nebraska. Operations at the points intermediate between the coasts will be rccitPd in notice:.; of work done in Sections VIII, IX, an<l X. For the present notice will be taken of the ob:,;errntions made at Cambridge, as best conforming to the geographical order of the work in this and in lll'CYions annual reports. Assistant Mosman was ai(led at that station by Sub. Assistant F. lllake, jr. Clock signals were successfnl1;1· exchanged on the night of the 7th of February, between the observers at Cambridge aml those at Omaha and Salt Lake City, and in the course of the month follomng that date signals were exchanged on ten nights between Cambridge and San Francisco. During the same inkrrnl eight nights were clear for observing at Salt Lake City, and seven nights for exchanges bet'i\ecn Cambridge and Omaha. George F. :Milliken, esq., superintendent of the lloc;tou office of the 1Yestern Union Telegraph Company, and Mr. John Wright, one of the oper· ator;.;, f;'ave their personal assistance at the Cambridge obsen·atory, and much of the success that markl·rl thP operations is due to their untiring patience and perseverance. In :uh1itioH to the exchanges for difference of longitude, experiments were made on two nights through a doul.i1c line of wire joining Cambridge and San Francisco, to determine the time of transmission, thirtPen wpeaters being interposed in the circuit. These trials were repeated on a night in April, anll otbPrs for Yelocity were made under the direction of Professor Winlock through a single wire, a simple pemlulum beating seconds having been placed in the main circuit'.

Early in the period employed by the company in perfecting arrangements, I received a e<mrnmtii· cation from Sir James Anderson, asking for information in regard to a snitable Amcrir;au terminus for the new cable, and citing the coast of l\Iassachusetts as a desired general location.

The salient points, as at Uape Ann arnl Cape Cml, were deemed object tionable; the first, on account of its rocky shores, and because of tlw uueYen ledgy ground smrounding it; the second, by reason of its exposure and shifting sands, and the contingent auchorage of vessels in its vicinity. Massachusetts Bay, for the shelter afforded in nearing the coast, was considered more favorable, but the northern part of the bay from Cape Ann to Scituate docs not present the desired ground.

'Yltiting found a position in which sernral of the clesired conditions coucurred, bnt in the final choice of a location all the details of the inquir;y were brought to a test. Duxbury Beach is the nmthern arm of Plymouth Harbor. L;ying off the beach are two rocky i;hoals knmrn as "High Pinc Lt·dgc '' and "Ilowlaud'i; Ledge.'' ·while these ledg·es sene as warnings to keep away from the coast, they abo serve as a shelter to the beach abreast of them, which is soft, smooth, sandy ground, without rocks and without shi11gle. The slope of the bottom from the beach at Duxbury to the mrn1 bed of :Massaclrnsetts Bay is an e\'en and regular decline. The course to sea is almost due cast, passing· betwren the "Race Point" of Cape Cod and the south end of Stelhrngen's Bank, so as to dear George's Bank, which is still further out. These great adnmtages Mr. vVhiting found to be strt'ngthcned hy the fact that a mound, affording a gootl lookout, occms about mid way between the two protecting lPdges before mentioned. The mound known aR Rouse's Hummock is a conspienons oqject, and in order to preserve it as a local landmark, it had been in a preYiomi year purcl.rnscd by the town authorities of Duxbury. ThP publiRhed charts of the CoaRt SiuYPY showing the seaward approach to D11xlmry, together with the needful copieR or tracings from the original field sheets of that Yiciuit.\·, were furnished to the inquiring parties. ·with this data the ca hle fleet was enabled to approach the coast, pasi:; Cape Cod, and steer directly for Duxlmry Beach without the aid of a pilot.

Sub-Assistant Ogden has been designated as one of the suneying party v;-hich will attend thP expedition.
Tidal Obse1Tations.-At the new tidal station on one of the Fox Islands in Penobscot Bay, preparations ha,-e been made for recording the tides with a self: registering gauge, where tl1c depth will be five or six feet deep at low water. A wharf has heen extended out, supported by two strong piers, and a tide-gauge of improved construction is nearly completed in the workshop of the Coast Survey, to be set in lllace by Captain A. C. l\Iitchell. The position being favorable, every effort will be made to secure a goo(l series of tidal observations at this stntiou, and t-0 overcome, as far as possible, the difficulties experienced in cold latitudes by freezing, the continuity of observations having heen in that way frequently inteITupted. The self-registering tide-gauge at the Boston Navy Yard is still in charge of Mr. H. Howland, who has,. kept up the series well, except_:in winter, when it was often stopped by ice. Many tides have thus been lost. The series of met.eorological observations is continued at that station, as also experimental observations with the new devices proposed to resi.st.the effects of freezing. Between these and other permanent stations short series of tidal observations are made, as H. Ex. Doc. 206-3

Navy Yard Site, New London, Gonnecticut.-Tbe survey of a site for a navy yard near New London for the Nav.r Department was prosecuted,.under the general charge of Assistant H. L. ·whiting, during parts of the months of May and June. This work required the revival of the local triangulation and the determination of new points as a basis for the desired topography and hydrography. The triangulation was made by Assistant Charles Hosmer, and although not extending over a large area, complex and difficult details were involved. The results were such as would meet all possible requirements in accuracy. The topography, by Sub-Assistant H. G. Ogden, consisted of an elaborate survey of the grounds of the proposed navy yard, which extend about a mile along the river side. The topographical features were mapped on the large field scale of n"'o-o, and show the results of a series of lines of level in squares of one hundred feet, covering the whole map. Horizontal planes for each six feet of elevation were also determined by the level throughout the ground of the survey. Ttle hydrography was executed by Assistant Charles Junken, on the scale of the plane-table surwy. Soundings were carried across the bed of the river in lines continuous from the series of stations used hy the topographer in determining the level. These, as before stated, were one hundred feet apart. Lines of soundings to intersect were then run at distances of one hundred and fifty feet from each other, their direction being controlled by signals, stakes, and buoys, determined in position b;y means of the plane-table. The channel and riyer bed within the limits of the grnuml surveyed were thus developed with great accuracy. The parties employed at New London had been previously on duty in Section V, and subse· quently were engaged in service of which mention has been made under the head of Section I. Early in October three maps on the large scale of the survey were transmitted to the Navy Department, sl10wing the navy yard site at New London. These are marked with longitudinal and cross sections of the surface contour, and comprise all the data needed in advance of preparing the site for its proposed use. New York Harbor.-The increase in the commerce and population of the cities situated upon New York Harbor has taxed to the utmost the natural facilities of the neighborhood, and it has become evident to merchants and others that new resources must be sought for future expansion. The insular position of Manhattan Island, with its bold water-fr0nts upon the Hudson and East l~ivers, rendered it peculiarly favorable for the accommodation of a commercial people for many years, and the proximity of favorable sites for business places and dwellings on thsi .Brooklyn and Jersey City shores relieved for a long time the overwhelming population and business of the central city. But the time has come when the narrow avenue to the iround is overcrowded with vessels, when the ferries fail to supply a.clequate accommodation for transit, and when the

distances from centres of business to the homes of the merchants h:n-e become iuconwnient with the present means of transportation. The docks arnl -wharves, thus far of the simplest and most economical description, no longer meet all the wants of the shipping, and the contest for suitable berths has become a burden upon trade. Many citizens of foresigllt aml public spirit in each of the three cities have for years been impressed with the necessity for pro-i-iding against these increasing difficulties; but the problem is so vast, and tlle interests i'iO varied and ,apparently incompatible, that no solution has yet been offered which gives satisfaction to all. In the early part of the present year George W. Dow, esq., a rnercllant doing business in New York, laid before the Chamber of Commerce a plan for dock8 and causeways iu the East River, which he conceived would at once supply the wants of shipping and the means of transit between New York and Brooklyn, as well as furnish a remelly for the injurious charactr of the strong currents which the present open passage between the harbor and tlle sound admits. The Chamber, at his suggestion, referred the matter-so far as it involved })llysical effects upon the harbor-to the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, by the following resolution: Resolution of Ohartiber of Oonimerce passed March 4, 1869.-"\Vhereas there is an apparent change going on in the formation of the harbor of N e\v York and its entrance, wllic~, if not soon attented to and corrected, threatens to be productive of very great injury to its commerce, even to the closing of the Sandy Hook Uhannel for large vessels, and the making of the Hell Gate Channel deeper, with swifter outward current, and even more difficult to stem or O"rercome, and more clangerous than at present, and, in fact, making this channel the main outlet for the waters of the ocean fiood tides and the North River; therefore, Resolved, That the attention of the Superintendent of the D'nited States Coast Snrvf'y, at Washington, be called to this subject with a request that he will give it his early and serious consideration, and cause· such examinations and resurveys to be made as the case may require, and also suggest such corrective measures as may seem best to prevent the threatened evils to this harbor. In response to this resolution I asked for a committee of conference1 and the Chamber of Commerce took action upon my request as follows : Resolutions of April 14, 1869.-Whereas Professor Benjamin Peirce, Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey, to whom was referred the resolution of this chamber passed on ilie 4th ultimo, in relation to tides and currents of New York Harbor, having expressed by letter of 7th instant a desire for a committee of conference to meet him and his associates, Captain C. P. Patterson and Assistant Henry Mitchell, to consider the subject of said resolution; therefore, Resolved, That a committee of three be appointed for that purpo8e. Resolved, That the secretary of this Chamber communicate this resolution -with the names of the committee to Professor Peirce, and inform him that the committee will meet him and his associates, in accordance with his wishes, either at the rooms of this Chamber or at such other place as he may prefer, leaving the day and hour to his discretion. The committeee appointed under the above resolution consisted of George W. Dow, esq., George W. Blunt, esq., andR. W. Weston, esq. Our :first meeting was held in New York, upon the 23d day of April, 18ti!l, and opened by Mr. Dow, with a full exposition of his plan and his views of its bearing upon the conserrntion of the harbor. Captain Patterson, hydrographic inspector, and Mr. Mitchell, who has in charge the ph~'sical hydrographyof the survey, stated that the apprehensions refl<>cted in the preamble of the re;iolntion of March 4 were not, as far as they were advised, well founded; that the repeated sounding of the Coast Survey did not Ahow any decline in the channel depths o'"er the bar, and that, except. the changes in the immediate neighborhood of Sandy Hook 1 no injurious tendencies a11peared iu the lower harbor. Mr. Dow hastened to assure us thtt't he was not tenacious of hiR plan, but presented it a8 a basis for our inquiries, which he hoped might leatl to a solution of the mnch-,·exPd questions of dock accommodation and transit between the two cities, with an imprm-emcut to the harbor generally, or at least with no injury to it in any direction. Upon this liberal footing I expressed my willingness to institute inquiries as far as the data in our possession would allow, and stated that if these data were inadequate I should feel disposed

to ask Congress to appropriate fnm1s for further fie1d surveys, because I considered the problem presented one of national interest, whatever shape it might ultimately take. The East Rfrer is not simply a portion of New York Harbor; it is also a commercial highway between New England and the cities of the Hudson, and the west. The Coast Survey was a1ready in possession of a large numuer of tida1 observations maue in New York through a long term of years, and from these I made a mathematical computation of the effects upon the relative inflow and outflow that would follow the closing of the East IUver entrance by the plan proposed. This computation showed that a large decrease of the scouring power through the main channel woulu be consequent upon the loss of the East RiYer, which is strictly in accordance with the sagacious inferences of Mr. Mitchell. My computation assumed, however, that the waters were of the same uniform density throughout, and the result which I reached must be modified in its application to the case hy those of .:\Ir. l\Iitchell's physical survey, undertaken and partly executed in the years 1857-'i:IS. l\Ir. nlitchell's inductions from actual gaugings of the streams have led him to the most important discovery that by reason of the difference in the specific weights of the rin\r waters anu thf· sea, the former plays but a subordinate pa'l·t in the scour of the channels; and he argues from instances of tidelcss rfrers, like the Nile and the Daimbe, that the Hudson, unassisted by the tidal flowage, could not preserYe the present d!<ptlt upon the bar of New York. In the course of hi8 obserYations he discoYered that in the dry season the bottom of the main channel of the harbor, in the rmthway of the Hudson, is traYersed hy a nortlrwardly current, which at times is consfant throughout the day. The head of the river at such times is not sufficient to balance the greater weight of the sea water, so that a1thongh the higher fresh water overflows into the sea, the salt water of the ocean flows in below to restore the equilibrium. l\Ir, :Mitchell also pointed out the curious fact that. an increase of the river outfio" during his survey diu not increase, hut really diminished the scour, because as the flood tidal currcut was prevented. hy this outflow from carrying the sea water as high up the river as before, the waters on reaching the harbor were less mixed with those from the sra, anu being lighter took a more superficial course. IIis observations were made at all uepths, so that his statements reskd upon absolute facts. He also agreeu with me in the opiuion that 0Lse1Tations confined to dry seasons of the year may not represent the average conditions, and that the results from these would be greatly modified if' inquiries were to be conducted through periods of freshets. J\lr..Mitclwll showed, furthermore, that the sound entrance permitted a grand tidal circulation through the harbor which was felt upon the bar; that all the tiUe waters that escape to the sound, and all the waters that pass in the opposite direction, from the sound to the harbor, increase the flowage over the bar hy the same amount-an amount actually stated by him from careful gaugings. Nor was this point the result of any recent review of his observations, hut really one of the earliest facts that he had reached. In his paper upon Hell Gate, to be fo1md in the annual report of 1867, he had spoken of the circu· lation induced by the coexistence of two outlets as the " life blood of :New York Harbor." Again, it appeared from general groupings of his observations, that, independently of the daily tiues, a circulation through the harbor exists between the sea anu the ocean, due to the unequal effects of tlie moon's attraction and winds. Ile is inclined to think the winds play a i)rominent part in this circulation, since upon the shallow waters of the sound, those from the eastward, have a much greater effect in piling up the wat~rs to leeward than the.Y have upon the open coast, so that the fl.ow that they would cause would be predominant in one direction, i. southward through the harbor, and seaward over the bar. The cutting off of the East River would also tend to diminish the fl.ow of salt water into the harbor, so that the waters of the harbor would become fresher, and therefore more liable to the formation of ice. The freshening of the harbor would moreover increase the excess of the specific gravity of the sea water and strengthen the inward undercurrent. These suggestions must not be regarded as final conclusions. They present at the outset a strong array of facts in opposition to the proposed dams. But if they are sustained by a thorough investigation, there will be no undue effort to force the construction of the dams to the injury of the harbor. The construction has been proposed as a great public benefit, defended with the utmost ability and candor, and should not be rejected without a full examination of all the phenomena of the case. Under these impressions I addressed to the committee the following letter:

''The inestimable importance to our country of the harhor of :St>w York 1we<1s no demonstration.
A large proportion of the commerce '~f our Atlantic eoast, forPign or <1omestiP, passes through this port, so that ever.' citizen of the United States has a dire<'t interest in whatewr iYa.\ it may be benefited or injurell. Tlicre are few questions, therefore, which demaml moH' serious consid<"ration than its preservation. It is the harbor which constitnks ::Sew York. It is tlt<" harbor. with its extraordinar.r position, its unusual capacity, and its special c01n-P11iem'c' of acces:;;, wliich haH brought

together such an accumulation of men, treaRnre, and trade. ·wltateYer injury it may sufler is felt throughout tliis immense organization of which it is the center, anll is a blow at the body of the national wealth of America. "But this great combination of men and of wealth needs space in which to deYelop itself. There must be residences for all its 111em bers within reasonable distance of the business of the port. Hence it is a question of real interest to commerce, suverior to all priYate speculation, and worthy of the attention of the greatPRL merdiants, l1ow can all t11e larn1 within tl1e proper distance be rellllPred ai.-ailable to the necessities of trade~ :Xo triYial ob,;tacles nor unreasonable apprehensions should be permitted to embarrass the inquir.r; but, upon the other liall(l, it would be a most unjustifiable hreacl1 of trust to sanction any operation which woulu endanger the welfare of the harbor. "I gladly bear testimon;r to the camlor and franlmess with wliich tlie propositions haYe been presented for enlarging the territorial accornmodatious of Xew York, and tlie readiness arn1 fullness with which the paramount importance of the harbor ha;; lJeen reeognizet1. "\Ii thin four miles of the City Hall of);" ew Y Ol'k tliere is at least as much land, iu Brooklyn, as in .New York itself. The passage of the East Hinr by the ferry is always annoying, and sometimes seems to be dangc·rons. The consequence of the more difficult access is, that fe\T of the residences in Brookl;yn arc more than three miles from tlie Cir~- Hall in an air line; while many of those in New York arc more than five miles distant. "It lias heen proposed to construct a brillge oyer the East Riwr, so high that all na.-igation could pass under it; and it lrns also been proposed to tunnel LeneatL the riwr. The objections to both of these enterprises han~ been so great as 11itllerto to preyent their adoption. But the plan which is now submitted for connecting Brooklyn with New York is by dams whicll shall entirely cut off the fiow of }fast Rh·er. The argumenh:> in its favor ha rn been presented b~- Mr. Dow with exceeding ability, and an ingenious and imposing- array of facts. I hm-e entereu u1ion their di8cnssion with Captain Patterson, the hJ'llrographic inspector of the Coast Survey, and l\1r. l\Iitchell, who has the charge of physical bydrography in the sur\ey. Assistant l\Iitchell has instituted a series of preliminary obserYations upon the tidal currents of the harbor, and has derived, among other results of the highest significance, a discovery of inestimable importance in reference to all inquiries of this nature. He has ascertained that the currents at the lmttom of the deep channels are very seriously dependent upon the dift'erenre het1Yeen the density of the sea water and that of the water of the harbor. The first impression made upon me by these innstigatious and discussions is quite unfavorable to the project of the dam. I think that various danger~ are imminent upon its completion, and in our last meeting I yerball.r expressed to ~-ou m,y fears. nut I think you agreed with me that the matter was not yet ripe for public discussion, aud that there were too many doubtful points, to be decided by careful observation, before a final conclusion could be reoohed. It is evident that there should be a complete ancl exhausti\e invcstig-ation of the currents of the harbor in every stage. Such an inquiry is beyond the means at my disposal in the present restricted state of the appropriations for the Coast Surn~y. But it is so essential to the commerce of the country that I must belie;-e the next Congress will proYide for it, and I am confi. dent that yourselves and all merchants wili throw the weight of your influence in favor of its accomplishment. It must, however, take some time to complete the iu.-estigation, however a(lequate may be the appropriation, for it must extend over all seasons of the year, and for several successive years, and when the survey is completed and the facts collected it will require many dayl" or months of severe thought to organize them into a true theory and extract the truth which is in them. We must suft'er the delay with what patience we can. "\Ve perceive how finite we are "·hen

we have to consider an enterprise which involves all the future. Even in the next generation the commerce of New York will be, probably, tenfold what it is now. There will be ten times the tonnage of shipping to be provided for, and three times as large a population to liw and have their residenc(·S. The event which would be inconvenience to us would he disaster to them. For their sakes we cannot proceed too cautiously. I trust, therefore, that after reporting to the Chamber of Commerce our present state of progTess in the iuquiries submitted, you will find no difficulty in persuading them to retain the matter in our hands until definite conclusions can be legitimately reached.'' At our last meeting, held NoYember 24, we agreed to postpone the question till further data should be collected, and the Chamber of Commerce at a subsequent meeting, December 2, passed the following resolutions:

Resolutions of the Chamber of Comnm·ee of New York, adopte<l December 2, 18G9. Resolved, That the thanks of this chamber be tendered to Professor Peirce, Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey, and to his associates, Captain C. P. Patterson and Henry :Mitchell, for their intelligent and careful attention to its resolution of the fourth day of last March, and for the cautious and able manner in which they have thus far handled a subject of the highest importance t-0 our harbor and its commerce. Resoltied, That this chamber approyes of the suggestion of Professor Peirce for an appropriation from the Congress of the L nited States in order to make further inquiries and inyestigations into the condition of the tidal and riYer waters of New York Harbor, and urgently recommends such appropriation. Resoli,ed, That the committee already appointed to confer with Professor Peirce and his associates in this matter be rtltained by the chamber, in accordance with his request, for further interYiews and communications with them. Hydrography of Sandy Hook Cltannel.~, New York.-For such special uses as might be of importance to the United States engineer officer, General Newton, at Sandy Hook, Assistant F. F. Nes commenced soundings and current observations in that vicinity on the 29th of June. Tides were observed with a gauge stationed at the goYernment wharf from the 27th of June till the 12th of July. Marked changes were nf)ticed on Flynn's Knoll, as having taken place since soundings were preYiously made in that >icinity. The point making out from East Beacon (Sandy Hook) has also changed, as may be inferred from the record of soundings. The chart of Assistant Nes includes soundings made over the wreck of the steamer Scotland. The currents in the vicinity of Sandy Hook were obser-ved at four stations. In general statistics the results of this examination are as follows:

Hydrography of Wallabout Channel, New York Harbor.-This work, asked for as a basis for estimates in regard to deepening the channel, was taken up by Assistant Nes on the 30th of August. The required scale of the chart is quite large, (r}50 ,) and involved the necessity for close determinations, which were found difficult in consequence of the disturbance or loss of old triangulation points by subsequent changes and improvements in the vicinity of the navy yard. Mr. Nes established a base line on the ordnance dock, and from its ends observed on known points in :Kew York and Brooklyn, and thus determined the connection of his work with the hydrography of East Ri>er. For the soundings he was furnished with a boat's crew froni the receiving ship Vermont. The work was closed on the 16th of October, and is represented by the following statistics: Miles run in sounding. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22 Angles measured ........................................·................ 1, 896 Number of soundings ..................·.··.....................·.......· 2, OS3

A chart of the W allabout Channel has been completed and famished to the authorities of the New York Navy Yard. Hydrographic service performed by .Assistant Nesin the early part of the surYeying ,year will be noticed under the head of Section IV. · Triangulation and azimuth, coast of !few Jcrsey.-Iu my last report reference was made to the connection of the secondary triangulation along the coast of New Jersey with the primary work in the >icinity of ~cw York, and to the suspension of the final details on account of the illness of the assistant assigned to that duty. For completing the operation, and for the more extended one of verif~·ing the coast series from Sandy Hook to Absecom Inlet, .Assistant A. T. l\Iosman was assigned early in May, and commenced work in the field towards the middle of that month. By the 16th of July the anglf's of the first quadrilateral south of the line Chapel Hill, 11Iount Mitchell, were obsen·ed, a partial reconnaissance was made for the improyement of the triangulation between Long Branch and Squam; and the astronomical azimuths of two lines were determined, one at the northern and the other at the southern extremit,y of the triangulation. In this work se·en signals were erected and four stations (see sketch l\o. 5) were used for the measurement of horizontal angles. The azimuths of the two lines from Chapel Hill and Leedi!i Point were lletermined by 104 observations on three stars, near elongation. Sub.Assistant F. Blake, jr., was attached to this party. When the operations were closed, Assistant Mosman joinecl the party of Assistant Cutts, at Bristol, Tennessee, and l\lr. Blake reported for duty to .Assistant Dean, as will he mentioned under the head of Section VIL Both had been preYiousl~· engaged in Section I, and :l\Ir. Mosman subsequentl;r at another station in Section IY. Topogra1Jhy of Absecoin Inlet and vicinity, New Jer·sey.-The ground surveyed by the party of Assistant C. M. Bache includes Absecom Inlet and the coast line six miles below the entrance. The fast land along the beach is comprised in a strip somewhat less than a mile in width, iuside of which is the great hody of marsh peculiar to the seaboard of New Jersey. Besides the main coast road, of which a stretch of about nine miles is represented on the plane-table sheets, some slight eleyations were found, the:contour lines showing in some places a height of thirty feet. Fieldwork was commenced on the 12th of July, and was continued until the 11th of NoYemher. Sub-assistant H. ~Y. Bache joined the topographical party after the middle of .August, and assisted in the plane-table work . .Atlantic City is included within the limits of this suryey, and also the town of Ahsecom. Tlw general statistics of the work are as follows : Coast-line...... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9 miles.

Freserration nf primary statfons.-The inspection of station marks of the primary triangulation, and the adoption of such means as were found to be necessary for their preservation, have been continued by .Assistant John Farley. During the past season he has Yisited fifteen points, and these, with the number examined in 1868, complete the entire series in this section, extending from the western end of the base-line on Long Island, across New Jersey and Delaware Bay, t-0 station Back, in the State of Delaware. Mr. Farley reports that every precaution was taken that the circumstances of $.he ground would admit to insure the identification of the points hereafter, by numerous measurements, ranges, and references, and by full descriptions, vertical and horizontal projections, and finally by illustratiYe sketches appended to his concluding report. Survey of Rondout, New York.-Having completed the survey of the lower part of Rondout Creek, and of the adjacent shores of Hudson River, in November, 1868, Assistant F. H. Gerdes proceeded to draw and ink the two large topographical sheets which resulted from his work in the

field. The surve;r is represented on an ample scale, and will suffice for any improvement projected for the navigation between Xew York Cit;r and Rondout. In the spring of the present year Mr. Gerdes plotted and drew a hydrographic sheet to represent soundings whicll he had made·in the previous autumn in New York Harbor; and after making determinations on the ground, made sketclles of tile new quarantine isfands and buildings on .the west banks, in lower New York Bay. His subsequent service will be referred to under the head of Section III.
Tida.l obseruations.-The series of tidal observations in New York Harbor has been continued as usual, by Mr. R. T. Bassett, with the self-registering gauge on Governor's Island, and with the box-gauge at the dock of the Hamilton Avenue ferry, in Brooklyn. In a few years more this series will be sufficiently extended for general discussion. Already it has furnished data for use in the construction of many important and costly works, botll public and priYate, in the harbor and its connected waters. The records have also a special bearing on the investigation of the changes which are going on in New York Harbor, or which may be caused by removing the impediments to navigation at Hell Gate.

Azimuth at Staton Station, Washington, D. C.-The obsenations to determine the direction of the lines of triangulation near "\Vashington City were made by Assistant C. 0. Boutelle with the tbirt~·-inch theodolite, between the !)th of December and the 7th of J anuaQ·. Azimuth observations were made upon iJ Ursm J\Iinoris at its western elongation, aud upon PolariR at different times between three hotus after culmination, and the western elongation of that star. Angular measurements were made between the Atar, observed alternately direct, and also as reflected in mercury and the reference mark. The local time was obtained from the N;rn1l Observatory through the courtc".Y of Commodore n. F. Sands, the superintendent, and Professor Simon Newcomb, lTuitecl StateR Navy. Assistant Boutelle prefers the obsen·ations on Polaris at the times referred to, as most likely to giYe accurate results, for the rem;on that gTeater precision in pointing can be attained when the Rtar is moving in azimuth sufficiently fast to make its own contact with the cross hairs visible, after they haYe been brought near to it hy the tangent screw. For the azimuth GlO ohserva.tions were recordf'.d of the stars and reference mark. The determination was transforrecl to the north meridian mark heretofore used in all the longitude obscrrntions, and to Hill Station, the only triangulation point now Yisible from Seaton, by 210 mea~nrements of horizontal angles. The resulting values of the angle between the meridian mark and Ilill, as measured in 18.JO and in lSG!l, agreed within a quantity equal to about three-tenths of au inch at the 1fo;tance of two miles, at which the meridian mark was situated from the observer. As the streets in that part of the city in which Seaton station is may soon be graded, Mr. Boutelle took the precaution to mark the point permanently by a copver bolt set in the brick foundation of the transit piers, and b.r other means detailed in his report. The entire work was reduced and the computations, together with the records, original and duplicate, were turned in at the office before the close of January. Prima.ry tr·iangiilation.-Assistant Boutelle returned from duty on the coast of South Carolina in the latter part of May, and immediately resumed.field-work on the primary triangulation near "Vashington City. Additional stations were selected, and signals were erected at Maryland Heights, Bull Run Mountain, and Mount l\larshall, near Front Royal, Virginia. These points command views over the valley of the Shenandoah and would serve for determining positions on the ranges of mountains west of it, though selected mainly with reference to geodetic connection with points eastward of the valley. Their determination will furnish data for local surveys of this quarter much more accurate than any that now exist. . In July Mr. Boutelle resumed the measurement of horizontal angles at Stabler Station, in

THE UNITED ST.A.TES CO.A.ST SURVEY.

25

Montgomery County, Maryland. The season was made very unfavorable by the drought which prevailed throughout the Middle States during the summer. Heat radiated from the ground caused a constant disturbance of the air through which the lines of sight passed, and thus the dis· taut signals could not be observed as satisfactorily within the period usual for occupying a primary station. As at station Hill, which was occupied last season, the thirty-inch theodolite was mounted at Stabler npou a tripod fifty-five feet high. Obserrntions were, however, complewd at that station in the latter part of August, the records showing six hundred and sixty-eight measurements of horizontal angles upon eleven stations, and one hundred and fifty-three measurements of vertical angles upon ten stations. Before closing work at Stabler, Assistant Boutelle determined in the usual way the magnetic declination and intensity. In September the party was transferred to Peach Grove Station, in Fairfax County, Yirginia, where an observing tripod was erected forty-fi\Te feet high. Observations wel'e contiuued at such favorable inter\Tals as occurred in September, but in the following month the weather became exceedingly inclement before the intended measurements could be completed at that station, I personally inspected the operations of this party iu the field. The obstacles which tend to limit the Rcope of a work so laborious in its details, and which for that reason should be made to command as much ground as possible, have been met with great judgment in the reconnaissance by Assistant Boutelle. Long lines of sight have been obtained by elevating the theodolite at three points for the determination of distant positions; resort to that expedient will not be required in extending the tri'ftingulation to the southward. .M:r. James T. Boutelle served as temporary aid in the triangulation party. Magnetic observations at Was1tingt01i, D. C.-The series of monthls observations commenced in January, 1867, and continued for two years and a half without interruption, was undertaken with a view of determining with special accuracy the secular change of the magne.tic declination, dip, and intensity. Assistant Charles A. Schott made the observations on three cousecutiye days at the middle of each month, at the Coast Survey magnetic station on Capitol Hill. 'rbe dcdinometer used was of the form devised by Lamont, supplied with Yery small magnets. The dip cirde had two position needles, and each was used in three positions of the axle. J\fr. Schott determined the instrumental constants with great care, and the measure and application of the earth's induction was here for the first time introduced in the Coast SurYey practice of observing. The method employed is fully explained in the report of Assistant Schott, which is given in the Appendix, No. 9. Coefficients for the deflection were determined from obserTations extending over one year, and the values were corrected for the effect of induction. The paper in the Appendix contains an abstract of the monthly values found for the declina tion, the dip, and the horizontal intensity between the beginning of the year 18G7 and the month of June in 1869, and the annual change of each of the elements. The epochs of eastern and western magnetic elongation are given for the declination. The effect of the secular change l\fr. Schott finds to be an annual increase of nearly three minutes in western declination ; an annual decrease of four minutes and three-quarters in the dip; and an annual increase of nearly four thousandths of the horizonal force. His report notices specially the secular variation, which changed a few years ago from annual decrease of the horizontal intensity to an annual increase, and the change of an opposite character in the dip. The paper concludes with a valuable tran· script of all known or accessible magnetic measurements made in the District of Columbia, the earliest dating back to the year 1792. The yearly changes having been deduced from the series of monthly observations, it is proposed to make, hereafter, annual determinations of the magnetic conditions at the Coast Survey station on Capitol Hill. Under the head of Section VIII notice will be made of special observations conducted by Assistant Schott on the occasion of the total eclipse of the sun which occurred in August of the present year.
BMe-Une near Craney Island, Virginia.-The primary triangulation along the sea-board of this section having been completed, it was deemed advisable to close and verify it by the measurement of a base a.t the foot of the Chesapeake. Assistant Richard D. Cutts, who had alreadr pushed the work southward of Cape Henry, as will be detailed hereafter, was accordingly joined by Assistant H. Ex. Doc. 206-4

26

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDE}l""f OF

R. E. Halter, for the purpose of making a thorough reconnaissance of the shores in the vicinity of the entrance to the bay. In conformity with his instructions Mr. Halter commenced a careful examination on the 20th of .July, and traversed the bay shores from Back River light-house to Fortress Monroe ; then Smith's Islanu, on which Cape Charles light-house is situated; also the region between Tanner's Creek and Sewall's Point, and finally the river shore from Craney Island westward. After a critical comparison of foe advantages and disadvantages of each locality, Assistant Cutts selected the site last mentioned. The position was the most favorable one for measurement; it could be readily connected with the maiu triangulation of Chesapeake Bay, and, as it overlook~ Hampton Roads and the channel t-0 Norfolk, the site is conveniently situated for any further surveys whieh may hereafter become necessary in that important quarter. The party was organized for acti·e duty on the 19th of August. After the detail of Sub-Assistants Ferguson and Perkins, Assistant Halter proceeded t.o open, clear, and grade the line, and to make the preliminary measurement with an iron wire sixty meters iu length. The final measurement was begun on the 20th of September, with the contact slide apparatus, and was finished at the end of that month. According t-0 the preliminary computation of )fr. Halter, this base-line is 5,136.6 meters in length. Its emls are on firm and secure ground, and were marked by blocks of granite resting on brick foundations laid in hydraulic cement, and also by irou screw-piles. After the measurement the apparatus was sent to the office for the usual re-comparison of the rods with the standard six-meter bar No. 2. At the end of October Assistaut Ilalter had made good progress in the mea,surement of horizontal angles according to tlie scheme laid out for connecting the base with the primary triangulation. The operations of the party were iu~pected by Assistant Cutts. ~l\ssistant Halter had been previously engaged in duty in Section V. He is now making arrangements for commencing the bydrographic survey of the James River in this section.

Hydrography of the Chesapeake est11ctries.-The large cbart of Chesapeake Bay, issued several years since, contained the sounding of the body of the bay and all the information needed for general naYigation, and for entering the priucipal rivers and branches of the bay. The lesser branches then left outstanding have siuce been uefined, anu in my report of last ~-ear mcution was made of' the work of this kind done on the estuaries of the lower part of the bay. In continuation of this service the party of Assistant J. W. Donn rt>mained in the field from the 1st of No·ember, 1868, until the end of June of the present ;year. Before sounding Piankatank River and ::\Iilford Haven, M:r. Donn traced the shore-lines with a plane-table. Several estuaries near Urbana, on the Rappahannock, were then surveyed, and the more extensiYe branches of the lower part of the Potomac Riwr, as also the Chesapeake estuaries between those rivers. In like manner all the branches of the Patapsco Hiver were sounded, and the results will be added to the chart already published. Assistant Donn was aided in the hydrographic work by Mr. C. P. Dillaway. The tides were obserYed as usual t-0 make the soundings conformable to those which appear on the engraved sheets of the bay. A synopsis of statistics is thus given in the report for the season: 157k miles.

Progress Sketch No. 6 shows the work added this year to the survey on the Chesa,peake by the two parties detailed for service. Assistant Donn has boon directed to resume w<>rk in this section on the sea-coast above Cape Charles. The party of Sub-Assistant W. W. Harding, with the schooner Hassler, was employed during the greater part of the working season on the eastern side of Chesapeake Bay. Ou the 15th of and the hyclrograpby of that vicinity was completed by the 13th of January. Work in the imDecember, 1868, soundings were eommenced iu the Little AnnemesseJ: :River, (see Sketch No. 6,) Illildiate vicinity, on the eastern shore of Virginia, was taken up in a few days after, and was closed

on the 12th of April. The party then sounded in the vicinity of Smith's Island, Fox Island, and Tangier Island, and completed work in that quarter hy the end of May. Beginning on the 8th of June, 1\Ir. Harding and his aid, Mr. A. F. Pearl, run the shore-line of Por,omoke River, and sounded out that branch of Chesapeake Bay by the 8th of ,July. The topography and hydrography of the estuaries of the Chesapeake immediately north of Cape Charles were completed by the party in the Hassler between the end of July and the beginning of October. In these various patches of work, eighty-five signals were erected by the h~·drographic party. The work <lone essentially completes the chart of Chesapeake Bay, which, as before stated, waR first issued without representing the numerous small branches that indent its shores.

II. Gerdes made a small triangulation in the vicinity of Fort 1\IcIIenry, and determined the position occnpietl hy the flag, staff of that work. Earlj· in August lie took up the verification of the position of the liglit-lwuses and buoys that are marked ou the charts of the Chesapeake and its tributaries. This serrice was completed by the middle of Notember, and has included all parts of the bay from Hi1vrc ck Grace to Xorfolk and Uherrystone. Sailing marks in Bush Ri>er were reviewed, and those in the Severn, in West River, South Hiver, the Patuxent, the Potomac to a distance of fifty miles from its entrance, the Rappahannock to a distance of fort~--fh-e mile>;, York Hfrer for forty miles, and Hampton Roads; on the eastern side of the bay, Chester Hiver, East Ba~-, Choptank River, Tangier and Pocomoke Sounds, and the smaller inlets between them and Cape Charles. The positions of new light-houses, not yet on the charts, were ascertained and plotted. All buoys now marked on the maps were determined in their present places, and tlie differences were noted for corresponding alterations on the engraved charts. The positions of new buoys were found hy observa· tions with the theodolite, and have been recorded for future chart publications. In the aggregate, more than a hundred points were determined by angular measurements in the course of the season. The concluding report, by Assistant Gerdes, with recommendations of the changes suggested by his research with regard to the lights and buoys of the Chesapeake, as a system of aids for navi· gation, has been transmitted for the information of the Light-house Board. Mr. C. P. Dillaway aided Mr. Gerdes in the field, and in bringing up the large amount of office work resulting from his observations.

Tidal observations.-At Old Point Comfort, Virginia, the series of observations with a self. registeri11g tide-gauge, which has been conti11ue<l for some years, is still in the care of l\fr. E. F. Krebs, whose labors have been ver.r satisfactory. This is one of our longest series, and will soon be fit for discussions relating to the effects of the attraction of the heavenly bodies on the waters of the earth. Many short series have been made at points on the Chesapeake and in its estuaries, the hyclrography of which has recently been completed.

Base-line on Back Bay, Virginia.-In my report for last year mention was made of the preparations for measuring a line t;o connect the triangulation of Chesapeake Bay with the main series stretohing to the northward from the base-line on Bodies Island, 011 the coattt of North Carolina. At the same time a scheme of triangulation had been laid out to extend to the southward of the new base. During the month of April the six-meter rods of the base apparatus were compared with the standard at the office, the trestles were put in order, and all the other needful prelimina· ries were completed for performing the work laid out in the preceding scheme.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

On the 4th of May Assistant Richard D. Cutts, accompanied by Sub-Assistants C. Ferguson and F. w·. Perkius, reaehed the ocean beach below Cape Henry, where the direct measurement of the coast mentioned in my report for 1867 was discontinued. The terminus of the nine-mile line was found in the condition in which it was left on closing work in that year. Commencing at that point, a base made up of two lines slightly differing in direction, and extending from Deep Ditch to Little Island, (Sketch No. 7,) was laid off along the ocean beach. The division into two parts was rendered necessary by changes in the high-water line, and to avoid wrecks and sand-knolls. After the alignment of the courses, and their preliminary measurement with a sixty-meter iron wire, the final measurement began on the 15th, and, though interrupted by storms and high tides, was completed on the 25th of 1\fay. Nine hundred and ninety-two bar measurements were made, giving an aggregate length for the two lines of 5,953.02 meters. The computed length of a straight line, which would join the ends of the base, is 5,952.6 meters. In this, as in tbe measurements made in 1867, the rods were compared with the standard at Wasl1ington, both before and after they were used in the field, and the mean of the two comparisons wa:s adopted as the leugth of the respective rods.

Triangulation of the coast of -Virginia below Cape Henry.-On the 31st of May Assistant Cutts, having completed the work mentioned under the head immediately preceding, commenced the measurement of horizontal angles at North Base, (Sketch No. 7,) and by the 7th of July effected a complete junction with the triangulation of Currituck Sound, upon the line joining Ragged Island and :~forth Point, one of the lines of the old triangulation. Upon comparing the results obtained respectively from the Chesapeake triangulation ~nd the base on Bodies Island in :~forth Carolina, hy separate schemes and methods, the differences were found to be so slight as to render it unnecessary to push the verification further to the southward, as originally intended. The statistics of this triangulation are given in the following synopsis: 10 Signals erected ..... _........ _. _. _. _. _....... _.. _. _. _....... _. _. . . . . . . . . .

The triangulation having been satisfactorily completed the party was discharged, and Assistant Cutts returned to Washington and made suitable arrangements for observing the solar eclipse of the 7th of August, mention of which will be made under a separate head. Sub-Assistant Ferguson was soon after assigned to duty in Section III, as was also Sub-Assistant Perkins, upon his return from duty with the astronomical party at Bristol, Tennessee. The originals and duplicate records of observations, descriptions of stations, and plan of the triangulation made this season on the coast of Virginia have been deposited at the office in Washington.

Azimuths at Knott's Island, Virginia.-To complete and close the operations just described it was necessary that the astronomical azimuth of the line of junction should be observed, and this duty was assigned to Assistant A. T. Mosman. In accordance with instructions, immediately after closing work under the direction of Assistant Cutts at Bristol, in this section, Mr. Mosman proceeded to Norfolk, accompanied by Sub- .Assistant Perkins, and thence to the station on Knott's Island, in the northern part of Currituck Sound, in Virginia, which was reached on the 13th of August. Assistant Cutts having previously made pre.parations for occupying the station, the observations for time and azimuth were commenced immediately, and were completed to his satisfa{ltion in two days. The azimuth was determineu by ninety measures of the angle between Polaris, near its eastern elongation, and the mark, and the time by seventy-two double altitudes of the sun. The mark in this case was one of the signals erected and used in the main triangulation. On the 21st of August the party returned to Norfolk arnl was diieharged. Until further orders for the field Mr. Mosman was employed in making the requisite computations of his astronomical work, and Mr. Perkins joined the party of Assistant Halter for duty, which has been noticed under the head of Section III.

Master Robert Platt t-0ok up hydrographic duty t-0 the northward of Cape Hatteras, on the coast of North Carolina. Early in .August Sub-Assistant Gershom Bradford, with a light-uraught schooner which was chartered for the purpose, went up the coast from Hatteras Inlet aml set and determined the signals to be used in running the lines of soundings needed in the vicinity of the Wimble Shoals. Of these .Acting Master Platt reports: "On and around ihe shoals the bottom is very uneven, varying 8tuldenly from eight to ten fathoms, and from four to five fathoms. The least water found on the shoals is three and a half fathoms, at two places. Soundings were made very close, and will show at a glance the whole character of the Wimble Shoals. Xo vessel drawing more than eighteen feet should pass in less than eleven fathoms of water, either around the Vt'imble or around Hatteras Shoals." In reference to the currents on this part of the .Atlantic coast it is observed in the same report: "The currents on the coast of North Carolina north of Hatteras are governed by the wind, and are very strong, making heavy rips, which have every appearance of shoals to those who are not familiar with them. Sometimes the current begins t-0 run quite strong twenty-four hours in advance of the wind at the same place. In our experience the storm, which was sure t-0. come, always set in from the direction in which the current had started." Loggerhead Inlet, once an opening from the Atlantic into the waters of Pamplico Sound, was found by the party to be now closed. Only two inlets at present exist on the coast of North Carolina, north of Hatteras. These are New Inlet, with four feet of water at low tide, and Oregon Inlet, with the capacity (five feet) found in the survey of 1862.

Adamson was attached to the party as aid. At the end of October the steamer Bibb proceeded to Norfolk to refit for service at the western end of the Florida Reef. While on duty near Bodies Island, on the coast of North Carolina, as many as fifteen wrecks were in view at the same time from the deck of the survesing steamer. In allusion to the character of the coast there Mr. Platt says: "The land is so low at Bodies Island that it cannot be seen in the afternoon more than two miles off shore, while Roanoke Island, which is back of Bodies Island, is in plain sight, and readily deceives the unacquainted." Sketch No. 7 shows the site of work referred to in this notice. Triangulation of Pamplico Sound, North Oarolina.-The triangulation of Pamplico Sound has been continued by .Assistant G . .A. Fairfield, and in the progress of that work special attention has been given to the connection of the base near Newbern, with coast stations in the vicinity of Ocracoke Inlet. In consequence of storms which delayed the passage of the schooner Dana from Portland, the party was unable t-0 commence operations in this section until the 11th of February. After the determination of points between Bay River and Pamplico River, required for the topographical party of Assistant Dorr, who was to be engaged on the western shore of the sound, l\fr. Fairfield erected signals at Swan Quarter, Judith, and Bay R.iver stations, (Sketch ~o. 7,) and from the last mentioned he determined additional points for continuing the plane-t.able survey. From this time forward until the 10th of July, the progress of the triangulation was interrupted and much delayed by smoke, violent squalls, and continuous high winds. Nearly all of the most important signals were blown down, and much time was consumed in their re-erection. By the 19th of August the principal stations had been occupied, and the observations were at that date so far :finished as to effect the desired junction with the previous work of triangulation that passes along the coast near Ocracoke Inlet. The party continued in the field until the end of .August.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Eleven points were determined in position by the measurement of horizonal angles. Three of the stations so ascertained were the light-houses, one on the northwest point of Royal Shoal, that on the southwest point of the same shoal, and the light-house on Harbor Island. Sub-Assistant F. W. Perkins was attached to the triangulation party until the 1st of May, when he was detailed for duty in the party of Assistant Cutts. From the 1st of May Mr.·T. Hergesheirner served as aid until the close of the season. The following extract from the report made by Captain (now Colonel) T. J. Cram, United States Engineer Corps, who was engaged in the reconnaissance for the triangulation of Pamplico Sound at the outbreak of the recent war, explains the difficulties to be encountered. in that region. Every feature of land and water and character of weather opposed to rapid progress seem to be concentrated in Pamplico Sound: "To the local difficulties cited by Major Prince, as consisting in the unrelieved curvature of the earth, the soft,ness of the marshes, the way of living, and the weather, I must add the remoteness of settlements from the stations to be occupied, which renders it impossible to obtain help, food, wawr, or pilotage for an emergency; the want of sufficient depth of water to enable the vessel to approach near to the stations, and the want of firm ground on which to encamp while occupying the stations. These natural difficulties are enhanced by many inconYeniences, among which are the daily, not to say hourly, liability of the vessel having to weigh anchor and beat away, in order to avoid being driven on shore." After turning in the records and duplicate. journals of the triangulation Assistant Fairfield reorganized his party, and is now ready to resume fielcl-work in this section. Topography of Bay Rfrer and Jones's Bay, (Pampl-ico Sound, North Carolfoa.)-In continuation of his survey of the banks of the Neuse River, .A.ssistant F. W. Dorr resumed plane-table work at Swan Island (Sketch No. 7) in the middle of January, having previously organizeu a party at Newbern to work with the old steamer Hetzel, which was used as a hulk for transportation. On the 20th of May the vessel -was again laid up. The interval of time was employed in the topographical survey of the branches of Pamplico Sound that lie between the Neuse and Pamlpico rivers. Mr. Dorr thus refers to tlle character of these estuaries: "Bay River is upward of fifteen miles long and two miles wide at the mouth, from both points of which dangerous shoals extend at least two miles into the sound. At ten miles from the entrance the river has a breadth of half a mile, and has a good beating ehannel, which gradually decreases in depth from three fathoms t-O eleven feet. But the empt~ing of Trent River and Chapel Creek reduces tlrn depth to eight and a half feet in the bight known as Mason's Bay. This is the shoalest part of Bay River. Any vessel that can cross the Swash at Hatteras can be carried to the town of ,Jackson, and can lie alongside the wharf there. "The second sheet takes up the shore-line to the northward of the mouth of Bay River, and after delineating Jones's Bay, carries the western shore of Pamplico Sound to the mouth of Pamplico River, including l\Iiddle Bay, Big Porpoise Bay, !Jittle Porpoise Bay, and l\Iouse Harbor, and the Marsh Islands, off-shore west of the Pamplico River channel. "Jones's Bay is upward of a mile wide at the month, gradually decreasing in width to a point about five miles from the entrance. For two-thirds of this distanee there is a good beating channel, varying in depth from two and a half fathoms at the entranc~ to eight or ni.ne feet off the mouth of Ditch Creek. "From the month of Jones's Bay northward to Pamplico Point, on which there is a small light-house, all the shore is marsh, intersected by bays and bights. From Mouse Harbor a canal about half a. mile in length has been cut through the marsh into Oyster Creek, a branch of Pamplico River; but this cut is available only for small boats. "An immenee shoal exwnds from the mouth of Pamplico River on the one side and the northern point of Joncs's Bayon the other, and in its stretch of fifteen miles em.braces Brant Island and its vicinity." Mr. Joseph Ilergesheimer served with this party as aid from the opening of the season until the middle of May, when he was transferred w the party of Assistant Fairfield. Sub-Assistant H. W. Bache joined Mr. Dorr's party early in February, and continued with it until the close of the working season. The following are statistics of the plane-table survey:

Hydrog1·ayhy 'of Pamplico Sound, North Carolina.-Between Pamplico Point light-house and the moutll of Neuse River the hydrography of Pamplico Sound has been prosecuted by Assista.nt F. F. Nes with a party in the schooner Arago, attended by a small steam launch. Some boat work is yet needed for the final completion of the chart of the lower part of the sound, hut as far as now done the h;nlrography includes the sailing courses aud soundings between Hatteras and Ocracoke Inlets respectively, aud the port of Newbern 011 the Neuse Rh·er; and also the sailing course for vessels pa,;sing from Neuse River into Pamplico lUYer, as will be seen by reference to the progress sketch, No. 7. Tile ,;ounclings made by JI.fr. Nes include the main approach to Neuse River, and the branches of the sound known as Bay Hi Yer, Jones's Bay, and l\Ionse Harbor. ""Work was commenced on the 18th of December and closed for the season on the2d of June. Assistant Nes was subsequent,ly employed in Section II. For the alljnstment of soundings made in the Yicinity of Neuse River entrance the tides were obserrnd throughout the working season. The general statistics are as follows : Miles run in sounding .............................................. . 890 Angles obser,·ed ................................................... . 4,269 Number of soundings ............................................... . 56,373 Area sounded, (square miles) ........................................ . 151
Assistant Nes was aided in duty in this section by Messrs. L.B. Wright and G. L. Schaeffer, jr. The party is now preparing to resume work for the winter and ensuing spring. The mainmast of the schooner Amgo being much decayed, it became unserviceable after a heaYy squall in April. In order to continue work Assistant Nes purchased from the owners the mast of a new schooner that had been wrecked out~ide of Ocracoke Inlet, ·and had it fitted to the Arago at Newbern. Solar eclipse of August 7, at Bristol, Tenncssee.-The most easterly station at which it was deemed adYisable to observe this important eclipse was situated in the mountain region of southwestern Virginia and Tennessee. Assistant Richard D. Cutts, inspector of secondary triangulation, was charged with the duty of making the precision observations there. His party, including Assistant A. T. Mosman and Sub-Assistant F. W. Perkins, left Wasbiugton on the 24th of Jul,y, and without delay reached Bristol, Tennessee, with the requisite instruments. The geographical position of that place, according to the most reliable map, was in close vicinity to the central line of the eclipse. Preliminary observations, made soon after the arrival of the party, satisfied .Assistant Cutts that the position waa sufficiently near for the object in view. Bristol is ou the line of the Virginia aud Tennessee Railroad, and immediately on the boundary, as at present recoguiz.ed, between the States of Virginia and Tennessee. A temporary observatory was erected on a hill 1,760 feet above the sea, on the north side of the State boundary, and on the 28th of July the zenith telescope and transit were mounted on their respective piers . .Assistant Mosman determined the latitude of the station by twelve pairs of stars, with a probable error of d:0."15; and the longitude by transmitting time signals to the Naval Observatory at Washington on the nights of the 29th and 31st of July, and on that of August 7, one of the wires of the Western Union Telegraph Company having been kindly placed at the disposal of the party of Mr. Cutts. The time was obtained with trant1it No. 7 on eight nightB, by the transits of 74 stars; and the latit,ude by zenith telescope No. 2 on three nights, the number of separate results being thirty-three. The value of the micrometer screw of the zenith instl'wnent was determined by 80 observati<>Ds on Polaris at its eastern elongation.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

On the afternoon of the 7th of August the weather was clear and the atmosphere unusually transparent. The times of the four contacts were carefully observed by Assistant Cutts, as also, of the immersions and emersions of each one in the four groups of spots on the sun. The protu· berances or solar clouds which appeared during totality, and two long pencil-like rays where the sun disappeared, were noted, and their position angles from the vertex. and north point of the sun, were plotted with as much precision as the means at the disposal of the party would permit. The eclipse at Bristol was strictly regular throughout its different phases, being, as Mr. Cutts remarks, unusually free from the phenomena caused by atmospheric irregularities. At the last contact, however, when the sun was close to the horizon, the limb of the sun at that point presented the phe· nomena known as "Baily's Beads." In his report Assistant Cutts makes acknowledgment of the valuable assistance accorded to his operations by Commodore B. F. Sands, Superintendent of the Naval Observatory, and by Pro· fessor Yarnall, in the determination of the difference of longitude between Bristol and Washing· ton. The eclipse station being close to the State line, was connected with one of the boundary marks by a base line and small triangulation. Two points were established by observation on the present recognized boundary between the States of Virginia and Tennessee, and the latitude and longitude were carefully determined at each point. At these two points monmnents will be placed by the citizens of Bristol and Goodson for future use and reference. The detailed report of Assistant Cutts is given in the Appe~dix No. 8, in which will also be found the reports of assistants who observed the eclipse in Kentucky, Illinois, Iowa, and Alaska.

ATLANTIC COAST AND SEA WATER CHANNELS OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, INCLUDING SOUNDS, HARBORS, A...~D RIVERS. (SKETCH No. B.)

Hydrography of Charleston Bar, South Carolina.-With special reference to the requirements of tlie light-house service, an examination has been made of the channels leading to Charleston Ilarbor, the object being to determine proper sites for the range lights, and other marks needed in nayig·ation. This duty was commenced by Assistant R. E. Halter on the 28th of January, and occupied his party in the steamer Endeavor until the latter part of the following month. The service was concluded by a minute report from Mr. Halter, giving reasons for the selection of certain isites for range lights for passing safely through the main ship channel, and sites for marks needful in the safe navigation of the other channels. In general reference to the results of his examination Assistant Halter reports: "My survey shows slight changes since the survey by Assistant Boutelle, in 1866, except over the southern part of the bar, which is now deeper, and tends more to the eastward." More water was found over the south channel coming in than has been hitherto reported. Mr. Halter recommended range lights for that channel, and suggested the removal of the outer light-vessel and the buoys to positions in range with the lights of the main ship channel. Sailing directions based on the proposed changes were given in the report, and minute descriptions of the sites recommended for the consideration of the Light-house Board. These notes and others for readily identifying the marks set by Mr. Balter on Morris Island, and a chart indicating their exact positions, were transmitted for the information of the board early in March. Assistant Halter was aided by Messrs. G. W. Bissell and W. I. Vinal. The party was subsequently engaged in similar duty at St. Andrew's Sound and at Fernandina, and also in general field-work of which notice has been taken under previous heads. Primary triangulation between Port Royal, &uth Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia.-This work is about to be resumed by Assistant 0. 0. Boutelle. The stations are selected, and under favorable circumstances the observations needful for the geodetic connection of the astronomical station at Savannah with the primary triangulation to the northward will be made in the course of the coming winter and spring. During the present year the operations of Assistant Boutelle were confined to the opening of lines and examination of the ground to be occupied. The triangulation in this seetfon is yet in advance of the t.opography and hydrography. Hence, in order t.o afford more scope to those branches of the work, the expense of completing the primary triangulation south-

wa.rd to Savannah River has been deferred. The connection will be perfected in the ensuing season if practicable. Under Section III mention has been made of the occupation of the party of Mr. Boutelle· during the summer and autumn of this year. Topography of the Romerly Marsl1es, Georgia.-A party in charge of Assistant Charles Hosmer, detailed for duty in this section, occupied the working time between the opening of the year and the 6th of :February in a plane-table survey of the shores of 'Vilmington River, contiguous to Skiddaway Island, and in defining and mapping the watercourSl'S that intersect the Romerly Marshes. Sub-Assistant H. G. Ogden was attached to the party, and two plane-tables were employed in the work. The statistics are combined with those of a more extended survey made b,'I· the same party, notice of which will be made presentiy under a separate head. Topography between Ossabazc Sound and Sapelo Sound, Georgia.-The coast topography previously clone between the two sounds just named extended inland to a distance sufficient for the completion of general charts, but did not include in all its course the important feature known as the Inland Passage, by which vessels may be passed in a route parallel with the coast, from sound to sound, and quite across the marine border of the State of Georgia, without any outside na>igation. This important passage has now been mapped and nearly completed in soundings, from the Savannah River to the upper waters of St. Andrew's Sound. Additions to the plane-ta!Jle survey were made this year by Assistant Hosmer and Sub-Assistant Ogden with a part,r in the schooner G. M. Bache, after the completion of a local surwy on the south siue of the Sa;-anuah Itiver, of which mention has been already made. Near the middle of February ~Ir. Ogden started work with a-plane-table 011 the western side of the" Florida Passage," and by the end of :.\!arch mapped the ground which borders that side of the passage between the Ogeechee l~irnr and Medway l{i;-er, taking in the vieinit~- of Snnlmry, at the head of St. Catharine's Sound. In this quarter his surrn,y compri,,;ed twenty-six sqnare miles. Assistant Hosmer meanwhile prosecuted the smw,y hetween the ::\fotlwa~· and the upper part of Sapelo Sound, including the intenening parts of Xorth :Xewport and South St>wport Rivers, the courses of which are shown on the Progress Sketch Xo. 8. The ground represented by the upper sheet is nearly all :firm land, but marsh mostly prevails between the Medway and Sapelo Sound. On the 1st of April the party was discharged, the vessel being unserviceable for continuing the work.

Assistant Hosmer passed the working season at the north in active duty in Sections I and II. Sub-Assistant Ogden was employed during that period in the same sections. The first is now ready to resume duty in Section V, and Mr. Ogden has lleen assigned to sen"ice in the na.-al expedition for exploring the Isthmus of Darien. Topography of .Altamaha Sound, Georgia.-This survey, made hy Assistant W. H. DenuiR, with a party in the schooner Caswell, completes the plane-table work of the coast of Georgia north of St. Simon's Sound. South of it no entrance remains unsurveyed, and early provision will be made for tracing and sounding the water passages that lead behind Cumberland Island in courses southward to Fernandina Harbor. Mr. Dennis took the· field on the 15th of December, and closed work on the 15th of ~fay. His survey (Sketch No. 8.) takes in the whole of Altamaha Sound, and all the contiguous waters between Darien River on the north and St. Simon's Soand. Of these intervening passages the principal ones are Buttermilk Sound, Hampton River, South Altamaha River, Mackay's River, and Back River, on which the topography of this year joins in the immediate vicinity of Brunswick, with plane-table work done previous to the year 1861, hy Assistant Longfellow. In reference to the·Charaeter of the trfangulation which was the basis for his survey Mr. Dennis says : "The tiWngulation is admirably adapted to the requirements of the topographer, and although

it is ten years since the stations were occupied no difficulty was experienced in re-establishing the points for plane-table work." Mr. 0. H. Tittmaun served as aid during the season, and accompanied Mr. Dennis for duty, which has been stated under Section I. The survey of the winter includes the city of Darien, aud the topographical sheets distinguish the lands at present cultivated for the growth of rice and cotton. With the exception of creeks and rivers about Wolf Island and the eastern part of Hampton River, adjacent to the entrance of Altamaha Sound, Mr. Dennis found the waters fresh during the winter season, and the banks of the streams covered with a growth of reed or wild cane, often ten or twelve feet high. On all sides the work here noticed joins with surveys of former seasons. The statistics are as follows: Shore-line surveyed ................................................ . 238 miles.

TopograJJhy of St. Simon's Island, Georgia,,-This detailed survey was made in .March, April, and May by the party of Assistant C. T. Iardella, with the schooner Bailey. After conferring with Atisistant Dennis, who was at work to the northward of St. Simon's, Mr. Iardella began on the north side of Hampton River, (Sketch No. 8,) and made a plane-table survey of the lower part of Little St. Simon's Island. There a junction was made of the work of the separate parties. Long Island was then surveyed in detail, and the outside shore-line was extended southward to the lower end of St. Simon's Island, including also the shores of the inland passages and marshes. Of Village Creek, which bounds Long Island on the west, Mr. Iardella reports:" It is wide, with a depth of six to eight fathoms of water, and is navigable for large vessels from the entrance at Hampton River up to Wyley's Village." Of St. Simon's Island, which also was surveyed in detail, he says: "East and west it is bounded with marsh, which is overflowed at high spring tides. St. Simon's abounds in various kinds of wood, pine and live oak predominating." The south branch of the Altamaha River is included within the plane-table limits of this season's work. In that vicinity Mr. Iar<mlla joined with the topography done previous to the war by Assistant Longfellow, and completed the survey of St. Simon's Island by tracing the shores of Frederica River. Mr~Engene Elliott served as aid in tbe topographical party. The statistics of work done are as follows:

Fernandina Bar range-lights.-Before engaging in the work at Charleston Bar, noticed under a preceeding head, Assistant Halter, with his party in the steamer Endeavor, ran lines of soundings across the bar of St. Mary's River, in the vicinity of Fernandina, Florida, for the purpose of re-establishing beacon range-lights. This duty was performed between the 8th and :l4th of January. Two positions for lights were selected at the north end of Amelia Island, and were carefully marked for the uses of the Light-house Board.

Hydrography of the Florida Reef.-The hydrographic party of Acting Master Robert Platt resumed service in the vicinity of the reef on the 7th of January, with the steamer Bibb. The work laid out for the season was the completion of lines of soundings extending from the reef to the trough of the Gulf stream, and the further development of the submarine rocky terrace or plateau, examined in former years, in the region between Sand Key and Tennessee reef. Lines radiating from the group of the Tortugas, and others off the Rebecca Channel, the quicksands, and off the Marquesas, were sounded out; and later in the season similar lines to the eastward of Tennessee reef, and nearly to Cape Florida, were run at distances of about ten miles apart. Assistant L. F. PourtaJes, who accompanied the party dru-ing the whole season, made dredgings at every sounding station, and in the'aggregate procured a large collection of deep-sea forms of life, a great many of which are new to science. A considerable number of his specimens have been identified with species inhabiting the deep-sea bottom on the coasts of northern Europe where they have probably been transplanted by the Gulf stream. In prosecuting the general hydrography it was noticed that the currents along the Florida reef :were remarkably changeable. Referring to them Acting Master Platt says: " Some days the current was running at the rate of 2.8 miles per hour, but on other days only 0.6 of a mile the hour. The set of the current was to the northward and eastward, except at one position, thirteen miles off Sand Key light-house, the current at that positioa running S.SW. three-tenths of a mile per hour." In sounding on a line between Carysfort light and Orange Key, one of the Bahamas, the current running eastward was observed to have a width of about thirty miles. "After passing through this current we came suddenly into water free of current, and in the remaining distance (about thirty miles) to the Bahamas the ship made her course good." The steamer left Orange Key on the 2d of April to return to Carysfort light, the wind then blowing very fresh from the south. As before, no current was experienced in steaming twenty miles westward, and then the eastward current was met, having a rate of three miles per hour. On the 24th of February Professor Agassiz was received on board of tbe steamer Bibb at Havana. The vessel was for two months following employed in sounding and dredging, first along the coast of Cuba and across St. Nicholas Channel to the Double-headed Shot Keys, and across the Gulf stream towards the reef; afterwards in the neighborhood of Carysfort light, and in the vicinity of the reefs to the eastward of it. The weather was very unfavorable during this part of the season, b_p.t, though little could be accomplished in the way of deep-sea dredging, large collections were made of specimens and of facts bearing on the formation of the reef and keys corroborating and completing the observations previously made by that eminent naturalist. When

the professo1Js observations were closed, he was taken in the steamer Bibb as far as Cedar Keys, visiting on the way Charlotte Ilarbor and Egmout Key. The steamer returned to Norfolk, Virginia, on the 9th of June, and after refitting was emplo;yed iu b.rdrographic duty, "llhich has been mentioned under the head of Section IV. Sub-Assistant Gersl1om Bradford was attached to the hydrographic party, and 1\Ir. J. B. Adamson serHd as aid. Among tlle incidents attending the cruise of the Bibb was the rescue of the captain and crew of tlte scl10ouer .Americus which had gone on the La.Yender Rocks, about three miles east of Key Sal. Tlle vessel was got off, but foundered at au anchorage under the lee of Key Sal, to which she had been towed by the steamer. Relief was rernlered also to the British ship Golconda in towing that vessel off a dangerous slwal in the harbor of Key ""est, where she bad grounded on the top of a spring tide. Efturtio made, at the request of the American underwriters' agent at Key West, in behalf' of the capsized brig Omaha were unsuccessful, the vessel grounding fast while in tow of' the steamer. In tlle course of the St'ason tlte currents were observed by the hydrographic party at fifteen stations, and dPpths were determined by about seven hundred soundings. The site of the operations is shown on Sketch No. D. An interesting pnper, comprising the obscrrntions made on the reef by Professor Agassiz, is given in the Appendix.No. 10.

Triangulatfon and Topography of St. Andrew's Ba:y, Florida.-The work in this section, consisting of triangulation and topography, has been regularly continued from the points WMre the parties left off at the close of the last season. Of the two parties engaged, one was employed at St. Andrew's Bay, and the other to the westward of Pedlsacola en.trance. The party of .Assistant S. 0. l'IIcCorkle reached its site of work with the schooner Torrey early in December, 1868. At the entrance to St. Joseph's Bay (north) the triangulation was resumed, and was extended to the northward and westward along the coast of Florida, in a series of quadrilaterals that embrace the waters of St. Andrew's Bay, In 1855, a partial survey uf the bay wa.s made, for the immediate benefit of commerce, in advance of the regular work then in progress. Many of the stations of the old survey ha,-e been destroyed, and others have washed away during violent gales. It may, therefore, be impracticable to compare outlines given by the old and by the recent tria.ngulation, except so far as the topographical ~beets may avail for the purpose. Mr. Mccorkle reports that the inlets at tlle eastern enJ of St. Andrew's Souncl and western end of Hurricane Island ,(Sket.ch No. 10) have closed, and that many changes have taken place in the shore-line of .St· .Andrew's Bay. Sub-Assistant H. 1\I. De Wees was attached to the party of Assistant 'McCol"kle, lilld .under his direction made a plane-table survey of the coast of Florida between St. Joseph's B&y a-nd St. Andrew's Point, joining on with the topographical survey of 1855. The shore-line Hi a level, hard beach, Yarying in width between fifteen and forty meters, and backed by a sand ridge from six to twenty feet high. The country is wooded, the growth being chiefly pine, with here ana ·there an oak, cspress, or palmetto tree. Mr. De Wees also refers to the changes, ~specially of skore-line, which have occurred since the first survey. A narrow strip of sand bas been formed, Mnnecting St. Andrew's Point and Crooked Island, making the latter a pol'tion of t-0.e main land. The pen· insula formerly known as" Little East Pass" has been completely obliterated. On the ht of June the party was discbarg~Al. The records and computations we1'e soon after forwarded to the office, and the plane-table sheets were inked and turned in withrmt delay. The following statistics show the progress of the party:

During the summer and autumn of the present year, Assistant l\foCorkle and Sub-Assistant De Wees were employed in Section I. Gulf Coast Measutement.-The geodetic connection of the triangulations on :Mobile Bay and on Pensacola Bay has been completed by tile direct linear measurement of a distance of ten miles. This operation included the measurement of angles requisite for carrying forward the directions, and also the observations for azimuth at West Gulf sllore station, tile point of junction witll the lines brougllt westward from Pensacola. Assistant J. G. Oltmanns was occupied in this service from the 26th of December until the 1st of ~larch of the present year. With a view to greater dispatch, the linear measurement was made according to a plan suggested by Assistant J. E. Hilgard, with a steel tape or ribbon, tweh-e meters in length, one of those manufactured under the patent of Mr. H. W. Paine. It is a ribbon of steel, about one-sixth of an inch wide, and of the thickness and temper of a watch-spring. The tape was well adapted to the purpose to which it was applied on the Gulf coast, being easily handled, not liable to twist or to take permanent bends, and it could readils be extended to its entire length. Assistant Oltmanns thus describes the mode of measurement: "In order to ascertain with great precision the effective length of the steel tape, as used iu the actual measurement, I first measured with the contact-slide apparatus a distance of 264 meters, and afterward the same distance twice with the steel tape. I also carefulls laid off tweh·e meters with the same apparatus, and compared the steel tape with that length, due note being taken of temperature. The length of the steel tape at 32° Fahrenheit was thus found: ''By first measurement............... . .............................. 12.0073 ''By second measurement .............. - · · · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _. . . . . . . . . . 12.007 4 "By third measurement ................................................ 12.0078 "l1ean .......................................................... 12.0015 "In making the measurements of the lines along the coast, four tripod stands were used, each having a piece of soft wood fastened on its top. One of the tripods was set np over the point of commencement, in the vertical of which a pin was inserted on top of the stand. Each succeeding sta.ncl was set up as nearly as practicable at a distance of twelve mete.rs from the preceding one. Two men carried the tape, the rear one being careful to hold the mark denoting the zero point on the tape, exactly on the pin bead, without at all disturbing the trestle. At this end the tape extended about ten inches beyond the zero point, in order to give ample space for the hand of tile operator back of the tripod head. The forward man then drew the tape taut, and when the rPar man called 'all right,' I marked the twelve-meter spot by slightly driving a very fine steel pin into the exact place, to mark the beginning of the second length, and so on. While the two men held the tape in position, I attended to the alignment, and to the inclination which is read oft' by a simple level sector attached to the stand, while two other men set the next trestle or tripod stand, one laying off the proper distance with a string, keeping the general line over the ground, an<l the other fixing the trestle. A very exact and rapid measurement was thus made." The apparatus used by Assistant Oltmanns is represented in Sketch No.-, accompanying this report. ~ixteen thousand eight hundred meters, or about ten and a half miles, were measured in this way, at an average rate of one length of tape per minute, or one mile in eight hours. For the reetitlcation of the line, and its varying directions, twenty-seven angles were measu:recl at nineteen points in .the line of ~<:iurement, by 850 single observations. Fifteen sets of azimuth measures were made at the point of junction "West Gulf Shore" with Transit No. 10, by observations of Polaris, referred to a mark by means of the azimuth screw, in the mode described by

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDEJST OF

Assistant Hilgard in Appendix No. 27 of the annual report for 1856. The several results show a good accordance, and the observed azimuth of the terminal line agrees with that brought forward from Fort Morgan, within a second of arc, checking the work in a satisfactory manner. Mr. Oltmanns acknowledges the assistance, kindly rendered, by Captain Spencer, of the revenue steamer Delaware, in transporting his party from Mobile to the field of operations, and in returning after the close of the season. In passing from West Gulf shore-station to Fort Morgan, Mr. Oltmanns lost, by the sinking of a boat, some valuable papers and clothing of his own, but rescued the instruments and records without damage. At Fort Pickens he measured some angles additional to those connected with previous work, and examined, with reference to their preservavation, the stations on the beach between that point and Perdido Entrance. Assistant Oltmanns is now engaged with a party in topographical and hydrographic service in the vicinity of Cape Sable, on the Florida peninsula. Solar eclipse of August 1, at Shelbyville, Kentucky.-Arrangements were made in the latttir part of June for observing the total eclipse of the sun at several stations in the State of Kentucky. Assistant George W. Dean was directed to organize an astronomical party that might co-operate with a party conducted by Professor Joseph Winlock, director of Harvard Observatory, by whom ample preparation had been made for observing the special phenomena of the eclipse. Shelbyville, although a few miles north of the central line of the shadow to be projected by the moon, was in other respects a fayorable position for the intended observations. Moreover, the large equatorial belonging to the college at Shelbyville, and several rooms in the building, were placed by the board of trustees at the service of Professor Winlock for the special use of the parties on the occasion. By the middle of July, Assistant Dean had his equipment of instruments in place in a temporary observatory. Between the 24th of that month and the 3d of Angnst, Sub-Assistant F. Blake, jr., made a series of latitude determinations with the zenith telescope, C. S. No. 6, recording 164 observations in observing upon fourteen pairs of stars. The micrometer divisions were ascertained from forty observations upon Polaris near eastern elongation. All being in readiness, and the weather being highly favorable, on the 7th of August Mr. Dean and Mr. Blake succeeded in recording the times of the four contacts during the eclipse, and they also observed, very satisfactorily, the occultation of six of the solar spots. These instants were all recorded on the chronograph register. The instrument used by Mr. Dean was an achromatic refractor, formerly used as a "finder" on the large equatorial at Harvard Observatory. It has a focal length of 46 inches; aperture, 3 inches; the amplifying power used was 30; and it was equatorially mounted. In referring to the remarkable phases of the eclipse, Mr. Dean mentions that he saw within fifteen minutes after the commencement of the total phase, ten faint objects pass across the moon in a southwesterly direction. These were first pointed out by Professor Winlock, and, in his opinion, were meteors. The same phenomena were observed by Mr. Blake, and by Messrs. Alvan G. Clark and George D. Clark, members of the party of Professor Winlock. Mr. Blake observed with the comet-seeker belonging to Harvard Observatory, and noted the last three contacts of the moon and the occu1tations of five solar spots. Professor C. B. Seymour, of Louisville, had the use of a small telescope belonging to the Coast Survey, and with it made such observations as he found practicable during the progress of the eclipse. At the request of Professor Winlock, bis party was attended by Mr. J. A. Whipple, an experienced photographer of Boston, with all the appliances needful for taking photographic pietures of the phenomena that might be successively presented. For this interesting and important branch of operations, Mr. George D. Clark, of Oambridge, gave his services as an assistant to Mr. Whipple. The photographic apparatus was used in connection with the small equatorial telescope of Harvard College Observatory, provided with an excellent clock movement. The aperture of the instrument is five and a. half inches, and its focal length .seven and a half feet. Eighty good "negative" pictures were made by Mr. Whipple during the progress of the eclipse, of which three were taken during the total phase, the instants in all cases being recorded on a chronograph register. Prints subsequently made from the negative representing the corona., plainly show ita symmetrical

arrangement about the axis of rotation of the sun, and its relation to the axis was at once recognized by Professor Winlock, the corona being flattened at the poles and enlargetl at the sun's equator, as was also indicated in the photographs made at Springfield, Illinois, under my immediate direction. Many other particulars of great interest will be found in the comprehensive report made by Professor Winlock to the authorities of Cambridge observatory. The details observed at my request were such as would connect with the observations of precision. His researches with the spectroscope, independent of those just referred to, will doubtless be of great value. In that branch of research and in the observation of physical phenomena generally, Mr. Charles S. Peirce, of the Coast Survey, co-operat:ed at Bardstown, Kentucky, and was assisted by Professor N. S. Shaler, of the School of Mining, Harvard College. Professor J. Lawrence Smith also observed with the spectroscope at Bardstown. The station at Shelbyville was in the southwestern 1iart of the grounds belonging to Shelbyville College. Several rooms in the college were placed at the disposal of the observing parties by the board of trustees. Assistant Dean expresses his acknowledgments for the aid also rendered by the Rev. Dr. Waller, Dr. Baker, Colonel William \Vinlock, Colonel M. 0. Taylor, Joseph W. Davis, esq., and R. O. Tevis, esq. The gentleman last named volunteered bis services for recording the temperature, readings of the barometer, &c., and made records at intervals of fifteen minut:es during the eclipse. Sub-Assistant F. H. Agnew, of the Coast Survey, had charge of the chronograph registers and obtained excellent records of the instants at which observations were made with the instruments of the observing party. Unfortunately his eyesight had been so much impaired by severe duty in the longitude party at Salt Lake City during the previous winter, as to make it impracticable to observe with a separate instrument. Falmouth and Oakland, in the State of Kentucky, were regarded as favorable points for observing the eclipse just within the limits of the shadow. The requisit(I arrangements were made at Falmouth by Mr. Arthur Searle, of Harvard Observatorj', and he was fortunate iu securing the co-operation of several gentlemen of intelligence at that place. The chief object was to determine the duration, more or less, of the total phase. Mr. Searle's observations, by an accident, were not well recorded on the Morse-Fillet register, but he reports that Captain W. E. Arnold, who was assisted by Messrs. Johnson, Yelton, and Woodson, determined the duration of totality to be fort~- five seconds at Falmouth. Judge Hu clwall and Mr. R. W. Grant observed from the hill just north of Falmouth Station, and from their observations :the time of the total phase was forty-one and a half seconds. At Catawba, a few miles north of Falmouth, Mr. D. Crozier, jr., determined the duration of totality to be twelve seconds. All these subsidiary stations were marked by Mr. Searle, for determining, when connected with stations near the south limit, the breadth of the shadow projected by the moon. At Oakland the observations were conducted by Professor S. P. Langley, director of the observatory at .Allegheny, in Pennsylvania. He was assisted by Graham Wilder, esq., and Mr. N DeBree, of Louisville. The observations gave for the duration of totality only two seconds. The stations at Falmouth and Oakland were connected by telegraph, and clock signals were. sent from Oakland to all the telegraph stations in the vicinity, and thus many of the operators were enabled to determine the duration of totality with a fair degree of precision. Assistant Dean in his official report acknowledges his obligations to John Van Horn, esq., general superintendent of the Western Union Telegraph Company, and also to Messrs. Carter and Boyle, telegraph managers at Louisville, for fucilities of great value to the success of the operations in Kentucky. The preceding occupation of Mr. Dean will be referred to under the bead of Section X. His report on the observations ma.de by the party under his direction at Shelbyville is given at length in the Appendix, No. 8.

GULF COAST AND BAYS OF ALABAMA, AND THE SOUNDS OF MISSISSIPPI AND OF LOUISIANA TO VERMILION BAY, INCLUDING THE PORTS AND RIVERS. (SKETCH No. 11.)

Solar eclipse of August 7, at Springfield, nlinois.-The party organized to observe under my immediate direction the phenomena of the total solar eclipse was placed in the general charge of Assistant Charles A. Schott, chief of the computing division of the Coast Survey Office. Assistant L. F. Pourtales, an experienced observer, was also of the party, and with him were associated Professor James M. Peirce, of Harvard College, and Messrs. E. P. Seaver, R. A. McLeod, J.B. ·warner, C. N. Fay, and W. P. Montagne, of the same institution. A most important adjunct in photographic apparatus was provided by Mr. J. W. Black, of Boston, who also accompanied the party with his assistant, ~Ir. Richard Fitzgerald. This branch of service was strengthened by the addition of Messrs. Sexton and German, photographers, of Springfield, whose aid proved to be of great value. The duty assigned to the party was to obtain measures of precision of the contacts, and to make such collateral observations of the phenomena of the eclipse as the instrumental outfit would allow. As will be mentioned elsewhere, the astronomical latitude and longitude of a station in Springfield bad been previously determined by the party of Assistant Goodfellow. That determination was transferred by Assistant Schott geodetically to a station suitable for the intended observations, in the grounds adjoining the water-works, about a mqe and a quarter northeast of the city. In effecting the transfer, a base line was measured, and also the azimuth, and the requisite angles of a small triangulation. Incidental to this, the positions of several prominent objects in the vicinity of Springfield were geodetically determined. The local time was obtained from transits with the Trougbton & Simms transit instrument C. S. No. 4; the Krille astronomical clock; and the chronograph (Bond) C. S. No. 2. The local battery used consisted of three Daniell cups, and was kindly lent for the service of the party, from tlie \Yestern Union telegraph office at Springfield. The clock corrections were deduced with special care by Messrs. Schott and Pourtales from observations made on the 3d, 4th, and 7th of August, previous to the eclipse. On the 5th and 6th it was cloudy and at times raining, but on the 7th the sky was clear; no cloud was seen; and the atmosphere was free of dust. Time signals were sent on the 6th and 7th to Assistant J.E. Hilgard for the use of his party stationed to observe the eclipse at Des Moines in Iowa. At Springfield, transits of solar spots were observed and noted on several days before and at'ter the eclipse, according to Oarrington's method, but neither of the telescopes available for the party being provided with clock movement, such observations were secured at a disadvantage. Photographic 11ictures during the eclipse were made in the principal focus of the OQject glass of the equatorial telescope 0. S. No. 1, and corresponding to the focal length of the instrument they are about two-thirds of an inch in diameter. The equatorial was so adjusted that by merely turning the handle for effecting motion in right ascension, the images could be kept quite near to the middle of the field during the eclipse. In photographing, the light at the object glass was restricted to an aperture of only about two inches in diameter. The pictures were taken instantaneously. As tlie drop slide passed transversely through the axis of the telescope, the galvanic circuit was broken automatically for about one-tenth of a secondi and thus for each picture the time was reoorded on the chronograph. At intervals of about nine seoonds during the eclipse Mr. Black took one hundred and seventy-eight sharply defined pictures of the sun and moon in conjunction. Though small in diameter, the negatives are of such general excellence and were so precisely timed, that they may be expected to give, by careful measures under the microscope, results for the times of contact that will considerably exceed in value such observations when made by the eye. The pictures were timed by Assistant Pourtales. Mr. Black attended at the instrument in person, as photographic operator. Independent observations were ma.de by Assistant Schott with the zenith telescope 0. S. No. 5, and a. magnifying power of about 65, a red shade glass being fastened to the inverting eye piece. Mr. Seaver used the small equatorial from which the sun's image was thrown on a white screen

Among other interesting particulars in that comprehensive report, it is noticed tha_t the phenome11a known as Baily's beads were seen by several of the party; and l\fr. Schott, iu observing the occultation of the largest spot on the strn, noticed the formation of a black band of junction between the moon's advancing limb and the umbra of the spot. {l'he Appendix referred to is a careful synopsis of the observations made by the several memberA of the party at Springfield and of the results deduced from them. · Preceding the time of the eclipse, ProfeAsor J.M. Peirce and ::Ur. ·warner were deta.clted from the party and sent to Bloomington, Illinois, to obscn'e the phenomena .at a station on the computed line of two minutes duration of totality. This dut,y was successfully performed and valuable results were obtained. Latitudes and wngitudes in Illinois, Iowa, and Kebraska.-The geographical positions of ·points selected as stations for observing the solar eclip'so of .August were determinell by .Asilistant Edward Goodfellow, nided by l\fr. E. I'. Austin. The use of the Western Union telegraph lines having been liberally granted by General Anson Stager aud General J. J. S. ·wilsou, of Chic.ago, and arrangelllents made with the superintenclent~ of the western railroads, who readily gave free transportation for observers and inslrumc!lts, Mr. .A ustiu was sent successiYely to Mattoon and Springfield in Illinois, and to Enrliugton aucl Des l\ioines in Iowa. Asi,;istant Goodfellow remained at Omaha, the longitude of which he had deter· mined by the telegraphic method in connection with observers at Cambridge and San Prancisco. Mention will be made of this service iu the next section. On the 27th of A.prii, and on the nights of the 2d and 3d of May, signals were successfully exchanged between Mattoon and Omaha. Mr. .Austin, after completing observations for the latitude of Mattoon, proceeded to Springfield. There the work was much delayed by unusually wet and stormy weather, so that observations for latitude were not finished until the 6th of June. Signals for longitude, however, were obtained on the 22d of ::\fay and on the 2d and 4th of Jtme. Burlington was occupied during seven days in June, signals being exchanged between the observers ou the 17th, .21st, a.rid 22d of that month. Similar observations were made at Des Moines on the nights of the 8th, 9th, and 10th of .Tuly. .At each of the. stations the position of the center of the transit was permanently marked by a block of stone with a copper bolt, and meridian lines were established by placing a second block, similarly marked, due north or south of the main station. Descriptions of these markings frr identifying the stations readily are inserted in the record-books. Duplicates of the records of observations for latitude and difference of longitll(le have 1leeu received from Assistant Goodfellow and deposited in the Office-. At the request of General Robert R. Living·ston, surveyor general of the distrtct of Iowa and Nebraska, Mr. Goodfellow e.xchanged signals for difference of lougitucle with 0. N. Chaffee, esq., who was engaged in running the western boundaries of the State of Nebraska. Two stations in the State, namely,. Bushnell and Julesburg, were thus determined in longitude. The field-report mentions the acknowledgments due to General C. C. .Augur, commauding· the Department of the Platte, who lent military tents for the use of Mr. Austin's party. ~Iessrs. W. B. Hibbard, district superintendent of the Western Union Telegraph lines, and Frank Lehman, o.ffice manager at Omaha, also gave prompt and courteous ~din furthering the telegraphic work. · The correct geographical positions of the 1~ints occupied by .Assistant Goodfellow and Mr . .Austin. are stated in the Appendix, No. 8. · A.t the request of Major Blickensderfer, the Government commissioner, siguals for determining the longitude of North Pfatte, a station in Nebraska., and of Hawlings, in Wyoming Territory, on the line. of·the Union Pacific Railroad, were 'exchanged between that offioor and :Mr. Austin, while the latter was at Omaha.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

by the commissioner, who soon left for Washington, aJll]. the results were computed in accordance with his request. Bolar eclipse of August 7 at ])es .iJfoines in Iowa.-The party under the direction of A~sistaut J.E. Hilgard was equipped with the means of making the observations of the contacts of the sun and moon, and noting the attendant phenomena. Assistant Edward Goodfellow, }fr.·T. H. Lmw, of Washington City, aml Dr. T. C. Hilgard, of St. Louis, accompanied as observers. Lord Sackville A. Cecil, of England, having applied for permis;;iion to join, was associated with the imrty. As at the other station on the path of the eclipse east of tbe Uocky l\Iountains, the sky was perfectly clear, and a very satisfactory view of the phenomena was obtained. The instants of the several contacts were noted by Assistants Hilgard and Goodfellow; those of only the external contacts by l\fr. Lane, whose attention at the time of totality was directed to other phenomena. During that phase Dr. Ililgard made drawings of most of the protuberances which showed on the edge of the sun, and especially delineated in full detail the remarkable one on the lower edge. A full report of the results will be found in the Appendix, No. 8. The observing station at Des 1Ioines was in the court-house square. Its geogrnphical position, as mentioned in the preceding notice of work in this section, had been determined under the direction of Assistant Goodfellow. A transit-instrument was mounted for observations of local time, which were obtained on the afternoon of the eclipse. The chronometers used were compared by telegraph with the clock used by the observing party at Springfield in Illinois. Assistant Hilgard, availing himself of the opportunity, made observations for determining the magnetic elements at Des Moines, and thus procured additional data for the chart of magnetic lines, the last edition of which was published in the Annual Ueport of 1865. These determinations by an observer of great experience are of special value, the station being far removed from those upon which the traced lines on the chart have hitherto depended. Assistant Hilgard organized, in addition, two parties for the determination of the limit of totality north and south of the line along which the total eclipse was also central. One of the parties was directed to the southern limit near St. Louis in Missouri, the other to Cedar Falls in Iowa. At both stations satisfactory observations were obtained, from which the limits may be inferred with great precision. Near St. Louis the arrangements were kindly undertaken by Major J. Pitzmann, county engineer, who, aided by l\Iessrs. Eimbeck, McMath, Soldan, Cobb, McKown, Bnrgas, and Schmidt, occupied five positions arranged across the path of the shadow at distances one mile apart, and observed the duration of totality, which, at the station nearest to the limit, was only ten seconds. The geogmphical positions of these points have since been det.ermined by Mr. 0. H. Tittman and Professor William Eimbeck, who observed for latitude and longitude at the \Vashingtou University in St. Louis, and connected the eclipse stations by a survey. The observations at Cedar Falls were arranged by Dr. A. Horr, of Dubuque, and were made by :Messrs. E.W. Horr and \V. J. Anderson, of Dubuque, and J. H. Stanley, of Cedar Falls, at three different points, the geographical positions of which were afterward determined by Sub. Assistant F. Blake. The practical sagacity of Assistant Hilgard led him to improve the opportunit~· afforded by his operations for giving data by which to increase the value of local maps of the region adjacent to his stations. Both at St. Louis and Cedar Falls the astronomical stations were connected with the public-land surveys b:r ascertaining their position relative to the nearest section corner. The stations will thus serve to assign correct places on the map to certain portions of those surveys, which, however adequate· to their immediate purpose of parceling out the land for sale, afford only imperfect means of making a map of the country. Through the assistance of Dr. Horr the l~tions of two other points on the northern border of the eclipse were also ascertained, at which the total obscuration lasted but a moment, while at a short distance the light was obscured but did not entirely disappear. Due weight will be given to these observations as to the others in the general discussion of restilts. Triangulation and topography of Isle au Breton "Sound, Louisiana.-The party of Assistant C. · H. Boyd was organized for this service early in January, and before the close of that month commenced work with the schooner James Hall. The signals used in the triangulation were tripods of sixteen and twenty feet in height, with cast-iron heads of a form devised by Assistant Boyd. When

olJserYing, the theodolite rests upon the h!lad of the tripod, the iron at other times supporting merely the signal-pole. .By this expedient horizontal anglel'I were measured above the level of the mangroves and reeds that fring·e the shores of the sound. The greatest elevation attainable wa8 required to bring into view at Point au Sable the signals set on Isle an Breton. Sketch No. 11 shows the work done in two chains of triangles extending from the limits reached by the same party in the precccling season. One of these chains passes in a northeasterly direction across Isle au Breton and Grand Gosier, toward the Chandeleurs ; the other covers the main western shore and adjacent islands, and stretches in a northerly direction a8 far a8 Point Chico. Within an aggregate length of seYenty miles in triangulation, l\Ir. Boyd and Suh-Assistant H. L . .Marindin, °\tho was attached to the pr;:i;t,y, surnyed 312 miles of shore-line with the plane· talJle. The topography is 011 fiye sheets, and was accomplished under much liardship, arising a;;; well from unfaYorallle weather as from natural obstacles to progress on this part of tbe Gulf coast. As iucideutal to the work of the sea8on, Assistant Boyd selected and marked a suitable site for a light-house on Grand Gosier, at a point about midway between the Chandcleurs and Pass <I Loutre. The laud ou that island is the highest and the most stalJle found' by the party in the range of work for the season.

The snn·ey is about to lJe resumed iu Isle au Breton Sound. JTydrography of Isle a1i Breton Sound, Louisiana.-The party of Assistant F. P. 'ycbbcr, with the schooner Vari1m and steam-lauuch Baratarhi, reached this site of work on the 20th of J anuar;r, and, at once set up a tide-gauge, as usual, before commencing the hydrography. The tides being irregular, observations were taken every half hour, day and night, in order to get a good determination of mean lmY water. Tile mean rise and fall of tide °\las fol!nd to he 1.1 feet. At all favorable inter>als the SOUJl(lings were prosecuted from Pass a Lontre in a north"West and north direetion to Isle au Breton and Grand Gosier, (see Sketch ~o. 11,) and the lines were crossed hy others stretching from the west sitle of the sound to the same islands. Soundings were t·xtended also from these islands toward the main shore to the northward, the distance in that direction Yarying from six to ten miles. The hydrographic sheet shows that a shoal estends from the end of Grand Gosier, in a Routhwest direction, to a distance of about twelve miles; in fact, overlapping the eastern end of Isle au Breton, and leaYing only a Yery narrow channel between the two islands. The shoal is dangerous, having in some places as little as three feet of water. It breaks in all heavy blows from the Gulf. Owing to the low level of the shores, As3ista,nt 'Vebber was nuder the necessity of erecting several scaffolds thirty feet high, as signals for the use of the boat-party in sounding. The cur· rents in the sotmd were found to be >ery strong, and all north and east winds made the water very rough. Outside from Pass a Lontre the current in all onlinary weather set strongly toward the northeast, but nearer shore the current was found to set up and down between, the islands, with the flood and ebb tide. In reference to the channels and character of the soull(l, Mr. ·web her remarks: "To the northwest of Isle au Breton tile water is slwal, and there are a great many lumps with _twelve feet water on them, or less, and there is no passage across except for lightdraught v-0ssels.'' ".From Point an Sable there is a channel with about ftaeen feet of water, making up toward the west·for a distance of six miles, and heading near the mouth of Fort Bayon. To the north and east of it there is a large shoal." The hydrographic work was continued until the middle of May, when the vessel was laid up for the season at the head of the passes in the Mississippi.

Longitude and latitude of (h1wha, Xebraska.-Tbe adYaneed progress of the surYey of the of the D'nited States has for several years made it desirable that the work on the l'acific coast should be conneded with the surveys on the Atlantic coast and on the Gulf of Mexico, h~' telegraphic longitude determinations across the continent. F:1vorable circumstances w bich presented at the opening of the prt>sent season made the deci8iou easy in regard to undertaking the work without further delay. The detailed arrangements were iutrusted t-0 .A.ssistaut George'\V. Dean, and suitable preparation iu the outfit of instruments and appliances was made by him in Hecernber, 1868, for occupying a stat.ion at Omaha, in Nebraska, and another at Salt Lake City, iu Utah Territory, as points intermediate in the transcontinental series of longitude stations between Cambridge, ~Iassachusetts, and San Francisco in California. After completing the organization of the party which was to act under his direction, Assistant Dean proceeded to Salt Lake City ~arly in ,January of the present year, leaving Assistant Eu ward Goodfellow at Omaha. 'fhe operations at Salt J,ake City will be detailed under the head of Section X. At Omaha au astronomical station was established by :Mr. G'oodfcllow in the grounds of the old State-house. The ample facilities afforded by the officers of the Western Union Telegraph Company and by managers of the railroad companies of thew·est have been mentioned in referring to the operations of this party in Section VIII. · The obsrrrntor~· having been eonnecte.d with the main wires, a preliminary trial of the line was had on the 7th of February, between Cambridge, Omaha, Salt Lake City, and San Francisco, and, the results being satisfactory, the work was carried forward until exchanges of clock-signals for diiforeiice of longitude had been obtained on six nights between Cambridge and Omaha. Operations at the first-named city have been describe(! under the head of Section I. Successful e.xchanges were made on eleven nights between Assistant Goodfellow, at Omaha, and Assistant Dean, at Salt Lake City. On six nights signals were passed between the observers at Omaha and San Francisco. Transit No. 6, spring-governor No. 2 and the Krille clock were used at Omaha in the longitude work. For the correction due to inequality of pivots of the transit-instrument, two sets of observations were made at altitudes ranging from 50 to 550. The stars observed for time anll thread intervals were taken from the American ~autical Almanac, and from a list prepared for the uo;e of the longitude party by Professor Joseph "\Vinlock, director of the Cambridge Observatory. lipon the completion of the work the point which had been occupied by the transit was permanently marked by three blocks of limestone. The upper one, a cube of fourteen inches on a side, is level with the surface of the ground, and ha-s inserted in it a copper bolt, to indicate the station point. North of this, at a distance of two. hundred and eighty-one feet, three similar blocks were placed in position, the upper one with a copper bolt in the.center, thus establishing a meridian line across the capitol grounds. The expense of procuring and setting .the blocks was borne by the city. ·

)fr, E. P. Austin, of the :Xautical Almanac Office, was temporarily attached to the part~- ot Assistant Goodfellow, and ably co-operated in the sen ice. The intensely cold and stormy wcatlH.'r, and the frozen state of the soil in January, made the work of putting up an observatory, and the ~mbsequcnt proccss<'s, matters of much hardship and exposure. For latitude, 173 observations were made 011 :J5 pairs of stars selected from the British Assodation Catalogue. The value of the micrometer-screw was determined b,y two sets of observations 011 Polaris at western elongation, and the Yalue of one division of tlle Jeyel in terms of th\' micrometer by two sets of observations upon a distant mark. Under the direction of Assistant Goodfellow, a series of meteorological olisen atioru; wen~ recorded at Omaha b_y )fr. J. \V. Barrett, who accompanied the astronomical party as a hand. Jlfagnetic obsert'ations at Omalia.-In one of the rooms of the old capitol lmilding, Assistant Goodfellow made observations for the magnetic intensity, recording two series. The declination and dip of the magnetic needle were determined at a station below the hill, selected on account of its freedom from the local attraction due to the cast-iron pillars and window-sills in tlle old capitol. Tllree sets of observations were made witll declinometcr No. 1; aud three set-; with the dipcirclc No. 8. The astronomical meridian was determined at the magnetic station in the usual way by obsen·ations on the sun. After closing service in this section, Assistant Goodfellow was on duty at two stations in Section VIII, and is now in Section I, making prepamtion to rcceiye and &tmd time-signals for llct<'rmining the difference of longitude betwcep Duxbury, l\Iassachusetts, and the eastern end of the French transatlantic cable, which is at Brest, on the coast of France. Hydrography of Corpus Chri1Jti a11d .Aransas Bay.~, 'Te.ras.-Iu prepariug for this work, Sul>Assistant Horace Anderson fitted out the schooner SteYens at Ga\yeston, and reached Corpus Christi with his party on the 15th of ,January. Two tide-gauges were establisheJ, one at Ingleside Ilarbor, and the other at the "Dug Ont," leading into ~ilransas Bay. The soundings made preYions to the end of l\fay define the character of the lower part of Aransas Bay, the shore approaches or Corpus Christi Bar, and the channel lmiding from the bay out into the Gulf of lYiexico through Corpus Christi Pass. In these several bodies of water, the maximum tfopth found was fourteen feet, gradually shoaling toward the shore. "Directly in front of the town of Uorpus Christi, and about half a mile distant, are t\rn reefs on which the depth of water is only four feet. They oycrlap each other, and the channel between them is intricate." "Between Corpus Christi Bay and Laguna l\Iadre the pass is narrow, and has only t1Yo and it half feet of water. In the 'Dug Out,' be~ween Aransas and Corpus Clnfati Bays, the depth is six fret. This passage is about four mi.lcs long, and~Yery narrow and crooked, but the tlredgingmachine in operation this season is relied uponJor deepening the channel to eight feet. ''Ou the outsitle bar of Corpus Christi Pass, the depth of 'rnter is four and a half feet, but . e\'cry gale of wind changes the channel, so that it is practicall_y useless for nayigatiou. Tlll're is, moreover, an inside bulkhead between the pass and the bay, on which the depth is but four feet." The statistics of this survey inclnde the tracing of thirty miles of shore-line, the erection of twenty-fi,·e signals, and the determination by horizontal angles of the positions of thirt~--:1ix oQjects.

Triangulation, latitude, and a.::inwth near Santa Barbara, California.-Upon his return from Alaska in August, Assistant George Davidson transferred his party to the shore of the Santa Barbara Channel for tlte determination of the latitude and azimuth of three main stations of the triangulation of that region, and for connecting it by telegraph with the work done near San Francisco. At the date of his report, ~ovember 30, he had nearly completed the observations at station Santa Barbara. The observations for latitude were made with the zenith-telescope No. 1, and embraced 300 obserrntions upon 36 pairs and triplets formed by 87 stal's, and 538 observations upon IJ Ursm l\1inoris, 51 Cephei, aud i. Ursm Minoris near elongation upon three nights for Yalue of micrometer-screw. In the determination of the chronometer correction he observed the transits of 98 stars :with the new meridian instrument of his invention, which has been described. in the Heport for 1867. This has a reticule of 9 threads with interva1s of 10\f seconds. One hundred and twent,y-. three measures had been made of the thread interrnls with the micrometer which is used for latitude observatiom1. . To determine thti azimuth of the lines of the main triangulation from the station Santa Barbara, Mr. Davidson set up a mark on the foot-hills north of the mission and about three miles from the station. Its position was determined from the line Santa Barbara-Bill. The mark is connectell with the main lines by means of the line Santa Barbara-Pelican. At the date of his report he had observed 335 measures for azimuth upon the mark aml IJ Ursre l\finoris, 51 Oephei, and l L'rs:.e l\Hnoris near elongation, and 170 measnres to connect the mark with the main lines and other objects; and 25 transits of stars to determine the chronometer correction. Vertical angles were measured to determine the e1evation of the mountain range belriml Santa Barbara, and of stations on Sauta Cruz Island. The instrument used for the azimuth work wao; the 18-inch theodolite No. 4, reading bs three micrometer microscopes. Assistant DaYidson computed the prediction of oceultations of stars by the moon, visible at the station, and observed the immersion of 31 Sagittarii with reconnoitering telescope No. 18. Incidentally he observed the number of meteors which appeared on the 14th of November. J\fr. S. R. Throckmorton, jr., serYed as aic1. The· party of Mr. DaYidson will remain in the field all winter. Magnetic observa.tions.-At station Santa Barbara 106 observations for magnetic declination were made b.Y Assistant D:widson and l\Ir. Throckmorton upon three days, and 128 observations for horizontal intensit,y upon one. day, with the theodolite magnetometer No. 5. For the dip, 144 observations were made by Mr. Tl1rockmorton with three needles in three positions of the axes. Topography of Santa. Barbara Channel.-Assistant \V. E. Greenwell has continued the topography of the main shore of the channel eastward from Santa Barbara toward San Buenaventura. When it reaches the latter place, the topographs wili be complete from Santa Barbara to Point Duma. From Santa Barbara to El Rincon the immediate coast line is settled, and the work not difficult; but thence to San Buenaventura, the mountains come abruptly to the water's edge, and reach an e1evation of two thousand two hundrecl feet in a mile and a lmlf. Their seaward faces are cut by Ycry deep gorges, and the execution of the topographs is Yery difficult. The camps are of necessity far from the scene of work, as no water fit to drink is found in a stretch of nearly twelve miles.

The greatest eleYation over which topography has been carried in this region is two thousand one hundred and fifty-eight feet. Two sheets on a scale of Toho have been finished, and a third commenced. One has been partly inked. Projections for the sheets were forwarded from the oilice. During tlle season Assistant Greenwell occupied two tertiary stations, and made the duplicatcx of horizontal angles from Mournl Station, near Santa I~arbara (see Sketch No. 3) to Point Mup:u. The abstract and computation of the sides of the same haYe been received at the Office. A full abstract of the results was also furnished to Assistant Cordell for use in tlie hydrography. Tlrn party was in the field at the date of :l\Ir. Greenwell's report, (Sov'ember 15,) engaged in extending· the tertiary triangulation eastwarcl for the topography. Mr. Stehman Forney has continued in service in the party as aid. Hydrography of the Santa Barbara l'hannel.-Upon completing the survey of the shoal off Point Reyes, mention of which will be made further on, Assistant Edward Cordell transferred his vessel and party to tlie Santa Barbara Channel. The inshore hydrograph;y of the main coast lrns been carried westward from the west limit of Commodore Alden's work, two miles east of Sau Ruena,·entura, to a point fort,y-five miles beyond, and for se,·en miles in the vicinity of Point Conception, with an average width of-two and a half miles. Tile off-shore hydrogr:aphy ba8 been carried for a distance of fifty miles, parallel with the inner work, with an avarage width of two and a quarter miles; while eight lines, comprising one hundred aml sixty miles of deep-sea soundings, have been run across the channel from Anacapa Island to tl!e west ·end of Santa Cruz Island, and off Point Conception. The one-hundred and two-hundred fathom curves are well deYeloped. The deepest sounding reached was three hundred and twelrn fathoms. Specimens of the bottom were obtained with each cast. In the prosecution of this work, the triangulation and shore-line of the main aml of the Santa Barbara Islands, where completed, was famished by Assis taint Greenwell; an<l of Point Conception by Assistant Rockwell. Assistm1t Cordell erected and determined the position of forty-nine hydrographic signals; and for the ofl'.slwre work determined the positions of conspicuous mountain tops on the main and islands. Tidal observations, day and night, were made from .July 11 to September lG, Santa Bal'bara, and from September 1G to NoYember 7, at Santa Cruz Island. The work of the season is comprised in seven sheets of in-shore llyclrogmphy ou a scale of 101J 00 ; with one sheet on a scale of rod1ITTJO for the off-shore soundings. The statistics of the channel work are : :Miles of soundings .. _......................... _.................... _.... 1, 278 Angles observed .. _..... ,_ ........... _...................

Topography at Point Gonception.-During the whiter and spring Assistant Cleveland Hockwell, after inking and tracing his maps of the preYious senson, commenced the topography at Point Cou· ception to carry it northward. Much difficulty an<l delay were experienced in effecting a landing at El Coxo at that season. In addition to the usual margin for shore topography he was instructed to make a sun·ey to embrace t1rn crest line of the Coast mountains, immediately behind Point Conception light, as seen from seaward. This was done on a scale of :nr!oo, with contours of 100 feet, and broad generalizations of topography in a rough but characteristic tegion. The· topography was based upon a tertiary triangulation made hy the party of l\Ir: Rockwell, aft;er the measurement of a base-line of one thousand five hundred meters, and embraced the following statistics : Miles of ocean shore.... . ........... _......·....................... -- . . . . · · 11 · Area, (square miles). ____ ... _._ ... _._ ..... _... __ ............................ · 9

OF

Mr. Hockwell also furnislied the data of his triangulation and tracing of his topography to Assistant Cordell for the hydrography. Sub-Assistant L. A. Sengteller was attached to the party. In May Assistant .Rockwell discharged his party iu San Francisco, and supervised the repairs upon the schooner Humboldt, while l\Ir. Sengteller inked and traced the two sheets of the winter'.work The party was subsequently engaged on the shores of the Columbia Jtiver m Section XI.. Hydrograplty of Coxo Harbor, California.-This work was prosecuted and completed in October by Assistant Cordell, with his party, in the schooner :Marcy. The soundings were carried about four miles to the eastward of Point Conception light-house (Sketch No. 13) and about half a mile to the northward and westward of it. Seveml attempts to extend the work furtber in that direction were unsuccessful on account of very strong wilJ(ls and rough seas. Rarleck Castle Roclc.-At the close of the season's work in the Santa Barbara Ohaunel, Assistant Cordell was directed to search for the unknown sunken rock upon which the Britil'lh IJark Harleck Castle was lost; ·ancl which was reported to haYe 14 feet of 'vater upon it at high water, ancl to lie three miles off shore and five miles northwest of Piedras Blancas. Ile was successful in his search and identified the rock by the nm.st of the vessel showing above water. The- rock is bare at low water,)ies inside the outer edge of the kelp-line, and in a bight of the shore between Pie<lras Inam~as and Rio Cruzo. It is nearly one mile off shore, but inside the line of the above positions, aud not in a vessel's track. Hydrograplz_lf off' the So nth Farallon.-In N overuber of last year Assistant Cordell was instructed to search for the reporteu sunken rocks about eighty miles to the southwestward of the South Farallon light. He made a projection and conducted the first search in the Coast Survey schooner 1\Iarcy in December, 1868. Subsequently Assistant Davidson had the l:"nited States revenuecntters Lincoln and Wyan<la placed at his disposal by the kindness of Geueral John F. Miller, collector of San Francjsco. The last examinations were made with every facility and advantage that could be extended by the officers in charge of the vessels. In the several examinations an area of nearly two thousand five hundred square miles was traversed, and no bottom coulll be found with soundings of one hundred to two hundred fathoms, nor any indication of shoill water. If the rocks e.xist, they must, in the opinion of Assistant Davidson, be sharp peaks. The area examined lies between latitude 3GO 30' and 370 20' and longitude 1230 33' and 1240 40'. From March 20 to June 28 Mr. Cordell attended to the repairs of the schooner Marcy, and under his direction Sub-Assistant :Farquhar made three projections on a scale of 1001 r00 , embracing 1 the coast from Point Conception to San Diego and the Santa Barbara Islands. The topography and triangulation of previous years was plotted thereon. l\fr. Farquhar also made seven projections, on a scale of 10 ~00 , for the in-shore h;plrography of the Santa Barbara Channel. Topography of San Francisco I'cnins1tla.-During the winter and spring Assistant A. F. RoJgers was engaged in inking and tracing the large sheet, exhibiting, on a scale of roko, one hundred square miles of the peninsula of San Francisco, lying between the bay and ocean. The sheet bas been received at the Office, and a tracing furnished to General B. S. Alexander, Corps of Engineers, United States Army. In this work l\Ir. Rodgers was assisted by l\Ir. E. F. Dickins, temporary aid. The details relating to the survey have been given in previous annual reports. Longitude of San F1·anc:isco, California.-To Assistant Davidson was assigned the charge of the operations on the Pacific coast for the determination of the difference of longitude by telegraph between Cambridge Observatory and San Francisco. After obtaining permission from the mayor and Bupervisors of San Francisco, he set up a temporary observatory in Washington Square, to which the Western Union Telegraph Company kindly ran a loop of one of their main lines. The season was favorable and the lines when used were found in excellent condition. ' In this work observations over the line were commenced on the 15th of February and closed on the 4th of April. Througli-signals each way were ex~hanged with Cambridge upon twelve nights, and directly with Omaha on eight nights, and with Salt Lake on twelve nights. The clock correction was determined by transits of Nautical Almanac and Cambridge Catalogue stars, by the electric method over a reticule of twenty-five threads. Observations were made upon several nights for this purpose. Toward the close of the experiments, ancl subsequent to them, Mr. Da.vidROn, assisted by the chief's of the other telegraph parties, made his experiments for determining

Unfa\'Orable. weather prewnted the excliangP of clock-signals for longitude determinations until the 7th of February, but from t!Jat date the work was carrird forward to completion on the :3d of Mareh. Operations at Cambridge, }fassachus(~tts:, connected with the work at Omaha and Salt Lake City, have been referred to in Section I. Signals were well exchanged between Salt La.Im Uit.r and Cambridge Ob.srrYatory on eight nights between the dates just mentioned. Ele,·cn nights fayorable for signalfl, employt>d the obserYers at Omalrn anu Salt Lake City. l\Ir. Dean exchanged time signals on ten nights with Aso;istant DaYidson, who was stationed at Snn Francisco; and for the relatirn longitude of Brigham City in r:tah i::ig11al8 were made and receivrd at Salt J,ake, at the request of l\fajor J. Blickensdcrfer, ci dl engineer, one of the Pacific Hailroad commissioners. In addition to the usual 11rocesses for longitude, experimental signals were passed through the entire telegraph line on se,·eral nights from Cambridge to San Francil'lco, a!ld returned through another circuit. This complex telegraph line was more than se\·en thousand miles in length, and the success of the experiments is highly creditable to the managers of the \Yestern Union Tele· graph.Company. Acknowledgments arr due for the able co-operation of the company at each of the stations· occupied for longitude. The experimental signals alluded to were made for the purpose of obtaining an approximate measurement of tlie time l'cquired for transmitting signals through a large nnmber of "teleg-raph repeaters," adjusted in circuits from four to firn hundred miles in length, and are quite different in character from experiments for the special olijrct of determining the rnlocit.r of tile galrnnic warn through different kinds of conductors. At Snlt Lake City, .Assistant Dean had iu use a bi·eak-circuit chronometer made by Charles Frodsham, esq., of London, and reports fayoral1ly in n·gard to its performance. In ascertaining the clock and instrumental corrections, Mr. Deau and Suu-.Assistant Agnew recorded three bundred and ten obserTations on seventy-three circumpolar allll zenith stars. The 46-inch transit C. S. No. 4 was used in this service. The latitude of the station .at Salt, Lake City was determined· uy l\I1'. Agnew with tlic zenith. telescope No. 6. Two hundred and forty observations were made 011 thirty-nine pairs of stars. .The micrometer diYisions were measured bv two hundred and forty ouservations Utlon Polaris near western elongation; and one hundred a~d seven readings were noted. while determining the level divisions from measurements with the micrometer. A meridiau line about a mile and a half in length was marked by Mr. Dean at Salt Lake City. The sonth end at which the transit pier was left is markrd by a copper bolt inserted in the stone. H. Ex.

About two tlwusanll feet uorU1 of tl1c station oecupiell by the astr011omical part,Y, a sawJ;;tone post was s11nk four feet into the gTomHl. In its top a copper lJolt was inserted, to indicate the continuation of the meridian line, the north end of which was marked simply by a cedar post sunk three feet in the ground. A copper uail in the top of the post ranges with the two copper bolts liefore mentioned. The gratifying success whith has atteuded the operations for co1mecting in lougitmle the snrn·_ys on the Atlantic with thor-;e ou the Pacific coast of the "United States is due in a large measure to important collateral aid; Assistant Dean makes special mention of Yaluable ser"\'ices accPpted from nenernJs Thomas T. Eekert and Ammn Stager, and from Colonel ,James Gamble, supcrintenueuts of the tt>legTaph lines. The president of the l:"nion Pacific Railroad Company, Bon. OliYel' .

JJiagnetic obsen·ations at Salt Lake City.-The magnetic «lec1ination was dc"terrnined at three stations within the Temple Square by obserYations on seyen days. Three sets of "l'flJrations arnl deflections of the magnet were made for determining the intensit;y; and three set8 with two needles were m;ide in ascertaining the magnetic dip. The obseryations were made jointly b_y l\Ir. Dean and l\Ir. Agnew. '''hen the operations at Salt Lake City, compri,;ed in the plan made at the outset of the seaso~1, were completed, Assistaut Deau proceeded to San Francisco, and there made a series of obserYations with Assii;:tant Davidson for ascertaining tht'ir personal equation as obsel'\'ers. .After l1is ]'(;turn to the Atlantic side, Mr. Deau e11gagcd in astronomical dnty in Section VIL In NoYt>mber lie irnile<l for l3rc'i-;t to detnmiue the difference of lo11gitnde between a station in that city and a station at Duxbury, on the coast of .:\Iassaclmsetts.

He visiteu tlie locality in June, accompanied hy Assistants Cordell and Rodgers, mHl reported upon a site which was jointly considered the most eligible. r.Ier:srs. Davidso11, Ho1lgers,· and Cordell have commanded Coast Suffey Ycssels for years upon this coast, aod are familiar with the requirements of the usual aids to navigation. Their report bas been communicated to the Light-House Board. Assistant Davidson is now pre1)aring a report upon tlie fogs of the I'aciflc Coast aud tlie peculiar requirements in respect of lighthouses and other aids to navigation. Shoal o:ff Point Reyes, California.-.A r-;hoal known to exist some miles to the westward of Point Ht>yes, and of which mention was made in the first etlition of the Directory for the Pacific Coast, publislied in 1858, bas been developed by Assistant Cordell. Assistant Davidson made a cast of thirty fathoms in that vicinity as early as the year 1853, in passing to San Fra'tlcisco from the northward. In the formal search attention was first drawn to the special site of the shoal by numbers of seal, sea-lions, and marine birus, which resort there. In describing the result of his soundings, l\lr. Cordell says: "The least water found was twenty-five fathoms, about one mile S. E. ~ E. from the central llOint of the shoal. The shoal is fi.ye miles long, with an average width of a mile and a quarter, within the curve of thirty fathoms; hut it is twelve miles long and five miles wide within the fifty-fathom cmve. Its longest axis is in a direction N. W. and S. E., or ne.arly"in thr prolongation of a lilw through the Farallon Islands.''

He reache1l that place in SeptemlJer, measnrell a short base, and canicd the triangulation and topography five miles northward of the prcyious \Yark. From a fair ha;;;~ in this triangulation, he determined the position and elevation of all the visible rocks and breaks of the Dragon Rocks or Crescent City Reef, amounting to eight.een. He expresses the belief that a detailed bydrograpbic survey may reveal others. The most northern rock of the reef is s1wen and a half miles from the northern part of Point St. George. Ileavy weather prevented. the occupation of any station ou these tocks, but upon one opportunity Mr. Chase went in a whale-boat and determined in position approximately the sunken rock, locally known a1:1 the "Jonatlmn Hock," a mile and a lialf west of the main body of the reef, and two miles south of the Southwest Seal l!oek.

Hyl1rogra11ny of the Columbia Rirer, Oregon.-The condensed statistics of the hydrograpby of the Columbia River, commenced in :Xovember, 1867, and closed in August, 1868, were not in.eluded in my rrport of last year. There were 2,455 miles of soundings run, 21,282 angles observed, and fH,479 soundings maue. Between tlle beginning of November, 1868, and the end of l\Iay, 18G9, Assistant Cordell plotted and inked the soundings on three hydrograpbie sheets -0f Uolmnbia BhTer from Three-Tree Point to Tuugne Point, on a scale of Tlfloo; and ou two sheets, including the bar and entrance from Cape Disappointment to Tongue Point, on a scale of 2Vboo· Duplicate tracings of this work were made for the Coast Survey Office, and for General B. S ..Alexander, United ;;tates Corps of Engineers. A comparative ehart was tben 'lrawn, showing the change in the h;ydrography of the approa~hes and entrance of the Columbia since 1854. A current-chart was also mtfde, exhibiting the positions of seventeen current-stations in the north and south channels, and in the approaches to the main channel from the entrance of the river up to Astoria. Duplicates of thirty-one souncling-books and ten tide-registers have been received at the Office. Sub-Assistant G. Farquhar and :Mr. A. P. Redding were on service in the 11ydrographic rmrty of Mr. Cordell. Reconnaissa,nce on the coast of Oregan.-Assistant Davidson has furnished '\'iews an<l descriptions of Cape Sebastian in latitude 420 18' ; Heceta Head, in latitude 44P 09' ; Cape Perpetua, in latitude 41° 19'; Cape Foul weather, in latitude 44° 52'; and the Yaquinna Pass, in latitude 440 45'; Nekas Rivei:, in latitude 4-.JP 56'; Cascade Head, in latitude 450 03'; Split Rock, in latitude 47° 23'; and Sea !Jion Rock, in latitude47o 27'.

Astronomical observations in tlze Straits of Fuca.-On his 1rny to obse1Te in Alaska tlw solar eclipse of August last, Assistant DaYidson stopped and determined the geographical position of Esquimalt and Victoria, on Yancouwr I:slancl. f\ixtecn dn·ouomett·rn ,n·n· transported to and from San Francisco. The following arc the statistics of this "ork: At Esquimalt, for time and longitude, transits of fourteen stars, one night; at Yictoria, tor time aµd longitude, transits of forty-four stars, two nights. For latitude he obser\ed difference in the zenith distances of ten pairs of stars. These observations were malfo iu order to get additional data for the discussion of station error existing at one of the astronomical stations in this Yicinity. The instrument used for time and latitude "\l:as J\Ir. Davidson'fl new meridian hrntrumcnt Xo. 1. Assistant Dayidson was aided !Jy Mr. S. H. Throckmorton. Under direction of l\fr. DaYidsou the stations at Esquimalt antl Yictoria were trigouometrically coirnected by Assistant Lawson in August and September. The latter station liad been preYiousJ~· connected with the triangulation of \Vashingfon Sound and Admiralty Inlet. Triangulation and topography of Port Discovery, lra.sltington Territory.-At the t1atc of my last annual report on the progress of work in this section, .l'>.ssistant J. S. Lawson had llis party on the brig Fauntleroy in cffecth·e condition, and daily expected to commence the survey of Port Discovery. So dense, howen~r, was the smoke, and so widely vrm·ailing in this part of \YashingtoH Territory, that a boat co111d not he safe]~- sent from the Yessel, and, if sent, could not be disti11gnished at a distance of a hundred yards. Yessel;;;, after entering· the Straits of l'nca, were at that remarkable period from twelYe to tweuty days in Teaching Port Townslternl, a distance of only uinety miles. The Yessel containing· tlte party narrowly escaped being run down by a large ship, which had been set out of her course, and which was not seen until almost aboard of the Fauntleroy. The unusual calms hy which the smoke became a permaneut olJstade were followed by continuous storlllj' weather. l\lr. Lawson in consequence closed field operations on the Hth of ::-;;owm· ber, 1868, having had but two days on which the plane-table could be worked, after the di1-mppearance of the smoke. All favorabJe hours~ however, were employed in determini.ng the positions of signals for the survey of Port Discon~ry. The vessel was then taken to Olympia, and, just previous to the discharge of the crew, was dismantled and moored for the winter. In ofiice-work :\lr. Lawson, and his ai<l, Mr. J. ,J, Gil!JGrt, iuke<l aml plotted the topographical and hydro graphic sheet" oi' tlle survey of ·Port l\Iadison, and computed results from the triangulation of I'ort Discowry. These, with similar computations for the triangulation last made hy t!Ie party in Admiralty luh·t and Puget Sound, ha ye been received at. the Oflice. , The necessity for thorough repairs on the brig FauntleroJ- delayed the organization oi' tlH· party for work during the summer, but with no loss of time available for field operatious, as a rcpt" tition of the smoky season commenced. in June all(l continued until the first he~·w,y min.fall, in tlw latter part of August. Taking· ad,·aritage of the first favorable weather for making determinations which had been postponed, the Fauntleroy was moved to Esquirnalt Harllor, in tow of the uuite'l Stai,es steamer Pensacola. There the astronomical stations, occupied by .Assistant DaYillsnu i11 Jul,y of the present season, were connected by Assistant Lawson with the triangulation of the Straits of Fuca. Mr. Diwidsou reviewed this work on his return from Alaska, and then pass<>ll 011 to San Francisco, where he subsequently recei·ed the field. computatious. After returning to Port Discovery, the plane-table surYey was continued by ::'\fr. L:rnsou arnl his party. Two topographical sheets have been completed; the first extending from Hose Signal to Fog Signal, (see Sketch No. 15,) including Protection Island and the entrance, and the other the middle part of Port Discornry.

Owing to frequent clouds, the beginning of the total phase only was successfully observed. Mr. DaYidson computed the predictions for all tl1c occultations of stars hy the moon during the expedition to .Alaska, lJut unfavorable weather preYented their observation. Ile re-computed for his station on the Chilkaht Itiver the prediction of the solar eclipse; rcclueed the Jatitnde observations made at Sitka, Kohklux, arnl Fort \Yrangel; and computed results from the magnet.ie oliservations at Kohklux.

From Sitka his party went with an open boat and a canoe through the great straits. The country was fnll of hostile and warlike Indians, but the party was treated with great kindness. General Jeff. C. DaYis, at Sitka, commanding the .Military Department of Alaska, furnished l\fr. Davidson with a hoat and extended eYery facility to aid his party. . General George H.

" The effect of the magnetic-iron ore in the soil anu in the mountain range o>erhangiug the river was to cause a local deviation of 10° from the calculated declination. Mr. Da>idson traced for twenty-fi>e miles a mountain ridge of two thousand feet in height, which he found to be composed of magnetic ore, some of wllich would yield 73 per cent. of iron. He also found iron on the shore of Chatllarn Strait. Reconnais11ances fo Alc.rander .Archipelago, Alas](a.-At Etoline Harbor, (Fort 'Vrangel,) and extending as far as Point Highfield, J\Ir. Throckmorton made; under the direction of Assistant Davidson, a reconnaLssance, with soundings, to exhibit the best anchorage. Lindenberg Co·e, iu Peril Strait, was sketched and sounded for the same purpose, and also the vicinity of the beach on which the party encamped, in latitude 58° 50', on tlle west shore of Chatham Strait. Mr. Davidson sketched several parts of the coast before leaving Alaska. His views include Etoline Harbor; Dall's Read, on the east shore of Clarence Strait; the passages leadiug to Fort Tougas, through a course of eight mileR; and the Kootzriow Rapicls, leading 'from Chatham Strait to the coal deposits on Admiralt;r Islaud, a distance of seven miles. These sketches arc now at the Office, and also a chart sent by .l\lr. DaYidson to exhibit corrections which he had been enabled to make in the best existing charts of the Alexamler Archipelago. Tidal observations.-Assititant Dayidson, before lea\·ing the coast of Alaska, in 1867, established several tidal stations. In the course of tltis year the records of partial series have been receiyed at the Office, the latest being from tlie tide-gauge at Sitka, in August and September of the present year. One of the series, continuous for nearly seven months of 1867-'68, was recorded at the station estalished by l\Ir. Da>idson at Unalaska. COAST SURVEY OFFICE. The general direction of the operations in the Office of the Coast Survey, where the surveys made by t1Je field-parties are combined into charts aml published, has remained, as heretofore, with Assistant J.E. Hilgard. The operations of tlle Office are made to keep pace with the field-work; tli<' results of each season are fully elaborated within the subsequent year, and all aecumnlation of back work is thus avoided, except so far as the completion of the suney over more extended areas affor<ls the data for comprehensive adjustments of geouetic reeults, anu for charts of a general character. The operations of the past year are briefly stated below: Computing division.-The work of this division, comprising the computation of all triangulation of observations for latitude and azimuth, as well as of magnetic observations, has been, as heretofore, under the immediate charge of Assistant 0. A. Schott, with the same force of computen; as employed during the previous year, consisting of l\Iessrs. T. W. Werner1 James J\fain 1 G. Rlllnpf, and E. Courtenay; the distribution of the different classes of work remaining unchanged. In addition to the special duties as chief of the computing division, Assistant Schott continued the monthly magnetic observations until June, when the series was concluded. His general report on this work and· the discussion of its results are giYen in.~.\ppendix No. !J. During the months of July, August, and September much of Mr. Schott's time was given to preparing the instrumental outfit for the solar-eclipse observations, in which he participated, and on which he has prepared an elaborate report, contained in Appendix No. 8. He also contributes to this volume a report (Appendix No. 6) on theadjustment of the primary triangulation on Chesapeake Bay, which is in coutinuation of formel' papers of a similar nat~\re, connecting together a continuous triangullltion from H.

The comparison of the uifferent liase-lines that have been measured at intervals in this long series of triangles, given in the report referred to, will be found of special interest, as affording the surest and most obyious test of the precision with which the survey has been conuuctell. Tidal dirision.-Thc inspection of the tidal anu meteorological observations when reeefred at the Office, the correspondence with the obseners, the supervision of the computations, and other works relating to tides and title-gauges, have been kept up by )Ir. R. S. Avery, assisted by Mr. A. Gottheil, Mr. J. Downes, and Miss M. Thomas. All data and other information respecting tides required for Office use, for obser.Yers, and for the use of field-parties, have also been furnished. The ordinary reductions of the observations, and deduction therefrom of.the general results used for charts and other purposes, have been made as soon after the obserYations were receivetl as practicable. 'rhe tide-tables, or predictions, for 1870, the fourth year of the series, have been computed in this division and are published. They contain the approximate predicted times and heights of the tides for about twenty of the most important places on our coasts, with tables of constants for finding from them the tides for a great number of other places. 'Ihcy are improved each year as the accumulation of new materials and. the C}i:tension of the discussion of them render it possible. Hyilrographic dii:faion.-The drawing and verification of hydrographic charts from the original notes of soundings a111l ang1c8, the verification of charts relluced to the scales of publication, the prfparation of sailing directions and all notes pertaining to navigation, ha ye been, as heretofore, performed in this division of the Office, under the immediate direction of Captain C. P. Patterson, inspector of llydrography, by Mr. B. Willenbiicher, assisted by l\Ir. J. Sprandel. Drawing division.-In the conduct of this branch of the Office the assistant in charge has been ably seco~1ded Uy l\Ir. W. 'I'. llrig!1t, who has had charge of the details of the division, and has materially assisted in planning the work. The drawings for engravell charts ha ye been made by l\Ir. A. Lindenkohl, chief uraughtsman, aml by l\Iessrs. II. Limknkohl, L- Karcher, and l!'. Fairfax. Traced copies of maps have been made by "\V. Fairfax and B. Hooe. Views of headlands and approaches to harbors have been taken during the year by l\Ir. Mc:\Iurtrie, and were afterward dra"\Vn by him for engraving on the charts. Copies of manuscript maps and charts, or por· tions of such, are frequently furnished, upon request, to other branches of the public service, as well as to private persons; the latter, of course, paying for the cost thereof. This is an important fonn in which the information collected by the Coast Survey becomes available to the public, and a list of the maps so furnished ·during the year is given in Appendix No. 2. A list of the maps and charts, either wholly drawn during the year, or the work on which has been continued as far as the material on hand permitted, together with the names of the persons engaged upon them, is ginm in Appendix No. 3. In addition to the work shown in that table, the following statement will serve more fully to exhi!Jit the operations of the division:

to the consideration of mecl1anieal means for cmnpleting the 11ecessar~· topngrnpliie;tl dt·tail.·:. Etching had proved so successful aud rapid a mode for engraving 'rno<ls that I deemed no e::q1l·riment in that direction necessary, but endeavored to so irnprorn the combination of tlle roulette and ruling-machine as to dispose iu a r:ipid manner of tlH' broa1l snrfac(' of grass occup~·ing t;o much time when engraved by hanu. "I found in t1rn roulette he.retofon· m;etl tltL· axis of reyo]ntion :-;lrnrt,Pr Urnn the diameter of the wheel, consequently any wear or i1lay of tl1e axis was multiplied on the surface of the wheel, tending to interrupt the parallelism of the ruled lines. I had a varidy of roulettes made with axis of revolution about three times the leng"th of the diameter of the wheel, hy which means all play in the bearings was reduced to one-thiru npon the circumference of the wheel. The ol<l roulette:-; had the ends of the axis turned to conical points, which fit into corresponding sockets in the arms of the carriage. This I reverse!l, in order to retain i1ennanent1y, as a center of revolution, the cent.er upon wlrieh the wheel was turned in the lathe, having adjustable conical strcl points in the ·carriage fittin~ the sockets in the ends of the axis. Hy this means there is preserYe<l a rc.-olutio11 of the wheel in a plane perpendicular to the axis, except so far as it may be affected by a wear of the bearings. Special earn was taken to make the teeth of the roulette as Jong as possible in order to secure deep work. The result appears in the tinting of the lantl of Xcw York Entrance, \Yuieh I have had the pleasure to lay before you. "l\Iy attention was next directed to the application of the same means to the sand tinting of the six, tweke, and eighteen feet seetions of t'he bottom. This was onlr a question of mechanical skill in the construction of the roulette, with snch modifications of the diameter for different openness of dot as readily suggested themselyes. l\Ir. Charles \'\",Black, under my direction, succcede(l in making a series of roulettes, which were m1ed for the sand of Galveston Entrance, New York Entrance, and Port of New Berne, the edges of the sectious·only being done by han<l. Thirty-six ounces weight has been used on.these roulettes without any perceptible iujur.r to them, and I am satisfied that double that weight can be used should a tint require it. "The work on the maps named was done at less than one-fifth tlle cost it would ham rcqnirr<l to do it by hand in the most inferior manner. Althongll I hope for still better results, enough has aheady been reached, I think, to congratulate onrselYcs on a considerable stritle towaru success. "The former mode of engraving buoys, by which tllc sign, name, color, and number were all engraved, required a considerable amount of work, and often, in narrow channels, interfered with imundings and other featureR important to navigation. I therefore, in the early part of the year, proposed a system of signs, by which all the characteristics of'the buoy, except the number, are at once distinctly indicated, which, with some modification in form by yourself, has been adopted. "The Light-House Establishment uses four kind of buo;ys as follows: " 1st. Red-to be left in entering on starboard ha111l. "2d. Black-to be left in entering on port hand. "3d. Black and red horizontal stripes-danger-buoy. "4th. Bla-0k and white perpendicular stripes-channel-buoy. "Our new system giYCS an open white sign for a reu lmo;y; the smnc sign in blaek for a black buoy; the open sign with a horizontal black bar for a tlanger-buoy, and the open sign with vertical black b~ for a channel-buoy. The number, being engraved below each buoy, completes the information connected with it. ''Coast Chart No. 9 (Boston Bay) was the first chart to v.hich the new system was applied, on which the buoys will be found to have a distinctness which the old system could not giYe." The force of engravers has remained the same as for several years past, viz: Lettcr-engraYer:-;, Messrs. J. Knight, E. A. Maedel, A. Petersen; topographical engr:wcrs, ,J. Euthoffcr, Il. Evans, A. Rolle, A. Sengteller, A. l\I. 1\faedel; miscellaneous eugrnveri;;, H. S. Barnard, J.C. Kondrup, R. F. Bartle, W. A. Thompson, J. G. Thompson, F. W. Denner, E. II. Sipe. The pantograph was used by Mr. E. Molkow. J'ifr. G. W. Morrison acted as writer in the <lh·ision.

CONCLUSION.
In concluding this report, I rejoice to bear testimony to the zeal and loyalty with which the officers of the survey have sustained me in carrying on the operations of the year. The just pride which the assistants manifest in the snccessfnl prosecution of the work, and their harmonious co-operation, are sure pledges of their integrity and of their fidelity to public interests. The hydrographic inspector, Captain C. P. Patterson, has not me'rely discharged the duties of his office with the skill to be expected from his abilities and experience. He has taken an intelligent interest in all the operations of the survey, and has been ready everywhere with fertile su1gestions for the good of the service.

:My acknow lcdgrnents arc gladly e:1..i:endeJ to the assistant in charge of the Office, J. E. Ililgard, esq., whose profound scientific acumen and extensive research, permit no opportunities to escape for making improvements in the executive branches of the work. The arduous duties of disbursing agent for the survey have been discharged by Samuel Hein, esq., with undeviating precision; and by Assistant W. ,V. Cooper, in the discharge of clerical duties, I have been spared from the most laborious of the details of administration. Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX No. 5.
UN THE RECLAMATION OF TIDE-LANDS AND ITS RELATION TO NA YIGATION· BY HENRY MITCHELL, CHIEF IN PHYSICAL. HYDROGRAPHY, UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.
P..1.RT !.-GENERAL DISCGSSlON OF THE SLBJECT.
Relation.~

of the Ooar;t 811rvey.-Althongh, as a general rule, marshe,s reclaimed from rivers am.I by drainage ar.e the most fertile and enduring of all soils, the cases are exceptional where enterprises in this direction are profitable prior to the period when an augmenting population has exhausted the resources of the uplands. In our own country, lands ha1e been reclaimed from time to time since the earliest settlement; but until recently efforts of this kind have been confined to high marshes borderi.ng upon rivers or sheltered bays, and in most cases for the growth of special crops. The period, however, has arrh·ed when the sea-board of our Northern States has become so densely populated that projects of ieclamation are becoming popular, and promise favorable investments for capital. The topographical sheets of our Coast Suryey, which reach the public only as printed maps, upon scales so reduced that many of the details and most of the original spirit are lost, furnish us with an amount of information relative to the extent and character of the tide-marshes along our shores scarcely appreciated by those outside of our service. These sun·eys in the manuscript, as they reach us from the plane-table, furnish not only the measures of reclaimable marshes, but exhibit the configuration of the surrounding country so boldly, and at the same time so minutely, that one can scarcely cast J,iis eyes over one of these sheets without superiuducing upon it tempting schemes of conquest. To the engineer every detail of the topography has a practical ·value, which he cannot afford to OYerlook in developing a scheme of drainage. In the reclamation of tide-lands it is- all-important, because it is the best economy, to so arrange the dikes, canals, and sluices that the largest possible area shall be included in one comprehensive plan. These enterprises arc profitable in the measure that they combine individual interests and assume the proportion of public works. In the same measure also the Coast Survey, I think, should be ready and willing to furnish information, not only through maps and printed reports, but also through its officers in person ; the topographer with his sheet before him can .be of more value in oral discussions of projects than by ·writing reports, because he cannot know in advance the means or the wants of the people. He is not at all competent to originate the project, but very well able to assist a community in doing so. In a corps like ours, composed of men selected carefully and trained to scrupulous trntllfulness in the study of nature, I should feel no anxiety with regard to the character of the a1kice that individual officers might give. They feel their reputations involved in the success of the undertakings as well as in the presen·ation of their entire freedom from private ipterests. The relations of encouragement and of assistance, which I have indicated as my notion of a proper policy for the Coast Survey, are not the only or the most important interests which we have in these opening enterprises; we should be watchful of them, because they involve eftects upon navigable channels sometimes beneficial, sometimes detrimental. We should favor legislative grants in some cases and oppose them in others. Perhaps there is no navigable stream that can be safely left to the exclusive control of the communities upon its banks. In my studies.of foreign works of reclamation, whose histories have been preserved through long periods, I scarcely find the instance where the encloisure of tide-lands in the vicinity of channels is neutral in its effects upon navigation. It seems to me, therefore, that our first thought upon tltis subject should be from a commercial point of view. To any one whose memory goes back to the time when railways were unknown, or to any one whose travels l!ave extended beyond the sound of the steam-whistle, I need hardly say that the recent improvements in land transportation have bad a tendency to diminish with·us the number Of small vessels known as "market.men," whose mission it has been to ply between the great sea. ports and the little coves and inlets of the a(ljacent coast. In the early settlement of the country it was all-important to the agriculturist to find a location in the vicinity of a navigable watertide-wat~rs

course, in order that the products of his labor might be within reach of a market; and on the other hand, very shallow streams and really dangerous harbors became, in some cases, the sites of considerable commerce, simply because they afforded the only available avenues to a productirn country.· In these modern times a change has come over the spirit of migration and trade, aml among its first fruits we find that many of the smaller streams and harbors are falling into compamtive disuse. The time is come indeeu when th-e farmer covets the rich soils that lie suumerged, auu is quite ready to entertain any project of reclamation regardless of its effect upon navigation. Were the entire value of a water-course always to be measureu by its service, as an avenue for '·market-men,'' the conversion of its territory from commercial to agricultural uses would be generally popular as soon as the bed of the stream became more valuable to the farmer than its water, and no strife woul<l occur; but in most cases there are other interests involved which are antagonistic to this change, viz : the trade in foreign or distant products, the fisheries, &c. Sometimes, too, an arm of the sea which has ceased to be of use to the residents upon itR banks, haR still a na· tional value as a harbor of refuge or as a thoroughfare. It might be supposed that a study of long-standing marine works, and the comparison of repeat~d surveys, would lead directly to generalizations relative to the effects of encroachments upon the pathways of streams. My experience, however, in such inquiries has been anything but this. The testimony, as a whole, is conflicting, and it is only by recognizing among i!treams generic and specific differences, and classifying all streams according to-them, that I have any hope of formulating the results. of my study. This hope is not yet fully realized, but I shall yenture to suggest a few of the points I have reachctl. Tidal and river currents.-W ere there no other agencies at work than the tiues, the form of channel which these would construct, in alluvial soil, would be the estuary; I use this word, because it is already understood t-0 designate a water-way whose sections increase as they near the sea. If this increase of section were simply dependent upon volume, I might have used the term oonoid, but ~cour depends directly upon the velocity of currents, an_d no symmetrical figure can represent a channel excavated by two streams, ebb and flood, which hav<C different velocities and pathways. 1st. A greater proportion of the scour of channels is execut(Jd by the ebb than by the flood, because tke former is c<>ncentrative, while the latter is dispersive. I called attention n;iany years ago· to this contrast between the modes of action of the alternate tidal drifts, and illustrated their combined effects by such instances as Delaware and Chesa11eake Bays. Tue tide-wave traYels more rapidly in deep than in shallow water, so that in.the middle of the bu.y the water is more elevated ou the rise and less elevated on the fall than along the shore; the rise is therefore attended by a current pressing shoreward, while the fall induces a run· ning in toward a central axis. The consequence is, that, although the inflowing and outflowing volumes may be equal, in a supposititious case, the ebb, concentrated, is the more rapid, and therefore plays the greater part in excavating a central channel-way to the sea. 2d. Near the outlet of a· tidal basin .the section is .greater, in pt·oportion to the passing 1,olume, during the flood than during the ebb, so that tlte latter is the rnore rapid stream, and confines its work more closely t-0 the channel-way. This finds its best illustration in the case where a sandy channel communi~ates with distant and shallow interior basins. The flood has but little filling to do until a high stage is reached, anff does not therefore acquire a high velocity. The discharge, on the contrary, of the interior basins i11 so delayed that the tide near the entrance has fallen off very much before the outflowing volume becomes cbnsiderable. In an extreme case the very volumes that pass up with the entrance channel nearly full escape to the sea again when this channel is nearly empty. 3d. River currents, because "less dense than tke sea water, are disposed to become superficial on meeting the latter, and tJwrejore ea:ecute litfl.e soour in their lvwer courses. The phenomena at the mouths of rivers emptying into tideless seas illus.trate in a striking manner this thinning out of the river over the surface of the salt-water. Hu.mphl'f!y and Abbot's _ "report on the ~iississippi River states that "the current in the Southwest Pa&a is quite equal to pushing this material along the bottom, but when the river wQter begins to ascend upon the salt water of the Gulf, the rolling material is not carried with it, but is left upon the bottom iµ the dead

angle of salt water. A deposit is thus formed whose surface is along or near the line upon which the fresh water rises on the salt water as it enters the Gulf. This Mti-0n produces the bar." Admiral Smyth found the waters of the Rhone overlying the Mediterranean three miles Leyornl the delta shore, but the depth of this fresh stratum measured only three foet. "'e cannot attribute the formation of bars exclusively to the lifting of the fresh waters of rivers upon the salt waters of the sea,, because there is a disposition in all streams to relinquish their debris wherever an enlargement of section causes a reduction in the velocit;y of the current, and this, of course, is most conspicuous· at· embouchures. The waves, in exposed situations, take also a prominent part, not only in breaking up the outflows of streams and in forcing back and heaping up their debris, but often in augmenting the supply of bar-building material by contributions from the wear of the coast. Thus bars are to be found at the months of rivers flowing into broad lakes which resemble those upon the seaboard, except that the former are less abru11t and of less elevation than the latter, other things equal. A comparison, however, of coast charts discovers that much the worst bars form where great rivers empty upon tideless seas; so that we may infer that in the meeting of waters a difference of density aggravates the case. All the streams flowing into the Mediterranean are closed to maritime commerce, and all th.e silt-bearing rivers which find their way into the Black and Caspian Seas are likewise :;;topped up. According to Sir Charles Hartley, over sixty per cent. of the waters of the Danube escape to the sea by the Killia mouths, over bars having no channels through them more than six feet deep. River-waters perform so little service as scouring forces at the sea-board, that, in man;v instances where they have been found charged with sediments, engineers have advocated their exclusion from harbors. The ItaJian engineers, particularly, concur in atfrising against the choice of a river mouth as a site for an artificial harbor. So, also, the French engineers, in planning the ship-canal of Saint Lonis, have provided for a gate to prevent the waters of the Hhonc from flowing into the terminal harbor upon the l\fediterranean. Judging from the condition of the natural outlets of the river, they believed that its water, if suffered to pass through the canal, would not only be of no service as a scouring agent, but an injury, because of the burden of mud which it would relinquis~1 upon the threshold of the port. The l\Iississippi bars remain at the same absolute elevations during floods as during low stages; and the Danube has a worse bar in the former than in the latter condition. The more effectually a river is able to exclude the sea from its basins, the more utt~rly impotent it seems to. be in its last struggle to reach the ocean. I remember to have been much impressed with the fate of a torrent which I saw rushing from the Maritime Alps toward the Mediterranean. It was a deep stream, plowing its way furiously-through the country till it reached the sea; there it received a sudden check, stumbled over its own debris, and broke up. In my report upon ''The Coast of Egypt and th'e Suez Canal;'' I called attenti~n to the fact that, with other things equal, rivers with tides have more water upon their bars than those without. The effect of a flood-current is to bring in the sea and mingle it with the fresh riverwaters, and thus give to the outflow a deeper scouring pow.er; I may go further, and say that rivers, otherwise equal, have deeper bars in proportion to the amount of flood-current. Is it not a significant fact that the Rhine, with its great outflow of fresh ~ter 7 fails to maintain a ship-channel to the sea, while, in the same neighborhood, the Scheldt, the Jahde, and the Elbe, have plenty of water on their outer bars 1 · The river is not in all cases, pe1·haps not in a majority of cases the world over, the immediate source of the materials forming its bar, but in the present discussion this makes no difterence; and I consider the following an authorize<l '
GENERAL RULE·

.A river having a bar at its mouth will be injured tJ.8 a pathway for 1uwigatio1i if the tidal influx is reduced by encroacliments upon its basins. · In the abo~e rule I have been careful to speak of the injury as the result of a reductiott of the tidal injluw, because, not only are there rivers where the inflow is nothing, or in small proportion to the rise of the tide, but in all arms of the sea., whether fed by fresh waters or not, the total ti(lal volume (the prism between high and low water surfaees) exceeds the inflow from the ocean, because

78

REPORT OF THE SUPERI1"1'EJSDENT OF

it is not high water at the same moment over the whole basin. · In the Hudson; for instance, there are two co-existing tides, one of them occupying the space between the sea and Poughkeepsie, the other the reach of the river above. The tide of this upper reach is simply a propagation of the preceding tide of the lower reach. At the moment of high water at the mouth of the river, it is low water at Poughkeepsie, and at this instant the prism (which is wedge-shape, its base being the surface of the previous low water, irrespecttve of time) represents all that can have possibly flowed in from sea during the entire period of flood. The effect of an encroachment, as measured in reduction of inflow from the sea, is less and less as we go up the river, till we reach Poughkeepsie, where it becomes nothing. The entire fole aboye this point might be destroyed without lessening the flood-current at the mouth of the river. In a study of rivers we soon discover th.at we must distinguish between those which, escape to the sea through ftords, and those which form their own beds or break through barriers of sand upon the coast. The former are usually without bars, the latter never. The tide plays so small a part in modifying the original features of the ftord that upon the coast of Maine, where the rise is great, we find harbors and channels resembling very closely those upon the western shore of the :Baltic, where there is no tide whatever.. It is only the smaller fiords that have filled up with river deposits and with sand washed in by the wayes; in most of the larger ones the debris have accumulated only in the sheltered angles and basins. The form of the fiord, expanding its section as it approaches the sea, is favorable to the gradual deposit of sediments, whether these are brought down by the river or swept in by the waves. There is, however, no abrupt meeting of fresh and salt water, and no sudden slacking up of river or tidal currents at the sea border, so that outside bars do not often form. In its upper reaches the fiord is often obstructed, because its antecedent inequalities of section have induced the river, in establishing its regimen, to fill in the angles on either side and to raise the bed where the width was great. In such places the diking in of lateral basins, and the contraction of the water-way at some points, may be attended with good results. The history of the Thames shows how steadily the river has improved as the reclamations of its shores have proceeded. The Clyde, also, increased its depth as the levees of rubble were constructed, and without causing injurious deposits elsewhere. * · In both of these cases the general form of the estuary was not changed. The. walls on the two shores were built so as to diverge from each other, very much as the natural shores had done, except that re-entereut angles and irregu· larities were covered up.. In strong contrast with the good effects of parallel works which we have cited, are the injuries done by bridges and other transverse works, both upon the Thames and Clyde. The dikes or dams resorted to for purposes of reclamation belo11g to two orders, which may be designated as paraUel and transverse works; the former comprising all those which follow along the margin of the stream, the latter those which cross the stream from shore to shore. Parallel works.-These are of the two kinds, "insubmersible" and "submersible," the forrner wholly excluding the tides, the latter permitting the overflows for the sake of inducing deposits of sedimentary matter by a process known as ''warping." The general rule we have stated as applicable to harbors having bars must lie reeeived with certain limitations, because the degree of injury <lone by an encroachment depends very much upon the location of the work and its extent.· If we compare charts of different sea-ports together, and . select those which agree in the yielding character of their beds, in their exposure to the sea, and in their tidal and river volumes, we still find the iacilities for navigation unequal, and conclude that the active forces are not equally useful-that some parts are out of a.djustment. In such cases the way to improve upon natural conditions is obviously to enlarge one basin, reduce another, &c. Tlrere are flats too near and others too distant for useful reservoirs ; those very near discharge their tidal volumes in advance of the great outflow from above, upon which the scour over the bar mainly depends; and those too distant do not communicate, by the fall of their tid.e, a motion to the waters at the mouth of the stream till too late for re-enforcement. The element o~ distance also enters in another way, viz: the ebb current, flowing off from. shallow flats, does. not communicate at once it.s motion to the whole mass of the water in the channel, but for a considerable distance does little more than simply quicken the surface-arift.

have shown this by observations, and am satisfied that high flats near the mouths of estuaries may often be reclaimid without injury to the bar, provided the range of the tide in the ri">er above is not thereby diminished. Those fiats are the most useful which discharge their volumes of tide in season for reinforcing the maximum outflow. upon the bar, and which run dry early enough to prevent a eontinuance of outflow at the bar after the tide has begun to rise in the sea. .As we rnO\·e up a stream, then the value of fiatR, in their physical relation to tlie bar, alters materially, depending upon their elevation from point to point, so that finally we reach so distant a point that those flats only which are covered by the highest spring tides have usefulness as reservoirs of power for the scour of the bar-channels. i: would not be understood to say that those particles of water in the reservoirs which tliemselYes reach the mouth of the rfrer in season for co-operation in the scour are alone useful, but those alone whose transmitted pressure shall reach the bar and quicken the outflow at the proper stage. Each case presents a prolJlem which may be satisfactorily solved after a proper gauging of the stream. In Europe the effects of reclamation along:the borders qf tidal streams haYe been Vel'j' far from uniform. The diking-in of marshes, and the closing of canals behind Ostend and L'Ecluse, destroyed those portsi but the diking of the Scheidt has not affected its outside bar, that I can learn. In England some outside bars liave been made worse by parallel works excluding tidewater, and this has led the city of Li\·erpool to guard with jealousy the great reservoir abo,·e that city, the :filling and draining of which maint,ains the channel-ways oYer the bar at the mouth of the Mersey. On the other hand it has been thus far a gain to navigation in many European rivers to fix, by reclamation, the shifting muds and sands near very shallow river mouths, like the Seine, La Vire, the Weser, &c. Perhaps in this connection I cannot do better than quote the testbnony of the highest authority, Thomas Stevenson, esq., who, in 11is work on the "Design and Construction of Harbors," says: "From a comparison made many years ago of different low-water sections of the estuaries_ of various rfrers, and also of bays and creeks in their state of nature, I found that the lou:-u:atcr sectional areas increased directly as the quantities of tide-water that lay landward of eaeh section-line. "The importance of preserving intact the capacitj· of the upper portions of rivers ought ne\'er

to be a matter of any doubt, for although it be perfectly true that contraction benefits the naviga·
tion at the place where it exists, the eftect cannot be otherwise than detrimental to those lower parts of the estuary, including the bar, if there be one, which are in every respect the most important. It has been often proposed that large tracts of land should be reclaimed on the upper iiortious of rivers, and it has been argued that the challllel so constructed will, of course, become deeper than it was before. From calculations subsisting between the low-water sectional areas anrl the amounts of tidal water lying lan(l wards of the sectio.n lines, I found that~ in the narrow artificial channel of the river Dee, Cheshire, the efficacy of a given quantity of tidal water was greater than in navigations which were left more nearly in a state of nature. But, as already stated, the effect of excluding water being prejudicial t-0 the lower reaches, ought t-0 lead us to 1Jther means of impron·ment than the erection of such high bulwarks. "The effect of low-water training-walls which do not confine the strength of the current, !Jut simply guide the first of the flood. and the last of the ebb-tide, arc now well known from their extensive employment, as, for example, on the Clyde, Ribble, Lune, Nith, and other rivers." If it becomes necessary in any portion of a tidal stream to improve the depth of the channel, this should be done by first removing the material with a dredge, and then coatractiug the lowwater space by submersible dikes or training-walls .. If the locality requiring improvement is low d-0wn the stream, so that half-tide dikes will be exposed, while the discharge from above is still active, they will really accomplish as much as levees, and without incurring any injurious loss of tide on the bar. In the Elbe, below Hamburg, there had existed since an unknown period a shoal, .which the Clity,finally decided to remove by dredging, and did so a few years ago. This shoal has, however, formed again, and, what is most curious, the new shoal is of sand, whereas the old one was of clay. The case presented was pr9bably 'that of a neutral spot, where, below a certain depth, the forces (dood, ebb, and river outflows) were in equilibrium. A physical survey would have detected this and saved the waste of labor. In order to preserve an artificial depth, a new direction

or energy must be given .to the stream by proper dikes. Many persons look at the bar at the mouth of a river as the result of long accumulation and gradual accretion. Lambiardie computed the age of the 'l'rou\ille Shoal in the estuary of the Seine at three thousand ~·ears. lify own experience of sandJ· shoals is that they have no such history; the shifting bottom arranges itself iu hills and Ya.lleys precisely as the active forces will 11errnit, and a saml-slloal removed by the dredge will be restored almm1t immediately. I have se~n shoals in North Carolina that moved bodily to and fro with every tide, presening the same height and much the same figure from day to day and from ;year to year. The attempt of the United States Enginerrs, many years ago, to cut a channel-way through the bar of Nantucket Harbor, utterly failed; it was like ~aliug out the sen. In ·studying the sand-banks of New York Harbor, I showed from observations that thlly lay in the equilibrium points among the tidal currents and wave,;, ani1 I think most of them woultl form again in a week if suddenly swept away. As we ha\e seen, lc\ces are open to the ol\jeetion that they dimini8h the tidal influx and reflux; this oqjection does not hold against submersible dikes or training; walls, which, as far as I can learn, have been equally successful as means of improving the l-0cal depths of channels. ~ otable instances of their success are offered at t1ie Helder, in the Seine, the Thames, the Dee, and in the Clyde. It is especially in the lower courses of tiUal streams that training-walls are e:ffectual. They do not essentially diminish the volume of tidal inflow nor quickeit the flood-curl'ent. The greatest volnme·passes into a tidal river after tlie tide has risen half its height, or when the training-wall is submerged and escapes into the sea again after the tide has fallen below half-tide, so as to uncover the wall, ancl confine the ehh-stream, now much quickened, to the channel. In the case of the Clyde, not only were training-walls built belou; Glasgow, but ol.lstruetions, caused by weirs and bridges above, we1·e removed or reduced, so that the tide made a longer inland joumey. The opposite course was pursued by the FreDch engineers in their attempts t-0 improve the Adonr. Upright walls of masory were built on either side of the rinir, slig·htly converging as they reached the sea, and the consequence has been a reduction of the tidal range at Bayonne, and no improvement, except that the bar-channel no longer shifts its position. Efforts are being made to carry these walls out beyond the bar of the Adour, but few believe in tbc ultimate valne of this costly work. The construction of submersible dikes is often resorted to in connection with projects of reclamation, but not always with the design of ultimately raising these works so as wholly to exclude the tide, although the direct object is always to induce accumulation by a process called iu England warping. In the low countries of Holland and Germany warping is resorted to for the sake of creating fore-shore protection of reclaimed lands. Beyond the main dik~ a low parallel wall of rubble or fascinage is built, at a distance of a few hundred feet, and the inclosed space divided into pens or catch-basins, to be filled with sediments at the high tide or during river-floods, when these walls aJ"e submerged. The Prussian government has pro-vided in this way for the future protection oLthe dikes in the neighborhood of the naval station at Heppeus on the Jahde.* On the banks of rapid streams, or those subject to 1loods, fore-shore protections outside of the dikes are absolutely indispensable. 'l'hese are frequently provided by constructing groynes or jetties of rubble or fascinage, but these are objectionable, not only because they disturb the flow of the stream, creating eddies, &c., bu.t because thty are really poor economy, since in the course of time they have to be increased number till they consume more material than longitudinal trainingwalls. W eibking says that the experience of many ~·ears upon the Rhine has shown that groynes for fore-shore protection must not be more than their length apart. On the Clyde groynes were originally resorted to, but ultimately it became necessary to connect the outer ends of these by training-walls. An exceptional case is offered by the tidal river Tees, where groynes have been used with decided success. Tran$Verse wMks.-Weirs- an<\ sluice-bridges involve all _the objections that w~ have offered against encroachments upon tide-water, since they completely arrest the progress of the tide. The testimony of history is decidedly against them, and I shall content myself with simrly quoting ·

notable facts from the highest autl10rities to which I have access. In doing this it will not he necessary to distinguish between works thrown across streams for the purpose of ele·ating the back-waters, and those constructed for drainage, since in their effects upon the lower reaches they do not differ. Bounicean, in liis "f:tndes sur la Na>igation des Rivieres a ~Iarees," declares that transverse dams ought to be proscribed in the maritime portions of rivers-that "their existence is only injurious to navigation.'1' He cites the cases of the river Aure, which had been ishoaled over three feet by the effect of a sluice-bridge, and of the approaches to lsign~-, which were sanded np in consequence of a sluice-dam across the Vire. The council of the Ponts et Chaussees recommended the removal of this sluice-bri(lgci declaring that it hag. destroyed maritime naYigation, because, being furnislied with gaiP,;, it liad 11imlered the oscillation of the flood an<l ebb. The obstruction was remand and the tidef; resumed their good offices as of old. l\Ir. Cordier, in 1828, wrote the follo"·ing opinion co11ccrni11g the effects of sluice"dams above the Port of Dunkerque: ''Twice a day the tide inundated thP yast plain of \Valteringues and twice retired, so that tlii8 port was tranrscd four times per day liy au immeusc current, which opened the channel and maintained the passes from the roadstcad. Since the constrndion of this sluice-dam, natural scour has ceased, and deposits ha\·e closed tlw eJ1tranee to the port. The shore, which extends itiself more aud more, has become continuous, and the passes from tlrn roadstead ha,-e shrunk up." Again, with regard to the sluice-dam at GranlineFo, the Foanrn writer says: ''The same movements took place at Gra.-elines; the sea sub111t·rg·el1 the territory as far up as St. Omer, at that time accessible to ships, and covered twice a day a plain many leagncf' squnrc; a broad and· deep channel was maintained from Gravelines, and the creek, opt>IH'tl at tLe foot of the dnnes from Grnveliues to Dunkerquc by the natural iscour, fayorcd the na dgation and contributed to the amelioration of the two ports; the sluices of Gravelines have chimgt·d these conditious, the sea has been held back, the cliannel is filled up, and this port, fonrlerly wry good, is e.8sentially lost." De Prony favored only a islnice-clam upon the sea-margiu, where it shonltl form a continuation of the coast and lcayc no angle of r(·posc for sands to gather. He had observed that the gravel traveling along the north coast of France rested nowhere except in sheltered angles, the nwuths of rirnrs, &c. I conceive that this distingni:>hed s~rrnut had in view only the navigation of the Seine, and believed that if the weir were not placed at the Yery mouth of the estuary, the saud would so accumulate below that the approach for ships from 'Sea could not be preserved. Precisely this has been the experience at Boston, (England.) Smeaton built the Boston sluice with the expressed design of keeping out the ti<le-watt'l'. In 1120 Yessels of two hundred and fifty to three hundred tons (the largest then in ordinary use·) could run up and discharge at the quays. Now, in seasons of low riYer water, the sluice-gate has ten to cle\·cn feet of saud piled up against it on the seaward side. Rye Harbor suffered the same wa~·. A sluice recently constructed on the Nene, fourteen miles from the sea, pro·ed such an injury that the mob tore it up two and a half years after its erection. The sand accumulated llelow the sluice, but on the removal of the structure was at once swept away by the tide. The ohl Rhine, passing through North Hollan<;}, had been gradually narrowed down by reclamations till its· natuml outlet could not be sufficiently preserved, even for drainage purposes, aucl recourse was had to De Prony's plan of constructing the sluice of Katwijk at the margin of the open sea. Commenting upon this, a writer in the "Engineer and Architects' Journal," 1846, says: "The fate of the old Rhine has been aptly compared t-0 that of a dethroned monarch, who is deprived even of tltc satisfaction of attracting admiration and s_ympatl1.r hy the grandeur of his exit." The first effects of a loss of tidal volume is usually a narrowing of the channel below rather than a diminution of depth along the channel-way. This seems to have been tlie experience in Boston Harbor, Massachusetts, and very conspicuously in the North River, lfassaclmsetts. In this latter case an overflow of the sea, during the Minot's gale of 1851, constructed a shingle-bar across the stream about a mile above its mouth, thereby shutting out three-fifths of the tidal v9lume which formerly passed up. The recent surveys show that as a result of this loss the channel below the obstruction has gradually declined in width, especially at the mouth, while the central depth has remained essentially the same. 'rhe hiatory of the Humber, which upon positive data extends baek to 1684, furnishes the most remarkable instance that I can cite of a first-class port that has been damaged in its approaches

by loss of tide-water due to reclamations. In the eocliest reliable charts, ten, eleven, and twelve fathoms could be tracked in from the sea, and the narrowest place in the approach to the shelter of the estuary was one and a half miles between the five-fathom curves, and no outside shoals existed. Now the principal dangers lie two miles outside of the shelter, where a narrow channel of five fathoms (marked by t\vo light-ships) meanders among shoals of sand. In the interval between the two periods, the original four hundred square miles o~ tidal area has been reduced to one hundred and ten.* M,Y own experiments in New York Harbor, at the mouth of the Hudson, showed, from sub.current observations, that an increase of fresh-water discharge did not increase but really diminished the seaward scour on the beds of the deep channels; and it was inferred that in the dry season, when the sea-water was carried higher up tlie river, a deeper flow of the ebb was induced because of the greater density of the water. I have followed the sea-water along the bed , of the Hudson fort~' miles above Its mouth. Physical history of salt-marsltes.-In what I ha>e heretofore said of the relationl:l of currents, &c., to the channels which they trayerse, I have drawn upon my experience and studies with a degree of confidence; but in the comments which I now propose to make upon the, origin of the salt-marshes I enter upon a subject rather new to me, and although I shall still confine myself at1 closely as possible to the results of observation, I am not at all tenacious of my inductions, but ofter them with the hope of eliciting better information upon the subject. To my mind, the salt-marshes along our coast are not fully accounted for under the terms "glacial paste," and river debris. They do not appear to me as detritus from the interior, but, in the main, as products of the waste of tl1e coast. It is not only at the moutlts of rivers, or at the bases of great continental slopes that these appear, b11t we find them in coves and dead angles of the shore, wherever the coast is falling back before the dash of the sea; not only upon the borders of the mainland, far from any considerable issue of land-waters, but also upon islands wide out at sea, where there is scarc.-ely any water-shed. When a headland cri1mbles down in the attack of the waves, the materials are assorted almost immediately; the coarse sand, gravel, and stones are strewn along to form the littoral cord1m, but the finer materials are held in suspension till they find opportunity to settle in sheltered places, perhaps under the lee of the cordon itself. Upon our New England shore 1 distinguish, as the result of this sifting action of the sea, three distinct categories, yi;;: beech-sand, shingle, and marshmuds. The separation among these results from their different sizes an\l weights, which give them different rates of travel along the shore, under the action of waves whose directions are oblique to that of the general coast-line. The angles and coves are cut off and formed into bights, and ultimately into lagoons, by strips of beach which cross them, and upon these strips of beach shinglelevees form at a later period. As the construction of this breakwater progresses, the basin within becomes tranquil, so as to admit of the precipitation of the suspended material forming our third category, and the marl:lh begins to form under the protection of a natural dike.. The littoral cordon thus created has a tendency toward complete closure, since the 09nstructive power of the waves is often out of all proportion with the scouring action of river and tidal curre11ts. These lagoons at best can preserve but narrow outlets, and very often these are closed for long periods-long enough for the marsh to freshen, and, perhaps, become grown over with forests. The material that would -remain suspended only so long as the agitation of the sea continued must be of limited range, and if of uniform character,(quartz sand, for instance,) it must be of almost uniformly small size, because the waves can only suspend those things whose weights are in small proportion to their surfaces. We ought to expect to find in the sediment within the 1ittoral cordon great homogeneity if these are products from the waste of the coast, and we do find that marshes :possess this character generally. Professor Agassiz and others ha'l"e called my attention to the fact that, at considerable depths imder some of the salt marshes, deposits of peat are found. I offer the sugge11tion that this dep0sit, circumstances antecedent, of course, to the superimposed marsh, is antecedent also to the order under which the material from outside has found its way to the same resting-place. I have, in a preceding portion of this paper, spoken of the narrowing of harbor cha.nnels, which often precedes

any central shoaling. Specimens from the most depressed portions of channels often rc\'eal the character of the deposits antecedent to those taking place at the present time. In Boston Harbor, a deposit of peat is said to exist by Mr. Boschke, who has been dredging in the axis of the main ship-channel, where no ttccunmlatfons within the last century (at least) have occurred. Upon the beds of quiet basins vegetation Jllays a constructive part. The Zostera marina (eelgrass) arr~sts and fixes the sediments of the sea very much as the beach-grass catches the flying dune-sands upon the shore. In the Petite Rade of Toulon, an elevation of the bottom, two and a half feet in the average in thirty years, was attributed to the luxuriant growth of eel-grass of a species closely allied to our own. _\Ve observe the same thing in our own ports, and should expect the filling up of a basin to go on till the whole surface is above the ordinary reach of the sea. When the subject of reclamation of tide-lands was first proposed to me as theme, I considered the initial step was to ascertain the eleyations of the marshes. This led me very q,uickly to the discovery that their nearly horizontal surfaces are at the plane of mean high water. I compared the ma~spes on the two shores of the narrow isthmus between Cape Cod and Buzzard's Bays, where we had careful connecting lines of levels and gcod series of tidal observations. I found that the marshes on either side differed but about one-tenth of a foot from the local elerntion of mean high water; so that we have here, within six miles of each other, two systems of marshes, differing in eievation as much as the planes of high water, i. e,, the marshes on the Cape Cod Bay side are two and a half feet higher than those on the Buzzard's Bay side. I then inquired into tlm len~ls of marshes high up in the Bay of Fundy, and computed, from some le>elings made by the Roy;tl Engineers, that the plane of the marshes lies about half-way between the 11igh waters of springs and neaps, or at the mean high-water plane. So, in San Francisco Bay, as well as I could judge from short series of observations, the marsh-plane is the ordinary high-water level. It appears, then, that the sea has exercised an important control upon the marsh, and this iR circumstantial e>idence that these marshes belong to the present tidal epoch, and that the sea has played an intimate part in their formation. · Leaving out of the question the deltas of rivers, it is a fact, well known to practical engineers, that deposits of sediments take place in harbors and docks, and that the amount accumulating in tidal waters is much greater than elsewhere. According to Minard, (as cited b,\' Stewnson in his work'On harbors,) the sedimentary deposit in basins a.long the almost tideless shores of the l\Iediterranean, is not one-sixtieth part as great as in those similarly situated on tllc Atlantic and North Sea. This testimony of )Iinard is, no doubt, an exaggeration, because it is bm;ed upon docks, &c. If channels alone were compared, the results would have been quite of an opposite character. In tidal harbors. the deposits are not uniformly distributed over the bottom; the channel-ways are swept out by the currents, and the angles of the shores filled up. . My own comparison of the charts of the Mediterranean with those of tidal seas confirms me in this view, and I can but regard the tides as exceedingly valuable agencies in preserving the avenues of navigation. In some of our ports, in New York, for instance, channels that are hourly traversed by steamers are gradually deepening; because the bottom is stirred, so that the tidal current can bear away material which it could not otherwise lift. . Let us now inquire if there.is any evidence that the ma,rshes are incr<iasing, and whether this increase is particularly striking in neighborhoods where the coast is wearing away. I could furnish some small instances of growing marshes in our own country, but I think it sater to refer to the changes in the Old "World, where the comparat.ive surveys cover several centuries, and where remarkable cases have attracted observation. To European engineers the increase of certain marshes is a fact so well recognized, that methods have been devised by them for lending aid to nature in this formation of new lands. These methods are known in England under the general designation of." warping," which I have already referred to under the head of "parallel works." In comparing the results reported by engineers of different countries, I was not surprised to find that the success of warping near the coast has been very unequal in different looa.lities, and that, with other things the same, it is greatest in neighborhoods where the coast is falling back. Warping is employed in Holland to add fore-shore for the protection of the dikes, but would not

pay simply as a means of reclamation in the mouths of the Rhine, where the yearly deposit is but a thin film. In the estuary of the Ilumber, on the othf'r hand, the warpiug is wholly for the enlargement of agricultural districts. For distances of fol'ty miles above aud below tlie mouth of this stream, the coast has fallen back ten feet per year, accor1li11g to the dift'ereut surveys since 1G84, wllich represents an enm·mous volume, because the coast is generally high, (thirty to forty feet.) The recent grow.tbs of the marshes in this estuary are attrilrnted to material from outside by Professor Philips in his "Geology of the Yorkshire Coast," and seems to be the only reasonable way for accounting for such enormous deposits at tlie mouth of so small a river. For instance, Sunk Island, near the mouth of the estuary, which, in the time of Charles First, contained nine acres of diked laud, now has seven thousand acres unuer tultirntion, and c-0vers the site of a twelve-foot channel- as given on several early cbarts.· Tbe warping pract.iced in this estuary accomplishes generally one foot of elevation per anuum, although Col1~mau's '' European .Agriculture" mentions a case of "ten or fifteen acres warped t0 a thickness of oue to t11ree feet dQring ten to twelve tides." I find in these accounts of the Ilmnuer estuary that the greatest deposit within the submersible dikes is during the dry season. This I consider a siguificaut fact, iildicatiug that in proportion as the flood-current (bringing se(limeuts from outside) is of long duration, the warping suceeeus. Ferdinanu de Lesseps, in one of his early reports,t attempted to discreuit the' ancient idea that the delta is the gift of the Nile, and in this ab1;uru enueavor he cited some co.Hater.al eviuence which serves my turn better than it did his. .An analysis of the deposits in the Bay of Saint .Michel shows that the material is from the adjacent coast, which is retreating. .An examination in the Seine showed that the river debris uid not extend below Rouen, and that the 'lilhoals forming in the estuary below were from the wear of tbe coast. "' arping is practiced with success at the hea1l of the Hay of Fund_y, where extensive marshes have been rnclaimed. The flood tidal current brings with it great burdens of m1.1d. Here the narrow isthmus affortls no considerable water-shed, and the water e\'idently owes its turbid cl1aracter to the rush of the tide along its bed, and to the wear of the shores below. Even at our southern inlets, where the sifting operation woulu seem to be finished, and where the cordon would seem to have. reached a state of equilibrium, the flood-current anu the water pushed in by the rush of the sea is often milky with the quartz-dust which the grinlli11g breakers supply. From the very nature of the flood-current (divergent) it pres,;es upon the coast and receives for transportation all the waste of the shore, and all the fine material gronuu up by the breakers. The "bulkheads'' within our southern inlets seem to be composed of the fiue sand brought in from outside, while the outer bar is but the mass of mate1fal from the site of the inlet itself. In some of the lagoons of the Mediterranean shore, warping is practiccu upon waters that fl.ow in from the sea. .Along some coasts there is a mass of material traveling along. shore and ready to seek rest in any cove or shelter, especially where encouraged by the fioou-cnrrent, which, as I have said, is eminently a coastwise stream. Lieutenant, now .Admiral Davis, first called special attention to the constructive character of the flood-current, in his articles before the .American .Academy, .upon which I shall hereafter have occasion to comment. According to Bonniceau, (Etudes et Mtions sur les constructions li la rner,) to. bring the. stra.nd to the level of high water by warping, requires tweh·e years in the estuary of the Seine, thirty in the bay ofVays, and eighty in the Sheldt. · The littoral cordon is a developing physical phenomenon of the coast, distinguishing peculiarly, I think, the present geological period, and perhaps the most interesting and important amo!lg the changing features exhibited by our comparative surveys. It appears upon our New England coaat as isolated strips of beach or shingle levees, crossing the months of fiords and coves; but upon our southern sea-board it is the grand, characteristic, and is almost continu<>nB from Moutank to the coral reefs of Florida, and from St. Marks to Yucatan.:j: Except at Long Branch, I can remember no locality below Montauk whe_re· the antecedent drift-formation reaches

the sea, and I conceive that those long rifts, like Hatteras Banks, which lie many miles from the main-land, occupy what was (perhaps at the time the glaciers melted) the bref!cker-liue upou the shallow bauk which formed the submerged prolougatiou of the coutiueut, which has here but a slight inclination toward the ocean. This windrow of sancl I beliHve to be Yery gradually fallmg back; the fine sand grou!l(l up by tl.ie sea is caught up by the winds and formed into dunes, or forced tluougll the inlets l1y the rush of the wayes ancl fiood-current, to be. converted into flats aJHl marshes.· The tendency of the natural forces 11ow operating upon the coast sremfi to be toward a complete smoothing away of all the i11dentures of the shore-line. I use the word indentures, hecauRe I would not imply that great bends and gulfs are to disappear. \Ve are naturally prone to the beli<·f that w~atwe call the orderly actiYities of nature are workiug out an equilihrium, and tl1is has induced a. preYalent notion that the Rea is robbing the conti11cnt of material to tHI up the i11equalities of its bed. .As far as my olnservatious lmYe extended, there seems to he little grnu11d for this notion, aud I am inclined to tltiuk with Hear-Admiral D:wis that the sea" e;jects or n·pels" the delJris of the continent that would fall into its bosom.+ I do not agree with the sanm whose words I haYe quoted, in giving to the floocl-current tue Jffincipal part in the "f'.iection" of rnaterials, aml it seems to me tlrnt the evidence he cites bears witness rather to the action of waves than to that of running water. It is a farniliar fact that w:wes running OYer shallow ground acquire a real motion of translation. The passing of a w:we a:;; felt by divers, standing upon the bottom, is a sudden jerk toward the coast. 'l'he water that would thus pile up against the shore is carried hack into tht> O<'.t'<lll hy a geueral and continueJl current. The rnoYemeut toward the laud is iu vn.r short lmt Yery rapid dashes, while the return is more gentle and stead.)·. In this contrast of ,-elocities bptwern the ouset aml the retreat of the sea, lies, I think, tlle true cause of tlle accumulations upon the coa;.;t arnl the tendency of heavy llodies, like tlte coal from steamers, &-c., to come on sllore. ·when we consider that tlle u·ork done is 111;oportional to the squa1·e of the velocity, and that the weight that ma,> be rno,·ed by running water varies witll the si,rth power ti.f tlte relocity, we certainl.Y may expect the change,; along tlte coast to ~·cftect rather the action of rushing w;iyes than feeble cnrn·uts. ::\ly own oh.sern1tions along tlie coast of Long Island showed that an eastwardl;r current pren1ilet1, but that the sands near the beach mo\·ed before the sea to tbe westward. U11der cirenmsta11ces ari:;;iug from the peculiar coufiguratiou of the shore, or from its exposure, the wa\·es at some points along the coast arc prone to run Yery high, and dm-elop great transporting power. It i8 particularly noticeable ' that gulfi:l and bays which open in the direction from which heavy gales frequently blow, are extending without any diminution of average depth along their axial lines, except where rocks resist for a while the wear of the sea. As a11 example, and a good one, because resting upon positiYe knowledge, I offer the case of the Gulf of GaRcons in the neighborhood of 8t .·Tcan de Luz, where repeatetl surYe,ys show that the submerged contours are falling back, and the bay actually extending and deepening. The material scour.ed mrny is ground up fine bJ- tlic \ntYcs, cast upon the beach, and finally blown mrny in dunes toward the interio1'.t The bight of Cape Cotl llay helo\\' the Plymouth Entrance bears en~rytmce of a11 encroaching sea. The water i,; hold close in-Rbore, so that a man-of-war may ride at anchor within what was probably the ba::ie of the high hill, wlJm;e remaining portion bears the name of Peaked Bluff. The warns have carried none of the material seaward, (of this we are sm·e from the character of the bottom,) but have swept it aloug· shore to the eastwar<l, the fine sands to be formed into dunes, and the shingle to be moved 011 a11tl :1ccnmulated until it i,;hall becorne equal to the protection of the shore hJ' resisting the onsd of the sea. I bave not, in our repeated snrn'ys, seen the slightest eYidence that the material of the falling bluffs of Boston Bay are borne ont to seli; I think the harbors and coves ham reei~il«·<l it all.

no doubt peculiarly favorable to the augmentatiou of the carrying powers of ordinary waves driving in from the sea, and to these combined aCJtions I attribute tlH' turbid state of the waters near the head of ibis gulf, where the title is so laden with secliml'!nts that warping is suecessfully practiced. Mr. A. Savary, an engineer residing at East "\Varcham, has written me an able and w~ry interesting communication concerning Buzzard's Bay, in which lie giv('S fil(' the results of observations,some of them stated numerically, which show that the sheltered l!asins at the npper end of the bay are filling np with sand and stones torn from headlands below, which are wasting under the action of the waves cluring southerly gales. Some of these basins, he says, are used for planting oysters, and, from his own experience, states that aft+>r a gale the oysters m·c always found higher up the stream. He, however, attributes this movement altogethe-r to thf\ flornl-cnrmnt," aud n;akes it dependent upon the depth of superincumbeul water, a conclusion that seems to be oppo:sed to wellestablished laws of hydrod,rnamtcs, although I am aware tllat smile English engineers of eminence, among them 1\fr. Calver, still insist upon making weight an element in tlie friction of running water. The views I have entertained relatfrc to the restoratiou to tlie eontincnt of all the material washed from its bluffs and headlands by the sea, mm;t Im moclifil>d when we come to consider islands. 'Vhere these are crumbling down under the action of the waves, we usually see a loss upon the windward shore, and a reappearance of the material upon the kcwanl side. Sometimes we find two hooks exh~nding leeward from either end of a wa:-ltiug island, as in the case of Nantucket, and these hooks, in other cases, unite under the lee and inclo~c> la:;;oon:-:, which ultimately become, perhaps, marshes. High islands may thus gradually he conYcrted in low atolls, (if I may use this tf\rm,) which occupy more than their original share of the occ:m hell. 'rlwre are, however, many cases where the wasted material does not reappt·ar, most 1n·ornine11t amo11g which is the familiar instance of Hclgoland, a loft.y islau<l, which was onee man~- tirnei-; its JH"(·srnt arra. A fringe of salt-marsh is sometimes seen along the·coa~t, outside of Llte littoral cordon, showing that the latter has been forced back over the marsl1ei-; formerly lying withi11 irs protection; and, as this outl,ring marsh is seen onl.Y at very low tide8, in mo1't casrs, it has been cited as an evidence of a general submergence. I suggest that the falliug back of t11e hea\'y natural dike over the marsh may have depressed the latter, or where this lms not· occurred~ that the sea has undermined the marsh and let it down. No earthy material resistR the action of the Rea better than salt-marsh; but below the vegetable soil, at a con-siderahle depth, there is often quicksand that might easily be washed out by the sea. I know of an instance where a very high dune, in falling back from the coast, left. exposed beneath the sea an old 8alt-marsh, upon which it had been resting for many Jears, and which it appears to have crushed down by its weight. On the other hand, the shingl~-levee on the Scituate shore does not dc1ircss the marsh as it rolls back over it, although the weight is over 1,500 pounds to the square foot. After inclosure and drainage, i;alt-marshes nsualt¥ sink, -sometimes largely by their own weight, where the substratum is peat or quicksand, and sometimes only the amount due to i;hrinkage. Slumps of twelve feet have occurred in Holland. The Bisch-l3osch, and a large part of the Zuyder-Zee, lie over ancient folders. It may be that marshes have sometimes dried up and sunk after the natural closure of the "littoral cordon," and again, aftel' a long period, have been exposed . to the sea by the destruction or falling back of the cordon. I have seen no case of submerged marshes that seems to me to be worth much in support of a theory of general submergence. Most of the marshes along our coast, like those of the Netherlands and the west coast of Denmark, lie within the "littoral cordon;" and in the course of· the practical operations of the past season, which form the su hjeet of the second part of this report, I have been led into special studies of the shingle-levees. These natural dikes have some characteristics which are general and tleserving of comment, I think, aside from their particular bearing upon projects of reclamation. Shingle-levees.-English observers are pretty well agreed upon tho following characteristic8 of shingle-levees: 1st. The largest pebbles are found upon the summit and farthest from the source of supply. 2d. The fore-slope is a series of" fulls" or berms.

To these rules or general point of resemblance, my own experience adds the following: 3d. 'l'he seaward slope, near the crest, is 3: 1, while the mean is 5: 1. 4th. ·wbile upon t.he one lu!A!ld tlie fore-slope is diyersified by horizontal fulls oc berms, the rearslope, in striking contrast, is an alternation of rertical furrows and buttresses. The front face takes the form best calculated tu resi&t the attacks of the sea, while the rear side takes the form best .adapted to the rapia escape of oYerffowing water, as far as this is consistent with the security of the base. The lwst explanatiou that 1 have seen of tlle first rule above stated is implied in the following _quotation from l'almer's paper iu the l'llil. Traus. of 1834: "In all cases we observe that the finer particles descend tht' whole distancp witli tlw returning breaker unless accidentally deposited in some interstices, bnt we perneiYe that ti.le larger Jlebbles return onl.r a part of the 1listance; and upon further inspection, we find that the distance to which each pebble returns hears some relation to its dirneusionR.'' The sea, in its onset, i8 an irresistible force, which, upon its sudden 1l1·strnctfon, would leave a wall of stones, mingling all sizes and weights imliscriminately. The reflux or midertow, howeYer, carries back t1fe smallel' stufl~ aud forrns with it a talus slope. \Ve see, then, that the average size of the stoues Rhould be greater near the top, and that the fore-slope should be less and less steep as we go rlow11 to the foot. It has b1w11 snggrsted that the breaking Sl'a is an explosiYe foi·ee, and that, therefore, tile larger stoues should go fnrU1er tila11 others; but rn.r obseiTation has been that there is no a:>sortiug proee,.;s in the hreaker, hut simply a .Yelection in the recoil. If the lteight of tlw kvce fa i11 proporti<>u to that, of the stom1-.8ea, we should expect tlrnt .tlw slopes of all le,-ees of the same matt>l'ial would Le in the o;ame order under the above theory, and this is my expcl'ienee thus fal' i11 this stml,,-. The slopes are those of repoo;e in running water. Calaml eoustmetetl the great dik1· of \Vest Capelle under the conYiction that the action transmitted hy the shock of the waws should ntry with the s11uarc of the height of t.he,water coveringthe talus, an<l that the hase of the fore-slope of a dike sho&ld be in proportion to the square of tile height."' I cannot find iu nature any rule of eonstrnetiou like this. In the cornparison of shingle. le\-ees of different heights, l tfotl the Hlopes com;taut; in othe1· words, the base of the fore-slope varies witl'I the first power of the lwight. I find from my notes that on the occasitm of m.'· dsit to Petten, North Holland, l\Ir. Conrad was busy in pitching the fore-slope of the great <like with basalt blocks at slopes of ;) : 1 aml 5 : 1, but .in the reverse of tile natural order, i. he placed the steeper slope below the other. This seems to have been a foqn arrh-ed at from seYeral r'eutu~·ies of recorded experience.+ The fulls or bcrnrn, which appeai· upop. the seaward face of the natural dike, are miniature levees, thrown up uy the lesser storm seas and superimposed upon the main structure. They add to the security or the dike, since they serve to break up the sea. It is a fundamental idea, already fully recognized by engineers, that the difficulty and cost of building a wall that will resist at once the dash of the breakers, is out of all proportion with the facility with which the attack may be resisted lly a succt>ssiou of obstacles. I was shown, in 18G8, an artificial structure in the form of a 8ta'irway upou the shore of l\Iedoc, which was said to have withstood the shock of the great seas of the bay of Biscay better than anJ·thing yet deYised. So, also, as a parallel to the· form of the rear-slope, I fiml in the cuts of railways that the sand-banks on either hand du not reach the conditions of proper drainage and' repose, so as to be permanently covered with grass, till corrugated or furrowed Yertically, and I have seen cases in France where the skillful engineer, anticipating tlte slow processes of nature, put his slopes at once into this permanent form. Other nafaml levees.-The general rules I have laid down apply t-0 shingle-le\·ees exclnsivelythat is to say, to those levees which are composed of stones rounded aml water-worn. Occasionally levees of angular stones are met with upon our coast, and I have seen them in the Bahamas composed of shells, and on the lake shores of drift.. wood. The slopes and hei~hts vary with the different materials in a manner that I do not yet understand. At Nahant there is a short levee of angular blocks broken from a projecting ledge near by, the largest pieces being at or near the

summit, where they occasionally measure over three cubic feet each. rrhe height of this levee is about 0.75 of that of the shingle-levee in the same neighborhooll, aml its fore-slope is less abrupt. Pl'Ofessor Agassil has furnished me with evidence of the "cry re~nt origin of this kwe, which I shall quote hereafter. I>crhapR the most 8ingnlar freak of the sea in the way of dikc-lmilding is to be fonud upon Salt Key, one of tlJ{' smallest of the Bahama Islands. Here occurs an almost perpendicular wall, · about twel\·e feet high, consisting wholly of cQnch-shells, nearly all of them iierfect. One might suppoRc from the uniform height of this "\\all, and its perfect alignment, that it" was a work of art, excPpt tltat to build a "dry wall'' of conch-shells would rather puzzle human ingenuity.* In my pllst season's work I have measured several lc\'ees, for the pnrpose of ascertaining how high the Reas ruu upon the coast; the overflO\\" of these being rare and notable circumsta.uces to the pt>r11ons in the 11eighborl10od. In the second part of this report I haYe giYen the elements for protilt·s of sections. The fore-slopes, where the material is shingle, h:we beea a: 1 for maximum and 5: 1 for mean. The highm;t shingle-ltwee in the world is Chesil Ilank, on the south coast of England, in a situation peculiarly expol'led to the violent seas that rush into the chauucl. Its height varies from twenty-three to forty-three feet along a diRtance of ten-miles. The iueliua.tion of the fore-slope in the most perfect part of thi11 lt>vee is 5: 1. Upon the bonlers of tl!e Bay of Audierue, in Brittany, there is a shingle-lone nearly eight miles in length, whose average height is sixteen feet-the same as our hwen at Seitnate, and, like tlm latter, its se:nninl fate is a series of berms. The fore-slope is 3: 1. "The shingle-levee," says Beaumont, " when Yicwed as au isolated phenomenon, merits but little attention, but in its relations to other phenomena we recognize that it has a great influence upon a crowd of important facts." I think, a::; a rule; the shingle-leYee, as such, cannot be traceil below ordinary high water, "so that it is dceidctlls a sturm-record. 'With no desire to involrn myself in the di¥cns:sion of wave theories, I must 11tate one point, because of its bearing upo11 my general subject. Tlw positive and negative, or croicn arnl hollu1c portions of a storm wave, are of u11~qual height, so that the rise abo>e the sea-Ie,-el (plane of equal Yolumei>) is considerably greater than the fall below. Uany shoals, whose depths given upon our charts arc Ii;11s than half the range of ordinary storm-waves, have never been seen exposed in the trough of the sea. Some ;years since a hea.-ily laden ship, drawing about c1gl1ten feet of water, was dri\'en by an easterly gale across several of the Nantucket shoals, upon which, according to our maps~ the depths scarct\ly exceed eleven foet. ·she struck heavily many times, hut the leadsman never called· less water ihan the chart indicated. Standing npon the beach during a heavy storm, one rarely sees, as the waves retire, much more of the strand than in ordinary weather; and Robinson Crusoe's thrilling account of his race for life across the floor of the ocean, during the recoil of the sea, disturbs our confidence in liim at the outset of his narrative. The dikes along the coasts of Europe may he said to furnish limiting measures of the heights of O\'erflows not wholly local in their significance. Until a comparatfrely late period, the sea-dikes in Holstein and Schleswig were raised but ten feet, and in Holland hut ten to thirteen feet above ·ordinary high-water mark. Modern engineers, however, have carried these works to greater elevations. On the Schleswig coast, eighteen and .a half feet above the highest spring tides is regarded as entirely safe.t On the Dutch coast, after a recorded experience of four hundred years, the grand dike of Petten has been carried up to twenty-one feet· above ordinary high water,t and upon tbe Mediterranean shore of France sixteen and a half feet is proposed for new works.§ As the injury suffered by sea-dikes has been principally due to the rush of water down t,he landward slopes during overflows, it hll8 been deemed prudent to raise the crest of the most exposed and important works to the extraordinary heights I have stated.II

Breakwaters do not furnish what I have termed ''limiting· measures," lleeause rnauy of them have been built with the expectation that storm-seas would leap over them, while others have been carried high for the sake of tteight. Although most of the breakwaters ha\·e been built in situations already partially sheltered, there are instances where they Lave beeu more exposed than the adjacent coastR.
PROFESSOR PEIRCE'S ClUTERION.

This is a rule for deciding upon the propriety of attempting to reclaim tlie marshes of a tidal rfrer by the constr~ction of a transYerse sluice-dam. It was offered expressly for a guide fo the cases before the Jl.Iassachu·setts Boanl of Harbor Commissioners, and finds its ]Jlace properly in this portion of n1y report. _ "Draw a t1wr1ent to the tidal cur cc at tl1e point tdien~ the tidal Cllrrent chauges from elJ/1 to fluo(]; if this tangent intersects the descending branch, the reclamation will preserte from ore1:tl01c all the land tchiclt is higlw1· than the point of intersection." Iu explanation of the aboYe, it is simply necessary to state that tlie ri\-er supply is regarded as uniform 1 and therefore to be represented upon the diagram as a straight line, whicll tm, of cour;;e, be tlie prolongation of that ·which represents the rise at the moment of slack-icatcr, when the out flow and inflow are iu cquilibrio. If, as is usually the case at the mouth of a river, the obscrYed cmTe is nearly that of the sines for a circle wl10se radius is half the range of the tide, reclamation is possible if the floOll-cnrrent begins to run up within one hour and forty-three minutes after the time of low water. If slack-water occurs at the instant of low water stand, drainage of the marsh to a depth equal to the range of the tide is practicable; but if the flood-current does not commence to run up until one hour forty-three minutes after low water, the fresh-water accurnnlatiou, while the sluice-g·ates are closed, will equal the range of the tide .· Fig.'.!, of Plate :Xo. '.!I, illustrates these two cases. Care must be exercised in the application of this rule in certain cases: 1st. When the strram has a transyersc bar rising aboni the plane of low water, the observations used must be those made upon the bar itself. ln the instance where a "submersible" dam exists, the rising eurYe u:-ithin the obstruction resembles that obse1Tcd outside, except that the lower portion to the height of the dam is cut off. If, for instance, tlie da,m is elenited to the height of half tide, no tangent to the tidal curve within will intersect tlie dcscelllling branch, and yet the case may be oue of possible drainage to an adequate depth. In }'ig. 3, I offer curves plotted from simultaneous obser,·ations near Hyannis, :Massachussetts, in which the larger tide is that of the harlJor, aud the smaller that of Dunbar's Salt Pond, which is separated from the harbor by a natural har, considerallly elenited above the plane of low water outsitle, although neYer dry. No fresh-water feeders exist, and drainage to the leyel of the bar is of course possible, although the criterion (misappliecl to these curves) would say not. 2J. This rule is inapplicable, I think, to an inlet commuuicatiug with a great lagoon, because in tllis case, even in the entire abscuce of fresh-water feeders, the current epochs will be late.
PART II.-FIELD-WORK.

At the request of the Massachusetts Board of Harbor Commissioners, you instructed me to examine the marshes and shores of Scituate and Marshfield, to determine the practicability of reclaiming the tide-lands, and to ascertain the probable effects of reclamation upon the 1rnYigable facilities of North and Green Harbor Rivers. In these studies I lia\~e pursued my usual custom of inchlding in my examinations all the features of the coast which properly belong- to a pl1ysical survey, SQ as to make this work a part of our general scheme of a physical ltistory of the seaboard.
GREEN HARBOR RIVER.

This river, so called, is the drain of about fifteen hundred acres of marshes, situated mostly in the township of Marshfield. It receives two considerable tributaries and innumerable brooks and creeks in its meandering course. The lower reach of the river is known as Green Harbor, whose length from Turkey Point to the bar is about seven-eighths of a mile, and whose maximum low-water width scarcely exceeds five hundred feet. A sand-bar obstructs the entrance, upon which there is H. Ex. Doc. 206-12

from two to three feet of water at ordinary low tide; The average rise is nine feet, and vessels can take the grouncl within the harbor at low tide without injury. The shelter from winds and sea is good. As far as I could learn the trade of the place employs but one small vessel, but uuring the summer, many small yachts, for the accommodation of watering people, make here a rendez,-ous. It is not entitled to the slightest consideration as a port of refuge, although wssels have been known to run into it under desperate circumstances. It has been proposed to reclaim the marshes by constructing a transnrse sluice-tlarn at the head (}f the harbor, and I visited the scene during the month of June, with the two-fold object of determining the practicability of this reclamation, and the likelihoolii. of resulting injury to the entrance. The problem of reclamation presented is one of the simplest kind, and I was enabled to reach a positive result from a few experiments and a yery limited suryey; but tlte question of injury to tlte entrance has perplexed me yery much. I silall offer, howeYcr, an argument upon this point. The place chosen for gauging the riYer was near Turkey Point, wilerc the uplands approach the stream on eitller hand, and where a dam could be most economically and effecti\-ely construe.tell The table which follows furnishes the clements for a pro1ile of the section from upland to uplaml, crossing the river at the place of gauging. (See Fig. 4.) The tide was observed for thirteen hours upon the 30th of June. TM range wn8 8.90 feet, whicL is about what I should compute for Cape Cod Bay at the same age of the moon, aml no unusual distortion of the profile could lie detected. 'l'he marshes are at the level of Ligh water in this portion of the basin, and supposing, at the date of our ohservations, gates to haYe been closed upon the rfrer at tlrn time of low water, the accumulation behind them during the following six hours would. have been, according to your criterion, about three feet, so that the surface of the mar&h would haye been six foot above the water-table at time of high water in the bay. This depth of three feet is largely in excess of the fresh-water supplJ·, because mq.ny of the creeks clo not fully discharge tlieir tide,waters during the fall in the main riYer.. Our liydrorneter, at low water, gave a density of 1.0105, indicating that the out-flow was then three-quarters sea-water. Inlleed, the current observations show that the fresh-water discharge was exceedingly small, and that gates of ordinary dimensions may be relied upon for draining this basin perfectly in summer. The river, at its embouchure, flows into tile sea in a course but little to the eastward of south, with rocks upon its left and sands upon its right bank. These sands, driYen by the- waves and the flood-current, are constantly invading the .river's mouth, but are driven back by the out-flow, and the bar is for the most part formed of material from outside, which is left in the debataule district between the opposing forces. I think that it is only during heavy weather that the flood-current, aided by the waves, can overbalance the scour of the ebb, even during dry seasons, when the freshwater outllow is itself too small to be considered, and I base my opinion upon the following considerations: The shifting material is sand, and this is not suspended, but rolled or chfrcn along upon the bottom at a rate far less than that o~ the water itself, so that the progress that it ultimately makes, and the direction it takes, must be determined by the power and direction of the resultant of the forces, precisely as if these forces acted simultaneously. Now, although the flooJ and ebb, at low-river seasons, are essentially the same as regards volume, they are quite unlike as regards ·velocity, i. c., working.power. The yeins and arteries of the marshes are :filled late and drained late as regards the tidal time at the mouth of the river, so that the greatest in-flow is called for when the water is high upon the bar, while the greatest out-flow is so much behindhand as to reach the bar when the latter has but a small section; the former, therefore, creates but little horizontal motion, while the latter creates a rapid current. ·when we consider that the ivork of a stream increases with the square of its velocity, we should not be surprised to fuid the ebb at the mouth of a river playing the dominant part in the excavation of channels. For instance, when the tide at our station haJ risen two feet, or less than one-fifth of its range, the velocity of in-flow was 0.50 feet per i;;econd, but when it had fallen to the same stage, the outflow was 1.40 fi,iet; in other words, the working-power in the same section was eigh.t times as great upon the ebb as it was upon the flood. · If a sluice-dam were to be constructed, shutting out the tides from the marshes, the fresh-water out-flow only would be left to resist the action of the waves, and, as far as I can judge, the summer discharge would be impotent. In the introduction to this report I have pointed out instances of

little llarbors that lta1e been injured by "lreirs and darns like that proposed for Green Hal'bor RiYer and 1 ha-re little doubt that a decline in the depth on the bar will follow t!Je reclamation of th; marshes. It is true that the direction of the embouchure is favorable as regards shelter from the sea, and that the supply of material is not so great as at many other points along shore, but I have abouL made up my mind that in course of time, after the dam is constructed, the inlet will become a "tide harbor,' 1 likfl Scusset and Sandwich, i. e., dry 'at low tide, at least upou its bar.

NORTH RIVER ·

. Dean's History of Scituate, publishell in 1831, fnmishes a brief description of the North River, which I shall quote, not only because as a general sketch it is still sufficient, but also because it comments upon the facilities for ship-building and navigation which the riYer afforded before the recent disastrous inroads of the sea : "This stream received its name before 1633, autl probalJly from the circumstance that its general course is from south to north, or that it was farther north from Plymouth than South Hiver in Marshfield, which meets the Korth Itiver at its mouth. The North River is a n.'ry wiuding stream, fl.owing through extensive marshes, sometimes, as it were, sporting iu the broad meadows in the most fancifnl meanders, and sometimes 8hooting away to the highlands which border the meadows. There is one rea~h which has long been called the 'No Gains,' from the circumstance that, after fl.owing from side to side, and almost turning backward for several times, it has, in fact, flowed several miles and gained but a few l'Ods in its direct progress to the 8ea. From the sea to the North River bridge, on the Plymouth road, an air-line would not exceed scYen mile~, while the line of the river amounts to eighteen miles. The tide rises at the North mver bridg-e from three to five feet, and there is a perceptible tide two miles higher up. It has t.hree chief sources, the Namatakeese . and Indian Head, which flows from the Matakeeset Ponds in Pembroke, and the Drinkwater, which has its sources chiefly in Abington. The tributaries are the three Herring brooks on the Scituate side, and the Two-Mile Brook and tbe &gers' Brook on the Marshfield side." · · * · "Just

helow, aIHl at au air-line distance of a little more than three miles from North RiYer bridge, is Union bridge. A half mile lower, on the Scituate side, is King's Landing, and about half a mile on the same side is Hobart's Landing. Here, we believe, the first ·essels were built, by Samuel House, as early as 1650." * * " * "Here the sliip Columbia (Captain Kendriek) was built by James Brig·gs, A. D. 177:3. It was the first ship that visited the northwest coast from this country. Captain Kendrick explored the riYer Oregon, and named it from the name of his ship, which name will probably preYail l1enceforth. At the distance of another half mile below is Little's hridge, at which point ·,rn 'believe vessels liarn been built 011 the .l\Iarshfield side. The meadows above this station are of Ye»y 'arious width, in few places exceeding a mile; bat below there is a wide expanse of marsh, anciently called the' :Sew Harbor .Marshes.' The scenery here is on a sublime scale when viewe<l from Coleman's Hills, or from the Fourth Cliff. The broad marshes are surrounded by a distant theater of hills, and the river expands and embraces many islands in iti:i bosom. Here it a1lproaches the sra, as if to burst through the beach, but turns almost at right angles to the east, and run,.; parallel with the sea-shore for nearly three miles before it fiods its outlet, lea Ying a beach next the sea for nearly twenty rods in width, composed priucipally of round and polished pehbks, exc<.'ptiug only the Fourth Cliff, a half mile in length, which comprises many acres of excellent arable land. :Kearly a mile above the rirnr's mouth is '\Yhite'R I?erry, where is :i wharf arnl a small village on the Marshfield side. Here vessels have been built, and many that have been built aboYe here rcceirn their rigging. The river's width may be estimated as follows: In ordinary tid('s, at l.IHiou 1.Jridge, seven rods; at Little's bridge, nine rods; it expands below to a half a mile in wirlth, wlwre it is now called Fourth Oliff Bay, and formerly New Harbor; here the channel dh~ides, aud unites again a mile below; a half a mile abow. its month it is fourteen rods iu width. Tlw cb:mnel at its mouth often shifts its plame, owiug to the nature of the sandy bottom and to the Yiolence of the stream and the tides. It seldom affords more than nine feet of water, even when tlwre is but one channel; but it often happens that there am two ch~umels when the water is something less. This fact accounts for the difficultr and expernm of carrying out the vessels built upon this river; and yet only in part, for there are shoals above oYer which vessels of two lrnn11red tom; and upward mul'lt be lifted with gondolas or heaved wiLh kedges- The principal are \\'ills' Shoal, at the upper part of the New Harbor Marshes, aud the Horseshoe Shmtl." Since the abo,-e statement was written forty years have elapsed, during which important physical changes have oceurred, which, in corrnection with other circumstances, liave led to the abandonment of nearly all commercial enterprises uppu tLe North River; aIHl the pl'oject now entertained for reclaiming the marshes, by sluieillg out the ti(k, invoh:es the sacrifi('e of no important interests of navigation. The i11jnries which the channcl-wa;y has suffered have l1ec1111rincipall_y clue to the waveR, which, dmfog Yiolent storms, Jiave burst through the narrow strip of beach that separates the lower reach of the river from the ocean. Appreciating the importance of this natural dike in connection with the pr~je.cted r~clamation, I devoted some time to itR inspection, with a Yiew to pointing out its weak places. With the exception of Fomth Oliff, which appears to be the smaller portion of a Ligh hill, once extending into the sea, the entire beach is but a windrow of sand and stones cast up by the waves and subsequently modified in part by the winds, differing only in matters of detail from the littoral cordon of our Southern States. Shingle-lci·ees.-A portion of this beach is permanent, the forces which created it having, as it would seem, ultimated their effects. I refer here to the shingle-levee, which, from the point where the stream "approaches the sea as if to break through,'' extends like a· strong bulwark half way t-0 the river's mouth, interrupted only by Fourth Cliff, from whose waste a portion of the material of the levee seems to have been selected. It is not impossible that the river once found its outlet between the Third and Fourth Cliffs, as most of the people living in the neighborhood conceive. Instances are numerous where streams have been turned aside, and sometimes cut off from the sea, by the advance of shingle. · Shingle-levees appear to me to be worthy of careful study, because they are the best natural measures of the power of storm-waves, and I have made the dimensions of this.one at Scituate a special subject, in order to ascertain to what height the dikes, required farther down the beach, must lie carried in order to pre,ent the overflows that now frequently occur.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

For the h.eight of the aboYe mean section Calarn:Fs dike formula would give a fore slope of 4: 1; but, as the table shows, the inclination Yaries from a maximum of 3: 1 to a mean of 5: 1 for our natural dike. In the grand <like of Petten, (North Hollanu,) which is still in course of c-0nstruction, the mean slope is(): 1 ; but I find from my notes made upon the spot in lSGS that for the storm-belt, covered with hasalt blocks, the slopes are 5: 1 and 3: 1; so that the work of SCYt:'ral cc·nturies begins to approach the economy of nature. The leeward slope of our Jeycc, for different sectious, i::; Yery llt:'arly the same from point to point except near the base, where it is affected by different elerntious of the rinr-bed upon which it lies, It is iirobably the cun-e of least resistance for the material employed. It sometimes approximatef! quite clo::;ely the c;ycloid, and it alwa;p5 has an aproning to protect the base. If it were steeper, the fall of overflowing water woLLld excan1ic the marsh at ibc foot aud endanger the whole structure; if it were less inclined, there wonhl not only 1w a waste of material, but, in the eycnt of a rapid succession of overlenping sr;rn, the accmnu1ated waters might n·act aml burst through the crest. 1\Iy assistant, :\Ir. ILL. :\Iarindin, has recently examined the lene near Chelsea, 1Uassaclmsctts, the southern portion of which is more exposed to the sea, and therefore the highest, reaching an extreme cleYation of 14.13 feet abo\·e mean bigh ·water. The fore slope of this portion has an average inclination of J: 1, and au extreme uear the crest of 2~: 1. The ex11osure is only to the southeasterly quadrant, and the shallow tlats, which extend a long 1rny to tbe seaward, break the force of the ::;ea. The lougitudinal profile of this levee shows a decline of height as the obserrnr moves to the northward, reducing the augle of exposurcr and falling under the shelter of Xahant. Thifl )pyec lrns a rear slope of 3: 1 abo\'e the apron. Ilelo1· I<'ourth Cliff the shing1e-levee continues 'lor a considerable distance, hut gradual!~' loses its distinctiYe character, and merges with the sands, which seem to have preceded all other material in the march soutlnrn1·u. In the year lSJ:J the communities about the ~ortl1 Uiver attempted to cut a new ontlot in tltis portion of the heacli, using aL ilrst harnl-labor, but ultimately e1hploying a dredging-machine. The bottom was remoYed to a depth of six feet below the marsh leye1, but not to the low water of the sr!fl. f1ontrary to expectation, the water, instead of ilowing seaward, rnshell in towarll the ril-er, Fourth Cliff Bay beiug at times, as we find. from our observations, below the high water of the sea. The influx was nry strong, but ro:ecmed quite powerless to enlarge or deepen the trench through the firm and nndnous l'Oi1 of tlie marsh; to use the expression of the workmen, "the stream ·wouldn't gull." HeaY.Y weather came on soon after the work of the dredging-machine ceaRed, ancl the waves drorn in masses of saml and stones, which soon chokeu up the pass. In course of time ~t shinglo-1&.«~e formed. across the inlet, and rose to the height of 10 feet above the high-water plane of the sea. I gi re a section of tliis new formation, in which 110 LleciLled berms appear. ·

I glean one very curious fact from those employed in opening this channel, Yiz, the original bank of shingle was found to extend downward only to the snrface of the marsh, which was not sensibly depressed beneath its weight. I infer that, as Fourth Cliff wears awa;v, the whole beach falls back, and the-present banks of sand and shingle are really superimposed upon ancient meadow lands or river channels. The marshes are not floating bogs like the koogs of Denmark, or liable to slump down aft.er inclosure, like the polders of Holland. The newly formed levee, across the mouth of the artificial outlet, exerts a pressure of over twelve hundred pounds to the square foot upon the marsh beneath its crest, and the weight of the original bank, as far as I can judge, was over seventeen hundred pounds to the square foot uuuer the crest. I have allowed in these estimates 25 per cent. for voids. Old rubble breakwaters that have been shaken down by the waves to a state of repose occupy still a space 25 to 30 per cent. greater than the rock in situ. Some shrinkage will no doubt take place after drainage is effected, but this will not, I think, exceed 10 to 12 per cent. If the water-table is dropped four feet I shall expect the marsh surface to sink about six inches. Sand-beach.-Frrrther down the Scituate Beach the stones gradually give place to sand, and the shore no longer reflects the action of the sea alone, but is diversified by dunes blown up by the winds. There are occasional points where traces of overflow appear, and I give the section of one of the slue-ways formed by the Minot's gale, and traversed b,v the sea at least once a year since that memorable storm:

·=7.06 above mean high water of tea.

The maximum height of this slue-way is ~even feet; this may be regarded as the measure for annual overflow, especially as I find the same measure on other parts of the New England coast. I have given in Fig. 10 a profile, plotted from the preceding table, because it illustrates so well the double action in ovcrfiow, the violent dash against the seaward face, and the flowing down on the opposite slope. On sandy shores, a mound thrown up by the sea can nearly always be distinguished from one due to the wind ; in the former the steeper slope is seauiards, in the latter leeward, so that an overflow reverses the order of the slopes found in a dune. Sections which I have einoe run across the '' Haalover," at the head of Nantucket Harbor, and those through the slues 11f Ootamy Beach, at the liead of Edgartown 'Barbor, give the same general curve with the nme ma.ximnm elevation witkin siaJ inches. In running water (in the bed of a river for instance) the sands take the form of tlat dunes, which correspond in the order of their slopes with those on

land.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

General rise.-The mean-level rises during storms from sea.ward, and this must always be taken int.cl accmint in projects for dikes and dams. This general rise can best be measured by observing the height of the water's surface in sheltered coves and harbors. Major Graham's report on Cape Cod Harbor shows, from titlal observations between 1833 and 1835, that a twenty-four hours' gale from the southeast (i.e., directly into Massachusetts Bay) causes a general rise of 3.33 feet. The coping of the United States dry-dock at Charlestown was designed to be above the highest tide, and was placed 4.69 feet above mean high water. The sea has actually risen 0.4 above the top of this coping once during the past twenty years. If we grant that the storm-rise is affected by the configuration of a harbor or bay in no greater degree than the ordinary tide, we must apply a correction to the dry-dock rise of nearly 10 per cent. in order to reduce it to its proper :proportion for the outi;ide coast. \<v e ban~ then four and a half feet for the general rise during violent storms. I do not think it necessary t-0 go back more than twenty years in estimating the height to which the sea is likely to rise, because there is no economy in providing for contingencies which do not present themselves more than once in a life-time. In Holland, where the lives of thousands depend upon the security of the dikes, the works are only provided for ten feet general rise, although the tradition of the Cirnbrian :flood is over forty, and the Deluge greater yet. Dean's History mentions that the sea has been known to :flow over the isthmus wbicl1 divides Scituate Harbor from the North River, and I am informed that during the l\Iinot's gale the rush over this pince was so great as t-0 Bweep away fences, &c. I have not time to run a line of levels o\·er this isthmus, which I regret, because I think it would ha\"e given an ·excellent measure for "general rise." The overflow in the Minot's gale, to which I have just referred, injured the lands to such an extent that it was not until the third season after that the English grass recovered its former luxuriance.

The beach should be protected against a fourteen feet run of the sea. We have found between the Fourth Cliff and the South River junction only five slues which fall below this standard height, and these we have sectioned. The point of the beach near the North River is generally low for twelve hundred feet, but will afford, I think, no source of trouble for many years. The interior dams must be at least three and a half feet, but need not (if perfectly shelter.ed) exceed four and a half feet above the mean high-water plane. of the sea to escape overflow from the "general rise'' during storms. The bench of our survey is situated on the right bank of the river, nearly opposite Slanting- Spar. It is within a circle cut upon the highest point of a boulder, which boulder may be distinguished from other rocks by its having an iron ring-bolt on one side. This bench is 1-23 feet above mean high water of the sea, (as computed.) Mouth of river.-During the last century the river mouth has been forced to the southward by the advance of the beach a distance of nearly one mile, and, since our survey of 1858, about one thousand feet. A beach of small shingle now stretches from the coast south of the embouchure, and overlaps the beach of which I have been speaking, so that the river makes a sharp turn just before issuing- upon the sea. Between the mouth of the river and White's Ferry the stream has been injured by overflows from the sea, whicl1 have not only rendered the channel more shallow but made it narrower than formerly, the material of the beach being much cif it too heavy for the ebb-current to remove, and the opposite bank of the stream too firm to yield in due proportion. 4 The shoalest place in the river is in the vicinity of the slue-way of which we have given the section in Fig. 10. It is encumbered with banks, and the average depth of a pathway one hundred feet wide, along the line of greatest depression, is only five feet in ordinary high water. Tradition says that nearly a century ago the mouth of the river was at this point, and that since tae river moved on there have remained here impediments t.c> navigation. However this may be, the Minot's gale reopened a tnwk over the beach, and poured into the stream a mass of gravel

and shingle that com1lleted the ruin of the river as far as navigation is concerned. We have made a close survey of this portion af the stream, and deposited a chart of it at the office, bearing the names of the observers. Tides.-Dean's History, as we have seen, gives ''three to five feet" as the rise and fall of ·the tide at North River Bridge forty years ago, and I am inclined to accept the statement, not only because the author is reputed to be careful in such matters, but also because the recollections of Captain Tolman and other persons in this very intelligent neighborhood confirm it. In the present obstructed condition of the rivers, the range of tide at North River Bridge varies from 0.8 to 1.5 feet, and the range does not now exceed these figures at any point abo-.e ·white's Ferr_y, near which the modern oYerfiows have occurred. The obstructions act as weirs, over which only the upper portion of the tide flows. The highest place in the river bed along the thread of the channel is 1.60 feet belo'Y the mean level of the sea, and upon this weir the tide does not rise to the hig·h·water level of the ocean, because of the rush into the reservoir beyond, which does not get filled in the short time allowed. The following table exhibits the times and heights of a low neap tide:

The obstructions in the lower reach of the riYer do not protect the marshes from an inundation on the occasion of a gTeat general rise out&ide, because, after the river mounts two or three feet above ordinary high water, its section becomes very ample all the way from the sea. But the obstructions play their part in preventing the prompt relief from inundation, since, with the subsidence of the general rise outside, the sections at the obstructions return to their ordinary dimensions and the outlet is choked. What is true of inundations due to "general rise," is also, in a measure, true of every spring tide. The high-water volumes 1low easily up the rirnr into the Fourth Oliff Bay, but are so delayed that when they would return to the sea t1..iey find that the fall of the tide has left but a'contracted section in the lower reach of the stream, and, although this becomes the scene of a torrent during the low stages of the outside tide, the relief is not afforded for 'several days. It is especially at the season of hay-cutting on these meadows that the prolonged inundations become injurious ; and Captain Tolman informs me that an increase in their durations has been observed and much commented upon by persons whose memories go back to better times. · Of course the order of the tidal currents is very much affect~d by the tendency of the obstructions to limit the supply of tide-water in the reservoirs during the rise, and pond it back during tlfe fall. The flood current, although it does not begin to ruu in over the shoals until it. Jacks but about two hou~s and a half of high water, continues· about one hour and a half after the tide has begun to sink. The ebb current continues about eight hours, and runs most rapidly about the time it is low water in the sea. You will perceive that the flood and ebb, the one pouring in at high water, the other struggling out at low water, cannot be properly compared by their durations alone, but their volumes must be considered since the sections are unlike. Here is a case where "Profesl'or Peirce's criterion" is not applicable for obvious reasons, and it be~orues necessary to comput.e the

t The height of surface is referred to low water, (4. 6 below "Primary Bench.")

Effect of a dam.-I<'rom the abo-ve table the rin~r discharge may be computed to be 11,871,100 cubic feet during six hours, and this quantity includes any reservation from the preceding higher tides. Now the area of the ri-ver surface above the gauging place, and below the North River Dam, is 32,920,470 square feet, exclusive of tributaries and creeks. If, upon the day of gauging, a clam had been thrown across the stream, the average r.ise of the river behind it would have been 0.36 of a foot in six how·s. As the area of the river surface would be reduced by drainage, the average rise, under otherwise similar circumstances, would be slightly augmented. The figures I have given are true for the period of my observations, but of course vary with the rain-fall at different seasons. My acquaintance with the riv1:r ll: too short to permit me even to conjectnre upon what date in the spring the river becomes drain able. On September 29, just before the beginning of the rains, after the long drought of the past season, my aid, :Mr. F. H. North, ganged the river again at Little's.Bridge, at the head of Fourth Cliff Bay, and found the flood and ebb cunents of nearly equal durati-011, and the density of the water as high as 1.017 on the last of the ebb. In effect the stream had become an arm of the sea, without. any perceptible rise due to fresh water. During the coming winter and spring opportunities will be offereq for examining the eonditions of the river under the circumstances most C>pposed to drainage, and I suggest to the marsh OWD.el'S an occasional repetition of some of the observations I have detailed in this report, that the whole scheme may be reduced t-0 figures, and not a dollar spent that can be saved, or saved at tlle eJ;pense of success. The removal of the shoals from the lower reach of the river is the obvious remedy for all dial· culties of discharge, but the depch to which the dredging should be carried ought not to be.decided upon before observations in the wet season a.re niade. Deepening to the level of mean low water of the sea will be the utmost tbat can become necessary, and I hope that something even may 'be saved of this. In addition t-0 the observations which. furm the basis of the ti!fe table gi veu above, we have half. hourly records of the riE.e and :t'all at stations simultaneously occupied, so that we can follow aU the tidal phases from the sea to the North River Dam. I am obliged to omit, however, these detailil,

because they are too >oluminous for tliis report, an<l would require loug c:splauatious, hut I shall venture to comment upon them briefly, to sliow their practical Learing upon the eugiueer',; project. I conceive that the engineer, in deciding upon the dimensions of his sluiee·g·ates, may ii1Hl it necessary t-0 compute the >ariatious of the slope, aud a stndy of U1e progress of the tidal i1hase:s will be his best resource.* A gate dosed upon a stn·am produces an pJfo<:t like that of thl' ri;;i11g tide at slack water, and the ri8e dne to the closure is propagatetl at tLe :sarne rate (P:ssentia1ly) a,.; that of tlie tide. In a similar way, the dt·pressiou caust'd by the opt.·11i11g of a sluiet>·gate falls back like the tide. vVith the Nortlt Hiver at the level we found it, the rise on the dmmre auu the foll on the opening of a sluice-gate at 'Yhite's FL"iTy would aftect Fourth Uiiff Ba~- in aliont one lwnr, the neighborhood of I.iittlc\; Bridg·t' in out- hour and tiJty-eight miuntt·s, aud tlit; ucigliliurhootl (If North River Dam in two llours and forty-six miunte,.;.

Tl!e crest of the leYee, as far as section 4 and bl'yonll, appears very even, the irregularities heing due to tlrn different heigl!ts of the blocks composing it. Between sections 4 and 5 tl!e beach, so to speak, emls ver_y abruptly at a poiut about twenty feet from section 4, and six lmnllred anll twenty fret west of crosi:;-i:;ect.iou 1."

"For a length of two lmmlred feet from the foot of Bayley's Hill, the profile of the crest of the. levee shows a series of pretty uniform depressions and elevations. The direction of these depressions or slues is not 11oruml to tlle crest, but approaclles parallelism with the line of greatest exposure. "'l'he ltwee, as near as I could judge, nm8 iu a northerly and southerly direction at ·this point, while the depressions seem to lie nearly southeast aml north wesL ,; I have measured two of the largest blocks found on tl!e levee, one on the crest near crosssection 5, at a height of 6.8 feet abo\·e niean high water of the. sea. F1'om a rough calculation this block contains somewhat over three thousand cubic inches. The other was half way up the fore slope, between sections 4 anti u, about five feet a!Jove mean high water; it contains five thou· Rand cubic inches. "A heuch-nmrk \nlS Pstablished 011 the apex of a boulder insidP of the stont>-wall in rt>ar of cross-section No. 3. The boulder is couical, aml lms the letters C.

"'I give in 8ectiou No. 7 a transyer8e section of a shingle-mound betwel'u Bass l'oint and Bayley's 11ill. This mound was thrown up hy the waves between two rocky ledges which extend some distance iuto the sea; these limit the length of the levee to. nearlj~ one hundred and fifty feet. The height increases from l'itber end toward the center, where tht> measnrernenfa of the crosssection girn a height of 16.57 feet. above mean high water of the sea. The shingle is similar in sizn :mil shape to that found at section No. 1 on Pond Beach. No large irregular blocks are seen OJJ this len·r, nlthough the at~joining shorr::; are rocky, and ledges extend into the sea at different points." In a not(~ received as this report goes to preRs, Professor Agassiz says : " 'l'he evidence of the very rreent origin of a portion of the shingle-levee at Nahant is as plain and direct as you can wish it; for the larger fragmeut.s of rock anll smaller materials of which it comdsts, rest upon a stone--wall built to support a road leading to Bass Point. Tllis wall was not built earlier than 1817. That part of the levee which covers the stone-wall and road lea11s westwardly upon Bass Point, ancl eastwardly merges with the levee that extends all along the cove." ·
·The miuimmn height of the levee is at a point 817 feet west of cross-section 1, G.47 feet above mean high water; the material is angul:tr blocks.

REPOHT ON THE CONNECTIOX OF THE PHDIARY RASE LIS"ES ON KENT ISLAND, lVIARYJ,AND, AND ON CltAXEY ISLAND, YIHGINIA, AND ON THE DEGREE OF ACCURACY OF THE INTEUYENING PRilVIARY AND SGB-I'HDIARY TRIANGT.JLATIONS.
PREPARED I::'\ l\fAY,

1871, IlY CHARLES A.

SCHOTT, AssrnTA::'IT, COA8T Sn?YEY.

The Craney Island Yerification bast· was measured in September, 18G9; a detailed aeconHt of

it, together with the resulting length, was reported under date of April 15, 1870. The triangulation
between the two bases may be conceived as compose1l of two parts, foe upper oul:', designated Part ''VII," extending from the line South base l\:ent Island-l\farriott to tile line Costin-Back In,·er Light; and tlle lower one, designated Part "YIII/' connecting· tlw last-11amed li1w. tlmrngh a series of smaller triangles, with the »crifieation base. The distance between tlrn middle of the base lines, when measured through the axis of the triangulation, is one hundred and fifty-sewn statute miles. The conditions of the triangulation, iuclusfre of the correspondence of the basr lines, were Ratisfied b,Y application of tlii; method of least squares, as gm1erally explained in former reportR on thc primary tria11gnlatio11 bet.ln·en }faine anu the Territory of Columbia. The results of Part VI of immediately precruing operntion,;; an' gin·n iu Coast SmTf'Y Rt'port for 1866, Appendix No. 8. The line Costin-Back Hiver Light waR taken as the junction-li1w of Parts YII and VIII; it is distant from the Ura1wy Island base :1 bout twenty-fin\ statute miles. After a long intern1l, operations were resumed in 18Qtj at the juuction-line, and the triangulation complcw<l in 136!). Between South base Kent falarnl aml tlrn jnnctio11 tliere are thi:t't,y-six triangles, measured between 1846 and 1853 by Assistant E. Illunt; the angles were measured hy repetitions, chiefly b,r means of a 12-incb Simms tlleodolite, (Xo. 11.) Between the junction and Craney Island there arP twenty-one triangles, measured lwtwccn 1866 and 186!1 by Assistants R. D. Cutts and R E. Halter;" all angles worn measured by repetitions, and the greatei· munber by a 1:!-iueh Gambey theodolite, (No. 3:!.) The conditions among the augular spaces measured at each station were first satisfied, and ihe probable error of each resulting direction was computed, as in Part VI, hy t!w method used for directions, the separate results haying been properls arranged for this purpose. In the older operation, a station near Back Ri\'Cr Light was used; bnt in resuming the work, its position was carefully transferred, both hy angular and linear measures, to the center of the lighthouse. The necessary adjustment of this auxiliary work was attended to. The accompanying sketcheR show the triangulation of Parts VII and VIII, also of tlle sub-primary stations Cape Charles Hgbt and North end of measurement, and of the secondary station Hampton Seminary. It will he seen that the tlirection Costin to Xew Point Comfort has been rejected by the computer; it was founcl several seconds in error, clue to an insufficient number of observations.

The logarithmic constant in the lcngth-eqnation for PM·t VII, in order to prodnce this weighted mean, is therefore -18·3, (nnits of the 7th place of decimals;) and for Part VIII, +23.3. \Vith this additioual equation,* the number of normal equations in Part VII became 35, and that of Part YIII ~3, a111l their solution and the substitution of resulting corrections to the direc· tions prodncetl an exact agreement hetween the base Jines. It will thus be seen that, for any giwn dista11ee in the triaugnlation between Maine and Virginia,, we shall get the same value, no matter from which of the fi.\'e 111ea8nred bases we start. These base lines, when transferred by means of their rel'<pectirn branches of triangulation to a centrally.located line, for which the Fire Island llase was chosen. compared ftS follows befote the four length-equations involvetl had been introduced:

.Fonr different kinds of apparatus were employed in the measures, that of the bases of 1844 being the same. 1405\Jm corresponds to 8.7± statute miles. The efff'ct of the introduction of the length-equation amounts, in Part VII, when greµ,test, to only ON.OM in an angle, and in Part VIII to 011 .124. · The probab_le error of the measure of the Kent Island base is its ns1troo part; that of the starting-line South end Kent Island base-Marriott, its~' (corresponding to om.121 in length ;t) that of the line Costin-Back River Light its '91ioiH and that of the mea-sure of the Craney :Island base its us1ooo part; hence the aYerage probable error of the triangulation between Kent Island and Back River Light is its :l:rr;(000 part, between Ba~k River Light and Craney Island its ±niooo part, and the a-verage probable error of the whole triangulation lying between the base lines of Section III its ::±:: rn1voo part. This last uncertainty. corresponds to nearly ± 0.52 inch to the mile. From the nature of the case these numbers can only be regarded as tolerable approximations.
·It has 79 terms in Part VII, and 27 terms in Part VIII. ~ is given in Colll!t Survey Report of 18661 page 50. The above value has been preferred l\ftcr a re-<li~cussion.

In Part VIII many of the triangles are quite small, and a greater residual in the closing of such triangles is allowable. In this part, also, the measures, on the anrage, appear too great, contrary to previous experience with repeaters, but the defect seems to 1lPpe111l mainly upon thr constructfon of the clamp and the firmness of the instrument. If we deduct the probable observing error of a direction at each station, wbid1 i,.; ±0".::ll! in Part VII, and ±0".193 in Part VIII, from the prollable error of a direction derin~d from tlle closing of the triangles, we find the following triangle com binatiou error: ~ d for Part VII = ± 0".409, aud for Part VIII = ± 0".G50. · In detfmniniug the relatiYe weights to each direction, as required in establishing the conditional equations, the square of this quantity e d was added to the square of the probable ohserv!ng error specially found for any particular direction, thus equalizing, in a great measure, the relative weights of the various directions. The extreme weights are in proportion of 1 to 2.4- in Part vrr, and in the proportion of 1 to 1.6 in Paii. VIII. The final corrections to the observed directions, as demanded by the least square adjustment of the geometrical figure of the triangulation, are gi\·en below.

The average length of a triangle side of Part VIIt is 13.3 statute miles, and of Part YIIIi 9.0 statute miles, and the snlll total of the sides is G78 miles and 225 milt>s respectively. The table of ohserved and corrected angles and of the resulting distances is arranged the same as for the preceding primary triangulation; the unit of length is the con~mittce meter, for the length "of which see the comparisons at Paris in 1867, (Coast Surn~- Report of 1867~ .Appen11ix No. 7.)

APPENDIX No. 7.
LOCAL DEFLECTIONS OF THE ZENITH IN TIIE VICINITY OF WASHINGTON CITY. REPORTED FEBRUARY 9, 1870, BY CHARLES A. SCHOTT, ASSISTANT, COAST SURVEY.

The following results of deflections of the direction of gra,it,r in the 'icinity of the District of Columbia arc respectfully submittccl: The comparatively large number of astl'onornical stations clustered in the vicinity of Washington appeared to me to make it desirable to compare the astronomical and geodetic results, with a yiew of ascertaining the amount and direction of the deflection of the plumb-line at these stations. The astronomical results had previously been re\·ised, and the following tables contain the comparisons in latitude, in azimuth, and in longitude. The probable errors given are those resulting -immediate.ly from the astronomical operations, and are undoubtedly too small; they are affected with constant errors to some extent, the zenithtelescope latitudes, for instance, giving, in some cases, slightly greater results for the smaller zimith distances, and the zenith-sector latitudes giving a small but sensible difference between results from north and south stars. The second line of probable errors in the azimuthal comparisons take in the additional uncertainty of the horizontal angles connecting the mark with the triangulation, but not the accumulated errors depending upon the triangulation. The probable error of the telegraphic-longitude results is only approximately known. The geodetic results, in all cases, are those of the final lea-;t square adjustment of the pri!nary triangulation. The geodetic latitude is the mean of twenty latitudes, measured in Sections I and II, between Cooper (So=i5°) and Sandford (So=Hi 0 ). The geodetic azimuth is the mean of twentyfive azimuths, measured in the same sections, between Howard (A=67i 0 ) and West Hills (J-=73~c). The geodetic longitude is that of Cambridge obtained by means of the Atlantic telegraph. The column headed A-G contains the differences of the astronomical and geodetic results, and the last column, headed ..A.-G', contains the difference of the astronomical and geodetic resultf' after the latter have been changed to make.;" (A-G)=O, antl to that extent the following resulti:; for deflection of plumb-line are relative only. In the last two columns of the latitmle comparisons, a + sign indicates a deflection of the zenith to the northward (of the normal or regular zenith, as depending on Bessel's ellipsoid); in the last two columns of the azimuth comparisons, a + sign indicates a deflection of the meridian to the eastward; and iu the last two columns of the longitude comparisons, a + sign indicates a deflection of the zenith to the westward.

A general deflection of the plumb-line to the westward (zenith east) in the vicinity of the District might be accounted for by the attraction of the Allegha/i ~ nies and the deficiency in attraction of the ocean, if the case in Section I TT . ) were not of an analogous character; we must therefore look upon it as a \ !

A. Lindenkohl, sliowing tile hypsometrieal features by contour-lines 100 feet apart. On this chart the deflection of the vertical is shown in proportional scale, the disturbed zenith being marked by a small ring, and the dottd line connecting it and the station in<li<"ates the amount and direction of the disturbance.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 8.
REPORTS OF OBSERVATIO:\TS OF THE ECLIPSE OF THE SUN ON AUGUST 7, 1869, MADE BY PARTIES OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY, AT THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPAL STATIONS: BRISTOL, TENNESSEE, IN CHARGE OF ASSISTANT R. D. CUTTS; SHELBYVILLE, KENTUCKY, IN CHARGE OF PROFESSOR J. W lNLOCK .AND ASSISTANT G. W. DEAN; SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, IN CHARGE OF ASSISTANT C. A. SCHOTT, UNDER THE IMMEDIATE DIRECTION OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SURVEY; DES MOINES, IOWA, IN CHARGE OF ASSISTANT J. E. HILGARD; AND KOHKLUX, CHILKAHT RIVER, ALASKA, rn CHARGE OF ASSISTANT G. DAVIDSON. ILLUSTRATED BY WOOD-CL'TS AND PLATES No;;. 24, 25, AND 2fi.

«ENERAL PATH Oli' THE EOLIPSE.-(Sketeh Ko. 24.)

The large sketch shows the central line of the eclipse and the limiting lines of totality in the United States, the same things being shown for Alaska in the small sketch in the corner. These maps also show the oval outline of the instantaneous shadow of the moon at every successive minute of Washington mean time. These ovals are drawn by a graphical method devised by M:r. O. S. Peirce, which is explained in the account of the observations of the eclipse published in the Annals of the Observatory of Harvard College. The object of the map must not be mistaken. It is not intended to show the precise latitude and longitude at which the eclipse lasts for two minutes, one minute, or is instantaneous, although it will answer this purpose approximately. But the particular use which it is meant to serve is to predict the times of contact at any given place with sufficient accuracy to afford a judgment as to the relative advantages of two posts of observation, and also to give warning to the observer of the beginning and end of the eclipse. It is highly desirable, before ,rn eclipse, to haYe a means of multiplying such predictions without loss of time, especially when the geographical positions are not well determined at the outset, and are successively improved before the final decision in regard to a station for observation is made. In order to use such a map, it is only necessary to lay down a graduated scale upon the line pasRing through the given geographical position from. the moon's shadow for one minute to the moon's shadow for the next, parallel to the line of central eclipse between those minutes; and to measure the distance on the map between the two shadows, as well as the distance from the shadow at the preceding of the two minutes to the geographical position. Then the ratio of the latter distance to the former is equal to the ratio in which the instant of contact at that place divides the interYal between the two successfre minutes. As an example, let it be required to find the time of the beginning and end of the totality for the point defined by longitude=10°, latitude=39°. This point lies outside of an oval the center of which is marked 5h 57m, and inside of an oval the center of which is marked 5~ {)gm; also inside an oval the center of which is marked 6h oom, and outside one whose center is marked 6h Olm. The totality, therefore, begins at this point betweeu 5h 57m and 5h 5Sm, and ends at 611 oom and 6h 01"'. Then, first placing the scale parallel to the central line from 51' 57m to 5h 58m, and so that the point is on the edge of it, we measure tlie distance from the preceding side of the shadow for the first minute to the preceding side of that for the second minute, and also the distance from the shadow to the first iustant to the point. These distances are 0.84 inch aucl 0.52 inch, and therefore the time of first internal contact is 5h 57Hru, or 5h 57m 37·. Next placing the scale parallel to the eentralline from 6b com to 6h 01m, and so as to run through the point, we me'aSure the distance from the following side of the shadow for the former minute to the following side of the shadow for the latter minute, and also the distance from the former shadow to the point. These distances are 0.95 inch and 0.22 inch, and therefore the time of last internal contact is 6h oonm, or 6h oom 14·. In this way the duration of totality can generally be determined to the nearest second except for points very near the limits.

O.BSEHY ATIONS .AT BRISTOL, TEN}.'"ESSEE. W .ASHINGTo~, August 19, 1869. Sm : I respectfully submit the following report of the operations and results of the party under my charge, in execution of your instructions to observe the solar eclipse of August 7, at some p:iint in the mountains of Southwestern Virginia, where they would be crossed hy the central line of the eclipse. (See Plate No. 24). On the 25th of July, the party reached Bristol, which, according to the most authentic maps, was in close vicinity to the line of greatest obscuration; and 011 the 26th a11d 2ith prelimi11ary observations were taken to ascertain whether the position of the town was correctly laid down. The results being of a satisfactory character, a site for an observatory and for observing the eclipse was selected; the building was put up; and, between the 28th of ,f uly and the 5th of August, the latitude and longitude of the station were determined, the former liy twelve pairs of stars, and the latter by the transmission of time-signals to the Naval Observatory, at Washington, on the nights of the 29th and 31st. A third determination of the difference of longitude between the two places was secured on the night following the eclipse. For the details of this operation reference is made to the report of Assistant A. T. Mosman. Bristol is situated between the Cumberland and Alleghany Mountains, on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, anu immediately on the boundary line, as at present recognized, between Virginia-and Tennessee. It may be said to comprise two separate towns-Bristol, in Tennessee, and Goodson, in Virginia; the main street, which alone separates the two, being laid out along the line of the State-boundary. The obsen'atory was erected on a bare ridge lying to the westward of and adjoining Goodson, about one-third of a mile from the telegraph-office, 320 yards north of the State-line, 82 feet above the railroad-track, and 1,760 feet above the sea. An unobstructed view to t,he westward was obtained, and sufficient ele\-ation to command an extensh-e \'iew of the surrounuiug country and mountains. (See Plate 25, Fig. 1, showing the vicinity of the station.) The zenith-telescope and transit were mounted on solid piers, composed of brick and cement. Tlte times of the c1>mmencement and tlie end of the eclipse and of the total phase were computed for the latitude and longitude of the obsen·atory, as approximately determi11ed by the 3d of August, using the formulre and tables contained in the "Supplement to the American Ephemeris for 1869." The final reduction of all the observations and comparisons decreased the approximate latitude b~1" .6 and increased the longitude by o· .25. A programme of "what to observe" was prepared and arranged iu the order in which the phenomena would occur, and special classes assigned to each observer. As the party was small and organized almost entirely for what may be termed precision or time observations, many of the physical phenomena, usually observed on_such occasions, although included in the llrogramme and more fully explained to those who volunteered or desired to observe them, were not intended to be specially observed, on the ground that, if too much duty was imposed on any one observer, noue might be thoroughly performed. Hence, the examination of the sun's disk, its colors and spots, during the different phases of the eclipse, the colors exhibited by the corona, the degree of darkness during totality, and the changes and gradations in the coloring of the landscape before and after totalit;r, the effect of the obscuration n11on animals, &c., were omitted or only incidentally observed, for the reason that they could not be properly or reliably attended to without interfering with a more desirable class of observations. On thA afternoon of the 6th of August, the telescopes were placed temporarily in position, and ~very possible preparation made to secure success in the observations to be taken on the next day. August 7, 1869.-The telescope used by me was zenith-telescope No. 2, made by Troughton & Simms. It was mounted on the brick pier on which it had been employed in the determination of the latitude; the observatory having been so built that its western end might be re~oved for observing the eclipse. fie object-glass was 31 inches in diameter, the focal length 54 incb~s, and the amplifying-power about 28. Box-chronometer Hutton No. 215, running to mean time, was placed close by, and the times, as called by me, were noted and recorded hy J\fr. F. W. Perkins, of the United States Coast Survey. The telescope employed by Assistant A. T. ~fosman was reconnoitering-tele:-;cope ~o. H,

118

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDE:NT OF

United States Coast Survey, having an aperture of 3 inches, a focal length of 34 inches, and an amplifying-power of 40. It was placed just outside the obserrntory, at its southwest corner, in order to be protected from the northeast wind, which was blowing in puffs a short time before the commencement of the eclipse. Mr. Mosman recorded bis own time, usi11g sidereal chronometer Hutton No. 20i. The telescopes were fitted with eye-pieces for direct vision, and provided with diaphragms in which the circle was divided into octants for the approximate determination of positions of contacts and of spots on the sun. The time was obtained hy transits taken on the evenings of the Gth aml 7th of August. About an hour previous to the commencement of the eclipse, the lliffor·cnt groups of spots 011 the sun were plotted on large pasteboard circles uivided into octants, and were then lettered so as to secure identity in designation when noting the times of their immersion and emersion. Bach observer was provided with one of these circles on which to sketch and record the position and appearance of the different phenomena observed. (See Plate No. 25, Fig. 2.) During the entire partial eclipse the sun shone with great splendor, so much so 'tlmt it wa.s necessary to use the darkest screen-glass, which, in my case, was of a deep-red color. Just before the last contact, however, when the rays appeared to be fainter, ;i lighter shade of red was substituted. During totality the screen was removed. 4° 2om.-At this time cumuli clouds, lying principally along the horizon, covered about threetenths of the sky. The wind was east-northeast, in puffs of moderate strength, say from 1 to 4. The atmosphere was remarkably clear and steady; the trees on the summits of the Alleghan~· Mountains, lying sixteen miles to the southeast, being readily distinguished by the bare eye.

The computed times given above were deduced from the results of the final computations of the observations for latitude and longitude. These results show that the position of the obser-va· tory was about four miles to the northward of the central line of the eclipse as pr~jedeu according to the data supplied by the " Supplement to the American Ephemeris." 4h 43m 52·.6.-Not the slightest sign of the presence or approach of the moon was observed before the contact took place. This may have been due, however, to the dark screen-glass employed. Nor was the sharp line of the sun's limb in any manner affected by the approach of the moon, or at the time of contact. Looking intently at the position-angle computed for the contact, the slightest possible change was observed to be taking place at a point in the.rSun's outline, and the time called, though I was uncertain" at the moment whether I was correct or not.

The following notes were made by me during the interrnls between the immersion of the spots: 4h 5Gm.-Five perceptible elevations, or irregularities, on the moon's edge, situated just below the center of the arc; closely watcltecl and found to be steady, and to retain their relative positions. 5h oom.-Cusps clearly defined. 511 08m.-The limb of moon pr~jected 011 the Sllll 1s di;;;k, ;;;light]~· rolling, and rendering indefiuite. the elevations previously observed. 511 1om.-Ousps sharply defin(>d. 5h nm.-Sun's rays liecoming soft and mild. 511 12rn.-An apparent purplish tint around the edge of the mo<.m projected on the sun, gi\'ing the appearance of its being shaded oft to represent a sphere. 5h 14m,-The rolling or tremulousuess of the limb of the moon increasing, and that of the outline of the sun commenced. 51' rnm.-The sun's rays like those in winter. 511 17m.-Cusps undisturbed, except by the slight rolling or wa\'Y motion, like that caused b;\· the effect of radiated heat on the outline of a smooth bare hill, but iu a very mild degree. 5h ::nm.-Cusps sharply and clearly defined. Long shadows are cast. The summit of the Alleghanies appearing as when lit up by the last rays of the setting suu. 5h 30m.-Cusps very sharp and only slightly afft>cted bs rolling. 5h 31m.-Cusps as sharp as needles, and appearing to clasp the moon as if it were the smaller disk. At no time, so far, bas the moon been seen projected beyond the snu. !)h 32m,-Light fading rapidly awa;r. 5h 39m 13·.4.-A. cold dark shadow passed oYer the observatory, very distinct,Jy marked. The time was callml as I felt it. 5h 4om 32·.J.-Another shadow and a much colder one bounded by; anu although I was somewhat protected by the observatory, it appeared to strike me bluntly-forcibly, rather than to steal softly, quietly by. There was not a breath of air stirring. 5h 41m 02·.-Mr. Perkins noted and recorded a third sliaclow, thougl1 less distinctly marked, as if they were passing in waves. Thomas D. Walthall, esq., an intelligent gentleman residing at lfristol, and greatly interested on the subject of the eclipse, had undertaken, at my request, to note carefully the interval of time between the passage of the dark shadow over the hill, and its arrival, if per<;eptible, on the summit of the Alleghanies. He reported that he felt the shadow as it passed, aud noted 16 seconds of time before its effect was ~isible on the mountains lying east-southeast, and distant 18 miles. Just previous to totality, and when the crescent was dwindling to a mere thread, I raised, for

an instant, a marine-glass lying by my side and pointed it to the sun, but the light was even then too strong to allow of its use without a screen. 5h 41m 21·.1.-The first inner contact was made and timed with clearness and precision, there being apparently no disturbing or exaggerating causes to affect the outlines of either the moon or the suu. Their limbs were defined with the utmost clearness to the very moment when the last ray was extinguished. So soon as the time was called, the marine-glass was again raised and a hurried view taken of the corona; but on catching sight of the solar clouds, the, screen-glass was instantly removed from the telescope, and the time of totality devoted entirely to the protuberances. (See Plate No. 25, Figs. 3, 4, 5.) The corona appeared to be a broad circular band of silver-colored light, with an inner brighter rim, and with rays extending from different points, but very irregular in length and profusion. By far the longest rays were visible about 48° to the left of the vertex, or where the sun disappeared, and their length was estimated at the diameter of the moon. The rays on the opposite side of the circle were the next longest, being about half the length of the first mentioned. The lower left-hand quadrant appeared to be comparatively bare. At the first glance through the telescope, the large clond marked U, about 1800 from the vertex, attracted attention, and then A and B; the two or three to the right appearing to be quite ~mall in proportion. The position, shape, and dimensions of A, B, and 0 were determined as well as the means at my disposal would allO\v, and then of D and E; and it was while fixing the position of the last that the emersion (5h 43m 53s_3) was announced by a sudden increase of light, and then a flash, as if, before the sun was actually uncovered, a highly luminous body was exposed, sending a :tlood of light about half a seeond in advance of the sun's rays. The protuberances were of a pink color, varying in shade, and marked, with the exception of D, by smooth, rounded, and definite outlines. None were observecl on the upper half of the circle, or above a ~iameter drawn parallel with the horizon. .A and B, when first seen, were found to .be decreasing in size, while C, and especially D and E, were increasing and assuming their true form and size just as they were extinguished by the re-appearance of the sun. 'l'here were other elevations of the same character, but very low or close to the dark circumference, presenting the appearimce of a broken red line between D and E, which became visible just as the emersion took place. Portuberance C had two shades of pink, and appeared to be rolled up in itself. It was readily seen with the naked eye. The stem of D, I thought at one time was separated from the apparent dark edge of the moon, but of this I am not certain. There was no agitation of or break in the moon's or the sun's limlJ, either before, at, or after the second inner contact. Both retained their respective outlines as distinct and unbroken as during the partial eclipse. During totality a lantern was required to read the chronometer. The. return of light was gradual and without the distinct waves with which the darkness came. The times of emersion of the solar spots were not obtained with the same precision as those of the immersions. Each spot had to be clearly recognized before the time could be called, and before some of them could be so recognized they had been uncovered from one to five seconds. This correction was noted in each case at the time and applied to the times called and recorded, and was obtained by counting the seconds while the spot apparently moved over the distance it should have retrograded during the same time to have been fairly bisected by the dark line of the moon's limb. The called times of emersion thus con·ected are not believed, in any one of those cases, to be over a second in error.

The following memoranda were made at 1-he times stated: 5h 52m.-Cusps sharply defined, as during progress of emersion. 5h 5!Jm.-The moon's limb projected on the disk of the sun, slightly rolling toward !he cusps, while quiet and steady in the center of the arc. 611 30m 30'.-A low but decided elevation obsen·aule on the moon's liw b, nuder the upper cusp of the sun, close to the point of the cusp; \nitched, and no clrn11ge, and it, was uot affected by the slight rolling of the moou's outline. There was no distortion of the rusps at any time during the eclipse, nut eYen when the sun was close to the horizon; nor was tlwre au~· agitation of the outlines of the sun or moon until within a few seconds of the last contact. This agitation, ho\\eYer, wiu; not at that time sufficient to render their outlines indefinite. (ih 36m 40·.-Just as the moon separated from the sun, that part of the limb of the sun where the separation took place appeared to be considerably broken ; small pi~ces of the dark moon, like a broken black line, remaining along· the crumbling or dissolving edge of the sun, and presenting the appearance of dark and bright spots being interwoven, or intermixed, and so distinct was this black, broken line that I began to doubt whether the separation had been completed, and so again called the time (611 36m 50".6), when they tlisappeared. The sun's limb was then watched, and although the lllack Rpots hau gone, the crumbling Rppcarance of the sun's limb at the locality referred to continued, autl the time (G" 37m 40'.5) was again called when the outline had been entirely restore<l. Tile sun was then settling in the horizon. There was no phenomenon at all resembling this, the Baily beads, at any other time. The report of Assistant A. T. l\Iosmau is hereto annexed. In the two following- taules the times of contacts, immersions, and cmersions, respectfrely determine<l h~· Asi;istant l\Iosman and myself, are brought together.

bad in tlte report of AssiRtant Mosman.

In the report of F. W. Perkins, esq., aid, United States Coast Survey, he states that-

"A few minutes before the second contact the cattle commenced coming home; I could hear the fowls arranging themselves on the roosts in the neighbo1·ing trees, and, when the extreme dark· ness of totality fell upon us, the crickets commenced to chirp. The air grew perceptibly cooler, adding to the sensation of awe and admiration which so uncommon a phenomenon naturally pro· duced. "Mercury, Venus, and Saturn were visible, but I looked in ,-ain for stars in any of the northern constellations. "To the nakeu eyfl, and through a marine-glass used without shades, the corona was of a white light, and the protuberances of au intense white light, and clearly -visible to the naked eye. When a very light-red shalle was nse1l with the marine-glass, the protuberances appeared of a yellowish white color. "After totality the light seemed to re-appear much more rapidly than it had disappeared, the lamps used in reading tlte chronometer being dispensed with almost immediately after the third contact." Charles I. Allen, esq., of Plliladelphia, who tra velecl to Bristol for the purpose of observing the eclipse, reports: 11 0fthe rose-colored protuberances, the most distinct was directly opposite the vertex; it continued throughout the period of totalit.y, antl was -visible to the naked eye. A faint light of a rose color, in the shape of a cone, extended from it toward the center of the moon's disk. "A rosy protuberance on the left or south edge, about 90° from the vertex, appeared at the beginning of totality, but soon disappeared. On the north or right edge, 90° from the vertex, a protuberance similar to the two others appeared near the end of totality; also a long forked protuberance like two streamers, about 140° from the vertex. The two last were connected, just before the re-appearance of the sun, by a row of beautiful rose-colored beads." Iu the preceding report I have confined myself to a mere statement of facts and description of the phenomena as they appeared to me, deeming any discussion of theories or conclusions by any separate observer to be both inappropriate and unsafe until all the proof and evidence collected under yonr direction shall be brought together, criticised, aud compared. I am, respectfully, yours, RICHARD D. CUTTS. Professor BENJA.l\UN PEIRCE, Superintendent United States Ooatt Survey.

BRISTOL, TENNESSEE, A U[JU.~t U, lbGH. DEAR Sm : I have the honor to submit the following report of my observations of the solar eclipse of the 7th of August. The weather, at 41' 3om p. m., was partially cloudy, with flying cumuli clouds, the sky being covered. ~Wind cast-northeast, four in strength (on a scale of 10). Atmosphere very clear and steady. The moon's border was not seen before the first contact, nor w:is there an,y agitation of th., sun's limb in the region of the contact. Yery slight irregularities, which looked like mountains 1 were noticed on the moon's edge which was projected on the sun, as the eclipse advanced. The moon's edge began to appear tremulous at lJh 17m sidereal time, or at 5h 12m mean time. No spots were observed on the moon. No bright bands and -no illumination of the moon's disk were seen. The cusps appeared very sharp and well-defined throughout, with no distortions. The sun's edge began to be tremulous at 14h 35m sidereal time, or at 5h som mean time. No projection of the moon beyond the sun, and, before totality no rapid changes of the crescent, were seen; and the time of the first inner coutaet or beginuing of the total ohscnration was >ery well marked, quite sharply defined, and .-cr,r stcad,c 'l'Jie advance of the dark slrndow was not obseryed by me. During totality, solar cluwls were seen (see sketch), but JJO corona (proLabl,Y because out of the field of my telescope), and no clouds till tbe sun had disappeared. The two clouds, seen near the point where the sun disappeared were long, pencil like rays; the others had the appearance of ordinary cumuli clouds; the color of all was a yellowish white, antl they appeared statiouary and very steady during the whole time of ohscnration, and disappeared the instaut the sun re-ap11eared. (See Plate No. 25, Fig. 6.) I bad no time to examine the space between l\fercury and the sun for the snpposcd planet, and I saw no stars except Venus, as my attention was almost wholly directed to m,r telescope, watching, as I was, for the instant of the sun's re-appearance. An increased brightness of the sun's limb was noticed about five seconds before cmersion, but no flashes or bright rays. No projection of the moon beyond the sun was seen as the moon receded, and the edges of both the sun and moon were remarkably steady, and no distortion of either of the cusps was seen. The moon seemed of a uniform blackness as it receded; very slight irregularities, as on adYancing, were noticed, but no illumination of its disk and no spots on its surface. The moon was not seen after leaving the sun, but the sun's edge in the region of the last contact remained irregular for over a minute after the moon had disappeared. The following are the times of the different contacts, and tho immersion and emeri;ion of the spots, observed by me with sidereal chronometer Hutton 207, which was slow 3'.7, and in the next column are the observations in mean time. The rate of chronometer 207 was losing o·.04 per hour. The telescope used by me was reconnoitering-telescope No. 14, Unitell States Coast Survey; aperture, 3 inehes ; focal length, 2 feet 10 inches.

OBSERVATIONS AT SHELBYVILLE, KENTUCKY, AND AT OTHER STATIONS IN TIIE VICCTITY.
CAMBRIDGE, June l, 1871. In accordance with your instructions of July 7, 1869, I arranged for the observations of the total eclipse of August 7, to be made in Kentucky by officers of the United States Coast Sur-

·srn:

vey, in co.operation with the expedition sent out from the obseryatory of HarYard College. The stations selected were Shelbyville aud Bardstown, near the central line; Falmouth, near the northern limit of the shadow; and Oakland, near the southern limit. Shelbyville was made the principal station on account of the ad\Tantages it offered in it.s college buildings and grounds and itil fine l\iunich telescope, which were generously placed at our seryice by the proper authorities. It was thought best to have another station somcw hat nearer the central line than Shelbyville, for an additional chance of clear weather, and for the reason that t11e general appe11rance of the eclipse · might be different at different stations not far distant from eflch other. Bardstown seemed to me ~ sat.isfy these conditions. Observations for precision, including latitude, longitude, and time, were made by Mr. Dean · and Mr. Blake, at Shelbyville, and their reports have been forwarded to you. The photographic observations were made at this station. In that department uf the work I was assisted by ~Ir. Whipple, l\lr. George D. Clark, l\lr. John Pendergrast, and also by l\Ir. Williams, a photographer of Shelbyville, who kindly offered bis services. The instrument employed was the small equatorial of Harvard College observatory, which I had fitted up for this purpose. It bas a clear aperture of 5~ inches, and a focal length of about 7~ feet; and it is provided with an excellent driving-clock. Iu making preparations for the use of photography in these observations, I decided to take the pictures of the sun in the principal focus of the ubject.glass. I rPjected the method of enlarging the image with an eye.piece, adopted by Mr. De la Rue, in Spain, in 1860, aml by American astronomers who were preparing to photograph the eclipse of 1869, because, my main object being to S'.lcure a good picture of the corona, I did not think it expedient to enfeeble the light by enlarging the image. Another reason in favor of this method is that the distortion caused by the enlargement is avoided, a.nd the pictures can be measured more satisfactorily with a micrometer. The camera was fitted with a slide near the image, for instantaneous exposure in taking the partial phases. Dilling totality the slide was removed and the exposure was made by uncovering the object-glass.

The results were very satisfactory. ~We succeeded in obtaining about eighty photographs during the eclipse, seven of which were taken during totality. One of these, with an exposure of forty seconds, giYes a most satisfactory picture of the corona. I immediately recognized in this the fact that the corona was less in extent near tbe extremities of the sun's axis, and largest in the line of tbe equator. I Lave reason to think tbat this picture gives nearly all of the corona which can with certainty be considercu as belonging to the sun. Fainter light beyond the limits of this picture was seen by obsen·ers at this station, whose reports have been forwarded to you; but this light may be terrestrial, and is, 110 uoubt, partially so. l'tiy object in taking so many pictures of the partial phases was to ascertain the degree of accuracy with which they could be measured when taken in this-way. I hoped to obtain valuable information from them in regard to the use of photography in obserrntions of the approaching transit of Venus. I intended to make the measures in such a way that the distances between the centers of the sun and moon, or of the sun and Venus, would be obtained free from the effects of photographic irradiation. ·with J"Our authority, I ha>e since directed the construction of a micrometer Ly 1\fessrs. Ahan Clark & Sous for this purpose, aml many measures have been made with it, which indicate the possibility of an accuracy in this methou of observation greater eYen than I had antici1mtell. 'l'he micrometer bas two very accurate screws and a position-circle. The method of measuring was to find as accurately as conYenient the center of the sun or of the moon, and measure from this center radii, at suitable interyals, to both curves. The error of centering and the eccentricity of the curycs were then fouml by the method of least squares. 'Yhen this method of olJticrn1tion is applied to eclipses or to the transit of Venus, the positionangles may lJc determined by finding the positions of sun-spots with another tdescope. If the i)Iates are carefully iirepared with straight edges, the position-angles for the total phase may be determined by the positions of the cusps. Some of the results of measures of thetie photographs, together with engravings of the eclipse, and also a description, with engravings, of the micrometer, will be found iu my report to be published in the Annals of the Obserrntory of Harvard College. Soon after the eclipse I employed ~Iessrs. Ah-an Clark & Sons to make an object-lens of four inches aperture and forty feet focal length. Although this is a simple lens of plate-glass, without compensation for color, excellent pictures of the snn Ila Ye been taken with it. They are about four inches in diameter, and can be measured with the micrometer al>ove mentioned. I expect in this way to be able to measure the motions of sun-spots with a decree of accuracy that has not hitherto been attained. For spectroscopic obserrntions, an excellent equatorial telescope by l\Ierz, of feet focal inches aperture, was employed, to which was attached a spectroscope of length a111J two flint-glass prisms, made by Tronghton & Simms. The chromosphere was carefully examined, both before and after the eclipse. Only three lines could be seen: C, one near D, and F. During totality only the brightest protul>erauce on the lower limb of the sun was examined carefully. In the short time occupied in getting this, nothing was seen but a faint continuous spectrum; hut since the telescope took in only a small part of the spectrum at once, nothing conclusive can be inferred from the observation as to the non-existence of bright lines in the corona. During totality, eleven bright lines were seen. Besides the three already specified, thcr!' was a short line at or ver,v near E. The three lines of b were bright and very sharp, and there were four lines above F. Although these lines were Yery dark on a bright ground, all of them but the three seen before the eclipse disappeared instantly on the first burst of sunlight, and the same point in the sun's disk was examined with great care after totality without finding any of the lines except those above described. It was my intention to connect our standard break-circuit chronometer with the line of telegraph, so that its beats might be heard at any station on the line, and that the telegraph-clerks or other observers might register the times of contacts upon the fillets of the Morse registers at all telegraph-stations within the shadow; but as this was not possible, there being no line of telegraph through Shelbyville, I placed a second-pendulum in connection with the line at Oakland, and, by the co-operation of the assistants on the line, the duration of the total phase was registered at several stations, the results of which observations will be found in Mr. Dean's report.

0AMDRIDGE,

A ugu.~t 20, 1860.

Sm: Jn accordanee with your instmctious I tramnnit to you the following account of the observations made by me on the solar celipim of August 7. The station which you selected for me was Bardstown, Kentucky, a. little southwest of the central line of the eclipse. I was f'nrnished with an elegant. equatoTial telescope of four inches clear aperture, and firn feet focal length. Upon opposite sides of the tube of this telescope, and parallel to it, were attached two brass rods at the eye-end of the tube, and reaching about· a foot beyond it. Upon·these rods was fixed the spectroscope, and i11 sneh a manner that the slit was plainly visible. I found this arrangement of yours all that could lie desired. "\Yith it I bad little need of a finder. Pieces of white paper were pasted upon the brass work of the slit to receive the image of the sun, which, during tot:ility, could not well lrnrn been seen upon the polished brass. T.here was some danger of detaching this paper iu opening and clm;ing the slit, aml I therefore wished to change the width of the slit as few times as possible during totalit~'· The spectroscope attached to my telescope contained a single flint-glass prism an<l a three-prism direct-vision spectroscope screwed jn in place of its telescope. There were no means of measuring the positions of the lines. In order to bring ditforent parts of the spectrum into view it was necessary to unscrew a binding. screw, which then left the somewhat heaYy arm which carried the direct-vision spectroscope entirely loose, and then to move this arm with the hand and tighten up the screw. When this was done the arm would fall a little, aud it was only by looking at the spectrum, and estimating how much the arm would fall that it was possible to set upon any part of the spectrum. During totality tliere might be no light in the field if the observer were to move away from a protuberance, and, therefore, no means of knowing to what part of the spectrum, if any, the arm was set. If the slit was opened to give full light, the paper pasted on it might become detached and render it impossible to set the slit on a protuberance. There was no clockwork on the telescope, and the observ- ers were in continual apprehension of some disturbance in the crowd of mostly ignorant spectators, and therefore an attempt to move this arm was a thing to be dreaded. On the other hand, it could be so set as to afford a view of the spectrum from its red extremity up to half-way between F and G. Under the circumstances I woul<l not venture to move it. If I had been alone, and consequently at my case, I should have done so. My telescope was pointed for me by :Mr. N. S. Shaler, the geologist, who generously relin· quished his opportunity of witnessing the sublime rihenomenon undisturbed, and offered his assistance in the _astronomica\ observations. My telescope was, therefore, managed for me with perfect skill and coolness. Upon the morning of the 6th I set up my instrument and searched for protuberances. I found only one, which was upon the following side of the sun, and was very yellow, that is to say, the yellow line near D was relatively very bright in it. Indeed, I could not see the F line at all. On the morning of the 7th I examined the sun with greater care, and noted several pre>tuberances (which were afterward plainly seen at totality), but none of these were as brilliant as the one which had been seen the day before continued to be; and this was now less high, extended over a larger arc on the disk of the sun, and was still more yellow than it had previously appeared.

At the instant of totality my j telescope was pointed on this protuberance and my slit was rather narrow. At that instant the continuous spectrum vanished, and fi 1e lines, brilliantly colored, became visible. These were F, b, anotller dimmer and broader Iiue, say one· fourth of the distance· from b to D, the well-known yellow line near D and C. After ouscrving the spectrum of this protuberance at different positions, I looked at the sun, aml waf; pleasetl to find m.> conceptions of the shape and color of this protuberance entirely confirmed. The same glance showed me upon the southwestern limli of the suLI (wliere my liusiness chiefly lay) u, well-marked rose·colored protuberance. I first observed the spertrnm of another red protulieranee on the southern edge, and then that of the one just m~ntioned. I found the spectra of the red protuberances t.o be alike; they differed from that of tlie ;rPllow onp on!~· iu the relative greater brilliancy of the red, yellow, and blue lines in the former, the fainter green being especially much fainter. I have no doubt, from mr pre.-ious observatious, that the yPllow line was also less bright in the red protuberances, but it appeared :-;o bright that I could not perceirn that it was less bright than in the .vellow protuberance. Mr. Shaler then pointed for me on the corona, and I wa.'< jnst opening the slit to get more light when the sun burst forth and put an end to 111:1: observations. T1Yo seconds more, or a little more privacy, would have enabled me to get it. During the eclipse the following miscellauenns obsern1tious 11ere made hy l\[r. Shaler and me: The protuberancrs were of two distinct kinds: one sort ·was lmY, long, and yellow; the other high, short, and red. 1\fr. Shaler saw the disk of the sun break into llrads at tlJe momrnt of totality. The appearance lasted only an instant, and seemed as if it were the effect of ilwgnlarities of the limb of the moon. About a month before, 1\fr. Shaler hail obscrn'll 011 tlle limb of the moon a serrated appearance occasioned by a range of mountains. Mr. Shaler observed that the corona formed n <ptadrnngle, with eo!J(~ave sides ;-ertical and hor· izontal, the latter being the longest. He estimated its mean bl'eadth at one and a half the diam· eter of the suu. He found that it did not fade gradually :nrn.y, hut l1ad a sharply detined edge. I noticed the following points in reference to colors. \Yhile the eclipse was coming on there was no chan~e in the colors of the landscape or of peopk's faces, but the light had a singular the· atrical effect, owing· to the shar1mcss of the shadows. During totality, the light on the lanclscape was like the gray of twilight. The moon, at this ti uu·, was not black, but of a deep, dull, and somewhat purplish blue, darker than the sk;r. .!\Ir. Shaler contlrmcfl this. The sky was of a dark purplish blue. It was not lighb.~r near the corona. The corona wa.-. (]uite white arnl not bluish. The yellow protuberances were greeni8h like thr aurora, nnd iutrnsPly brilliant. The red ones hacl much tbe color of the light from Lydrogen in a GcisslN' tube. Upon the south, and also (as l\fr. Shaler says) on the north, was a salmon-colored light upon the horizon, reacl1i11g up some five degrees or more. Venus and Mercur.r looked as white as Vega cwr look:-;. 1\fr. Shaler says: "Little effect was Yisible on animated nature until the In.st file minutes before totalit.y, except that the cocks all began to crow, at RPveral points, with thP sleepy crow of early morning and not the exultation of full da,v. 'l'he hirds hPgnn to rnakP their nesting-cries as the light rapidly waned. Cattle were cvillently much alarmed, nnd ran, with tails up and heads erect, across the fields almost in stampede. At the close of the eclip8e a hen "·ns found, with her chick· ens under her wings. Four months' old cllickrns were Reen, within ten minutes of the total eclipse, quietly feeding. They then disappeared. '.l'he crowd was placl'd, at the request of the ohserwr, beyond a fence, distant about thirty feet from ihe tcleseopt·. .At the moment of totality a hollow sound, half of fear, half of admiration, called attention to their faces, with dropped jaws and look of horror, which were turned toward the wreck of t1ie sun. There is 110 doubt that exceeding fear took possession of the whole people. The many who were present slipped away quietly; the few who staid after totality seemed singularly quiet, e1idently rC>co1cring from a considerable nervous shock." · ~<\.ll of which is respectfully submitted, &c.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Professor J. Lawrence Smith has furnished the following memoramlum of his own observations: The :observations at Bardstown were limited in their character, being directed specially to spectroscopic observations. J\Ir. C. S. Peirce, of Cambridge, made one set of observations with the spectroscope attached to a telescope, while I made observations with the spectroscope detached. I also observed the solar thermometer, and the intensity of the chemical action of the light as measnretl by strips of silvered paper, expmmd frequently at uniform intervals, for tlie spaces of one minute to the direct action of the sun, from the commencement of the eclipse to the termination of the totalit~-. I also made barometrical measurements at different times. But as the instrument used was a pocket-aneroiU, very little reliance can be placed upon them. The temperature of the direct rays of the snn was 111° Fahrenheit, and diminished rapidly during the passage of the disk of the moon across the sun, until, at the complete obscuration of the sun, the thermometer stood 100 lower than it did in the shade at the commencement of the eclipse. The chemical action of the rays of the sun diminished gradually, until the action of the sun had but little effect on the silvered paper after ten minutes. The most interesting part of my observations is, that a good single-prism spectroscope will give at least four bright rays in the protuberances, unaided by a telescope, to form a disk of the sun. The spectroscope attached to the telescope gave Mr. Peirce five lines, but I do not think that I speak too confidently in stating that five lines might have been seen by the naked spectroscope had it been better mounted for giving direction to it. The four bright lines, as nearly as I could make them out, were one in the red, iu or near the line C; one in the orange, in or near D; one in the green; and one in the blue, in or near F.

MEMORA...'\DUl\I BY ARTHUR SEARLE OF \YORK DO:N"E AT FAL:\IOI'"TH, KEXTlTCKY, ON .tlfGUST 6 AND 7, 1869, WITH REFERENCE TO OBSERYATIONS OF THE SOLAR ECLIPSE.

The instruments taken to Falmouth were the Lerebours telescope from Harvard College observatory; the Dollond telescope from Saint Paul's Clrnrch, New York; a pendulum regulated to beat seconds, and provided with a break-circuit attachment; two l\Iorse telegraphic registers and reels; three break-circuit keys; and a stop-watch. A second stop-watch, meant for the Falmouth station, was forgotten and left at Shelbyville. :Mr instructions were to obsen·e personally the duration of the total phase hy means of one of the Morse registers (provided the electrical apparatus could be brought into action before the eclipse), observing the disappearance of the sun with a telescope, its re-appearance with the naked eye, aud not attempting any estimate of the time by ear, but confining my attention to giving the electrical signals as accurately as possible; to have an observation taken by :M:r. West, the Falmouth telegraph-operator, of the duration of the total phase, with the office-register, by similar signals; and to assign work to any volunteer-observers according to my own judgment. I reached Falmouth about 10 a. m., Falmouth time, on August 6. On inquiry, nothing couhl be heard of Mr. Ross, who had been thought likely to be found in Falmouth, and available as one observer; but two gentlemen, Captain "\V. 0. Crozer and Captairr 1V. E. Arnold, both civil engineers, kindly volunteered their services, which proved of very great value. Mr. West had reeeived instructions with respect to the proposed observations, and furnished me with every facility for carrying out the plans which had been formed. The short interval remaining before the eclipse made it necessary that the station for the observations should be plaeed near the telegraph-office, in order that Mr. West might have time to make the arrange· mente required without neglecting his regular business. Leave was therefore at once requested and obtained from the owner of the field on the opposite side ~f the railroad to erect a small stand

there. Tlle stand was put up in the course of the afternoon, an upright case being attached to one end of it for the pendulum, which required protection from the wind and weather as well as from interference by bystanders. The boards inclosing it on one side were fastened by screws, so that it was easily got at when desired. It was set up and partially adjusted before night, but, as the workman who was to make a loop in the telegraph-line could. not do so till morning, it was taken down and replaced in its box. 1\fr. West received the materials for a local battery toward nigllt, and during the eyening be contrived the connections required for working the three registers with the pendulum and breakcircuit keys, making a diagram of the positions of the wires, so as to set them up readily the next
da~

·

Early on August 7, a loop in the telegraph-line was brought to the stand; lmt )fr. "'est's regular occupations prevented him from getting the local battery and wire connections set up until near noon ; and;then the control of the line could not be had for the purpose of experimenting with the pendulum. Shortly before the eclipse, the pendulum was adjusted so far as possiule. Its l.Jreak seemed somewhat longer than desirable, but further experiments were interrupted by messages upon the line, and soon after by the pendulum from Oakland, which was found to work satisfactorily. :'.\Ir. West did not succeed in getting control of the line again for any further adjustment of the Falmouth pendulum, which, as it happened, w:1s not needed, the Oakland pendulum continuing to break the circuit regularly. J\Ieanwhile, Messrs. Crozer & Arno1tl had collected seYeral other gentlemen willing to assist i11 the obsen'ations. The telescopes had been placed on the stand early in the afternoon, and the registers and keys were iu position, and "-ere found to work promptly. Captain Crozer undertook to use one of the telescopes in connection with the third register. To prHent irregularities in the running of the registers, I had requested 1'Ir. West t-0 provide an assistant for each to keep them working properly; and he assigned this duty to bis two subordinates, who were used to the management of telegraphic apparatus. ::\Ir. "\Yest managed his own register himself, and observed without a telescope. I took the Lerebours glass, and gave Captain Crozer the Dollond. By way of practice, Captain Crozer and Mr. West several times took the interval between signals, given as described hereafter, with their keys and registers, and found no., difficulty, on any occasion, in obtaining legible and closely agreeing results. Rut the observation of the total phase of the eclipse by this method proveu almost a complete failure. ::\Ir. \Y est's register seems to have run well, but no signal for the 1·e-appearance of the sun can be found on the fillet. The signal may perhaps be coincident with one of the breaks of the pendulum. Captain Crozer's register ran very irregularly, as the fillets seem to sl101r, and, although it is probable that all his signals are recorded, it is doubtful whether their places can be clearly ascertained. Ile thinks he gave one tap only for the disappearance of the sun, and for its re-appearance (observed with the naked eye) two taps, the second of which is to be preferred. Tile fillet of my own register was broken, the register stopped, and not started again, several seconds before the total phase began; and my taps, which I think were given as accurately as any I am in the habit of giving on the Jhrouograph-key, were not recorded. I did not disco,·er this, of course, until after tile total phase was over, when, on inquiry for the electriool records, the facts just sta.ted appeared. \Ye must, therefore, depend chiefly upon the stop-watch, and upon a tally observation by Captain Arnold. The stop-watch had been placed in charge of }fr. R. W. Grant, whom I directed to station himself upon a hill toward Covington, just beyond the railroad-bridge, both to obtain au obserrntion nearer the border of the shadow, and to lessen the chance of confusion and of interference with the observer by bystanders. Before leaving the stand, )Ir. Grant repeatedly took the interval between signals, which I gave him from some distance, with my eye upon my own watch. His results uniformly agreed with mine to the fifth of a second, and I believe his observation to be a very good one. 11.fr. W. Clarke has promised to see that the place where Mr. Grant stood is marked by a stake; but it is already indicated by the most northerly of three stumps on the hill, close to which he stood. This stump may perhaps be two rods from the fence near it. H. Ex. 206--1 i

Tbe lluration of the tobl phase at l\Ir. Grant's station was forty-one and six-tenths seconds as indicated by tlle stop-wateh. This observation is confirmed by Jut1ge Ilnduall, who took the time by his own watch at the same station, and found it to be forty-one secornl~, arnl some fo1ction (he thouglit a small one) of another second. I was fortunate enough to obtain tlle aill of two gentlemen, l\fessn;. B. John80U anu D. Yelton, who consented to give up seeing the total phase of the eclipse for the purpose of recording by tally an observation undertak('n by Captain Arnold, at the staud. Tlie preliminary drill for tu is observation was as follows: The tallymen were seated facing Captain Arnold, and at some distance behind them signals were given by l\Ir. Scott, by smartly raising one piece of pasteboard from behind another. Captain Arnolll repeated these signals to the tallymen by rapid gestures of his hand. As t!Ie telegraph-li11e was in use for messages when we began our experiments, I counted seconds from my watch for the tally. Both tallymeu began recording at tile same seoond, the mark for every flt'th second being drawn across the four preceding marks, as usual in keeping tally, for convenience in counting. On recei>ing Captain Arnold's first signal, l\Ir. J ollnson stopped his tally while Mr. Yelton went on with his, stopping at Captain Arnold's next signal, upon which l\Ir. Johnson resumed his ta11y, and continued it until the word was given to stop. The whole number of seconds counted from the watch serYed as a check for the accuracy of the work, which soon became correct almost every time. Meanwhile, Judge Lee and Mr. C. A.·w andelohr endeavored to estimate the fractional part of a second at which J\Ir. Scott gaYe his signals, and their results agreed well together. As soon as the Oakland pendulum could be replaced on the line, the click of the magnet was snbstitnted for my count of seconds; Captain Orozer and 1\fr, West began observing and recording Mr. Scott's signals with their registers, as a hove stated, and I observed by eye and ear. On each trial I found that Judge Lee's and llfr. Wandelohr'il estimate of fractional parts of seconds agreed well with mine; that the tally record agreed with my silent count of whole seconds; and that both the ::\Iorse registers confirmed these observations. I did not wish to fatigue the obserYers by too frequent a repetition of this work immediately before the total phaBe; and as the eclipse was already far advanced, I satisfied myself with a few repetitions of the experiment. It was unorftunate that, just as the total phase was about to begin, the train from Lexington drew up at the station, remained there during the totality, with the passengers shouting, screaming, laughing, and talking nll the time, and started again as the sun l'e-appeare<l. Hearing this hubbub, I ga>e up my tally observation for lost; but, after learning the failure of the electrical apparatus, I was doubly pleased to ftnd that, although Mr. Yelton, on whom the result chiefly depended, had found it ,-ery difficult to hear the magnet, and was therefore not so sure of the correctness of his work as he wouhl otherwise h:we been, there was still >ery little doubt that, by Captain Arnold's obserYation, the total phase had lasted forty-fiye seconds. Judge Lee and :Mr. Wandeohr had been uua ble to hear the magnet sufficiently well to estimate the fractional parts of seconds, but in any case some doubt must lmYe existed as to this part of the _observation, unless I had asked these gentlemen also to gh-e up seeing the total phase, and to look only to Captain ArnolU's sig. nals. Captain Arnolu himself has considered that it would he safest to confine his attention to giving his signals correctly, and not to attempt to estimate the fraction of a second at which be gave them. He is inclined to think, however, that the interval was nearly an exact number of seconds, and that, if not forty-five seconds exactly, it should be considered a little less rather than at all beyond that time. His observation is confirmed by one taken inuependently by Mr. Woodson, with his own watch, and assisted by a friend, upon a platform of the railroad-station. Mr. Woodson found the duration of the t-0tal phase to differ very little, if at all, from forty-five seconds.

I learn, also, that :'\Ir. Kuight, observing from the hotel, anrl that :'\fr. Johnson (father of our tallyman), obsening from his house, somewhat, southwest of the hotel, obtained the same result. But as I have not seen these gentlemen,' some doubt may exist as to the accuracy of' the reports given me of their obserrntions, or of the entire independence of the obserrntion~ themselves. 'l'he positions of the principal obseners are marked by stakes thus:

Tl.le stakes are from two to fi rn feet avart. The diagram exaggerate;; their distance,>;. l\Ir. D. Crozer, jr., of Catawba, about four and a half miles from Falrnoutl1, informs me that be obserwd the duration of tile total phase at that place to be twelve seconds. Ilis father noted the time with his own watch. ::Hr. Crozcr promises to han a stake set at once where he stood when making this ouscrvatiou. Two points are reported "-here the eclipse seemeu just to fail of totality: one is John Johnsou's house, above Antioch meeting-house, about eight miles east of' Falmouth; the other is a place kuown to l\Ir. A. R. Clarke, about sewn miles from Falmouth, lml these ob:-cr"'ations are probably not accurate enough to be of service. The tally record will be serYiceahle, not only in directly exhi!Jiting tlle length of the total phase, but also in deciphering the fillets from the l\Iorse rC'gisters; for l\Ir. West thinks that the three registers were all startetl Yery nearly at the same instant, and I gave the signal for the tally· men to beg'in their record a few seconds after directing the registers to be started. )fr. Johnson's tally comprises one hundred and eighty seconds; l\Ir. Yelton's two hundred and twenty-five seconds, with one additional mark, whh:h he is certain he made after Captain Arnold's signal for the re.appearance of the sun. An examination of the fillets, rwHle at Cambridge, August 17, 18G9, gi\·es some little ground for the following conjectures: That Captaiu Crozer's register was started about fiye seconds before Mr. West's (or that" a few marks on Captain Crozer's fillet belong to one of the pre>ions experiments); that l\lr, West's first break failed to be reconled, or coincides with a break of the pendulum; that about thirty-four seconds after Captain Crozer's first break his register began runuin g slow, and two seconds later became almost stationary, and continued so for some three seconds ; that it was then started "·ilh a jerk which caused i.he next three or four seconds to be recorded irregularly, arnl in a broken manner; tlmt the first of the two breaks, sup;iosed to have been given by Captain Crozcr for the sun's re·appearance, was gi\·cn with hesitation, and appears as two very short breaks upon the fillet; and finally, as the rnsult of the preceding conjectures, that Mr. West's observation would make the length of the total phase only abon t forty-four and four-ten th8 secou ds, and Captain Crozer's observation forty-four and six-tenths secguds. Ent it is doubtful whether this conjectural result deserves any farther consideration. The stop-watch used at Falmouth. was compared with the east clock at Harrnr1l College observatory, August 20, 1869, and found to gain on that clock two seconds in thirty-eight minutes. The clock gained about two-hundredths of a second in the same time, if rnnniug at its ordinary rate. The stop-watch, therefore, gains on true mean time o·.053 in one minute, or o·.038 in two.thirds of a minute. This rate a,grees closely with th.at given by G. l\I. Sea,rle (W.03 for the duration of the total phase as observed by the stop-watch at Falmouth) from comparisons of the same stop-watch made by him in New York before the eclipse. The remaining observations at Falmouth were as follows: '11hc time given is that of my watch (near New York time). Below are comparisons of this watch with chronometer Frodsham 3451, at Shelbyville, and with G. l\f. Searle's watch, which last was fast of Shelbyville mean time 4m25·

Judge Hudnall, at Mr. Grant's station, observed the end (?) of the total phase at 511 31zm by his watch, which was 44 slow of mine when compared with it at 6h 36m 45'. Nothing was seen of "Baily's beads," I believe, by any observer; but the cusp of the sun was broken into seyeral irregular fragments a few seconds before the total phase, according to the observations of Captain Crozer and myself. During the total phase, no observer used a telescope. A somewhat douhtful observation of l'ed prominences was made to the south of the principal ~tation by Messrs. C. B. Wandelohr and r. F. Bonar, who report that they thought they saw one large prominence on the upper limb of the sun and three small ones to the left. l\Irs. Arnold saw a "star'' under the moon (probably the large protuberance observed there at other stations). The corona seems to have presented much the same appearances to all obseners, allowing for differences of description. It closely resembled the best published engravings of this phenomenon as I saw it, but no special peculiarities were noticed in it. l\Iessrs. "'\V. W. Ireland, A. R. Clarke~ W. G. Cooper, ;iml Dr. Barbour observed for stars visible during totality; and other observers also reported on the same subject. Three small maps of stars near the sun were used. There seems to be no doubt that Mercury, Venus, and Regulus were all visible during the total phase. Mr. W. G. Cooper describes Regulus as very brilliant, in a written report which I received from him; but the star may have been easily confounded with Venus. Arcturus, Vega, and Saturn were distinctly seen by various oltservers. Mrs. Murphy saw two meteors during the total phase. The first was traced from a point near the meridian and not far from the zenith toward the southeast ; the course of the second was from the northwestern to the southwestern part of the sky. Mrs. Arnold reports the usual phenomenon of poultry corniug to roost during the eclipse. The diminution of light was not at any time very great. A lantern had been provided for the tallymen, but I believe no use was made of it, and the darkness seemed onls about equal to what is usual a minute or two after a clear sunset. · The shadow of the moon was noticed, I understand, by some observers toward the north, but does not seem to have boon regarded as a striking phenomenon. (The driver of the stage between Eminence and Shelbyv·ille says that it appeared to him no more distinct or dark than an ordinary cloud-shadow.)

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF
REPORT BY PROFESSOH S. P. LANGLEY OF OBSERVATIONS AT OAKLAND, KENTUCKY.

DEAR Sm: On the 3d of August, I left Louisville, with l\lr. Graham Wilder, arriYing at Oakland the same day. It is a station on the Louisville and Nashville road, with only one or two houses :tn the vicinity, and no telegraph-office within ten miles. No buildings being accessible near the track, I had two small sheds, each about 8 feet by 10, moved into the field bordering the railroad, to a site which commanded a fair view westward. No entirely satisfactory site was procurable. ·we made these sheds water-tight as far as we could, and by Thursday evening (the 5th) had mounted in them the instruments. These consisteil of a Coast Survey zenith-telescope, loaned by Mr. Dean (which I mounted, but unfortunately could not use, both the nights of the 5th and Gth being rainy;) of a chronograph and a telescope of about 3-inch aperture, which I brought from Pittsburgh; of a ]\forge register and a pendulum beating sidereal seconds, with a stop-watch; and the necessary batteries, &c . .Mr. Wilder brought with him a good pocket-chronometer made by Reardon, of London, but we were without the local time. All these, except the zenith-telescope, were placed)n the shed looking west, the site of which is carefully marked and described in a memorandum placed in the charge of the Coast Survey. The telegra11h-operator, Mr. De Brie, arrived Friday afternoon, and connected our station with the main lines. The spare time was occupied in practicing the observers, by noting the times l>etwean rnrions signals made at irregular intervals for the purpose, and in trying to procure and instruct amateur observers in noting times by their watches, the latter with poor success. On the afternoon of the 7th, our isolated station was the resort of all the inhabitants of the adjoining country, -white S.nd black, -who crowded around the sheds, interrupted the view, and pro1ed a great annoyance. A special train from Bowling Green brought some hundred more, who arrived upo:i the gTound and within the inclosure just before totality, very opportunely, with a brass band. Our arrangement was as follows: The pendulum broke the circuit on the chonograph, Morse register, and main line. I observed immediately in front of the shed, using the telescope of say 3-inch aperture, and a terrestrial eye-piece of about 30 diameters magnifying-power, recording on the chronograph. l\Ir. "\Vilder, near me, used a good field-glass and the Morse register. 1\Ir. De Brie, naked eye and register; the latter being instructed to count the beats audibly, between internal contacts, as a safeguard in case the register failed. We were expecting about thirty seconds' totality, from the presumed latitude of Oakland. The phenomenon of Baily's beads was so unusually protracted as to prepare me for the conelu.sion that we were much nearer the edge than I had expected, but the almost instantaneous re-appearance of the light took me by surprise. AH the records of our observations were placed in charge of :Mr. Dean, by me, when I left I.ouisville, and I take the following figures fro.m memory : S. P. Langley (from chronograph), duration of totality .... _...... __ ...... is.7.'i G. Wilder (from l\lorse fillet), duration of totality.. . · . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . 28 .05 De Brie (from Morse fillet), duration of totality (conjecture) . _...... _..... 18 ·

I saw the light dwindle to a star-like speck, which hung on the limb about a second after the rest went out (and which was due, as I conjecture, from its distinctive appearance to a lunar cleft); as this was disappearing, I struck the key and removed my eye from the telescope, but saw an almost simultaneous burst of light from the sun, and signaled again after looking once more through the instrument. I have no doubt that in my case the l8. 75 is a sufficiently large estimate. Mr. Wilder, who, like myself, was expecting a longer interval, is satisfied that .bis 2·.05 is too large. Mr. De Brie struck once coincidentally with Mr. Wilder, and, as he says, had no time to strike again before the sun re-appeared. If, under these circumstances, it be permitted, as I think it may, to correct the record from one's impressions, noted at the time, I should say that there was .an instant of undoubted totality, lasting, perhaps, one second, but not in any case; more and that the only circumstance affecting

THE

135

the estimation, which might increase it, was that the light apparently sllone 1 as I have stated, through a lunar cleft, for an instant, after the limb, properly speaking, had covered the sun. In Yiew of this, I think that the true totality lasted not less than O'.;; 110r morr tlian 2~, aml that a mean of these times should be taken as the basis of computation. It is evident tllat we were placed almost precisely on the edge of the shadow; and, in further confirmation of this, a reliable observer, l\Ir. Strange, who, at my request, stationed himself at the house of Luther Carpenter, described as near the railroad, two miles west and half a mile south, found th( eclipse partial only, the light being too dazzlingly bright to gaw fix:e1lly 011, eYeu at tlie greatest obscuration. I have been thus prolix in describing the circumstances under which the contact:-; wrre noted as''° were fortunate in being nearer the edge of the shadow than we could have designedly ventured, and, it may be hoped, successful in fixing its limit with precision. If this be the case, I Rlrnll feel in a large measure compensated for the loss of a Yiew of the general pl1enome1rn of tlie eclipse, of which I saw necessarily little. I omitted to state that all the contacts were similarly recorded on the chronograph and reduced to the time by the Heardon watch. I had a light-darkening glass before my eye, through which I uoted ·what foilo»s, in the ycry brief time presented: On the left or eastern limb of the sun (with direct Yisio11) v.ere thrre prominrnt tiames; tlle upper, about 55'.l.from the vertex, was larger, more diffuse, softer in outline, and paler in color tliau the two lower-suggesting a different constitution. Of these two, the lower was about HP a hove the last poiut where the light lingered. A group of prominences, low and prolonged, secmetl to he on the right of the sun. The corona was very notably diffe.reut from ms nnticipation, being visilJle through the darkening glass as a halo close to the sun, whence radiateJ. a number of brushes of pale light, some about ·the solar diameter (perhaps less) in length, not noticeably cuned, and ::;ug·gesting at the time a comparison with the auroral streamers; thougli hy this I do not mean tn necessarily imply apparent motion. In one particular I was fortunate as a spectator. "Bail~·'s beads," so called, were seen for fifteen seconds or more. They were long· and tlliu, rather tllan points of light, apparently mo-rnd witll the moon, "went ont '' Yery much like sparks upon the edge of a piece of rough paper, and if a very deliheratr Yiew, when others were hurried, enable me to form any confident opinion, I should say were nnquestiouahly the effect of the inegularities of tlie moon's contour exaggerated by irridation; at least, t!lf'y 1n·e'H'ntetl iwccisely the appearance we might expect this to cause. 1 am, sir, Yer,y respectfully, ;rours,
S. P. LAXG LEY.

Professor

JosEPR \YIXLOCK.

The following account has. been furnished by 1\fr. Cl. ~r. Searle, -n-ho ohseryed the eclipse at Shelbyville : l\Iy measurement of its duration by the stop-watcll was ~rn 3±·.IJ, hut 1 am not indined to give any weight whatever to this, being of the opinion that both bPginning and end were ohserYed several seconds too late, my attention being distracted by watching the rnornment of the shadow. This I saw immediately before the totality as a brick·red tinge on the low haze or thick air in the uorthwcstern horizon; shortly before the end its limits were plainly Yisible on the sky. About a minute or so before the totality I saw the complete disk of the moon, with the incipient corona in the form of short brushes of light perpendicular to the limb, and about 2 minutes or 3 minutes in length, apparently equably di3tributed. I did not notice whether these ill creased in length before the total obscuration, and am not sure whether I saw them 'lith the naked eye or opera· glass. This last was a binocular marine-glass, of the largest pos:-.i!Jle diameter, furnished by Assistant G. W. Dean. The corona, which appeared at the total obscuration, and clitl not, so far as I noticed, change its shape subsequently, was prolonged in four directions; at, least, such is my impression, these directions being vertical and horizontal, 01· nearly so. Its length, in these directions, was about equal to the diameter of the moon; its shortest length about one-third of this, I should say; and it

136

REPORT OF THE S"C PERI~TENDENT OF

appeared to me decidedly iu tlte form of rays, not of concentric riugs, as described, I believe, by Mr. Frankenstein. I did not notice any protuberance immediately, but the eclipse had not lasted more than half a minute, probably, when I noticed, without specially looking for it, and I think with the naked eye, the principal protuberance apparently directly below. It appeared to me of a yellow color, and it was not till toward the close of the eclipse that it seemed to assume a deeper, or reddhih tinge-I should call this color pink, properly. Half a minute, or perhaps more, before the close of the eclipse, another appeared about 10°, as I should say, below the extreme right-hand limb of the moon, but I did not notice any marked color in this, and did not look at it closely; in fact, I did not examine the other attentively, being too much engaged in looking for planets. I did not see any stars except Venus, "Mercury, and Regulus; the two first were, of course, >ery conspicuous during the whole of the totality. I am not sure whether I saw the latter with the naked eye or not. The darkness was not so great as to need the lantern which I had prepared for examining my chart of the he~wens. Some gentlemen at m:y side, whom I requested to note what stars they saw, reported what evidently, from their position, must have been Arcturus, Veg·a, and Saturn. Neither the beginning nor tlie end of the eclipse seemed to me to produce a \ery nrnrked change in the amount of light, espeoially the former, and I did not uotice the edge of the shadow moving over the landscape, though my position on the roof of the court house was quite a high one, and commanded a fine view. l\fy attention was, however, somewhat distracted by the sun itself. I think that if there had been any stars as bright, or within a quarter of a magnitude as bright, as Regulus, between that star and Mercury, and within 30 of the ecliptic (at least on the northern side), I should not have failed to see them. I did not, however, see r Leonis, or any of the other stars of that const~llation. I had a spy-glass of abont 1:1" inches :iperturr, but did not use it much during the totality. Is it not possible that the prolongations of the corona have some connection with the prominences ·l They seem to correspond with them in position. The birds about the building were apparently quite excited during the totality and flew about wildly. JUr. Alrnn G. Clark, who ollserved the eclipse at Shelbyville through the finder of the Shcllly· Yille equatorial, states that after the first contact, which was promptly seen by him, nothing of especial interest occurred until the sun was about half covered. Then bis attention was called, bJ' Professor Winlock, to small objects crossing the field of the finder, in straight lines, and supposed by both observers to be meteor8. Mr. Clark llimself observed about twenty of these objects. Mr. Clark was able to see through the finder, when opened to its full capacity (11 inches), radial lines in the largest protuberance, which was situated near the base of the sun. On the side were two narrow, horn-like protuberances, which extended twice as far as any of the others. Mr. J. I. Bowditch also observed the eclipse at Shelbyville. He estimated the height of the rays which proceeded from the corona at one-third of the moon's diameter. He noticed three red flames, the most brilliant of which was on the upper edge. Its height was between one-tenth and one-twentieth of the moon's diameter. Baily's beads, though looked for, were not seen, although the edge of the sun, just before totality, lost its usual smoothness. During the total phase it was easy to read fine print at half the distance required by daylight. "With close attention, the secondhand of a watch could be seen. Mercury, Yenus, and some of the fixed stars had a brilliant appearance. Mr. J. J. Dixwell reports to Professor Winlock that he observed tlle eclipse from the top of the college building in Shelbyville, Kentucky, partly with the naked eye and partly through one of Clark's nary-glasses, mounted upon a firm post. With the naked eye the corona appeared like a rim of great brilliancy, encircling the moon, gradually decreasing in brightness as the distance from the moon's edge increased, and fading wholly away at the distance of half a diameter. It exceeded in brightness full moonlight, and such ,an appearance might have naturally suggested to early observers on similar occasions that the moon was surrounded by an extensive atmosphere, the densest parts of which were the brightest. Through the glass the appearances were very

137

different. The corona spread out in rays of Yery irregular leugtb, the longest of which extended more than a diameter from the moon. One observer thinks that the maximum length was one diameter and a half. Generally, the rays radiated from the moon's center, though there were some deflections. They were grouped in four great pencils or cones of' irregular size, connected by shorter rays, forming together a continuous halo. The largest was on the upper lefthand limb. Along the edge of the moon numerous tongues of intense brilliancy were distributed, one of which was particularly obser\·ed. It was on the lower limb of the moon, exceeded in size and brightness all the others, and resembled a fountain of molten metal, rising in the center to the height of about one-twentieth of the moon's diameter, overflowing on each side in the form of two arches. The light was intensely white, like that of Sirius. Mr. Dixwell observed the contact of the moon with some of the solar spots. The time in which the record is made was found to be m:;m 33· fast of Shelbyville mean sofar time.

REPORT BY G. W. DEAN, ASSISTANT UNITED 8TATES COA8T SUR\"EL

FALL RIVER, Septeml>et' 2, 1869.
DEA.R Sm: In accordance with your. instructions of June 28, I proceeded to organize an astronomical party to co·operate with a party under the direction of Professor Joseph Winlock,

director of the Harvard College observatoryffor the purposes of observing the solar eclipse on the 7th of August, at several of the most favorable points within the limits of the shadow in the State of Kentucky. Shelbyville, located about thirty miles easterly from LouisYille, and near the central line of the shadow, presented many favorable inducements for establishing the principal astronomical station at or near that place. Beside$ this, the honorable board of trustees of Shelbyville College had gljllerously placed their large equatorial telescope at the service of Professor Winlock. On the 12th of July, I proceeded to make arrangements for erecting the temporary observatories required for making a series of Jatitufle-observations, and for sheltering the larger instruments to be used on the 7th of August. Sub-Assistant F. H . .Agnew, having in charg·e a portion of the astronomical instruments, arrived at Shelbyville on the 16th; and Mr. F. Blake, jr., a.id in the Coast SurYey, reported in person for duty on the 21st. . · On the 22d, Professor Winlock arrived from Cambridge, and, on the following day, made arrangements for dismounting the Shelbyville equatorial, in the dome of the college·bnilding, and remou~ting it near the Coast Survey station in the southwestern portion of the QOllege-grounds· .Arrangements were at the same time made for adjusting the Clark equatorial, which was-to be used by Mr. J . .A. Whipple, of Boston, in photographing the phases of the eclipse, nuder tbe immediate direction of .l'rofeBsor Winlock. H. Ex. 206--18.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDEl\'T Ol·'

On the 24th of July, Mr. Blake began a series of latitude-observations, which he complet.ed on the 3d of August. These consisted of one hundred and sixty-four obserrntions, upon fourteen pairs of stars, with zenith-telescope No. 6, Coast Survey. The arc value of one dictsion of the micrometer was determined from forty observations upon P-0laris near the eastern elongation. One set of twenty measurements with the micrometer were made in the usual manner for determining the arc value of the level-divisions. On the 26th of July, Charles S. Peirce, esq., arrived from Cambridge, and, after examining the adjustments of bis instruments, he proceeded to Bardstown, Kentucky, and there made observatiom1 with the spectroscope upon the eclipse, the results of which he has reported to Professor Winlock. On the 3d of August, Messrs. George D. and Alvan G. Clark, the well-known opticians of Cambridge, reached Shelbyville, and soon had the large equatorial in good working order. On the 5th of August, J. A. Whipple, esq., of Boston, joined us at Shelbyville, and, with the assistance of Messrs. George D. Clark, Albert Stcyens, and J. Pendergrast, soon bad the photographic apparatus in working order, ano an the arrangements in detail for the photograpbie operations completed. For several days immediately preceding the 7th of Anguflt the weather was particularly unpleasant, insomuch that nothing could be done, by way of adjusting the larger instruments, until the morning of the 7th, when, at 1 o'clock, the heavy clouds began to break, and in a few hours we had a clear, cool atmosphere and a cloudless sky, which continued until the eclipse observations had been successfully completed. It is perhaps unnecessary to say that this oay proved an unusually laborious one to all the members of the eclipse-party, but it is gratifying to state that the faithful labors of each one were rewarded by good success. Spectroscope.-A$ Professor Winlock will probably soon publish a full report of his spectroscopic observations on the solar eclipse, I will only say that he recognized eleven bright lines, whereas, under the most favorable circumstances, only five can generally be seen. He used the Shelbyvil~e College equatorial, having a focal length of 9.Z feet and an aperture of 7.Z inches. The results from his observations will prove a most valuable contribution to science. Photograp1iy.-)Ir. J. A. Whippfo, of Bostou, directed the photographic operations, while Mr. George· D_ Clark, of Cambridge, co-operated with him, and bad charge of the mechanical adjustments of the Clark equatorial, to which the photographic apparatus was attached. This instrument is 7i feet focal length, has an aperture of 5i inches, and is provided with an excellent clock.-moYement. Fifty good negatives of the eclipse were obtained, three of which were taken dul'ing the total phase. .Arrangements which require no particular description here were made for recording upon the chronograph the time at which each negative was ta.ken. Lunar OO'll(acu and eccultatioos of solar ~u.-These were carefully observed by Mr. F. Blake, jr., a.id in the Coast Survey, and myself. The instrument 'used by me for this purpose is an achroma5ic refractor, which was made at Munich, and was formerly used as a finder on the great equa. torial a.t the Harvard College observatory. Its focal length is 4G inches, its aperture 3 inches, and on t!iis occaMion it was used with an amplifying-power of 30. The telescope was equatorially mounted and firmly adjusted upon a pine post, about 4! teet above the ground, and 20 feet west of the Shelbyville equaoorial, which was used by PrffeSSOr Winlock.· To avoid using very dark shade-glasses, the aperture was reduced t-0 one inch by placing a paper eap over the object-glass. Using a London smoke-shade of medium tint, I directed the telescope upon the so.n, near the point of the first contact, abont one minute before the first oontact was recorded. I fuiled t,o deteet any agitation at all of the.sun's limb, and the first indication of the moon's approoth was sbewn by the snn'e limb becoming suddenly rough, yet I hesitated to break the ebronograph-cirenit until I could perceive ·a slight indentation upoo the sun's limb, which, I think, must have been about ftve seconds after ~ first saw the serratied edge of the moon. A few seoonds after I had :roobrded tne first contact, Mr..Whipple obtained a. good photograph of it, and the exact time was~ upon the cbrou.ograph. During thirty or forty seconds after the first contact, the moon's edge appeared. remarkably

139

steady and sharply defined, its rough outline resembling very much that of a distant mountainrange. I was unable to discover that the moon projected beyond the sun. About ten minutes after the first contact the edge of the moon became tremulous, and so continued until the end of the eclipse. The occultations of the solar spots, the approximate relative positions of which are shown in the accompan,Ying rough sketch, were observed in the order as clcsignated by letters. .e Spot a being quite large, I observed two contacts of the umbra' (first and last), but all the other spots were observed at the instant of occultation. Immediately after recording the occultation of spot e, a ,·ery light shade-glass (London smoke) was substituted for the dark shade, and the paper cap was removed from the object-glass. After the occultation of spot f, the total phase of the eclipse seemed near "" ·a. at hand, and I watched closely for the first contact. A bout three ~ seconds before this was recorded, the delicate line of sun-light suddenly separated into minute fragments, resembling .-ery much a string of brilliants, which disappeared like snow under a white heat, producing one of the most brilliant and startling effects of the total eclipse. I have no doubt of the fact that the dark lines wliich I saw for three seconds before t-0tality were identical with the elevations that I saw upon the moon at the instant of first contact. Immediately after I had recorded the ftrst contact oi' totality, my attention was particularly directed to a large protuberance near the lower, or western edge, of the sun. :Fo(a few moments it seemed like a large coral formation, tinted with the most delicate pink and rose colors. As the eclipse progressed, several other similar formations appeared at different parts of the limb, a.11 of which, with the corona, have been successfully photographed by Mr. Whipple. During the totality I made a hasty survey of the heavens in the immediate vicinity of the sun, and also noticed the startling effect upon the Ja111lscape pro<lnce<l by the gloomy light from the corona. The planets Mercury and Venus and the star l':,egulus were seen without the least difficulty, and yet the degree of darkness during totality was not so great as I bad anticipated. I found but little difficulty in reading the notes that I had ma.de in pencil. Other observers near me were differentJy affeclied, and l\fr. Blake has stated in his report that he found great difficulty in reading large print. I noticed the gradual falling of the temperature tluring the. eclipse, and the sudden chauge of the wind from northeast to southeast, but at no time did I feel uncomfortably cold. .According to Mr. Te\'is's record, the change of temperature from the beginning until the close of the eclipse was only seven degrees Fahrenheit. I was successful in obtaining a good observation of the second inner co11.tact, or, in other words, the last contact of totality, but I failed to see the string of brilliants (Baily's beitds), as I saw them just before the beginning of totality. · About ten minutes after the total phase I observed a faint ollject pass across· the moon in a southwesterl.v direction; in a few moments I saw another, which ~as soon followed by another in the same general direction. Within fifteen minut.es I saw t.en of these faint objec,-ts pass across the moon. They bad the appearance of being meteors, and I am inclined to believe that they were. The same phenomenon was observed by Mr. Blake, and also by Mr. Alvan G. Cla1·k. The wind at that liime was very light frOlll th-e southeast. As my attention was required for other sen·iees, I made n-0 (.}bservati-Ons upon the solar spots as they re-appeared. The last eouta.ct of the moon was satisfactorily observed by l\fr. Blake aud myself, ood, iu a few hours afterward, the local time was carefully determiued from a series of observations upon qnith and Gireumpolar stars with transit No. 4, United States Coast Survey. Mr. Blake hu made a full report of his observatfons upon the e.clipse, which I have the honor to forward to you. ProfeSBOr C. B. Seymour, of Louisville, had the nise of a. small telescope belonging oo the

140

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Coast Survey (C. S. Ro. 24), aud made such observations upon the eclipse as he was able to do. The focal length of the telescope was 28 inches; its aperture, 2t inches; its power, 43. The instrn· ment was provided with a dark box, which Professor Seymour used in ma.king his observations. I herewith forward to you Professor Seymour's report of his observations. Sub-Assist:"tnt F. H. Agnew's impaired health prevented him from taking an active part in the eclipse observations, but he i·endered valuable services in attending to the chronographs, and obtained excellent records of all the observations which were made by Mr. Blake and myself during the progress of the eclipse. Meteorological observations were made every fifteen minutes during the progress of the eclipse by Robert C. Tevis, esq., of Shelbyville, who also rendered very acceptable services in making arrangements for the eclipse observations. The trustees of Shelbyville College placed several rooms in the college-buildings at our disposal, for storage of the instruments and equipments, and otherwise extended every facility in their power to aid the eclipse-party. To the Rev. Dr. Waller, Dr. Baker, Colonel W. C. Taylor, Colonel William Winlock, Joseph W. Davis, esq., and R. C. Tevis, esq., we were placed under many obligations for courteous attentions to the eclipse-party at Shelbyville. As your instructions contemplated the occupation of oue or more stations near the northern and southern limits of the shadow, Falmouth at the north, near the Cincinnati and Lexington Railroad, and Oakland at the south, near the Louisville and Nashville H.ailroad, were considered most fasorably located for this purpose, and arrangements were accordingly ma<le for having those stations connected hy telegraph for an hour during the eclipse. John Yan Horn, eRq., general superintendent of the ·westem Union lines, and Mr. William Biggart, superintendent of the railroad-lines, generously placed their wires at the disposal of the Coast Survey, and cheerfully extended all the telegraph facilities without charge. The eclipse-party at Falmouth was placed in charge of :Mr. Arthur Searle, of the Harvard College observatory, who, on the 5th of August, proceeded to cnmplete the re.qnisite arrangements at that plac<·. l\ir. Searle was fortm1atc in securing the services of several gentlemen at Falmouth, who kindly volunteered to aid him in making observations during the eclipse. The party was provided with two good telescopes, a dock-pendulum adjusted to sidereal time, two Morse registers, a stop· watch, and several other smaller instruments. The chief object of the observations near the north and south limits of the shadow was to determine the duration of the total phase, and, although Mr. Searle's efforts to obtain a good record of his obser\"'ations upon the Morse registers were not successful, he thinks that the observations made by Captain W. E. Arnold, of Falmouth, who was assisted by two tallymen, Messrs. :B. Johnson and D. Yelton, are worthy of confidence. The times noted by Captain Arnold gave forty-five seconds for the duration of totality, but he thinks that it was a small fraction of a second less. Captain Arnold's obser\'ations were confirmed by Mr. Woodson, who was a!'lsisted by a friend, using an ordinary watch. Mr. ·woodson thinks that the total phase continued exactly forty-five seconds. The station is located near the railroad and west of 'Vatl'lon's hotel, and was marked by a stake driven into the ground. Mr. R. W. Grant made observations on the first hill north of Falmouth station, using a stopwatch, and found the duration of the total phase to· be forty-one and six-tenths seco~ds. Judge Hudnall observed at the same station, using an ordinary_ watch, and made the time of totality a small fraction of a second greate.r than forty-one seconds. · At Catawba, a few miles north of Falmouth, the total phase wait observed by Mr. D. Crozer; jr., and ascertained to be twelve seconds. Mr. Crozer's observations were timed with an ordinary watch by his father i and Mr. St',arle reports that Mr. Crozer will at once mark the point by a stake. · The eclipse-party at Oakland, Kentucky, was in charge of Professor S. P. Langley, direet.or·f Alleghany Observatory, who was assisted by Graham Wilder, esq., and Mr. N. De Brie, of Louis· ville. The station at which the observations at Oakland were made is looatOO about ha.If a. mile west

of the railroad-station at that place, and twenty yards from the track. The point is to be marked by a large stone sunk into the ground. Professor Langley's party were provided with a good telescope, and a Bond chronograph-register from the Alleghany Observatory, a zenith-telescope for determining the latitude, a clock-pendulum, pocket-chronometer, stop-watch, and other smaller astronomical instruments. The unfavorable weather before the 7th of August pre.vented the latitude observations, but it was supposed, from the information obtained from the best maps\ that the station was at least two miles within the shadow. The observations of the totality appear to show that the observers were located just within the shadow. Professor Langley's observatfons were· made with a telescope having au aperture of three inches, and magnifyiug-power of thirty, and were recorded upon a Bond chronograph. These observations show that the duration of totality was one and seven-tenths seconds, but Professor Langley thinks it was not much longer than one second. l\ir. Wilder used a binocular field-glass, and his ouserrntious were recorded upon a Morse register fillet, and indicate a duration of two seconds. He, however, remarks, in his record, that, in bis judgment, the duration of to tali ts could not have been more than three-fourths of a second or one second. l\Ir. De Brie's record was not entirely completed, but in his record-book he remarks that, after recording the first contact ou the )forse fillet, he counted one beat of the pendulum, when.the sun re-appeared, and he thinks that the duration of the totality did not exceed one second of time. :Mr. De Brie used no glass in observing the contacts. Professor Langley remarks in his record that two observers, who we1·e stationed at Mr. Luther Carpenter's house, which is located near the railroad, about two miles west, and a little south of Oakland, were quite outside of the shadow of the eclipse. · · The Coast Survey is under obligations to all the gentlemen who took part in tl10 eclipse observations at Falmouth and Oaklancl, and my thanks, in behalf' of the Coast Survey, are due to John Yan Horn, esq., general superintendent of the Western Union Telegraph, and to ::.\Iessrs. Carter and Boyle, telegraph-managers at Louisville. ~Ir. Albert Stevens, of Cambridge, performed the duties of artificer at Shelbyville in the most faithful and acceptable manner. Very respectfully,

REPORT BY F. BLAKE, JR., UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY. . BOSTON, l\'1A.SSACHUSETTS, Tuesd<iy, August 2J-, 186tl. Sm : I herewith transmit a report of my observations of the total solar eclipse, made on the

7th instant, at the Coast Surv-ey station, Shelbyville, Kentucky. The morning of Saturday, August 71 1869, opened with a clouclless sky, and throughout the day the atmosphere was of a r-emarkable clearness. At 8 o'clock a. m., the mercury indicated a temperature of 590 Fahrenheit, it being the lowest reading I had made for at least two weeks. The morning was passed in makillg the necessary preparations for the afternoon's observations. Tue instrument used by me was the "Bowditch comet.seeker," belonging to the Harvard College observatory, the object-glass of which is 4 inches in diameter, and its focal length 3 feet; the power used was 34. This instrument was mounted upon a cedar post, about 70 feet south of the observa. tory, in which were placed the two chronographs and the break-circuit chronometer. The break·

circuit key at m~; instrument and the photographic apparatus attached to the Clark equatorial were in one cifo]lit; therefore, my observations of contacts and occultations were recorded by the Harvard chronograph upon the same sheet which cont~ins the record of the times at which the several photographs were taken. To facilitate the sketching of the apparent positions of the solar spots, I stretched four spider-lines across the diaphragm of the comet-seeker, dividing the field approximately into octants. A brass slide, in which were set a number of colored glasses of different shades, was attached to the eye-piece; and a pasteboaru cap, which reduced the aperture to about an inch and a quarter, was placed over the object-glass. A chart, showing the. positions of the planets and constellations at the time of totality, a small S('xtant, a few sheets of writing-paper, and a common watch, with which to note approximate times, were the only additional apparatus. The eye-piece of the comet-seeker is at the extremity of the horizontal axis, and, when observing, I sat with my face .to the north. 'l'he first exterior contact, as observed by me, is worthless. I was devoting my attention to a ~--~ portion of the sun's limb much belOw the point at which the contact .· ------~ took place, and did not break the circuit until some ten or twelve ::~:." seconds after the time at which Alvan G. Clark,jr., exclaimed, "There it is!" He was looking through the finder of the Shelby equatorial, and was probably the only member of the party who observed this \ eon tact. The moon had the appearance of a jet-black body projected / upon the bright imrface of the sun, its edge being slightly irregular. \. .e I am quite confident that the moon's limb was not visible until .b .e the contact actually-occurred. The moon';; uisk did not apparently 'd project beyond that of the sun. The accompanying sketch shows the approximate positions of the solar spots as they appeared through my instrument just after the ftrst exterior contact. The first spot (a) was 11uite large, and in observing it I made three breaks: one as the moon came in contact with the first edge; a second as it reachEJ9. the center of tho spot; and a third as the last edge disappeared. I have but little confidence in the observation on the center. After this occultation had been successfully observed, I could but notice the calmness of the observers an cl the smoothness and precision with which the different observations were made. ~\bout twenty-eight minutes before totality, the wind, which had been from the northeast, suddenly ceased. lu a few minutes, however, a breeze sprang up in the southeast and continued to hlow from that ~iuarter during the remainder of the day. At the same time I noticed that shadow,; were <1uite indistinct; that the air was growing chilly; and that the sun-light gave a pe~mliarly gloomy aspect to the landscape. The remaining spots (b, c, d, and e) were small, and but one tap was made on e,a.ch of them. They remained steady and undistorted up to the time at which they were occulted. Thirteen minutes before totality the air felt quite cold; the sun appeared as a beautiful crescent, while the black edge of the moon seemed to stand out from it, giving one the idea of a stereoscop~c picture. The shaking, or "running," of the moon's edge seemed to be rapidly increasing. Giving a hurried glance about me, I was struck with the appearance of the trees to the eastward of the tent and about 50 feet distant; the foliage was of a peculiar color, very similar to that produced by the electric light when displayed at night by Mr. Ritchie, of Boston, :Massachusetts. Eight minutes before totality, the limbs of too sun and moon were shaking violently, and the sun-light was diminished to such an extent that the faces of the observers were of a livid hue, not unlike that of a corpse. Facing to the eastward, I saw that the southern edge of my sha4ow was comparatively sharp and distinct, while the northern edge was ill-defined and very fa.int. The sun was now reduced t,o an extremely thin crescent, and I began to wateh for the :iirst, interior contact. A few momenta before totality I noticed a slight agitation in the upper portion of the crescent, which immediately afterward broke np into little detached masses of light, of very irregular ahapes and siz~, and a.t unequal distances from each other. This phenomenon, commonly known· as " Baily's beads," lasted bnt a few moments. These little point.s of light were rapidly extinpillhed; and as the la.st one, with the only remaining r&3' of BUD-light, was cnt oft', I made I\ break with the key, the ehronogra~hic record of which gives the time of the iirst interior eoD:taet.

THE UNITED STATES UOAST SURVEY.

'Vith the extinction of that last ray a startling change took place. The corona, of which, up to this moment, there had been positively no indications, now appear~d as an ..../"'\ extremely soft white light, surrounding the sun and extending from it, in all directions, to a distance of at lt>..ast two-thirds of its diameter. There was no appearance of rays, nor was there any sparkling light; it had, in fact, a perI fectly dead or "set" look. Its general form was irregular and somewhat J . similar to that of this rough sketch, which is copied from the one I made at the time. Simultaneously with the appearance of the corona, some of the planets and larger fixed star:< became visible to the naked eye. They did not appear as they ordinarily do at night, but seemed to shine with a Yery soft and slightly diffused white light. The sky, in the vicinity of the sun, was uot blue, as at night, but was of a peculiar milk_y hue; in the zenith it seemed to be of a pnrplisli tinge, and bad a more gloomy aspect; the eastern sky was lighted up with a lurid glare similar to that which sometimes attends an autumn sunset. I noticed several pink·colored protuberances ou the apparent right-hand limb of the sun and one Yery large one on the lower limb. Like the corona, they seemed to be devoid of life. The darkness was so great that it was impossible t-0 distinguish the foliage of trees a few rods distant, they being visible as dark bodies, the outlines of which were projected on the sk_y. At a distance of about one foot and a half I was unable to read the names of the planets upon the chart; on referring to it, I find they are of this size:

aj c\)

Venus.

Mars.

Mercury.

During the totality I felt quite uncomfortably cold, ancl was at first very nmch surprised ou finding that the mercury bad fallen but five degrees. I recollt>,cted, however, t&1t, as I had beeu fully exposed to the sun, in a place where the racliation was very great, it was quite probable that I had experienced a change of tem1lerature which would have caused the thermometer to fall thirty or forty degrees. After having devoted about two minutes to ob8Crvations of the general phenomena, I again sat down at the instrument and began to watch for the re-appearance of the sun. The edge of the moon ·surrounding the point at wl1ich the emersion was to take place gradually became brighter anrl brighter, until a single ray of sun-light burst fortlt, and, a break having been made wit.h the key, the observation of the last interior contact was accomplished. Soon after the re-appearance of the sun my attention was attracted to bright points of light, which were, froin time to time, passing across the field. After observing fifteen or twenty of them, I concluded that they passed between the earth and the dark body of the moon; that they always fell in the same direction, which was from the apparent upper limb of the moon to the horizon; that · their paths were straight lines, and parallel to each other; that one seen by i\'fr. A. G. Clark, jr., through a telescope, which was seven feet south and twenty feet east of my instrument, was also seen by myself; and that they were incandescent bodies. In size they were equal t-0 the smaUest stars Yisible through any telescope; about as large as a tenth or an eleve.nth magnitude star appears t-0 bt> in the Harvard College equat-Orial. As tbe sun-light increased these meteors ceased to be visible. As I was not looking through the telescope during the total phase, I am unable to say whether or not they were then visible. The time between the disappearance of the meteors and the laat exterior coutact being occupie(l iu writing out notes, no observations of the emersions of the solar spots were attempted. My work terminated with a very successfnl observa.tion of the la.st exterior eon tact, which was not acce>mpanie<l by any very striking phenome11a. The limbs of the sun and moon showe1l no signs of disrortion up to the instaut at which they separated. In the following table, which contains the results of my observations of precision, the chronometer-times are those which have been read directly from the chronograph-sheet; the true · sidereal times have been deduced from the chronometer-times by applying to -the latter the .1 t computed from time observations made with Coast Survey transit No. 6 clnring the morning preceding and the evening folli>win.g the eclipse.

Professor C. B. Seymour reports as follows : Immediately before the eclipse seven spots were visible. l\fy watch was not Yery accurate, so that the times are only approximate. Spot 2 was 1'rge and circular, about 1350 from the north point, and distant half a semi. diameter from the center. Spot 1, almost dne north of spot 2, and about 120° from the north point, was quite moderate in size. Spot 3, about 288° from the north point, not far from the center, was small. Spot 4 was at about the same angular distance, and twice as far from the center. Spots 5 and 6 were near together, and about three times as far from the center as 8pot 3, and very small, about 2800 from t11e north point, thus 3 4 5 fi Spot 7, about 2soo from the north point, was a longish oval, at about one-sixth of the semidiarneter from the edge of the sun. At 4h 27m 45· the contact was on a little distance. I failed t-0 see the instant of contact. At 4" 49'" 00' spot 1 disappeared. At 4h 51"' 03' c~nter of spot 2 was covered. At 5h 07m 30· spot 3 disappeared. At 5" 08m 00· spot 4 disappeared. At 5" 09"' 50- spot 5 disappeared. At 5" lOm 11' spot 6 disappeared. At 5h 24m 30' center of spot 7 disappeared. At 5h 26"' 20· beginning of total phase; beads appeared on the edge of the shadow. At 5' 2Sm 50' total phase had just ended; I failed to see the instant of end; beads were breaking up when first seen. During the total phase a kind of luminous, irregular twinkling was observed in the dark box on the paper, extending about 450 each side of the north point. I saw no protuberances on the paper. On raising my eyes to the sun, I saw a red protuberance near the north point and a larger one almost vertically below the sun's center. I saw Mercury and Vt>nus with the naked eye. An irregular corona surrounded the sun at totality. At 5h Um 55· center of spot 2 re-appeared. At 5· 42"' 00' spot 1 re.appeared. At 6h 04m 00' I observed a spot, from, which the moon's shadow had just passed, about 225° rom the north point. This l style spot 8. I bad not observed it before.

These observations were made upon the image of the sun's disk, cast through a telescope upon a sheet of paper, on which was a circle tfrvided into octauts. The lines in the telescope cast a shadow falling exactly on t!Je lim·s on the paper diyifling the octant.

D. O., October 4, 186\J. DEAR.Sm: The party for obsen·ing tlie solar eclipse of August 7, at Springfield, Illinois, acting under your immediate direction, and organized by me in accordance with your instructfons of June 25, consisted of the following members: h F. Pourtales, assistant, United States Coast Survey; Professor J. J\I. Peirce and J.B. 'IVarnPr, of Ilarvanl CollPge, stationed at Bloomington, Illinois, on the 7th; KI'. Seayer, R. A. J\IcLeod, 0. X. J<'ay, and 'IV. I'. l\lontagne, of Harrnrd College, temporary aids; .T. W. Black, assisted by R. Fitzgerald, photographers; and myself. The special duty assigned to the party was to obtain measures of precision of the contacts, and to make sueh collatrral obsPITatious of thP corona, promiuences, &<'., as tlte oat.fit of the party permitted. Prepar~tory to these obscrrntions, Mr. E. P. Austin determiucd, under Assistant E. Goodfellow's direction, the latitude and longitude of a station in the grounds of the new State-house. Between May 19 and June 6, on eight night8, sixty-five obserntions were taken on eighteen pairs of stars, with zenith-telescopA Coa!'!t SmTe,Y No. 5, for the dAtermination of tlie latitude.

On July 20, Assist.ant Goodfellow arrived at Springfield, auu on July !U, Assistant Pourtales; the latter selected a station in tl1e grounds of the reservoir, about one and one-fourth miles northea!lt of the center of' the city, favorably !lituated for observing the eclipse. lI nder Assistant Goodfellow's direction, an astronomical observatory was erected 10 feet by 12 feet, and 7 feet high at the eaves; Trough ton anu Simms's transit, Coast Survey No. 6, was mounted on two blocks of seasoned pine; the Krille clock was mounted on a post; and chronograph Coast Survey No. 2 (by Bond) was set up. A Daniell battery of tllree cups was kindly loaned bj' tl1e ·western Union Telegraph office. On my arrival at Springfield, on tlte 28tlt, the observatory was enlarged to meet the wants of the photographers; a dark chamuer, 4 feet by 10 feet, was auded on the WllSt side; also sufficient cov· ered space for. mounting and working the lar15e equatorial.

On the nights of the 6th and 7th time-signals were sent to Des Moines, Iowa. Transits of solar spots, according to Carringt-011's method, were obser>ed on several days, but, owing to the want of fine motion and means of adjnstmeut of equatorial )I u. 41 and a troublesome wind, these obserYations arc not so aeeurate as the method admits of wllen under favorable circumstances. The photographic pictures of the cclip~e were obtained by means of an eqnarorially mounted (on a Smeaton block) refractor by Dollond, hadug about Gk feet focal length and a clear aperture of 4 inches. The instrument was adjusted so that IJy merely turning the handle of the motion in right ascension the image of the i:;uu could be kept near enough in the middle of the field during the total duration of the eclipse. The use of photograph,\· at the Springfield station was decided on but a short time before tlle eclipse, atHl was much restricted for want of clock-motion in the telescope, and also for want of a suitable e.yc-piece. il'he images of the sun, as formed by the o~ject lens, are nearly two-thirds of an inch in diameter. The pictures were taken iustautaueousl,r, and the times recorded automatically on the chronograph. The attachment of the plate-holder and the slide and circuit-breaking arrangement is due to l\lr. mack. The drop-slide had a rectangular adjustable opening of about one-twelftll of an inch, and passed ornr the diaphragm of the telescope in a small fraction (:/11) of a second. The telescope was directed by means of the finder, which, in the place of the eye-piece, was closed with a ground glass, having a circle marked on it. When the image of the sun was kept within this circle, the telescope war 1woperly directed and the solar image was central on the plate. Each plate was arranged for five pictures, which, on the average, were taken within an interval of about nine seconds. When the middle of the opening was opposite the cenrer of the solar image, the lower e~d of the slide separated two slender brass springs (a, a.) in connection with the galvanie c!t'cnit, and broke the circuit; about one-tenth of a second later

the circuit was restored by a metallic plate insertml in the woode~ slide (near b) coming in contact with the springs. l~or each picture exposed there are two marks on the chronograph-one produced by the 11p-motion of the slide, while the plate is covered; and one produced by the dou:nz _jb) motion; the former being larger and useful as a finder for the latter. During total_, ity the slit was opened to the full size of the picture, but, as the photographs show, the sun was but ver~- imperfectl~- followed by hand, makiug a series of superimposed pictures, from 'l\"hich, nevertheless, some useful information may be gathered. After totality, the circuit became, from some cm1se, uisarranged, and iuterruptcd for a few minutcEl" tile regularity of the operation. Assistant Ponrtales titned the pictures; :Mr. Black att@f1ed t,o the Rli<le and exposure; 1\Ir. Fitzgerald kept the telescope directed; while two attendants in the dark room, directly back of the telescope, did the coating and dcYeloping, and fIXiug of the plates. In itll, 52 plates were secured, throwing Ollt those taken before and after the edipsc, and some on which an attempt was made to let the snn trace out a declination-parallel to sern for the measure of position-angles. After this deduction, 38 remain, containing 178 pictures of phases and 6 pictures during totalit,y. As some time must necessarily elapse beforn tlte measures of the photographic pictures (glass negative<1) can be takeu and discussed, I 11ropose 1:-0 submit a special (and Rnpplementary) report of these results, in order not, to delay the present general account of our labors. The weather ""a~ remarkably fayorable; the cloudy and rainy weather of the two preceding days basing changed dming the night, and on tlie day of the eclipse the sun was clear and no cloud wai-; to uc seen. There was a light wind from the northeast. It waR also fortunate that the dust of the preceding dry period had all disappearefl. Meteorological observations were taken by Mr. T. Dudley, a Smithsonian obBerver, who had kindly Yolunteered his services. His record iR given further on. My observatiom; of the con tads arn.l of the general progress of the eclipse were made with the zenith-telescope already mentioned. It, bas a cle~u aperture of 3.65 inches, and a focal length of 4 feet 2 inches. Tbe magnifying power used was about 6.'i, the lowest available. A deep-red shadeglass was fastened oyer the im·erting eye-piece. The high power aml t_he presence of micrometer rack and tb'reads made the nse of the instrument less convenient. J\ir. Seayer used the small equatorial, also employed by me in the solar-Rpot observationR. Its a11erture was 2.7 inches; focal distance, 3 feet 10 inches; and magnifying powet·, about fi5. No shade-glaRs was required, as the suu's image was spread 011 the disk to a circle of' 4~ inches in diameter. The instrument was balanced and roughly adjusted, but for want of fine motion was troublesome to handle. Mr. Fay observed with telescopes of one and two inch opening, an(L l\Ir. l\IcLeod with a binocular marineglass, magnif;ving two or three times. These observers used red shade-glasses. · The contacts were noted as follows, Mr. Montague calling out the half and whole seconds of the chronometer (Dent 2171):

The obscrYcd time of bt·giuning must be considered liable to a proba blc error of seYcml seconds, and is most likely too late ; the times of the other place8 are considered quite trustworthy. An independent set of times, of greater Yalue it is expected, will be deduced from the photogra1ihs. It ruay also be stated here that the nearest point in the line of centrality of shadow, as computed from the American Ephemeris, was 0'.7 N. 320 E. from the eclipse-station; according to th« data from the English Nautical Almanac, however, this distance was 3'.0, in the same direction. The elevation of the station abov-e the sea-level I estimate at about 500 feet. The contact of the moon's limb with the umbra of spot 4 lsee solar spot.diagram further on) was observed as follows: h. m. b, First contact occurred, by chronometer 2171. at 5 19 45.5, C. A.

In connection with this observation I noticed a curious and unexpected phenomenon. When the moon's limb had nearly touched t~e penumbra of the spot, a black band t suddenly shot out _ from the umbra (and of the same width), and for an instant was connected with the moon's limb; it then retreated and re-formed, making apparently a bridge across the penumbra; it was then gradually shortened and covered by the advancing moon. This connection was distinctly seen for aeveral second1>, though each forming, retreating, and re-forming was, perhaps, completed in half a second.

The above disappearances were also noted by Mr. Seaver, together with re-appearances; for which see his report. During the progress of the eclipse, the moon's outline was tolerably smooth, and the points of the crescent were perfectly sharp.* The phenomenon of Baily~s beads was seen to great perfection for a few seconds before totality set in, but its existence just after totality was not ascertained, the time being consumed with fixing my shade-glass. The accompanyiug diagram shows the .i beads, as seen through the inverting telescope. The arrow ini:licates iI the direction of their successive formation ; the two up12er ones were formed last. I would particularly notice their great regularity in width, outline, and distribution. Their individual shape is given in the <>,Orner of the diagram. The phenomenon was seen, both before and after totality, by others of the party, and is described in their reports.

In the accompanying sketch (Plate No. 25, Fig. 8), I have tried to produce a faithful picture of the corona and prominences during totality. lt is drawn, relatively, to scale and the coloring is that seen hy me. The corona appeared white, with the slightest mixture of a very faint ambel'-colored warmer tint, and the prominences of a bright red. The relative darkness of the sky and moon is preserved. The various directions given on the margin are the result of a computation. The position of the prominences are from our photographs, and the outline of the corona from the experienced pencil Baily's beads before totality. of Mr. F. B. Meek, of the geological survey of Illinois, who kindly con11ented to attend to this phenomenon. (Plate No. 25, Fig. 9.) In general, the outline of the corona was quite well defined, and to some presented five, to others, perhaps the majority, four cusps or brushes of light. It was striated and extended all round the covcl'ed sun; to the naked eye the maximum extent of the bundles of ra~·s was nearly three-fourths of the sun's radius, but, in general, the col'onal development was no greater than about one-fifth of the radius. The accompanying sketch (Plate No. 25, Fig. 10) is intended t:o exhibit the symmetrical relation of the corona to the sun's equator. There are two (principal) bundles of ray!'! to the west in about 520 heliographical north and south latitude, and two (principal) bundles of rays to the east in about 32° north and south latitude, with a feebler development of rays between the latter and over the equatorial region. The rays do not converge to the sun's apparent center. The large prominence, near the lowest point of the sun, was seen first with the naked eye, and was the only one remaining visible throughout theJotality. Those Qn the eastern limb appeared immediately after totality set in; two of those were separate from_the rest, which consisted of two large patches of intensely bright light of a white color; whereas .all other prominences were of a tlelieate pink. When the three prominences on the western )imb had become fully unco,-ered by the retreating moon, all traces of those on the eastern limb were gone. A few seconds before the end of totality, a long, narrow ridge of reQ.-colored; mat~r, united _the largest and lowermost prominence with the next one to the westward. On_tbe following limb the chromosphere was whiter than on the preceding limb; its thickness on the latter I estimate at less than half a minute, and widest in the middle of its extent. The elevation of.·the lower prominence was· about 1'.8 i somewhat less than three turns of the micl'()meter.
·The phenomena of distortion, noted by Mr. McLeod, I therefore attribute to the imperfection of his ma.rine-gl&l!l!.

what closer description and scrutiny; of those examined by me, after the midddle of totality and within half a minute of its close, they were all on tlte preceding limb. The largest prominence, opposite the >ertex, No. 1 of the drawings, resembled a cumulus cloud, with delicate, deeper markings or fringes within the mass; it showed also patches of lighter color. No. 3 was of a remarkable shape, resembling the outstretched wings of a bird, with shading giving them a solid appearance. As the moon uncovered more of its stem, markings of a twisted form became visible, together with a smaIIer projection. It seemed as if gases had been ejected, had rooclied their highest point, and had commenced to sink. No. 4 showed the form of a gas-flame; its outlineii were composed of straight lines, and the central jet appeared of the sharpness of a needle. Its surface seemed fiat, as if gas was issuing through a narrow longitudinal slit, having three wider openings. With the exception of a slight, yet distinct, quivering, especially in forlll No. 3, no motion was noticed in these objects. Prominence No. 4 was perhaps the most recent, next No. 3, and last No. 1, in wliich the gases had already fully spread out. The prominences on the eastern limb I did not sketch, as my eyes were somewhat affected by the long use of the telescope, and required o>er half a minute before I was :ible to clearly note tha appearance of the corona, and take a look at the heavens and landscape in general. 'Vhen return· ing to the telescope I occupied myself with the above sketches. In the region of the hea·ens between northwest and northeast, there appeared a tolerably well defined line of separation of color about 150 above the horizon, and, as I am informed, extending all around the southern horizon; above this line the dark·bluish, threatening tint of the sky, ~nd below it a dirty yellow tint, very strongly marked;"" here we evidently see through the entire width of the shadow, and the good definition of this chromatic portion of an almucantar would seem to deserve more att~mtion. The landscape had much the appearance of being lit by the full moon, with the addition of a greenish coloring, which gave it a peculiarity distinct from that of a moon-light night; the darkness was not so great as to interfere with coarse writing, or the reading of large t.nle; we used no artificial. light, though provided fur in case of need. Personally, I only noticed .Mercury and Venus, but I only scrutinized the region close to the moon. Not to make this report of too great length, I only communicate the results of the solar-spot observations.

The number 1 in the column of wind indicates a very light breeze, and 2 a gentle breeze. After 9h no cloud was noticed. The direct effect of the eclipse on the temperature of the air in the 8hade was a depression of nearly 50; the wet-bulb thermometer was depressed about 10; the atmospheric pressure was not notably affected, and a gentle breeze at the beginning of the eclipse changed into a very light one toward its end, preserving its direction from the northeast.

REPORTS OF GENTLEMEN ATTACHED TO THE SPRINGFIELD PARTY

Report of Professor .J. 11L Pe.free.
SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS,

August 9, 1869.

SIR: I left this place on the 7th instant, accompanied by Mr. J.B. \Varner, for the purpose <>f observing the solar eclipse at Bloomington. We arrived there about half past two in the afternoon, and, after a necessarily hasty reconnaissance, selected the platform on the roof of the new store-house of the Chicago and Alton Railroad, as a position easily identified, and in other respects well suited to our pu!'poses. The building is of stone, now unfinished, on the west of the track, and just north of the machine-shops belonging to the road. ·we were assisted in securing possession of this platform by John A. Jaekman, esq., superintendent of machinery of the Chicago and Alton Railroau, to whom we are indebted for various kind offices in our behalf. We were provided with a binocular marine· glass belonging to the Coast Survey. This was attached to the west balustrade of the platform. J\Ir. Wamer had also a good opera-glass with dark screens. Oar chronometer was Parkinsou & Frodsham No. 14Ll. We had, also, a stop-watch. In t11e observation of the several contacts, and of most of the other phenomena of the eclipse, I used the glass, while Mr. Warner read the clironometer and noted the time at my call. 'l'he chronometer was at first read audibly, and both 1\Ir. 'Varner and myself noted the instant of my first call (at the beginning of the eclipse), but it was afterward judged best to leave the estimate of the time wholly to Mr. Warner. We were instructed that the principal object of our observations was to determine the times of inner·contact. We obtained them a11 follows: First inner contact, 12h 32m 19·.9; second inner contact, 12h 34"' i6·.0; giving for. the duration of totality, 1ro 56·.l. Mr. Warner felt great confidence in the accuracy of his estimate of both these times as given by my call. I believe that the latter of the two observations may be relied on ~s very accurate. In the former case, I think my call was half a second late, but two bystanders, hearing me express this opinion, declared that I had spoken "full early."

Mr. Jackman helcl the istop-1rntch during the total phase, :;tarting it and stopping it at my call. The indication of the duration was pn 56'.8 or 5G·.9. The estimated correction for the error in stopping this watch is -0'..J. I vrns unable to make accurate determinations of the times of outer contact. My calls indicat~d them as follows: }i'irst outer contact, 11 11 3lru 53".5; second outer contact, 13h 2!)m 40.·5; giving for t,he duration of eclipse, l1' 57m 47'.0. The former of these times is probably 10· too late. I suspected the indentation in the sun's limb at the call of 48·, and I believe that it existed several seconds earlier. This determination was matle almost immediately after we had got our glass and chronometer into their positions, and before I was able to arrange myself in a co1n·enient attitude. The end of the eclipse may have taken place at 131< :.llJm Ul'.5 when I first called it. Tbe recordecl time indicates the moment at which the tremulousness of the sun's limb appeared to ceaRc. One large solar spot, near the lower limh of the sun, was visible with my glass. This spot waR hisectecl by the moon's adyanced limb at 1111 53m 53".9 and by the following limb at 1211 4!Jm 00'.0. We took note of a few general phenomena, to "11hich it may be proper to refer, without ascribing to them scientific value. Six minutes after t4.e beginning of the eclipse (at 1111 3Sm,), I thought that the moon's limb could be traced ueyoml the sun. At a laier time this observation was doubted, but it was again made. 22m Lefore totalit~· (at 121i mm), and again 2om after totality (at J21l 5Jm). Eighteen minutes before totality (at 12h 14m), the truncation of the cusps, especially of the lower cusp, was pointed out by :Mr. ·warner. This was afterward seen by both of us to be more apparent with the feeble glass than with the stronger. Twelve minutes befom totality (at 12h 20m), the light on tlie landscape seemed ghastly and of a bluish-green color i hut, at 1211 3om, it ha<l become yellow and resembled unnaturally brilliant moon-light. 'l'lie shadows were strongly defined, and the whole landscape presenterl a remarkable and beautiful aspect. In casually glancing at the bystanders, I was struck by the pallor of their faces, but I have not noted at which of the two times just mentioned I observed this phenomenon. The total phase came on vdth startling suddenness, and the end of totality was likewise marked by an instantaneous change in· sky aml lamfacape. But I was unal>le to see the limit of the shadow moving over the ground: During totality, the sky was of a violet blue above, while it was lurid near the horizon, at auy rate, in the north. The spectacle was of an indescribable beauty, and one for which the mind was by no·means prepared by the more and more rapid succession of aspects preceding the period of coml)lete obscuration. The moon bad not to my eye the spherical look which is a;;;cribed to it in some accounts of total eclipses. It resembled rather a black, jagged wafer, a portentous blot in the midst of the brightness the corona. '.l.1he corona impressed me as distinctly cruciform, tlic principal projections occurring near the north, south, east, and west points. But these projections had not the character of rays, such as are s~en in the phenomenon called "the sun drawing water," but were irregularly curled, the whole resembling somewhat the corona occasionally seen in the aurora borealis. The light of the corona seemed to me pearly w11ite, lint Mr. ·warner thought it had a warmer color. W.e saw two protuberances, which I noted as gold-colored. \Ve marked these independently in nearly the same places, that is, at about moo and 260° from the vertex (counting through east , and &>nth). We had no means of making measurements of the corona and the protuberances. Thirteen minutes aftt~r totality (at 12h 47m), Venus was still seen by a bystander. . At the beginning of the eclipse, the wind blew freshly from the east, and was quite troublesome to us in our exposed position. But ism after totality (at 12h 52m), we noticed that it had entirely died away, and we thought that this change had taken place some 2om before totality. I was provided with two sets of screens, one of a very deep green, and a lighter one of red ; but I fonnd it imposSible to use the lighter glass at any time during the eclipse. The attempt to use it just before the beginning of totality disconcerted me and caused the already-mentioned doubt of the accuracy of my observatiou nf the first inner contact. The total phase was observed without" a screen. AU which is respectfully submitted. J. M. PEIRCE.

Srm:'fGFIELD, ILLINOIS, .1lugu8t u. lSGU. Sm: I was directed to accompan.r Professor J. M. l'eirce to Bloomington for the purpose of assisting in observations on the total eelipse of August 7, and accordingly left this place at noon on the clay of the eclipse. I was instructed to note "'itlt a chronometer tl1e times of contact, and to notice such other phenomena as I had opportunity to obserYe. The times, as 1 observed them, have l.Jeen communicated to Professor J. ::II. Peirce, wllo reports to ;yon. I think that they were obtained with considerable accuracy, particularl,y the time of the secoml inner contact, which I was able to get with precision. Tlle difterence of 0".7 or os.s in the estimates of the duration of totality, as obserYed by the stop-watc~ and the chronometer, is, I think, to a great degree, to be accounted for by the imperfection of the former instrument, which J1ad been olJserved before this occasion to mark au error of at least 0".5. The general etfocts of the eclipse were extremely grand aucl illlpressi' e, aml from our elevated position could be well observed. I was provided only with an opera-glass, and this I used but seldolH. There was little change in the light during tlte half-l1our after tlte first contact, but objects began to assume a somewhat greenish an<l. very gloomy hue; and, during the fi\e minutes immediately before the second contact, the light was very weird and strange, giyiug an unearthly hue to the landscape as it lay outstretched bencatlI us. The shadows had the cold, unreal appearance of moon-shadows, and the whole effect on the mind \Yas chilling·. The cusps of the snn, especially the low Pr on(', apprared truncated. M,y glass was not of sufticient p1mer to show the ellge of the moon serrated, nor did it bring out at all the dark limb of the moon. A bout a minute and a half l.Jefore the secornl contact, Venus ap11eared, and J\fercur,y soon followed. On the instant when the last ray of light \'l'::lS intercepted, the country assumed a hue yet more strange and awful, a,n<l. it was impossible to prcyent a sort of dread from seizing on the mind. The black disk of tlle moon a1>peared edged with a silver rim of great brilliancy, which was withiit the corona and far excelled it in brightness. Tlie corona seemed to me of a whitish, perhaps slightly green, color; an<l had a rolling, curliug motion like smoke. Streamers issued from it in several directions, but my attention was principally held by t].le ,waving band slightly west of the Yertex, which seemed to me to he most active and conspicuous, and which waved to\vard the Yertex. I cannot tell how many of these streamers there were, or what their arrangement was. O.n first looking up from the chronometer, my e,yc was takeu with two very bright projections from the black disk, which seemed of an orange color. The l:ugest of these was at about l'iOC (toward the right) from the vertex; the smaller at about 1000. l had been provi<l.ed with a chart of the stars in the vicinity of tlte suu but "·as too much occupied with the corona to search for them. I noticed, however, that Hegulus did not shine out, as I had expected, between Ven us and the snu. The darkness was not deep, and I think that I could have dispensed with the lighted lantern which stood by the chronometer. llefore the light had become faint I had fixed. on a new unpainted slied, which was about thirty-five rods distant, and I found that I coukl descry its yellow shingles during the total phase. Along the southern horizon there lay what seemed a cloud (though no cloud was perceptible in the sky before or after totality), colored bright orange, stretching away 'toward tlte cast). The town below us was perfectly quiet during the darkness, though Yery noisy immediately before and after. Venus continued to shine brightly after the sun had re-appear~, and was watched for thirteen minutes by bystanders. The phenomena of the de.parture of the moon were similar to those of its approach. We were informed by people of the town that a yery peculiar doubling of shadows had been observed just before and after the total phase when the sun was reduced to a crescent, but these we had no opportunity to observe. As I could allow my attention to be diYerted from the chronometer onlr a minute and a lialf, lhad no opportunity to make many or accnrate observations. Respectfully, JOSEPH B. WAmrnn. CHARLES A.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Rep01·t of .lJir. E. P. Seaver.
SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, Augu.~t 7, 186!).

Sm: I have respectfully to report the following observations made by me during the total eclipse of the sun, August 7, 1869, at Springfield, Illinois: I. The instrument used by me was a reconnoitering-telescope, C. S. No. 4, mounted equatorially, and provided with a oomera. '.!. The disk of the sun projected upon the screen was 4i inches in diameter, and displayed several distinctly-marked solar spots, which were def\ignated by the numbers 4, 4a, 5, 61 7, 7!, 8, and 9. Numbers 4 and 9 were much larger than the others, and exhibited well-defined umbrru and penumbr~. The others appeared to be about as large as dots made by a common lead-pencil on the screen, and their contacts with the limb of the moon coultl be noted with great accuracy, but their re-appearances could not be so well ascertainea., and only two were noted. 3. The first external contact of the sun and moon was noticed at 4h 5501 28·;"' but the actual contact must have occurred some seconds earlier, for there was a decided indentation of the sun's limb before I was sure of the fact of contact. This delay arose partly from the inherent difficulty of observing s~on enough such a contact and partly from the fact that the contact actually occurred at a point on the sun's disk about 30° from where I had expected to see it. Judging from my subsequent observation of the rate of progress of the moon's limb over the sun's disk, I am certain that 6· should be Rubtracted from the time given above, and that the time of actu:;il contact wa8
4h 55m 22·,

4. Contact of 4a occurred at 5i. rnm 20'. The first of the three minute spots which compmied 4a was the one observed. 5. Contact of the umbra of 4- occurred at jh mm 43".u. Disappearance of the umbra of 4 occurred at 511 2oru 2!8.5. 6. As the spot 4 a1iproached the limb of the moon, it seemed to grow fainter, and, between the two epochs noted above, it gradually melted away, so that the disappea.rance was not well defined, and the observation was not very satisfactory. 7. Contact of spot 7 occurred at 5h 35m rn·.5. This was not a very satisfactory observation. 8. Contact of spot 7~ occurred at 5h 3710 43·. This was a satisfactory observation. This spot was much more clearly defined than it had been in the forenoon. 9. Contact of spot 8 occurred at 5h 39m 20·.5. Satisfactory. 10. At 5i. 46m shadows were defined on the grass with startling distinctness. The light was of a hard: cold, gray-blue color. The air felt decidedly chilly. 11. At 5h 50ru 50· the lower cusp of the sun's disk appeared to be forming a bead in a manner resembling a drop of water forming at the end of a straw. This phenomenon lasted about 20·. I did not notice it again, though I looked for it frequently. 12. Spot 9 bisected, as shown in the figure, by the moon's limb at 5h 53m 52·.5. The figure also shows acurately the form of the penumbra of 9 at this moment. It was. well clefined. 13. Beginning of the total phase occurred at 5h 55m 56·.5. 14. As the crescent grew very thin, beads began to form at each end, little black ,~lines with sharp ends apparently shooting from the moon's disk in a radial direction across the thin crescent and chopping it into beads. At last the crescent was reduced to a string of beads about an inch and a half long, which trembled for an instant and then suddenly disappeared. The disk of the moon was faintly irradiated near the bead!l while they were visible, and for a time (I should say 15·) after they di@appeared. The beads were not globular, but diamond-shaped, from an apparent adhesion to each other and ro the limbs of the sun and moon. They were exceedingly bright, particularly at the points of adhesion.

Report of Mr. R. A. McLoorl.
AUGUST 8, 1809. Sm: The instrument with which I observed the solar eclipse of August 7 was a binocular marine-glass, magnifying two and one-half times. It was furnished with red shade-glasses so dark that the features of the landscape were invisible through them on a bright day. The power of the glass was such that in looking with it at the largest spot on the sun, on the day of the eclipse and two days before, the shape of the spot was distinctly defined, but the smaller spots were not discernible. The instrument was secured to a :firm. stand, and had moYement in altitude and azimuth. I bad been directed, in estimating lengths, to take the sun's diameter as a unit. At 4h 55m 21·, by chronometer Dent 2171, I observed the first outer contaet. It was instantaneous, but occurred at a point from 50 to 100 higher than where I had expected it. immediately

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OP

before the contact 1 noticed no agitation of the sun's limb, nor could I perceirn at all the approaching moon. During the llrogress of the eclipse the large spot near the sunls lower limb seemed at some times much darker ancl more distinctly defined than at others, but I made no accurate obsen·ations upon it. At 4h 30"1,'_Springfield mean time, the upper cusp appeared distorted . .At 4h 35m, Springfield mean time, the blue of the sky overhead had become perceptibly darker, whil(along the east horizon the tint seemed unusually light. At 4h 3Sm, Springfield mean time, the lower cusp appeared as in accompanying figure. At 4h 55m, Springfield mean time, the sky 011 the western horizon was of a very light azure, but the color deepened gradually as the eye followed it up toward the zenith, where the blue was ntense. The shadows of objects near me, as thrown on the ground, were peculiarly soft. The water of a pond near by looked Yery black. The woods, 400 or 500 yards distant, presented a -~-> singular appearance. Beneath them the gloom was strikingly deep, while the tree-tops seemed of a lighter green than usual. The sun's light had a bluish tint, making the faces of those who were near me appear ghastly. The general effect of the light sug· gested that produced by bright moon-light. I observed the extinction of the last solar ray at 511 55m 55~s, by chronometer, one portion of the crescent being separated from the rest by a dark line. It then broke up into small fragments, which disappeared quickly, one after the other, the lowest one going first, and the final extinction . being somewhat above the center of the line of beads as at first seen. Up to the time of total immersion I had not seen the preceding limb of the moon, but the next instant I perceived its jagged edge in relief against a faint red glow surrounding it. The glow grew brighter every moment, and soon appeared as a band all around the moon. I at once removed my shade-glasses and saw the same aspect of the moon for .an instant with my naked eye. Upon returning my eyes to the glass I found the corona and the accompanying rays already visible in all their brilliancy. (Plate No. 25 1 Fig, 12). It is from a sketch roughly made, perhaps 10 seconds after my :first sight of this beautiful phenomenon. At this moment the corona was brightest on the upper part of the following side, in the space between two points, 300 and soo from the vertex. D and E in Fig 12 represent what looked like two mountains of light, being apparently portions of the corona itself, not differing from the rest of it at all in color, but being. much brighter. D and E were entirely unlike the protuberances in appearance. The corona's width in this part appeared to be about -f6 , but this estimate is quite · uncertain, as I could perceive no sharply-defined exterior limit to the corona; but, from an intense brilliancy close to the moon's edge, it gradually softened away into faint fringe-like rays. The color. of the corona, where it was brightest, was pure white, but its dimmer portions partook of a golden tinge. I remarked, about a minute later, t.hat the corona's brightness on the following side had diminished. At the time of my sketch only three protuberances were visible. Their estimated distances from the vertex were; A, 175°; B, 115°; C, 1000. Of these, A was by far the largest, and its shape was very decided to my eye. I was struck by its solid appearance. It looked not like a flat jet of flame, but like a solid conical body. Its length was about one-eighth, and it was of a rosy color. I did not notice B and C with much care, but observed the contrast of their pale rosy tint with the white of the corona. One of them had the shape given in the annexed .~_,,.- filgnre, but which one I omitted to-record, and cannot say with· certainty. I did ---\._~ not notice the appearance afterward of any protuberances on the preceding side, my attention being diverted to other features. From the outer rim of the corona, bright white :rays emanated on ev-ery side, but their lengtll \Yas greatest in four directions, as represented in Fig. 12. Tbe four arma of rays were of unequal length, F being by far the longest, G the shortest, and H and I of about equal length. I took especial pains to estimate the length of F, and could trace it to the distance of nearly two

159

diameters of the moou. The angle of the axis of F with the vertical was about 20°. This angle did not change with a slight motion of my glass. The end of the longest ray was slightly curved · toward the vertical. During the total phase, I noticed se\~eral fiashes or tremors of light across the corona, apparently in a radial direction from the center out. The moon did not present that inky blackness which I bad expected to see, but was much lighter. Glancing for a moment at the landscape, I found that the darkness was much less than that of a starlight night. The appearance of the sky was as if a blackish-blue hemispherical cover were hanging down from overhead, its rim reaching to within about 12° of the horizon. Between this rim and the horizon, to tlle north and as far around as I looked, the sky was of a dusky yellow. Shortly before the end of the t-0tality, the corona and rays had faded away from the preceding limb of the moon, on which my attention was now fixed. At 5h 53m4~·, by chronometer, a red band became visible around that limb, crossed here and there by dark lines, which were continually changing their position. One line did not seem to undergo any change except to grow broader and darker as the moment of emcrsion approached. It was very near the point where the sun re-appeared. I observed the second inner contact at 5h 5sm 43~·, by cLronometer. The l'mn's re-appearance seemed more sudden to my unprotected eye than his disappearance had seemed, viewed through the shade-glasses. The effects on the landscape produced by the increasing light as the moon passed off the sun's disk were by no means so striking as those produced before the totality by t!Je diminishing light. This fact was doubtless owing to the different condition of my eyes in the two cascA. I observed the second outer contact at Gh 54m 7~·, by chronometer. Respectfully, HOBERT A. 1\IcLEOD.
lifr. CIIARLES A. SCHOTT.

NoTE.-In regard to the distortions of the cusps, it should be borne in mind that the appearances which I observed and have sketched were those presented to my eye by a comparatively weak and very darkly-shaded glass. I have since that time seen photographic pictures taken at various stages of the eclipse, and, in llerhaps every case, the cusps are sharp and undistorted. Observers, also, with powerful glasses, have perceived no distortion. On the other hand, t11e distortions have been qujte uniformly seen by observers with simple opera-glasses. l\fy own attention was first called to the appearance given on page 158, upper figure, by l\fr. Montague, who was looking at the titne through a small transit-instrument. The explanation of these facts is perhaps as follows : The sun's disk, as is v.-ell known, presents to us a surface, the brightness of which is by no means the same in e\'ery part, arn:t the difference in brightness of adjacent parts is, as in the case of the Jacula:, most percc1Jtible near the edge of the visible disk. Accordingly, during the progress of an eclipse, a cusp, retreating along the rim of the disk, frequently reaches points where the inequality of tho solar light for small adjacent portions of the disk is >ery great. The dark body of the moon on one side of the narrow strip of the crescent near the cusp, and empty space, on the other, shield the eye from the usual glare, and enable it to appreciate the peculiarities of the strip. Under these circumstances, it is only the brightest portions of the strip (the tops, probably, of the waves of the luminous solar envelope) which emit enough light t-0 be visible through glasses of small size or furnished with very dark shade-glasses, the darker portions (the hollows, probably, between the waves) appearing black; while the sensitive paper in the camera, or the eye of an observer who looks through a powerful glass or through one lightly shaded, receives light from the darker as well as the brighter portions of the strip, and sees the outlines of the cusp complete. Accordingly, accurat-0 observations of the distortions of the cusps might,give interesting information in regard to the shape of the surface of the luminous solar envelope.

160

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Perhaps a similar explanation may l>e given of the very different shapes of the same solar protuberances as seen through different glasses. The outlines given by weak glasses are probably the outlines of the densest and most lumin@us parts, while those given by glasses of higher power inclose also a certain portion of the more rarified gaseous matter surrounding the inner and denser' part-the size of the portion increasing with the power of the glass. A comparison of the shapes given by different glasses may, therefore, show the comparatfre densities of different portions of the protuberance.

Report of O. N. Fay, aid in obsen:ing eclipse of August 7, 18G9, at Springfield, Illinois.

I arrived in Springfield 011 Wednesday, the 4th, at Gp. m. From Wednesday to Saturday l spent the time in visiting the station and in making preparations. I succeeded in borrowing a sevenfoot refractor, with two inches aperture, from llfr. 'Watson, of this place, who was the maker, and is an amateur obserrnr. On Saturday I set up ·this" instrument, and also a transit-instrument borrowed from the city-surveyor. I set up for them a seat aud rest sufficient to accommodate two persons. At 4h 50'n, Washington mean time, the time-keeper began to call. I used the small transit just mentioned. 'With this instrument of about one inch aperture and ten inches focal length, magnifying some twenty diameters, I saw the first contact at 41t 55rn 188 .3.* I suspected the contact at least one second before recoruing it. I saw no limb of the moon before the contact. I saw no disturbance of the sun's limb before contact. After contact I left the transit-instrument in order to adjust the refractor above mentioned. I observed the cusps with this refractor and also with the transit. I had my attention called to the irregularity in the lower cusp, but I failed to see it. I noticed no agitation iu the cusps. I noticed the light at about 5h 4om; it was sickly, and, in effect, resembled a yellow moon-light. The sky was turning gray. At 5h 50'" I took the refractor to observe the second contact. I saw the formation of Baily's beads running from the top downward; the beads were more crowded at the top. Totality followed at 511 55·n 588 by Dent 2171, showing nearly Washington mean time. I think this observation at least three seconds slow, as the glow on the limb of the moon was deceptive. My pencil broke while recording this, and the remaining phenomena Of totality were noted immediately after from memory. I istopped to take oft' glasses; the corona appeared in the interval. I saw the protuberances as in diagrams; with my naked eye I also saw them. I saw no appearance of streaks on the preceding limb just before totality. The corona was brightest at the quadrants counting from the vertex. Streaks or rays reached the li1nb of the moon in the intervals of these quadrants. The protuberances were at first seen on the following limb, then they disappeared behind tbe moon's limb, aud others appeared on the preceding limb. The color of the corona was that of the electric spark in hydrogen. I say no Bai1y's beads at the end of totality. I observed the end of totality at 511 53w 428.5 by chronometer. I did not look away from the glass except at times already mentioned. I observed the final contact, also, with refraetor, at 6h 54m 088 .5 by chronometer. CHAI-tLES N. FAY. REMARKS-Just before totality I thought I saw a continuation of the upper limb of the moon.
It was probably owing to instrumental imperfection. I saw one or two flashes across the field

before totality. As they traversed the whole field I inferred that they were the effects of nervous fatigue. As to the protuberances, I am unable to give a more definite form to them, but I have thought since the eclipse that, taking down their positions from memory as I did, I interchanged the

"wings" with another protuberance; that is, the "wings" should be at the upper side of the horizontal diameter instead of below it, and rather nearer to it than the prot11berance originally plaeed there. The annexed diagram (Plate No. 25, Fig. 14) shows the position I propose. The dotted lines in my sketch connect the old positions of the protuberances A and B with the corrected pmiitions .A' and B'. Reports of Professor A. C. Twining, ,Jfr. George 'f· Carter, and Jlfr. Benjamin Ayeri.gg. Professor A. C. Twining reports some obserrntions which he made with the na.ked eye, at Springfield, Illinois. Ten minutes before the total obscuration began, he noticed, low down in the western horizo11, a pale twilight. .At 5h 1 m of true local time, Venus was first seen. After the totality commenced, an attempt was made, but unsuccessfrrlly, to disco.er traces of the zodiacal light. Vertically belpw the moon's center, a copper-colored protuberance appeared, which was judged to have an apparent length of about one-tenth of t11e moon's diameter, with a breadth only seven-tenths as large as the length. The projection of the moon's shadow on the upper atmosphere was perceptible, bringing to view long, thin streaks of cirrus clouds, which were invisible by ordinary daylight. Venus was steadily visible until 5h 19m7 and, with brief intermissions, until 5h 29m. l\Ir. Twining also furnishes the following obserrntion, made with the naked eye, by Rev. Charles H. Marshall, at )faftoon, Illinois: "The moment before total obscuration, beads of light appeared in great brillancy, apparently about six in number, differing in size, and equall.) <listributed over one-eighth of the sun's disk. These beads were mnch brighter than the prominences, flashing for an instant upon the sight, and then vanishing." l\Ir. George T. Carter has recorded the following obsen-ations made by l1im at Springfield, Illinois, when the sun was within about ten minutes of total obscuration: Standing at the top of au embankment, about 20 or 25 feet in height, witll his bad to the suu, he observed that his own shadow, cast at the foot of the embankme11t, had a sharp outline on its southern edge, while tye opposite edge was fringed and blurred, as if produce<l by two or more illuminating points. The blurred portion of the shadow was about four or five inches wide. The sha<lows of smaller ol~ects, receiYed at shorter distances, exhibited similar peculiarities. The plte110111euon uecame more and more distinct as the moment of total obscnration app'roached. The snme differc11ce was noticed between the upper and lower edges of the shadows, the upper edge showing the sharp outline. At your suggestion, :Mr. Carter has experimented 'IVith two lights of unequal brightness, and seen the combined sl1adows of a body exposed to tbem, surroimded by a penumbra of Yariabl( brightness, as might ham been anticipated. l\Ir. Carter concludes, therefore, tliat the small nneclipsed portion of the sun supplied the brighter light, and the protuberanees 011 the eclipsed edges, the fainter light. Under these two sources of ligbt, the penumbra of objects might be imperceptible on one side of their shadows and distinctly pronounced ou the opposite side.

J\Ir. Benjamin Ayc1igg obserycd the eclipse near New .Albany, Indiana, within the area of totality. He describes the corona as extending to a distance equal to one-eighth or one-tenth of the sun's diameter; its exterior being a wavy and ill-defined circle. Its color was bluish-white. Streaks of light extended in the direction of certain radii of the sun prolonged; that is, in the plane of the ecliptic and the reetangufar plane. These streaks had a length equal to three-quarters of the diameter of the sun. On account of the flashes seen in some of these streaks, Mr. Aycrigg thought that they did not belong to the sun, but were auroral streamers in the earth's atmosphere, made visible by the withdrawal of the sun-light during the eclipse. Mercury, Venus, and some of the bright stars, and also the red flame projecting beyond the moon, were distinctly seen.

The sky was entirely free from clouds during the whole afternoon, with the slightest possible haze or bluish smoke. Just previous to totality, the sky at the west, below the sun, was reddish yellow, growing more yellow toward the south. During totality to the north and northeast it was quite dark, almost black (seemed opaque, as no 11tru.·s were visible there); growing lighter toward the southeast. For some time befQre, and while totality lasted, the facefl of bystanders and other light·colored objects had a greenish-yellow color; the leaves looked yellow. After totality objects, generally,just seemed pale, without any color, as though they were lighted with. a faint wltite light, the light growing gradually ~tronger till the en<l of the eclipse.

persons remarked that the light was stronger just after the close of totality thau previous to the beginning of it. This effrct was clouhtless caused b;y the pupil of the eye having dilated in the darkness. · in tlie center of the crescent ; tho;;e near Baily's beads were seen onl,r at tlie cusps; and not the extremities being smallest, those more remote seeming elongated : tlwy ~1roppell off in succession Yery rapidly; there was no distortion of the cusps.

Some c1aim to ha>e seen more, bnt the aboYe are all that were recognized by the observers. No bodies were discovered betweeu the ::;uu and ::iiercury. Tile sweep of the ;;hallo"· was distinctly observed; it was first noticed on the river-bills, _§.ome two miles below tlw college, traveling rapidly toward Madison; when totality arri.-ed, the hiffs back of l\Iadison, about four miles aboYe, were yet in sun-light; in a few seconds they, too, were ':n darkness. 1.Yhcu the slJallow returned the Madison hills were again lightecl, while the observers were stiU in the gloom. In a few seconds it swept swiftly by, and down the rii-er for fourteen miles, when it was lost to Yie\z on the land, but was visible for se\"eral seconds after in the air, sweeping to the southeast. The flame protuberances were first obser.-cd just at the commencement of totality, aud at the place of the first inner con::act. Just at this moment the excitement was so intense that the obser>ers "·ere slightly thrown off their guard; the time, however, was Ycry carefully noted, though the shapes of the smaller flames "·ere~ not; but, to the rcco1lection of 011e obsern~r, they were jagged ancl almost a continuous chain to the southeastern limb. Some of the ilames were plainly visible to tlle naked eye, though, of course, their shapes iHre uol; tlH· color ihonght to be of a more reddish purple tllau rose color by sollle of the oliscncn;; l1y othcn;, more ol' a blL1ish-rose tinge.

The operations unuer the charge of As::;istant J.E. Hilgard comprised tile obserrntions of the

total eclipse at Des Moines, Iowa, anu determinations of the northern and southern limits of
totality; the former near Cedar Falls, Iowa, tlie latter near Saint Louis. The party at Des Moines consisted of Assistant Hilgard; Assistant Edward Goodfellow; l\Ir. J. H. Lane, of Washington City; Dr. T. C. Hilganl, of St. Louis; and l1ord SackYille A. Cecil, of England. The three former were practiced in obser>ations of time, but J'ifr. Goodfellow's sight had latterly been affected by over-use, and be was obliged to abstain from using his eyes for some time after the eclipse. Dr. Hilgard's skill in drawing from microscopic obserrntions was looked to for enabling him to furnish more precise delineations of the red protuberances than have usually been obtained. The weather was storm.r, with heaY.r rainR and higll winds during the night preceding the eclipse. In the morning it began to ciear away, :tnd about noon the sky became almost clouclTess; but a faint haze still appeared in the air during the entire afternoon. Mr. Hilgard observed with an achromatic telescope by Fitz, of 3~ inches aperture, focal length 29 inches, with an erecting eye-piece, gfring a mngnifying-power of about 40 diameters. The focal adjustment was very carefully made, and the definition exceedingly good. \Vith this telescope the first and last contacts were -view'cd and noted by .:\Ir. J. E. Hilg·ard. Tl.le first contact was unexpectedly well defined, which was subsequently ascribed to the fact that a considerable projection appeared on the moon's edge, which sensilily indented the sun's disk not far from the point of contact. The last contact was characterized by a peculiar appearance of a rapid diffnsion of light along the sun's margin, as of a restoration of liquid equilibrium ... . Both interior contacts were viewed by Dr. Hilgard, who had then taken his place at this telescope, which proved to giYe the best definition, for the purpose of figuring the red flames. The instants of beginning and end of totality were called out by him and noted by the former obserYer.

The corrections of the chronometers to local time were obtained by means of telegraphic timesignals sent from Springfield; the party at Des Moines having arrh'eu only on the day preceding the eclipse, and having had no opportunity to make observations of time, on account of clouds and rain. The difference of longitude between Des 1\foines and Springfield had 'been ascertained during the preceding spring to be 15m 55 8 .4~ when referred to the eclipse-stations.

If we deduce the first comparison, on August 7, from the last, by reference to that on August 6, we find a residual of only 0".1, assuring us of the good performance of the tiwe-keepers. The

, rate of the Kessels chronometer in 'Vashington, before the balance was checked for transportation,
was 4m 00·.9 oumenn time; that of the Fletcher, 3m 558 .15, neither differing much from the rate found at Des Moines. Mr. Lane observed with Negus 1281, going on mean time, and found by Professor Newcomb t-0 he fih 13m 0·.8 fast of mean time at the station. In the evening of August 7, transit-observations were obtained upon five stars, including ~ Ursm 1\Iinoris, with reversal of instrument, when the correction of chronometer Kessels 1287 is found-7·.45 on sidereal time, at 18h, with a probable error of± o·.12. Tliis value carrie<.l forward, with the known rate, to 19h 40m 16·.59, the showing of Kessels, when compared with the Springfield signals, gives 191, 4om 08· .87 for the sidereal time of comparison. The mean time by the Springfield signals is, as above stated, lQh 331n 12·.18, corresponding to 19h 40m 08·.60, showing a satisfactory agreement with the result obtained by observations at Des Moines.

In the above table, Mr. Goodfellow's observed time of beginning of totality has been increased by 5·, and that of last contact by 10'; tllese correction1; lwing considered as due to misreadings of the chronometer. Bketcltes taken during totality hy Dr. T. c. Hilgan1 (Figs. 1 ·and 2, Oil Plate ~o. 2G) revreSPnt the sketches made of the crimson flames, and iu Fig. ;3 is reproduced a ,-cry detailed sketch of the large protnherance, which, in minuteness of representation, excels all others that had hitllerto been obtained. Dr. Ililgard describes it in tllese words: '·The appearance of lowest protuberance was that of a cumulus, streaked out into u cirrns; on the right hand three long digitate, somewliat convergent stri::e, like a bird's wing, arnl rnu1er1aid by a fiak.r tnmor. This flaky substance, Yery much like a flying pile of do'ITn, 'ITas not distinguishable from terrestrial clouds, illuminated a pinkish rose color." In regard to the phenomena known as Baily'11 beads, Dr. Hilganl S<1,YS: "The rim of the moon was so rugged that the last crescent of tbt:' sun was Yi~i!Jl;r indented before being entirely cut -in t1ro in the lower 11narter by a 'monntain of the moon,' wllile all the rest wawrl in a Yery irregular, jagged manner, and ·rnrJ' much like a tllin rim of ice along the border of a wash-bowl when thawing. The appearance of the last fragments was entirely too fr1·egular to le;we any impression as of 'beads' at all, but more like irregular telegraphic <lots aml <lashes, and all entirely in accordance with the visible configuration of the moon's eclge; while that of the snn itself appeared rnathematicall.r exact like a liquid ocean of fire .. "It might be of interest to state that the rugged prc~ectiom; of the moon's rim, <luring the whole eclipse, appeared as if flickering, mostly from the UJ)per sides like sidewise deflections of light, so that the lo'ITer outline (south) appeare<l firm and distiuct; the upper consta11tly flickered over as in the ease of heated air over a field in summer. It may lun-e been that those borders were not then exact!.)' in the achromatic center of the fiehls, or it may ha Ye been, iu any ease, the flickering of the atmosphere, as I ha Ye seen it occnr in star-transits at noon; but I cannot exactly a~count for the difference of appearance on the upper and lower sides, except by imperfect aehromacy, a light-colored undulation washing over the upper bor<lrr, arnl a(fark-colored or weak one the lower, leaving the black craggy outlines distinct there.

DEAR SIR: As a member of your party at Des Moines, Iowa, I have the honor to submit th<'I following report of my observations tllere of the total solar eclipse, August 7: The station selected in the court-house square was about 215 feet north and 47 feet east of the })oiut southeast of the court-house, preYionsly determined in geographical position, aud marked by a copper bolt in a stone 14 by 18 inches square. liatitude of this point, 41 o 35' 2".G9; longitude west from Washington, lh Gm 17·.49; anti, consequently, position of the edipse-statiou, latitnde 41° 3.')' 04.81, and longitude 611 14rn 298 .04 west of Greenwich. My instrument was a Fraunhofer reconnoitering-telescope (direct Yision), focal length 30 inches, aperture 2f inches, maguifying-power about 40, sl1mdng the entire disk of the SLm in the field of view; shade-glass a dark orange color. Your instructions directed my attention s1iecially to the times of the four contacts, the forms and positions of the protuberances, and the general appearance of the corona. 'Yi th regard to the "protuberances, I was to observe more particularly those wl1ich might appear in the quadrant 90° to the left of the vertex. Sidereal chronometer Kesscls 1287 was used to note time. Its corrections and rates were obtained by exchange of telegraphic signals with Springfield, using the known difference of longitu<le 15m 55·.42 between the eclipse-stations.

The first contact with spot II near the edge of the sun's disk occurring; not far from totality, the time of last contact was not noted. In my telescope the coming on of totality was marked by a gradual diminution of the thin crescent of light on the northeastern edge of the sun, and then its sudden extinction ; no traces of beads or interruptions in the line of light being noticed. HaYing noted the time of total obscuration, and taken off the screen-glass, I sketched the outline and position (\f the three brilliant rose.colored protuberances on the sontheaHtern edge of the sun, as shown in Fig. 51 Plate No. 26. This was about six or scysn seconds after totality. These protuberances were so striking in appearance that tbey arrested my attention entirely, and I did not sec the small.er e1e'rntions which appeared (most probably at a later time) 011 the northeastern quadrant. After a hasty glance at the corona, catching sig;ht at the same time of l\Icreury and Venus, I looked again into the telescope, and saw, about a minute before the end of totality, the peculiarlyshaped, comet-like protuberances on the southwestern quadrant, but had no time to sketch accurately their shape or position, fearing lest I should lose the instant of the sun's re-appearance. This was noood, perhaps, a seconcl late, as r waited an instant after a point of 1igl1t sparkled on the moon's edge to make sure that it was not another of the rose-colored ftames. The diminution of light began to be quite marked about fifteen minutes-before totality, and, as the dark shadow fell, the lantern, previously lighted, flashed on the face of the chronometer a sudden illumination, without the <>icl of which it would have been almost impossible to note the time. A slight haziness in the atmosphere, which bad prevailed all the afternoon, detracted but little from the beauty of the eorona. With the naked eye, the protuberances appeared to me as diamond-like points of light on the edge of the moon's disk, but I could not liave made out their vivid rose-colored tint without the telescope. The general effect on the landscape I was not iu a l)OSition to observe, and lllY sketch of the corona was too hastily made to be worthy of preservation ; but, limited as was the extent of my view, the impression of beauty and sublimity prodnced by the total eclipse was one to endure for a life-time. Very respectfully, yours, ~PW 4np QOOPFELLOW, J, E·. HlLG4RD,.~sq.., &c.

RfJ_)ort of .T. H. Lane, Esq.
WA.SIIINGTON, D. U., August 28, 1869. DEAR Sm: By your direction, I proceeded on Tuesday, the 3d of August, to Des Moines, in Iowa, for the purpose of aiding in the ol1sernii'iou of the eclipse of the sua on Saturday, the 7th. I arriveti in Des Moines in the middle of the night of Thursday, and reported for duty the next day. Before we left Washington, it was expected that I would use a Coast Snney reconnoitering-telescope of 3 inches aperture ancl 46 to 47 inches focal length. I was directed to observe times of the first and fourth contacts of the moou's lim!J with that of the sun, and to look after the phenomena of totality. The times of second and tllir<l contacts of the limbs were left to my own discretion, not to lw noted unless it coulll be <lone consistently with the points to ,.,-hich I wished to direct my attention at totality, which also were left in great measure to my own discretion. After our arri>a-l in Des Moines, a change was made in the assignmcllt of the iDstrument with which I was to obser>e. Professor Nt.Jwcomb, of the lfoite<l States "Xarnl ObserrntorJ·, had taken out with him, and fitted temporarily with a wooden tube and wooden mountings, the object-glass of the refraction-circle of the obserntory. That of the transit-circle of"the observatory was also fitted up in the same man· ner; and as the former of these two large glasses had not been ·otherwise appropriated, it was, at the instance of Professor "Xewcomb, arranged between you and him that.it should be assigned to me. I gladly accepted the use of so powerful all instrument, though not without misgivings that it might have been more useful in the ha111l8 of a more experienced and expert obsen·er. This glass had a clear aperture of 5.() iDches, and, according to a measurement roughly ma<le since my return to Washington, a focal length of about 8 feet 7 inches. The eye-piece exclusirnly used with it was a positive or Ramsuen eye-piece, in the field of view of which 0.26 inch is found to subtend to the eye an angle of about 130 36', which corresponds to a >irtnal or compound focal length of 1.1 inches. The magnif.ying-1lo1Yer of the instrument was tht>refore not far from !l4. The full aperture was, then, large for the pO\Yer, and showed tlie details of the solar spots au<l facuhe beautifully well defined during the period of the eclipse. Some apprehension, however, ha>ing been expresseu of undue heating of the e.Ye-glasscs by the sun's rnys, the aprrture was contracted, during the early part of tlte progress of the eclipse, by means of a screen, in the center of which was cut a circular ope11ing, of a diameter whid1 I jmlge to ha Ye hPen a little over two inches. The inferiority of definition hy this contracted aperture, as compared with that of the full aperture, was very marked indeed, and yet it gaYe a completely satisfactory obserrntion of the first contact. Before the eclipse was on1 r, it became eYidcnt that the full aperture- might have been used from the first, without injnrJ- to the e;ye-gfasses, and the last contact was obsen·ed '"ith the full aperture of 5.9 inches. It is the e,ye-lens abow, that is exposed to the greatest iuternsity of rmliation, together, of course, with the colored screen-glass usually placed immediately in frollt of it. In place, how· ever, of the screen-glass so used, I introcluced a deeply-colored glass into the field of Yiew itself, that is, into the focus of the object-glsss. The primary object I had in view in this will be stated in the report I am directed to make to the head of the United States ::S-aval ObservatorJ·· But besides the particular purpose which led me to use the colored glass in the field of view, such a disposition of it, supposing it to be of' a material that largel.Y absorbs the heat-rays as well as the luminous, carries with it an important adrnntage in regard to the heating. In the instrmneut employed in this case, the image of the sun was almost an inch in diameter, anq the heat-rays conwquently were even less concentrated than at the focus of a much smaller glass of the usual proportiou of focal length. The adyantage of so extended a surface for the absorption and dissipation of the beat-rays is obYious. The colored glass I used was a deep-blue glass, one.eighth of an inch thick, as near as I could guess, loaned me by Dr. Ililgard, of Saint Louis, who was of our party. It showetl the sun's disk soft an(l easy to the eye, and the heating at the eye-lens was so slight that it was not noticed even with the full aperture. What is to hinder the fitting of screen-glasses in this manner as a general rule¥ It might be expedient to S(\parate the glass far enough from the focus to prevent slight scratches from showing, and it would always be necessary to remember that the introduction of the plate int() the conical part of the pencil, whether at the focus or elsewhere, displaces the focus through an interval equal t-0 one-third the thickness of tlte plate (for a glass of index: 1!), but would there be any material inconYenience in this f

REPORT OF THE SUPEIUNTENDENT OF

Originally I intended to observe the contacts with the colored screen-glass that accompanies the eye-piece; but, as the time of first contact approached, it was found impossible to bring it to bear, because the cap in which the eye-hole is made could not be unscrewed from its place. Accordingly, the first contact was from necessity obse1:sed through the blue glass, slid into the field of view for that purpose ; but it proved so satisfactory, notwith~taqding some scratches which it showed in the field, that it was used for the fourth contact from choice. I have already stated that the first coatact was taken with a reduced aperture, judged to be a little over two inches in diameter, and that this showed the contact very satisfactorily. The eye seernetl to detect the first touch of the moon's limb to that of the sun, and it was some four seconds before I ceased watching for complete assurnnce of the indentation. It is not easy to say what gi-ves the e;ye its first impressiou of the change. It has been suggested tllat it may depend more on a certain change in the character of the boundar,r than on any percefred indentation, and this snggc.stion offered itself irnlependently to myself. If it be a change in the character of the boundary, the change seems too subtle to be easily traced. I am not sure that on this occasion, and on the occasion of the eclipse of May 2G, 1854, when, with an excellent recom10itering-teleseope of ,the Coast Surwy, I obserYed the phenomena, though not the times, of both contacts >1"ith all the care and scrutiny I could command, tbe instant of first contact has not been better appreciated than that of last contact, as if the supposed peculiar condition due to the touch of the moon's limb produC'es upon the rye a more marked effect by its adn~nt than by its departure. I here give the times of first and last contacts as noted by me by chronometer Negus No. 1281, without applying the correction for the error of the chronometer:

You were asking me if I saw lfail,y's beads. ln answer, I will anticipate the sul~ject of my report to t11e obserYatory Ro far as to Rn,y font the nm·oycred part of the sun's disk was .-iewed through the blue glass in the field of 'iew, ;J1Hl that ns soon nR the light of the sky nPar th(· m·e>;ccnt became tolerable to the eye, the blue glas8 was slid partl,v out of the field, so as to lea Ye free passage for the light from the field. of Yiew to the eye, except that part of the field in which the crescent was viewed through tbe blue glaRR. It must lie recollected that my attention was gh·en primarily to that part of the. moon's limb near to the cresc:ent, but beyonu the cusp and beyoucl t1Jc edge of the blue glass. Yet the northern cusp and the mid.dle of the crescent were in yiew, and an impression was left on my mind that the last portions of the crescent fell off in fragments. A similar observation has been before reported by some one t·lse in a former eclipse. So far as 1 can rely on my own impression in this case, it cannot be better described than by saying that it was not calculated to excite sur11rise after the prominent manner in which the irregularities of the moon's outline had been seen projected on the soft blue of the sun's t11sk. 1 must not omit to state here that after the beginning of thG eclipse, and before the approach of totality, the colored glass (a retl glass, I believe) was brought to bear in the common way before the eye-lens, and. that the telescope was focused upon the solar spots b'its use, with the blue glass slid from the field of view, so that afterward the open part of the field of .-icw, in which the corona was to be watched at the near approaeh of totality, might be in good focus in preference to the part to be then occupied by the blue glass; but that upon remoyiug the red g1ass1 and sliding the blue glass back into the :field of yiew, it was found that the eye readily accommodatt!d itself to the change of focus so produced. I will take this occasion to add a little account of tbc observations, already alluded to, which I made upon the solar eclipse of May 26, 18iH. The observations were entirely negative as to result, yet, as was remarked to me by a scientific friend at the time, such observations may be worth reporting wben they l1ave any bearing upon actually mooted points. The Coast Snrvey telescope loaned me on that occasion had, as lfear as I can remember, a clear aperture of, say, 2! inches or upward. My object was to watch for some of the mysterious phenom~na which have appeared to present themselves to other observers at the contacts of the moon's limb and durina-

the progress of the ec1ipRe. I prepared for the occasion by fitting up a ual'k room at a wcRt windo\'I' of the east wing of the Patent-Office, mounting the telescope in the window. The sun's image was thrown upon a screen at a short dista11c11 from the eye-ernl of tLe tlescope, giving the image a diameter somewl1at iu the ueighborboo<l of two inches, as 11ear as I cau remember, or such aR seemed most satisfactory to the eye by sliowiug the definition with suitable intensity of illmnination. The first contact was oliser\·ed in this manner. What I particularly looked for was a peculiar phenomenon which had been reported by some obserwrs at tlie time of contact of the limus. I be1ieYC it was the formation of a notch in the sun's disk at the point of contact. At any rate, nothing rnaryelous appeared. The eye was, perhaps, impressed by a tliflerence in the cbaracte+ of the boundary formed by the moon's limb, but the form of the boundary, from the very first instant of coutact~nward, was nothing· else than the form of that part of the rnoo11'1:; limb as seen when fully advanced upon tbe sun's disk, so fa.r a1:; I could see. The Rk_y was ueautifully clear <luring the entire pel'iod of the eclipse, and the contact was '"ell sPen. A short time after the beginning of the eclipse I preferred to tliscoutiuue the use of the screen aud ,-iew the suu directly with a colored glass. I made it my chief. business during the continuance of the eclipse to look for tlle fringe of light which has sometimes ueen reported as seen along the moon's limb projected on the suu's disk. I saw nothing of the kind except what was distinctly traced at the time to the eye itself. I experimented on this point all through the time of the eclipse. \Yhenever the eye was held for some little length of time "·itllout a wink, and in complete fixity upon the object, all distinctively uorder-light inyariably disappeared, leayiug nothiug but purely the projection of the moon's form npon the sun. ·nut not the slightest moYement or change iu the eye could take place, with this point on the attention, without calling into instant being a colored border, often yery YiYid. Tbe cause of this is too obyious and well known to be pointed ont here, arnl it is on]_,. the negati>e part of the ollsen·ation that there is an;y occasiou to mention. The wav.r motion along the moon's border, which ltad also been mentioned by some observers in connection with eclipses, was another o~ject of attention on that occasion. Such w~w.r motion as I saw did not appear distinguishable from that which is generally seen in telescopic observations. Final1y, at last contact nothing was seen more than at first contact. The last contact was obser'\"ed with a screen-glass. I do not undertake to giYe the color of the glass used in any of these observations, as I cannot do it with certaint.>. The presumption is that it was a red glass. Respectfully submitted. J. HO:M:ER LANE. Professor HILG.um, &c. Report of Mr. S . .c1. Ceeil.

obsen·er). Almocst the whole remaining time was occupied in observing the large prominence roughly sketched. It was of a decided pinky red color, standing out with, as it were, a background of brilliant "l"l'hite light, presumed by observer to be the ''corona." The appearance was as of space between the prominence and its background, the former being exceedingly sharply defined. Through the telescope the prominence appeared brighter in proportion to its color than its backip:ound. The other prominences on the left-hand quarter were only glanced at through the telescope. The portion of the sun's disk in view was too small to obtain more than the one prominence in view at a time. A hasty glance seemetl to show that this was the only one that came in observer's quarter of' disk (afterward proved incorrect), and he therefore confined himself solely to observ-ation of this one. His observations with the 1mked eye were very imperfect. Through the telescope the prominence appeared like ineamlescent gas of a semi-transpar~nt ruby look about it, and reminded one of steady flame rising up from a large fire clear of smoke and blown violently over in one direction by a gust of wind, which seemed to have more effect on the top of the prominence than on its base. No detached portions were observed, as stated by some to have been seen in another part of the snu's disk. Comparatively sl1i1w ch:l!lges of form appeared to be going on in the prominence. ,

Obsen·ations to c7ctermhw tltc northern limit of totaWy.
Dr. Asa Horr, of Dubuque, Iowa, kindly undertook to make arrangements for observations to determine the northern limit of totality; in the yicinity of the town of Cedar Falls. It was supposed that the limit would pass some distrtnce to the south of the town, and the disposition of obsen·ers was made accordingly; but the eyent proved that the limit was several mile11 to the westward of the places of obserrntiou. Through Dr. IIonJs endeavors a number of stations were laid out by a competent surveyor, under tlrn direction of 1\lr. ~W. I. Anderson, ci\-il engineer, of Dul:mque, at intenTals of half a mile, one of them being the cupola of the Soldiers' Orplrnns' Home. These stations arf\ shown on the plan (Fig. 7, Plate No. 2G), as well as the place of observation in the town of Cedar Falls, an<l the astronomical station, from which the geographical positions are derived. Trustworthy observations of the duration of totality were obtained as follovt8: At station No. 5, by l\Ir. W. I. Anderson, 71 seconds. At 11tation No. 2, hy l\lr. E.W. Horr, 63~ seconds. At station No. o, by Mr. J. II. Stanley, 51 seconds. In addition to the11e values, 1\fr. E.W. Horr observed tlte following:

We were pro· vided with fl ve first-class double and single quarter-second watches, which were generously furnished for the purpose by Giles, Morse & Co., of this place. We were kindly assisted hy George 0. Dean, of Dubuque, and by J. H. Stanley an<l J. J. Tolerton, of Cedar Falls, who took stations as obseners. Tlte line of observation .and tlte positions of the obse1Ters were located by E. Rodenberger, civil engineer, who also furnished an accurate plat of the same, which is herewith presented. At 12 o'clock noon, we corrected tlle watches by the signals transmitted by telegraph of the precise mean time of Dubuque. Tlte first station was half a mile northeast of the Soldiers' Orphans' Home, which js two miles south of the city; the second at the cupola of the Orphans' Home; the third, fourth, and fifth on the same ~inc, half a mile apart, extending southwest. "In due time the stations were occupied, the first by George C. Dean, second by E. W. Horr, third by W.W. Wormood, fourth by J. J. Tolerton, and the fifth by William I . .Anderson. In addition, an observation was made by J. H. Stanley opposite his storr, on }fain street, each of whom were provided with colored glasses, lanterns, and assistants. ''The sky, which hall been clear dming the day, became slightly hazy a short time before the beginning of the eclipse, hnt whidt <lid not, in any respect, interfere with the perfection ot' the observations. The wind blew a gentle breeze from the east. ".At the store of Wise & Bryant the average temperature in the shade, before the eclipse, was 740, which, at the period of totality, fell to 670. ''At the Orphans' Home, the first contact was at 3 o'clock 53 minutes and 42 seconds; dura· tion, 2 hours 32i seconds.

During the time, dew deposited plentifully on the grass. "At the southwest, the darkness was of the blackest character, while at the northeast, through a lurid haze, trees conhl be seen basking in the dim sun-light in the vicinity of Janesville, eight or ten miles. distant. .

Obseri:ations neor Saint Lou ix to determine the southern limit of totality.·
Arrangements for obserying the southern limit of totality were kindly undertaken by l\lajor J. · Pitzman, count,y-suryeyor for Saint Louis:, who, aided b5· l\fessrs. Eimbeck, l\fcl\fath, Soldan, Cobb, )foKown, Burgas, and Schmidt, occupied five positions arra11gct1 across the path of the shadow at distanc!'s of nearly one mile apart, and ouserycd the dur11:tion of the eclipse. The stations are shown on diagram No.10, Plate 26. The following reports of l\Iajor l'itzman and Professor Eimbeck give all the essential facts, to which it is only necessar,y to adtl that none of the obsen-ers had eyer witnessed a total eclipse of the sun, and that 1\Iessrs.

REPOHT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT O.F

Report by Professor lFilliam Eimbeck to Julills Pitzman, Esq.
Sm: I submit to you the retmlts of my ohserrntions of the solar eclipse, Augnst 7, 1869, at a poiut near the southern limit of the shadow anu within it. Station occupied some 10 feet west of seven-mile post, between Coal Switch and l\Iitchel Stations, Saint Louis antl Alton J{ailroad, and about three miles southwardly of tllc former. At 4 o'clock p. m. fixed my refractor (of 34 inches focal length and 2.4 inches clear aperture) upon the point iu the sun's uorthwesteru etlge I had previously caleulated as the point of first contact (see diagram No. 11, Plate 26). At 4h 2m 28·, as indicated by the Ilotlell chronometer, tllis first contact occurred at the very point where I had been watching it, and thns rccunled it, perhaJlS, within a second or two correct. The diagram represents tile solal" disk with its clusters of spots as showu by my instrnment. Their relative positions ba,·e been sketched with care. The position of the meriaian and the other lines in respect to the "vertical" correspond to the instant, 411 4m, or the assumed time of the beginning of the eclipse. (Ilour-angle assnme}l 590 30'.) The moon's edge in its pas&age oyer the sun's disk touched the little distinct spot designated No: 1, a, at 4 11 28111 10·; No. 2, c, at 41i 47m 11· (band c coultl not be observed; a patch of drifting feather-cloud obscured distinct vision). Of tile cluster of spots designated, No. 3, c, was touched by the moon's edge at the instant 4i, 44m 52". The nstaut of total obscurity occurred at 5 11 4m 57·. Ba.ily's beads beauUfnll,y dislinct and apparently spreading over an arc of more than thirty degrees. Noticed them all round as the" horns" of the new moon-" in the arms of the ohl"-shorte1w<l. Immediately after the last sunbeam had vanishe<l, I removed the "I.ontlon smoke," for which I hall prcdon~ly preprned, an11 which I hall attaclled to the eye-llole of the refractor with a little wax; but finuing it difficult to get the lumi· uaries into the field of tbe instrument again, and not knowing of wbat duration the total obscurity might be, I obsen·ed the re-appearance of light without its aid. This ensued at the instant [jh 5m 29·. Both these instants, howe\er, may have been recorded a 1'ecoml or two later than what, perhaps, shoulcl be eonsideretl the true instants of beginning antl entl of totality, because, in the first instant, the light of the "heads," several in number, faded away so gradually as though it ne.-er woultl totally disappear, and the instant recorued corresponds to the 11isappcarance of the wry last bead. The second instant or re-appearance of light, because it was obsene<l through the "Lontlon smoke" with the naked eye. The duration of totality, therefore, cannot be materially erroneous, provided, of course, the time was noted correctly, which in both tlH'se instances I could not .-erify. The last contact of the edges of the two luminaries admitted of Yery exact obserrntiou and occurretl at (ih 1m 47". The time was recorded by ,V. H. Rodgers, an exi;ericnced clock-maker, and has been checked by myself, except in the two instants marking the totality as aho.-c mentioned. The extreme anxiety to observe with the utmost accuracy the proper moments of beginning and end of totality, as well as the exciting display of this most wonderful aud sublime phenomenon that ever my eyes witnessed, made me forget this duty. The (Ho<}ell) chronometer was adjusted to Saint Louis mean time. A comparison with the (Dent) chl'onometer belonging to Professor Chauvenet, at 10 o'clock a. m., August 7, 1869, and several days previous, was made in ortlcr to determine and check the effect of trarisportation by railroad, &c., upon its rate. Professor Chanvenet's chronometer, by certificate of himself, indicated correct Saint Louis local time June 23, 18G9, and has a plus 'rate of 1.8 seconds per day.

Tue obserYations obtained indicating that tile limit of totality could be inferred from them with considerable prccisiou, it became desirable to ascertain tlie geographical positions of the stations with some degree of exactness. It was judged adYisable to make the requisite obserya. tions of latitude aml longitude at some point within the city, and refer the eclipse-statious t-0 the same by triangnlatiou, hotll ou account of the convenience ·or obseryers and because the geographical position of Saint Louis had neYcr before been asccrtaineil with precision. Arrangements were therefore made with the officers of "Tashington University, in pursuance of which piers for the instruments of the Coast Surn·y were erected by them on tlic grounds of the uniyersity, and a temporary building "·as put np O\'Cr tliem at the expense of the Coast Survey. The obserrntions for latitude were maue in December, 18G9, by Mr. 0. Il. Tittman, of Saint Louis, aid in the Coast SnrYe,r, witli a 23·inch zenith-telescope, by twenty.six observations UJ,)On nine pairs of stars. The resulting latitude is 38° 38' 03".2, with a probable error of:±: 0".2. Additional obserrntions were subsequeFtly made by I'rofessor Eimbeck with the same instruments, ;yielding 38'J 38' 03".30 ± 0".1G from forty.thrt>e oh8errntions upon twenty-eight i)airs of stars. The ohsenations for Jo11gitmle were deferred until the follmdng ·~<\.pril, on account Qf the uufrworable season. Tlie,r "·ere made by Professor William Eimbeck, of Saint Louis, in conjunction with the United States OhRrtTatory i:t \Yashington. At :::faint Louis the instruments used were a 26-inch transit aml sidereal dtrouomcter, the correction of which was determined o.r the obserya. tion of not less thau SC\'euteen stars on each night. After star-obsern1tions, the chronometer was compared by coiucideuces of beat \Yith another chronometer going to mean time, which was then carried to the telegraph-office, whence signals coincident with its beats were sent to Washington and recorded upon the chronograph at tile United States Observatory, on wllicb the heats of the sidereal clock were at tlie same time r<·gistcretl. Next the \Yashington clock was put into tl!e circuit, antl its heats, repeated at Saint Louis, noted by eoincideuces with those of the mean-time chronometer, which was finally carried hack to the Observ:ttory, and again eomparetl with tbe sidereal chronometer, in order to make certain that 110 derangement had taken place during transportation. The observations at 'Vashiugton ",ere made by Profossor \Villiam Harkness, United States Na>y, with the twelve-foot telescope .of the transit-circle. · The following are the results of four <1itrerent nights on which obserrntions were obtained at both places, and signals successfully exchanged:

telegraph-wire and through the repeating and recording instruments, and too large by the same amount from the signals sent westward. ..The effect disappears in the mean of the two compal'isons, and half their difference measures the time of transmission, which in the present case was OS.16, or about one-seYenth of a second of time. In order to ascertain the personal equation between the two ohsernrs, Professor Eimbeck subsequently proceeded to \Vasbington and ohsernd the time, at a point in the meridian of the transit-circle, with the transit and chronometer nsetl at Saint Louis, and compared bis time so obtained with that observed by Professor Harkness with the transit-circle and chronograph, in the same manner in which the comparisons had pre\'iously been made when observing at Saint Louis. It was thus ascertained that Eimbeck was ou the aYerage later than Harkness by o·.08, by which amount the longitude above given must be diminished. At the same time, the transitcircle being 0·.07 west of the center of the obsen·atory to which the longitudes are referred, we must add that quantity anll obtain finally, for the longitude of the station in Saint Louil'I, west of Washington, 52 00 36·.92, which value is not unc.ertain more than two-hundredths of a second. The Washington Observatory dome being 5h gm 12·.06 west of Greenwich, we obtain for the station in Saint Louis 6h oom 48·.98. In order to reduce the observed yalues t-0 the center of the court-house, we must deduct from the latitude 25".7 of arc, and from the longitude 3·.63 of time, so that we have finally, for the court-house of Saint Louis, latitude, 330 3i' 37 11 .5; longitude, 6h om 45·.35; or, in arc, 900 11' 2011.25. The public are indebted t-0 1 tbe Vfestern Union Telegraph Company for the free use of their lines, kindly granted through General Anson Stager, superintendent of the western di\·ision, for the purpose of the foregoing determinations. Special acknowledgment is due to .Mr. M. D. Crane, of the Western Union Telegraph Office in Saint Louis, for bis assistance in the transmission of signals and messages, which was rendered gratuitously, as was all the arduous aud long-continued work of Professor Eim beck. · J.

Obsen'ations of tlte eclipse at Cherokee, Iowa.
OMAHA, A 11gust 24, 1869. VEAR Sm: I observed the lat~ total eclipse at Cherokee, Cherokee County, Iowa, about sixty miles inland from Sioux City, quite successfully, as far as my means and instruments permitted. I had a clock; Morse register for chronograph; portable transit, 32-inch; and an ordinary telescope, pillar and claw mounting, of 4 feet focal length and 3.3 inches aperture. I had also a railway-transit, with additional lens over object-glass, by which I could directly read the position of the end of the needle for variation, somewhat after the manner of variation-transit; also barometer and thermometer. The observed contacts in local sidereal time are as follows, subject to some correction on final determination of error and rate of clock from observations for time;

OBSERV A'fIONS AT KOHKLUX, CHILKAHT RIVEH, ALASKA.
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, Septembe1· 9, 1869. DEAR Srn: The path of totalit~· of the solar eclipse of August 7, through Alaska, passed nearly parallel to the coast-line from the head of Cook's Inlet to the Stakeen mver, but, from the information I gathered in 18G7, I found it would be impracticable to carry instruments and provisions up the Sutchitna or Kneek Rh:ers from Cook's Inlet; across the mountains that border Prince William's Sound; up the Atna or Copper River; across the mountains at the head of Behring's Ba.y; or up the A.lsegh River. Natives do cross the Saint Elias range by the latter ri,·er to the ,-alley of the Chilkaht River, but only in winter with snow-shoes. The Yukatat or Saint Elias range, with its hundreds of glaciers, and anrage elerntion of 8,000 or V,000 feet, effectually bars transportation; moreover, the country on the east flank is uninhabited, and throughout affords no means of sustenance. In 1867 I examined the mouth of the Chilkaht River, emptying into tlie head of Chatham Strait, between two high mountain-ranges, in latitude 590 12', only forty or fifty miles in a direct line south-southwest from the central path of totality. This, too, was the nearest point to that line reached by navigable waters. It also offered the opportunity of my observing the transits of the limbs of the sun and the moon during the eclipse owr the meridiau, as I had done at Humboldt Bay in 1864. In undertaking the conduct of this expedition in 1868, I determined to ascend the Takou River or the Chilkaht. Sir James Douglas, in answer to my inquiries, wrote me that the Cbilkaht and Takou were unexplored; that the latter, for forty or fifty miles, })USSell through a very mountainous region filled with glaciers. This decided me to ascend the Chilkaht, the lower reach of whose valley I had seen for ten or fifteen miles, and having learned from the Indians that thi'ly traded as far northward as Fort Selkirk, on the Youkon River. Oar first understanding was, that not only should observations of precision be made, but obserrntions with the spectroscope; and that photographic pictures also should he taken. Your lette1· of November 18, 1868, howeYer, limited my action so as to'' secure the great.est precision in observing the p~ases, time, &c., with reference to data for the longitude," while spectroscopic obserrntions and photographic impressions were to be undertaken only i.n case volunteers should offer for such duty. On May 18, you informed me that" no spectroscope "·as available for m.r nse." No volunteers offered for such a long and hazardous undertaking; no steamers were running t-0 Sitka; and from Sitka 1 had to trust to canoes for a rough trip" of two hnn<lred frn<l fifty miles to m.r destination. Lest the whole expense and time of the expedition ~hould be lost by a cloudy day on the 7th of August, I determined to obtain the latitude and longitude of as ma-ny positions en route as practicable, and to make as many flying sketches <1f harbors as the time and weather would allow. That work I have already .reported to you. The following are the instruments taken for the whole work : 1. For latitude, time, and azimuth, the new meridian instrument, United States Coast Survey No. 1, of which I have specially reported. 2. For observations of the eclipse, a telescope by Fraunhofor, object-glass, 3 inches diameter; focal length, 45 inches; astronomical eye-piece with power marked 55. In this eye-piece I bad a
H.Ex.20~23

diaphragm inserted with two threads at right angles, while the inner edge of the diaphragm was cut as a micrometer-rack, with nine teethJ;o each quadrant. The eye-piece which I had suggested for determination of the position, extent, and elevation of the sun-flames was not made. The instrument was equatorially mounted for a latitude of 45'.l, and had movement by rack-work in two planes. For some daJ-s before the eclipse, the apparent size of the sun in the field of view was well studied, in order to familiarize myself with the approximate determination of angles, and the relative size of objects on the lirnh. During the eclipse-observation, it was set up in the open air near the transit-tent, and was protected from a light east-southeast air by the fly of a tent. 3. In order to record the times of beginning and ending of the eclipse, beginning and ending of totality, transits of the sun's and the moon's limbs over the meridian, occultation of spots, and other phenomena, the Hipp chronograph, with new helices, was mounted and connected with the Frodsham break-circuit chronometer No. 3'179. Both were working -very nicely. 4. From San Francisco I had taken seventeen chronometers, of which six belonged to the United States Navy, and had been kindly loaned to me by Lieutenant Commanding E. C. ~1erriman, of the l\fare Island navy-yard. The break-circuit chronometer was only used for this special work. Fearing the dangercus navigation of the Chilkaht River in canoes, I left nine of the chronometers at Sitka, and carried eight to my station on the river. 5. Thermometers and barometers were placed iu two positions during the eclipse, but a close systematic series of observations could not be obtained with the limited assistance I had. For the same reason the magnetic instruments were not observed. Ci. I bad, in addition to tlle abo;-e instruments, octant, theodolite, gradienter, &c., for local surveys. By the kindness of Major-General Thomas, commanding the Division of the Pacific, I was enabled to reach Sitll:a on the United States quartermaster's steamer Newbern. Thence there was no vessel available, antl I was compelled to undertake the worst part of the journey in an op.en boat kindly furnished to me by Major-General Davis, commanding the Department of Alaska. A large war_-canoe, with a chief and six men of the Sitka tri!Je, carried part of my provisions and instruments. :My experience upon this coast with Indian tribes was such that I declined "any escort of sol· diers. :.\Iy party consisted of Mr. S. R. Throckmorton, jr., a,: aid, and four men, and no interpreter. The tribe of Cbilkahts numbered 11500, and was considered the most hostile on the coast, especially as General Davis· had recently kept their chief ten days in the guard-house, aml shot one or two of their men in trying to pass the guard. The officers looked upon my undertaking as reckless. I did not. The day I left Sitka was tlle commencement of bad weather, and I was attacked with Panama fever, so that we were eleven days in reaching our station" Kohklux," at the Chilkabt village of Kot-kagh-too, ou the left bank of the Chilkaht River, in latitude 59° 23' 42", and longitude 1350 58' 12". Here the valley of the river is about two miles wide, and the mountains on each side reach an elevation of about 2,500 feet, with very steep sides. I intended to ascend higher and to get directly in the central line of totality, but the river came from the west-northwest and I should have been obliged to travel over one hundred miles, by the windings of the river, to make twenty, .and, moreover, that would have landed me in British Columbia. I could not get my instruments and provisions over or upon the mountain1t, becaui;1e the Indians are unaccustomed to pack, and no trail led oyer them. From July 27th I had fine weather for all preliminary ob1tervations of latitude, longitude by chronometer, magnetic declination, dip, intensity, &c. For three or four days preceding the 7th, we bad heavy, cloudy weather. On the morning of the 7th, the weather was cloudy, the barometer rising rapidly, and at 9 a. m. it appeared likely to break away; but soon after that the sky became quite covered with heavy masses of cumuli. The beginning of the eclipse was lost because of a cloud obscuring the sun for about half a minute. The limb of the moon was very iharply defined, and the outline of the sun was ve'ry steady and sharp. . At the times of occultations of spots, clouds intervened. .At the meridian passaa-e of the sun

and moon a few drops of rain fell, au1l the transits of the limbs """ere lost. The atmm·.phrre continued remarkably steady. As the eclipse progressed the growing darkness was Yer:r marked, but altog-cthcr different from that of twilight or moonlight. About the time the sun was half ob;:;cured the chief Koh-klux and all the Indians bad disappeared from arou11cl the observing-tent; they left off fishing 011 the river-banks; all employments were discontinued; and e·ery soul disappeared; nor was a sound heard throughout the 'Village of fifty-three houses. Ernn the e,·crlastingly ho'\\ ling curs seemed to be quieted down. The natives had been warned of what would take place, but doubted the prediction. When it did occur they looketl upon me as the cause of the sun'" being "ver~· sick and going to bed." They were thoroughly alarmed, aml overwhelmed ll'ith an undefinable <lrea<l. Two or three minutes before the commencement of totality the clouds broke a'\\ay directly around the sun, ancl the crescent was Yery beautiful to the unassisted eye and in thr telescope. In the telescope the borders of the sun and moon were remarkably steady and wry sharply defined. In twenty-four ~-ears of practice in obser'l'ing I ha,-e rarely, if ever, seen them under such f1n·orable circumstances. I observed them without auy shade, and fo1lowe11 the :mu'i; honler to tl1e i11stant, of its disappearauce. The bright, long, narrow crescent was slrnrpl.v and regularly defined throughout; the extremities were clear-cnt aud pointed. .As the width autl le11g,th of the crescent decreased, this same sharpness of outline and regularity of form '"ere maintained nutil it became a fine line of living white; and, shortening rapidly, it disappeared as a wry 1>hort, Jiue~ distinct line, and not as a star at its disappeara11ce. There waR no breaking of this line into point-s or beacls; no wave-motion along it; no disturbance wlmtever of continuity or regularity of form. I watched to see whether the last Yisihle edge of the Rnn would apprar pr~jt'ctc(l upon the black border of the moon, as I have twice obsen·ed a Scorpii projt'ete1l for :2.:J becomlli upon the bright limb of the moon at the occultation of that star, hut no such phenomenon presented itself. In noting the time of commencement of totality, the chronometer was held within ten or t'\\elye inches of me, and I distinctly read the seconds and the minutes, while my ai<l made the rccor<l in lead-pencil, but says it wa.s difficult to read the writing after making tlie record. \V c had no artificial light at the station. Instantly upon the disappearance of the last edge of the snn, the narro", bri,qht white line uf the corona took)ts place, and was as sharply defined and unbroken as the sun's edge bad been. The appearance of the long, narrow line of the stm's border, just before its ohscnration, may be described as a cuned line of silwr at a white l1eat, glowing and liYing, yet not dazzling; while the curved line of the corona, may, in comparison, be described as a fine line of bright burnished silver, fron(which the rays of the corona started; it lacked the vividness of tbe sun-crescent, yet I think an inexperienced observer might have mistaken it for the border of the sun still lrnnging on with diminished brightness. The)ose-colored)lames from the sun's limb were seen before I took my eye from the telescope. After the record of the time of totality, say in less than eiglit* seconds thereafter, I commenced to note~_the~position,~extent, and elC'Vation of these flames; searching the whole circumference of the moon for faint or minute prominences, and noting'the appearance and extent of the corona. Tlie flames were no( of uniform color, but were marked hy <lark lines perpendicular to tlie moon's Jim b; on the larger flame these dark lines were very distinct. The coloring of these flames was vi Yid, not tame or dead, and markedly and peculiarly relieYed by the black body from wl1ich they appar ent1y arose. Their outline was yery distinct. To the unassisted e:ye they were l)rilliant, unmarked by lines, and showed as only two masses of flame; ·the two smaller oneR showing as a single, long flame of inferior height. The spectacle was sublime; the solcmu feeling with which the growing darkness, the bold, dark mountains, the rush of the swift-Bowing river, and the wild surroundings had affected e\'ery one gave way to bursts of admiration at this magnificent glory in the heaYens. The corona was not visibie around the moon's whole circumference at the earlier period of totality ; but after I had established the position, &c., of the flames, it was observed aroullll less than half the circumference, with a faintish glow around the other half, but sufficient to bring out
· I estimate it less than eight seconds, because I observe and record transits of nine seconds apart; and I lost no time here, while the rooor<l was made by my aid.

in bold contrast the dark outline of the moon. This may have arisen in part from the cloud which intervened after I had lwen watching the phenomena about one and a half or two minutes. The extreme height of tlte rays of the corona was about one-third the diameter of the moon; uo waviness was seen in the ra,Ys. .Mr. Throckmorton reports that to the naked eye the mys appeared to extend beyond the outline of the moon about one-tenth of the moon's diameter, and to be equally bright around the whole disk.* The annexed sketch (Plate :Ko. 20, Fig. 15) shows the general appearance of the flames, their position, extent, elevation, and color, as closely as I could determine them, and the limit of the corona when my attention was particularly directed to that. "'When I found that clouds had hidden the moon from me, I looked up the valley of the Chilkaht, which makes a small angle with the path of totality, and saw, on the northeast flank of the mountain-range on the right bank,.the line of the coming light sweeping down rapidly, showing through rifts in the clouds, and beautifully lighting up the snow-filled gulches and crests of the mountains. To the senses, the increasing light after totality was much more rapid than the decreasing light before totality had been, although the clouds were, to all appearances, the same. The natives felt its influence at once, and came from their houses in hundreds; gradually they approached and surrounded the observatory. A feature of the phenomena of totality was the vivid impression that the <lark body of the moon stood out clearly and unmistakably in relief in the space between the olisen·er and the brightness around the olJscured body of the sun, and did not lie flat and upon it, as in a picture. The limited number of my party pre\·ented the observation of magnetic changes. A few meteorological observations were made; little or no change of temperature was appreciable to the senses; and, I think, the sun, occasionally breaking through the clouds, maskeu any real change.

Goyernor \Villiam 11. Seward and party were on the river, coming up to my station, at the time of the eclipse. As the obscuration advanced the Indians refused to proceed, landed, and fled to the bush, and returned soon after totality. The gentlemen had a fine view of the sun-flames and corona through a break in the clouds, and from their position had an excellent view of the approaching and retreating shadow as it swept down the valley. A second party on the river witnessed the same phenomena. .A third party lost totality on account of clouds. On the steamer Active, lying in Anchor Bay, at the mouth of the Chilkaht, the ladies and gentlemen on board had a view of the whole of totality, and saw Mercury and several stars through breaks in the clouds. From them I obtained flketches of the relative positions of the sun, Mercury, and stars, by plotting the sun on section-paper and letting each person place the planet and stars where he judged that he saw them, using the sun's diameter as a measure of relative distance. It was remarkable how well they agreed; and as they saw stars as small as the 4th magnitude, pos. sibly some of the 4~th magnitude, I have made a sketch (Plate No. 25, Fig. 16) of such as were corroborated, and herewith annex it. None of these observers saw any break in the continuity of the disappearing or re-appearing edge of the sun ; some viewed it through opera-glasses.
" One person, situated in latitude 59" 10' and longitude 135° 26' woot, th&t ill, in the southern part of the.track of t.otality, noticed that the eorona was "wi(lel' nu the upper half of the sun than elsewhere.~

The next step was to use these results to find whether there was any constant tilt of the photograph-plates with reference to the optical axis of the telescope. For this purpose, tlie parallactic angle ZSN was calculateu from the ephemeris auu the known geographical position. From ::\Ir. Dean's ollsenations of internal contacts at Shelbj·vitle, the ephemeris was corrected, and the position-angles XSN for the cusps were fouml and corrected for differential refraction. Then, neglecting the difference between XSe andthe observed XOB (which, however, could eaRily lnffe been allowed for, if it had been of any consequence), we ba\eN08=X08-XSN and ZOB=ZSN +Noe Next, from the obserrntions of barometer and thermometer made during the eclipse and the calculated altitudes, the effect of simple refraction an<l of differential refraction upon the vertical and horizontal diameters of the sun were calculated from Bessel's refraction-ta~es; and from a preliminary reduction of the measures of the moon's limh on two photographs and approximate value for sM, the center of the moon; z, the zenith; N, the north pole; Y, the foot of a perpendicular let fall from M upon XO; U, the point in the heavens toward which the photograph faces. Where it is necessary, values for different photographs will be distinguished by subjacent nmn· bers; values for sun and moon by suhjacent 0 and ((; and values derived from the ephemeris and expressed in seconds will hani an accent, while values derived from the photographs and expressed in screw-revolutions will be written without an accent. I shall also write' R 8 for apparent radius of sun; R<r for apparen,t radius of moon; ,q for the number of seconds of arc in one revolution of the micrometer~screw; k calculated difference of the vertical and horizontal diameters of the sun, when the simple aml the differential refractions are allowed for, expressed in screw-revolutions; was obtained. From these the values of k were found. Then if there were no tilt, we should ha>eb=-ikcos 2N08 c=-ik sin 2 NOB This not being the case, we calculate-

ai·c tan~-NOB m 1 Then k will be the rnlue of the maximum elongation of the diameter prouuced by the tilt, and w will be the angle which the plane which passes through the photograph and the sun, and is perpendicular to the photograph, makes with the meridian. These values "\"\"ill not be constant in all the photographs on account of the adjustment" made in hour-angle. Therefore, I have calculated SU from the formula7,:'=.'.! R8 (sec SG-1) and then, in the spherical triangle N"CS, we hayc LNUS, side NS, and side sy known, and thence can calculate L CTNS and side UX Tllen the test of the hypothesis of a constant tilt is that UN +NS should be constant and that there should be a moderate range in the values of L UNS. On performing the calcnbtiun for the abo\e seventeen photographs, J found the result unsatisfactory. The tilt was often considerable, but had no fixed character. I learned that a number of different plate-holders were used, and I suppose they were not true. In the remainder of the dis· cussion I have necessarily supposed that there was no tilt, as the measures are not sufficiently nice, owing to the want of photographic achromatism, to base values of the two tilt-constants on each photograph singly. The next step was to correct all the measures of both sun and moon on six pl10tographs for the calculated vertical compression of differential refraction and horizontal compression of simple refraction. It was then assumed that the sun's and moon's limbs, so corrected, were circles. For the former, therefore, · .XO=a+c cos XO&+f sin .XO& The constants were calculated. For the moon we have l\IYO, a right angle. XO=XY+YO XY =XM cos YXM YO=_'.'.l\fO cos YO.\I so tlrnt XO=Xl\I cos YXl\1-::\:IO cos YO.:\I In order to prevent mistakes about the signs of YXl\f, geometrical figures were constructed for each photograph and used for reference. The sign changes with the change of Xl\'I-XO. We then get, with a few reductions, DxMXO= sec YXl\I D)rnXO=htn YXl\l sin (XOl:l-1\108)+ cos (X08-l\I08) DMoeXO=-l\10 cos (XOB-:MO&) tan YXM+J\IO sin (XOe-1\108) But the probable error of a measure of the radius-vector will Yary with the inclination of the radius-vector t-0 the normal to the limb; for by far the largest source of error of these measures is the blur of tlie outline. The error will, therefore, be proportional to the depth of tl1e hlur in the line of measurement, and, therefore, to sec YXl\L Dividing the equations of condition by this, they become_:_ corr. R« + cos (X08-:'.\f0&-YX1\I) corr. 1\10+1\:IO sin (X08-MO&- YX~I) corr. l\IOY + (calc. - meas.) XO=O In this way, the values of Re and MO were obtained from each photograp!.i. By means of the previously obtained e and/, the values of MS were next obtained. . The calculations being made, it was found that the values of the moon's railius, and consequently of the distance of the sun ·and moon, were quite uncertain, owing to the eccentric position of the origin, which deprived the measures near the cusps of much of their value, and also owing to all the measures being of one side of the moon only. In consequence of this, two of the photographs calculated were entirely rejected, and for the others the following method, confessedly defective, but the best possible under the circumstances, was adopted in the further discussion : Of the four photographs under consideration, two were taken before totality and two after.

I conclude that photographs measured in this way are practically of little value for eclipses. I had hoped that the snm of the sun's and moon\; radii would be given with accuracy, and by combining it with the rn.Jnes of the differences of the radii found hy'intcrnal contacts, as follows:

But not only have the circuinstances just narrated entirely destroyed this expectation, but, furthermore, it is evident that for some reason both the sun's and moon's semi-diameters are much too small, as given by the photographs------~--,--~--,-----~-------

In these obser\·ed Yalues of R' <r no correction bas been applied. The fact that both sun and moon are too small is, no doubt, t-0 be accounted for by the presence of the corona around the sun. Iu consequence of this, the most definite line in the blur produced by chromatic aberration about the limb of the sun will be on the inside, while on the limb of the moon the most definite line will.Qe nearer the light part of the photographic negative, that is, further out in reference to the suu.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THE MICROMETRIC MEASURES OF PHOTOGRAPHIC PlCTURES OF THE SOLAR ECLIPSE, OF AUGUST 7, 1869, TAKEN AT SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS. BY CHARLES A. SCHOTT, ASSISTANT, UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY. [Mr. Schott's "Report on the results of the micrometric measures of photographic pictures of the solar eclipse of August 7, 1869, taken at Springfield, Illinois," contains a ·profound discussion of the photographic method as applicable to eclipses and transits. The computations have been conducted with critical regard to all sources of error, and with a minuteness of detail which would not be recommended in the usual discussions of eclipses of the sun. But the results must be regarded as indicating the exceeding value of photographic observations in transits of Venus and Mercury, and their decided superiority in those cases to observationB of contact with eye and ear, as hitherto practiced.-B. P.] MAY 31, 1872. The necessity of procuring a micrometer suitable for the measure of photographs of the sun, the time spent in connection with the observations, in Europe, of the eclipse of December, 1870, the necessarily laborions task of measuring the photographs, and the lengthy computations required in their discussion were the principal causes of the delay in the presentation of this report. Nearly all the measures and computations were made by myself, at times ~hen least interfering with the ordinary duties of the computing division of the office. For the measures of the photographs, the Survey procured from Mr. L. M. Rutherford, of New York, a delicate micrometer, constructed from his own designs, and under his immediate supervision. This instrument (marked No. 3) was received June 25, 1870, and was immediately tested and adjusted for measures. Those finally retainE!d in the discussion were taken after my return from Sicily. The principal parts of the Rntherfurd micrometer are two steel screws, 61 inches in length, and 9 inch in diameter, containing about 48 threads to an inch, and working at right angles to each other; a horizontal, divided circle of 9 inches diameter, with two opposite verniers for angular measures; and a microscope attached to the frame-work, and moved by the two horizontal screws. The microscope is provided with two object-lenses, giving magnifying powers of 10 and 160 nearly. The photograph, or object to be measured, rests on a glass plate, connected with the axis of the horizontal circle. A test-plate for finding the value of a turn and division of the screws is supplied, as well as all necessary appliances for adjusting the parts of the instrument. The circle can be read to 10"; the micrometer-heads are divided into 100 parts, and these again are subdivided into 4 parts, and one-fifth of the distance of ·the latter may yet be estimated. The probable error of a single pointing, on a fine diamond line on the test-plate, with the cross-threads of the microacope, with a power of 10, equals ±0.0025 turn (nearly nho of an inch); with a power of 160, it equals ±0.0006 turn (nearly 80 h 0 of an inch), showing the probable error of pointing t-0 be inversely proportional to the square root of the magnifying-power. From a small number of measures, I find the value of one turn of the upper screw (its axis may be brought into the vertical plane passing through the axis of the circle) equal to 0.020835:1::0.000001 inch, at a temperature of 860 Fahren: heit; and one turn of the lower screw, equal to 0.020778 ± 0.000001 inch, at 350 Fahrenheit. In the metric system these results are : 1 turn of upper screw at 300 OC. =Omm,5292l:l:Omm.00002 1 turn of lower screw at 290,4 C. =0Wm.52776:l::Omm.oooos The values of a turn in different parts of the screws are sensibly equal. For the measures of the eclipse negatives a very moderate degree of magnifying-power suffices on account of the imperfect definition of the edge of the ft.Im of the collodion, due to granulation, and a power of 10 was found advantageous for judging of the most probable position of the outline. In the Springfield photo· graphs the image of the sun is nearly two-thirds of an inch in diameter (17mm.25). These phot-Ogra.phs {as already _stated, in my first report of October 4, 1869) were made by Mr. J. W. Black, of Boston; the plates were placed in the focus of the object-glass, and the time-record was obtained automatically by the breaking of a galvanic current aating upon the pen of ~ chronograph; the time of exposure was estimated at one-thirtieth of a second. Before measuring the photographs the

micrometer was carefully adjusted;· a few trials showed that measures of the chords (or distances beiween cusps) were of no value, nor were measures founded upon the width of the segment cut out by the projection of the lunar disk near the times of the contacts of any u~e for accurate work. The unequal spreading of the lighter over the darker surfaces, and the absence of a fixed scale for all the photographs may be considered as the principal causes of the failure of these modes of measures. In accordance with the method adopted for the treatment of the measures of the Shelbyville photographs by Mr. Charles S. Peirce, it was supposed that the undue spreading of light would increase the photographic radius of the sun as niuch as it would diminish that of the moon, and consequently would leave the distance of their centers _undisturbed; and, further, that the scale- . value may be obtained with the assistance of the known tabular motions (supposed correct) of the sun and the moon during the brief interval of the eclipse. Uniformity of treatment in measures and method of discussion was highly desirable, and the Springfield photographs were consequently submitted to the same process as those taken at Shelbyville; it will therefore suffice to refer the reader, for the full exposition of the method, to the report of Mr. Charles S. Peirce, on the result of the photographic operations conducted at the latter place. · In accordance with this method, six photographs were selected for measure (numbered hereafter from I to VI), the first and last being designed principally to furnish the scale value, and the others the corrections to the tabular difference of right ascension and declination of sun and moon. They are also selected symmetrically with respect to thG middle of the eclipse, presentillg three nearly equal and opposite phases. In photographs I and VI, the moon's center is projected about one-fourth of its radius outside the sun's limb; in II and V, it falls nearly in the middle of the sun's radius; and in III and IV, it approaches a little closer to the sun's center. The process of measuring may be briefly explained as follows: The photograph is placed nearly centrally on the glass plat.e, collodion side up, or facing the microscope, and focused. Next, the intersection of the threads is brought exactly over the center of the horizontal circle, or in its vertical axis produced, and the readings of the two screws in this position are noted. This was effectively done by means of four successive pointings, in azimuths 900 apart, on a small but well-defined speck selected at a short distance from the axis. The process is repeated until satisfactory. The microscope is then \eft untouched until the measures are completed and the readings of the center have again been verified. Each photograph is centered over the sun's center, and tested by revolving the circle, when the sun's limb must be kept bisected by the threads. All measures are taken with the upper screw, and with nearly the same part of the screw, t,he lower screw remaining at the reading of centering. In making the pointing, the last motion given is always in the same direction, to avoid any loose action. The following record will serve as a specimen of the measures: January 10, 1872.

Probable error of 1 moo~,

The above residuals are chiefly due to irregularities in the solar outline (difference of chemical action) and to the indefiniteness of the collodion outline caused by granulation. The variations noticed in the several values of r are also mainly due to the same causes, in addition to effects of difference in the condition of the atmosphere and in changes of refraction at the times of exposure. At the time of the first photograph the sun's altitude was nearly 30°, and at the time of the last photograph nearly 13io· The elliptical outline~of the photographed sun, as given by the co-efficients of the terms containing the cosine and sine of the double Jlngle, is compounded of that produced by the refraction and by any tilt in the plate, that is, by any want of perpendicularity of the face of the plate to the line joining the station and the sun. To correct for either deviation, we must know the value of the angle {J for the vertex. and for the north point; and since there is no fiducial line on the Springfield photographs, it became necessary to compute from the data of the ephemeris thepositionangle of the cusps, for which {} is known by measure, and then obtain the value of {}v and '9N by calculation. It is, however, desirable to use a corrected ephemeris, the result of the reduction of the" eye llind ear" observations of the four contacts at some stations selected as the most promising. This will at the same time afford means of comparing the results by the ordinary and by the photographic methods. In the following paragraph, Chanvenet's notation (as given in his Spherical and Practical Astronomy, volume 1, chapter ou Eclipses) will be used for convenience' sake, and the compntied tabular constants reqnired in the computation will be given in full, to assist those who may be engaged in the calculation of the large number of observations of this eclipse. ·

Each individual measure of the sun's limb was tuen corrected for simple and differential refraction, and the same was done for the measures of the moon's limb, with the addition of a correctiQn to the direction (8) for effect of differential refraction.

After correcting the preceding radii-vectores for eccentricity by means of the above equat~ons, the remaining deviations from a circular outline of the sun are presented in the annexed, table. In another arrangement the angles were all expressed, counting from the north point (round by west), and the deviations from a circlt1 in different photographs for the same (or nearly the same) point of the limb were compared; but be;vond an occasional coincidence in sign and quantity, no marked feature was noticed (in part, no doubt, due to solar rotation).

It was expected that the successive photographic radii would diminish (show less spread) with the decrease in the sun's altitude, though the smallest value is the last one, evidently other disturbing influences were at work. . We now come to the determination, from the measured directions and distances of points on the moon's outline, of the moon's photographic radius for each of the plates. These measures, taken

Here the moon:s outline is supposed circular, and the weights to each measure dtpend on the inclination of the direction of measure to the direction of the moon's radius (produced) at that point, and which inclination is equal to the angle /i. The measure of the maximum width of the moon's projection upon the sun for photographs I and VI, and of the maximum width of the crescent of light for phooographs II, III, IV, and V, have the unit weight; all others have Jess. Each photograpq thus furnished three normal equations determining the moon's radius (R), distance (.:1), and the direction ("J <r) from the origin of co-ordinates. The resulting series of remaining differences of computed and measured distances I have thought capable of still further improvement, and the values finally adopted are given below. The necessary introduction of weights' t-0 the measures on account of blur of outline in a measure opposed the condition which otherwise best determines the radius, thus especially in photographs I and YI, where the moon's outline is convex to the sun's center; the greater the angle {}-.'Ja (also the greater the angle p), the better the condition for the determination of R, but the worse the reliability of the measure itself, hence the necessity of applying to it the smaller weight.

These differences are necessarily greater than the corresponding uifferences referring to the solar outline, on account of the actual irregularities in the moon's figure. The values for the moon's photographic radius by pictures I and VI are evidently .defective, the cause of which is readily traceable to the limited length of lunar arc projected upon the sun at those times; the resulting radii from the intermediate pictures Il_to V present a tolerable accord, and, in order to render the first and last photographs in some measure available for the purpose intended, that is, for the determination of the scale-valne of the micrometer, I have taken the sum of the photographic radii of sun and moon from II to Y, or 331.131, and supposed this value to hold good also for I and VI, which givescons"equently .d 1 =24t.153 and "-1v=231.207. The probable error of R, as foul!ll from any single photograph (inclm1ive of I and VI) equals about ± 311 .5. Should the sun's actinic power be different near the ceuter arnl near the limb, a systematic deformation would result in the moon's photqgra1)hic outline, especially for cases I and VI; but, as the curvature must be affec.ted with the same sign, and the measured R ha·e a differ~nt sign of deviation in our pictures I and VI, they throw no light on this subject. Applying the known eccentricity, the measured distances of the centers of sun and moon for each of the photographs is deduced; and, comparing: them with the true distances computed from the ephemeris, corrected by observations with eye and ear at Bristol, Springfield, and Des Moines, we find the following scale-values for one turn of the micrometer:

Giving the weight one-half to the measured distances for photographs I and VI, the value for one turn of the micrometer would equal 58".20. A closer agreement between the individual values for one turn of the screw would be desirable; the differences, however, are not much greater than what might be expected from the uncertainties in the resulting lunar radii, for the determinations of which we llave, at best, less than.half a circumference which can be submitted to measure. Fpr the conversion of the measured distances into seconds, I prefer to use the value 57".94, deduci)d from II, Ill, IV, and V. The measured and computed distances of the centers of sun and moon then compare as follows:

While the results by the two methods may ham near!~· equal value, the labor required by the photographic method is yast1y greater, both in obser-l'ing and computing. By collating the results obtained from the Springfield and Shelbyville photographs of the eclipse, the latter gave an apparent correction to the moon's right ascension of -411 .8 nearly; the two values agreeing within their probable errors. Respecting the application of photography to the next transit of Venus, I would beg lea Ye to add a few remarks: In this case, where amount of labor is of no consequence, lH'O"Yided we obtain accurate results, we have the advantage of a complete circumference for perfecting the centering of the photograph, besides we may center on the sun as well as on the plauet. 'l'be perpendicularity of the face of the plate to the optical axis of the object-lens must be mechauically insured. A sharp outline can certainly be secured, since an examinatiou of micro-photographs showed no sign of granulation with a magnifying-power of ahont 50. · Respecting uucqual contraction of the collodion film, or distortion of the image, a glass plate, on which have been ruled parallel, equidistant lines, crossed by a second system of siIDilar lines at right angles to the first, ma;y be placed in the focus of the telel'lcope, and may be there adjusted to indicate on the photograph the direction of a vertical or of a declination circle, as the case may be; distortion of the collodiou film," if any, will be apparent in the photographed lines, and can be allowed for. In tile arrangement of the horizontal tube, as proposed by Professor Winlock, a fine plummet (silver thread) may be suspended in front of the collodion plate as near to it as can safely be done; its shadow will then be photographed together with the sun, and thus indicate the direction of the Yertical; if two such plummets, or a glass plate (set by spirit·level) with ruled lines, be employed, tlrn means will Le given for obtaining a value of the micrometer-screw independent of the diameter of the photoi;rnphed sun, which latte:\ could not be trusted for this irnrpose. These remarks arr only offt'red as suggestions in preparing for the work.

.A.DDITIO"N TO PltEOEDING REPORT.
In conformity with J·our note of tbe 10th of July, I have examined into the possible effect of the wearing of Rutherford's micrometer-screw on the measures of the eclipse-photographs. The temperature and light being favorable yesterday, I measured the distances of the four lines of the test-plate, using a magnifying-power of 160, first O\:er a part of the screw (reading 86 to 96) which hall seryed for more than a thousand measures, next over parts of the screw which had been comparatively little used (readings 68 to 78 and 104 to 114). In each case twenty measures of ten turns were taken; the distance of the test-lines 1 to 2 and 3 to 4 are r[6 of an inch (or half a turn nearly); of 1 to 3 and 2 to 41 Hof an inch (or ten turns nearly). A unit in the last place (3d) of decimals recorded is 4"!lboo of an inch very nearly. · I append a specimen of part of the record:

The effect of wear would probably show itself most in the probable error (the measures being half with motion forward and half with motion backward). The actual differences are sufficiently accounted for by the probable errors of measures ahd a possible irregularity in the screw, and do not seem, as yet, to indicate any injurious wear. Supposin au irregularity of 01.0004 in ten. turn s it1> e~ct on the measured radius of the photographed sun would be Ot.0006, which is equal to 0".03, one turn being nearly 5811 · This small quantity is of no consequence in the results reached. The measures of the photographs are nearly all comprised between the readings of the upper screw 91 and 101 (turns), and between these limits no possible defect could have crept into the results. [C.

APPENDIX No. 9.
REPORT ON THE RESULTS .FROM THE OBSERVATIONS l\I.ADE AT THE MAGNETICAL OBSERVATORY, ON CAPITOL HILL, WASHINGTON, D. C., BETWEEN 1867 AND 1869, BY CHARLES A. SCHOTT, ASSISTANT.

JUNE 29, 1869. The observations which form the subject of this report were undertaken with a view of keeping up a continuity of record of tile values of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity in this city, and principally for the better determination of the secular change. A small wooden observatory, 8 feet by 5, was erected in tlle garden adjoining the brick house at the corner of Second street east and 0 street south, on Capitol Hill, 1411 .± south and 21".l east of the center of the dome of the Capitol, or in latitude 330 53' 0611 .0, and in longitude 770 00' 14".6 west of Greenwich. The space being limited, subsequent additions made to a11joining buildings were found slightly to affect the declination, on which account the present system of monthly observation was terminated, after completing a series extending over two and a half years. The observations were made by myself, except in .January, February, and l\:1arch, 1867, when Assistant E. GoodfeIIow attended to thetn under my direction. In the computations I was assi8te<l by Mr. E. II. Courtenay. The regular days were the l±th, Uth, and 16th of eaeh month (if a Snuclay interfered the following da.r was included). Magnetic instruments.-The declination and horizontal intensity were determined with magnetometer No. 7, previously used at Eastport and Portland, Maine. The box containing the small collimator-magnet is mounted over a 6-inch horizontal circle, and the reading-telescope moves eccentrically. The magnets, during deflections, remain, according to Dr. Lamont's method, at right angles to each other. The declination-magnet is 3.6 inches long; the smaller magnet, suspended during deflections, is 3.0 inches long; their diameter is 0.3 inch, and the wc~ight sufficiently light to be suspended by a single fiber of uutwh;ted raw silk. The astronomical azimuth was determined with a 5-inch theodolite from observat.ionR of Polaris anrl the sun, as follows:

· A lightning-rod, on a house some distance off to the northward and nearly in the magnetic meridian, was used as mark. The intensity was determined by deflections and vibrations with regard to induction. The dip was measured with circle No. 10, having two position-needles, the axles of whieh can be turned, and were used in three positions each month. The circle is supplied with reading. microscopes, and the pointing is made on a small perforation in the needle. The polarity of the needles was reversed after one-half of the observations was completed. The instruments were mounted and dismounted each month, and but one was used at a time; all magnets and objects of iron, not in use, being deposited outside the observatory. Scheme of observing.-The declinometer was mounted and carefully adjusted the day before ea.ch term; the line of deoortion was determined, the mark pointed at, and the horizontal circle read; the scale was then read every quarter of an hour, from 7! a. m., in December, Jannary, and February; from 6f a. m., in March and April; from 6! a. m., in May, June, July,

and August; and from 6i a. m., in September, October, and November, in order to include the morning eastern elongation. When this was fairly passed~ or when the north end of the magnet hall fully commenced its westerly motion, the declination-readings were discontinued, and not resumed till about a quarter of an hour after 110011, when, after a new determination of the line of detortion, the westerly elongation was observed, and the observations were concluded after the easterly motion had fairly set in. The mark was read again. The axis of magnet A was determined eacll month. After the completion of the observations of the morning declination, the magnet was vibrated, and the time of 100 vibrations noted several times with the motion of the magnet from right to left, and again from left to right; deflections were next made, with the above magnet in the usual positions, relative to the center of the instrument. The deflection co-efficient P was carefully determined, as well as the induction and the temperature co-efficient. Time was noted hy mean-time chronometer Dent 2171, rated by means of the time-baU at the United States Naval Observatory. The dip was next measured, on the first day witl1 needles in position I, on the second day in position II, and on tlie third day in position III. The polarity was reversed in the middle of each set eacli day. 'l'he usual positions of face of needles itnd face of circle wne attended to. The upper and lower ends of the needle were read, one itfter pointing with the upper microscope on the yernier to the right, and the other after pointing with the lower microscope on the second vernier After reversing the cil'cle, the upper microscope was moved through twice the nadir distance of the complement of the dip. The bearings and the centering of the axles of the needles and the level of tlie instrument were attended to. These observations being concluded, those of declination were resumed, and the day's work brought to a close, generally between 2 and 3 o'clock p. m. Instnunental constants.-( a.) Value of a division of scale of magnet A. By first set, 2'.416; by second, 2'.479; by tl1ird, 2'.4±4; mean~adopterl, 2'.44. A small table of equivalents of scalediyisions was formed.

The moment of inertia of the magnet, &c., "Was determined by means of vibrations, without and with the ring, as follows: 7 sets of vibratio1rn, in April, gave K = 2.3368 at 68°.7 Fahrenheit; 6 sets in July, 2.3365 at 820.6; 11 sets in Deccm bcr, 1867, 2.335!) at 33°.1; and 12 sets in April, 1868, 2.3381 at "78°.8 . .'.\1ultiplying tlw weighted mean by r. 2 we find n 2K = 23.064 (1 0.0000136 [t - 620] ) :I: 0.012. This probable error produces a corresponding uncertainty in the value of the horizontal force x of ::l: 0.001:?, and, in the value of the magnetic moment m of magnet A, of ± 0.0001, or nearly its :nfoo part. The niJues of log ,.2K for various temperatures, between 320 and 920, were tabulated. (c.) Determination of the induction co-efficient.

*...A.. spare needle of ordinary construction was used in the place of posit.ion.needle No. l. In October a new axle wa.s supplied to needle No. 1. Poaltion-noedlo No. 3 was U&ed unaltered tbroughont the series. The meo.n by the two needles is given in the above table.

This diminution of the dip is in accor<lance with the observations at Toronto, Canada, where the dip increased up to 1859, and has sfoce been steadily decreasing. At Eastport, Maine, the dip was observed to be diminishing during the period 1860-'64; at Key West, Florida, the observations between 1860 and 1866 indicate a diminution. It appears from a former discussion· that the dip attained a minimum about 1842 on our Atlantic coast; from that time to about 1859, it was on the increase, when it unexpectedly reversed its motion and commenced again to diminish; possibly this increase during about seventeen years was only the effect of a secondary waw, masking for that time the general effect, which was decreasing the clip.

The horizontal force pre\ious to 1860 has been shown to have been on the decrease;* at Eastport, I.Iaine, however, the horizontal force was found to be increasing since the commencement of 1862, t the reversal having first been noticed at Toronto, in 1860, by Professor Kingston, director of the observatory. It wuulu seem th.at this increase is, perhaps, not ;yet. general along our Atlantic coast, since the observations at Key ·west, as late as 1866, hall not shown an;y incrf'asP, though it may ha-ve commenced in that year.

Values Nos. 2, 7, 9, marked·, would better be omitted in the discussion; they refer to Georgetown and to a locality affected by local disturbance. The Smithsonian grounds, also, are known to have a strong local disturbance. These results may readily be expressed in analytical form ; but, owing to our ignorane-0 of the cause or causes of the secular change, such expressions require continually to be remodeled, and it may be as well to wait for further accumulation of observations before undertaking a new discussion.

REPOUT OF THE SUPEHINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 10.
REPORT PPON DEEP-SEA DREDGINGS IN THE GL"LF STREAM DURING THE THIRD CRUISE OF THE UNITED STATES STEAMER BIBB, ADDRESSED TO PROFESSOR BENJAMIN PEIRCE, SUPERINTENDENT UNITED STATES CO.AST SURVEY, BY LOUIS AGASSI~.

The survey of the Gulf Stream, including soundings and dredgings in deep waters, had been going on for two years under your direction, when I was invited by you to join a third cruise. The surveying-party this year, as before, was accommodated on board the United States Coast Survey steamer Bibb, master commanding, Robert Platt, who bad charge of the hydrographic survey, while Assistant L. F. Pourtales, who had hitherto superintended the dredging operations, still continued to direct the same work. The object of my own connection with the present cruii;;e was to ascertain how far the last investigations covered the ground to be surveyed, and to what extent and in what direction further researches of the kind were desirable in the same region and likely to furnish important information. The work of :M:r. l 1 ourtales had been so eminently successful, the results obtaine<l in this short time so unexpected and of such high scientific value, that little more than a repetition, or perhaps, in some respects, a modification, of his results could be expected from my participation in this year's operations. It is a pleasure for me to state that our cruise-extending farther to the east in the Gulf Stream, between Cuba and the Bahamas on one side and Florida on the other, than those of previous years-confirmed in every feature the conclusions already reached by Mr. Pourtales. His results may, therefore, be considered as settled facts, deserving the fullest confidence of the scientific world, and requiring only, in order to obtain the appreciation they deserve, that kind of publicity which illustrated descriptions and maps can give them. When thus made known, it will be seen that we owe to the Coast Survey the first broad and comprehensive basis for an exploration of the sea-bottom on a large scale, opening a new era in zoological and geological research. I speak thus emphatically, because the data hitherto obtained concerning the animals of the deep sea have been rather isolated, and not methodically connected with one another and with a study of the inhabitants of shallower waters and the immediate sea-shore; nor have the previous coll~ctions been made over extensive areas and so combined that every :aewly surveyed point was determined with reference to earlier investigations, as was the case with the dredgings of the last two years. In your recent surveys of the Gulf, the dredging operations have· been pursued over an area so large as to preclude the possibility of any accidental and ill-considered conclusions. I should not speak in such terms of investigations in which I have had a share had not the main results been secured by :M:r. Pourtales before I joined the cruise. There can be no doubt now that the area occupied by the reef which rises to the surface of the ocean has a peculiar, independent fauna, totally distinct from that of deeper waters. To this area belong those spJJcies of corals known as tho truo builders of coral ;reefs, and to which, in a previous report to your predecessor, I gave, on that account, the name of reef-builders. The range of this fauna in depth is very limited; it does not extend below .ten fathoms, and is mainly occupied . by corals acquiring in their aggregate communities very large dimensions, such as Madrepora palmata, cervicornia, and prolijera, Porites astrreoides, Octtlina diffusa, Eusmilia fastigiata, Astrrea annularis and caverMsa, lsophyllia dipaaeea, Manicina areolata,, Oolpophyllia !J11roaa, M<ta1ulrina mammoaa, and other species of the genus, Diploria cerebrif<wmis, Sideraatrwa radians and aiderea, Agaricia agaricites, Mycedium elephani<>J>US, Millepora alcicornis, the coarser and larger kinds of Gorgonia, and a host of animals of all classes living in and upon the reef, among which Rhipidigorgiaftabelluni, Diadema antillarum, and Strombua gigaa are tQ6 most conspicuous. From this region {the only one of the kind which has been carefully surveyed by naturalists) I formerly secured those large and beautiful collections of corals which now adorn the Museum of Comparative Zoology.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SUlWEY.

209

Beyond this area, the width of which varies along the coast of Florida from a few miles, in the neighborhood of Cape Florida, to twelve, :fifteen, or twenty milet; and more off Cape Sable, we find another zone, rather sterile, or at all events not marked by that richness of animal and vegetabh~ life whfoh characterizes the reef range. The bottom of this second zone is a muddy mass of dead and broken shells, broken corals, and coarse coral-sand ; it is cltiefiy inhabited by worms, and such she1Is as by their nature seek soil of this character, with a few small species of li'l'"ing corals, some Halcyonarians, and a good many Algm. From the nature of the bottom of this zone, espcda11y at a depth of from twenty to forty fathoms, it is evident that a large number of dead mollusks and zoo1)hytes are scattered over its surface by the agency of the current:; and tides, after they have been broken up. I do not now enumerate the particular animals and plants found in this and the other sub· marine reg_ions herein described, because the work of identification is as yet very incomplete; moreover, some of the most common ancl characteristic species arc as yet neither described nor named, and would, therefore, be necessarily omitted in any list of the characteristic species of the Gulf Stream fauna. Indeed, for the present;. such a list could 011ly be an enumeration of species with which naturalists have become acquainted from specimens cast ashore, and would give no idea of the actual living faume in their natural habitat. On that account it is particularly desirable that the scientific harvest of these surveys should speedily he made knmm, accompanied hy the fullest illustrations ..i; · · .A. third region or zone, beginning at a depth of about fifty or sixty fathoms, and extending to a depth of from two hundred to two hundred and fifty fathoms, constitutes a broad slanting table· land, beyond which the sea-bottom sinks abruptly into deeper wat-0rs. The floor of this zone is rocky; it is, in fact, a limestone conglomerate, a kind of lumachellc, composed entirely of the solid remains of organized beings, a true concretionary limestone, such as we might find in several levels of the Jurassic formation, and more especially in that horizon whicll geologists call "Coral Rag." \Ve have here a plateau extending for more than a hundred miles, beginning off the. Marquesas aua stretching to Cape Florida, corresponding to Coral Hag. It -rnries from eight to ten, twelve, or twenty miles in width-the greatest spread facing Sombrero..-and is built up entirely of animals now living upon its surface, and constantly increasing the thickness of the bed by their accumula· tion. Large fragments of this rock were brought up by the dredge; so that its structure and characteristic remains of animals could be studied at leisure. I do not know that there is on record in the annals of our science a more direct illustration of the manner iu which mountain masses of cafoaroous deposits· have been accumulatd on the bottom of the ocean. The animals inhabiting this plateau are innumerable, and as varied as those found along the shores most fertile in animal productions. .A. great variet,y of eorals occur there, all of small size, and, strange to say, belonging to genera nev~r known before from our sea-shores. Their aggregate affinity is, indeed, not with the living corals, but rather with the types of the tertiary and cretaceous periods. Echinoderms are equally numerous; they are also small as compared to those found nearer shore, and likewise recall, by their zoological afilnities1 the types characteristic of the creta{)eaus period. Salenoid and Discoidea.-like forms, never known among living Echinoderms before, have been discovered on this plateau. Among mollusks I may mention one species-the Voluta Jmionia, hitherto considered the rarest shell from the southern coasts of the United States, and known only from a ·ery few worn specimens. Of that species, which is particularly interesting on account of its close affinity with Voluta Lamberti of the Crag, and with Voluta mumbilis of the Miocene beds of Virginia and Maryland, quite a number of living specimens, young and old, Irn.ve been brought up by the dredge. Two species of .Brachiopods-Terebratula eubensis, Pourt., and Waldlwimia :ftoridamt, Pourt., arc, extremely oommon 1 and contribute greatly to give this fauna an antique charactilr. Most of the other molluSks have not yet been identified. Worms and crustacea abound also, and a few fl.shes unknown to me have also been obtained. All these are still undetermined.
· Thll corals found iu the two ll&rlier cruisee are dlilscrlbed by .III· .Pourtales, in Noe. 6 and 7 of the BUlletin, pp. 103141. A. preliminary report on the Echinoderms is printed in No. 9 of tho Bulletin, Pl" 253-361. A.s I ha.ve not ennmer· ated the 11pecie& therein deecribed, it may not be out of place here to remark that, though I have ma.de some additions llinee, thil! report WM p~pal'ed heforo Nos. 9, 10, 11, and 12 of the Bulletin had lHJon handed in. Tho reminks upon the growth of corals were written iltlmediately after my return from Florida, in May last.

REPORT·OF THE SUPERINTENDE:NT OF

The extraordinary richness, profusion, and variety of animal life displayed upon this table-land amazed me, not only on account of the peculiarity of the types, but from the vast number of individuals found together. The dredge coming up from such a depth, laden and crowded with all sorts of liYing creatures, as if it had been dragged in shoaler waters, was indeed a rare and startling sight for a naturalist. Such a result is the more unexpected, on account of the current impression, fostered by Edward Forbes's and Captain Mc.Andrew's extensive dredging operations in the hJgean Sea, that as we descend below the surface of the ocean animal life gradually and steadily diminishes, till in deep waters it entirely fades away. As we have already seen, this is not the case, and Uaptain lilcAndrew has himself lately helped to dispel the illusion. Nevertheless, -it is true that a change is perceptible in the character and size of animals inhabiting respectively deeper and deeper waters, as compared with those of the shallow coast zone. It may very justly, be said that we have in the sea something corresponding to the alpine and subalpine flora, when contrasting higher levels with the plains; only that our submarine deep-water florn, or, rather, fauna, consists mostly of creatures hitherto little known, or even entirely unknown. It is a surprising fact that the variety of marine plants does not keep pace with the variety of animals; they make a poor show when compared with the many and diversified sea-weeds found in the littoral mud-flats and upon shoal rocky bottoms. The sponges, however, thrive in deep waters better than the ordinary alg:.e; but the large aud valuable sponges now gathered in such quantity along the whole coast of :Florida are found on the littoral shoals only. In lleep water we find, with a variety of larger species, a great number ~f -small species of the same type, and among them a diminutive Hyalonema. Permit me a suggestion here. You have repeatedly commemorated the discovery, by officers of the Coast Survey, of some submarine ledge or ridge, or peculiar configuration of the sea-bottom, by associatiug their names with the field of their operations. It would. be appropriate and just that this extensive coral plateau, the characteristic fauna of which ::\L Ponrtales has so faithfully explored, should bear his name and be called the "Pourtales Plateau." To the seaward of this coral table-land, the bottom sinks rapidly to a depth of four or firn hundred fathoms, reaching even eight hundred fathoms aJl(l more, though our succ"<ssive dredgings have hardly extended beyond seven hundred fathoms. Over the whole of this area, which properly con~titutes the lower floor of the Gull' Stream, the sea-bottom presents a uniform accumulation of thick, adhesiYe mud," in which animal life is much less profuse than upon the coral plateau. It cannot, however, be assumed that this diminution of life is owing to the depth and consequent pressure of the water, or to the absence of light, but rather to the nature of the soil; for we find in it many animals to which such a habitat is congenial-a variety of worms, for instance, and such shells as seek muddy bottoms. I have not the least doubt that a rocky foundation at eight hundred or even a thous;rnd and more fathoms would yield a large harvest of animals; unquestionably fewer than are found in shallower waters, but yet as varied and as numerous comparatively as are the alpine plants on the very limits of perpetual snow, wherever, in various latitudes, that vegetation can be compared with the flora of lower levels. If we have not succeeded in finding such a fauna in the deepest waters of the Gulf Stream, I hold that the cause lies chiefly in the absence of rocky bottoms in the deepest parts of the basin through which the great current of our southern coast flows. The character of the mud in the channel of the Gulf Stream does not warrant the supposition that the mud deposits derived from the turbid waters of the Amazons and Orinoco have extended as far north as the Gulf of Mexico, even though the great equatorial current sweeps past the months of these rivers. There is one subject of scientific rei;earch, the connection of which with deep-sea soundings cannot fail to lead to unexpected results. When attempting to explain the structure of the stratified rocks, and many other phenomena connected with the general appearance of the earth's surface, geologists have not hesitated to ascribe, in a general way, the facts under observation to the agency of water; but they have rarely entered into such specific details as would establish a causal
·When drietl, this deep-sea mnd, with its innumerable and characteristic FQraminifel'a, remarkably resembles the chalk-marls of the cretaceous formation. 'fhe green-sand formation I have not investigated myself, but it has been minutely studied by Mr. Pourtales, who lms nscertained tl1at it is the resnlt of a peculiar alteration, disintegration, and fin11.l aggregation of Ji'oraminife.-a.

connection between all these facts, and the cause appealed to. In proportion as the sea-bottom becomes more extensively known, and the cliaracter of the materials I;riug beneath the water and their mode of arrangement arc ascertained with greater precision, more accurate comparisorn~, in consequence of whicll current ·dews may ham to undergo considerable modifications, will certainly he made between geological formations of past ages, including all their deposits of various kinds, and the materials at present scattered in special ways over the ocean floor. Ifrom what I have seen of the deep-sea bottom, I am already led to infer that among the rocks forming the bulk of the stratified crust of our globe, from the oldest to the youngest formation, there are probably none which have been formed in Ycry deep waters. If tliis be so, we shall hase to admit that the areas now respectively occupied by our continents, as circumscribed by the two hundred fathom curve or thereabout, and the oceans, at greater depth, have from the beginning ietained their relati-rn ouiline and position; the continents ha;\ing at all times been areas of gradual upheaval with comparath~ely slight oscillations of rise and subsidence, and the oceans at all times areas of grauual depression with equally slight oscillations. Sow that the geological constitution of our continent is satisfactorily known oYer the greatest part of its extent, it seems to me to afford · the strongest evidence that this has been the case; while there is no support whateYer for the assumption that any part of it has sunk again to any very great depth after its rise above the sm· face of the ocean. The fact that upon the American continent, east of the Bocky Mountains, tht geological formations crop out, in their regular. succession, from the. oldest azoic awl iwimordial deposits to the cretaceous formation, without the. slightest indication of a great suhse<Jlient subsidenc<:>, seems to me the most complete an<l direct demonstration of my proposition. Of the western part of the continent, I am not prepared to speak with the same coufidence. J\IoreoYer, the position of the cretaceous and tertiary formations, along the low grounds east of the Alleghany range, is another indication of the permanence of the ocean trougll, on the margin of which these more recent beds have been formed. I am well aware that in a comparatively recent period portions of Canada and the United States, which now stand six or se\·en hundred feet above the level of the sea, have been under water; but this has not changed the configuration of the continent, if we admit that the latter is in reality circumscribed by the two hundred fatl1om curve of depth. Geologists have appealed very freely to oceanic currents as accounting for the presence of loose materials upon the surface of the earth. But now that the actual mode of distribution of such loose materials, under the action of extensive and powerful currents, hegins to be known, those who. explain the facts in this way are bound to sl1ow that their arrangement actually agrees with tile effects of oceanic currents. I must confess that I have looked in vain, in the trough of the Gulf Stream, for traces of the characteristic mud which pours from 'the mouth of the Amazons in quantities sufficient to discolor the waters of the ocean for a great distance from shore; and ;yet the equatorial current of the Atlantic is one of the greatest and most powerfnl of all known currents. Another side of this subject is also immediately connectetl with deep-sea soundings. Geologists, and especially those of the school of Lyell, have again and again assumed the slow rising of extensive tracts of land from beneath t,he water, and taken all sorts of loose materials irregularly scattere<l over the surface of the land as evidence of its former submersion. But since tlie dredge lias been applied to the exploration of the deep, and a gre-1t Yariety of animals, in a profusion rivaling that of shoal waters, have been brought up, not only from the immediate Yicinity of the land, but at various distances, in increasing depth, from one to two and even many hundred fathoms, no obsen'er is justified in considering extensirn deposits of loose materials as marine in which no trace of marine organic remains is found. Tl1e very mud and sand of the <leep teem with innumerable microscopic, living beings, the solid parts of which are easily detected in the smallest samples of marine deposits, and may therefore afford a satisfactory test where larger animals or plants are wanting. Now, after surveying the whole width of our western prairies, without find- _ ing anywhere a sign of marine animals or plants, I cannot see that there is any evidence of their marine origin, or of the influence of oceanic currents ii~ accumulating or distributing the loose materials scattered over those vast plains. On the other hand, I have ascertained that the foundation rock, upon which these materials rest, is everywhere polished, grooved, and scratched in the same characteristic manner as the well-known glaciated surfaces, wherever exposed. I have seen

212

REPORT OF THE SUPERrnTENDENT OF

such polished rocks in the Yalley of the River Platte, not far from Omaha, and am now satisfied that the whole extent of the country, between the Alleghanies and the Rocky Mountains, was one unbroken glacier bottom. The scratched pebbles found among the loose materials of the great prairies confirm this view .. For similar reasons, I am satisfied that the valley of the .Amazons has uot been under. the level of the ocean since the t~rtiary period. The most perplexing feature disclosed to me by our deep-sea dredgings and by my observations of the sea-shores along the Gulf Stream, on the Florida and on the Cuba sides, is the irregularity of the stratification of the Spanish banks as compared with the deposits on the .American side. Taken as a wli,ole, the trough of the Gulf Stream, between Cuba and Florida, as well as farther east and north, presents features in its configuration widely different from the relief of any equally extensive area, of the dry surface of our continents. The floor of this basin is gradually and slowly shelvin,g from the Florida coast to greater and greater depth, while on the Cuban side it is rapidly rising agai11. The slope is, indeed; so rapid on the Spanish shore that, at a distance of less than two miles from the abrupt shore bluffs, the depth of the trough is generally from 3,000 to · 4,000 feet, and here anc1 there reaches 5,000 feet at a slightly greater distance. We have thus here a slope as steep as that of the steepest mountain ranges of that height, and even steeper; and, what is most sUFprising, the great inclination of this floor is not the result of uplifted and slanting beds of rock, but unmistakably the effect of the abrading action of the·great current upon older coral formalions, .Judging from the aspect of the shqre bluffs, and their evident continuity with the general sl9pe from the water-edge down to the greatest depth reached with the plumb-line and the dredge. This difference in the inclination of tirn slopes on the American ancl on the Cuban sides of the basin obtains for more than one hundred miles-from the Tortugas to Cape Florida-with the peculiarity only tliat in the direction of Salt Key Bank there rises, on the Cuban side, a low ridge from the deeper part of the trough, trending nearly parallel with the coast. Another remarkable feature of the edge of the ~reat Florida reef consists in its having a less abrupt slope to the seaward than is ascribed to all the coral reefs of the Pacific Ocean. Nevertheless, the seaward slope of the reef is really steeper than the shorew;ard slope; and this is, it appears, an essential element in the growth and rise of all the coral reefs. But while the great coral reef of Florida presents this exceptional character, the Bahamas and the reefs to the northeast of Cuba, exhibit very abrupt slopes, and a great depth is reached close to the shores of these banks; so that the Bahamas resemble the coral-reefs of the Pacific much more ·than the reefs of the coast of Flol"ida. The whole group of banks and. keys embraced between Double-headed Shot Key, Salt Key, and Anguilla Key is a very instructive combination of the phenomena of building and destruction. The whole gronp is a flat bank covered by four or five and occasionally six fathoms of water, with :fine sand,y bottom, evidently corals reduced to oolithes of various sizes, from fine powder to coarse sand, mingled with broken shells, among which a few living specimens are occasionally found. The margin of the bank is encircled on several points by rocky ridges of the most diversified appearance, and at others edged by sand-llunes. .A close examination and comparison of the different keys show that these different formations are in fa.ct linked together, and represent various stages of the accumulation, consolidation, and cementation of the same materials. On the -:fiat top of the bank the loose materials are pounded down to fine sand; in course of time this sand is thrown up upon the shoalest portions of the bank, and it is curious to notice that these shoalest parts are its very edge, along -which corals have formed reefs which have become the basis of the dry banks. The foundation rock, as far as tide, wind, and wave may carry the coarser materials, consists of a conglomeration of coarser oolithes, rounded fragments of corals, or broken shells, and even larger pieces of a variety of corals and conchs, all the species being those now found living upon the bank, among which Strombus gigas is the most common; beside that, Astraia annul.aris, Si<lcrastraa siderea, and Mreandrina mammosa prevail. The shells of Strombus are so common tliat they give great solidity and hardness to the rock. The stratifteation is somewhat irregular, the beds slanting toward the 8ea at an angle of about seven degrees. Upon this foundation rock immense masses of Strombus, dead shells, and corals have been thrown in banks, evidently the beginning of deposits similar to those already consolidated below ; but there is this dlll'erence in their formation, namely, that while the foundation rook is slightly inclined, and never rises above

the level of high water, the accumulation of loose materials above water-le\el forms steeper banks, Yarying from fifteen to twenty and thirty degrees. In some localities broken shells preYail, in other, coarse and fine. sand; and the ridges thus formed, eYidently hy ihe action of high wrm.>s, rise to about twelYe and fifteen feet. Tllis is evidently the foundat.ion for tlie accumulation of finer sand driven by the wind O\er these ridges and forming high saucl-dunes, held together by a Yariety of plants, among which a trailing Yine, (Batatas Titforalis,) Yarious grasses and shrul1s am the most conspicuous. These tlunes rise to about twenty feet; on their lee-sitle and almost to their summit grows a little palmetto. The sand of the tlunes is stil1 loose, but here and there shows a tendency to incrufltation at the surface. 'l'he slope of these dunes is rather steep, sometimes oyer thirty degrees, and steeper to tbC'seaward than on the landward side. In the interior of Salt Key there is a pool of intensely salt water, the tint of which i:-; 1>inkish or flesh-colored, owing to the accumulation of a little Alga. "-hen agitated hy tlle wind, tl1is pool is hedged all round by foam of the purest wl1ite, arising from the frothing of the viscom; water. Along the edge the accnmula.tion of this microscopic plant forms large cakes, not unlike decaying meat, aud of a Yery offensive OL1or. The foundation rock of tllis key ii:: exactly like what Gressly described as the ''facie8 corallicn" of the Jurassic formation; while the deposit in de('P water, consisting chiefly of muddy lime particles, answcr8 to his "facies 1Jase11x.'' Double-headed Shot Key is a long, erescent-sliaped ridge of rounded knolls, not unlike " ror:l1es 11wuntonnecs," at intervals interrupted by breaks, Ro that the whole looks like a dismantled wall, lJroken down here and there to the water's edge. The whole ridge is composed of the finest oolitlies, pretty regularly stratified, but here and there like torrential deposits; the stratification is more distinctly yisible where the roeks have been weathered at the surface into those rugged and furrowed slopes familiarly known as "l.'al'ren" in Switzerland. It is plain that we have here the same fornmtion as on Salt Key, only older, with more thorouglily cemented materials. The uniformit.r of the minute oolithes leaves no doubt, tlrnt the sand must haYe been blown up b.r tho wind and accnnmlated in the form of high dunes before it became consolidated. The general aspect of Doubleheaded Shot Key is very different from that of Salt Key. The whole surface is barreu-not a tree, hardly a shrnh, and the scantieRt creeping \egetation. The rock is yei·y hard, ringing under thfl ham·mer, and reminds one of the llald summits of the .T ura, such as Tete tle Rang, near Ln. Ohaux-<11:>Foml. It is evident that what is beginning ou Salt, Key Juts 11ere been not only completed, bn tis undergoing extensiYe disintegration in Double-headCLl Shot Key, both by the action of atmospheric agents over the surface and by the action of tides :cml wimls against the base of the key. Among these older oolithic deposits, forming the main range of Orange Key and of Donhleheaded Shot Key, we recognize formations of more n~cent date, occupying the ca\ities of ancient pot-holes, which have gradually been filled with mafodals identical with those of the oldertleposits. The pot-holes themseh-es show nothing very peculiar; there are nrnu:y Emch upon these keyssome large ones many yards in diameter ancl others quite small-evidently formed by the wearing action of loose pieces of harder coral rocks thrown upon the key hy great waves, and only occasionally set in motion hy the waters dashing owr the key during heavy storms. The iiot-hoks nearest the water-edge are the most recent, and are mostly clean exe:wations, either entirely empty or containing sand ai;itl limestone pebbles l,ving loose at the bottom of the holes. Some of thefle excavations are circular, others oblong, still others hM·e the form of wi!Hling caves op!·ning toward the sea or upon the surface of the key. Beyontl the reach of Gnlinar.) tides and of the waves raised by moderate winds~ the pot-holes are generally lined with coa.t,iugs of solirl, compact, and hard limestone, varj-ing from a thin layer to a deposit of Se\-cral inches in thickness, and following all the sinuosities of the cavities in which they are accumulating. It is plain from their structure that these coatings are a subaerial formation, increasing br the succel'isirn accumulation of limestone particles left upon the older rock by the evaporation of water thrown upon the key when the ocean is so violently agitated as to dash over the whole ke.r. Frequently the hollow of these coated pot· holes is further filled with consolidateu·oouthes; or·thin layers of minute oolithes al~rnate with a coat of compact limestone, throughout the excavation, which often has been filled again in this way np to the general level of the snrrountling surface. Oecasionally these regenerated surfaces are again hollowed out by the a.ction of storms, and the result is a dismantled pot-hole, in which their structure and the mode of their filling are distinctly exhibited.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The stratification of the main mass of these key~ is 1ery peculiar. Though e.i<lently the result of an accumulation of oolithes thrown up by high waves, the beds arc pretty regular in themselves, but slant in every direction toward the sea, showing that they were dtlposited uni1er the actiou of winds blowing at different times from every quarter. It is further noteworthy, that~ while the thicker layers consist of ooli Llies reauily clistingnisl~able to tlte naked eye, tlicre are at iutervals thin layen; of very hard, compact limestone, alttm1ating with the oolitl:ic strata, which have no doubt been formed in tl:e same manner as the coating of the pot-holes. As in their general aspect the coral forma.tions of the Cuban si!le of the Gulf Stream differ from those of the American side, so do also the rocks of the latter differ from the rocks observed upon the hanks of Salt Kc>,y, Double-headed Shot Ke~-, and 0mnge Ke,y. We find upon tlie Florida reefs, as m·.11 as between the innumerable keys stretching along the American coast, and upon the coral plateaa sloping· toward the main trough of the Gulf Stream, extensive beds of regularly stratified rocks of nn·ious kin<ls. I hayo already described the limestone conglomerate of the Pourtales plateau. Such a formation exists nowhere else within the range of the Gulf Stream, unless it should lie hereafter ascertained that ~· similar deposit extends al011g the snbmarhte bonier of our continent, edging the American wall of the deeper part of the Atlantic trough. nut iu the shoal waters interrnning between the coast of the penimmla of Florida and the ke;ys auu reefs there exist Yarious de1)0sits of an entirely different structure, the .accumulation and increase of wllich arc constantly going on. The most extensive of these formations is a regnlarl:r stratifie1l oolithic rock, Urn grains of which vary from imperceptible gnrnules to larger and larger oolithes, approaching the dimensions of pisolithes, and cemented together by an amorphous mass of limestone mud. The oolithes themselves arc formed in the manner first described by Leopold Yon Buch. Hard particles of the most heterogeneous materials, reduced to the smallest tlimensiorm, arnl tm;sed to and fro in water charged with lime, are gradually coated with a thin film of limestonl', and tlien anot11er aud another, until they sink to the bottom, to ue further rolled up down the sloping shore-bottom until they become cemented with other similar grains, and form part of tlte growing limestone bed. Of course the finer oolithes are seen nearest the shore-line, aud it is instructive to see at low tide the little ripples of successive larger oolithes left dry as the water subi,;ides. Naturally these materials are frequently thrown up along the beaches in layers of' Yarying thickness, and in course of time become cemented, and are transformed into solid rock, oyer which crusts of lrnrd, compact limestone are in the end formed by the eYaporation of calcareous water dashed upon the dry surfaces. In Yery shallow waters, which are not powerfully affoctell by tiual mo>·ements, and upon the hottom of whieh no oolithes me forming, we find extensive beds of a dull amorphous limestone, formell of lime-mud, al~ernating with seams 'of a more compact, _hard limestone, in which a few oolithes may occasionally be seen that were floated 01er the flats in.which such formations are going on. 'l'hese deposits resemble the marly limestone of the Oxford beds. Of course these different roeks may alteruate with one another, as, owing to the increase of the whole formation, the conditions for the deposition of one kind of rock may be followed by those favoring another combination. Again, in consequence of the changes in the uircction of the currents, or as the result of a heavy gale, considerable deposits which haYe been going Oil regularly for a long time may suddenly be worn away and destroyed, giYing rise, in turn, to the formation of conglomerates made up of limestone fragments of 1arious structure, united together into very peculiar conglomeratic 1mdding-stone, witl1 angular rnateria1s. The compact limestones are frequently as hard as the 11ardest limestones of the secondar.}' formation, have a conchoidal fracture like the most compact l\'Iuschelkalk of the Triasic l)eJiod, and may ring under the hammer. Most of the keys consist of broken corals thrown up by the waves, including fragments of shells, sea-urchins, and occasionally bones of sea-turtles and fishes. At the Dry Tortugas and at tlie Marquesas, however, some of the keys are entirely made up of the decompose~ fragments of corallines cen;tented together. The crescent-shaped joints of a large species of Opuntia are most prominent among them. Nowhere within the range of the Gulf Sti·eam and its borders have I seen a rook which could be supposed to have been formed by the materials accumulating in the greater depth of its trough, such as I haye described above, page 210. And no rock in the whole Jurassic formation oonldhave

THE filJ:TED STATES COAST SURVEY.

215

been formed out of the kind of materials which are found in the deeper parts ot the Atlantic basin, along the American shores; I therefore do not belieni that any of tlrn rocks of the Jura and the Suabian Alp ha>e been depositod in >ery deep waters. The extensive area occupied hy tlic keys and reefs of Florida, including the sloping coral plateau of the American side of the Gulf Stream bottom, may fairly be compared to the Jurassic formation, as it stretches across Central EllI'ope and farther east, in the direction of the Caucasus and Himalaya l\'.Iountains. Indeed, the Jurassic formation, as a whole, bears the same relation to the older ue11~sits upon which it rests, as the motlern American coral formation sustains to the older parts of the coast of our continent. During the geological mitldlc ages, the Jurassic fornia· tion was the submarine margin of a growing continent, as the I'omtalcs plateau forms at present the southern margin of North America. These facts have an immediate bearing upon the question of the origin of submarine basins as compared with the inequalities of the mainland. The configuration and relief of onr continents, as far as they are not tl1e result of later denudations, ha>e been determined hy uplifts and the gradual rise of the lantl above the level of the sea, and hence have arisen the fractnreu ridges of mountain ranges, with their n1)right crests; wl!ilc the areas of the great oceanic basins arc surfaces of depression or subsidence, upon which prominent inequalities woultl of necessity be wanting, from the very fact that the breaks, where any occurred, must be turned downwartl. If this Yiew is correct, it naturally follows that the main outlines and circumscription of the continents and of the oceans must have been determined at the very beginning of the formation of inequalities upon the earth's surface, and remained essentially the same through all geological ages, yarying onl.r as to their relative height aml depth, as well as to their respective extension. Such considerations enable us now to raise the question of the age of the Gulf Stream. Our present knowledge of the atmospheric and oceanic currents justifies the assumption that, owing to the rotation of the earth upon its axis, and taking for granted that the latter has ueyer changed its poles, the great equatorial currents, fostered by the trade-winds, must flow in an east-westerly direction, and be fed by northerly and southerly polar currents slanting westward towarll the equator. As long as the chain of the Andes tlitl not iutercept the Atlantic equatorial current, it must have been continuous with the great Pacific current; and, as stated by A. Agassiz, in another report, there is palreontological evidence that during the cretaceous period the through el.Jannel was still open. I may add that I have myself seen the eYi<lcnce, along tlw base of the lfocky Mountains, and on the western bor<lers of the Amazonian ValleJ·, of the post-cretaceous elevation of the great mountain range which rises like a huge barrier on the westc:!'n side of the North and South American Continents, dividing the l'acific water-shed from that which feeds the Atlantic. 'We are thus justifietl in assuming that, even during the cretaceous period, there existed a great North Atlantic current, flowing from the northeast in a southwest direction, and that the Uulf Stream has assumed its J>rcsent course in the opposite direction since that period; that iil, since the Rocky Mountains and Andes have joined ha11ds across Central America. This result adds greatly to the interest excited by the cretaceous and tertiary chriracter of some of the animals discovered by l\I. Pourtalcs in the deeper parts of the Gulf Stream. 'L'he true significance of this fact is, however, too foreign to this report to jnstify a discm;sion of its bearing u1lon the question of the ocigin of the present faunm. It would be of the highest importance to ascertain, by actual obscrYation, the whole extent of the range of the cleep-sea fauna recently discovered in the Gu1f Stream, between the coasts of Florida and Cuba. To secure this information, a great amount of dredging must he done from the eastern shores of the United States to the dee1)cst waters of the Atlantic Ocean, all along the coast from Florida to our Northern States. Until such a comprehensive surwy lrns been carried out, wo can only combine, as well as we may, the sc.'tnty data on hand, in our attempt to form any idea of the northerly extension of the animals now known to exist in that part of the Gulf Stream flowing between Florida, Cuba, and the Bahamas. Happily the English and the Scandinavian naturalists have already collected a vast amount of information concerning the marine faunre of the coasts of Norway and the British Islands, and the recent expeditions undertaken by the Swedish and by the English governments, with a view of exploring the greatest depths of the Atlantic Ocean, cannot fail to afford the most valuable means of comparison between the faunm of the two silles of the

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Atlantic in different latitudes. From the reports of the British Association for Advancement of Science, from the publications of Professor Sars, from the reports of Professors Carpenter, Thomson, and Jeffreys, and from the private communications received from Dr. Smitt and Mr. Ljungman, the natmalists of the Swedish man-of-war Josephine, which recently visited the harbor of Boston, we have been able to ascertain that some of the species of our deep-sea animals of Florida are found far to the north of the British Islands, on the western coast of Norway, and near the Azores, upon the newly discovered" Josephine Bank." Now all these stations lie in the course of the Gulf Stream, as it divides into a northern or Scandinavian and a southern or Lusitanil! branch, after crossing obliquely the Atlantic Ocean from our own shores, in the direction of Ireland; and the question naturally arises, is not this wide distribution of the Florida µeep-sea fauna to be directly ascribed to the agency of the Gulf Stream'! It can hardly be otherwise, at least within certain limits. But at the same time we must not forget that, in a comparatively recent period, the main motion of the North Atlantic must have been in a north-southerly direction, and that to this day there is a great northern current of cold water sweeping past the eastern shores of the United States; while the southern branch of the Gulf Stream flows in a southerly direction, past the western shores of Southern Europe; so that we may expect a strange mixture of arctic and subtropical animals in the great unexplored depths of the Atlantic, between America and Europe. It is to be hoped that the zeal with which the exploration of the deep ocean has begun may not flag before the whole problem is solYed. One of the most important results of this year's cruise, though not exclusively derived from deep-sea soundings, deserves a special mention in this report. Taught by former investigations, upon other classes of aniqials, that in their affinities anu relative standing organize(} beings exhibit direct relations not only to the changes they undergo while growing, but also to their succession in past ages, and to their present dis~ribution upon the surface of the eartli, I lost no opportunity of ascertaining to what extent these relations may also be traceable among the corals. From their simpler organization, and the less prominent differences which distinguish their numerous representatives, it seemed hardly probable that ·facts could be ascertained plainly bearing upon these questions; and yet, the moment I proceeded with the investigation, I perceived that there was before me a vast fieIU, thus far entirely unexplored, from the survey of which much valuable information could be secured. A fortunate circumstance unexpectedly favored my res~arcbes. In consequence of injuries to a breakwater adjoining Fort Taylor, a large number of granite blocks, which had been three years under water, were hauled up on shore, and I found them covered with a great number of specimens of different species of corals, in various stages of growth. The surfaces of the granite were still so clean that it was possible to detect the smallest young corals upon them, and to trace so many stages between them and larger ones as to leave no doubt of their specific identity. I made, with the assistance of nI. Pourtales, a large collection of these young corals, which I afterwards leisurely compared with one another and with adult stocks of the same species. The result of this comparison I may express in few words: Corals undergo a succession of changes peculiarly their own, and yet hardly less marked than the embryonic changes already known among many animals. If we combine into·a series all the changes thus far observed among different families of corals, an unmistakable gradation appears among them, akin to, the series which may b~ traced among other animals in their adult condition, when we take the complication of their structure as a standard of their arrangement. Combining the evidence obtained from adult coral stocks, and tlreir young at various stages of growth, it becomes evident that the representatives of the class of polyps do not stand upon the same structural level with one another ; but that there are higher and lower types among them, recognizable without the aid of embryological data, even though it· was the study of the young which led me to the recognition of their relative standing. This is not the place for a discussion of the principles of classification of polyps. I will only state, what I trust I shall be able to prove hereafter, that the Actinians proper stand ·lowest; next t-0 them the Madre~ porarians, and highest the Halcyonarians. And as the l\Iadreporarians form the most prominent feature in the coral reefs, I may add that among them the Turbinolians stand lowest, the Fungia.ns next, then the Astrmans, and highest the Madreporians. Now it is a most interesting fa.et that the snooessive changes which any repre»entative of these different groups exhibit during their

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

217

growth recall the characteristic features of the groups immediately below. For instance, young Astrreans, before assuming their solid frame, are Actinia-Iike; their first coral frame is Turbinolialike; and from that stage they pass into Fungia-like condition, before they assume their characteristic Astra:>an features. I will only describe a few C:Jses, in order to establish this correspondence of growth and relative standing of adults upon a firm scientific basis. Beside multiplying through eggs, Actinire increase also by budding, and this takes place by a spreading of their base of attachment, (abactinal area,) from the margin of which new individuals arise and finally detach themselyes. Such a mode of enlargement or spreading of a simple individual, by a widening of its base of attachment, I have observed in many genera among l<'ungians, Astrreans, Oculines, and 1\1adrepores. If we take, for instance, a Siderastra:a, which, by the way, is a Fnngian, and not an Astrrean, as is shown by the structure of its tentacles, as well as of its coral stock, we find that the large rounded ·masses formed by these corals are at first thiu, spreading disks, which onl,\· increase in thickness at a later time. The genus Myeedium, which, even in its perfect condition, constitutes a thin, spreading blade, may be compared, making allowance for the generic differences, to a young spreading stock of Siderastra:a. In 1\fycedimn the mode of growth ii yery plain. A series of specimens collected by 1\f. Pourtales shows the beginning of such a coral community to be a single individual, the margin of which gradually spreads; from this spreading edge are developed additional individuals in the trend of the radiating partitions of the parent indi\idual, spreading in their turn, while they remain connected with one another aml with the central individual; this process going on until the coral stock has assumed its ordinary dimensions. Let us now conceive that the indiYidnal polpys, united as a coral stock in Zllycedium, should increase vertically, as well as spread and multiply horizontally, the process of elevation beginning in the center we should have a Siderastrrea. It is worth noticing, further, that the original central indiddual, from which the Mycedium community arises, is a diminutiYe Fungia, upJo the time when new individuals arise around its margin. I have before me such young l\fycediums, which might be mistaken for small specimens of Fungia:, such as have been figured by Stuchbury and 1\lilne Ed wards. We are therefore justified in considering the genus FMngia as an embryonic form of the type of'Fungians, when we compare it to 1lfycediuin, Agaricia, or Siderastra:a ; and the propriety of assigning to Fnngia proper a lower position in a natural system than that belonging to the compound types of the family must be obvious to all. The genus Zoopilus is onl,y a l\Iycedium in which the individuals of the community are more intimately blended together than in Halomitra, thus forming a transition to Fnhgia proper. I have had an opportunity of examining also the growth of Agaricia. ·with the exception of generic difforences in its structure, it exhibits in its growth the same features as Mycediuru. The very ,\'Olrngest l\fycediums exhibit Tnrbinolian affinities, inasmuch as the interseptal chambers are open from top to bottom, and exhibit neither traverses nor synapticules. Among Astrffians the early growth of a community takes place in the same manner as among Fungians. Naturalists are accustomed to consider the formation of the hemispheric masses of these corals as arising from the formation of vertical buds around and between those which preceded. This mode of enlargement of the communities obtains really in later periods of their growth; but it is not in that way that the foundation of the community is laid. Astrma annularis, the most eommod species among the Ma<lreporarians of Florida, exhibits the formation of these stocks very plainly. The vast number of young stocks of this species which I have collected in every stage of growth leaves no doubt upon the subject. A simple individual polyp spreads by the elongation of its radiating partition, Mycedinm-like, in every direction, giving rise at appropriate distances to new centers or individuals around the first; and this goes on, without a marked vertical enlarge· ment of the new individuals, until the communit.y has acquired a diameter of several inches; just as in the cases of Mycedium, Agaricia, and Siderastrma. The appearance of this spreading margin of the young Astrwa stock is so like that of a spreading Fungian that, if detached from the well· defined circular individualB occupying the center of the disk, it would unhesitatingly be ta.ken for a fragment of a Fungian. It is only at a later time that in Astrwa annularilJ the members of the community are developed in a verti<Jal direction 7 and the community as a whole is enlarged by the interpolation of new individuals, to assume the form of a hemispheric mass. I have observed the same mode of growth in .Astraia caiiernosa, in Manicinia, in Sympkylli4, in Favia, in Oolpopkylli4a.nd

in Mmandrina. Of Manicina, I possess a series of young still exhibiting their Turbinolian charac· teristics, with intcrseptal chambers open from top to bottom, and without a trace of traverses. The corals with undulating and meandering trenches arise also, like compound Fungians and compound circular Astrmans, from single individuals, with circular outlines spreading from the margin, after the fashion of Fungians, just as much as .Astnca proper. 'l'he i1eculiarities exhibited by each type cannot well be described without figures; l shall therefore not attempt here a detailed report of all the facts I have observed, reser\'ing a fuller statement for a special memoir. Ent Mreandrfoa exhibits some features so particularly interesting that I cannot pass on without giving some more special account of them. Vvhen the young spreading 1\Imandrina has acquired the dimensions of about half an jnch, still })lainly exhibiting Fnngian characteristics, its marginal e~tension gives rise to the formation of isolated. clusters of rising radiating partitions, which stand distinct from one another, just like the characteristic hills of a Hydnophora; in fact, the young Mreandrina passes from a Fungian into an Ilyduopl10ra state, and in its farther extension, which takes place when the community has about two inches in diameter, when the trenches and walls begin to curve, while the margin hi still spreauiug horizontally, the young M:eandrina assumes the appearance of an Aspidiscus, a genus of the cretaceous period; in truth, it then resembles Aspidiscus and Hydnophora more than any adult representative of its own genus. We have here the highest complication of the Astr:eoiu type, exhiuiting successively :Fungfan characters, coIDmon Astrwa characters, Hyduophora characters, arnl Aspidiscus peculiarities, before it assumes its own prominent and permanent features. The Turbinolian stage I have had no opportunity of observing in Mreandrina. This genus seems to grow more rapidly than other Astrrnans, and it was with uiffi.culty I secured the earlier Astr::ean and Fnngian stages of its growth. Zoologists arc so accustomed to consider the OcuUn.idw and. .Madi·eporaidcc as branching corals, that they may be surprised at the annonncement that these families, like the Astrreans, have their spreading Fungian-like stage of growth ; and yet I have before me a complete series of Oculina stocks, among which small clusters of individuals in simple juxtaposition exhibit the earlist condition thus far o\1servetl; others consist of flat, spreauing disks, several inches in diameter, without a vertical branch; while· in others the branches seem to rise as small knobs and then begin to assume the ramified forms nuder which the Oculinas are generally represented in our museums. Even our most branching I\Iadrepores, such as lliadrepm·a prolifera and cervieornis, form spreading disks before tliey rise into branching stocks. llfadrepora palmata is, as it were, au overgrown embryonic condition of the ramified species. This summary of the facts concerning the growth of our coral stocks cau leave no doubt respeeting the corresponuence of the phases of growth of the polyps, and the gradation which may be recognizetl in full-grown communities of these animals. If we extend these comparisons to the representation of the class in earlier geological periods, down to the present time, we cannot fail· to perceive that the series exhibiting their succession in time coincides also with that of their relative standing and that of their growth. In order to make this plain, it would be necessary to enter jnto a discussion upon the real affinities of corals, for which this is not the place. I would state; however, that the knowledge I have acquired of the Fungian affinities of Biderastrrea leaves no <loubt in my mind that a large number of corals, among the representatives of the oolithic series generally referred to the family of .Astrreans, are genuine Fungians; thus showing a prepontlerance of the Fungiau type at a period anterior to that in-which the Astrreans became more numerous. Tbat the genuine Madreporians are of still later date in geological history has long been known. I would state also that from an examination of the soft parts of several representatives of the family of Eupsammidre, I have satisfied myself that they are riot allied to the true Madrepores, as ¥ilne Edwards and Haime supposed, but belong in the neighborhood of the Turbinolians. If we now remember that the Acalephian afiluities of the Tabulata are unquestionable, and that, with them, the Rugosa must be remo\'ed from the class of Polyps and referred to that of the Acalephs; and if we further take into consideration the fa.ct that Pal.wodiscus belongs to the type of Rugosa, and not to the family of Fungians, it becomes evident that in their order of succession from the Mesozoic era, in which they make their first appearance, the great types of the class of Polyps have succeeded one another in the following order : first Tnrbinolians, next 'Fnngians, next AstrreaD$1 and last Madrepores; in exactly the sequence· in which these types stand to one another, as far as their

structural gradation is concerned, and in exactly the same order in which, tluring- their growth, these corals pass from one stage to another. If we now turn our attention to the distribution of these animals iu tile ocean at different depths, it is equally unquestionable that the lowest types-Turbinolians and Eupsammidre-range in the greatest depths, antl form there the principal feature of the coral population. It is equally apparent, from the facts ascertained by the dredging;; of M. Pourtales, that the Yarious types of Astrreans, including Stylaster, Oculina, aml Parasmilia, appear next, the Stylasterians mid Oculinians, as the lowest, ranging deepest, and that Astnea proper, l\Ianicina, l\Ieamlrina, allll Colpoph,yllia, with Porites, are already types of shallower waters, while the :Madreporcs arc, of all the genuine corals, those which haYe the most limited bath;pnchic range. I have not yet sufficient data upon the relath'e standing of the different types of H(tlcyonaria to exteml this comparison to that order of Polyps. The results enumerated above are, however, alreau,r sufficient to 8how that, in the relations animals exhibit among thernselYes and to the elements in which they lin·, U1ere are other connections to be traced besides those arising from descent or the struggle for existence. I have reasons for supposing that tlie inwstigation of the Gulf Stream, as presentctl in former reports of the Coast Survey, has not yet rcnchcd its easternmost boundnry. It was uatuml that the earlier explorations should ha Ye stopped where the great current no longer exhibits its cltaracteristic peculiarities, and that its eastern range should have been traced with less minuteness than its alternate streaks of warm antl cold \Yater nrarer shore. But now that the influence of the Gulf Stream upon the geographical distribution of' organized lleings appears distinctly as one of its most characteristic, though lea;;;t sng1wcte\l features, it will be necessm·y to extend the sun-ey fartlter out into the Atlantic Ocean. :For the present I would suggest the follov1ing lines for soundings and drellgings: 1st. One line from the Atlantic coast in Georgia or South Carolina to deep water, outside the range of the Gulf Stream, chiefly with a Yiew of tracing the northern limits of the fauna of Florida. 2d. One line from the Atlantic coast in North Carolina or "Virginia to the Bermudas aml beyond; with the special view of connectilig the deep-water fauna of the Gulf Stream with the shore fauna of these islands and that of our own coast, upon which Cape Hatteras marks tlielimits between two natural zoological littoral proyinccs. 3d. One line from Cape Cod or from the coast of :llaiue, in a. sonthrast dirrction, across the Gulf Stream, with the special view of ascertaining the boundaries between the shore fauna and that of the Gulf Stream at this latitude. This line woultl afford the means of e:x.tensiYc oomparisons with our Acadian fauna, which has already lleen carefully explored as far as Grand Mauan, by Dr. Stimpson, Professor Verrill, and myself. Shorter lines. from Sanely Hook to the trough of the Gulf Stream would add much ;-alue to the results obtaine(l hy dredgings from the coast of l\Iassachusetts or Maine across the Gulf Stream. I would also recommend one line across the Caribbean Sea, from Cnrnana or La Guayra to Porto Rico, and one outside of the Small Antilles from the mouth of the Orinoco to Antigua ; with the . .special >iew ofascectainiug the area over which the mud deposits of the Orinoco spread, aud how far they affect the Caribbean Sea. But the most important line beyond our immediate shores, connected with the past history of the Gulf Stream, woulcl be one from Panama westward into the deepest waters of the Pacific; for . dredgings in that direction may proYe that the deep-sea fauna is identical on both sides of the Isthmus, and that therefore, at a comparatfrely recent epoch, the great equatorial current of the Atlantic· extended without serious obstructions oyer parts of Central America to the Pacific Ocean.

APPENDIX No. 11.
THE GULF STREAM.-CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ATLANTIC SEA-BOTTOM OFF THE COAST OF THE UNITED STATES, BY L. F. POURTALES, ASSISTANT UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

Within the past few years a great interest has been manifested in the exploration of the bottom of the sea at great depths, and a rich and important field of scientific inquiry has thus been opened. Previously, it is true, naturalists had engaged in dredging, but it was mostly in moderate depths, and not far from shore. The restricting reasons were partly the expense, too considerable for private undertakings, and partly the authority of a naturalist, who, although an acute observer, was misled by fortuitous circumstances to regard the abyssal region as unfit for animal life. It was · only long after his death that the error was recognized. An opposite view has been confirmed by the discoveries of the Coast Survey, and by the soundings preparatory to laying the Atlantic submarine telegraph-cable. Then only it became apparent how important for science the thorough exploration of this new field of research would become .. Of European nations England, Norway, and Sweden have particularly distinguished themseh-es in this field. In the present year England and Sweden have sent out expeditions for deep· sea dredging, and it is known that important results will in G.ue time he published. It is fit, therefore, t-0 review at the present time the share which the Coast Survey has taken in such investigations, and also to take a general view of the formation of the sea-bottom along the coast of the United States as developed in our researches. When Professor Bache first entered on his duties as Superintendent in 1844, he directed tho preservation of the specimens of bottom brought up by the leatl in hydrographic surveys. The object was twofold: first, to make certain the character of the bottom as it is usually marked on the charts, and secondly, to collect specimens for scientific investigation, at that time probably the first collection of the kind. The ordinary hydrographic surveys extentl only to Ute hundred fathoms line, but during the explorations of the Gulf Stream, under the direction of Professor Bache, specimens were obtained from much greater depths and in considerable quantities. No o:lf-shure explorations were prosecuted during the rebellion, but in the last three years a special exploration by means of the dredge bas been continued in charge of Assistant Pourtales. The results from the beginning will now be recapitulated briefly in their order. At first specimens of bottom were obtained in the usual way of seamen, by arming the lead with tallow; but as the quantity of material brought up in this way was very small, and almost useless for microscopical observation, except after a tedious removal of the tallow by chemical agents, it became necessary to devise better means. Each of the Navy officers engaged in this special hydrography occupied himself for a time with such invent.ions, and used his favorite model. The most useful, perhaps, were the sounding-cups of Lieutenants Stellwagen and Sands. The first being simple, convenient, and cheap in construction, has probably been the most in use, particularly in shoaler waters. It consists of a small cast-iron conical cup, serewed on a rod projecting from the lower end of the lead. A loose leathern cover, kept down by the pressure of the water when the lead is hauled up, prevents the material from being washed out of the cup. In the in'\"ention of Lieutenant (now Oommodore) Sands, a.lateral opening into the conical projection of the lead is exposed by pressure against a spring when the cone penetrate!! the bottom, which spring again covers the opening when the lead is drawn eut. C<?mbined with the detaching-lead invented by the sa.me oftl.cer, this contrive.nee has proved very useful in great depths. It has the advantage over the well-known Brooke's lead of bringing up larger quantities of material.

Collected hy such means, the specimens are presen·ed in small bottles properly labeled with the indication of date, latitude, longitude, and depth. The number of specimens in the Coast Survey collection amounts now to about nine thousand. The first microscopical examination of the specimens was made b.Y the late Professor J. W. Bailey, of ·west Point, who first called attention to their richness in Foraminifcra. Later, and particularly after Professor Bailey's death, the continuation of the investigation was intrusted to 1\Ir. Ponrtales, but as he could devote to it but part of his time, being engaged iu other duties, the work is yet in progress. It is, however, possible, even now, to throw such a general glance over the constitution of the sea-bottom along a large portion of the Atlantic coast as will properlJ· intro. duce the more special consideration of tlie results of tlie recent dredging explorations. On the accompanying map the chief constituents of the sea-bottom are indicated by colors for the region comprised between Cape Cod and Cuba. To the north of Cape Cod the bottom differs considerably, and is broken by frequent masses of rock. The examination of it is not complete enough to be taken into consideration now. As shown by the map, two main diYisions strike the eye immediately: they are the siliciou.~ aml the calcareous Lottom, the first prevailing near the coast as far south as Cape I 'lorida; the calcerous, with two important subdivisions, in greater depths, and along the southern extremity of Florida, the Bahamas, and part of the coast of Cuba. It is remarkable at the first glance, how closely the limits of the silicious bottom coincide with tlle limits of the cold southerly current and the limits of the calcareous with the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. On the other lrnm1, thm;e limits coincide also at the north perhaps more closely with the hum1n·1l-fathoms cmTe. It appears more plausible to attribute the distrilmtion of organic life to which the bottom owes its supJJl,\· of lime t.o increase of depth, rather than t-0 difference of temperature, the more so as there is no correspondence between the temperature at the bottom and at the surface of the water. 'Ve shall recur to this Yiew presently. A smaller field is occupied by muddy bottom off tlie eastern ernl of J,ong Island, and off Block Island to the southward of Martha's Vine.Yard and Nantucket. The mud or ooze had probably its origin in the tertiary formations, of which we sec only the remnants in the cliffs of Gay Ileacl and in a few localities of small extent on the coast of ?.lassachusetts, as at 1\Iarshfield and elsewhere. Known to seamen under the name of the "Block Island soundings," this sea-bott-0m is, in thick weather, a yery useful indication to them of the approach of land. A similar sea-bottom is found in the so-called "mud-holes" off the m1trauce to New York. They are depressions helow the general depth of the surrounding bottom, filled with mud, and range iu the direction of the entrance to the bay. Professor Dana considers them as traces of the ancient bed of the Hudson, at a for. mer geological period, when this bottom stood above the bottom of the existing sea. The "mudholes" are also important guides to navigation. SUicious bottom.-We have chosen for a nearer eluehlatiou of tl1 is formation the region in the neighborhood of New York, and off the coasts of I.ong Island and New Jersey, because almnuant materials were collected at an early period, and cxaminca by Professor Bailey and Assistant Pourtales: With few exceptions, the same order of arrangement preyails on other parts of the coast. The bottom falls off very gradually to near the hundred-fathoms line, in the neighborhood of which the water deepens rapidly. The same slope to seaward is common, and may be seen, for example, on the fine chart of tlte sea-bottom near the coast of France, by Delesse. It is therefore with very good reason that the one hundred-futhoms line is indicated on the best geographical maps, for it marks the real cont~ur of the continents. The sand of the American coast is composed chiefly of a yellowish quartz, (in the Gulf of Mexico often pure white,) with more or less black specks of hornblemle and a little felspar. The degree of coarseness is very variable, ranging from au almost impalpable grain to the size of peas or beans. These differences are probably due to the winnowing effect of currents, and in smaller depths to the waves. Among the coarser materials, rolled pebbles can occasionally (though not often) be recognized as belonging to some of the older. sedimentary rocks, which appear nowhere along the coast in this vicinity, and fragments of which have probably been brought down the rivers by ice, from. the localities on their upper courses where these rocks are found in place. Off Long Branch and off Rockaway beach, near the entrance to New York Bay, the sand contains a large mixture of black grains. They are greensand-grains or glauconite, casts of the shells

of Foraniinifera from the greensand formation of New Jersey, and have been washed out either from the shore or from an outcropping of the beds under the sea-level. The examination of the organic constituents of the sea-bottom was, of necessity, a microscopical one, because of the manner in which the specimens were obtained. It is t.rue that now and then small shells and Echinoderms, or fragments of larger ·ones, were brought up by the lead, but in the aggregate not eJ10ugh to give indications of their distribution. It was principally to the Forarninifera that our attention has been given, because these beings are large enough to be recognized with the ordinary lens, and because, at the outset, the examination sought to point the rnn-igator to characteristics, additional to those of color and quality, in his soundings. In correspondence with the accompanying map, certain regions off the Atlantic coast are characterized by the prtwalence of certain forms of Foraminifera. The first region, counting from the coast-line, is characterized by a great poverty of forms. Excepting a few very small Polystomellle, we find nothing in the sand, which is here kept in continual motion by tlle waves. This region we may consider to extend to a depth of ten or twelve fathoms. Ful'tber seaward we find different species of Miliolina:, but never in large numbers. ·we find them to about fopty fathoms, and also beyond, as it were sporadically. From twenty-fiye to seventy fathoms Trmwatulina advena d'Orb, is the characteristic form, and occurs occasionally in considerable numbers. The next region of the larger Marginul-inre and Oristellaricc encroaches on the former from about thirty-five fathoms, and extends as far as one hundred fathoms and be,yond. From about sixty fathoms the santl begins to be mingled strongly with Gl-Obigerince, whose numbers increase so much with depth, that at one hundred fathoms they are about equal in number with the grains of sand, and in greater depths they become the chief constituents of the sea-bottom, and lead us to the calcareous formation, in the consideration of which we shall mention them again. In the mud of the "Block Island soundings," and of the" mud-holes,'~ we find of organic forms very little else than Gi1tt1tlincc, and those, even, are rather scarce. The same dhitribution prevails all the way to Cape Florida, with few exceptions. Interruptions are rare in this great sandy plain. Thus we find only one or two small rocky patches in the Jleighborhood of the entrance to X ew York Bay. There are also, off the coasts of North and South Carolina, rocky banks of small extent, not much raised above the general level of the sea-bottom. These consist of a calcareous material, and are probably the continuation of the tertiary beds found in the land along those shores. They are inhabited by corals, (oculina,) gorgonians, and various other animals, and are much richer in fishes than the sandy bottom, whence they are generally called fl~Mng-banks by the inhabitants. Several such are found off Cape Fear, and, to judge from the nature of the corals and shells thrown up on the beaches near Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout, similar banks, but of small extent, probably exist in the vicinity. The sandy bottom ends exactly at Cape Florida. Key Biscayne, of which the southern point is Cape Florida, consists in great part of silicious sand. The next island, to the southward, only five miles distant, shows no trace of sand, but consists exclusively of coral limestone, of which also is formed the whole range of the Florida Keys, with the exception of the Pine Keys, standing somewhat back from the range. These, according to Professor Agassiz, contain silicious sand, for which ri.~ason they are the only ones that support the growth of pine trees-whence their name. About Cape Sable silicious sand re-appears, and extends along the western coast of Florida, though at first strongly mixed with lime. It is remarkable how the littoral fauna changes with the constitution of the bottom. Many forms of animals'peculiar to the Carolinian fauna disappear at Cape Florida and re-appear at Cape Sable and on the west coast of the peninsula. Between these points they are entirely crowded out by the interposition of the West Indian fauna of the coral reefs. To take but one example, oysters are not found on the coral bottom, though abundant to the east and west on the sandy bottom. Calcareous bottom.-The calcareous bottom, indicated on the map by a blue tint, is, as is well known, entirely of organic origin. According to t\e classes of organized beings whieh have contributed the greatest part, we can subdivide this formation into coral and foraminiferons formll· tions, which _will be fo~nd distinguished on the map by lighter and darker tintei

Coral formation.-It is generally known that corals are de>eloped so extensiwly as to contribute to the formation of the bottom or of the adjoining land, but only in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Their northernmost limit on the coast of the United States is, as we baYe stated, Cape Florida. Of the littoral corals, and the reef's whfch they build upon the coast of Florida, it is not our o"Qject to treat in this paper. Professor Agassiz has fully discussed that sul~jeet, but bis researches ham not been fully published. Outside of the reef, and in greater depths, this formation was little known, until, a8 before mentioned, a thorough examination of the bottom by means of the dredge was instituted. Assistant Ilenry Mitchell conducted the physical exploration of the Gulf Stream, and Assistant Ponrtales the dredging operations. The Coast Survey 'steamer Bibb, iu charge of Acting Master Platt1 was designated for the service, and was supplied 1'ith the necessary apparatus, among which was the steam-reel, an almost indispensable help to bring up the deep-sea lead and the dredge from great depths without loss of time. The Museum of Coruparath e Zoology, in Cam bridge, furnished the necessary means for in'cscrYing the collection. · In the year 1867 a beginning W"as made, in connectiou with the souudings preliminary to laying the telegraph-cable between Key \Vest and lla>ana. In lSGS and 1869 the researches were continued, in the present year under the eye of Professor Agassiz, 1\ho spent a considerable part of the season on board of the steamer. · On tbe maps are indicated the lines of d1·edgfogs and the dredging-stations, without, howeYcr, indications of the depth, on account of the small scale. 'fhc sections gi,·en on tlie sketch iH part sq,pply that want. The results are, in the main, the following: The coral reef proper is pretty sharply limited, because of the well-known fact that the large reef-building corals flourish only near the surface. Outside of it the slope is not Yery steep, and not to lie compared in this respect with the abrupt preci1lices out of which rise the coral islands of the Pacific Ocean, or even the reefs of tbe Bahamas. From the reef down to a depth of about ninety or one hundred fathoms, the sea-bottom consists principally of dead shells, fragments of corals and similar materials, more or less broken or rolled. Of living animals or plants there are not a great many, among the corals only a few ~mall Rpecies, (Balanophyllia, Madracis, Oculina.) On leaving this first region we find a rocky plateau, with Yery moderate slope, bcgiuuiug a little to the westward of Sand Key and extending to the northward and eastward until it reaches its greatest breadth, of about eighteen nautical miles, a little to the eastward of Sombrero. It then begins to diminish in breadth, and finally ends between Carysfort lteef and Cape Florida, at the same time approaching the reef. Tlie de11th on this lllateau extends from about ninety fathoms to about two hundred and fifty to three hundred. The rock of which it consists is a dark-brown, hard limestone, in which the comls and ~hells liYing on its surface, and to which it owes its formation, can frequently be recognized. · The fauna of this bottom is much richer than that of the first region. All the classes of the sea-in>ertebrates are fully represented: Crustacea., mollusks, (among which the most abundant are two species of Brachiopods1 and the rare roiuta Junonia is not unfrequently obtained here liYing,) Echinoderms, particularly Echinid<JJ and Ophuriilw j also Astrreidro and Holothuridlr, but Jess abundantly; then quite a number of Sfllall corals and Gorgonid<£, mostly of >ery elegant form; finally, sponges and Foraminifera. Of truly wgetable forms we find only a few Nullipores and Diatoms, but no true Algre. A similar sea-bottom, but with a very steep slope, is formed on the north side of Uulm, to a depth of three hundred to four hundred fathoms, also inhabited by a rich fauna, which presents, however, considerable differences from the one just mentioned, notwithstanding the short distance between the two coasts. Near the Bahama Banks, which our explorations have touched in but yery few imints, we found the steep slope covered with calcareous sand. Foraminiferous calcareQtf8 bottom.-In great depths, as, for instance, in the straits of Florida, at the outward limit of the rocky bottom, and, where this does not exist, even in less depths, the botton: is covered by a chalk-like layer,which resolves itself, under the microscope, into a mass of

224

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Foram,inifera and their fragments, more or less comminuted. This formation extends almost uninterruptedly in the whole bed of the Gulf Stream, in the greater depths of the Gulf of Mexico, in the deep channels which intersect the Bahama Banks, and then up the Atlantic coast from about the hundred-fathom curve outward, or from the inner ]jmit of the Gulf Stream, which nearly coincides with it, and so oYer the greater part of t,hc Atlantic basin. The discoyery of this formation belongs to the year 1853, when it was founu almost 1>imultaneously by Lieutenants Craven and Maffitt, then in the Coast Sun-ey, and exploring the Gulf Stream. It became more extensi\ely known, somewhat later, by the soundings made for the Atlantic telegTaph. The genus of Foraminifera most abundantly represented in this bottom is the Globigerina; hence the term '' Globigcrina bottom" is becoming generally used. Then comes in order of frequency Rotn.lina cultrata; then several Textularicc, Marginulincc, &c. It is now pretty generally admitted that these Rhizopods live and die in these great depths, although formerly false ideas of the effects of pressure, of the want of light, &c., seemed to militate against the suppositiou. But that animals living near the surface contribute al8o. a not inconsiderable proportion, is proYed by th~ numerous shells ol' Pteropods, occasional teeth of fishes, &c. Of higher animals the lead has frequently brought some fragmeuts. In one case ]\fr. Pourtales brought up a specimen of not quite two cubic inches from a depth of five hundred and ten fathoms, and found in it distinct fragments of at least forty-eight different species, among which were twenty mollusks. Since we haYe used the dredge they have also been observed living. Small unattached corals, delicate Alcyonians, Ophiurians, Annelids, Mollusks, and Crustacea are commonly found in the dredge; yery rarely a small fish. 'Ve obtained not nnfrequently the curious living Crinoid, Rhizocrinus lufotensis of Sars, found !Jy him off the coast of Norway, obtained also recently \Jy Carpenter and Thomson in the vicinity of the British Islands, and this summer by Smitt and Ljungmans, on the newly discovered Josephine Bank, not far from the Azores. These four localities are within the limits of the Gulf Stream and of its branches, This whole bed is an immense layer of chalk, to which the organic life de>cloped on its surface is constant1y adding, while nearer shore the faume of the littoral and deep-sea regions, with their numerous corals and shells, contribute to the formation of limestone of various characters, such as Oolite, l\Inschelkalk, Coral Hag, and conglomerates from beds broken np and reconstructed. \Ve must mention one formation, the origin of which, in former geological periods, was uue to Foraminijera, aud which is at the prrRent day in in·ocei;;s of formation in certain parts of the sea· bottom. · Gfeensandformation.-Ehrcnberg made, as is well known, the interesting discovery that the so-called grecnsand or glauconite consists of the casts of Foraminifcra. That this process is still going on at the bottom of the ocean, near our coasts, was discovered by Bailey, from the examination of our specimens of bottom. In ~;oine of them the whole process can be followed in the most interesting way. Thus we find, side by side, the tests perfectly fresh, others still entire, but filled with a rusty-colored mass, which permeates the finest canals of the shells like an injection. In others, again, the shell is partly broken away, and the filling is turning greenish; and finally we find the casts without trace of shell, sometimes perfectly reproducing the internal form of the chambers; sometimes, particularly in the larger ones, cracks of the surface or conglomeration with other grains obliterates all the characters. They eYen cotilesee into pebbles, in which the casts can only be recognized after grinding and polishing. Mr. Pourtales has succeeded, by the examination of many specimens, in indicating on the map a region in which this formation is particularly developed. It is situated off the coasts of Georgia and South Oarolina, in fifty t-0 one hundred fathoms, pretty mnch on the border between the silicious and the foraminiferous s'ea-bottoms. Now and then the greensand occurs also in greater depths untler the Gulf Stream, but apparently without regularity. Why this process of transfor· mation should occur only in particular localities is as yet unexplained. It is easy to distinguish this fresh-formed greensand from the tertiary one off the coast of New Jersey, by the greater number of perfect tests of Foraminifera mixed with it. Our researehelil have extended to about seven }\undred fathoms; much greater depths do not occur in the field examined. Life was found as deep as we went; not abnndantly1 to be snre, but we have reason to believe that the constitution of the bottom, more than the actual d.eptb, is the

cause of the diminution ; for the change occurred rnry abruptly in passing from the rocky to the foraminiferous· bottom. With regard to the physical conditions under which these animals live, it is well known that the temperature in great depths is very low, not many degrees above the freezing-point. A certain degree of light probably penetrates. Thtl Urustacea, Annelids, and mollusks found there have well-developed eyes, if anything, larger than those of their congeners of the littoral zone. The results of the expeditions of 1867-'68 have been partly worked up and published in the "Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge." The collections made this year and the still undetermined parts of those of former years are in band for description. The Echinoderms have been reported on by Alexander Agassiz, Theodore Lyman, and Assistant Pourtales, and· a comprehensive report of great interest has been made by Professor Agassiz. (Appendix No.10.) One of the most important results, so far, is the fact that the Corals and Echinoderms of the deep-sea region bear a type having many points of resemblance with the tertiary and cretaceous fannre. Furthermore, that many forms have a very extended geographical distribution, as we have seen above in the case of Rhizocrinus. How this distribution has taken place we shall not be able to know until we understand better the currents of the ocean, particularly in the depth. The impulse given to deep-sea investigation is a vigorous one, and has received a hearty support from several governments. Thus, in the last two years, Carpenter, Thomson, and Jeffreys, in the Lightning and Porcupine, have explored the sea-bottom along the coast of Europe, from the Faroe Islands to Cape Finisterre, and have sunk their dredge to the great depth of 2,500 fathoms. Smitt and Ljungmans, in the Swedish frigate Josephine, dredged from the coast of Portugal to the Azores, and thus across the Atlantic Ocean to America; ·and a Norwegian frigate is about to visit the coast of Brazil for similar purposes. Let us hope tl~at ·other governments will follow, and employ some of the ships of their navies in these interesting developments.

REPORT Of THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 12.
ON THE USE OF THE ZENITH-TELESCOPE FOR OBSERVATIONS OF TIME, BY J, E. HILGARD.

The zenith-telescope, or equal-altitude iustrument, has now, during twenty years, been ·used very successfully for determinations of la ti tu de, and, with Americans, has become the favorite fteldinstrument, both on account of the precision of its results and of the facility of observation. Its power for the determination of time has not, however, been developed, although well adapted for the purpose. Gauss, indeed, has shown, long since, how observations of stars on the same hori· zontal circle, or at equal altitudes in dilferent wrticals, would yield the co-ordinates of time and latitude, and has solved the problem in its most general form. But the want of a sufficient number of well-determined stars prevented him from developing the most advantageous special cases of the method, requiring the minimum of' computa.tion, viz, the determination of' latitude by equal altitudes on the meridian, north and south of the zenith, and that of time by equal altitudes on the prime vertical, east and west of the renith. When we consider the great ]H'ecision with whieb the zenith-telescope enables us to observe eq11al altitudes, we will perceive at once itiapplicability to that purpose. Here, as in the observa· tions for latitude, we require a 1iumber of' well-determined stars grouped according to certain conditions. The abundance of such positions that is afforded by recent catalogues ~f stars renders of easy application methods which would formerly have failed for want of such data, and which, for that reason, were not developed. If' two stars of precisely the same polar distance, but differing 11ome hours in right ascension, had been observed at the same zenith dh;tance, on opposite sides of the meridian, one to the east, the other to the west, it is obvious that the mean of their right ascensions would express the right ascension of the zenith, or the sidereal time corres110mliug to the mean of the observed times. Further, if there were but a small dUference in poll;l.r distance, the corresponding change in the hour-angle, or correction to the time, could be expressed by a simple differential formula. Since the determination of time by means of zenith distance is most advantageous when the star is on the prime vertical, we will first consider the proposed method under that condition, which, moreover, affords the practical convenience that an opening along the east and west line of the observatory, if the instrument is housed, will afford the command of all the stars that may be selected. In the temporary observatories used in the Coast Survey, the ridge of the roof runs east and west, and it is very easy so to construct it, with a double ridge-beam, as to have an opening of six inches which will be covered by a folding door. · We propose, then, to select a pair of' stars so conditioned that they will 1>ass the prime vertical at nearly equal zenith distances on opposite sides of the meridian, at no great interval of time from each other. This requires that their polar distance should be nearly equal; moreover, the stars must be south of the zenith in order that they may pass the prime vertical at all, and yet sufficiently far north of the equator in order that they may cross the prime vert.ical at an altitude beyond the influence of irregular refraction. This somewhat limits our selection. Before defining the limits more prAcisely, we wilJ now consider the formulffi required for computation. We require to know approximately the hour-angle, H, and the zenith distance, c, for the purpose of making the selection and preparing for the observations. We have given the co-latitude, i., the polar distance, .d, and the right angle at the zenith. We have for the boar-angleeos H = cot .d tan ;,. For the zenith distance-

cos c = oos .d see J.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

227

We further requii:e differential expressions for the variations in the hour-angle arisiug from a change in polar distance, and from that change in zenith distance which is expressed by the level correction. As the zenith distance gives the most convenient expressions, and is also required for setting the instrument, we employ it for that purpose, and obtain rea<lilytan l <l H = d J sin A sin ~ cos I'

dH=d~ cosJt~ni.

As we ham in the first expression the sine of the zenith distance as a diYisor, we are warned not to come too near the zenith in this .method of obsening for time, lest the error in the difference of polar distance be greatly exaggerated in the correction of the time. Assuming the uncertainty of that difference at one second of arc, we must not allow the numerical >alue of the factor sm ~'t:i~; to exceed three, if we would not admit an unc'3rtainty greater than two-tenths of a 8econd of time. Hence we should not choose stars that cross the prime vertical nearer to the zenith than about 300. The problem would take a more favorable form in tllis respect if we could observe the stars precisely on the prime vertical, and measure with the micrometer the difference of zenith distance due to tbat of polar distance. But, as we ban no meaus of fixing the instrument iu that yertical, it is best to -accept the simpler mode of using equal altitudes. We shall, however, hereafter cousider more fully the mode of observing just mentionerl. Let us now illustrate the proposed method by an e~mplc. \Yishiug to make obscrrntioas for time in that way at Washington, in October, 18G!J, we proceed as follows: Taking the latitude at 38° 53' JO", aud adopting 75° as the greatest polar distance to \Je used, in order not to approach too near t.he horizon, we prcvare for the selcctiou of stars by computiug a table of zenith distances and hour-angles, as girnn below. This may he done h~· computing for every second degree and interpolating the intermediate values. This is the. only imrt of the opera· tion that may appear laborious to observers, but, as the factors tan i. and sec i. are con:stant, the computation can be wade vcr·y readil,v. Arresting the computation "·hen a zl·nith di~tance of 300 is about reached, we form the following table: Zenith di.,lrwi·e wul lw11r-a11gle of stars 011 the yri.mc talical of Wwslti11gtn11, :ltF r.:1· w·.

Arranging the signs for the form E - W, we obscrrn that the star haYing the greater polar distance has also the greater hour-angle, and that if the eastern star have the greater pola1· distance, making E - W positive, it will cross the prime vertical earlier. Therefore, in order to make the observation what it would have been if both stars had the same polar distance, we must add the correction for difference of polar distance. d .:I tan tl 8 d H = 15 sin .:I sin t: = 18 .Ol to the sum of the observed times, or half of it to their mean, with the sign resulting from taking the polar distance of the western from that of the eastern stars. Again, as to the level.correction, if the east end is t-00 high, the zenith of the instrument is to the west of the true zenith, and the obser\1 ation will be too late by a corresponding amount. The Ievel-con'OOtion must therefore be applied with the sign resulting from subtracting the ea.st read· ings from the west readings. The scale being numbered each way from the middle, we must take one-fourth the dift'erenceof the sums, and find the level-correction to be -1", which, multiplied with

The restriction to observation of equal altitudes near the prime vertical was adoptetl at the outset; from considerations of the more ready computation of the hour-angle and zenith distance in the right-angled triangle, and of the convenience of having a continuous opening in the :field observatory, along the ridge of the building. Moreover, tbe determination of time by equal altitudes is most exact when maue in the prime vertical. It may, nevertheless, prove expedient to choose pairs of stars not so situated, especially such as can be found in the astronomical ephemeris, with the apparent places ready to hand. Of such pairs a larger number than might be anticipated may be found, ha,ing nearly equal polar distances, and sufficiently far apart in right ascension -to yield a goou determination of time.

If we are observing in the open air, a selection from these pairs will be found the most convenient, requiring very little preparation. In a temporary observatory it may be found best to make small openings, with covers, for the stars that are selected to serve for tbe determination of time on a series of nights.

· The simplest and most direct mode of determining the time for equal altitudes is that of ob· serving the same star on or near the prime vertical on both sill.es of the zenith. In order that the obserr-ations may be confined ·within convenient limits of time, the star should have a small zenith distance, or its decijnation must be nearly equal to the latitude of the station. The limit of zenith distance corresponding to any assumed liwit of interval between the eastern and western observations can be readily computed, but it will practically suffice to say for our latitudes that the zenith distance should not exceed one degree. That the star should pass to the south of the zenith is most advantageous, but even if it passes to the north within that limit, the observation will be quite satisfactory, although, of course, it cannot be made on the prime vertical. The preparation for the work will be the same as already set forth, and as the obserr-ations are presumed to be made at precisely equal altitudes, the mean of the observed times, corrected for level-error, will correspond to the right ascension of the star. It is worthy of note that both time and latitude may be determined with the zenith-telescope

by observations upon one star passing within a few minutes of the zenit4, in the following elegant manne1·: The instrument being set to the zenith, turn it in azimuth to the east, and note the passage of the star over a wire rather low in the field; next, turn to the south, point the micrometer on it about 208 before the meridian passage, read, turn the instrument to the north and again bisect the star about 20 8 after meridian passage, and finally note the passage over the same wire, as before, as the star descends to the we~t. The mean of the east and west observations will give the time of the star's meridian passage, while the difference of the north and south observations will give the zenith distance on the meridian in terms of the micrometer. The level may be read in the several positions before or after the observations on the star. We have referred to the plan of making the observations for time by measuring the difference of zenith distance in the prime vertical with the micrometer, when using two stars of unequal declination. The general scheme would be to correct the difference of time by means of the measured difference of zenith distance, and thus reduce the observation to the case of equal altitudes of stars having the same declination. But the details of the observation, as well as of the reduction, would be much more complicated than in the cases that we have developed, and since no lack of stars, suitable for those methods, is to be apprehended, it would not be useful to explain more fully the . plan last mentioned. The foregoing method has been sketched chiefly with the view of setting forth that the transportatiqn and mounting of a transit-instrument may be dispensed with, when the determination of time is only required for the purpose of reducing latitude observations made with the zenith-telescope, and those of the azimuth of geodesic lines which are usually combined with the former. When the latter only are required, the theodolite itself will serve conveniently for the determination of time, used either as a transit or for equal altitudes in the manner above described.

The sheets of the self-registering tide-gauges of the CoaRt Snrvry at San Diego, Fort Point (San Francisco), all(l Astoria (month of the Columbia Hiver), show, on tile 18th of August, 18()8, the most considerable earthquake fluctuations which have twer Leen registere11 in that way. These were due to the great earthquake of A.ugust 13, the shocks of which were uearl,y vertical at Arica, Peru. At Arica the officers of the United States steamer \Vateree report that the first shock began at 5i. 05m and lasted till 5 11 15m; and that the first wave in the harbor began at 5h 32m, At San Diego the fluctuations began on the 14tll at zi. a. m. and reached a maximum of amplitude at Sh 40m p. m., and disappeared about the 20tll at 6h· a. m. Tile greatest amplitude was 2.6 feet, and the period about 30 to 40 minutes. At Fort Point the fluctuations began on the 14th at 3 11 a. m., reaclied a maximum (which has some appearance of correspondence with that at San Diego) at 211 JOm p. m., and disappeared about noon on the 19th. 1'he maximum amplitude was 1.8 feet. At Astoria the fluctuations began on the 14th at 8h JOm a. m. The maximum was reached at Sh 40m p. m., and the irregularities disappeared about midnight on tlie 17th. The maximum was 1.1 feet. The following letter has been received by the Superintendent of the Surn1y, showing the time and amplitude of the waves at Kodiak Island, Alaska :
" SAINT P APL, KODIAX, "Alaska Territory, October 18, 1868. "DEAR Sm: Supposing that it would be of interest to you, I have t.lie honor of reporting the occurrence, at this place, of an extraordinary ocean-wave, which took place between 10 o'clock a. m. and 2 p. m. ou the 14th of August last. "I was not here myself to witness it, and there was no special or accurate observation maue of it; but from those who did witness it I learn that at the time of the first waH\ the tilte was abont one-third ebb-the tide here rises about ten feet-and in about half an hour it rose to about four feet above ordinary high water. It then receded, and afterward, at intervals of about an hour ea-0h, it would come and go, each time giving less and less. "I observe by the papers that this was on the day succeeding the great earthquake ip Peru, and no doubt this wave was caused by it, and, being_ so marked at this distant point, it will no doubt prove an interesting fact to you. "I will make further inquiries, when I have an opportunity of so doing, whether any wave waa observed at Ounalaska, Saint Paul, or any other islands westward of thi:s.

REPORTS CONCERNING MARTHA'S VINEY.ARD .AND NANTUCKET.
REPORT OF PROFESSOR HENRY L. WHITING ON EDGARTOWN HARBOR.

January 2, 1872. DEAR Sm: In compliance with your instructions of 18th July last, I proceeded to_E1lgartown, Martha?s Vineyard, to make a survey of the changes in the topography of the harbor for the purpose of compariug the results with those of my former surveys of this locality, and in connection with the pl1ysical surye;_r8 of Professor .Mitchell, to ascertain, if possible, the effect of these changes upon the harbor. The comparison of the surrnys just made with those of previous dates-1846, 1854, 18551 and 1856-giving intervals of fifteen and twenty-five years, affords data for most interesting study, and gives au accurate exhibit of the actiou of waves aud currents along this section of the coast. In his former awl late reports, Professor Mitchell has stated the peculiar physical relation of the tides of the Vineyard and Nantucket Sounds to those coming upon the south shores of the islands of l\Iartha?s Vineyanl and Nantucket, and the circulation of currents through Edgartown Harbor, and the former opening in Cotamy Beach. I will not, therefore, dfocuss these subjects in my report, but merel~, girn their effects as they appear. .At the time of my first survey, in 1846, the opening through Cotamy Beach was at the eastern corner, so to speak, of the bay, but 11ot beyond the southwestern point of Chappaquiddick Island; in fact, the inlet was formed by this point of Chappaquiddick ancl the east end of the beach, and was about two thousand feet in width. Within the opening, however, were two small sand islands, with channel-ways between and on either side of them. This condition of the inlet corresponded in its general location and width to that shown on the maps of Des Earres of 1776. In 1856 I was ordered by Professor Bache to m.ake a resurvey and examination of this same locality, in order to determine the position and dimensions of the new opening which was reported· to have been made by a then recent storm. By this survey I found great changes had taken place since 1846. The old inlet had worked about one mile to the eastward of its former site, and the point of the beach had lapped by the end of Chappaquiddick over half a mile. The shore of this island, along its southwestern face, had washed away to the extent of about 2,300 superficial feet. This action had changed the character and capacity of the inlet from a broad opening, of 2,000 feet, directly opposite the waters of the bay, \o a much narrower channel confined between the fast land of Chappaquiddick and the beach. This water-way between the ocean and.the bay was about 3,000 feet in length and about 500 feet in width. The new inlet had broken open about opposite the middle of the bay, and was, at the time of my survey-1856-about 1,400 feet in width, thus restoring the total inlet capacity, so far as width was concerned, to nearly that of the old inlet of 1846. Since 1856 we have had no determination of the beach until the surveys made last summer, when it was found to extend across the ent-ire south part of the bay, with no opening into the ocean. We have, however, quite reliable local information concerning the intermediate changes, from which we have obtained the foJlowing general facts: SQon after the "west opening," so called, of 1856, was formed, the "east opening" closed, and the new west opening, following the law of motion wltich seems to govern all the infots on the south side of the island, began its mevement eastward, and continued until it reached the site of

the former inlet of Des Barres, and of the Coast Survey of 1846, passed on to the site of the inlet of 1856, and st.ill continued working eastward until the point of beach forming its outer chop reached a point in line with the general trend of the east shore of' Chappaquiddick. Ilere the rapid tidal currents of Muskeget Channel checked its further progress. For a time tlle tidal currents into and out from Cotamy B!Ly battled with the sea-dash upon the shore, the lat.ter gradually gaining ground upon the current power, crowding the beach further and further toward the main laud of Chappaquiddick and narrowing the water-way between them, until, at the occurrence of a storm and tide favoring the action, the most easterly portion of the beach was beaten in upon the island by the ocean waves and the inlet closed. This ha.ppeued in 1869, sinct1 whicl1 time the bmwh has remained intact, and all the tidal action and infiuenee of a southern inlet, connecting the waters of the ocean and the sound through the channels of Edgartown Harbor and Cotamy Bay, lrnve ceased. There is the tradition of a continuous beach, and the closing of all inlets, as at present, in the early part of this century; and that people passed with teams from the main island to Chappaquiddick, but that the link was only temporary, a new-opening breaking through the her.eh again in a few months after it was closed. ·with this exception, there is no recorrl or tradition of the non-existence of an inlet through Cotam:r Beach since this section of the coast has been known. It is an interesting and important fact that we are able so accurately to determine the extent and nature of the changes which have occurred in this locality within the last twenty-five years, particularly in this beach, which is a type of many others along the sandy portions of our sea-coast, and presents much the same barrier against the encroachment of the sea, preventing the wasting a-0tion of storm-waves from extending into bays, lagoons, aml pouds. The length of Uotam,y beach, from cast to west, is about three and a half miles, and its average width about 450 feet: As ;;hown by my first awl last surveys, this beach has been beaten bodily northwanl a distance about equal to its width. As this beach has re-formed its general natural slopes while changing its position, we find a present depth of about 8 feet below higl1 water over the area occupied by the beach itself in 18.JJl, and also a corresponding depth on the inside of the beach; so that, in determining the amount of sand11 which have been moved, we must take them. from above the plane of about 6 feet below high water. The average height of the beach above high water is about 8 feet. This gives a gross amount of about 116,500,000 cubic feet. In other words, a bank or mole of sand, 18,500 feet in length, 450 foet wide, and 14 foet high, containing lll.l,500,000 cubic feet, has been beaten in upon the bay and shore, by the steadil~· encroaching action of the ocean-wayes, in a period of twenty-five years, a distance of 450 feet. This is not a case of any great convulsion or powerful current action. It is but a fair illustration of the gradual but unceasing ivaste which is going on upon such shores. · · The island of Mintha's Vineyard was probably visited and even settled upon by the early colonists. How great must be the contrast of the present shores with those they then explored, when we consider that, according to the ratio of change, Ootam,y Beach must then ha Ye been 4,500 feet to the seaward of its present line! · In extending my survey westward from Cotamy along the main shore of the island, I found the same encroachment of the ocean going on. Two ponds of some acres in extent, and having local names, were, at the time of my survey in 1846, about 4.10 feet back from the shore-line. These ponds are now entirels obliterated. The site of one is now occupied by the sand-hills of the beach, while a small tract of marshy ground marks the inner borders of the other. I found no important changes in the inner o;hores of Cotamy Bay, or at points not under the immediate influence of the ocean forces. With regard to the question of opening Cotamy Beach by artificial means, and thus restoring the former regimen of the bay and harbor, there seems to be but one answer to be given-it should be done at once. 'fhe great value of Edgartown Harbor as one of shelter, and the only perfect shelter, within reach of the mass of vessels sometimes caught by bad weather in the ·dangerous approaches to Cape Ood; the importance of an inlet or passage-way from the harbor son th ward for the smaller pilotboats peculiar to the island, which in certain winds 3nd Rt.orms can safely and quickly reach vessels needing a pilot off Muskeget Channel, through this southern inlet, wheu it would be impossible for them to round Cape Poge, or reach the ground of danger by any ot.her route.; the fishing inter-

238

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT 01<'

ests of Edgartown and its vicinity-an interest of much value, shared by a large proportion of the population, and so seriously affected by the loss of this safe and direct pathway to their fishing· grounds-all call for a{)tion and relief in the matter of this closed inlet. The most favorable point at which to re-open Cotamy Beach seems to bA at or near the west end or head of the bay. The arguments in favor of this location are as follows: 1st. The greater length of time that the 'inlet will probably remain open, assuming that it will move from west to east as fast, and close as soon after reaching its eastern limit, as the former inlets have done. 2d. The fact that this contracted section of the bay, by confining the tidal currents between the main land of the island and the beach, as they flow to and from the actual inlet, favors the formation and maintenance of a channel, through the shoal ground bordering the beach, into the deeper waters of the bay. 3d. Economy in cutting through the beach, as the cross-section at this point is about the minimum. _, Although an opening through the beach sufficient to.merely start the water running, if made at the time predicted by Professor Mitchell, may, and probably will, create a natural inlet, and such an inlet may answer the physical demands required to restore the tidal circulation through the harbor; still, the uncertainty of a sing1e tide doing the required work, and the contingency of an inter>ening storm or ocean sweh preventing the continued action of the succeeding tide, render the scheme of depending upon the scouring power of the tide alone a questionable one, unless accompanied .by a prepared pathway for it as far through the beach as practicable, and of such a width as shall at once secure, when opened, a stream of ponsidcrable volume; Apart from the physical importance and effect of opening an inlet through the outer beach, there are difficulties of navigation which such an inlet only would not relieve. As seen on the map or sketch which Professor Mitchell and myself jointly append t-0 our reports, there is a range of shoal ground bordering the beach, and extending from east to west along the entire south front of the bay. Professor Mitchell has stated in his report that this shoal ground has increased, within the last fifteen years, b;y the amount of about one million of cubic yards. This coincides with the popular opinion of the constant accumulation of material upon this ground, which is now so extensive and so sh.oal that it is difficult for the peculiar class of boats required for tl1e outside fishing and pilotage to cross it; in fact, they cannot <lo so, except by one or two tortuous and imperfect channels. If a channel-way through this shoal ground were made in connection with a new inlet through the beach, it would, of course, give great relief to the boating interest, both for pilotage and fish: ing. Here again the western section of the bay, before alluded to, presents naturally favorable ground for such a channel by improving what was once, probably, a natural channel leading to some former inlet. The question of how· much this pilotage and fishing interest are worth, or what the value of the former may be to the general security of navigation, I will not presume to answer. It is not, how. ever, an unreasonable supposition, that, within one year froJll opening an inlet and making such a channel-way, a vessel in distress outside may be saved by a pilot reaching her through this channel, and that the value of the vessel and her cargo ma.y 'be worth as much or more than the amount it -w:ill cost to make the channel-way. This is apart from the question of the saving or loss of life. In connection with this view of the harbor question, and in conclusion of the general subject, I have made some estimates concerning such a channel and inlet as I have named, which I submit for your consideration as suggestive items. As a basis for the general dimensions and character of a channel and inlet as proposed, I have taken a width about equal to the narrowest section of the natural passage-way between the harbor and bay, which is about 300 feet. This is not wider than desirable for a beating channel. The depth is regrilated by the class of boats in general use, which require about 4 feet at mean low water. As before stated, there are, in this part of the bay, the traces of a former channel through this shoal By following the general course of this old channel, and removing such portions of the

shoal as in places now block it up, a passage-way 300 feet wide and four feet deep may be obtained by the excavation of about 41,000 cubic yards of the material of the shoal. A corresponding excavation through the beach to the level of mean high water only, wl1ich is probably all that will be needed to insure a successful inlet, will require the removal of about 14,000 cubic yards of sand. · " " " " · · Upon the map, before referred to, which accompanies Prof~'lsor Mitchell's and my reports, I have shown the outlines of the beach and inlets as they han1 been determined by the several surveys which I have made. These surveys have all beeu based upon the original triangulation, and referred to the same base-lines, so that the changes shown are absolute. The last survey, although not involving much detail, required considerable time mid labor in its execution. The very changes which it was its purpose to determine had caused the loss of all points and land-marks along the outer shore of the island, so that a new series of points, lmsed upon the light-house and spires of Edgartown and the station on Sampson's Hill, had to be extended to the south shore of the island and to Chappaquiddick hefore the survey could be made. I had but a small party organization, and am indebted to Professor Mitchell and .M:r. l\larinden for many favors and much assistance in the execution of my field-work. Very respectfully submitted.

REPORT CONCERNING VINEYARD HAVEN: ITS CHAltACTER AS A PORT OF REFUGE AND ITS PRESENT CONDITION. BY PROFESSOR HENRY ~HTCHELL, IN CHARGE OF PHYSICAL HYDIWGRAPHY, TJNITED STATES COAST SUlWEY.

Dy a vote of the citizens of Holmes Hole Villa.ge, about a year since, the 11a.me of the place was changed to Vineyard Haven ; and at the request of tllese citizens the Post-Office Department adopted this new name, which is rapidly supplanting the old one in popular use. The village reall,y forms a part of the town of Tisbury, aml vessels are registered in accordance with this legal designation, as heretofore ; but in marine reports, the harbor is now called Vineyard llaven. · This port is distinguished neither for its amplitude nor its security, but pre-eminently for its convenience. Situated at the junction of the Vineyard and Nantucket Souncls, wl1ere the sailing courses change their directions about three points, and where the currents are too strong, often, to be stemmed by the smartest vessel beating t-0 windward, its position renders it invaluable as a halting-place, to wait for fair winds or the favorable moving of the waters. The depth in the anchorage, while it is not so great as to cause delay in weighing groundtackle, is ample for all classes of vessels. The access from the Sound is free and 1lirect, so that a very large majority of the vessels that seek the anchorage employ no pilots. But ports free alHl direct of access are liable, as a general rule, to be so exposed in storms as to render them unsafe; an<l Vineyard Haven is not an exception in this particular. The ship that runs into this anchorage before a northeast gale leaves an open door behind her. The comparative merits of different ports of refuge would form a very useful subject for a Coast Survey report, and I have long contemplated a trial upon this theme, in which the principal elements should be, fa-Oility of approach, depth of water, protcctivn fr01n the sea, shelter fro11i the winds, and character of the bottoni. But in this report I shall confine myself t-0 a comparison between Vineyard Haven, and its rivals more especially; although I shall add some other ports incidentally. In casting about for a type of perfection, rn the way of a harbor of refuge, I find I cannot do better than take Provincetown, which seems to fulfill all the requisite conditions; and therefore I place the table for this port at the head of my list, aud then follow with Vineyard Haven, which is the special sultiect of this report.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Provincetown Harbor as a type.-To enter this harbor from the ocean, a vessel must make a sweep entirely round the compass. She can never, therefore, run in before the wind all the way; but with an easterly gale she finds herself in smoother water, and well sheltered, before close-hauling becomes necessary; and, with the wind northeast, she does not care to enter the harbor proper, but finds snug anchorage under the Truro shore-for Provincetown has not only a basin, but an outer roadstead, nearly 13,000 acres of which are sheltered from northwest round to southeast. The limit of the inner anchorage on the side of the roadstead, we -assume to be a line drawn from the extremity of Long Point to the westerly end of the State Dike, inclosing an area of 741 acres, over which there is a depth nowhere less than 18 feet at mean low water. Table No. 1, and its illustrations upon our sketch, refer exclusively to the basin of Provincetown, it being deemed unnecessary to discuss the outer roadstead. From our central position the land may ·be seen, fl'om the deck of a ship, in every direction, aml the average distance does not exceed one mile and a quarter; although the maximum fetch is nearly six miles in the direction which just clears Long Point. In the most sheltered position, in which 18 feet at low water can he found, the ship at anchor is completely laml-locked-the greatest fotch being less than two miles, and the average only about a half-mile at low water. In a harbor of refuge absolute quiet is not so essential as in a port of lading or discharging. Upon our sketch No. 28 appear two sets of diagrams for the Provincetown exposure, which we give for the sake of comparing two methods of illustration. In the first set the old method msed for plotting winds is retained, with some improvements suggested by Mr. Marindin; while in the second set the reverse method is employed, in accord with your own suggestion. In both sets the lengths of the arrows are measures of the exposure. Since all the data of our table refer to the local effects of high winds, it has seemed proper to qualify the measures given for the "Fetch of the sea" by adding another column giving the "Angles of elevation" of the sheltering land. This last column has been computed from information supplied by Professor H. L. \Vhiting, who, with his own topographical surveys before him, has furnished the heights of the hills along our lines of direction. The angles being small, we have used their arcs as ordinates in plotting the profile of the land seen against the sky. It will be seen that the greatest shelter from winds is from west round by north to northeast, and that it is not deficient in southern quadrants. The average elevation (all round the compass) is 16', which is very large. for a harbor of such great capacity. Confining our attention still to the basin, or harbor proper, of Provincetown, let us inquire how many vessels it can accommodate. First-rate men-of-war, merchant-ships, and m·iscellaneous merchantvtJSsels are the three categories for which wc should provide. I was a little puzzled about how much swing-room to provide for a man-of-war, having no experience myself, and finding but one authority, and that a foreign one, among my books; so I wrote to Rear-Admiral Davis, who gave me. the clear statement which follows: " The estimate of Les pont.~ et chaussees is sufficiently correct-32 acres. ''A vessel properly moored in a tideway occupies, in fair weather, but little more space than that in which she can swing freely; but in order that she may ride in perfect security at all times, she ought to have room enough to enable her to veer out the whole length of the cable, in bad weather, in any direction from which the wind may come. "The standard cable's length is 120 fathoms = 720 feet, and this may be taken as the proper radius, although the whole of the cable cannot be paid out (the part between the hawse-hole and chain-locker remaining). This allows something for a spanker-boom prQjecting over the tackle. In the Navy w~ have longer cables for heavy ships, but the st,andard English measure will be more familiar to your readers." The above decided me to assume a radius of 631 feet, after making allowances for the reserve of cable on board the ship and for the slant. The depth of water required exceeds 23 feet at mean low water. With these data I plot 12 first-rate men-of-war riding at storm-anchors in the basin of Provincetown. ·

'rirn UNITED Sl'A'fES COAST SURVEY.

. 241

Of merchant-ships, requiring at least 18 feet of water and 310 'feet radius of swing-room, I find the number to be 85. Of miscellaneous merchant-\·essels, with arnrage radiw; mo feet, I find the number to be 246. Although many merchant-vessels are of much les,; draught than 18 feet, I still have adhered to this depth for my miscellaneous list, because, as a general rule, vessels do not like to run inside of this de)ilth, especially in heavy weather. Iu exposed roadsteads the sea will sometimes break in three fathoms, and in the sharp sea of many of our harbors a nissel heavily laden will plunge several feet as slie falls. It may be objected to my manner of reckoning swiug-room that isiuee Yes:,;eJ15 at auch(_lr are swept by the wind in the same direction, the whole estimated circle is uot required in each case. This criticism would be just, if, in practical experience, we could pack Yessels into the port as carefully as we plot their circles upon our chart; and if vessels were all built alike, so as to luwe the same hold upon the water, and thus be liable to yaw o\·er equal and corresponding sectors. I do not include fishing-vessels in my \hirtl c!ltegory, since their tonnage falls below the minimum taken. There have actually been seen 400 fishing-vessels at ancllor in Provincetown at the same time. Whether all of them were within our assumed limits I cauuot learn. In a harbor of refuge, there is advantage in a clean strand, where vesseh; having lost their ground-tackle may be beached without danger, and where ismall vessels may be laid bare by the tide to undergo repairs. Provincetown ITarbor possesses this advantage. Vineyard. Haven as a roadstead.-Having described tho natural advantages of Provincetown Harbor, we are prepared to inspect Vineyard Haven, ahd to determine to what extent this ·anchorage is a suitable refuge for our large and increasing fleet of coasters. In table No. 2, the exposures of this port are given for alternate points of the compass, from which it appears that the llhelter ill complete in the southeast and southwest quadrants; rather deficient in the northwest quaclraut; and decidedly had in the northeast quadrant. Indeed, there is no effective shelter from northeast round to east by north, although the Hedge Fence, Horse Shoe, and other shoals break somewhat the force of the sea in gales. But, we may certainly say, that with the wind from tlie open quadrant, vessels are no better off, as far as shelter is concerued, within the harbor limits than immediately outside in the sound. · Vineyard Haven is not then a Jiarbor, prop~rly speaking; it is a roadstead-not so safe as the roadstead of Provincetown, because the latter opens upon fairer quarters of the compa.ss, and has a good safe harbor to leeward when the wind blows in. There is no shelter to be reached from Vineyard Haven, when the wind blows in followed by a heavy sea. There is au interior basin, called the Lagoon Pond, which has good depth of water, but the entrance is blocked and obstructed by sand-bars and small shingle, so that it is rarely sought. In the sketch accompanying this report, I give the exposure of thiB port in comparison with that of Provinc6town, and add a profile of the surrounding country. The angles of elevation are based on the same authority as that stated heretofore in respect to ProYincetown, and may be trusted. · From our central position at Vineyard Hiwen, the maximum ele\·ation is 10 13' in a direction due west. The maximum for Provincetown lies in the same direction and is about half as great. The mean elevation for the western semicircle (south round by west to north) is for Vineyard Haven 32' against 19' at Provincetown. The mean for the southern semicircle is for Vineyard Haven 39' against9' at Provincetown. The mean for the southeast quadrant (which is a storm quarter) is at Vineyard Haven 36' against 7' at Pro\·iucetown. The mean for the nortbeast quadrant is for Vineyard Haven 5' against 17: at Provincetown. Jn this, the quarter from which come our most frequent storms, Vineyard Haven falls below par, and for a majority of tho storms fails altogether. The survey of Vineyard Haven, executed during the past season by H. L. l\farindin, Assistant, Coast Survey, enables us to measure very exactly all the advantages of this anchorage; and, by H. Ex. 206-31

REPORT OF THE

SUPERINTENDE~T

OF

comparison with the previous survey executed by our service in 1845, we are able to show the changes that ba\·e taken place. The plane of reference ador)terl by ns for correcting soundings was mean-low-water, while that adopted by Captain Blake in 1845 was one and six-tenths feet below. Our published chart, therefore, which was based ou the earlier survey, has never fairly represented 4bc capacity of the roadstead. In making comparisons, we have changed the datum of Captain Blake's survey so as to correspond with our own. 'fl.tis we could safely do, because the tidal obserYations, &c., of the earlier survey were all in our possession and in good order. Since 1845 the four and five fathom curves have moved ont toward the Sound. 'l'his ha:-; resulted from a slight shoaling, probably due to tbe deposits of sand torn from East and West Chops hy the sea. Professor Whiting's surveys of the past season, compare1l with those of previous years, show that these two Chops are losing ground at their extremities. Within the four-fathom line all the submei·ged contours have fallen back in more or less degree. This remark is to be uuclerstood in a general sense, lrncause there are points where the curves have advanced and others where they have retreated, the retreat being in excess. In my paper on the "Reclamation of Tide-lands," I offered as a theory, based on considerable observation and study of comparative surveys, tlrnt bays, exposed in the direction from which storm-wiuds are prone to blow, may be expected to extend; the contours within the influence of the waves having a tendency to fall back. Vineyard HaYen, quite unexpectedly, furnishes me with another illustration, in a small wa,y, supporting my vitows. Here, to be sure, the superficial area of the cove has diminished a little, not only because my limiting line, extending from East to West Chop, has fallen back a little, as the shores of these chops have washed away, but also because there has been a slight making out of the lJeach along the sides and near the head of the cove. As bounded by the (>-foot curve, the cove has retaiuetl about its old superficial area; as bounded by the 12-foot curve, it bas eularged 4 acres; and as liwited by the 18-foot curve, it has enlarged from 515 acres in 1845 to 544 in 1871-a gain of 29 acres; so that, far from there having taken place any decline of this port, a real improvement bas been in progress. Only three first-rate men-of-war can be accommodated in the anchorage, and these must occupy the most exposed situations. Sixty merch~mt-ships can, however, now find swing-room iu·the anchorage, against i3G in 1845. Of miscellaneous merchant-vessels comfortably accommodated, I find the number to be 174; although Rev. D. \V. Stevens, in charge of the" SaHors' Free ReadingRoom," reports that 200 have actually been seen anchored at one time, and that the average tonnage of those may be set down at 220 tons each. Of my 174, I claim that six per cent. is the gain since 1845. The dragging and fouling of ships in this anchorage are incidents exceedingly frequent. Vessels have had their masts cut away to prevent dragging, and one vessel is reported by Captain West, the light-keeper, us having foundered. The largest number of vessels driven on shore in a single storm is stated by Uaptain West at sixteen, and by Re,., D. W. Steveni; at fourteen. Tlle following extract from the report of the " Marine Agency of the Associated Press," for the year ending :March 22, 1870, will be found interesting: Arrival.s.-Steamers, 52; ships antl barks, 83; brigs, 627; schooners, 6,350; wlialers, 14; yachts, 25; sloops, 8-total, 7115H; of which 410 were foreign, mostly :British. Fishermen are not included in this list, but may be set down at 150 in the spring. Exclusive of the fishermen, the number of 11ersons on these vessels may be set down at over seventy thousand. In the foregoing I have endeavored to give, in brief, a fair view of the defects and merits of Vineyard Haven. By presenting first a model port of refuge, I have shown how far short of perfection the subject of my report falls, and yet I have beeu happily able t-0 demonstrate that no decline of advantages is taking place. I have furthermore shown, from reliable information, the use made of this refuge by foreign aml domestic vessels; and it remains to inquire whether this use is absolutely necessary, that is to say, whether other harbors in this neighborhood could not supply the place of Vineyard Haven or relieye it somewhat of its crowd. Great Woods Holc.-I have often heard the question asked, "Why do not vessels run into. Great Woods Hole, where perfect protection and quiet may be found, instead of crowding and crushing int-0 Yineyar(l Haven?"

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

243

Great Woods Hole, so called, to distingnish it from a neighboring cove known as "Little Woods Hole," is the only perfectly sheltered basin on the Sound, iuto which eighteen feet of wateL· can be carried at low tide. I have run into it many times; I know llow perfectly tranquil it is during violent gales, and how excellent the holding~ground is; but I know also that the approach from the Sound is rendered difficnlt b;r the strong currents, and dangerons by rocky ledges on either hand. The pathway is well marked by buoys, hut no stranger ventures into it without a pilot. Besides, it is too small to lie a rival to Vineyard Haven were its approach never so good. Of the miscellaneous class of vessels to which I haYe referred aboYe, only 18 can be so anchored as to swing free of each other, i. a little over ten per cent. of the Yiueyard Haven fleet when full, and not equal to the daily a\'erage of v~ssels seeking shelter. Edga.rtown Harbor.-This is a noble port of refuge, and I give the table for its shelter at the close of this report. It is a resort for coasters in easterly gales of great Yiolence, when it can be reached. But it lies several miles from the sailing-track of the Sound, and near no point of ordinary difficulty irt the Sound navigation. Vessels bound westward run safely on through the Sound, past the mouth of this harbor, in the midst of easterly gales, with the expectation of reaching Newport or some of the shelters of Blizabeth Islands, and with Vineyard HaYen as an alternati\·e; while vessels coming from the westward scarcely appreciate the violence of an easterly gale until imssing West Chop, where the expanse of the sea is thrown open, and the11 the tibno;;t that can be attempted is to get into Vineyard Haven. As Edgartown is not a halting-place in ordinary weather, the sudden springing up of au easterly gale finds a large part of the ileet already anchored at Vineya:rd Haven. Improvement of Yineyard Haven.-Thc employment of steamers in our coasting-tmde has not only failc<l to diminish the sailing-fleet, but really does not seem to retard the steady increase of the latter; and one of the problems that must soon demaucl solution is, hO\Y to iwoYicle room and shelter for these vessels at Vineyard Haven. This problem I have studied witll great interest, but not with much hope of success. I shall venture to touch lightly upon it, simply t.o indicate some initial steps in improvement. Any one who has witnessed a rush of V'es:;els into Vineyard HaYen has observed that they all crowd in toward tlie center, frequently with mutual injury, while in the upper part of the co,-e, and along either side, there remain large spaces unoccupied. Of course this is due, in part, to the timidity of the skippers, who do not kuow the character of the bottom near the land; but, in greater part, it is due to forethought of anchorage-room on getting under way. I luwe seen the entrance to the roadstead so blocked with vessels at anchor that I have been afraitl to attempt to run through the fleet into the unoccupied space (nearly thirt,y per centum of the whole auchoi:age) which lay higher up the cove. If mooring-buoys were to be placed along the margin of the auchorage-grouml, they would not only define the limits, so as to induce vessels to run boldly up tlle cove, but they would themselves supply means for securing at least fifty vessels in locations not now in common use. Proper police regulatiQns could provide that vessels running in by day-light should lNwe the entrance free for those arriving after dark. The form of the cove fits it peculiarly for this arrangement of buoys, since there are few irregularities in the submerged contours. The west shore is foul at some points out to the lll-foot curve, but the head of the cove and the east shore are generally free of rocks. The mooring-buoys might be placed along the Hi-foot (at low-water) curve, aud thus accommo· date ordinary coasters. Of course vessels wouhl usually be obliged t.o let go their own anchors, bnt they would prefer to do so near these buoys, to which, in case of a gale, they could make fast. They would also desire to make fast to them in getting under way. The hope of providing shelter for this roadstead is small. The entrance must not be closed · by jettees from the Chops; and the building of an isolated breakwater outside is impracticable, berause of the great depth of water and the strong tid~. The opening of a passage-way from the roadstead to the Lagoon is entirely practicable, and wouhl not be very expensini, hut this lagoon would freeze in winter, and remain frozen for long periods, perliaps. In this lagoon, as it now exists, without removal of its shoals, there is ample depth and area for forty.two merclmnt-vessels

swinging as free as in the roadstead, or quite double that number packed closely, as they could conveniently be in so quiet a place. The whole area of the Lagoon is lt trifle over 400 acres, against 544 acres of road:1tead (havi11g 1lepth of 18 feet and upward) in the haven. I purpose, m; llcfol'C stated, t.o attempt ultimately a larger range of comparison among our harbors than properly belongs to a report like this; and I luwe here added a few sample tables, in order to elicit comments and criticisms, which may be useful to me hereafter. The table of "~.\hchomge-room," No. 17, is iuten't!ed to be complete only for the harbors of Massachusetts, hut I ha\e added New York and Gardiuer's Bays as instances of grand anchorage-grounds. In making out this table I have premised tllat a man-of-war requires 23 to 24 feet, and merchant-vessels 18 feet low-water depth at the entrance of the port. I have moreover provided that each vessel shall have free swing-room IJ·iug at storm-anchors. As I have indicated heretofore, the amounts of anchorage-room do not, by themselves, furniRh true measures of the comparative values of tlifferent ports. Aside from any question of geographical position, or particular relations to interior water-courses, the harbors of New York ahd Boston, fairly compared, seem to me -very nearly equal, naturally, notwithstanding that the· former has more than five times the anchorage-room of t!Je latter. Boston Harbor has more than enough ancl10rage room ; and since it is divided into basins by high islands and promontories, it furnishes perfect shelter from wind and sea. It, moreover, has no outer bar, but offers grand channel-wa~'S from the open sea to the sheltered roadstead; and it · has no Rtrong currents to render the maueuvering of vessels rlifficult, or the movements of icefields dangerous. In these respects it is superior to New York. When, however, we come to compare the commercial basins ot the two ports, the upper harbor of Boston sinks almost into insignificance alongside of that of New York. Originally the territory now covered by the city. of Boston had more aYailable water-front, in proportion to area, than New York, aml the relative positions of the seYcral basins could not have been more happily arranged for commercial uses. But tbc land transportation stole a. march, for a while, on the maritime commerce, and, with hasty steps, threw bridges oYer the channels, shutting out from free access the best water-front of the city; so that now large snms of money are necessary to create and develop new frontages, and to enlarge the small basin tltat remains unollstructed by bridges, &c. Within the limit of a circle of 2.92 nautical miles radius from the State-house in Boston, the natural frontage, which could have been made available, is twenty linear miles, to over one-half of which there is no longer free access. A circle of the same radius, with its center in New York City, and its circumference passing through Jersey City, Brooklyn, and Williamsburgh, includes fourtflen and one-halt" miles of natural frontage, all of wb.ich remains free. Having no recent survey before me, I cannot state the total amount of improved frontage in the upper harbor of New York, but it does not fall short of twenty miles; while the improved frontage in Boston to which there is free access is only four and one-half miles . . The harbor commission has, however, entered upon a project which promises to supply the deficiency of wharf-room in Boston. You will appreciate the scope and spirit of this project after perusing the memorial addressed by the commission to the city of Boston, under date of May 13, a copy of which has been sent to you~"' Gardiner's Bay, with its perfectly sheltered tributary basins, is, perhaps, the best anchorage in the world. I could not adopt it, l1owever, as my type, because of its compound character, but I call attention to it as offering every qualification for a port of refuge. Under the lee of the great natural mole, from wl1ich the bay takes its name, or in the tranquil basins round Shelter Island, a Spanish armada might find room enough to ride out a gale in peace; I purpose to take up separately the fiord harbors of Maine, Narragansett Bay, and Long Island Sound when I come to my full report, because either of these districts has harbor-room enough for an empire, and in this respect presents a strange contrast with our Southern, Gulf, and Pacific coatits. I am indebk>d to my aid, Mr. J. B. Wefr, for much of the work which my tables have required, -------·. - - - - - - - "See Supplement of Boston Daily Advertiser of May 1\..

and I expect to rely very much upon his intelligent interest for going deeper into these subjects hereafter. I need not explain to you the absence of wind-diagrams from our sketch, because I have sought your counsel upon the proper manner of constructing these so as to show the relations of winds and waves. It is patent that we should cast out low velocities, and recognize the fact that beyond a certain limit the waves do not increase with the duration of tl1e gale. Yon have advise<l a further study of these points, and I, therefore, postpone the further consideration of this subject till more data are accumulated.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

REPORT ON PHYSICAL SURVEYS MADE AT .MARTHA'S VINEYARD AND NANTUCKET, DURING THE

SUMMER OF 1871, BY HENRY MITCHELL, CHIEF IN PHYSICAL HYUROGRAPHY, UNITED STATES
COAST Sl"RVEY. DEAR Sm: In response to a call from the .Massachusetts Board of Harbor Commissioners, you directed me to extend my project for the season so as to cover, as closely as required, the harbors of Edgartown, Vineyard Haven, and Nantucket, with their approaches by sound and sea. Presuming that the Boaru I have referred. to will be supplied with such portions of this report as may be deemed useful in considering the petitions for improvements which have come in from said localities, I shall arrange my notes in three brief sections, without reference to the actual order in which we have pursued the inquiries. I shall :first give a limited resume of the physical aspect and peculiarities of the neighborhood; then, from a strictly practical point of view, recount the results we have reached, and make such suggestions as these results seem to warrant; and, finally,' furnish in the usual form the elements of the field-work.

§ 1. PHYSICAL ASPECT AND PECULIARITIES .

.A. glance at the map of New England reveals in the general direction of the valleys, ponds, harbors, bays, and sounds, the traces of great forces moving from the north and east-forces which controlled, or developed themselves in, the movements of the glaciers, and ceased to operate, perhaps, before the present agencies of change existed. If we descend from the general features to the :;;tudy of details, we discover that the drift of the glacial period has been washed clown from the hills by the rain, torn from the headlands by the waves, and strewn along by the sea, so that original depressions are being filled up aud new features appearing, which we easily recognize as the result of natural operations now in progress. Upon the islands of l\Iartha's Vineyard and Nantucket, where the depressions arc generally transverse to the trenrl of the coast, barriers of sand have been thrown across them at the sea· margins, both upon the north shore and upon the south, but more conspicuously on the latter, which is more exposed to the storm-wa.-es of the ocean. One may recognize the strip of beach that crosses the lagoon of Viueyanl Haven as the same kind of" littoral cordon'' as the ridges of sand that cutoff Tisbury and other ponds from the ocean, and Chappaquiddick N eek, at the entrance to Edgartown, differs from Cotamy Beach only in its exposure. The main entrance to Edgartown from the north can only have been maintained by the tidal circulation, and the southern opening closed simply because the circulation was unequal to the tas~ of ~esisting the constructive efforts of the waves. That there was once an open passage-way from the sound to the ocean through.this harbor can scarcely be doubted, for the bluffs on either hand bear witness to the wear of seas to which under the present circumstances thay can never be subjected. It is probable that Cotamy Bay immediately after the melting of the glaciers was an open fiord; that the. sand driving along shore from the westward converted the :fiord into a bight, and the bight into a lagoon. The history of Greytown Harbor, Nicaragua, which I had the opportunity to study while a member of the committee of the National .Academy appointed to investigate it, furnished a similar order Of changes, shown by comparative surveys. 1n this instance a cove became successively a bight and a lagoon, by the advance of a sand-drift across its month. When the sands had nearly crossed, the opening took the form of an inlet, with a depression at the pass, and a bar outside. This inlet struggled for existence, but ftnaJJy closed. The ponds on the south sides of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket have all, perhaps, been little fiords, which have been shut up by the coastsands. The difference, however, between Cotamy Bay and the other sand-barred fiords is very great· when we consider that with two openings a great tidal circulation is possible. I cannot altogether agree with Professor Whiting in supposing that the beach has gone on accumulating till it presents a baITier difficult t,o overcome, because the power of the tidal circulation seems t-0 me out of all proportion to the obstacle. I incline rather to the impl'68sion that the outl.et, shifting to the eastward, has, in this instance7 happened to run its eotll'Se and close on the border of Muskeget

Ohannel before any great storm has occurred to open a new pass to the westward. lt will be tSeen, from what I shall say hereafter, that the opening must gradually lose its strong tidal current as it moves eastward, and very decidedly when it reaches l\foskrget Channel, where the contrasts of tidal elevations within and without diminish. Professor Whiting's repeated topograpllical survt·ys along tlle south side of Martha's Vine:yard show that the bluffs are being continually undermined by the sea, and since the waves, running before the prevailing westerly winds, strike the shore diag·onally, there is a tendency of all materials to work down to the eastward, a tendency which seems to have resulted in the choking up of all the indentations of the original shore-line, and finally iu the formation of shoals on the border of Muskeget Channel, where the coastwise movement is turned ofl:' by the great stream from the sound. I ha Ye no doubt that 'Vasque Shoal has receiYed supplies from the entire length of the south shore of the island, although in the main, perhaps, it is a product of the wear of the east shore of Chappaquiddick. This shoal, like the False Hook at the entrance to X cw Y 01·k, lies in the debatable <listrict between opposing movements of the sea. In many respects the openings through Cota my Beach, iu location and history, haye resembled those through Sandy Hook at Nayesink Highlands, known as the Shrewsbury Inlets. In both places the shifting has been induced by a diagonal set of the waves, and in both places the openings, after long travel, haYe been prone to close in particular neighborhoods, where they ham been compelled to halt and make a struggle for existeuce. The material which falls from the headlauds into the sea is not borne for off, but continually crowded toward the shore. .As the waves drive up the beach, great mrtsses of sand and stones are forced on shore, buL the reacting ''under-tow" carries hack al wa,ys a portion of the finer nmtrial. By the grinding action of the breaker, and the selecting operation of the under-tow, the strand becomes largely composed of fine sands, easily caught up by the dry winds, and formed into dunes, or galls, as the_)' are properly called, upqn Nautucket. The sea in,.its onset is constnwtire up to a certain elevation. It seems disposed everywhere to preserve a dike, but this barrier, unless augmented by wind-borne material, never exceeds a certain limit. It does not restrain the on~r-1eaping sea in the fury of the storm, but limits its peaceful domain. The most casual obserYer may distinguish in Cotamy Beach a contrast of appearauce between the wind-worn and water-1.r0t·n districts; the former characterized by irregular mouuds, the latter . by smooth surfaces, declining in either direction from a crest-line to the sea; in the one case the contours are apparently groups of concentric curyes, in the other parallel straight lines. In the profiles of different cross.sections, the two forms of beach are still more distinctly shown, i;o that in moRt cases we can positively assert that this is a <lune section where the wind arranges, and that a natural <like, still washed by the storm.seas. There are, it is true, some sections where the wind and the sea have both left traces of their struggle for supremacy, but these present little conf'msion to the careful observer, who easily distinguishes the traces of the water from those of the wind. The wind plays it,s part upon a stage previously raised by the water, ancl builds higher still. The coarse grasses which take root in the dunes arrest the flying sands still more effectually, and with them the fertilizing dust of the shore. In this way the levee thrown up hy the sea i1:1 gradually stretlgthened, till it becomes a permanent barrier against the storm. Where exposed to the open ocean, the levee maintained by the sea is sernn to eight feet aboYe ordinary high water; in bays and sounds, where somewhat sheltered, it is less. Of course stormseas easily pour over it, and these, by sweeping the sands from front to rear, cause the levee to move back without changing its form usually. The movement is like that of a dnne, but the slopes maintained are the reverse. The island of Nantucket is mainly a heap of glacial dri.ft. Except a Yery remarkable bank of oyster-shells, which crops out from Sankaty Head, about sixty feet below the brow of the cliff, no ante-glacial deposit is found. Mr. Edward C. Cabot, when attached to the Coast Survey party of Lieutenant Charles H. Davis, first called attention to this exceptional feature, and be ascertained that this bank was met with in digging wells in the interior of the island. It would be very interesting to explore this deposit, as you have encouraged me to do, and to ascertain if it is a shell levee, like those I have seen upon the shores of the Bahama Islands. If it is, its strike, and the .relations of its two slopes, would reveal the whereabouts of the ocean, and perhaps the height of its waves in those ante-glacial ages.

256

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Great Point, Coatue, aml the larger part of Smith's Point, are modem formations, and com· posed, probably: of material torn by the waves from the seaward side of the island. In the midst of the town is a long bluff, where the drift-deposit has been undermined by the sea, probably before the shelter offered !Jy Great Point and Coatue existed. I refer here to the "Bank" between Orange and Union streets, and its continuation in the quarter known as the North Shore. These ancient headlands are now coYered with houses, and their slopes grown over with grass. The Haulover, which it is proposed to cut through, connects the drift-mound known as Coskata with the main body of the island, and separates the Upper Harbor from the ocean. It has always been a portage for :fishing boats, as its name implies, and is nearly of the same form and area upon the maps of Des Barres, 1776; 'nlliam .l\Iitchell, 1838; Coast Survey, 1846; and Dr. l<'erdinand 0. Ewer, 1869, all of which represent actual surveys. The section given upon our sketch is the mean of three lines of lernls, following depressions from the harbor, on the one side, to the ocean on the other. The distance from rear to front is unusually short, yet still I claim that the form is that of a seabuilt dike. But even if this harrier be, as Mr. Jofleph B. ::\Iacy and others at Nantucket assume from their examinations, a remaining strip of the original dr(ft, we might still expect its exposed portion to wear the form impressed upon it by the sea; so that I do not give much weight to my own view, which is literally superficial, as yet. In the natural formation of an opeuing through the littoral curtlun of the coast, the wa-ves play only a preliminary part; it is tlie current which dios the channel. The oYerleaping waves weaken the dike, but it is b:y tilling the basin behind to overflowing that the breach is opened wide and deep. In cases like Ullatham, where the length of exposed beach is in very great ratio to the area of · the basin, the latter is ver:y liable to overflow, and inlets are the frequent products of great storms. The Haulover Beach, on the contrary, is so short from Ooskata to Squam that it does not admit many over-leaping seas, and therefore the basin within never, perhaps, swBlls to overflowing.* The experiment proposed is, therefore, one which nature may never have tried. The distinguishing peculiarity of the district under examination is its unparalleled tidal currents. Nantucket was called by the l'orthmen "Straumey," (Stream Island,) and the sound "Straumfiiird." t There is no otiler part of tile world, perhaps, where tides of' such Yery small rise and fall are accompanied by sueh strong currents running far out to sea. The navigator, approaching the coast, scarcely makes a land-fall before he finds his ship "rnoYed onward from beneath,'' and the same wonder fills him now that :first, perhaps, so long ago "mingled strangely with the fears" of those ancient mariners. There approach our coast from the ocean two oscillations of the tide, which meet, or (as ~'on express it) "form their node," southward of Nantucket Island. From Great Point, Nantucket, all along the outer coast of America to the northward, high water occurs at, or shortly before, the transit of tlre moon ; while from Smith's Point, Nantucket, along the outer coast to the southward, high water occurs four or five hours earlier. "South moon makes high water" and" South-eaBt m.oon ma-kes high irater,n are the sailors' rules respe.ctively applied to the two divisions of the coast we have uamed. My very close observations made in 1854 showed that the nodal-line intersects the shore-line of Nantucket between the meridians of 70° 0' and 70° 5', i. a short distance to the westward of the shoals. These two oscillations, entering the sound, the one by Gay Head and by Muskeget Channel, and the other by the Eastern Entrance, give very complicated tides between Tarpaulin Cove and Tuckernuck. In the small tides of Hblmes' Bole, Muskeget Channel, and Weweeder, (south side of ·------ --------------------------------------

i I infer that tlrn isla.ntl discovered in 1007 by Thorfiun tho Hopeful, "pa8t 1ohich there ran strong currellfB, which was also the 008e farther up the fiord," must have been Nantucket. Most of tl1e commentators of the Sagas awa-rd the discovery of the south shoro of New England to Lief, the son of Eric, but his men'tion of "much latid left bare by the ti.le '1 is fatal to tl1is interpretation of his account. Vinland, WI seen by Leif, must have lain U-Orthward of Cape Cod. The

palm for firet entry upon our field of inquiry belongs to Hopeful Thorfinn. Curiosity has led me to consult Wheaton's Northmen, the Antiquitates Americ:anre, .and some MS. k:Indly sent to me by F. S. Stallkneebt, member of the Roya.I Society of Antiquaries at Copenhagen.

It will be safe, however, to pro,ide for throwing open the canal two hours before t1ie time of transit given in the almanac. Those differences of leYel only are given in our taLle which f~wor the outflow and those only which fol1ow after the larger of the two tides which occur upon the.same day. Care should be taken to select this larger tide, aml this may be done hy reforriug to the heightR at Ilostou given in the tide-tables of the Coast Suryey for every day in the year. The differences of heigllt do not increase very much from :Neaps to Springs; but as the opening is to be made (according to our presumption) about the time of high water, tllere will be a i'laving of labor by se1ecting a period of high tides. There will also be a decided adrnutage iu selectiug a period of strong winds from north round to east, but winds from the opposite quadrant will pro\e yery unfavorable. Duriug tile period when ,tho surface of Cotamy Beach is al.Joye that of the ocean, i. c., from !lll 33m before till 4h tom after the transit, the current runs southward through Muskeget Channel, and sometimes feebly to tl1e westward along the outside shore of Cotarn~- Bay, hut the prevailing stream along this shore sets to the eastwnrd within the Wasqne Shoal. Tbe currents of Edgartown Harbor underwent an important change of regimen when the opening through the south beach closed. Lieutcmmt Davis's obserrntions in 1847 slwwed that the stream commenced to run by the town to the n01·tlurnrd, and out oYer tue bar, t'lo hours before low water~ and that it continued to hohl this direction till within two honrs of high water. As things are, now, the stream begins to run in over the bar, antl southward past the town, about the time of low water, and, with a single halt at the fourth honr, continues to rnn in nntil near time of high water. Under the old regimen, much more water flowed out to the northward than eyer returned. A glance at the tidal curves upon our sketch will show how this happened. When the tide was low in Ootamy Bay, it was high on the outside, so that the inlet and the chaunel o\·er the outside bar were broad antl deep, admitting a great volume of water. On the other harnl, when the bay was full, the tide outside was low, and the channels through the inlet and bar were much reduced. In my first attempt at anything like a scientific paper, over fifteen ~'cars ago, 1. cnllml attention to the fact that "about the same relat,i1m is preserved between tltc 1mrjacc~ of the icatet at Brant Point and lVcweedcr as betwee1i Cape Page and Wasquc, and tliat all the advantage& 1chich the harbor of Edgartown pos11csscs over that of Nantucket would seem to be due to the cxist.ence of a southern opening in the former case." I remember that this was based upon a comparison of levels which I had made from mere curiosity, and bad no reference to any proposed improvement at either of these ports.*

HEPORT OF 'l'HE SUPERJNTl'JNDEN'l' OF

The soundings in the harbor of Edgartown given npon the accompanying chart, executed by Mr. l\farindin, differ from those which appear upon tlw e1rnrt of Lieutenant Charks H. Davis, (dated 1846,) in three localities of limited extent. 1st. One foot more water can now be brought into tlie town basin over the bar. '.!d. The apron of sand within Chappaquiddick Point has extended so as to reduce the depth all the '1ay across tlle channel, and impair the holding-ground. The cross-section most encroaeherl npon bas lost al{out twenty irnr centnm of its area. 3d. An increase of the bulkhead or shoal in the broadest portion of Cotamy Bay has occurred, and amounts to nearly one million of cubic yards. . From inquiry :unong the citizens of Edgartown, I learned that the increase of water over the bar had not been uoticed by them, so I conclude that it may be nothing new, but a gradual change of past ;years. It was quite otherwise with the apron of Chappaquiddick Point, which had excited attention by its recent a<lrnnces. The shoal in Cotamy Bay had undergone so many modi-· fications of form within tlle memories of pilots and boatmen, tliat their testimony "\\as uncertain. 'Gntil we can have still another surrny, we must infer that the two years' closure of the beach has not affected the bar or bay, bnt ltas conduced to the shoaling of the main channel, mH1 has greatly i·educed its width at one point. 'Yhat this change llortends I do not <lare pre<lict, but I agree witlt the good people of Edgartown in thinking something ought to be done to stop it forthwith.

----------It will be ol:served that between Sinscouset and Great Point the tides belong to t1ie eastern system, but are not free from the admixture of the western system, which prevails as far as vVeweeder. The tide of Nantucket llarbor also belongs to the eastern system, so that we have, on either side of the Haulover, modifications of the same ti<le-wan1, ancl not distinct tidal systems, as at Cotamy on :Martha's Yineyard. The delay, however, and the distortion of profile which the tide undergoes in its passage to the upper harbor, give rise to a considerable contrast of elevation on the two sidt:s of the Haulover, amounting to over one foot at the time of maximum difference, an hour after the low water and two hours after the high water of the upper harbor. From the best that I can do with computations from stations so distant from the scene, I should say that from the time of high water (in the UPllfil' harbor) until within two hours and a half of _low water, the surface of the upper liarbor is above that of the ocean. For scime little time befot'e high water the stream would be continuous through the narrows into the upper harbor, and out through the inlet into the sea. The reverse would be true at low water. It will be very easy, from a fow obseriations on either side of the Ilaulo\"er, bt>£ore the cut is made, to determine more exactly the relations upon which I now speak so timidly. By connecting the observations of a few days with the benehes of my long series at other points; the propet moment for throwing open the communication may be pre· dicted with certainty in terms of interval after the transit of the moon.

The mo\erneut into the basia from outliidc will exceed in yelocity that which, six hom·s later, will obtain in the opposite directiou; so that an interior accm~ulation of sand will be likely to occur as well as a bar outsi<le. The basin or the upper lrnrbor ·is, howf;yer, deeper than any other part of the port, and not now used for commercial purposes. The coastwise cul'l'entt! rire strong off Siascnnset and also at Great Point, but oft the IIauloYer they are feeble. Captain George \Y. Coffin, of Siasconset, made current obserYatiouR for me along the east shore of the island in 1s.:;,;, and it is to these that 1 refer. There are few cases where :t comrnuuity hrr-,e less to lose b~- the :failure or more to gain lly the success· of an enterprise. The uew passage-way would lmild up the fishing interests of the place; it would also Im an an·uue for pilots carrying hope and as:sistauce to yessels bewildered among the shoals, and for life-boats bound on errands of merc.Y. It is flYe and a half nautical miles from tlie IlauloYer to the north end of Bass Rip; it is oYer sixteen miles to the same point from the present opening of the harbor at Brant Point, following the shortest water-route inside of fop Point .Rip.

In tho harbors of E<lgartow·n and \"ineyarrl liaYen there ·were executetl 139 linear miles of soundings, containing a total of 20r3J7 casts of tlie lead; 2 701G angle:'! were measured; fl current and three tidal stations were occupied. The current obserYationR were t:iken at difiereut depths wheue.-er the station lay in tllc channel. The stations in the Souml were occupied with a Yiew to deterwine causes of the rewarkahlc shoal known as the liedge Fcncp; lint I am not :;;afo:fi,·d that -we fnll,\ understand this shoal yet, so I do uot report upon it. The bench of our Rnrn·y at Edgartown is foe outer edge of the irater-table, (or st>t-off at top of stone foundation,) under the wimlo11 on foe right-hand side, on entering tlic front door of the :Martha's Yineyard National Bank. l\Iean lovi' "·ater. as obscryed upon our gauge at town wharf, (about 500 feet distant,) is 1."J.IG feet belcnv this bench, high water 13.16 feet, aucl the highest stormticle of the last twenty years, (with wind E. S. E.,) 1 (LiO. Tlte storm-tide reierred to wm; obsen-ed hy 1\Ir. Dunliam, in N oYemher, 18';']. It rose allout two-tenths of a foot higher than a previous remarkable rise observed by him 11mny years ago. The tide of Cotamy Bay, since the closing of the beach, has the same form as that at tlw tPwu wharf, 1mt occurs al1out a quarter of an hour later. I have made two yisits to Nuutneket, in tlw first of which I in·ocurerl the three sections of the Harwover, the mean of which appeiirs upon our chart. The second Yisit was fruitless, hy reason of a snow-storm, which interrupted operations. Before closing this report I ought to call your attention to the hydrograpby executed by m;y excellent assistant, II. L. l\farin<lin, which is good. Acting under my ad dee, he did not co-\er tht> ground equally, but expended the most labor where most m;efnl. The pre-dons chart of Lieutenant (now Hear-Admiral) Davis, althoug·h made in the early days of our service, has furnished a secure base of comparison. O\·cr a large part of the field the t\YO surYeys agree, and where this is not the case, the causes of chnugc liaw been inyestigated, and close work execute<l . .Mr. :F. H.
