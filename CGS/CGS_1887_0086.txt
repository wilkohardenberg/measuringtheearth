COAST .A.ND GEODETI0 SURVEY OFFICE,

Washingt01i, December 12, 1887.

Sn. : The report of progress made in the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal
;v'lar ended June 30, 1887, which I have the honor to submit herewith, in accordance with law and with the regulations of the Treasury Department, shows that every branch of the Survey has been actively prosecuted during the year to a degree commensurate with the means afforded by Con· gress. Estimates approved by the Department having been largely reduced, field operations were necessarily restricted, and I would again urge the importance of obtaining, for the proper development and economical conduct of the work, appropriations to the full amount of the approved estimates. .A careful analysis of the appropriations made in the Sundry Civil Expenses Act for the present fiscal year shows that for objects and purposes depending upon or related to the care and maintenance of the country and the Government, there was appropriated by that Act the sum of $16,468,526, and for those relating to or dependent upon their growth and development, the sum of $5,918,015, or about 36 per cent. That the Coast and Geodetic Survey, in its appliances, methods, purposes, and results, is essentially a work bearing a close relation to the growth and development of the country can hardly be denied. For its service for the fiscal year 1887-'88, the amount estimated ($560, 765) was less than one-tenth of the sum allotted to the needs of growth and development, and for the fiscal year 1888-'89, an aggregate somewhat less is submitted· for the approval of the Treasury Department. In its general form and in the arrangement of its parts, this report follows those published since and including the year 1882. A systematic arrangement was then introduced into Part I, which included statements of general progress in :field-work, office-work, and special scientific work; this was continued in the reports for 1883 and 1884, and enlarged in 1885 by a list of the Notices to Mariners published during the :fiscal year. The summary statements of general progress given in Part I are amplified in Part II, and are arranged in tabular form and in a geographical order in Appendix No. 1, Part III. Other appendices which have place in Part III are those giving the statistics of the field and office work of the Survey for the fiscal year (Appendix No. 2), a table of the information furnished to Departments of the Government in reply to special requests and to individuals upon application (Appendix No. 3), and the annual reports of the Assistant in charge of Office and Topography and of the Hydrographic Inspector for the fiscal year (.Appendices· Nos. 4 and 5). The appendices which follow these are referred to under the heading "Specia.1 Scientific Work" in Part I. They contain reports or discussions of the methods and results of the Survey which have been deemed worthy of publication. · In the map of general progress (Sketches Nos. 1 and 2), which a-0companies this report, the advance made in the several operations of the Survey up to June 30, 1887, is exhibited graphically. A separate map (Sketch No. 12), shows the progress of the work in Alaska to the same date. The index maps which are appended show the limits of the several classes of charts published by the Survey for the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts of the United States.

PA.RT I.
During the past fiscal year, field operations, including triangulation and topography, astronomical and magnetic work, were carried on within the limits or on tile coasts of twenty-seven States and three Territories, and in the District of Columbia. Hydrographic surveys were prosecuted in the waters or off the coasts of seventeen States and two Territories. Effort was concentrated in pushing to completion important surveys already in progress, and in beginning those imperatively demanded by the interests of commerce and navigation. Special attention was given to the study of the ph:ysical changes in Monomoy and its shoals; to the completion of the resurveys of Long Island Sound and of New York Harbor and its approaches; to the formation and movement of ice and of shoals in Delaware River and Bay; to the investigation of the currents of the Gulf Stream, and to resurveys of the harbors of San Francisco and San Diego. Ad··ance was made in the special triangulation begun in 1884 at the request of the Commissioners of the topographical survey of the State of Massachusetts; the surveys asked for by the Ilarbor Board of Baltimore to define port-warden Jines in that harbor, and to connect them with the triangulation, were made; the boundary line between the States of Virginia and North Caro. Jina was determi11e!l at the request of the Commissioners of those States; hydrographic resurveys and examinations were made at New Inlet, North Carolina, Saint Simon's Sound, Georgia, and Atchafalaya Bay, Louisiana. A special examination was made in Charleston Harbor to determine any changes of deptll due to the effects of the earthquake. On the coasts of California and Oregon, of ·washington Territory and of Alaska, surveys were in active progreRs. The basis for accurate National and State surveys afforded by the transcontinental triangulation authorized by act of Congress March 3, 1871, and intended to connect the work on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, has been extended by the continuation of geodetic operations in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Tennessee, Indiana, and Wisconsin, and by a survey begun towards the close of the fiscal year in the State of Minnesota, the only State which had made requisite provision for its own t-0pographical and geological surveys, as provided in the act just referred to, and in which points bad not been already furnished. The general statements of progress which follow are classified under the heads of "FieldW 01·k," " Office-Work," "Discoveries and Developments," and "Special Scientific Work."

II.-OFFIOE-WORK.
In the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, which is charged with the duty of making the results of field-work accessible to the people and to the Government by the speediest and most economical methods, the efforts of the Assistant in charge were heartily seconded by the chiefs of the several office divisions, and the annual report of that officer (Appendix No. 4) indicates increased efficiency and economy of administration. A more detailed notice of office operations is given towards the close of Part II of this volume. They are here briefly summarized. During the fiscal year there were published twenty-four new charts and nine new editions of charts, ten new charts and four new editions being from engraved plates; fourteen new charts and five new editions from pbotolithographs. There were printed thirty-five thousand one bun·

dred and thirty charts, of which number twenty-nine thousand eight hundred and fifty-two were from engraved plates and five thousand two hundred and seventy-eight from stone. Distribution was made of thirty-four thousand and sixteen copies of charts. Of this number eigllt tl10usand eight hundred and twenty-four were for the use of the ExecuthTe Depa!'tments, two tllousarnl five hundred and fifteen for Congress, and twenty-one thousand and ten were sent to agents for sale. Twelve Notices to Mariners were issued during the year, and twelve thousand copies of these Notices were printed for distribution. Tide-Tables, predicting for 1888 the times and heights of the tide on the Atlantic aml Pacific coasts, were in preparation and are now published. Upwards of fonr hundred and eighty copies of the third edition of Subdivision No. 13, Atlantic Local Coast Pilot, including the south coast of Long Island, New York Bay, and Hudson River, were printed. The manuscript of a new edition (the fourth) of the Pacific Coast Pilot, was nearly completed for publication. Of the Annual Reports for various years, two thousand eight hundred and one copies were distributed. III.-DISCOVERIES AND DEVELOPMENTS. Reference was made in the last annual report to the beginning of a series of Notices to Mariners which should be published quarterly, and should contain a list -of all corrections made to the charts of the Survey during each quarter of the fiscal year; also lists of charts canceled, new charts issued or in preparation, and the more essential parts of the special Notices which are from time to time published announcing dangers to navigation, cllanges in lights, buoys, and depths in channels, etc. The value of this quarterly series Roon became so manifest that the Hydrographic Inspector, at whose instance it had been begun, recommended a monthly issue, and towards the close of the fiscal year arrangements had been perfected for carrying this recommendation into effect. For part of the information incorporated in this series of Notices, the Survey is indebted to the Light-House Board and to the Bureau of Engineers. Following is an abstract of the Notices issued during the fiscal year: No. 77 (September 30, 1886). Coast of the United States. Chart corrections during the quarter ending September 30, 1886. No. 78(October13, 1886). Atlantic coast. Velocity and direction of the Gulf Stream between Fowey Rocks, Florida, and Gun Cay, Bahamas. No. 79 (October 15, 1886). Atlantic coast.

IV.-SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC WORK.
HEIGHTS FROM SPIRIT-LEVELING OF PRECISION BETWEEN MODILE1 ALA., AND CARROLLTON (NEW ORLEANS), LA.

In Appendix No. 9, Assistant Schott discusses the methods and results of the lines of geodesic leveling which were run by Assfatant Weir between Mobile and New Orleans in 1885-'86. The geodesic micrometer levels used in this work are described and illustrated, and the modes ot using them explained, in Appendix No. 15, 1879, and in No. 11, 1880. Assistant Weir's methods were the same, with the important exception that instead of running a simultaneous double line

6

UNITED STATES COAST A:ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

of levels with reversal of direction for alternate sections, be secured two independent measures by running a single line in one direction, followed by a single line in the opposite direction. As the reversal of direction took place either about the middle of the same day, or on different days, according to circmnstances, the conditions of the instrument and of the atmosphere wern diflcreut for the two measures, and the results should therefore be of greater value than by the method previously followed. From a discussion of probable errors, Mr. Schott finds that the measure from Mobile to Carrollton (New Orleans) is one of great accuracy. By a comparison of his results with those of the Mississippi River Commission, referred to the tide-gauge and bench-mark of that Commission at Biloxi: .Miss., he determines the heights of the bench-marks at Mobile and Carrollton above the average Gulf level, aud at the close of his elaborate paper gives a table of the resulting heights of the permanent bench-marks between Biloxi and Mobile above the average or half.tide level of the Gulf. A feature of the report which will ham special interest for geodesists is the inquiry into the magnitude of the deflection of the Yt'rtical depending upon the disturbing influence of the differential attraction of the snu and moon, the conclusion reacl1ed being that tl1is disturbing influence is of so minute an order that it is masked entirely b;r the probable uncertainties of the measure itself.
ON 'l'HE MOVEMEN'l'S OF THE SANDS AT THE EN1'RANCE TO VINEYARD SOUND.

A question of practical interest relative to the mo\Tements of the sands at the eastern entrance to Vineyard Sound is discussed b_y Assistant Henry J\Iitcbell in a paper pulilished as Appendix No. 6 to this volume. vVhat are the dangers to commerce which are threatened by these movements and by the chauges which they in vol Ye in the sh.oals f The report on 1\fonomoy and its Shoals, which was puhlished as Appendix No. 8 to the Annual Report for 1880, was a :stril!tly Listurical sketch, nor was an.> thing more contemplated at that time; but the discovery of the influence of stage in the l'eceut ph,ysical surrny of New York Harbor gaYe new meaning to tlw tidal arnl current obsenations made hy Mr. Mitchell's party thirty years a.go in the Vine~·ard Sound and its approaches, aud it was therefore determiued to recompute them so as to bring out their relatiol!s to the deposits aJHI their movements. By reason of the highei· stage the current that flows southward along the Monomoy peninsula and westwanl through Butler's Hole not only carries a larger volume of water but at a greater velocity than' the re\Terse tide. "The sands from the north press into the Vineyard Sound, uot simply because it offers a dead angle or pocket, but also because there is a draught through to tbe southwestward." Studies from comparative surveys and obi;;ervations of currents and waves give some grounds for apprehending that this entrance to the Sound may close.
FLUCTUATIONS IN THE LEVEL OF LAKE CHAMPLAIN AND AVERAGE HEIGHT OF ITS SURFACE ABOVE THE SEA.

In connection "ith the systematic survey of Lake Champlain which was made part of the duty of the Coast Survey by Congress in 1870, it became necessary to decide upon some plane of reforeu<w to wbicb the soundiugs of the lake, taken in difterent months and years, shoulrl be reduced as a standal'(], and as beariug a close relation to this inqair,y was the collection of data and observatious to determiuc the aYerage elevation of the lake above the half.tide or mean level of the sea. The irregnlar, periodic, and secular variations in the lake level are discussed by Assistant Scl1ott in a paper which appears as Appendix No. 7 to this volume. Certain anomalies in the monthly fluctuations of level as derive<l from observations made between 1871 and 1882, led Mr. Schott to compare the fluctuations in the level of Lake Champlain with those of Lake Ontario. For I~ake Ontario he obtained monthly means from observations between the years 1859and11'81, and was thereby enabled to deduce laws of cha11ge which show the need of a longer series of ohservations at a station on Lake Champlain. Authorities were found to differ considerably as to tbe average elevation of tbe lake above tl1e ocean, and to differ largely in regard to its greatest depth, the figures for depth ranging from 282

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

7

to 600 feet. Mr. Schott gives as a result of his investigations 402 feet for the greatest depth and 97.2 feet for the height of the average lake level abo>e the mean leYel of the sea. He finds also from the observations made between 1871 and 1882 an extreme fluctuation of level of 7.99 feet, the highest stage of water observed during that period being 5.21 feet above the average level, and the lowest stage 2. 78 feet below it.
ABSTRACT OF THE RESULTS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL AND MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THE INTERNATIONAL POLAR EXPEDITION 'l'O LADY FRANKLIN BAY IN 1881-1884, UNDEJt COMJ.IIAND OF LIEUT. A. W. GREELY, U. S. ARMY, AND IN ACCORD.A.NOE WITH SPECIAL DIRECTION GIVEN BY THE COAST .A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The co-operation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the organization of the scientific work of the International Polar Expedition to Lady Franklin Bay, 1881-1884, under the command of Lieut. A. W. Greely, U. S. Army, bas become well known through the history of that expedition published by its leader. In Appendix No. 10 to this volume, Assistant Schott present<> an abstract of the results deduced by him from the astronomical and magnetic obserYations made at the International Polar station, Fort Conger, the records of which were placed in his hands for discussion and for preparation for the press. The high northern latitude (81 o 44') of this station; the length of time during which the magnetic observations were kept up; the care taken to make them conform in arrangement to the general international programme, and the steady persistence and faithfulness of the observer, will give special value to the results and amply repay the very laborious work of computation, when it shall be possible to compare them with those of other expeditions orgauized during the same period. Mr. SchoWs paper embodying the record and full discussion of the observations was communicated by direction of the Superintendent to Lieutenant Greely, and published by him as Appendix No. 139 to the second volume of his report.· The abstract referred to in this notice gives a summary of the chief additions to our knowledge of terrestrial magnetism as derived from the Fort Conger observations, and concludes with a statement urging the importance of a new determination of the American Pole of Dip.
GULF STREAM EXPLORATIONS. OBSERV.A.TIONS OF CURRENTS,

1887.

Lieut. J.E. Pillsbury, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, presents in Appendix No. 8 to this volume a full report of his observations of the currents of the Gulf Stream in the winter and spring of 1887, together with a summary of results obtained and a comparison of these with the results of the two seasons preceding. In Appendices No. 14 of 1885 and No. 11 of 1886, Lieutenant Pillsbury described the appa. ratus which he has devised for this work and the ruetho<ls adopted for it. The expeditions of those years were devoted to an inyestigation of the currents of that part of the Stream uetween Fowey Hocks and Gun Cay, its narroweBt part, with tlie object of ascertainiug the laws governing the flow. In 1887, the current stations occupied crossed tlle Stream in three sections, one between <Jape San Antonio, Cuba, and Cape Catoche, Yucatan; a secoud, between Rebecca Shoal, Flori\la, and Havana, Cuba, and a third, normal to the coast off Cape Hatteras. All of these sections were of much greater depth tllan any before attempted for observations of currents, and not the least g~atifying feature of the season's work was the ability to anchor the steamer safely and expeditiously in these depths. The greatest was off Hatteras, in 1,852 fathoms, and that, too, with a surface current of over four knots. A most interesting result of the observations off Hatteras was the disceivery by direct evidence of the existence of tidal action and of a polar counter·currcnt underneath the Gulf Stream water. After an account of certain improvements made in the apparatus, the report discusses the general characteristics and limits of the Stream at each cross sectiOn; its daily variation; its axis; its depth, and velocity at different depths; and finally compares the resultrs obtained from the rse\~.

eral sections, recapitulating their points of similarity or dissimilarity, and giving a summary of the conclusions arrh·ed at. The report is accompm1ied by diagrams in which the observations are represented graphically, aud by a i)roject of lines for the further development of thP Gulf Stream current. Lieutenant Pillsbury observes that, having investigated the currents of the Stream on two sections where they flow north and on one where they flow east, it becomes of importance to have observations made where the flow is westwanl or contrary to the direction of the earth's rotation, as in the passages uetween the Windward Islands through which the Stream enters the Caribbean Sea.
THE UNDER·RUN OF TIIE HUDSON RIVER, ITS RELATION TO NEW YORK BAR, AND THE COURSES OF THE HUDSON TIDES THROUGH NEW YORK HARBOR.

There appears in Appendix No.15 to this volume a paper on the "Results of· the Physical Surof New York Harbor," in which Assistant Henry Mitchell presents some of his latest studies respecting this harbor, with special referencP to the courses of the Hudson tides through it, and to the under·run of the Hudson as related to New York Bar. Preceding the discussion of the physical hydrograph:y of the harbor under these beads, it will be remembered that there was published a paper (Appendix 13, 1886) in which Mr. Mitchell announced the discovery of a resultant or net discliarge through the harbor from Long Island Sound to the ocean, the effect of which is to keep the port open in winter and to sweep the sand from its threshold. '.rhe term under-run he applies distinctively to the current that predominates along the bed of the channel, carrying salt water and probably sewer ,.,.-aters to interior basins during the dry seaso11, when the head of the river falls below that which is necessary to counterbalance the heavier waters of the sea. The 1uoposition to improve Gedney's Channel by dredging, raised the question as to the limit of the i1atnral scouring power of curreuts, and whether the under-rwn might not, offset the resultant from the Sound when greater depth should be reached; but Mr. Mitchell found from the observations of past years tliat the neutral pla.ne (at which flood and ebb would be equa1) lay below the present level of the bar. Details of observations are given in the report, wbich is illustrated by diagrams and accompanied by a table of densities of the water at different depths at the Narrows, in the East River at Nineteenth street, in the Hudson River at Thirty-ninth street, and at Dobbs Ferry. ,·. In the Becond part of bis report Mr. Mitchell furnishes tables showing th'.:l slopeB of the Hudson and t11e East Rivers for each hour between successive transits of the moon, with statements of the tidal conditions at these hours, to confirm bis conclusion that the Hudson has two outlets for its commerce, but only one for its waters.

V.-DESCRIPTIVE REPOB.TS TO ACCOMPANY ORIGINAL TOPOGRAPHICAL AND HYDROGRAPHICAL SHEETS.
\Vbile the annual reports of operations required by the regulations of the Survey from each chief of a field party have not unfrequently contained valuable statements descriptive of the gen· eral character and prominent physical and geological features of tbe area included in the survey, if on land, and of the aspect of the coast on approaching from sea, of landfalls, harbor improvements, etc., if on water, there had been until the present year no systematic formulation of 'i what to observe," and no uuiform method of placing upon record varied results of observation directed to specified objects. In April, 1887, at the instance of the Superintendent, a boarti of officers was convened, to whom the subject was referred, with instructions to consider and recommend a schedule of topics, topographical, physical, hydrographical, and statistical, which might properly come under the notice of field officers, and from which they should select points of inquiry to be reported upon. The members of this board were: Assistant C. O. Boutelle (chairman), Assistants B. A. Colonna and Henry :Mifobell, Lieut. Commander \V. H. Brownson, U.S. N., Hydrograpbic Inspector, and .Assistmits E. Ilergesbeime!' and H. G. Ogden.

Sugge~tions were recefred from Assistants George Davidson, A. F. Rodgers, J. S. Lawson, and from Lieuts. J.M. Hawley ancl G. H. Peters, U.S. N. The schedule of topics adopted by tbe board after full consideration of the subject was printed for distribution to field-officers. It is published also as Appendix No. 11 to this volume. Eacll report, when received at the office, is to be sent to the archives for a register number, which must always be the same as the topographical and hydrographical sheet to which it refers, and the sheet must bear a reference to the report by number and date.

VI.-GENERAL INDEX TO THE PROGRESS SKETCHES AND ILLUSTRATIONS, MAPS, AND CHARTS PUBLISHED IN THE ANNUAL REPORTS OF THE U. S. COAST SURVEY AND U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY FROM 1844 TO 1885, INCLUSIVE.
In the Annual Report of the U.S. Coast Survcv for 1854, pages 280 to 285, was published a con<t solidated index to the sketches embraced in the teti preceding reports from 1844 to 1853, inclusive. A similar index to the sketches published in the annual reports from 1854 to 1863, inclusive, appeared the Report for 1864, pages 309 to 315. These indexes were preliminary in their character, no classification of the sketches, progress diagrams, charts, or illustrations having been attempted, and no alphabetical arrangement of titles adopted. This was doubtless not needed in 1854, but it would have been desirable ten years later. The need of a general classified index* to these sketches, charts, and illustrations for the entire series of reports is now recognized\_ and the work of preparing it has been undertaken by Assistant Edward Goodfellow. Its arrangement is under the followiRg heads: I. General progress sketches, showing the progress of the survey on the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific coasts of the United 8tates. II. Sketches showing progress in sections or portions of the coast and interior. III. Maps and charts. IV. Diagrams, drawings, and miscellaneous sketches, illustrating the methods ancl results of the survey. Under I, the order is that of the years of the reports. Under II and III, a geographical order will be observed, beginning at Passamaquorldy Bay and ending at the Rio Grande for the Atlantic and Gulf coasts; beginning at San Diego and ending at the Aleutian Islands for the Pacific coast, and for the interior States, extending westward from the eightieth meridian. Under the subheadings of III, which will include successive portions of the coast, the maps au<l charts relating thereto will be arranged alphabetically for convenience of reference. Under IV, the diagrams, drawings, and miscellaneous sketches, illustrating the methods and results of the survey, will IJe indexed under subject heads in an alphabetical order.

EXPLANATION OF ESTlllATES.

The estimates submitted to the Department for the fiscal year 1888-'89 were accompanied by the following statement: "U. S. Co.A.ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 0FFIOE, ''Washington, October 6, 1887. "Sm: In transmitting for your approval the estimates of the appropriations required for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal yea1· ending June 30, 1889, I have the honor to submit the f\>llowing explanation: "Exclusive of the estimates for printing and binding, which are the same each year, the aggregate of the estimates ($559,885) is slightly less than the aggregate of the estimates for the eurrent year ( $5G0,7G5). All items of field-work, to which has been added the item for 'Repairs of ressels,' are included under the classification of 'Party expenses,' and they comprise only kinds of work which have had the annual sanction of Congress and the example of nearly all civilized countries for many years. They are selected as being the most urgent of a much larger numbn of items whose importance is asserted by the most competent opinion in both the civilian aml naval arms of the service. They provide for the prosecution of operations on the uncomplete<l portions of the coast-work at as rapid a rate as iti practicable, and they contemplate for purpose8 of hydrography all that the Hyclrographic Inspector has requested or can profitably use. They are adjusted in amount with reference to the longest practicable maintenance of parties in the field, the importance of which to the economical prosecution and completion of work was <liscussed in my letter transmitting the estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1888 (page 291 Appendix G g), to which I respectfully refer. "The estimate for 'Party expenses' covers the pay of those temporarily employed as recorders, signal-men, hands, cooks, drivers, or boatmen, or in any other capacity in connection with fieldwork except as field-officers or members of the permanent or normal force; the commutation (or subsistence) of the chiefs and employes of parties; traveling expenses to and from the field, and local transportation in the vicinity of field-work or in connection with it; the transportation of instruments, tents, stationery, materials, outfit, and equipage to the field and in the field, an<l the purchase of all requisite materials, supplies, tents, boats, stationery, ani camp equipage for use in connection with field-work, and all other necessary expenses properly incident to the prosecution of field-work. "I have included an estimate for the amount of the annual contribution by this Government ($450) to the expenses of the International Geodetic Association for the Measurement of the Earth, and also the amount ($550), or so much as may be necessary, to defray the expenses of the attendance of a delegate from this Government at the General Conference of said Association in 1889 or 18HO, the American delegate being expected to attend the conference once in three years at its place of meeting in Europe or America. The sums mentioned are made payable out of the preceding item, 'For objects not hereinbefore named,' so. that there is no increase in the aggregate estimate. Their expenditure is also made conditional upon this Government becoming a member of the International Geodetic Association by signifying its adhesion to the Convention of said Association of October, 18861 in pgrsuance of the very urgent invitation from the German Government transmitted in February last. Inasmuch as &uch adhesion involves an obligation which can only he folfilled by th~ annual contribution aforesaid and by the triennial attendance of a delegate (who should be selected by the National Academy of Sciences), the honorable Secretary of State will prohably await an appropriation by Congress before signifying such adhesion. Without prolonging this communication by a detailed exposition of the purpose of such Association, it is believed that a sufficient argument in behalf of the small appropriation mentioned is to be found iu the urgent invitation extended by the German Government for us to unite with an Association embracing the Government of every enlightened nation of Europe, and in the earnest an<! emphatic indorsement of the purpose of such A8SOCia.tion and of Olll' adhesion thereto, by the most eminent geodesists of America and Europe.

"The estimates contemplate a reduction of four from the number of field-officers provided for They contemplate also an increase in the pay of three assistants in charge, respectively, or the Engraving, Drawing, and Instrument Divisions, which increase is but a just compensation of services, a partial re-imbursement for a reduction of former compensation by the abolishment of their subsistence allowance, and is intended to continue only while they remain, respecti>ely, in charge of the divisions mentioned. "The estimate for 'Pay of office-force' provides for $500 additional compensation to the tlisbursing clerk, Treasury Department, which was approved by the honorable Secretary of the Treasury last year (Appendix Ff, page 291, Estimates for fiscal year 1888). It pro>ides also for a few deserved promotions, aggregating $720, and for an increase, the urgency of which was mcutioued in my letter transmitting the estimates for the current year, and which has been found to be in<lispensable, in the Computing, Drawing, and Engraving Di\'isions, to the working up of data which were accumulated but unused under all tlie former Superintendents, and to the prompt (and therefore adequately useful) publication of the current results of the work in the form of charts, chart corrections, comparative surveys and hydrography, tide-tables, tidal and current data, and compilations for replies to requests from other bureaus or private individuals for information, drawings, tracings, etc. Very much of the value of the work of the Sur>ey depenus upon such prompt publication of its results, especially in the form of new cl.tarts and new edit ions of old charts, which adequately prompt publication is absolutely impossible without the requested increase in the force of computers, tidal computers, draughtsmen, and engravers. An appropriation in the form suggested-$4,500 for additional draughtsmen at not exceeding $900 per year each, $2,700 for additional computers at not exceeding $900 }lf>l' year each, and $2, 700 for additional engravers at not exceeding $900 per year each-would enable us to employ, on trial for six months, and at much less than $90() per year each, a large number of comparatively young arnl promising computers, draughtsmen, and engravers, from whom to select for retention those who demonstrate their superiority by such competition. It is a method which has heretofore been tried in the selection of incumbents for the mentioned positions, which demand the one qualification of demonstrated fitnesli'. The law making separate appropriations for llrintiug for this Bureau having been operatirn but a little more than two months, and having 110 data iudicating tlie propriety of a modificatiou, the estimates for printing (wliich, pursuant to the act making appropriation for sundry ch·il expenses for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1887, are made 'separately and in detail') ask for the same amounts which were estimated for the current year. Respectfully, yours, F. M. THOHN, Superintendent. The SECRET.A.RY OF TB.E TREASURY.

Wash·ington, October 7, 1887. SIR: Herewith I have the honor to transmit the estimates of appropriations required for the Office of Construction of Standard ·weights and Measures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1889. The only changes eontemplated by these estimates, as comJ>ared with the estimates and appropriations for the current year, consist in the substitution of annual in place of per diem or monthly salaries (involving an aggregate reduction of $67) and the omission of the words 'while actually employed' from the clause appropriating for salaries. The omitted words tend to produce an unjust discrimination against the three mentioned emploJ·es in the matter of leaves of absence aud of pay on days when the Departments are closed by Executive order. Their employment is continuous, substantially identical with that of the Coast Survey employcs, being performed side by side with them, and there is no reason for the retention of the phrase" while actually employed" in their cases, which would not also apply with equal force and propriety to any other permanent employes of the Government. Existing Jaws have provided for supplying States and Territories with standard weights and measures. No provision, however, has heretofore bef'n made for repairs and adjustments to the standards so supplie9, but which have become valueless by fire or other accident. The standards having lJeen supplied by the Office of Standard Weights and Measures, no reason is appareut why, having been injured, their value or utility should remain permanently destroyed for want of authority, at the sole repository of standards, to repair and re-adjust them. Such authority, without increased appropriation, is contemplated by the proviso attached to the item for ''Contingent Expenses." Very respectfully, F. M. THORN, Superintendent.

PART II.
The abstracts of reports of fiel<l operations which appear in this part of the Annual Report, arranged in a geographical order, include references to the localities of the work, tJie Lime of its execution, and the names of the officers engaged in it, which are essential to a complete history of tl1e progress of the Survey. A statement of office operations condensed from the annual report of the Assistant in charge of the Office (Appendix: No. 4) follows, and also a notice of the suboffices at Philadelphia and at San Francisco. Among the several branches of work begun, completed, or in progress during the year, mention may be made here of the following, which have special practical or scientific Yalue: The continuation of the special triangulation in aid of the topographical surYey of the State of Massa· chusetts; the investigations intended to ascertain the mode of formation of the slloals at the entrance to Vineyard Sound, and what means should be adopted to preserve the navigable channels into that Sound; conclusions deduced from the physical survey of New York Harbor in regard to the circulation of the sea through that harbor; redetermination of a part of the boundary line between the States of Virginia and North Carolina; hy<lrographic examination in Charleston Harbor to determine any changes that might be due to the earthquake; conclusions reached iu the progress of the investigations of the currents of the Gulf Stream; resurveys of San Diego and San Pedro Bays, and of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun Bays, California, and progress made towards a junction of the transcontinental triangulations advancing westwarcl from the Atlantic coast and eastward from the Pacific. In Appendix No. 2 is given a tabular statement of the vrogress made in field and office work during the year, as shown by statistics, and in Appendix No. 3 a list of data furnished to Departments of the Government in reply to official calls, and to individuals upon application. The assignment of Lieut. Commander W. H. Brownson, U. S. N., to duty as Ilydrographic Inspector of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was continued throughout the year. In Appendix No. 5 is puulished the annual report of this officer, in which h:s efficient discharge of important and responsible service is fully made manifest. · Beginning with a summarized statement of bydrographic work and of the condition of tile vessels of the Survey, the report refers to the work of the Coast l'ilot Division, which, under the general direction of the Hydrographic Inspector, is carried on under the immediate charge of Lieut. George H. Peters, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Surrny, who has submitted a special report of progress. Lieutenant-Commander Brownson's report concludes with a notice of the work of the Hydrographic Division of his office, which wa;; in immediate charge of Lieut. J. F. Moser, U.S. N., from the beginning of the fiscal year to November 10; tlien of Lieut. J.M. Hawley, U.S. N., until April 27, 1887, when he was relieved by lieut. M. L. Wood, U.S. N., whose report is appended. For copies of the Atlantic Local Coast Pilot there is a steady and increasing demand among sea-faring men. New editions of four of the subdivisions have been called for. Forms of questions devised to obt!\_in special information from the best local authorities with regard to ports and har. bors have been widely circulated, and with excellent results. A volume of the Coast Pilot, to include the entire Atlantic coast, is in preparation upon a plan intended to present only such details as are absolutely essential to the navigator.

It is hoped also to have read~- for publication in the course of a few months the manuscript of a new and greatly enlarged edition of the Pacific Coast Pilot, prepared by Assistant George Davidson. Lieutenant-Commander Brownson refers to the numerous and exacting duties connected with the Ilydrographic Division, consisting of the planning and preparation of projections for hydrographic work, tl1e examination and verification of hydrograpbic sheets as they come in from the field, the prepar,ition of corrections to charts, and the prompt notification to navigators of changes and corrections on charts, and of the de,·dopment of all dangers to navigation. 1\fessrs. Eugene Willenbucher, "\V. C. Willenbucher, and F. C. Donn continued on duty as h3'flrograpliic draughtsmen in this division during the fiscal year. Tabular statements of their work accompany the report. Mr. George J. Vestner remained on duty as clerk to the Hydrographic Inspector. SECTION I.

TopograpMcal surl'Cy in the vicinity of Machias, and triangulation of Cob1wook Bay, Maine.-At as early a date as practicable after the passage of the annual appropriation act, .Assistant C. H. Boyd Wfts dire~ted to organize a party for the completion of the topography in the 'Ticinity of l\faclda;;, l\le., and fOI' the triaugulation of Oo bscook Bay. Beginning work about the middle of August, he completed the Machias topographical sheet by the addition of enough topography to develop the first range of hills surrounding the town, and then took up the triangulation of Oobscook Bay, starting from the base Trescott Rock-Porcupine. Field-work in this vicinity was closed October 291 a sufficient unmber of points having been determined lly tbat time for the projections laid out to cover the south side of Oobscook Bay. Mr. Boyd tllen returned to Machias, where he was occupied in some topographical examinations until November 7, at which date field operations were finally closed. Assistant Gerslwm Bradford joined the party at the beginning of the season and rendered most acceptable service until October 24, when he was detached for duty which will be referred to under a subsequent heading in this section. A smnmary of the work accomplished is given in the following statistics: Miles of road surveyed _.... __ ..... _... - - .. - ..... - . . · . . . . . . · . . . · . . . . . . . . . · · 7 Miles of creeks .surveyed ..... - . . . . . . . . . · · . . · . · . . · · . ·.. · · · · · . . . . . . · . . . . . · · · 1 .Area surveyed in square miles .·... _.... . . · · · · · · . · · · · · . · · . · · . . . . · · · . . . . . . · 5 Number of stations occupied in triangulation................................ 14 Number of angles measured (second order) ..·..·.······ , · . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . · · 118 Number of angles measured (third order) ... _.. _..··.·.·....... _......... · . 96 Geographical positions determined ......... _ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . 26 During the wiuter and until near the end of April, 1887, Mr. Bo~-cl was occupied in office duty, an<l upon bis detachment, from the office was instructed to continue the triangulation of Cobscook Bay.

Hydrographic 81tr'l'!ey of the Saint Croix River begun, and hydrographic exa,minations made in the Penobscot River, Maine.-Under instructions bearing date of May 16, 1887, Lieut.'F. H. Crosby, U.S. N. 1 Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, left New York with bis party on board the steamer Gedtwy, and proceeding to the coaat of Maine took up some bydrographic examinations required in the Penobscot. River from Sears Island to Adams Ledge.

Lieutenant Crosby reports that lte was unable to find au eighteen-feet spot which hail been reported to the southward of Fort Point Ledge, and the local authorities whom he cousulted doubted its existence. In the vicinity of Adams Ledge he found the riw,r bottom \·ery much changed, and was informed by pilots and fishermen that the changes 11igher up the riwr since the former survey are greater. Enough soundings were taken to show folly the changes iu the locality of the Ledge. Just above Sandy Point, and about half a mile from shore, Lieutenant Cmshy developed a rocky ledge to which his attention was called by local pilots, who Heemed to be unanimous in tlw opinion that a buoy should be placed there. The Penobscot River work was finished .Tmw Li, :irn1 on June 30 the Gedney was at Eastport, where the survey of the Saint Croix River was begun in the steam launch Saga.dalwc. Further account of the progress of this work will appear in the next annual report. 11Jdrographic examinations made and additional soundings taken in Long I:slaud Sound <Lt the outset of the season by faeutenant Crosby arc referred to under the beading of Section II.

Additional progress in field operations will be referred to in the next annual report. Hydrographic survey of the coast of Maine from Machias Bay Entrance to Quoddy Head, and hydrographic examinations on the coasts of 1lfaine and Massachusetts.-Reference was made in the last annual report to the organization of a hydrogra.phic party by Lieut. John M. Hawley, U.S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, commanding the steamer Baclw, and to examinations made by him under - instructions in Casco Passage and York Narrows, coast of Maine, while on his way with the Bache

to a field of work further to the eastward. The results of these examinations were presented in a special report in which Lieutenant Hawley recommended that Casco Passage tihould be buoyed, it being quite as wide as York Narrows, and straighter, while the least water found was three fatlwms. These examinations were made June 28, 29, and 30, 1886, and since then Casco Passage has been buoyed, five buoys having been placed to mark the ledges on either side of the channel. In Tork Narrows a new ledge was developed to the westward of Hawley's Ledge; ranges for finding Hawley's Ledge were reported, and also bearings for the new ledge, which has but ten and a half feet on its shoalest part at mean low water. Upon the completion of this work, Lieutenant Hawley proceeded directly to Machiasport, .Me., and after putting in a new boiler into the launch Sagadahoc, which bad been laid up at that port, took up the regular work of the season, a hydrographic survey of the coast of Maine and included harbors from Libby Island to Quoddy Head, and off-shore soundings between the same limits to within three miles of th13 British possessions. For the inshore hydrography, four projections were furnished by the Office on a scale of 1-10000, the first including Machias Bay Entrance; the second, Little Machias Bay and to the eastward; the third to the eastward of Little River, and the fourth to the eastward of Bailey's Mistake. A fifth projection, scale 1-40000, was supplied for the ltydrograpby of Grand l\fanan Channel. All soundings on the hydrographic sheet which included :Machias Bay Entrance with Cross Island Narrows were reduced from observations of the tide made at Starboard Creek on a gauge put up there by Lieutenant, Heald in 1885. On the second, third, and fifth projections the soundings were reduced to a lllane of reference found by continuous obser""atious of low water for one month and observations at intervals for two months on a gauge established August 3, at Cutter, Washington County: Me. The soundings on the fourth hydrographic sheet, Bailey's Mistake to Qnoddy Head, were reducc<l from observations of the tide made at Carrying Place Cove, West Quoddy Head, and the plane of reference was found by transferring the mean low water of the gauge at Cutter. Lieutenant Hawley reports the weather during the season as unusually favorable, there beiug but little fog and no gales. As heretofore he took every opportunity to obtain information re.specting shoals and ledges from fishermen and pilots in the vicinity, and made a large number of soundings for the development of shoals. For the survey of Little River, Jines were run closer than usual, it being a harbor of refuge much used by coasters in bad or foggy weather. Upon the completion of the regular work of the season, October 6, the steam-launch was laid up at Eastport, and Lieutenant Hawley proceeded in the Bache to New York, stopping en route to make special examinations and surveys at the following-named localiti~s: (1) Examination of a ledge in Moos-a-bee Reach, Maine, upon which the least water was found to !Je seven and a half feet instead of twelve feet as shown on the charts. (2) Additional soundings needed to locate all the curves of depth, and clear up doubtful spott in Pleasant l{,frer above Reef Point. (3) Examination of Tibbett's Rock and Jackson Ledge, lying to the emstwanl of Petit Manan Light-house for least depths of water, and to fix ranges for finding these ledges. (4) Arleitional soundings at entrance of Southwest Harbor, Mount Desert Island, between Cran. berry Ledge and Flynn's Ledge. (5) Search for a shoal spot of three fathoms to the southward and eastward of Boon Island Light. The result of a careful search convinced Lieutenant Hawley that no shoal existed as reported. These examinations finished, the Bache proceeded, towards the end of October, to Edgartown Harbor. Massachusetts, instructions having been given to her commander to execute work in that vicinity. Reference to this will be made under a later heading in this section. The officers attached to the party during the season were Ensigns Edward E. Wright, John E. Cra.ven, H.euben 0. Bitler, and Harry .A. Field, U. S. N. Of their efficiency and zeal in the performance of all duty intrusted to them Lieutenant Hawley speaks in high terws.

. Series of tidal observations with automatic tide-gauge continued at Pulpit Cove, North Raven
Island, Penobscot Bay, Maine.-The record from the automatic tide-gauge which was established iu 1870 nt Pulpit Cove, North Haven Island, Penobscot Bay, was kept up throughout the year by tlte ob8erver, Mr. J. G. Spauluing. During the prevalence of low temperatures iu the winter, the water in the float tube is heated l.Jy an apparatus devisecl for the purpose, and no interruption is allowed to occur in the record, which is for the past year almost alJsolutely unbroken. It will lJe . very desirable to continue the observations at this station until a lmrnr cycle shall have been completed. Oo-operation with the Commission for the Topographical Survey of the State of JJiassaohusetts.Reference is made under this and other headings in this section to the service of Assistant Heury L. Whiting as one of the Commissioners of the Topographical Survey of the State of Massachusetts, under special assignment, with the approval of the Secretars of the Treasury. For the first seven weeks of the fiscal year Mr. Whiting was engaged in completing a resurvey of Cotamy Beach, Martha's Vineyard, mention of which is maue unde1' a separate heauing. On October I, 1886, he reported for duty at the Coast aml Geodetic Survey Office in pursuance of instructions. During the winter he made tbree visits to .Massachusetb; on tbe senice of the State Commission, and while there prepareu plans showing the exterior lines in ti<le-water of the State. Reference in detail to these plans is made under a separate hcadiug. In the execution of his duties at the Office of the Survey, in addition to minor subjects reforred to him for examination, Mr. Whiting prepared a project, illustrated by maps and diagrams, for a. new series of charts for Long Island Sound; a project for a series of field topographical sheets of the coast of Maine and so much of the territory of the British Provinces as would include the approaches to our own waters, and also a project with maps and tliagrams for a series of fiehl topographical sheets for the resurvey of Nantucket and Vineyard Sounus. On April 1, 1887, he left the Office, under instructions to make arrangements for the field operations of the triangulation parties of Assistant Bradford and Subassistant Van Onlen, who Lad been assigned to the duty of furnishing points for the State survey of :Massachusetts and for the determination of the boundary lines of cities and towns in the State under his general supervision . .Mr. "\Vhiting has included a brief notice of Mr. Bradford's work in his own report, but as a more detailed report has been made by Mr. Bradford, an abstract of this is given under a separate headiug. The locality of his work was at Wareham, Mass. Mr. Van Orden reported for duty April 26, and established his headquarter.;; at Provincetown. The field assigned to him was the peninsula. Cape Cod. The cl1aracter of the country is fairly open and accessible. Up to June 30, 1887, the statistics of his work are:

In addition to the triangulation, Mr. Van Orden ran a line of geodesic leveling through 11art of the area of his work, beginning at Wellfleet and running south and west. The length of this line up to June 30 was eleven miles. During the closing months of the fiscal year, Mr. Whiting supervised the field-work just referred to; completed the plans showing the external lines in tide-water aml the l.Jountlary lines between cities and towns in the State bordering on the sea, and made preliminary arrangements for beginning the topographical resurvey of the shores of Vineyard and Nantucket Sounds.

copies of the official plans of the Harbor and Land Commission, which were prepared by him by authority of the Commission. These plans show the exterior line in tide-water of the State, and the boundary lines in tide-water of cities and towns bordering on the sea, and on arms of the sea from the shore-line out to the exterior line, which, as defined by statute, extends one marine league from the sea-shore at low-water mark. This marine league is taken as equal in length to three nautical miles, or 5,559.6 meters. Mr. Whiting has already prepared, with the approval of the Superintendent, plans showing the lines referred to in Bristol, Dukes, Nantucket, and parts of Barnstable and Plymouth Counties. The main plan is composed of selected sheets of the three coast charts, on the scale of 1-80000, extending from Monomoy to Block Island, joined and backed so as to form a continuous slieet, showing thereon the territorial limits of the Commonwealth as defined by the statute just referred to, and giving the geographical positions of the initial points marking the angles and intersections of the town boundary lines in tide-water. This plan, Mr. Whiting observes, is preliminary in its character, for while it establishes these points with sufficient accuracy for illustration and practical purposes of definition, yet when the work of determining by triangulation the boundary lines of cities aml towns of the State on land has been completell, the Commissioners intend to restate the 1iositions of the points, and to redescribe the lines of exterior and subdivisional jurisdiction, so that the geographical position of each point in these lines shall conform to the system of final adjustment of all the other points in Massachusetts based on the Clarke spheroid. Two subplans have also been prepared, one on the harbor chart of Wood's Holl, on a scale of 1-20000, showing on this larger scale the more intricate boundary line between Falmouth and Gosnold, and one on a manuscript tracing from original topographical sheets, on a scale of 1-10000, of the still more intricate boundary line in the headwaters of Buzzard's Bay, between the towns of Wareham and Sandwich. Disputed questions of fishing rights and the previously undefined jurisdiction over the valuable oyster beds in these waters gave rise to the State legislation which determined the bouudaries and defined the jurisdiction in tide-water of each town, respectively. To the main plan, and to each subplan, have been attached printed copies of the reports of the Harbor and Land,Oommissioners of "Massachusetts, under whose authority this work was done, giving all neededjnformation in regard to these town boundaries. The value of such plans, based on accurate surveys and delineated on trustworthy charts, is manifest. Already in Massachusetts these determined boundaries have led to the settlement of questions of conflicting jurisdiction relating to fishing interests. They also define judicial jurisdiction in cases of crime committed on the water. At tl1e request of the Harbor and Land Commissioners of Massachusetts, Mr. Whiting has transmitted to this Office a plan of part of Boston Harbor, specially prepared by that Eoar«l for the use of the Survey, showing improvements made in its channels by the United States and by the State. This plan accompanies the report of the Commissioners for 1883, and has been cerrected by them to show the condition of the channels on January 1, 1887. Triangulation in aid of the topographical surrey of the State of Massacltusetts.-For the determination of points for the use of the topographical survey of the State of Massachusetts, ..Assistant Gershom Bradford was directed towards the end of October, 188G, to report to ..Assistant H. I,. ·whiting, one of the Commissioners of that survey, by special assignment of the Superintendent at the request of the Governor of the State. After consultation with Mr. Whiting, Mr. Bradford proceeded to Plymouth, Mass., and having recovered the old stations, Monk's Hill and Manomet, started his triangulation with this line as a liase, and continued it over the townships of Plymouth, Carver, Plympton, and Kingston, an area of about one hundred and fifty square miles, until December 4, when a heavy snow storm set in, which made the further pr-0secution of the work inadvisable.

After returning from the field, l\fr. Bradford was engaged in completing the records and com· putations of his work. Two copies were required, one for the State of Massachusetts, which was transmitted to Mr. Whiting, and one for the archives of the Survey. In January Mr. Bradford was directed to report to the Assistant in charge of the Office, and was assigned to the division of physical hydrography under the direction of Assistant Henry .Mitchell. Upon being detached frolll the Office at the end of March he proceeded under instructions to Boston, where he reported to Assistant H. L. Whiting for triangulation work in aid of the survey of the State of Massaclmsetts. Reference was made in the last annual report to that branch of the work in Massachusetts which involved the determination by triangulation of the boundary lines of cities and towns in th1· Commonwealth, and to its progress under Mr. Whiting's general direction. At his instance Mr. Brailford took up this work in the town of Wareham, at the head of Buzzard's Bay, April 21, 1887, all(l was still engage1l in it at the close of the fiscal year. The location of the boundary marks definillg the angles in the several town lines presented obstacles only to be overcome by special devices. Not unfrequently the marks were found in remote and almost inaccessible places, sometimes in low land and in the dense forest. The country about Wareham offers few commanding heigh ts for observation, and fewer still that are free from obstructing woods. High tripod and scaffold Rignals were impracticable on account of the great expense attending their erection; heuce church steeples and other artificial elevations were used as much as possible, and flags placed in trees near the boundary stones, carefully·checked compass bearings and distances being taken from the flag-poles or fiteeples to the stones. By June 30, 1887, the northwestern corner of Wareham had been partially triangulated; also the western side of \Y a.rebam and the western side of Marion township. Mr. Bradford reports the following statistics: Stations recovered . - ....···.··....... - _- - . · · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . · . · · 7 Stations occupied for horizontal direction observations . . . . . . . · · . . . . . . . . . . . . · . 25 Stations occupied, for (}bservation of elevations ........·.·..···.......... _. . . 11 Horiz(}ntal directions observed ·.·....... _....... _....... _. _. __ ........ _.... 142 V.ertical aqgles observed - . - ...... _..... _. _. _...... _. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 68 Boundary stones located ....................·........ - .. _.. _.......... _. . . . 11 Resurvey of tlie slwre-line of Cape Cod peninsula, between Nausett and Mono11wy.-Adtlitioual resnrveys being required to obtain data for the study of the changes of shore-line on the :Massachusetts coast between Nausett and Monomoy, Assistant John B. Weir was instructed, towartls the close of August, 1886, to proceed to Chatham, Mass., and make a topographical resurvey from Nausett to connect with the resurvey made in June preceding by Assistants Boyd and Van Orden in the vicinity of Mouomoy. The work: being intended to be done in connection with studies in pltysical hydrography under the direction of Assistant Henry Mitchell, Mr. Weir was directed to confer with Mr. Mitchell in regard to details of execution, and after these officers had gone together over a large IJart of the ground the survey was begun early in September. The plan adopted for the work required a determination of shore-line, both high and low water, from Nausett to a point about a mile and a half north of Monomo.r Point Ligl1t, and a representa.tion of the bluff.line wherever clear definition could be obtained. In addition to this, lines of levels along the base and crest-line of the bluffs, and offsets a short distance back from the cre~t over territory likely to cave in, were required. Two title-gauges were desired for refereuce, oue witbin Harding's Beach and one ou the outside of the beach in front of Chatham. These gauges were to be observed. so as to compare high and low water at their respective localities. The topographical work was assigned to Mr. G. F. Bird, Aid, who reported for duty Septemoor 2, and carried 011t in detail Assistant Mitchell's suggestions. The points needed for the topog· raphy were determined by Mr. Weir, who obtained also the tide.gauge comparisons, and ra.n lines of levels along the crest-line and base of the bluffs, establishing temporary bench.marks from fifty to two hundred meters apart. The positions of these temporary marks were determined by the plane-table and plotted on the topographical sheet. Angles of elevation were taken every ten or twenty meters, or as oftea as was necessary to delineate the profile of the bluffs. Otrsets were rlln back from the crest of the blll1l's to furnish data to compute the areas which might, in future,

26

be washed away, and lines of levels were run at a number of points down the face of the bluffs to determine the angles of natural slope. Five permanent bench-marks were established and connected with the levels, the plane of reference for which was mea.n low water of the gauge outside of the main beach in front of Chatham. This plane of reference was secured by a permanent bench-mark on Chatham North Light. Field operations were closed November 11, after which Mr. Weir was instructed to proceed to Washington, and subsequently to organize a party for geodesic leveling in Alabama and Mississippi. Mention of this duty will be further made under the heading of Section VIII. Following are the statistics reported of work on the coast of Massachusetts: Number of stations occupied in triangulation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 Number of miles of shore-line surveyed..... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 144 Mr. Weir commends highly the energy and skill of his aid, Mr. Bird. Physical hydro.qraphy.-Movements of the su,nds at the entrance to Vineyard Sound.-In a-dditi-0n to other researches in physica} hydrography, the study of the changes in Monomoy and its shoals was continued during the year by Assistant Henry Mitchell. In Appendix No. 8 to the last annual report, Mr. l\Iitcbell gave the physical history of those changes; in Appendix No. 6 to this volume he submits a continuation of that paper, in which he discusses the movement of the sands at the entrance to Vineyard Sound, and presents tables showing the resultant effect of tidal currents in that locality, Mr. Mitchell prefers the title "Entrance to Vineyard Sound," because, as he states, the title "Nantucket Sound" (first given by Lieut. Charles Henry Davis) has never been adopted by the commercial world, and because the theme of his discussion involves the entire water space sheltered by the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, and he adopts, therefore, the name in use that is the most comprehensive. In a paper which forms part of his annual report, Mr:Mitcbell offers some notes on physical surveys in progress, and maintains that the seaward approaches to great cities, and the sounds through which the fleets of commerce must pass, can never cease to be fields of survey; they must be watched as carefully as the great railways or rivers of interior communication. Recommendations made by him in this paper for a survey of the seaward face of that portion of the Cape Cod peninsula from which shoal-building material appears to be derived, and for a hytlrographic survey off Chatl1am and to the southward, have been carried into effect. Other recommendations relating to the physical survey of New York Bay and Harbor will be referred to, with a notice of the J)rogress of that survey, under tbe heading of Section II. Special hydrography on the coast of Massachusetts from Powder Hole, Monomoy, to a point northward of Chatham Rfoer.-ln connection with the study of the movements of the sands at the eastern entrance to Vineyard Sound, to which much time has been given by Assistant Henry Mitchell, and in accordance with suggestions made by him, instructions were given at the close of August, 1886, to I1ieut. J.E. Pillsbury, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geotletic Survey, commanding the steamer Blake, to make special examinations on the Massachuset.ts coast from a point off Chatham towards l\fouomoy. This survey was begun Sept.ember 22. Lines of sounding normal to the shore were run at distances varying from two hundred and sixty to six hundred feet, with cross-lines at distances apart of from four hundred to six hundred feet. These normals were mostly run on ranges placed by the party. While the boats were engaged in sounding, Lieutenant Pillsbury anchored the vessel at a number of stations and observed currents with the Pillsbury current-meter. He desired t,o ascertain whether there were any subcurrents setting contrary to the surface currents which wonl1l account for the difference in time exiRting between high water and the tlood current, or low water and the ebb, which is about three hours. These observations were taken between Handkerchief and Shovelful Shoals, and in the deep water of Butler's Hole, but the subcurrents were always found to be setting nearly true with those at the surface and with about the same velooity. The shoal on the Shovelful was observed to make great changes during the progress of tLe work, extending or reducing its length, changing its direction, and alt.erillg its profile continually. .At this point the sea seems to meet fu:5m opposite directions. Sometimes the top of the shoal would

he flat and at other times curved. At :first it was nearly a regular curve in contour, and then the eastern end became bifurcated. Monomoy Point was observed to make great changes in a westerly gale. The sand was washed np, apparently building the Point towards the southward and eastward to an elevation of four or five feet at high-water mark and about two feet at low water. Assistant Mitchell, in a note to this, observes that sometimes the elevation changes eleven feet, but that there is no permanent change due to storms in the long run. Lieutenant Pillsbury presents the following statistics of the survey, which was compieted November8:

J. Maxwell, U. S. N., attached to the Coast and Geodetic Survey, visited a number of localities upon the New England coast and in New York to make examinations for the use of the Coast Pilot with regard to impro·ements in harbors, quarantine regulations, bridges, uncharted dangers, buoys, new shore· lines, and weather signals. The terminal points of the Uape Cod Ship Canal, now in course of construction, were visited and notes made of such information as would be useful. At Boston and New Bedford M1'. l\iax. well tested sailing lin~s and ranges for mitering and leaving these ports. This he was accorded facilities for doing by the courtesy of the Harbor-master of Boston and the Collector of the Port at New Bedford. ·while at Boston he visited the office of the State Harbor Commissioners, and there obtained the results of the latest harbor improvements in that port. These ha\ e since been transferred to the charts of the Survey. Other ports at which examinations were made were Monument, Sandwich, and Fall River, Mass. ; Wickford, Newport, Providence, Warren, and Bristol, R. I.; and New York, N. Y. Routes by water were selected, whenever possible, in order to obtain such information as could be given by captains of steamers, and to make notes on the courses followed. Mr. Maxwell completed his examinations and returned to Washington December 28. Completion of a topographical survey of a new opening in Ootamy Beach, forming an inlet into Edgartown Harbor, Martlia's Vineyard.-The duty of determining the exact location, extent, a111l character of the opening made in Cotamy Beach by the storm of January 9, 1886, having been assigned to Assistant Henry L. Whiting, as stated in the last annual report, he took up the work with as little delay as practicable, and in September, 1886, submitte,d a full report of its results, with special reference to the changes which had occurred at different periods since the first surreys were made forty years ago. This paper was accompanied by a map showing changes in Cotamy Beach from surveys made by Mr. Whiting in 1846, 1856, 1871, and 1886, and was published as Appendix No. 9 to the last annual report. The opening of 1846 was similar in position and extent to that shown by Des Barres in 1776. The easterly point of the present opening is farther within the Bay, north ward, than at any previous ti.me, and, contrary to the usual action of the inlets and openings of previous years, the resultants of its moving sands have had a westwanl movement. The movement in tllis direction Mr. Whiting thinks will probably prove to be bnt a temporary one, and eventually the opening will work eastward as all former ones have done, though certain conditions of the beach may retard it. Soon after the opening was made, its width by estimation was three hundred feet; on July 1, by actual survey, it was twelve hundred feet. Upon application made by the Board of Harbor and Land Commissioners of the St.ate of Massachusetts, a copy of Mr. Whiting's report was furnished for the U!'le of the board. Hydrographic examinations in Edgar'town Harbor and approach.es.-In a<.,~ordance with instruc· tions issued in October, 1886, Lieut. John M. Hawley, U. S. N .· A.ssistant Coast Survey, corn man ding the steamer Bache, on his way from duty on the coast of Maine, made an examination of the channel

into Edgartown Harbor and of the new inlet into Ootamy Bay, taking also current obser1ntions in mid clmnnel between Chappaquiddick Point and Edgartown. Arrh'ing at Edgartown November 5, Lieutenant Hawley put up a tide-gauge on the wharf near where the old gauge had stood, and reduced bis soun<liugs to the plane of reference fnrnisht>11 hs the Office from former ouservations. Several channel lines of sonudings were run through the iulet at Cotamy Hay, and the line of breakers located on each side of the channel. Fishermen familiar with the locality stated that the channel through the inlet changed in direction an<l dPpth with every strong gale, and gave it as their opinion that the inlet was likely to close up at any time. LineR of soundings about fifty meters apart were run across the channel into Edgartown from the outside red buoy to a point nearly a mile south of tlie town, a suflicieIJt number being takeu to denilop an;y changes that might have taken place in the channel. Coutinuous observations of the tidal current were taken for twenty-eight consecutive hours, and would have been kept up longer but for a heavy gale. Ensigns E. E. Wright, John E. Craven, R. 0. Bitler, and H. A. Field, U. S. N., aided in the work. The statistics arc:

This duty performed, Lieutenant Hawley proceeded in the Bache to New York, wl1ere be arrived November 10. Soon after he was assigned to service in the office of the Hydrograpltic Inspector. Completion of the topographical resurvey of Block Island, Rhode Island.-Refe.rence was made in the Jast annual report to the progress of the topographical resurvey of Block Island, this resurvey being required as a part of the general resurvP.y of Long Island Sound, with the islandR included in it and adja-0ent to it. Assistant W. H. Dennis, to whom bad been assigucu the charge of this work, ha<l finished upwards of half of it by the beginning of the fiscal year, and completed it on the 9th of August, 1886· .Mr. Dennis has incorporated in bis report some statements of much interest respecting tbe topogra1)hical and geological fe.atnres of the iRland, extracts from which are as follows: "The work on Block Island W<lS of such a character as to require a very minute Rlu\·e~' to represent properly its peculiar features; the 1mrface is very irregular, or billowy, the highest point being some two lrnndre<l awl twelre feet ahoYc tide-water. "It is very nearly divided b_y Great Salt Pond, the pond being separated on the east and west sides from the ocean by narrow strips of sand. Tbe northern part of the island, known as t11e Neck, is on the western side mostly sand and sand dunes, while the eastern is highly culti\"ated land; its highest point is about one hundred and forty feet; the bluffs along this part of the Ncek, known ru;; Clay Head, are from twenty to one hundred and fifteen feet above tide. "The southern part of the island is nearly all under cultivation. Un the eastern side, \Vhich is the most thickly settle1l, are the artificial harbor and breakwater built by the Government, :uul most of the large summer hotels. The eastern and southern shores of the island are steep bluff:'!, in places one hundred and seventy feet high. At the feet of these is a narrow sand a11<l cohble beach, with large bowhlers scattered profusely along, which serve as a breakwater, preventing the wash of the blnffis li:y the sea. "Dotted over the whole island are innumerable ponds of all sizes and shapes, the water,i of which are from a few feet to upwards of one hundred feet above tide. There is no evidence of these ponds being supplied by springs; they are simply catch-basins, which, from the nature of the soil, hold the water. "The surface soil is of granitic origin; no rooks are found in place, but numerous bo,,l<lers of granit~ are scattered over the island. The substratum on which the whole rests is a cfppcsit of Tertiary blue clay, destitute of any remains of marine shells, and containing layers of white sand. a.nu imbedded masses of gravelly bog-iron ore."

After finishing the resurvey of Block Island, Mr. Dennis took up, under instructions, the fill. ing in of a gap in topography on the coast of Rhode Island, from Watch Hill, about fiye miles t-0 the eastward, and extending inland between three aml a half and four and a quarter miles, to a little beyond the line of the Providence and Stonington Railroad. Upon the completion of this surrny, OctolJer 31, field operations were closed for the season, and Mr. Dennis was ordered to duty at the Offiee. During tlie winter he '1as occupied for the greater part of the time in inking his topogrnphical sheet of Block Island in such a manner that it could be reproduced by IJhotolithograph,r. Between December 13 and January 2 he was placed in charge of the Instrument Division during the temporary absence of its chief. Having finished the inking of the Block Island sheet the last of l\Iarch, Mr. Dennis soon after received instructions to complete some unfinished portions of topography on or near the north coast of Long Island Sound. Mention of this sen·ice will be made under the heading of Section II, where also will be given the statistics of field-work executed by him during the fiscal year. SECTION II.

'Triangulation at the eastern end of Long Island Sound.-In continuation of the resurvey of I~ong Island Sound, certain additional triangulation was found t-0 be needed between S,tybrooJ,, Coun., and Watch Hill, H. I. For the execution of this work instructions were issuPd towardi,; the end of August, 1886, to Subassistant 0. H. Van Orden, who t-Ook the field on the 24th of that mouth, and at once began a general reconnaissance of the coast for the recovery of old points and the lJnildiug of signals. The points determined are included in a stretch of coast on the Connecticut shore of the Hound from the Connecticut River eastwardly, and extend a short distance into Rhode Island. Observations were begun September 11, and, the weather being unusually favoral.Jle, were finished October 5. Mr. Van Orden reports the following statistics:

Towards the end of March, 18871 be received instructions to proceed to Boston, Mass., and report to Assistant Whiting for duty in aid of the t-Opographical survey of the State of l\Iassacbusetts. Mention of this service will be found undr the heading of Section I. Topographical resurvey of the north shore of Long Island Sound between Stonington and Pequonrwck, Oonn.-In accordance with instructions dated July 28, 1886, Subassistant W. C. Hodgkins organized his party early in the following month to continue the topographical resurvey of the north l'.lhore of Long Island Sound. The work of the season, which began August 9, consisted in a survey of the country lying back from the shore between Stouington and Pequonnock, Conn., to include the principal country roads along and near the shore, and as far in the interior as the line · of the New Haven, New London and Stonington Railroad. The area surveyed, Mr. Hodgkins observes, is q.uite well s!'ttled, and includes the consideral.Jle villages of Mystic River and Mystic Bridge. The village of Noank and the borough of Stonington had been previously surveyed in connection with the survey of the shore-line in 1882 and 1883. The surface rises nowhere to a great height, but is rugged and l.Jroken, and quite well wooded a little back from the coast. . At the close of the season the new Light-house on· La.timer's l\,eef was determined by tri·

angulation.

After a term of duty at the Office, Mr. Hodgkins was instructed in January, 1887, to join the party of Assistant F. ~V. Perkins for service on the coast of Louisiana. His work in that locality will be referred to under the heading of Section VIII. Hydrographic examinations and obser·vations of currents in Long Island Sound.-Heut. 0. P. Perkins, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the schooner Eagre, reports that the work of his party executed prior to June 30, 1887, under instructions dated in l\Iarch of that year, consisted of hydrographic re-examinations off Lawrence Point, in Oyster Bay, oft' Eaton's N eek, and off Larchmont and Mamaroneck, Long Island Sound, and also of the occupation of seven stations for a full series of observations of currents at each station.

Hydrograpltic resurvey of Long Island Sound from, Faulkner's Island to Execution Rocks.-Tbe lines of soundings referred to in the last annual report, as needed to fill up parts of the surveys made in Loug Island Sound in 1884 between Hammonasset Point and New Haven, which had been unavoidably left incomplete, were finished before the middle of Jul~·, 1886, by Lieut. F. H. Urosby, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, commanding the steamer Gedney. Lieutenant Crosby then took up, under instructions dated in Jnne, 1886, the regular work of the season, which was laid out on four projections as follows: The first from Faulkner's Island to Stratford Shoal, scale 1-400-00, for steamer work in the Sound, and for boat work along the north shore of Long Island from Roanoke Point to Mount J\Iisery; the second, a projection, scale 1-40000, for steamer work to connect with the work of Lieutenant Paine in-1885, with that by J,ieutenant Crosby 011 the north, and with that by the party in the steamer Arago on the south side of the Sound; and the third a projection, scale 1-20000, from Eaton's Neck to Execution Rocks for sim. ilar work, connecting with that done by the parties in the Palinurus and Arago, and including boat work along the Long Island shore from Oak N eek to a little west of Matinicock Point. There was also one projection, scale 1-10-000, covering Port Jefferson and Stony Brook Harbors and the adjacent coast. To obtain a plane of reference for the soundings on the two sheets first named, Lieutenant Crosby erected a box gauge at Stratford Shoal Light, and kept up tidal observations there for about four months. Simultaneously with it, at different times, tides were observed on gauges at Southwest Ledge, entrance to New Haven Harbor, Money Island, Faulkner's Island, Port Jefferson (entrance and head of harbor), Stony Brook Harbor, and Stamford Light. Other gauges were established at Setauket Harbor, Wilson's Point in Sheffield Island Harbor, Constable I'oint, and Execution Rocks. Lieutenant Crosby observes that there is a gradual increase of rise and fall in the tide from east to west in the Sound until its narrow point is reached at Eaton's Neck, beyond which point there is little change. Just before the cJose of the season three current stations were occupied, one west of Execution Rocks, one off Matinicock Point, and one off Eaton's Neck. At the first-named station a full series of current observations was taken for twenty-six hours under favorable circumstaoces; at the second sta.~ion for but twenty hours, during thirteen of which the conditions were favorable;

at the third statio! a twenty-six hour series was obtained, but under conditions which were not wholly favorable. A.11 of the observations on these three stations have been sent to the Office. Sailing directions prepared by Lieutenant Crosby for those parts of the Sound included within the limits of his survey have been referred to Lieutenant Peters in charge of the Coast Pilot work. In the course of the work a rocky shoal of consi<lerable extent was <leveloped, ha\·ing a least depth of fourteen feet over it, and lying al>out three·quarters of a mile to the northeastward of Stratford Shoal Light-house. Several other shoal patches and rocky Leads were found off that Light-house, at distances varying from one· half to three-quarters of a mile, and having from sixteen to twenty-one feet of wat;er over them.· To warn navigators of these dangen~, a Notice to "Mariners (No. 80) bearing date of October 23, 18861 was issued. Vessels passing t-0 the northward of Stratford Shoal were advised to give the light house a l>ertll of at least a mile. Ensigns A.. W. Dodd, J. S. Watters, G. W. Street, U. E. Sweeting and C. l'I. Fahs, U.S. N., were attached to the Gedney during the season. Lieutenant Crosby reports the following statistics of his work, which was brought to a close about the middle of November: Miles run in sounding .................................... - ...... - ... - - . . 1, 655 Angles measured. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12, 456 Number of soundings .......................................... - - ....... 58, 223 During the winter and until about April 1 the steamer was undergoing repairs at Baltimore and at the navy-yard, New York. Early in April Lieutenant Crosby reorganized his party, under instructions, alloard the Gedney, and proceeded to Long Island Sound to make certain examina· tions and run additional Jines of soundings in Five Mile River; near Stamford, Conn.; off Stratford Point, and off Guilford, Conn. This done, he left the Sound, and under instructions bearing date of ~fay 12, made an examination in the Swash Channel, off Dry Roruer Beacon, New York Lower Bay, to locate the spot where the steamer Fulda grounded. Upon the completion of this duty, Lieutenant Crosby left New York May 30, and proceeded to the coast of Maine, to take up the regular work of the season. Reference to bis service on that coast is made under the heading of Section I. For the bydrograpby executed at tbe outset of the season, the following are the statistics reported: Miles run in sounding .......................·... , . . . . . . . . . . . . . · · . . . · . . . · · 121 Angles measured ................................·......·....... , . . . . . . . . 1, 784 Number of soundings ........................·............................ !l, 623 · Ensigns A.

Topographical resurveys on or near the north shore of Long Island Sound, to complete resur1'e!Js previously made.-In order to fill certain gaps in topographical resurveys on or near the north shore of Long Island Sound, Assistant W. H. Dennis organized his party under instructions on tlie 1st of May, 1887, taking up the topography near Stonington where he had left off the preceding season, and working westwa.rdly until on May 19 he had made a junction with the to1)ography executed by Subassistant Hodgkins. He then moved to New London and extended the topography back from the narrow margin along the shore already surveyed so as to include the line of the New Haven, New London and Stonington Railroad on hoth the Niantic and New London sheets. Finishing this on June 16, the party was transferred to Saybrook, Conn., where a similar piece of work was done, covering a small area, and again moved June 22 to Clinton, Conn., where on the 30th m\S finished all that was required on the Guilford sheet.

Detailed topographical res1m 1ey of the north shore of Long Island Sound, frolff, East B,.idgeport, Conn., to the eastward.-A shore-line reimrvey of the north coast of Long Island Sound from East Bridgeport to vVoodmont, Conn., was completed in 1884-'85 by the party in charge of Subassistant W. C. Hodgkins. In order to fill in the details of the belt of topography extending back from the shore to the line of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, Assistant W. I. Vinal was instructed to organize a party early in August, 1886. This resurvey was carried on till November 20, when field operations were closed. After inking his topographical sheet, Mr. Vinal reported for duty at the Office in Washington, where he was occupied until the end of March. In April lie was engaged in service at Baltimore, Md., which is reported under the beading of Section III, and on May 1, 1887, he resumed his topographical work in Connecticut from the limits of the previous season and brought it to completion by the end of the fiscal year. "\Vith regard to the geological features of the country covered by the survey between East Bri<lgeport and West Haven, Conn., Mr. Vinal observes that they are neither bold nor striking. Tile rocks are mostly of secondary formation and sedimentary, with many drift bowlders. Lime:stone abounds, and slate rock suitable for flagging and foundations occurs extensively. In the casteru part of Milford township is a quarry, now neg~ected, of marble, which is susceptible of high polish. The Naugatuck Railroad, which runs along the east side of the Housatonic River, passes tllrou~h an extensive cutting of micaceous gneiss rock immediately on leaving the brirlge. The streams shown on this survey are all shallow. Light-draught steamers and canal-boats pass the bridges on the Hont:atonic River, but nothing larger than a sail-boat c>tn reacl.1 Milford 011 tue Wepowagc River. At the latter place the Government has constructed a short breakwater out from Indian Point towards Charles Island. It does not appear, as 1\lr. Vinal remarks, to have beue!iteil the channel, but affords a convenient and safe anchorage below the town for small vessels. l\fr. Vinal's report refers to a number of facts of historical interest relating to the towns and vilJagcs included in his survey, mentioning among others the Indian name of Milford, which was Wepowage, a name yet retained by the little river which runs through the center of the town. It may be l)bserved llere that the name is sometimes spelled Wepawang.

Topographical resurvey of the sh1Jre-line of New York Bay, Newark Bay, Kill van Kull, and Arthur Kill.-Topographical resurvey from Woodnwnt to the eastward.-Mr. E. L. Taney, Aid, bas made a rnry brief report of the operations of his party, organized under instructions dated in August, 1886, for a topographical resurvey of part of the shore-line of New York Bay, and of the shore-lines of Newark Bay, Kill van Kull, and Arthur Kill. This resurvey was begun August 16 and finished November 15, when field-work cJosed. From that date till March 31, 1887, Mr. Taney was employed on office-work, first in inking his topographical sheets and then on duty in the Coast Pilot Division. Upon being relieved from the Office, he was ordered to service in the harbor of Baltimore, mention of which is made under the heacling of Section III. On May 1 he proceeded under instructions to West Haven, Conn., and took up a topographical resurvey from W oodmout to the eastward.

Hydrographic examinations for the Atlantic Coast PUot in Long Island Sound and on the coast to the eastward.-For the pnrpmie of ·obtaining fresh data and material to be used iu the compilation of the Atlantic Coast Pilot and its subdivisions, Lieut,, G<iorge H. Peters, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Sur\·~-, under instructions is.sued April 12, 1887, took commimd of the steamer Daisy, and after having refitted her at the navy-yard, New York, began hydrographic examinations in the East River. On May 11 an examination was made of Southeast Point Deep Reef, off the southern end of City Island, at the western entrance to Long Island Sound, and the result reported to the Office. Between June 6 and 9. Lieutenant Peters was at New Haven, Conn., on special service under the direction of the Hydrugraphic Imspector, and upon its completion he resumed the regular work of his party, making examinations in Fisher's Island Sound, Gardiner's Bay, Shelter Island Sound, and in the haruors adjacent. On June 16 be proceeded to Narragansett Bay, and was occupied in that bay and its harbors till J-une 26. Much delay was caused during this period by fog and uufa"\'orable weather. On June 28, in accordance with instructions, the Dais.I/ was turned o>er to Lieut. C. P. Perkins, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commancliug the schooner Eagrc, an1l tlie Coast Pilot party proceeded to New York aud joined the stea,rner Endeavor June 29, nuder orders to proceed to the eastern coast. Lieutenant Peters reports the resnlts accomplished at the close of the fiscal year as gratifying, and takes occasion to attribute this in great measure to the skill and energy of the officers associated with him in the work: Ensign E. H. Tillman, U. S. N., who served till June 13, and Ensign \V. J_ Maxwdl aft.er that date. Also Mr. John Ross, who served throughout the season. Care was taken to cullect from local authorities, harbor-masters, pilots, and others, all information that would be of practical mm to mariners. Resurvey of the shore-lines of Hempstead Harbor, Long Island, and of the south shores of Long Island Sound from Setauket Harbor to Eaton'1>1 Neck.-Umlcr instructions beariug date earl.r in July, 1886, Assistant C. T. Iardella took the field in coutinuation of the topographical resmTey of the south shores of Long Island Sound. Beginning witll a resurvey of the shore-line of Hempstead Harbor, Long Island, he finished that work August 11, and tltcu took up the resurvey of the north coast of Long Island from Setanket Harbor to Stony Brook Harbor, and thence to Eaton's Neck. Upon the east, this survey (scale 1-10000) connects with the work of Assistant Vinal in 1885, and upon the west with that of Assistant Hodgkins in the same year. Field operations were closed October 22. Mr. J. H. Gray served acceptably as Aid i11. the party. The statistics reported are:

During the rest of the a11tumn and part of the winter Mr. Iardella was engaged in Office-work, and in January, 18S7, received orders for duty, reference to which will be made under the heading of Section VIII. Completion of the shore-line and interim· topographical res·uri·ey of tlie north coast of Lon9 Island Sound.from the Norwalk Rii·er to Rye Ncck.-In continuation of his work of the previous season on the north shore of Long Island Sound, Assistant Charles Hosmer was occupied under instructions between June 1 arnl November 8, 1886, in filling in the details of topography from the shore of the Sound and viciuity, back to the line of the New York and New Haven Railroad uetween the Norwalk River and Rye Neck. This work is included iu four topogmphical sheets, scale 1-10000; the last sheet, which extended to Davenport's Neck aud New Rochelle, could not be finished, owing to the exhaustion of the amount available to keep the part.r in the field; the work closed, therefore, for the season at Rse ~eek.

D. V. Stuart, U.S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, commanding the schooner Palinurus, in the hydrographic resurvey of the western portion of Long Island Sound. His work was laid out upon four projections, scale 1-10000, the first three including the inshore hydrography from Sheffield Island Light to Execution Rocks, and the last covering the area of Hempstead Harbor. \Vi th the exception of some slight revisions of lines of soundings, the hydrograpby was finished by November 3.

In December, 1886, Lieutenant Stuart was transferred to the command of the steamer Endeavor, and organized his party on board of her for service on the Gulf coast, reference to which will be made under the heading of Section VIII. Resurrey of Long Island Sound.-Inskore hydrographic surveys on the north coast of Long Island.-Early in July, 1886, detaile1l instructions for hydrographic work in continuation of the resurvey of Long Island Sound were issued to Lieut. F. S. Carter, CT. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, com1rnmtling the steamer Arago. He received at the same time two projections, one upon a scale of L-20000, including tbe western part of tbe Sound from Eaton's Neck to Execution Rocks; the other upon a scale of 1-lOOOO, including Oyster Bay and vicinity. Leaving New York Jul.}' 17, the Arago arrived at Oyster Bay on the 19th, and on the following day began rmrning lines of soundings. The shore-line in this vicinity had been recently resurveyed, and as the signals were still stnnding and their positions plotted ou the projection, this sur\'e,Y, which included Cold Spring Harbor, Oyster Bay Harbor, and Oyster Bay and approaches, was speedily pushed to completion. Work was tben taken up on the sheet of the western pa.rt of the Sound, but this sheet was subsequently transferied to Lieutenant Crosby, commanding the Gedney, by whom it was finished. Two more pr~jcctions having been received from the Office, one including Huntington and Northport Bays, the other Smithtown Ray, work upon them was taken up in due course. During its progress orders were rect.\ived October 19 detaching Lieutenant Carter from the survey, and the command of the Arago aml charge of the party were transferred to Ensign W. J. Sears,

By November 15 the hyclrograpby embraced in these prqjections was finished, and on November 16 and 17 the part;v was en~aged in taking ohs<'rvatious of currents at Station No. 3 in the Sound, distant seven miles and four-tenths on a course N. 109° W. of Stratford Shoal Light. Uurrent observations were again taken November 21 and 2~, the station occupied on those (la~-11 being No. 1, distant two and a half miles from Stratford Shoal Light on a course N. 30 W. The;;(' obserrntions were the best that could be obtained at this season, it being difficult to get tweutysix consecuti\·e hourn of favorable weather in the Sonntl late in November. Ensign Sears ha8 transmitted with his report navigation noteR antl sailing directions, which will afforcl ''alnable data, in the compilation of a uew edition of the Coast Pilot.

Tidal e:caminations lt-nd comparisons in the Hudson, Harlmn, awl Ea.~t Rivers, and in Flushing, Little Neck, and 1Yewark Bays.-For th purpose of obtaining dat:L to aid in an inYestigation of the
interference tides in New York Bay and Harbor, Ueut. C. P. Perldus, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Surve;y, commanding the schooner Ea.gre, acting under Flpecial instructions from the Hydrographic Inspector, established a series of tidal stations in the Hudson, Harlem, and East RiYers, and in Newark Bay, and took such tidal obser\'atious and soundings as would Le of service in ascertaiui11g tlte sernral thlal levels prmluccd b,y the Long Island Sound and ocean tides. Lieutenant. Perkins organized his part.rand began operations iu May, 188G, as st!lted in the last annual report. For convenience of reference and 8Uf\'ey he dfrided his work into sen>ral sections, and determined the mean low-water reading for each section from a suitabl.r-located tidegauge. His first dh-ision or section was from One hundred and twenty-fifth street on the Hudson River up to King's Bridge. For tllis division the tide reductions were taken from the tide-gauge at the dock at One hundred and fifty fifth street. The mean low-water rea(ling of this gauge was determined from observations extending through one lnuar month, and the plane of reference thus derived was carried up to a tide-staff at the mouth of Spnyteu Duyvil Creek, and use1l for the upper part of the river and for the creek. The second division exteudecl from Kin~'s Bridge through the Harlem RiYer to \Vard's Island, and the tide reductions were taken from the gauge at Randall's Island boat-house, it,s mean low· water rea1ling being determined from observations of the tide for one lunar month. This gauge was use1J for the work as far up as High Bridge, anti from a title-staff set at High Bridge for the remainder of the work to King's Bridge_ The third division extended from Ward's Island around through Hell Gate to J,awreuce Point, autl the mean low-water plane was as1:aimcd the same as at Randall's Island; that is, the mean low-water realliug was obtained by comparing several high aud low waters, aud following the method given in the General Instructions for Hydrogrnpbic "\-York, using the tide-staff at Pot Cove, Astoria. The fourth division was from Lawrence Point to Clausou's and College Points, including Flushing Bay, the tide reductions being taken from the gauge at College Point. Mean low water for this gauge was deterrniueu from observations through one lunar month. Work in Little Neck Bay and between College Point and Willets Point, comprising the fifth 1livisio11, was also reduced from the College Point gauge. .A. tide-staff was set up at North Brother Island, and one at Willets Point, and the run of the tide at these two positionR found to be the same. The sixth division included the upper part of Newark Bay, and the tide reductions were taken from three gauges, one at the end of the jetty in Newark :Bay, one midway in the Passaic River

work, and one midway in the Hackensack River work, the mean low-water reading being determined by a twenty-four hour comparison with a gauge at Elizabethport, N. J., observed by Lieutenant Hanus. From careful comparisons of several simultaneous readings of tides, Lieutenant Perkins reports that the plane of mean low water at Randall's Island is the mean of the planes at One hundred and fifty.fift.11 street: Hudson River, at Bellevue Hospital (foot of Twenty-eighth street, East River), and at College Point. For that reason the Harlem River and HPll Gate work has been reduced to tb:tt plane, the Hudson River work to a plane about 0.5 foot higher, and Flushing Bay to a plane one foot lower. Few changes were found to be needed in sailing directions for the localities under survey. Special reports and tracings of such changes for the channels between North and South Brother Islands, between South Brother Island and LawrPnce Point, and between Lawrence Point and the Sunken l\leadow were transmitted to the Office. It having been reported, through the Hydrographic Office of the Navy Department, that there existed an uncharted ledge between Lawrenee Point and the Middle Groun<l (Sunken Meadow Shoal) buoy, Lieutenant Perkins was directed to examine the loealit,y, and foun<l an abrupt, narrow, and dangerous ledge, over which the soundings were very irregular, and having over it a least depth of thirteen feet water. The bearings of this ledge from well-known points in the loc:ility, with directions for avoiding it, were given in Notice to l\fariners No. 82, bearing date December 1, 1886. Operations afloat were closed for the season November 17.

B. :Fletcher and W. E. Parmenter were attached to the party aboard the Ea,grc. In Ma:reh, 1887, Lieutenant Perkins was instructed to reorganize his party on board the Eagre, and to make current observations and hydrographic examinations in the eastern part of Long Islaml Sound. Reference to this work has been made under a previous heading in this section. Physical hydrography.-The circulation of the sea through New York Harbor.-Goticlusions, recommendations, and stiggestions derfoed from studies of the resurvey of tlie harlJor.-In the report on the circulation of the sea through New York Harbor, which is now in press as Appendix No. 13 to the annual report for 188G, Assistant Henry Mitchell, in charge of the physical survey of that bay and harbor, states as a proposition the existence of a resultant o:r net movement through New York Ilarbor from the Sound to the ocean. This proposition he demonstrates, first from a tlieoretical and then from an inductirn point of view. There are so many variables that enter into tidal currents, and it is so difficult to continue the observation;; long enough to eliminate these, that no conclusion conl<l have been safoly b~sed upon the inequalities of ebb and flood. Fortunately a comparison of computed curves, so adjusted as to represent the tidal profiles of the Sound and harbor as given in the general tide-tables, revealed the inevitable presence of this net movement before it was discovered that current observations made as far back as 1871 told the same story. The best work, however, in the way of current observations was done in 1885 by the party in charge of Assistant H. L. Marinuiu. They gauged the East River from side to side aud from top to bottom, at Nineteenth street and at Old Ferry, sections some ten miles apart. The observations were continued thirty-six boun; at each section, so as to eliminate the diurnal inequality, aud the rmrnlts were 342 and 448 millions of cubic feet, respectively; as the net discharge westward for each twelve hours. " It is this circulation which keeps the port open in winter and sweeps the sand from its threshold." In a later paper, forming part of his annual report-, Mr. Mitchell submits recommendations and suggestions having an impQitant bearing on schemes of future work. The general purport of these is its follows : Hitherto the surveys for the development of the ph~·sical hydrograpby of the harbor have all been carried on in the dry season, July, August, and September, when the rivers run low,

and while the subcurrent of sea-water is pouring into the Tappan Sea and the bed of the Hudson. Observations ougl1t to be made at two other seasons-when the rivers are frozen and wheu they are in tlood, i.e., in l"ebruary and April-winter aml spring. Iu concert with the automatic tidal record kept up at Sandy Hook, a similar record should be kept at Willets Point, in order that the variations of level which iu<luce the scoul' of the harbor and its channels may be known, whether these variations arc due to influences of the sun and moon or to meteorological causes. It would be very desirable als;o to have observations made iu New York Bay, and iu other great bays and sounds, of the variations of temperature and specific weights of sea-water. Few comprehend how very gradually the sea cliills as winter comes on, and bow orderly the variations appear when plotted on profile paper. Mr. Mitchell is of opinioll that where no ri\·er water!'.< change the densities, the date at which tl.Je danger poiIJt for freeziug is reached could be predicted in the almanac, and the actual closing of the port announced by the Weather Bureau. Reference is made nuder the heading of Section I to other investigatio11s in physical hydrograpby which have occupied ..\fr. Mitchell's attention, and under a subsequeut heading in this section to his connection with the work in Delaware ltiYer and Bay. Continuation of suriieys for the development of tlte phy8ical h.lfdrography of New York Bay and Harbor.-In respomie to an urgent call for tlie coutiuuaiion of the importaut physical sun-e.rs in New York Ba,y aU1l Harbor, instructions were given towards the end of August, 188G, t-0 .Assistant H. L. Marindin to proceed from Philadelphia to New Tork in the i;cl10011er Ready with the party i11 his charge which since the opening of the fiscal year had heeu engaged in making observations of currents and in locating pil.'r lines along tl.Je water front of Philadelphia. After detention by adverse winds at the Delaware Breakwater, the Ready arrived at New York September 12, and two days later, work in the ba~bor was begun by the erectiou of tide-gauges. The plan of operations, as devised by Assistant Mitchell, and set forth in the programme issued from the Office, contemplated the occupation of numerous tide-stations, where simultaneous observations were to be recorded, in order to get data for determining the relath-e elevation of the different tidal reservoirs whieh pour their waters into and out of the harbor. For this purpose tide-stafl:s were erected at Willets Point, College Point, Port NorriR, Polhemus Dock, Pot Cove, foot of Eighty-fourth street, Ravenswood, Hunter's Point, and Corlear's Hook in the East Hiver; also at Governor's Island, Forty-second street, Hudson River; Constable's Hook, Day Ridge, and at Quarantine Dock for the Upper Bay; and for the Lower Bay, Sandy Rook, Balli, Great Kills, South Amboy, Port Monmouth, and Oonaskonk Point. For Newark Bay and the Kills tlie tide stations were Elizabethport, Elm Park, and Hackeusack River Bridge. The tide station at Dobbs Ferry, nineteen miles above New York, on the Hudson River, was also occupied as beiug at the entrance of the Tappan Sea. While tide observations were in progress, a numbe~ of current stations were occupietl simultaneously between October 4 and 7 by the vessels of the Coast anti Geodetic Snrrn,v then i11 tile hairbor; Lieutenant Hanus, U. S. N., with the Endeavor occup~·ing a Rtatiou on the liar at Sau<l;r Hook; the steamer Daisy, attached to his party, occup_ying one in the Narrows; and LieuU.·uaut Perkins, U.S. N., with the schooner Eagre occupying one at Old Ferr,y Point, while ~Ir. Marindin's party, with the schooner Ready, occnpied a station off Twenty-third street, East H,iver. At the close of these observations the naval vessels returned to their season's work. Toward the end of the season, in order to reduce expenditureA, Mr. Marin<lin at his own request was directed to lay up the vessel and with a reduced party to continue the connection of tlw tillal stations by lines of geodesic leveling. Subassistant J. E. M(:Grath, who had joined the party in July, was detached to go on with this wo1'k, and upon November 1 he was placed in i;ole charge of it, Mr. Homer P. Ritter being assigned to aid him. Mention in detail of this ser,·ice will be made under a following beading in this section. Mr. Marindin acknowledges the kindness of Professor Ricketts, of Colmn bia College, in obtaining for him the servic(]S of a number of the graduates and undergraduate.s of tliat. iust.itutiou as tide-observers. With the aid of these young men a. very satisfactory -series of observations at the tidal stations was, secured. ·

During part of the winter Mr. Marindin was -0n duty with the United States Ad\isory Commission for the Port of Philadelphia. Having completed the drawings for this Commission, he reported for Office duty at Washington January 31, and from that date till towards the end of May, 1887, he was attached to the Division of Physical Ilydrography under Assistant Henry Mitchell. The work assigned to him was the computatio11 of the differences of eleYation ef tlle water surface in the uays and streams surrounding New York for specified times following the moon's transit, and the prnparatiou of diagrams showing these <lifierences graphically. In May, 1887, be was detached from the Office and instructed tu take charge of parties on the schooners Read.I/ and Palinurus, witll steam-launches attached, and to coutinue the investigation of the movements of the currents on Samly Hook Bar, New York Harbor. The parties on the schooner Ready and steam-launch, having been fitted out, Mr. Marindin began field-work June l by rating the telegraphic current meters to be used during the season. A week later the Palinurus joined the party. For this rating the requisite conditions of slack water, imfilcieut depth, and sheHer from wind were obtained at Factory Pond, on Staten Island, and upon its completion, June 10, the parties proceeded to Bath Beach, New York Lower Bay, where the principal tide-station and the headquarters for the schooners and steam-launches were to be established. A self-registering tide-gauge was placed on the steam-boat wharf at Bath Beach and maintained in operation during the entire season. It was referred to the bench.mark established some years before by Lieutenant Hanus, U. S. N . .At the first opportunity current ollsern1tious were begun in accordance with memoranda prepared by .Assistant Mitchell. Each channel, beginning with the most northerly one, was occupied by the schooners and launches to obtain cross-sections of current velocities at as many poiuts as could be observed simultaneously. From four to·five points were thus occupied for thirteen consecutive hours, with observations every fifteen minutes; then an interval of six hours was allowed to elapse, after which a set of observations for seven ('Onsecutive hours was begun. The velocities were taken at different depths, and with special care near the bottoms of the channels, and specimens of the bottom were obtained and preserved. Mr. Marindin found the stea.m-launches to be of great service throughout the season. He expresses himself as much indebted to the H.rdrographic Inspector, Lieutenant-Uommander Brownson, for his efforts in supplying the new launch at an early <late. For the work of June, 1887, the follo\ving statistics are reported: Number of soundings on cross-sections .................................... . 170 Number of stations occupied for observations of currents ............... _.. _. 14 Number of observations of currents .. _..... __ .. _. __ ....... ___ . __ ......... _. 1,093 Number of directions of bottom velocities observed .. _..................... . 63 79 Number of hydrometric observations ................·......... - .......... - In acknowledgment of faithful services rendered by numbers of his party, special mention iB made by Mr. Marindin of l\fossrs. E. E. Haskell, H. P. Ritter, G. E. Kent, E. H. Wedekind, W. H. Given, .A. R. Hasson, R. G. G. Moldenke, and James .A. Connor. At the clot:>e of the fiscal year the work was still in progress, and fnrtber mention of it will be made in the next annual report. Physical hydrography of New York Bay and Harb-0r.-Zeros of tide-gauges in the East .River connected by goodesic leveling.-For the study of the phenomena of tbe sncct>ssive tidal levels in the East River caused by the two tidal waves, one from the Sound and th~ other from the ocean, which meet or pass into ea.ch other in Hell Uate, Assii1tant H. L. Marindin, acting under the general direction of .Assistant Henry Mitchell, had established tide-gauges and bench-inarks at

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVJ;;Y.

39

Hunter's Point, Ravenswood, Eighty-fourth street, Pot Cove, Polhemus Dock, College Point, and Willets Point. To connect the zeros of these tide-gauges and their bench-marks, lines of geodesic leveling were run, beginning October 16, from Pot CO\'e to Polhemus Dock; from Eighty-fourth street to Pot Cove (crossing the East Niver at the head of Blackwell's Islaml), and froill an intermediate point on this line to ~avenswood and Hunter's Point. The old bench-mark of 1857 it ltavern;wood was recovered and connected with the bench-mark of 188!J. After the difference of absolute heights between the zeros of the Pot Uove and Eighty-fourth street gauges had been determined by the geodesic level, a discrepancy was fouml between this result and that obtained from observation of the mean sea-levels determined by the readings of the tide-gauges; this discrepancy appeared also when the two determinations for the differeuuc of level of the zeros of the gauges at Pot Cove and at Polhemus Douk were compared. Hence, as a means of precaution, the line between Eighty-fourth street and Pot Uove was again run, but by a different route, and a result outained for difference of level almost identical with that from the first line. On November 1 Snbassistant .T. E. McGrath was directed to take up the leveling ·work in accordance with an approved scheme which had been submitted hy Assistant l\Iariudin, and iu pursuance of which a check liue of levels of precision was run from Hunter's Point directly to Polhemus Dock, and Willets Point au<l College Point were connected with Hunter's Point. Thti connection of Hunter's Point and Haveuswood with Polhemus Dock having been established independently of the bencll-marks at the foot of Eighty-fourth street and at l'ot Cove, a new line wat; also run from Hunter':; Point to a temporary bench-mark on the Long Island B.ailroad, making the lines from Hunter's Poiut tu College Point and to Willets Point entirely independent of the lines between Hunter's Point and the bench-marks around .Astoria. In the geodesic leveling the met!hod of two simultaneous parallel lines was adopted. The number of miles of double lines run was twenty-eight. Mr. McGrath has accompanied his report by a summary of the heights of the zeros of the tidegauges and bench-marks referred to the zeros of the Ravenswood tide-gauge and beucl.t-niark of 1886. He acknowledges the valuable service rendered by Mr. Homer P. Ritter as recorder in his party. In April, 1887, Assistant J.B. Weir was directed to organize a geodesic leveling party to continue the connection of the tide-gauges and uench-marks iu aml uea1· New York lla.r and Harbor. Subassistaut J.E. McGrath and Extra Observer W. B. Fairfield were assigned to Mr. ·weir's party, each of these officers being trained and skillful in the many details of observation with geodesic levels. The method of working was the same as that followed by Mr. Weir in connecting Citronelle, Ala., with Quitman, Miss., by leveling of precision during the winter preceding. Field operations were begun April 19. Owing to the crowded condition of the streets it was necessary to keep away from the water-front and select those streets which were least used by heavy wagons. .A compromise route was therefore selected, though not without much labor; one that would afford, as nearly as possible, the shortest horizontal distance, the fewest vertical chaugei'l, the least disturbance by heavy teams, and that would at the same time keep as close as practicable to the river and bay fronts. As a main or base line such a line was run from Hunter's Point to Fort Hamilton, and offsets were run from this main line whenever it was necessary to connect on a tide-gauge. These offsets were to the tide-gauges at Oorlea1·'s Hook, New York, GoYernor"s Island, Bay Ridge between Gowanus Bay and Fort Hamilton, and Bath on Gravesend Bay. In order to reach the gauge at Corlear's Hook it was necessary to cross East River, which was done from the.,g~-house wha.rf; Brooklyn (~he first wharf below the u~vy-yard), by means of simultaneous observat10ns on both sides of the nver, each observer occupymg alternately the north and south banks of the river during four days. The sights were five hundred and twenty-one aud five hundred and thirty-four meters in lengt.h, but owing to the unfavorable weather it was necessary to take a great many observations in order to get au accurate crossing. The same method was used in crossing Buttermilk Channel from Atlantic Dock, Brooklyn, to Governor's Tula.nd.

40

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURV J.1JY.

For the crossing at the Narrows the instruments were mounted, one on the ramparts of Fort Lafayette and the other ou tlrn terrace at Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island. The sights being about one thousand four hundred meters in length, very favorable weather was required to obtain satisfactory results. This part of the work had not been completed when Mr. Weir, having been relieved from duty at hit:1 own request, turned over the charge of tlie party, ,lune 7, to i\Ir. McGrath. But the line of levels had been continued from Fort 'Vadsworth up the l>ay, and up Kill van Kull to Elm Park tide-gauge, with an offset to Quarantine tide-gauge. Mr. W. B. Fairfield was detached from the party May 12, and l\fr. John Nelson, Aid, assigned to take his place. The statistics of the work ofl887, as reported by Mr. Weir, are as follows: Miles run of geodesic leveling . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31 Tide-gauges connected and referred to permanent bench-marks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 Permanent bench-marks established and conuected with lines of geodesic leveling. 21 The.further progress of this work until its completiou by Subassistant McGrath will l>e stated in the next annual report. Topographical resurvey of shore-l-ines of New· York Bay and Harb()r and i'icinity continued ..... Reference was made in the last annual report~o the resumption in May, 1886, by the party of Assistant D. B. Wainwright, of the topographical resurve,y of the shore-lilies of New York Bay and Harbor and vicinity. This resurvey included the shore-line of the Harlem River from Randall's Island to and includ· ing Apuyten Duyyil Creek; also both shores of tlrn Hudsou Rh'er between that creek aud Seventy. ninth street. This part of tlle work was fiuished November 1, and Mr. Wainwright tlien took up the resurvey of tlie shore-line of the Lower Hay, connec~g at Keyport, K. J. 1 with the topogra1ihy executed by Assistant K .M. Bache, and extending the sL.ore-line resurYe;y to Saud_y Hook. Certain details of the work requiring re-examination, Mr. ·wainwright was occupied in this duty from December 20 till about the beginning of January, 1887.; Some triangulation of an approximate character with the plane table was needed for the determination of additional points. Subsequently Mr. Wainwright was employed on office duty, and early in March be left for Wilmington, N. C., to organize a party for service which is referred to under the heading of Section IV. Determination by triangulation of additional stations in IVetcark Bay and vicinity.-Certain additional triangulation having been found necessary to streugtL.en the determinations iu geographical position of some plane-table stations in Newark Bay and ·icinit.y, Assistant A. T. Mosman was charged with this duty by instructions issued in February, 1887. After a general reconnaissance of Newark Bay and an examination of stations for occupation in the towns of Elizabeth and Bergen, N. J., ou Staten Island and in New York Cit.r, Mr. Mosman began his observations March 8, having mounted his tlieodolite on tbe outside of the spire of the First Presbyterian Church in Elizabeth. Other stations successfrely occupied were tlie top of the tower of the Reformed Dutch Church, Bergen, N. J.; the top of the tower of the Produce Exchange, New York, and station Bogart, N. J. As all of these stations were in very exposed positions, and as no tent could be used over the instrument owing to thefr peculiar location, the work was prosecuted under many difficulties, owing to stormy weather and the frequency of high, cold winds, against which the observer bad no pro· tection. 'Vhen strong winds were not blowing, the smoke from numerous chimneys at Bergen Point, Newark, Elizabethport, Jersey City, and New York so obscured the atmosphere that no signals could be seen. Field operations were completed .M.arch 24.

Contwuation of the resurvey of New York Harbor and approaches by a shore-line survey of the south coast of Statmi lsland from New Creek to Tottem;ille, 011d of the New Jersey shore from Perth .Amboy lYy way of South .Amboy to Keyport.-Reference was made in the last annual report to the progress of the topographical resuney of the shore-line of Staten Island from TompkinsYille to tLe soutllward and westward under the direction of Assistant R. M. Bache. With the shore line, tbe work included a strip of topography of moderate and varJing width just back of it, aml by ihe close of the season had been completed around Ward's Point up lJotb shores of Adhur Kill for about three and ·a Lalf miles, and thence around Raritan RiYer entrance by way of South Amboy to Keyport, N. J. Mr_ Bache reports that the difficulties of the work were largely increased by tlle loss of triangulation points, botlt on the Staten Island and New Jersey shores, so that it was frequeutly necessary, after a vain search for subsoil and other marks, to supplement with the plane tault· the deficiencies of the triangulation. Just short of Keyport the work was brought to a close, tLe plane-table deYelopment of tlrn triangulation baying there been pu.-,bed to tbe extreme lilllit perrnissilJle to such development.

G_ C. Hanus, U. S. N-, Assistaut Coal'it Survey, commanding the steamer Endeavor, was actively engaged in the continuation of that part of the resurvey of New York lfay and Harbor which had been assigned to him by instructions dated earl,Y in June, 1886. The steamer Daisy and a steam-launch Laving been added to the party equipment, Lieutenant Hanus was enabled, duriug most of the season, to keep two parties constantly at work, and at times he had two parties engaged in builtling antl determining signals, while a third party was takiug soundings. Ile was thereby enabled to finish a bydrographic survey which was laid out upon nine pn:~jections, coYeriug the following-named localities: Oft' Sandy Hook (scale 1-20000); Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays (l-'.!0000); vicinity of East Channel (l-10000); the Narrows (1-5000); Arthur Kill and Staten Island Sound, four projections on a scale of 1-5000 each; and Newark Bay (1-10000). Repeated examinations of the bar in the East Channel were made, so a:,; to obtain a complete survey of the !Jar at each examination; a number of spots requiring additional soundings were also developed in different parts of. the harbor. During several days the entire party was engaged in observations of currents. Three wrecks were located during the season: One off Elm Tree Beacon; one t-0 the eastward of the wharves at South Amboy, and the third near Chelsea Landing, Arthur Kill. Descriptions and positions of these wrecks were communicated to the Office, and their exact locations were marked upon the hydrographic sheets. All work with reference to the tides was, as heretofore, placed under the direction of Ensign G. R. French, U. S. N. The standard tide-gauge, with which all other gauges put up during the season were compared, was the box gauge which had been established by Lieutenant Hanus in May, 1885, on the &team boat wharf at Bath, Gravesend Bay, Long Island. Ou July 2, 6, and 7, tides were observed at the gauge of the United States Engineers at Government wharf, Sandy Hook. The mean low water given by the engineer in charge of the gauge was found to agree to a tenth of a foot with the one found hy comparison with the Bath Beach gauge. A care£ul examination made in 1885 developed the fact (which was referred to iu last year's report) that high water occurs at Bath but ten minutes later than at Sandy Hook, and that there is no practical difference between these two places in the rise and fall of the tide. The comparison taken this year agreed with that of last year, although last year the comparison was made with mean low water as given by the Coast and Geodetic Survey gauge, and this year with that given by the United States Engineer gauge. Tbe other tide-gauges established during the season to obtain planes of reference for the soundings were at the st.eam-boa.t wharf, San Lora.to Orphan Asylum lanuiug, Princess Bay ; at

Rutau's marine railway, Totten ville, S. I.; at the wharf at the Sewaren Hotel, Arthur .K,,iJl; at the steam- boat wharf at Rossville, Arthur Kill; and at the dry-dock wharf, Elizabethport, N. J. Oare was taken as usual to refer a known mark ou each gauge to a well-secured bench-mark. Early in November, the season's work having been accomplished, operations afloat were sus· pended, and the party took up office-work. The following-named officers were attached to the Endeavor: Ensigns C. S. Ripley, E. F. Leiper, G. R. French, and H.P. Jones, u. S. N. Lieutenant Hanus reports statistics for the season as follows: Miles run in sounding . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1, 524 Angles measured. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18, 115 Number of soundings ............................................. _. _.. 105, 927
In January Lieutenant Hanus was detached from the Survey. Arrangements had been made previously for the transfor of the Endeavor to the command of Lieut. D. D. V. Stuart, U. S. ·N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, and for her fitting out for service on the Gulf coast. Hydrographic e.xa.m·ination of tlte Swask Oltannel, New York Bay.-A shoal spot in the Swash Channel, New York Bay, having been reported in a letter from Mr. Nash, secretary of the Board of Pilot Commissioners of New York, Lieut. F. H. Crosby, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was instructecl in May, 188i~ to make search for the supposed obstruction. Before proceeding with the work, Lieutenant Crosby had a conference with Mr. Nash and with the pilot who bad charge of the steamer Illinois when she grounded May 11. From the latter he learued that it was too fog·gy at the time to see the ranges; that coming in from sea he sounded on the starboard, finding twenty-three feet, but did not sound on the port; that he took a careful bearing of the Romer Beacon, and estimated its distance; that he had no other means of getting his position. Lieutenant Crosby reports as the result of his examination his conviction that the pilot was considerably out in estimating his distance from the beacon, and that the soundings as given on the latest chart show actual depths. Series of tidal observations with automatic tide-gauge at Sandy Hook, New Jersey.-Reference was made in the last annual report to the detail of an officer of the Survey to select a suitable place or places at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, for the erectiou of permanent automatic tide-gauges, the old location having been found to be unsuitable. The structure then begun for this purpose was finished early in the fiscal year, apd it was decided to put up two automatic tide-gauges, the slight additional expense, which is merely that of the paper on which the tidal curve is traced, being more than oompensated by the safeguard afforded against breaks fn the record due to the occasional and almost unavoidable stoppages in this greatly exposed locality. The tides of Willets Point should be observed in concert with those of Sandy Hook, in order (adopting Assistant Mitchell's phraseology) that the variations of level that induce the scour of the harbor of New York and its cllannels, whether due to processes of sun and moon or to meteorological causes, may be recorded. Geodetic operations.-Oontinuation of the triangulation in eastern PennBylvania towards the northern boundary of the State.-Iustructions having been received by Assistant William Eimbeck, towards the end of August, 1886, directing him to report for duty in the party of Prof. Mansfield Merriman, engaged in geodetic operations in the State of Pennsylvania, and to relieve Professor Merriman in the charge of the party when so requested by him, Mr. Eimbeck left Washington August :J8, and on the 31st reported to Professor Merriman near Ashland, Pa. Next day, as previously arranged, he took charge of Professor Merriman's work at Barry station. Tbe observations at Barr~· station bad been partly completed when Mr. Eimbeck took charge, and were finished by him September 13. The next station to be occupied was Catawissa, about three miles to the southeastward of the town of that name on the Susquehanna River. Owing to delay occalilioned by the heliotropers, who were students at the Lehigh University, being obliged to leave the party to resume their studies, Mr. Eimbeck was not able to complete all his arrange· ments for observing at this station till October 2.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

From that date until December 6, when the observations were finished, the closest application

to tbe work failed to secure satisfactory progress, owing to the almost constant pn·valence of an
atmospbere charged with dense ismuke. The provisional occupation of Line Mountain aml .Montour stations was next undertaken in order to determine the position of Little :Mahano_y, a seco1H1-order point1 the geographical co ordinates of which had been applied for by Professor Ash burner, of the State Geological Survey. Snow had fallen by this time and had accumulated considerably in the uplands of the mountains of that section of the Susquehanna basin. Some delays were thus occasioned, but tiually enough observations were secured at the two stations named, arnl on December 15 field operation;; were closed. They were confined this season to measures of horizontal and vertical angleH or donble-zenitl.l distances. Having reported for duty at the Office, Mr. Eimbeck devoted his time mainly to the completion of the records and results of his field-work. He determined also the instrumental coustauts of the Repsold Vertical Circle, No. 76, and those of the Coast and Geodetic Survey magneto11H't1T, No. 15, an instrument of Russian pattern and construction. He made ali-:o a special report wit Ii a view to the reconsideration of the location of a primary base-line in Utah, the result of which was the adoption of a line near Salt Lake, instead of the .Juab base previous]~- adopted. A.hout the middle of April Mr. Eimbeck was instructed to resume as early as practicable Iiis field-work in Utah, and left Washington for this purpose April 24. Reference to this service is made under the heading of Section XVI. Pliy8ical hydrography.-Observations of currents in Delaware River and Bay.-At the opeui11g of the fiscal year the party of Assistant H. L. Marindin, on board Uie scli.ooner Ready, Lad ueeu engaged since early in }fay, 1886, in making observations of currents in the Delaware River a.born the city of Philadelphia. These observations, which were undertaken to enable the United Stat.l's Advisory Board for the port of Philadelphia to determine and locate pier-lines along the waterfront of the city, were completed about the middle of July. Just before this time, in pursuance of a suggestion from Assistant Henry Mitchell, in general chargti of physical hydrographic surveys, Mr. Marindin was directed to continue the obserrntious of currents towarus the Capes of the Delaware, with the view of ascertaining the rate of progres.~ of the time of maximum strength of currents, additional observations being deemed desirable with reference to the rule for currents in Delaware Bay and River, given by Mr. Mitchell in Appemlix No. 18, Ueport for 1881. The confirmation of this rule, or its application by more strictly deJi.uell geographical limits, was desired. Series of current. observations were made at three principal points! oue within the harbor of Philadelphia, at the foot of Petty's Island; one at the Bight of New Castle, and lastly, one 011 a line between Capes May and Henlopen, about three and a half miles from the latt. Owiug to the exposed position of the station off Cape Ilenlopen the series was interrupted by bad weather, so that the vessel had to seek refuge behind the Breakwater. As the weather coutinued unfavorable and the necessity for resuming the New York Harbor work became urgent, Mr. Marindiu was instructed to proceed to that port towards the end of August.

Physical hy<lrography.-Observations of the formation and movement of ice in Delaware River and Ba.y during the icinter of 1886-'87.-Uuder instructions issued in November, 1886, Assistant S. C. l\foCorkle began preparations in that mouth for resuming observations of the formation and movement of ice in Delaware River and Bay. Mr. McCorkle has suumitted a full report of bis observations, containing facts of much interest to all navigators frequenting the port of Philadelphia. Ice began to form in the river early in December, a month soouer than usual. The plan of work hl\'olve<l, in addition to observations by l\Ir. Mccorkle personally, observations by the keepers of twelnl light-houses on the river and llay; by the masters of six steamers of the Winsor Line (Philadelphia and Boston), and by the masters of twelve steam-colliers in the service of the Philadelphia and Reading Uailroa<l. Also a series of obi:;ervations at Delaware Breakwater by .Mr. S. P. Allmond, of the J>hiladelphia Maritime Exchange. Mr. Allmond noted the temperature arnl !leusit.v of the water in the bay during the season beginning November 28, 188G, and ending February 28, 1887, as well as the ice movemeut. Ice formed in the river December 4, and practically disappt>ared January 31. Its formation aud movements are discm;sed by Mr. Mccorkle with reference to three sections of the distance from Philadelphia to the Uapes; the first from Philadelphia to Chester, the second from Chester to New Castle, and the third from New Castle to the Capes. In each of these sections he notes it diminution of the uaugers aud o bstructious due to ice as compared with conditions exii:;tiug in previous years, and reports that during the winter the port of Philadelphia was not closed a single day by reason of ice. Reasons are given for this improved state of tilings, and recommendatiom1 made for hydrographic surveys of the channel at Cherry Island Flats, over Fort l\liffiin Bar, and of Goose Island Bar, above Fort Delaware. Also that a tide-gauge should be estaulished and observations kept up during the winter at Edgemoor, on the river, near Cherry Isla.ml Flats. Mr. Mccorkle acknowledges the kind co-operation of Capt. George B. White, U. S. :N., LigbtHouse Inspector Fourth Dist.rict, of Messrs. Henry Wiusor & Co., agents Philadelphia and Boston Steamship Line, and of Capt. J.B. Gallag:ller, superinttindeut of the steam-colliers of the Philadel11hia and Heading Railroad Company. The masters of these vessels rendered a gratuitous ' service which was very creditably performed. He expresses al:;;o his obligations to the J>hiladclphia Maritime Exchange for uniform courtesy and permission to emvloy one of its obsen'ers, and to the Director of Public Work8 of the city of Philadelphia for facilities of access to the city records. RefereIJce to duty in charge of the suboffice at Philadelphia, with which Mr. Mccorkle was charged duriug the fiscal year, i8 made towards the conclusion of Part II of this volume. Geodetic operations.-Extension of the triangulation and reeonnai8sanoe in southern New Jersey toira-rd.8 Delawa.re River and Bay.-CJpon resuming field-work in the southern 11art of tbe State of New Jersey, iu Ma~·, 1886, under instructions to carry the triangulation and reconnaissance to the westward and southward, Prof. E. A. Bowser began the erection of tripod and scaffold obsen·ing signals at stations Newfield aud Richland, the former in Gloucester and the latter in Atlantic County. These siguahi, each forty·three and a half feet in height, were finished early in June, when the allotment for the work having been exhausted, field operations were .suspended, pending action upon the appropriation for State 1mrveys. In September, work was resumed by the occupation of Hammonton station in the vicinity of the town of that n:une in Atlantic County. Some obsen·ations had been made at Hammonton in 1885, llut the series wail incomplete, Newfield and Richland uot being then in readiness to be observed upou. The season of 18S6 proved to be very unfavorable to rapid progress owing to a very smoky condition of the atmosphere, caused by forei:;t fires. B~· November 22 the observations were completed, and on the ucxt day the reconnaissance wa_s resumed, the first step taken being to carry out the recommendation of Assistant 0. 0. Boutelle, in S[Jecial charge of State . surveys, and endeavor to establish a connection with stations Jocelyn and Pine of' the old primary series. Signals were built ninety and one-half feet in height at Jocelyn and one hundred and five feet in height at Pine Mountain, and some days were spent in trying to see these high signals from the scaffolds at Newfield and Richland, but without success, owing to tall timber on the interven-

ing ridges.

The reconnaissance was then continued from the point where it bad been closed in December, 1885, and the intervisihili ty of thf'l line N ewfteld-Bridgeton was satisfactorily determined. Bridgeton was therefore selected as a primary station to connect with Newfield and Kdlogg. On December 10, field-work was closed for the seasou. The total number of observations was four hundred and forty-four, of which four Lumlred and twenty were upon primary stations. Upon taking the field, m11ler iustructiom;, early in May, 188i, Professor Bowser resumeu his reconnaissance, directing it specially to the selection of a station tweh·e or six~een miles to the westward of Newfield, from which coulcl he Reen Bridgetou, Newfield, and 'Villiamstown, and at which could be obtained a good view of the country to tlie north, west, and south of it. Tripods were erected at a number of points; the country being flat and in man.v places heavily timbered, tlrn trees often growing to heights of ninety and one hundred feet, the tripods ranged in lleigl1t from ninety-five to one hundred and twenty feet. Without completing this reconnaissance, Professor Bowser deemed it ad,·isable to de\·ote the summer months to observations of horizontal angles, ancl accordingly on June 2 lie began the occupation of station Richland. The party was still engaged in obserrntions at this point at the close of the fiscal year. The station point had been careflllly marked by a granite monument four feet long, dressed six inches square at top and for a length of six inches, with the letters U. S. cnt in each of the four faces, and a triangle cut on top. It is set in hydraulic cement. Connection of old with new triangulation in the vici1iity of Absecon Light, coast of Kew Jersey.In order that the triangulation of 1884 near Absecon Light, on the New Jer:se,\· coast, might be extended so as to form a connection with one of the sides of the old triangulation to the northeastward of that point, Assistant Joseph Hergesheimer was directed towards the en1l of August, 1886, to make search for such of the points of the old triangulation as would sene as a base for effecting the connection desired. This he aecomplisbed hy using for a base and azimuth the liue Absecou Light to Leeds Point. .l!'rom this base he determined in geographical position the new Light-house wbieh had been hnilt at Little Egg Harbor, and carried a triangulation towards Cape May to the line Gro·e-Linwood of the triangulation of 1884.

M. Bache, using the barge Beauty for the accommodation of his party, carried the topography from two to four miles inland, and along shore to a point about one mile north of South Atlantic City on Absecon Beach.

Tlte port-warden liues of the city of Baltimore traced out on the ground and connected with the triangulatfon of Baltimore Harbor.-In 1876 an accurate topographic survey was made of the wharf and harbor lines of the city of Baltimore and a hydrogmphic survey of the harbor, at the instance of the local authorities and nuder the direction of a IJoard authorized by the President of the United States. With the concurrence of this board, consisting of C. P. Patterson, Superintendent of the Coast Survey, General A. A. Hump hrcys, Chief of Engineers, and Maj. W. P. Craighill, U. S. Engineers, the execution of the work was assigned to Assistant J. W. Donn, of the Coast Survey. Copies of the original topographic sheets of this special survey, filed in the Coast Survey archi,'es, are in possession of the Harbor Board of Baltimore, and upon theRe copies ~ere laid down the port-warden lines for the harbor. Mention was made in the last annual report of the detail in June, 1886, of Assistant O. H. Tittmann to confer with .Maj. N. H. Hutton, engineer of the Baltimore Harbor Board; and in pursuance of' their request, to trace tbese lines on the ground and connect them with the triangulation in such a way that they can be repr0<luced by reference to ground- marks. In conformity with Major Hutton's suggestion, Mr. Tittmann confined his work to tracing the pier-head line around the harbor, but the bulkhead line in certain places only. The method pursued was to transfer the port-warden lines to the original sheets; these rsheet." were then taken into the field, and in general the points of de:tlection of these lines were identified by means of the plane table. They were then referred hy 1listance measurements and tleft1:-etion angleR to stoneR planted by Mr. Tittmann in the streets or sidewalks of the city, except where no streets had been opened, as along the Middle Branch of Patapsco River, wlwre the stones were set along the high-water line. The stones were all connected with the triangulation and their locations were accurat-Oly described in the records. AR a base for the needful triangulation, 1\-[r. Tittmann adopted the same line, Bay View-Monument, a.."! bad been used in 1876, and as the progress of the measurements between the reference stones in the streets disclosed a want of accorcl between the distances determined by these measurements and thoRe deduced from the triangulation, it was deemed advisable to strengthen and check the triangulation by connecting it with some of the primary stations.

47

Finally, however, on account of the difficulties of recovering the stations proposed and the expense attending their occupation, it was decided to obtain the desired check by the measurement of a base and its introduction into the trianguhttion. A site of about a mile in length having been selected ou Fort avenue, the measurement was made with the four-meter contact-slide base apparatus, and a correction found and applied to the previously accepted distance, Bay View-Monument. · BJ the field-work, which closed November 20, one hundred and seven geographical positions were determined, of which all but eleven were new. Assistant Tittmann was aided in the work by Mr. J. Henry Turner, whose efficient serYice he acknowledges in his report. The records, sketches, and computations of the work have been filed in the archives, and its results have been communicated to Major Hutton for the use of the Baltimore Harbor Board. Other duty assigned to Mr. Tittmaun is referred to uuder the heading of Section VIII in this report. Soundings in Baltimore Harbor, and mea,snrements along the harbor front.-Maj. N. H. Hutton, engineer of the Baltimore Harbor Board, ha;l'ing applied for the services of an officer of tlie Survey to execute certain work supplementar,r to that accomplished l>y Assistant Tittmann, and re'ferred to under the heading just preceding, Subassistant W. I. Vinal was instructe;l, towards the end of March, 1887, to proceed to Baltimore, and in conjunction with Mr. Hutton to make a hydrographic survey of such portions of the harbor as bad been agreed upon in conference between Mr. Hutton and the Assistant in charge of the Office. Mr. E. L. Taney, Aid, was assigned to the party. In connection with the soundings, some miscellaneous measurements of street8 and wharYes along the harbor front were made. This duty occupied Messrs. Vinal and Taney during the month of April. Upon its completion they were each instructed to organize parties for a resumption of topographical work on the north shore of Long Island Sound. Reference to this service is made under the headi11g ot'!3ection II. Annual determination of tlte ma,gnetic declinnt,ion, dip, and inU!nsity at tlie sta-tion on Capitol Hill, W ashington.-Neces1;ity for the selection of a ne10 station reported.-On the 14th, liitb, and 16th of June, 1887, Assistant Charles .A. Schott made the usual annual determination of the magnetic elements at Washingt,on, D. C. Two stations were occupied, first the one in use Rince 1877 on First Rtreet, Capitol Hill ; and then, as this station was found to be affected by local attraction, a station about forty-one feet west of it. Since the observations of 1886 were made, a two-story brick building, used as an instrumentshop, bad been erected within six feet of the magnetic observatory. The second station was selected to avoid the influence of the iron contained in tl1is building, but the results obtained show that here the needlt> is affected by a two·inch vertica,l east-iron pipe in a neighboring house, about tbirtJ feet off. Mr. Schott recommends, therefore, the abandonment of this locality altogether and the selection of a new station, which should be far enough away from the Capitol to be unaffected by its massive iron dome. At the old station the normal declination was fomid to be increased by fifteen minutes of arc, and, at the second one occupied, diminished by forty-eight minutes; the dip and horizontal and total intensities were affected likewise, and in a manner indicating the special causes mentioned. Continuation of the detailed topographical survey of the ])fatrict of OolumGia.-At tbe beginning of the fiscal year, the operations of the party of Assistant John "\Y. Donn, in charge of the detailed topographical survey of the District of Columbia, had advanced the work to the Distributing Res· ervoir; thence along the Conduit road to a point one-quarter of a mile from the uorthwestern bound· ary of the District; thence by an irregular ltne in a northeasterly clirection thro!1gh Tenna1lytown to Rock Creek Valley, a half mile below the Military road. During the followmg summer and autumn, the survey of the country lying between the Conduit road and the river, arad the open country·lying between tLe irregular line above mentioned a.nd the northwest boundary as far to the north as the Bell road, was finished. Tbe difficult work through the rough and wooded region from Tennallytown to Hock Creek, and all of the small areas

not touched during the summer, because impracticable, were completed during the winter, excepting that immediately about the receiving reservoir, known as the Government farm. At the opening in the spring of the season for field operations, at the request of Capt. Eugene Griffin, Assist.ant Engineer Commissioner of the District, Mr. Donn began work upon sheet No. 1, Eastern Division, which covers the lines of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at their entrance intv \Vashingt-011. Field-work was continued until l\1ay 8, when the exhaustion of the appropriation for the survey made a suspension of the work necessary for the remainder of the fiscal year. On account of this suspeusio11, which kept the party out of the field nearly two months, the area coYerecl during the year scarcely equals the usual amount, but the standard of accuracy establishecl at the beginuing was carefully maintained. Jfagnetic observations ; establishment of a meridian line and marking of a station at Gharlottes1·illc, ra.-Assistant C. H. Sinclair having been authorized by instructions issued <lctober 23, 1886, to mark permanently the astronomical and trigonometric station of the Survey at the McCorinick Observatory, ne'ar the Uui>ersity of Virginia, and to establish at the magnetic station at Olmrlottesville a meridian line: took the field early in November for these purposes.. 1'he station point near the observatory was mhrked by a granite post twenty-one incl.res loug aml eight inches square, dressetl down one incb from the top, with a hole one and a quarter inches in diameter on the upper face, inside of which a quarter-inch hole was drilled. For an underground mark, a hole eighteen inches below the surface was drilled in the bed-rock. Azim nth was determined at the magnetic st~tion, Charlot+esville, by forty-two observations on Polaris, time being furnished by the Western Union Telegraph Company. The ends of the meridian line were marke(l by two meri11ian stones 1 four hundred feet apart, each one of James River granite, and with dimensions au<l mar·kings similar to the stone just described, except in length, the meri· dian sto11cs being each forty inches long. These stones wer!Hurnished by the county of Albemarle, and were set without any expense to the Coast and Geodetic Surrny. Instructious for other duty received by Mr. Sinclair led to tbe postponement of the magnetic observations till April, 1887, when they were made jointly by himself and by l\1r. John Nelson, Aid, on the 5th, tlth, and 7th of tbat month. Reference is made nuder the beadings of Sections IV, X, XI, XV, and XVI to service elsewhere assigned to Mr. Sinclair. Jfagnetic observations at stations in Virginia.-Tbe occupation of two stations in Virginia for the determination of the magnetic elements was included in the plan of field·work assigned to Assistant James B. Bay !or by instructions issued January 6, 1887. At Williamsburgh, Va., the st.atiou of 1874 in the grounds of William and Mary College was re occupied. The declination was determin~d by observations for three days, the dip and intensity on two days, and the azimuth of the maguetic meridian by obser\rations of the sun ou oue day. At Cape Henry, Virginia, the station of 1874, near the old light-house, was re-occupied. 'l'he declination was determined on three days, the dip and intensity on two days, and the direction of the magnetic meridian by observations of the sun on one day. Other stations occupied by Mr. Baylor during the season are referred to under the headings of Sections IV, V, VI, and VII. Reconnaissance ttnd triangulat-ion in the vicinity of Cape Charles, Virginia.-In pursuance of iustrnctious issued in "April, 1887, subassistant R. A. 1\larr, having been detached from duty m the Computing Division of the Office, proceeded to Cape Charles; Virginia, to make a secondary triangulation in sufficient detail to furnish points for a topographical resurvey of the outer shore-line in that vicinity from station Rosemary on the Bay side about fifteen miles north of the Cape, around the Cape and up to Sand Shoal Inlet. He was directed, moreover, to give particular attention to a scheme which should extend from Costin station, on the Chesapeake shore, about three and a half miles from Cape Charles, around by Cape Charles Light-house, and northeastward a Jong the Atlantic shore about ten miles, keeping in mind the necessity of so locating the stations and l.milding the signals that they would serve the uses of a hydrographic party soon to follow. At the close of the fiscal year this work was approaching completion, and about two weeks later was finished.

Re-establishment of that part of the boundary line between the States of Virginia and North .Caro· lina extending from the Atlantic coast westward to the Nottoua.y River.-In pursuance of authority granted by the Secretary of the Treasury in respomm to a request from the Governor of Virginia, Asl:'istant C.H. Sinclair, in November, 1886, was assigned to uuty in connection with a Commis8ion for re-establishing that part of the boundary line between the States of Virginia and North Caro. Jina wllich extends from the .Atlantic coast westward to the Nottoway River a distance of ' sixty miles. Maj. Conway R. Howard, on the part of the State of Virginia, and Hon. W. D. Pruden, on the part of the State of North Carolina, constituted the Commission. Mr. John Nelson, Aid, was assigned to duty with Mr. Sinclair. The line was originally surveyed by Commissioners from England, and later by Colonel Byrd, in 1728. After a meeting had been held with the Commission a definite plan of operations was outlined. This plan involved the occupation of five latitude stations and the determination of azimuth at each, as well as at any intermediate point deemed necessary. The tracing: of the line, opening of vistas, etc., it was arranged, should be done by the surveyor of tlie Oomlllission. The first station selected was at the supposed boundary stone on the Dismal Swamp Canal, that being the only known stone on the boundary. Mr. Sinclair states that it is quite evident, from the latitude observations both east and weilt of this point, that the stone was over six hundred feet north of the boundary. According to tradition this stone was set about the year 1800, more than seventy years after the line had been run b.Y Colonel Bsrd. This station is nearly mhl· way between the Atlantic Ocean and the Notfoway River. The second station was near tbe Norfolk and Southern Railroad, about a mile south of North· · west Depot and ten miles east of the Dismal Swamp Canal. The third was on Knott's Island, about three miles from the sea; the fourth on lan<l of Dr. Hines, about ten miles west of the canal; the fifth and last was on the west side of Nottoway River, very near the old boundary run· ning west from that point, and about half a mile south of the boundary east of the Blackwater River. These five stations divided the distance into four sections. Polygonal lines starting on a tangent in the prime vertical of the azimuth point connected the stations. Deflections to the north were made, as a rule, at every five thousand feet. At each station the magnetic elements were determined by observations on three days.

Rc-cstalilishment of that paYt of the liomidary line between the States of NoYth Cat·olina and Virginia which extends from tltc Atlantic Ocean to the Nottoway Rivcr.-Under the heading of tLc preueuiug section, foll reference was made to the detail of Assistant C. II. Sinclair to act in concert with

a Commission for the re-establishment of part of the bonndary line between the States of North Carolina and Virginia. · 'l'his honrn1ar;r liue, of about sixt.r miles in length, extends from the Atlantic Ocean to Nottoway Birer, and ha Ying lieen originally marked in the early part of the last eentnry, tlie monuments or stones had all been lost, with the exeeption of one, which Mr. Sinclair found to be quite out of position. Details of the mode of procedure adopted by Mr. Sinclair after conference with the members of tLe Commission are given under the preceding heading. Specia.I hydrograplty.-Suneys and examinations undertaken in connection irith the ini,estigation of oyster-beds for the State of 1forth Carolina.-Reference was made in the last annual report to the dt.>tail of Lieut. Francis )finslow, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, for special service at the request of the authorities of the State of North Carolina, and to tlie progress of the hydrogra.pLic sun·eys and examinations required in connection with the investigation of the oyster.beds of the State. In order to determine the areas suitable for oyster culture, the State authorities desired the location of the natural and artificial oyster-beds, aud a general examination of tLe Sounds. The field of work was limited b,y nature to those bodies of water lying to the southward of Albemarle Sound, and included Uroatan, Roanoke, Pamplico, Core, and Bogue Sounds and their tributaries. 'l'o get the data needed iu the least time and in the most economical mauner, this area had to be treated as a whole, aud not investigated by piecemeal. For instance, in the ex1Josed portions of l'amp1ico Sound, work could on1y be done in the summer season, and consequently the investigation of the bays, rivers, and creeks was left for the winter. Also the determinations of the general specific graYity could be made to a great extent during necessary passages to and from ports. For these antl other reasons Lieutenant Winslow reports at the close of the fiscal year that altl1ough the examination of but few localities has been entirely completed, the work is nevertheless well adYanced as a whole, and all of the necessary data will be collected in the course of a few · mouths. Upon its completion he will submit a full report of the work, similar in character to those publislied in Appendix No. 11 to the annual report for 1881, on the oyster-beds of James llirnr and Tangier and Pocomoke Sounds. The party was organized 011 board the schooner Scoresby. Among the various difficulties incident to tbe work and the obstacles encountered in it causing delay, Lieutenant Winslow mentions shoal water, foggy arid stormy weather, much sickness among the men, and the want of experienced assistantsIn Core Sound, the examination of which was completed in September, 1886, the water was too shoal to permit the passage of the schooner through the Sound, or even the approach nearer than from ten to twenty mile.:s to the working ground of the party. It became necessary, therefore, to establish camps on shore for the use of small detached parties, working in light-draught skiffs. 'Ihe weatLer during the year was unusually bad. In July and August, 1886, strong southwestBrR prevailed about Beaufort and Core Sounds, which made it almost impossible for boats to liYe. Ou August 23, in the passage from Beaufort to Ocracoke Inlet, a severe cyclonic gale was encountered, in which every sail of the vessel was split and one of the boats lost. During the wiuter mouths the Scoresby usually rode with both anchors down, and at times was unable for a week to lower a boat. Sickness also interfered with the progress of the party, and it was not an infrequent experience to have one-third of the working force on the sick-list. These obstacles, together with the necessity for going from one to two hundred miles for all supplies, have not only retarded the completion of the work, but made it of an extremely arduous nature for both officers and men.

.As at first organized, Lieutenant Winslow's party consisted, besides himself, of two naval officers, Lieut. B. T. Walling and Ensign J.C. Drake, and a recorder. Lieutenant \\alling was detached in July, and no one was detailed in his pla-0e until December, when Ensign C. 1\L Fahs was assigned. This officer was detached, however, on May 9, after a service of about four months. Hence, with t,he exception of about five months, the conduct of the work rested upon Lieutenant Winslow and Ensign Drake, and it was on1y by training some of the crew holding the higher rates so as to utilize them as observers, or place them in charge of boats, that field operations could be continued. Lieutenant Winslow mentions Messrs. Johu D. Battle, J. W. Stearns, E. 0. Robinson, and \V, F. Hill as having rendered efi'ectirn service, but expresses his special indebtedness to Ensign Drake, whose good judgment and careful management contributed largely to the success of the party. ltfagnetic obsen1ations at stations in Korth Carolina.-In the course of the season's work executed by Assistant James B. Baylor under instructions issued in January, 1887, four stations in North Carolina were occupied for the determination of the magnetic elements. At Smithville, near the mouth of the Cape Fear River, the station of 1874 at Fort Johnston was re-occupied. Declination, dip, and intensity were determined on two days, and time and azimuth by observations on the sun on one day. At New Berne the station of 1874 in the grounds of the National Cemetery was re-occupied, the three elements of the earth's magnetism being determined on two days, and azimuth and time on one day. Similar observations were made at Raleigh, the station of 1854 in the grounds of the State Capitol being re-occupied. At Weldon the station of 1875 in the grounds of the Methodist Church was re-occupied. But two days' observations were made at this station, the declination, dip, and intensity being determined on one day, and the time and azimuth on another. Valuable additions to our knowledge of the secular changes in the elements of the earth's magnetism may be expected by careful repetitions of observations at the same stations at periods ranging from ten to twenty-five years. Other stations occupied by Mr. Baylor between January and April, 1887, are referred to under headings in Sections III, V, VI, and VII. Connection of old with new triangulation near the mouth of Cape Fear River, North Carolina; topographical resurvey of New Inlet, and soundings in Masonboro Inlet, North Carolina.-In pursuance of instructions issued towards the close of February, 1887, Assistant D. B. Wainwright left \Vashington March 2, and having organized his party at Wilmington, N. C., took up the connection between the triangulation in that vicinity and that on the sea-coast in the neighborhood of Wrightsville and Masonboro. In order to accomplish this, it was necessary to recover two of the stations of the former coast triangulation, and after much labor, :Money Point and Berry, on the inside shore, between Masonboro and Old Topsail Inlets, were found. .A scheme of work was then laid out, consisting partly of triangulation and partly of wire measure, and prosecuted till .April 4, when its execution was temporarily suspended to take up the topographical resurvey of New Inlet. This was done in order to have in readiness all points that might be needed by a hydrographic party. High winds pre· vailed during April, retarding the work and subjecting the party to great exposure. On May 11, the triangulation and topography having been finished, the party was transferred to Wrightsville, where observations were .made for azimuth. Masonboro Inlet was also sounded, with the two principal channels leading into it. Field operations were brought to a close June 20.

and thorough, was instructed in Seritember to proceed to Charleston and make such examinations of the bar and channels as would be sufficient to decille upon reported changes. Mr. Boutelle arrived in Charleston September 10. By directio11 of tlrn St>cretary of the Treasury, the Collector of the Port had placed the revrnue steamer Hugh JlcCulloch at his service for the examinations required. After an interview with Lieut. I~. \T, Al>bot, U. S. Engineers, iu reg-ard to the tidal observer at Fort Sumter, who bad also observed for Lieutenant Ilanus, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, in his hydrographic surny of tbc bar a11d cl:mmelis executed in Apiil and May, 1886, Mr. Boutelle proceedetl at once to Fort Sumter in the .JlcCulloeli arnl st;lrtHl thlal obiservations. By noon of tlie same da.r lie began lines of soundiugs in tht~ 11orther11rnost or'' Pumpkin Bill" Channel. B.r 3 p. m., the sea having risen with the tide autl tlle coming in of the se>t· breeze, he stopped sounding and nm out five miles to the Rattlesnake Shoal Light-sbip to obtai11 her master's account of the effect of tbe earthquake upon his vessel, whicli is anclioretl in tbirty feet of water, about firn miles east of tbe "Swash" or ,Jetty Channel. The master of tbe Light-ship reported that a little before ten o'clock on the nigltt of August 31, as he was sitting iu his cabin, lie felt a shock as though a Yesscl had struck the Light-ship all(} was drag~("ing b.r them, jarring the sliip se'ierely. The shock was accompanied by a heavy rumbling sound. Springi11g to tbe deck be found the sbip shaking in m·ery part, but not vibrating. Masts and lamps were scYerely jarred, but notliing was broken and tlle lamps were not extinguished. Tile first and severest shock lasted fort.r-five seconds. :Four others were felt that night, and lighter ones had occurred every day since. At the time of the first shock there was a gentle, long-rolling swell setting in from the sea. It Witts not changed in character or volume by the shock. Tlic ship was riding with Lead to tide. S!Je dill not change her direction, nor was there any strain upon the vessel's moorings as there would Lave been if an.r wave from seaward had accompanied the earthquake. Tlie next day l\lr. Boutelle ran all lines needed to lletermine wbether any changes bad taken place in the Sonth Obannel, the one now chiefly used. The sea was much heaYier tllan 011 tlw clay before and interfered with the work greatl;\·, but sufficient data were obtained to estal1li1o;h the fact that no serious changes had occurred in either of the principal charmels used for Yesst·ls of heavy draught, and that all changes that bad taken place were for the better. Having telegraphed this result to tbe Office, he went the day after to Fort Sumter, obtai11Pd the record of tides observed during all times of sounding upon the bar, and arranged with tl1e observer to continue the observation of each high and low tide until notified to stop. U11itPd States Assistant Engineer Allen accompanied him to Fort Sumter and verified by lm·e!in;.: tlw relation of the zero of the tide-gauge to the bench-mark upon the Fort.

on the cross-sections previously adopted for the further development of tlrn currents in the Stream was immediately taken up. The very full and comprehensive report made by Lieutenant Pillsbury of this elaborate physical survey appears as Appendix 8 to this volume. It is accompanie<l by tliagrams iu whicli the observations are graphically represented, and by the aid of which his deductions are enforced. An abstract of his report is here given. Experience gained in preceding seasons had led to some alterations in the anchoring gear in order to secure quicker action and better control over the machinery, and it was found advisahle also to use a wire rope of less diameter for the current meter. The registers of velocity for the~ meters were renewed and their graduation improved so that the readings could be made more easily and with fewer chances of error. Referring to the connection between tlrn work of the two preceding seasons and that of this season, Lieutenant Pillsbury thinks that viewing the latter with the light of the former, an iuterpretation of the record can be made with considerable certainty. The sections occupied this season were three in number, one between Rebecca Shoal and Oulla (C C); one between Cape Sau Antonio, Cuba, and Yucatan (DD); autl one from Cape Hatteras Shoal in a direction about southeast. A.II of these sections are of much greater depth than en~r before attempted, and not the least gratifying foature of the season's work was the rcadineRs with which the steamer was safely anchored in these depths. The greatest was off Cape Hatteras in 1,852 fathoms, and that, too, with a surface current of over four knots. Lieutenaut Pillsbury discusses the several subjects involved in his investigations under the following heads : (1) General characteristics and limit of the Stream at each cross.section. (2) Daily variation. (3) Axis of the Stream. (4) Depth, and velocity at difierent depths. (5) Results obtained at various sections, with comparison of the same. For the details of this discussion and the conclusions which Lieutenant Pillsbury arriYes at, the reader is referred to the report. Iu closing his report he observes with reference to his project showing the lines proposed for the further development of the Gulf Stream current: "The sections drawn between the islands of the West Indies are for the purpose of ascertaining tlJC relation between the times and velocities of the current enteriug the Uaribbeau am! pa;;;;ingiuto the Gulf of Mexico. l{easoning upon temperatures and depths found in these passages a11(l in the Gulf of Mexico, it. has been stated that the water ent.ering the latter comes tllrough the 'Vind ward and Mona Island Passages. Many of the principal islands are separated by depthi,; through which most of the water flowing out of the Straits of Florida could pass. We Jiave investigated currents flowing north at two sections and one flowing east. The only place where opposite conditions can be found (and within the province of the Coast Survey to i1westigat<>), that is, where the Stream is flowing west, or contrary to the direction of the earth's rotation, bin the passages between the Wind ward Islands. ''On the observations now completed the conclusion would be arrived at that in an ocean currents flowing north the axis is west of the middle and the current extcncls to about a constaut depth. ''When flowing east, the axis coincides with the middle of the current, and tbe flow is deepest at that voint. To ascertain the characteristics of the current flowing west will be of the greatest importance to science as "\\'.CU as commerce, and will enable us to defi.ue the fixed laws governing the currents of the world with a degree of certainty which, without these data, would be very incomplete." The officers attached to the Blake were as follows: Ensign R. M. Hughes, U.S. N., executive officer and navigator; Ensigns A. G. Rogers, W. J. Sears, F. Swift, and J. K. Seymour, U. S.

Reference to other duty assigned tQ Lieutenant Pillsbury iR made under the heauings of Sections I, II, IV, and V. Completion of the triangulation on the west coast of Florida from Pavilion Key to Cape Sable.In continuation of his work of previous seasons ou the west coast of Florida, Assistant Jm;eph Hergesheiruer, .IJaving organized his party ou board the schooner Quick, in pursuance of instructions issued in November, 1886, and having made extensive repairs which it was found were much needed by the ,-essel, reached his working grouml off Pavilion Key January 9, 1887, and on the next day began a triangulation int;euded to be carried down tlte coast to Cape Sable. This triangulation began from the line .Freeland-Pavilion Key, and by April 27 had been completed to the primary base-line ou Cape Sable, the ends of which had been recovered aud the line re-established by Mr. Hergesheimer in 1886. It was intended to make the connection of the coast triangulation with the line West Base-East Base, and this involved the opening of the liue East Base to Sandy Key. It was found impracticable to accomplish this, as the line passes through a heavily wooded swamp, and after two days' cutting the men were force1l to give up work on account of tbe mosquitoes. A shorter line, ·west Base-Middle Base, was accordingly selected, but still of sufficient length to test fully the triangulation resting on the base, Caxiw IJas to Cape Romano, which was measured with beach tapes during the preceding seasou. This test was quite satisfactory in latitude, azimuth, and distance. The length West Base to Middle Base, as measured with the primary base apparatus by Superintendent Bache in 1855, was 3,215.8 meters~ and as determined by Mr. Hergesheimer by beach measurement and by triangtllation carried down the coast for eighty miles, it was 3,216.1 meters, a difference of but 0.3 of a meter, or 11.8 inches. With regard to the coast-line between Cape Romano and Cape Sable, Mr. Hergesheimer observes that it is a succession of heavily-wooded islands, for the most part low and wet, but a few high and dry. They vary in size greatly, some being of a few acres in arefl,, others several miles in lengtl.J. The Gulf shores of many of the islands are rocky; the formations being coral, in color dark-brown, some smooth, and others rough and broken. Attention is called to a tidal phenomenon on this coast which deserves investigation, the large rise and fall of tides, at times as much as five feet between Cape Romano and Cape Sable. A very stro11g current is also reported by l\fr. Hergesheimer, running along the coast on both the floo1l and ebb tide. The flood tide makes from the Gulf, and flows south along the coast towards and to the eastward of Cape Sable; hence vessels running between Key West and Cape Sable should allow for this curnmt, especially at night. Having finished his season's work, Mr. Hergesheimer impplied data needed by the hydrographic party on board the steamer Bache, and early in 1\fay laid up his schooner in Manatee Hiver, proceeding thence north nuder iustruetions for office duty. He commends the services of the very competent aids assigned to him during the season, Mr. George F. Bird and 1\fr_ J. H. Gray.

Hydrographic survey on the west coast of Florida f1·oni Cape Romano to the southward.-On the 8th of April, 1887, Lieut. J. F . .Moser, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Bache, began a h;rdrographic survey on the west coast of Florida from Cape Romano southward. His party had just completed a survey in the vicinity of Cedar Keys, begun at the outset of the season. An abstract of the report of this work will be found under the heading of Section VII.

The survey from Cape Romano southward com1iste<l in executing the inshore and offshore hydrog.
rapby from Cape Romano to Cape Sitble to the ten-fathom curve, this being the only gap in coast hydrography then remaining to be fillecl between Eastport, Mc., and the Delta of the )1ississippi.

Iu carrying a hydrographic survey along a coast the limits of which were marked by a network of islands, it was fonllll impracticable to run the lines of soundings between and around the fringing islands as had been at first intended, on account of the great delays that would be involved. As soon as the outer shore-line is passed, the dense mangroves cut off the signals, so that a new set of signals would have been needed had the original i\cheme been adhered to. I~ut the lines were always carried in as far as possible, and from islaml to island, so that the depths at the entmnees, which were seldom more than a few feet, could readily be seen. !Jieutenant ~loser observes that should it ever become desirable to ascertain tile depths between the thousands of island8 that fringe this coast, it can rearlily be done after the topography is finished, by a small party in a light-draught vessel. Continuous observations of high and low waters made day and night at a tide-gange established on one of the outlying keys gave a mean rise and fall of ti<lcs above the plane of reference of 3.34 feet. The greatest rise above this plane was 4.3 feet, and the greatest fall below it 1.15 feet. The tides as })lotted a.re regular, but show a marked inequality in range of the two daily tides. foke those of Cedftr Keys, they are largely influenced by the wind. The tidal current on and ar0Lu1d Cape Romano shoal is strong, rmrticularly during spring tid.es and on the seaward side of tlie shoal, and the flood current was found setting to the southward and the ebll current to the northward. With regard to the general character of this coast and of the country adjacent, Lieutenant .Moser observes that it is drear.Y, desolate, and uninhabited, and visited only hy turtle-hunters and plume-catchers, who sail in craft of light draught and need no guide. The islands which fringe the coast are generally mu<i lumps and thickly covered with mangrove; they are small in size, mostl;r awash at high water, and protected by a belt of oystern which have taken for holding ground the roots of the mangroves and also the O\"erbanging limbs as they droop iu the water. It is here that o.vsters may be seen growing on trees, for the spawn that lrns clung to the overhanging branches at l1igh water is develo1Jed into oysters that are Ruspemle<l at low water from the tree tops. Lieutenant Moser's report contains much information of interest to navigators, naturalists, and geologists, but the abstract given must suffice here. Ili.s surTey was completed l\Iay 21, soon after which the Bache proceeded to Ke;v West and thence north.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Inshore and offshore hydrography of the west coast of Florida from Cedar Keys to the Ohassahowitzka River.-In continuation and with a view to the completion of the bydrogra11hy of the west coast of Florida, Lieut. J. F. Moser, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, having organized his party aboard tbe steamer Bache, in pursuance of instructions received towards the closi' of November, 1886, reached Key West, Fla., December 27, and after a detention in that port for some days by a hea>y norther, arrived at Cedar Keys .January 5, 1887. The first work assigned to his party was the execution of the inshore and offshore hydrogra1lby from Cedar Keys southwanl to a point off the Chassahowitzka River, thus connecting the survey upon which the Bache was employed the previous winter with the several surveys finished many years ago and centering at Cedar Keys. At the outset, Lieutenant Moser reports that the work gave rather meager results for the time and energy employed, and the reasons for this were that the area was very large, the water very shallow, tbe shore-line without distinguishing features, and the triangulation on which the work was to be based having been executed more than thirty years ago, many of the station marks hacl disappeared. It was foun<l that the screw-piles which had been adopted at that time for marking the station point" were far more suitable for permanent markings than stone or terracotta, which has been used of late years. Some of the piles had gone, used possibly for boat anchorn, and iu one instance that came to Lieutenant Moser's notice, for a Fourth of July celebration, the hollow iron stem making a fair substitute for a cannon. But in all inaccessible places they remained, and on oyster reefo had become firmly fixed b~· the adhesion of the oysters to the stem aml flanges, and on tbe shell beaches tlw flange!! were packed solid as a rock by deposits of carbonate of lime brought up hy the tide from the many marine organisms which secrete that substance. Stones when used are frequently carried off as boat anchors, and terra-cotta pipes for station points are rendered worthless by a slight blow. The scheme of the hydrography, as carried out, consisted in developing the three-fathom curve with linel'l 11ormal to the coast, and from one-third to two-ftfths of a mile apart, and such development additional to this as was deemed necessary. The ten· fathom curve was developed with lines from one and one-half to two miles apart. About fifteen miles from shore the t.hree-fathom curve is reached, aud from there the depth increases with great regularity to the ten-fathom curve, which is about forty-three miles off sliore. To determine a plane of reference for the soundings, a staff-gauge was established near the end of the wharf leading from Faber's Cedar Mill on Depot Key. At thie gauge, which was wel·I exposed to the tidal movement, continuous observations of high and low water were made frOIJ\ February 1 to April 6. Before February 1 occasional observations had been ma.de at intervals. It would haYe been desirable to have had the gauge located nearer the center of the work, but no suitable location could be found, the shore for the greater part being fringed with oyster reefs, uncoyered at low water, and back of these are marsh islands or mud flats, bare at low water, which extend from the shore for a long distance. Comparison gauges were used with the Cedar Keys galt"ge on all parts of the work. Full details in regard to all of the tide-gauges observed and benchmarks established arc given in Lieutenant Moser's report. He observes that the tides in that locality are easily affected by winds, which cause great irregularity in their range, stand, and time of moyement. The lowest. "norther" tides fall as much as two and a half feet below the plane of reference, while winds from tlte southward and westward back the water up along the coast. During the hurricane of September 10 and 11, 1882, the highest tide known at the station occurred, the water rising to a height of twelve feet above the plane of reference. The experience aud close observation of Lieutenant Moser, both in field and office duty, lead him to urge in his report the need of parties specially'organized for the investigation of currents, the short intervals of time available in hydrographic parties for this purpose being quite inadequate to obtaining accurate results. This he found to be peculiarly the case off the Florida coast, where the set of the current, as apparent from the few observations that could be made, was not unfrequently misleading and the results contradictory. Work in the vieinity of Cedar Keys was finished April 3, and preparations were at once made for carrying out instructions for a hydrographic survey from Cape Romano to Cape Sable. Ap.

Occupation of stations of tlte triangulation in Alabama for extending the measurement of the obliqu~ arc of the mer·idian f1·om Atlanta. towards Jfobile.-The value for geodesy of the oblique arc of the
meridian along the Atlantic coast, extending from Calais, Me., to Atlanta, Ga., a distance of some twelve humlred statute mile;;;, will, it is known, be much increased by its extension to Mobile Point. The Atlantic and Gulf coast triangulations will be unitetl and an oblique arc of twenty-two degrees be obtained. For the continuation of the triangulation directed to this object, Assistant 0. H. Tittmann took the field in northern and central Alabama early in January, 1887, under instructions issued towards the close of the month preceding. Five primary stations were occupied in the course of the season- W ornock, Alpine, Horn, Kahatchee, and Laurel. These stations are included in an area limited by the parallels of 33° and 3!0 north latitude, and 86° and 87° west longitude. At each station, horizontal and vertical angles were observed, pointings being made on such hill and mountain tops as seemed notable, and a number of churches and other prominent buildings being determined in the towns of Talladega and Childersburgh, Talladega County. Field operations were completed towards the end of May. J\fr. Tittmann commends the serv. ices of his aid, Mr. J. Henry Turner. Mr. Turner was relieved May 21 and ordered to duty on the transcon ti uen tal triangulation. In concluding his report, Mr. Tittmann recommends that latitude and azimuth observations shouhl be made at station Weognfka when the work is again taken up, this being the last of the mountain stations of the oblique arc, so that there is a probability of a change of station errors on proceeding south ward. Under the heading of Section III, reference is made to other service assigned to Mr. Tittmaun. Lines of geodesic leveling carried from Oitronelle, Ala., to Quitman, 11Iiss.-By successive steps, the line of precise leveling which is intended to connect a point on the Gulf of Mexico with the transcontmental line of geodesic leveling is approaching completion. With the exception of a gap between Citronelle, .A.la., and Quitman, Miss., lines of precise leveling were continuous in January, 1887, between New Orleans by way of Biloxi, Miss., an<l Mobile, Ala., to Okolona, Miss. To fill this gap Assistant J. B. 'Veir organized a party under instructions dated January 6, and in March reached Quitman. From Okolona, in order to connect with the transcontinental line of geodesic leveling, the work must be carrietl to Villa Ridge, Ill., about sixteen miles north of Cairo. In the organization of his party for the work of 1887, Mr. Weir had the advantage of the aid of an experienced observer, Subassistant John E. McGrath, aud was enabled thereby to run separate lines of levels which should be entirely independent of each other. Mr. Weir, using geodesic micrometer level No. 3, ran the lines from south to north, and Iar. McGrath, with geodesic micrometer level No. 2, ran the lines north to south, the lines going over the same ground. The leveling-rods only were common to the two operations, hence as nearly perfect a system of checks was secured as practicable. The country passed through was generally low, fiat, sandy, and wooded with pine, broken here and there by small sand·hills1 affording on the whole a good foundation for instruments and plates to rest on.

During the season seventy-seven miles of levels, forward and backward, were run, and eleven permanent bench-marks were established. The total discrepancy between the two lines at Quitman was 4.9 millimeters, or about two-tenths of an inch. Mr. \Veir expresses llis appreciation of the care and skill with which Mr. McGrath performed bis duties. He commends also the good sen"ic11 rendered by Extra Observer W. B. Fairfield, who acted as recorder in the party, and in Mr. Weir's absence took his place as obser\·er. Field operations were closed March 24. Other service assigned to Mr. \Veir is referred to under headings iu Sections I and II. Triangulation and topograph!J upon the coast of Loufaiana, between Grande Isle and Raccoon Point.-Iu continuation of the survey of the southwest coast of Louisiana, Assistant F. \V. Perkins organized his party on board tile steamer Hitchcock at New Orleans early iu February, 1887, and after some detention by bead wind and sea off tue lmr of Grand Pass, began the triangulation and topography of that portio11 of the coast which is included between Grande Isle and Raccoon Point. The coast.line in this locality is formed by a cordon of sand-faced marsh, pierced at intervals by inlets with unknown bars at their months and a doubtful depth of water inside. The only harbors of refuge of which anything was known were at Grand Pass and Raccoon Point, nearly seventy mileR apitrt. But in the course of a recunnaissa.nce on February 7, Subassistant W. C. Hodgkins, who was attached to the party, upon sounding Chiniere Pass, found a narrow bar carrying seven feet, with a good anchorage inside in twelve feet, soft bottom. This unexpected discovery of so good an entrance and harbor within the limits of the work was very gratifying. Reconnaissance, building of signals, and tue sounding ont of bars were at once begun, and all bands working with a will, the party had, by the end of the month, notwithstanding the great amount of fog, completed the onter line of signals for the triangulation as far as Oat Island Pass, erected the greater part of tlw inner Jiue of signals, and assured themselves of the practicability of the entrances and harbors at Pass Fourchon, and Tim bullier arnl Cat Island Passes, besides finishing many miles of topograph;r and quite a number of ohsen-ations of horizontal angles. Mr. Perkins observes tllat PaRs Fourchon has bad its present depth of five feet only since the hurricane of 1886, wl1ieh wasued it out. For tlie extension of the triangulation westward and southwestward from Grande Isle, a base was selected which formed a good connecting line with the old work. From this line, TambourSouthwest base, points were established in Tambom Bay, and as much triangulation and topography done as could be readily reacl1ed from the vessel's anchorage. Afterwards the Hitchcock was taken outside, while the work of all descriptions was being completed as far as West Timballier Pass, which was entered with seven feet of water on April 16. Timballier Bay is about twelve miles wide from east to west, and if Lakes Ohien, Felicity, etc., with which it is closely connected, are included, it is about twenty-four miles from north to south. Grande du Chien, Point ,J eau, Charles, and Terrebonne Bayous empty into it, and it is connected by canal with Ila.yous Blue and La Fourche. There is a sparse population on the islands, but the main marsh is belie\'ed to be for the most part too soft and too low for reclamation. Terrebonne Bay, separated from Timballier Bay by the narrow tongue of land through the center of which Bayou Terrebonne runs, is only about half as large, and receives its waters mainly_ from Little Caillon Bayou. T11ere were no inhabitants near the southern end, but wooded islands and occasional houses were visible from Smith's Island. There are two entrances to Terrebonne Bay, Vine Island Pass, with not less than seven feet at the western end of the island of that name, and Cat Island Pass, between Vine Island and Caillou Island. Other details of local interest a.re given by Mr. Perkins in bis report, which bears internal evidence to the ability and energy with which be directed the labors of bis party. He had the aid during the season of Assistant C. T. Iardella, a topographer of long experience, and of Subassistant Hodgkins, whose name has already been mentioned in connection witlt this work. Mr. Iardella's unflagging industry is highly commended by his chief. The work in which Mr. Hodgkins was occupied was various in its character, calling for the application of exceptional methods, not unfrequently in regions difficult of access, but hiR ready appreciation of the requirements of the survey enabled him to overcome all difficulties and obtain satisfactory results.

Hydrographfo .~urvey!il on the coa,st of Louisiana.-Brief reports of siuveJ·s executed ou the coa.st of Louisiana early in 1887 havfl been received from Lieut. D. D. V. Stuart, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Endeai·or. He has sent to the Office a tracing which shows the channel cwssing the bar near Southwest Pass and entering Yermilion Bay, and also the records of work done in the survey of the dredged channel into AtchafahtFt Bay.

Triangulation begun for the examination of changes along the shore of San Diego Bny and vicinity.-Upon the receipt of instructions early in ,Tuue, 1887, Assista11t A. F. Itodgers, who had been engaged in a resurvey of San Francisco Bay entrance, made arrangements to proceed to Sau Diego, to begin there a triangulation which should determine the geographical positions and shoreline needed for the examination of changes along the sl10re of San Diego Bay and vicinity. Arriving at San Diego on June 11, Mr. Rodgers, ~ith the aid of Subass!stant Isaac \Yinsto11, had determined, by the close of the fiscal year, a sufficient number of points for the projection of the topographical sheets, and reports that the examination of changes on the shore of the bay will be carried forward as rapidly as possible. The trigonometrical determinations included the principal buildings in the city of Sau Diego, and in National City and the town of Coronado, opposite San Diego. Also the ouly ohjects available in South San Diego, all the beacons and channel buo~'s in San Diego Bar, the three bar buoys, and the hydrographic signals erected and used by the United States Engineers iu a recent hydrographic survey. A number of directions were observed also upon the Coronados Islands, twenty miles south of the entrance to the bay. Mr. Rodgers refers in his report to the cordial and steady support giYen him in both field and office work by Mr. Winst-0n.

priation for the work became available the party was sent forwanl by steamer to San Pedro, and thence by rail and wagons to Sau Juan Capistrano. Subassistant Isaac Winston, attached to Mr. Rodger.s's party, reached Capistrano August Hl, and moved the camp stored there to San Onofre, twelve miles soutli, where tlie tents were pitched. :Field-work was begun immediatel.r upou :.\Ir. Rodgen;'s arrival by the erection of signals and the·occupation of stations needed to obtaiu a base from which to carry the topography south from Point San Mateo, that being the southern limit of ti.Jc work of the previous season. Fiftceu stations lla>ing been occupied trigonometrically, the topography was taken up and contiuuml until Nm·ember 25, when the amount of funds remaining on hand made it necessary to close :fieltl operations on this part of the coast.

Subassistant 'Vinston, who had been temporarily detached and directed to report to Assistant Davidson for !luty, was re-assigned to :Mr. Rodgers's party. Reference to this duty and to service executed by Mr. Rodgers in San Diego Bay is made under other headings in this section. Serfrs of nw.gnet·ic observation11 ivith .~elf-registering niagnetfo apparatus continned at Lo11 Angeles, Cal.-From the beginning of the fiscal year until February 1, 1887, the charge of the magnetic observatory at Los .Angeles, Cal., was continued with Subassistant Carlisle Terry, except for a short period in .Jul.r, 1886, when Subassistant R. A. Marr was in charge. In accordance with arrangements previously made, Assistant Il. E. Halter reported for duty at the observatory September 7, and began at once to familiarize himself with the methods of obtaining a coutinuous photographic record from the .Adie magnetograpbs. On February 1 he relieved Mr. Terry, who, on account of failing health, had been instructed to proceed to his home and take up office-work. · This change of duty seemed for a time to be beneficial, hut the hope of Mr. Terry's recovery entertained by his friends and associates on the Survey proved to be a delusive one. His death took place at his father's residence in Columbus, Ga., March 10, 1887. Mr. Halter has submitted his annu~l report of the work of the observatory. The photographic traces giYing the record of differential measurements have been continuous, with but little exception; the absolute measures of the magnetic declination, clip, and intensity were made regularly on the 14th, 15th, and 16th of eaeh month. In the routine work he had the assistance of Mr. W. P. Miles. The statistics for the period of l\1r.

Topographical surveys on the coast of California in the vicinity of San Simeon Bay.-The topographical survey on the California coast, which was referred to in the last annual report as in course of execution by Assistant Stehman Forney in June, 1886, was continued by 1\lr. Forney until October 15, 1886, at which date the survey of the shore-line from Villa, Creek to Pico Creek was finished, and a connection made with the shore-line surveyed by Assistant Rockwell in lSil1872. He completed ah;o a detailed topographical surve~·, including the country one and a l1alf statute miles back from the coast (taking in the town of Cambria) to the mouth of Santa Rosa Creek. During the period following the close of field operations and until early in May, 1887, 1fr. Forney was engaged at the suboffice, San Francisco, in completing his field records and inking and making tracings of his topographical sheets. On May 11, having received instructions to resume his topographical survey, he proceeded to Cambria, San Luis Obispo County, wllere he organized his party and establi:>he<l his camp on the eastern end of Hearst's Rancll. Taking up the surve.y from the mouth 'Of Santa Rosa Creek westward, he had but a few da;vs' work at the close of the fiscal year to complete it to a junction witll .Assistant Rockwell's work at San Simeon Ba~'· From this locality to the mouth of Villa Creek, the country included in the topograpllical survey has for its chief features rolling hills and small valleys diYided into dairy farms. For vessels approaching this part of the coast, tLe Cambria Pines and the Pico l'ines are prominent landmarks, being isolated clumps ?f pines which are the only trees immediately on tlle coast between San Diego and Monterey. The Cambria Pines stand on both sides of Santa Bosa Creek, extending one and one-half statute miles to the southward and eastward of its mouth, and to the westward one statute mile. The Pico Pines are two and a half statute miles west of the Cambria Pines. San Simeon Bay, Mr. Forney observes, is a good southwest lee am.I a safe anchorage duriug the summer months. At this point there is a good wharf eight hundred and sixty feet long, and a large warehouse, built and owned by Mr. George Hearst (now a Senator from California), whose lauded estate extends from the Arroyo del Padre Juan to San Carpojoro Creek, embracing eJeyeu square leagues of excellent farming and dairy land. Steamers going to and from San FranCisco lancl at this wharf every four days, touching at points on the coast as far south as San Pedro. Mr. Forney gives some interesting statistics showing the large amount of imports and export8 from San Simeon Bay during the fiscal year, and the thriving trade of which the town of Cambria is the center. Other statements in his report with regard to the character of the coast, the effects of winds, etc., will be of value for the Pacific Coast Pilot. Statistics of the work accomplished are as follows: Number of miles of shore-line surveyed ·........·................. _.... _..... 13 Number of miles of roads surveyed .. _........ , ....... _... _..... _.. __ ... _... 41 Number of miles of creeks surveyed................................ . . . . . . . . . 40 Number of miles of fences surveyed ......................................... 115 Area of topography surveyed, in square miles................................ 27 General charge of Pacijic roast work.-Resurvey of Suisun Bay.-Coast Pilot work.-Hydrographic examinations.-The assignment of Assistant George Davidson to the general charge of the
operations of the land parties of the Survey on the Pacific coast was continued during the year. He has submitted general plans for the prosecution of the land work in the different sections along the coast, made out detailed instructions for each chief of party, examined estimates and referred them to the Superintendent, and, whenever practicable, has confeITed personally with the chiefs of parties. He has received and transmitted all official correspondence between the Office and tLe several Assistants and Subassistants. In .Tuly, 1886, Mr. Davidson was occupied in making astronomical and magnetic observations at stations in Oregon, reference to which will be made under a heading in the next section. On bis way down from Oregon, in July, he made such notes and sketches for Coast Pilot purposes as the weather would permit. It was too thick to get views of Leadlands, etc., with the photographing apparatus. Work was continued upon the fourth edition of the Coast Pilot for California, Oreg-on, and Washington Territory, and at the end of the fiscal year the manuscript had been finished to the

head of Fuca Straits. Some nine hundred and thirty pages of the part from the southern boundary to aml including the Gulf of the Farallones were sent to the Office for publication. Mr. Ferdinand \Yestdahl, draughtsman, was engaged in the fair copying during intervals in his regular duties, and finished the drawings of his views upon the coast. 1\ir. Davidson has about one hundred Yiews of headlands, taken lly himself upon bis trips. Of Mr. 'Yestdahl's views, thirty-four have been sent to the Office, and many more are in l\Ir. Davidson's possession. In July and August the officers attached to Mr. Davidson's party, Assistant E. F. Dickins and Sulmssistant Fremont l\lorse, were occupied in office-work, tracing the topography of the proposed Los Angc1cs base-line, duplicatiI1g records, inking the astronomical and magnetic work of the Columbia River stations, and. making preparations to take up the resurvey of tlie shore-line of Suisun Bay. In some of the work of duplicating, etc., l\fr. P.A. Welker, Ai(l iu Assistant I~aw son's party, rendered assistauce. Topographical resun·ey of Suisun Bay.-For the topographical resurvey of Suisun Bay, Mr. Davidson organizcu hhi pnrty iu September, 1886, 11Iacing Assistant Dickins in immediate charge, with Snbassistant l\forne to ai(l him. "\York was begun from tertiary triangulation stations near Ih·uicia. :Most of the olrl stations had disappeared, and new ones had to be established and occnpicd. To mark the statious along the low marsh.)· shores, sections of vitrified sewer-pipes were used, filled with sand, their tops leYel with the surface. The work was continued during the winter, though impelled by the usual storms of the rainy seasou, and was carrie(l along the south shores of Suisun Bay into the mouth of' the San Joaquin Ri\~er, anrl along the shores of the mouth of the Sacramento RiYer, including the southern marsh islands. It was stopped. April rn, when the allotment of funds was almost exhausted. Afisistant Dickins ma(lc tlle last tracings of his uuiuked topographical slicet for the party of Lieut. Da,·id Peacock, U. S. N., commanding the Coast Survey steamer Hassler. In his special report Mr. Dickiu8 expresses his irnJebtedness to Lieutenant Peacock for many courtesies extended and facilities of trausportation giveu in the course of his operations. Soon after leaving the field l\fr. Dickins was ordered to uuty on the Oregon coast, mention of wlJich will be made unuer r1 heading in the next section. Early in April, Subassistant Morse, after a short leave of absencf', was assigned to duty in Section XI with Assistant Pratt. Noonilay Rod:.-8pecia1 hydrograpltic duty.-Examinatfon at Lompoc Landing.-In pursuance of instructions for a special investigation of Noonday Rock, Mr. D:wid.'5oII directed an examination by l\Ir. vVestdahl, alHl iu December, 1886, forwarded to the Office a chart showing Urn results of the work, the principal ones of which were that the "Alaska" rock does 11ot exist, and that tlie mammoth buo,y should be placed, as was done later, near the Noonday danger. In September l\Ir. "-estdahl was instructed to examine the reported dangers near the end of the new wharf at Lompoc Landing. The Pacific Coast Steam ship Company bad agreed to pay all of the expenses of this survey. The dangers were found and .a chart of the whole work forwarclell to the Oftice; also a chart of the surn·y on a large scale plotted and drawn by Mr. ·westdahl. ln Dl~cember Mr. Westdahl was authorized to assist the Light-house steamer in locating the new buoys in the Boneta Channel and on the Four-Fathom Bank. The Lafayette Park Observatory was turned over to Assistant Edwin Smith in March, 1887, in accordanee with instructions, for the use of the telegraphic longitude parties. Duties of inspection, the charge of tidal stations, and other ser...-ices performed by Mr. Davidson or carried on under his direction are reforretl to under subsequent headings in this section and t1 c two following. Continuation of the n~urveys and examinations of the shore-line of. San Francisco Bay for the dctn·mination of changes.-The resurveys and examinations in San Francisco Bay and approaches, which were refrrrNl to in the last annual report as having made progress until early in June, 1886, were resumed by Assistant A. F. Rodgrrs, nuder instructions dated April 15, 1887. Snbassistant Isaac \Viuston, who bad been temporarily detached, was re-assigned to Mr. Rodgers's party, and joined it. April 28. The necessity of determining a number of trigonometrical points was soon apparent; these being required to enable Mr. Rodgers's party to occupy in the shore-line survey positions sheltered from the violent northwest winds which sweep through the Golden Gate.

points needed had been established in position and the shore-line snrve.r begun, when instructions were received by l\lr. Rodgers to take up a resurvey in San Diego Bay. Reference to this duty has been made under a previous heading in this section. For the San Francisco work the statistics reported are: Number of stations occupied with theodolite................................. 9 Number of directions observed .... _. _. . . . . . . . . . - - .. - - ... - __ ..... - .. - ... - . . 380 Nu1nber of geographical positions determined __ .. __ ._ - - .. _.... ___ . - .. . . . . . . . . . 27 One topographical sheet was partly completed. Resurvey of San Pablo Bay, Galifornia.-The resurvey of San Pablo Bay, which was assigned to Assistant James S. Lawson undet instructions uated August 4 and Augnst 23, 1886, w:i.s especially direct.ed to the examination of the immediate shore-line and the low-water marks, and to the delineittion of such additions aud changes in structures lying in from shore as would be available for aids to navigation. Mr. Lawson received his instructions for this work while he was at Los Angeles, on his return from Sau Pedro and Auaheim. .After his arri >al at San Francisco his preparations were made as ra.pidily as 1wssible, and on September 14, Joia\·iug organized his part~·, he proceeded to San Rafael, in which viciuity he proposed to begiu field operations. During the period (ornr thirty years) that had elapsed since the surrny made by Assistant Rodgers, many of the old stations had been lost. On the south side of the bay ouly one old sbttion was found, and on the north side, between Petaluma Creek and Mare falaud, not one. Hence a. new triangulation was needed to establish poiuts as a basis for topographical work. This triangulati<1n was doue as required for each successive topographical sheet. A 11umber of the stations being on mal'shy ground, they could not be deemed penuarnmt, and hence they were determined just in ad\·auce of the plane-taule survey. For the preservation of the most important of the marsh stations for topographic and hydrogl'aphic uses, th<>y wel'e marked by sections of earthen draiu pipes thirty inches long aud five inches in diameter. These were set perpendicularly with their flanges down wards and with several iuches of their length projecting above the surface. Among the positions determined were the beacon8 marking the course of the channel in San Pablo Bay to Petaluma Creek, both the old and the new oue8, the latter being made necessaQ· by the movement of the channel towards the east, a moYement whicl1 still continues. These bea~ous being well out in tile bay furnish excellent signals for hydrographic work. The topography was begun at l\fare Island Strait8, the town of Valle;jo and the ~fare Island navy-yard being included. It ~s evident that there had been no change in the contours since the former surveys, hence the time spent was devoted entirely to the delineation of the shore· line, wharves, jetties, landings, etc., with the buildings in the blocks in Vallejo immediately adjacent. On Mare Island all buildings, roads, and improvements existing at the time of the surrny were shown. Westward from Mare Islaud, towards Sonoma and Tolay Creeks, considerable change was found in the shore·lilte of the mansh from that shown in .Assistant Rodgers's survey. During a very heavy southerly storm a few ;;ears ago the shore·lil1e was washed away so that the sites of some of the old stations are now in the bay, one of them over one hundretl meters. From Sonoma Creek westward, including Tolay, Petaluma, and No\·ato Creeks, large fp1antities of the marsh have been reclaimed by dikes and ditches, and much of the land i8 now under cultivation. In the large creek~ as also in the small sloughs, marked chang-es have been made by the growth of the Elymus niaritima, which has encroached greatly on the Bay of San Pablo. At the month of Novato Creek and to the southward this growth has extended nearly a mile from the shore·line as reprf)sented in Mr. Rodgers's survey. The work of the season was closed April 23, 1887, in order not to exceed the amount allotted for the expenditures of the party to the end of the fiscal year.

Hydrographic resurveys in Suisun and Nan Pablo Bays, Karquines Straits, and vicinity.-The need of a revision of the hydrographic charts of San Francisco Harbor and the bays connecting with it has been perceived for some years past, causes having been actively at work to produce changes in the depths given by the old surveys. In September, 1886, the execution of this work was assigned to Lieut. David Peacock, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Hassler. Lieutenant Peacock's surveys are shown upon six projections, three of them upon a scale of 1-10000, and one upon a scale of 1-20000 for Suisun Bay, Karquines Straits and vicinity, and one of 1-10000 and one of 1-20000 for San Pablo Bay. Hydrographic work was begun September 28, 1886, and closed April 10, 1887, all that was laid out upon the projections having been finished except a portion of San Pablo Bay, to complete which about a month's additioual work will be required. The following-named officers were attached to the party on board the Ha,ssler: Ensigns J. H. Shipley, C. C. Marsh, D. P. Menefee, A. M. Bettcher, N. S. Moseley, and J. D. McDonald, U.S. N.; Passed .Assistant SurgMn D. 0. Lewis, U. S. N., and Passed .Assistant Engineer G. D. Strickland,. U. S.N.

The tabulations and the sheets of record, after examination by Mr. Davidson, were regularly transmitted to the Office. The usual meteorological record was also transmitted. Observations for time and comparisons of the tidal chronometer, whenever it was brought over from Sauoolito, were made by Mr. Charles B. Hill at the Lafayette Park station, San Francisco. The tidal record was unbroken and of uniform excellence during the year. It will be very desirable to obtain a record for a complete lunar cycle at this importamt station. Occupation of stations in San Francisro for wngitude determinations.-Dctermination of longitude at lialt Lake City and at Portland, Oregon.-Ma.gnetic observations at Portland.-In conformity with instructions, two parties for the 'determination of longitudes on the Pa<;ific coast and in Utah Ter- · ritory were organized in .April, 1887, by .Assistants Edwin Smith and C. H. Sinclair. After arranging all details in regard to instruments, three sets of which had been stored at Salt Lake City and at Ogden, Utah, at the close of the preceding season, .Assistant Smith arrived in San Francisco April 29, and Assistant Sinclair at Sa1t Lake City some days before. At San Francisco, iu conformity with instructions, Suba.ssistant Welker reported to Mr. Smith for duty in the longitude party. The observatory and transit instrument at Lafayette Park sta-

tion were placed at the disposal of the party by Assistant Davidson, and the longitude apparatus was at once put in position for the exchange of telegraphic signals. On the nights of May 4, 7, 9, 10, and 12, time was determined and longitude signals exchanged betweeu San Francisco and Salt Lake City; the observers then changed places, and similar exchanges were had on the nights of May 20, 25, 26, 2-;, and June 0. Mr. StJJith then proceeded to Portland, Oregon. During his stay at Salt Lake City, observa· . tions were begun to determine astronomically the difference of longitude between the J,afayette Park station in San Francisco ancl the old station in Washington Square, which had been occupied in the transcontinental longitude campaign of 1869, and which bad been subsequently abandoned as an unfavorable locality. Permission having been obtained by Mr. Da,·idson from the city authorities for the re-occupation of the Washington Square station, Mr. Welker built a temporars obserrntory there, and on the nights of May 26 and 27, and June 3, 4, and 6, obser>ed for time and· exchanged longitude signals with Mr. Sinclair at Lafayette Park. The observers then changed places, and a second series of exchanges was obtained on the 11ights of June 7, 9, 10, 12, and 13. Upon l\lr. Smith's arrival at Portland he established a longitude station in the grounds of the custom-house. Time observations were made ancl longitn<le signals exchangerl between San Fraucisco and Portland on the nights of .Tune 20, 27, and 28, and continued after the close of the fiscal year. The foggy season began unusually early this year at San Francisco. Had the weather been favorallle one-half of the longitude nights could have been had before July 1. At Portland, during four days in June, l\Ir. Smith made observations for the determination of the magnetic deciination, horizontal aml total forct>, and dip. He expresses cordial acknowledgments for ever-ready and liberal co·operation to the Western Union Telegraph Compan.1 in extending tlie use of their Jines to the longitude parties. Mr. Sinclair, in his report, refers to the uiligence and intelligence shown by Mr. \"elker in taking hold of the longitude work without previous experience in it. Other service of a similar characwr, assigned to Messrs. Smith and Sinclair, is referred to under the heading of Section XVI. SECTION XI.

Hydrographic sun'C!J of the Umpquah Rfr·er, Oregon, and its approaches completed.-TopagrapM· cal BUl"l)ey of the coast of Oregon conti.nued from Umpquah River southward.-In continuation of the hydrogr<tphy of the Umpquah River, Oregon, alread~· begun by Assistant L.A. Sengteller, that officer took the field in pursuance of instructions in August, 1886, landing with his party at Empire Uity, Koos County, Oregon, August 17. From this point, through the kindness of Capt. Robert Simpson, owner of the steam·tugs at Koos Bay, he was enabled to obtain transportation to Gardiner, on the Umpquah River, just below whiell the work of the preceding season had been closed. A temporary camp having been established near the mouth of tbe river, the work of recm·ering and re-m·ecting signals aml establishing new stations for signals was a.t ouce begun, and a tidegauge set up, at which observations were commenced August 20, and continued without iuterrup· tion, so as to include all high and low waters between that date and September 2. Soundings were begun below Gardiner Angus~ 23 and contiuued till September 7, wheu t!Je work had reached to nearly the mouth of the river. There remained then only the bar and its dangerous approaches, botli outside and inside, to complete the liydrogra.phic survey. . Having transferred the party from its temporary camp to a location near the mouth of the river so that he would be enabled to take advantage of favorable opportunities for tbe survey of the bar and approaches, or for carrying forward the topography from the mouth sou th ward, l\'f r. Sengteller advanced both surveys simultaneously from September 10 till the close of the season, November 6. The survey of the bar proved to be a slow and hazardous work; it was only for an hour before and after low water that satisfactory results could be obtained, as at high water, owing to the rough

sea and in a current of about, five knots, the boat, which was short-handed. having but three men instead of six, her complement, could not be kept on her course. Mr. Sengteller succeeded, however, in enlisting the interest of the captain of on~ of the steam-tugs, the Fearless, in the survey, and through his courtesy a few hours' so1rndings were obtained during the prevalence of spring tides with high water occurriug iu the middle of the day. Between 9 a. m. and 5.30 p. m. of September 28, the bar was 8uccessfully examined and sounded before and after high witter, thus completing all data required for the publict?,tion of a chart of Umpquah River from its entrance to Gardiner City, which is J>ractieally the head of ship navigation. Mr. Sengteller obscrYes that his examination of the bar deYeloped a cliannel quite narrow and contracted, bnt for only a short distance; affordiug full tweh-e feet at the lowest of low waters, and that this entrance, as compared with many on the Pacific coast, possesses one great advantage to vessels entering or departing iu that they either go with, or head, the seas and swells, and while the channel may shift daily, its general trend and depth baye remained quite uniform during, his four years' serYice in that section. Sailing dimctiom1 and descriptions of dangers to the navigation of the river are given in much detail iu Mr. Sengteller's report. Ile renews llis recommendation for the buoyage of the river. In the development of the topography from the Umpquah River southward, the country passed ·over presented a formation of sand hills and hollows of the most irregular shapes, daily shifting in accordance with the prevalence of the. winds. This drifting sand, during high winds, made plane-table work quite difficult, the instrument and :sheet being coYered with it. A belt of topography about five miles in length and having an average width of a mile and a half had been finished at the end of the S('ason. For tlrn topography the statistics are: Miles of ocean shore-line surrn_yed .. _........ - ......... _............ _... 5 Miles of shore-line of creeks surveyed ............ _.. _...... _.. . , .... _... _. _.. 1 Miles of shore· line of lakes surveyed ...... _. . _................... _.. _. _.. . . . _ 5 Area surveyed, in square miles .. __ ......... _..... _.. _._ ..... _...... ___ ... _ .. _. 8 Mr. Sengteller had the aid during the season of Mr. J. K. Moffitt, who served very acceptably as recorJer in the party. Mr. Moffitt was relieved from duty upon returning from the field, and the reduction of th~ observations and preparation of the records devolved upon Mr. Sengteller, whose report shows a very large amount of office work ace omplished and transmitted for registry in the archives. Topographical reconnaissance of the coast of Oregon between the Umpq1iah a-nd Yaquina Rii1ers.As preliminary to a more detailed survey, a topographical reconnaissance of the coast of Oregon hetween the mouths of the Umpqnah and Yaquina Rivers was assigned to Assistant E. F. Dickins on his detachment from the party of Assistant Davidson in April, 1887. It was desired to obtain on a scale of l-!0000 the shore-line, some heights, landfalls, and sketches of bluffs. The positions of all dangers, rocks off shore-their heights and peculiarities of shape-were to be note(l for immediate requirements. Provisfon was made for checking the direction of the work by observations of the sun for azimuth; observations were also to be made at suitable intervals for ti cue and latitude, approximate determinations only being required. Having made all Ileedeil preparations, Mr. Dickins organized his party May 17, and reached Gardiner, on the Umpqnah River, May 25. Here some delay wa.s encountered owing to the difficulty of obtaining pack animals. On June 4 work was begun at Five Mile Creek, and from that date the reconnaissance wa8 pushed as rapidly as the weather would permit. High winds and dense fogs prevailed most of the time; the count.ry was rough and unsettled and the trails poor, so that the ontfit of the partj· had 1:o be made as light as possible. By June 30 Heceta Head had been reached, nearly one-half of t11e reconnaissance done, and the first plane-table sheet completed.

Topographical reconnaissance of the coast of Oregon between Yaqu inn River and Tillamook Bay.In April, 1887, Assistant Cleveland Rockwell was directed to execute a topographical reconnaissance on the coast of Oregon between Yaquina River and Tillamook Bay, intended to subsene the same purposes as the reconnaissance referred to under the preceding heading, which was assigned to Assistant Dickins. !fr. Rockwell has submitted a very full report of this work, accompanied by a carefully prepared progress sketch on a scale of 1-100000, upon which are given the names of tlie capes, creeks, bays, and other topographical features delineated iu his survey. A list of common names and of Iuuiau names corresponding (Tillamook language) is appended. An abstract only of this interesti11g report can be here given. The party was established in temporary camp No. l, north of Yaquina Point, May 18. Through the kindness of Mr. 'Vadsworth, agent for the Siletz Reservation, pack-horses were obtained from the Siletz Indians, an<l work was begun from the limits of the topography executed h.Y .Assistants Chase and Forney half a mile north of Cape Foulweather Light. Observations for time and azimuth were made at a station eccentric to the Light. The latitn<le had been determined in 1883 by Mr. Fremont Morse. Mr. ltockwell observes that the Cape Foulweather Light-house is not on that cape, the miudle anu most prominent part of which is about eight and a half miles north of the Light. 'The work made fair progress during the first month, the weather heing moderately good, and a narrow strip of coast near the water, generally bare of trees ::m<l covered with grass and fern, extending for seven miles from Cape Foulweather, being favorable for using the plane table. Indentations iu the coast-line, which migl1t have taken days of hanl labor to get around !Jy the trails, were meiisnred by a telemeter rod which Mr. Rockwell bad made of extra length, capable of being read to five hundred and sixty meters. On June 11 the work had been advanced to Siletz Bay, anu obsen'ations for time aud azimuth were again made. By the 27th of' June the survey hatl beeu completed arouml Devil's Lake aud Salmon River, and camp No. 8 had been pitched on top of Cascade Head, thirteeu huudred foet above the sea-level. At this point the limit of the first topogra1ihical sheet (seale 1-'10000) was reached. Auditional details of the work accomplished must be reserved for the next annual report. 1 .rhis survey was prosecuted by Mr. Rockwell to a successful conclusion despite rnauy se1fous obstacles encountered during its pr~gress. The following extracts from his report will indicate their character : "The difficulties of the weather and of the work together seemeu at times absolutely iu!mr· mountable. By reason of the contraction of tbe reservation limits, the trails had been long siuce abandoned by the Indians, and were overgrown with thick bushes and obstructed by large fallen dead trees ou the steep sides of ravines. The brush had to be cut away and fallen trees bridged over with chunks of rotten logs so as to get the pack animals through. Other large trees, iu mauy cases, had to be chopped away or the ground dug out from unuerneath to allow the packs to pass under. The trail would follow the steep ridges to their tops, eight hundred or a thousand feet high, and then descend into a gorge nearly at sea-level; then would ascend to the top of the next ridge.
"On some of the capes, which are not covered with timber, the points appear to be delightful grassy slopes when viewed from a distance. This appearance is, however, deceptive; the salmonberry and sallal bushes are a matted mass of stalks and verdure from eight to twelve feet high, out of which nothing but the sky is visible. A. running vine, the old-man root, binds the whole mass together. At one station a bear, alarmed by the men a short distance off, ran around below the plane table not twenty feet away, but he could not have been seen ten feet. away."

and in'Washington Territory were assigned in Mitrch, 1887, to the charge of Lieut. J.C. Burnett, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer JJ1cArthur. The McArthur, haYiug been fitted for work on that stormy coast, left San Francisco April 26 and arrived off Tillamook Bay May l. The bar being too rough to be crossed, and there being every indication of bad weather, it was thought best to stand on to Astoria for shelter. From the 2d till the 11th of .May strong gales, with heavy rain, prerniled, and detained the vessel in llort; but on the afternoon of the 1 lth, the gales having abated, she arrived iu Tillamook Bay, and next day the erection of signals was begun. All of the sounding':l needed for work inside the bay were obtained betwe~n the 14th and 18th. From the 18th to the 20th the bar was breaking heaYily and the steamer could. not get outside. On the 21st, the sea having moderated, the bar was crossed and the offshore work begun. This was practically finished on the 26th, and from that date till the ::nst the Me.Arthur was steaming on and off the entrance, waiting for the sea to moderate enough to permit the boats to run additional lines across the bar. No opportunity of doing this part of the work having otlere<l by the 31st, and the supply of coal getting· low, Lieutenant Burnett returned to Astoria. He obsenes that except under the most fa\·orable c@ditions the bar at Tillamook is Yery dangerous, and that during the nineteen days' stay of the party the ship's boats were able to cross it but once. Enough work was done, however, to sl10w what changes may have taken place since the former survey. Nehalem River was the next locality proposed to be examined, but it was found impossible to get into it. On the calmest day the sea broke with great fur;y clear across the entrance. The boats were close in, and the depth on the bar was estimated to be not oYer four feet. Having taken on board coal and water, the llfcArtlwr left Astoria for Sl10alwater Bay on the morning of June 6, arriYing at North CoYe the same afternoon. Signals were _at once put up, a tide-gauge established, and on the 9th soumlings were begun. Strong tides preyai!ed in this bay, against which the boats could make but little headway. The survey bad made sufficient progress, however, by the close of the fiscal ;year to asrsnre its completion in less than two weeks from that time. Further notice of this work and of that off the coast between Shoal water ·Bay and Gray's Harbor must be deferred till the next annual report. 'l'he officers attached to the party were Ensigns W. P. White, J. A. Bell, and .T. L. Purcell, U. S. N.; .Assistant Surgeon E. W. Anzai, U. S. N., and Assistant Engineer R. I. Reid, U. S. N. Ensign N. S. l\foseley, U. S. N., joined the party May 21.

Assistant Cleveland Rockwell had been assigned to duty in Mr. Davidson's party. In July, 1886, l\Ir. Davidson occupied station Rainier, on the left bank of the Columbia River, opposite the mouth of the Cowlitz River, to check the latitude and azimuth of the Columbia, River triangulation, and to serYe as a basis for the triangulation already laid out between that river and Puget Sound. The secondary triangulation station, Rinearson, Oregon, was used as an azimuth mark. During the regular astronomical work, advantage was taken of cloudy wea~her to occupy an eccentric magnetic station for observations of the magnetic declination and horizontal force. Work at Rainier was finished about the 24th of July.

parties on the Pacific coast, he gave detailed instructions to Mr. Rockwell for the execution of general instructions received by that officer in September to resume the survey of the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. The portion of the work most needed was taken up by :Mr. Rockwell, tlie hydrography of the Columbia from Columbia City to the head of Bachelor's Island. Hadng assumed charge of the party September 17, soundings were begun on the 25th, and continued assiduously titl the completion of the hydrography on the flth of November. The chief delays _encountered were from the morning fogs, which did not generally disappear before half-past ten a. m., and sometimes lasted till noon. The main portion of the Columbia River was surveyed by the usual system of recta.ngular lines or sqllares, about one hundrt>d and twenty meters apart, divided in some places into half that space. A large part of the ·wmamette Slough, part of Lewis River and of Lake River and Bachelor's Island Slough, fell upon the same bydrograpbic sheet, aud these streams were sounded by a system of zigzag lines which, in l.\fr. Rockwell's judgment, was a sufficient development. Tides for the reduction of the soundings were observed at Saint Helen.

Determination of longitude and the magnetic elements at Portland, Oregon.-An account was given under a beading in Section X of the occupation of a station in Portland, Oregon, for the determination of its longitude by exchanges of telegraphic signal;; with the Lafayette Park station in San Francisco. The station at Portland was established b;r Assistant Ed win Smith, in charge of one of the longitude parties, and tlle exchanges of signals with Assistant C. H. Sinclair at Sau Francisco, which had been begun June 2-0, were still in progress at the close of the fiscal year. The magnetic elements were determiued by Mr. Smith at Portland duriug four days in June. Other longitude operations, conducted by Messrs. Smitli and Sinclair, are referred to under headings in Sections X and XVI. Beach measurement and topographfoal survey between Shoalimtcr Bay and Gray's Hm·bor, coast of Washington Territory.-Special triangulation and topography at Tacoma atHl Seattle, Pu[!et 80111111, Washington Territory.-At the date of closing the last annual report, Assistant S. A. Gilbert lrnll begun a beach measurement and plane-table survey on the coast of vVashington Territory from Shoal water Bay northward to and including the entrance to Gray's Harbor. Preparation for this work was made by .isetting up stakes along the beach, beginning at the limit of triangulation completed in a former surrny, about five miles north of Shoal water Bay, and extending around into Gray's Harbor. 'l'he distanceR between these stakes were very carefully measured with a hundred-meter chain, which bad been used on the Yolo Base and its length tested there. The positions of the stakes were determined by a plane.table triangulation, and the topography carried across Gray's Harbor entrance. On July 10, 1886, the survey was finished, and by August 16, dllring intervals of other field duty, Mr. Gilbert had inked his topographical sheet of Gray's Harbor, made tracings of it, and forwarded one tracing, together with the original, to the Office. Between the 15th and 29th of July, Mr. Gilbert was at Tacoma, Wash., whither he had proceeded under instructions to make a survey of the city water front. Upon completing this work he took up a similar survey for the city of Seattle, anrl finished it August 13. The next duty assigned to him was the resumption of the triangulation and topography of Rosario Strait, and subsequently similar work in Bellingham Bay, both of tllese bodies of water forming parts of the a11proaches to or connections with Washington Sound. Mention of these surveys will be made under a later heading in this section.

Reconnaissance of the coa;Jt of lVashington Territory, from Gray'.~ Harbor to Cape Flattery.Instructions having been received towards the end of April, 1887, by Assistant .J. F. Pratt, directing him to organize a party for a reconnaissance of the coast of Washington Territory between Gray's Harbor and Cape Flattery, preparations for the work were begun without 1lelay. In these preparations Subassistant Fremont Morse, wlio had been assigucd to duty in the party, ren· derc>d a irl. As the outside coast was not inhabited by white men, it was necessary to organize the party at some point where it would be convenient to disband it on completing the survey, and Olympia was selected as the most convenient in every respect. By the 29th of April, transportation was obtained for the party to the coast, a team having been hired for the purpose, but the roads were in such poor condition that all hands were obliged to walk the greater part of the way. At Montezuno a small steamer was procured, which landed the party at Damon's Point, Gray'i,; Harbor, May 1. The weather was very stormy, and so continued for ten successive days, with but short lnlls. Attempb1 to begin work in the rain and sleet, which were almost continuou8, resulted in one of the men becoming disabled by rheumatism, and the organization haYing been origina1ly one man short, and it being impracticable to get more nwn, the work was carried all the way through short-handed. This imposed much additional labor upon Messrs. Pratt and Morse. · After the 11th of May, when active operations were resumed, 1he survey was pushed forward, with but two days' interruption from fog and rain, until Neah Bay was reached, on the night of June 13. On the 16th the party arrived at Olympia and was disbanded. It was desired to obtain observations for latitude and azimuth at the outset of the work at Damon's Point, but this was found impracticable on account of clouds. Time and latitude were ohserved at Quinaielt, an Indian village about three miles north of Poiut GrenviUe, but observations for azimuth were prevented by clouds. At Quillibute, still further north, a similar attempt was made, but was frustrated by clouds. From Damon's Point to Point Grenville the distance was measured with a one-hundred meter steel wire, aml the terminals of these wire bases were occupied with a theodolite. Beyond Point Grenville the distances depend on telemeter measurements, the relation in distance of the ocular micrometer to the plane-table alidade having beeu carefully determined. Much of the topographical detail was sketched. At feasible poiuts, angles were measured with the theodolite on conspicuous ohjects, stations being occupied as near to these objects as practicable. Outfit and supplies for the party were moved as fo11ows: ~,rom Damon's Point to the Quinaielt Indian .Agency by wagon; thence to the mouth of the Queets River, a distance of about thirteen miles, on the backs of klootchmen (Indian squaws). From the Queets to the Hoh River by Indian

The po~ition of the work depends, at the north end, upon the latitude of Ncah Bay and the longitude of Tatoosh Island; at the south end upon the position of station Lone Fir, as measured from a tracing of the topography of the entrance to Gray's Harbor by Assistant Gilbert in 1886. .:\'Ir.

At the outset of the fiscal year .Mr. Pratt was assigned to <luty in Saratoga Passa.ge, Port Smm.n, and vicinity, a report of which he has transmitted. An abstract is given under a subsequent heading in this section. Hydrographic sttrveys iii Admiralty Inlet, Port Townsend Bay, Possession Sound, and Port Sitsan.At the opening of the season in 18SG, Lieut. 0. F. Forse, U.S. N., Assistant Coast Surrny, ha dug recei rnd the neces..,ary instructions, made preparations for resuming tile IJ.rdrograplly of Admiralty Inlet and the waters adjacent. After having had the steam-launch Tarry-not fitted for service, he organized his party 011 board the schooner Earnest, and proceeded \\-'ith the two vessels to Port Ludlow, whence on April 24 he moved to an anchorage at the head of Oak Bay. Here a tide-staff was set up and observations begun. The weatht.r was yet unfiworable for the work, blowing and raining frequently. For the survey of Admiralty Inlet and Port Townsend Bay, Lieutenant Forse was furnished with a projection, scale 1-20000. On May 28, the schooner was moved to an anchorage on the west side of Port Townsellll Bay, and a tide gauge was set up there. In connection with this surrny, the rock off Foul weather Bluff was re-located accurately, a number of radial lines being run out from it to deep wa.ter, anu the vicinity thoroughly developed. The rock lies well in-shore, and is not apt to he a danger to navigation. Iiientenant Forse observes that the tidal current in .Admiralty Inlet is \ery strong, both during flood and ebb. Heavy tide-rips are met with from .Admiralty Head to Marrowstone Point, and with a fresh breeze there is usually a heavy sea at this point. Iu Admiralty Bay, the current . alongshore sets nearly always towards .Admiralty I.lead. In this hay there is a shoal known to fishermen as the Halibut Bank, on which the shoalest water found was thirteen fathoms. .Allwiralty Inlet, from Foul weather Bluff to Admiralty Head, contains no good anchorage. Port Towuseud Bay is entirely free from dangers and has good anchorage throughout its whole extent. Tile survey in these localities having been completed June 23, Lieutenant Forse left Port Townsend on the 25th and proceeded to Possession Sound, haviug received a pr~jection for the work there, scale 1-20000, from the suboffioo iu San Francisco. On June 30 he au chored at Ttilalip and set up a tide-gauge. Sounding was begun on July 6. During July and August the work was greatly interfered with by smoke, which at times was so thick that the wharf at Tulalip, le!!s than a quarter of a mile away, could not be seen from the schooner. During the preva· Jenee of this smoke the signals in Port Susan were built. The hydrograpby of Possession Sound was finished September 1. This sountl contains 110 important dangers except the extensive fiats at the mouth of the Snohomish River and a sandy shoal extending out from the south encl of Gedney Island. The shores are generally fiat for a short distance and then drop suddenly into deep water. Tulalip Bay is a safe anchorage for small craft, but it is said to be fast filling up. There is a rock in the entra.noo to this bay which Lieutenant Forse recommends should be marked by a buoy.

74

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

He marked it by a wooden buoy, anchored by a rope and a weight, but this, as he observes, can not be considered as at all permanent. For the hydrography of Port Susan, which was begun August 23 and completed October 13, a projection, scale 1-20000, was furnished by Assistant Pratt, who had executed the triangulation and topography in that vicinity. With regard to Port Susan, Lieutenant Forse remarks that the flats at its head are very extensive, and could be worked over only at or near high water. They constitute the only obstacle to navigation in Port Susan. The entrance to the Stillaguamish River is very shoal, and can be used only at high tide, even by the light-draught stern-wheel steamers. The soundings taken in the river were reduced to the low water of the day on which the work was done. Tbc tide in this river was found to be quite different from that in Port Susan, but it was not deemed advisable to spend the time which would have been required to obtain for it a separate plane of reference. On the receipt of instructions which left the' time of closing work to Lieutenant Forse's discr.etion, he proceeded to Olympia October 27, and laid up the Earnest in winter quarters in Butler's Cove. Lieut. H. T. J\Iayo, U.S. N., was attached to the party during the season.

Triangulation a1id topograpliy of Port Susan, Stillaguamish Biver, and Saratoga Passage, Washington Territory.-In accordance with telegraphie instruetions dated Jnne 29, 1886, Assistant J. F. Pratt began preparations for field duty in Port Susan, Saratoga Passage, and vicinity, ·washington Territory. The schooner Yukon having been overhauled and fitted for service, Mr. Pratt left without delay for the working ground, arriving at Port Snsan, after some detention by calms and light winds, on the 16th of July. Triangulation and ·topography were resumed in Port Susau from the limits of the survey of the preceding season. The triangulation was carried through to Skagit Bay, where, for the purpose of checking it, a connection can be made next season with the triangulation carried arnund on the west side of Camano Island by way of Saratoga Passage. The topography was carried over the same ground, aud also up the Stillaguamish River to where Hat Slough branches off'. On October 8, Port Susan and its tributaries were completed, and the party was then transferred to Saratoga Passage, taking up the work from tlle limits of the season of 1885 and continuing it until the entrance to Holmes Harbor had been reached. Early in November field operations were closed, and about the middle of the month the Yukon reached Budd's Inlet, where she was dismantled and laid up for the winter.

Triangulation and topography of Rosario Strait and vicinity.-Triangulation and topography begun in Samish a-nd Bellingham Bays, Washingt-On Territory.-Upou the completion of the special survey at Seattle, referred to under a previous heading in thii,; section, Assistant J. J. Gilbert, acting under instructions already received, immediately prepared the steam-launch Fuca for service, arnl proceeded to Rosario Strait to resume the triang111ation and topography of that strait and viciuit~-. On August 25, 18867 he was ready for field-work.

During tbe winter Mr. Gilbert was occupied in office work. Ou March 2fi, having received instructions to resume field-work, he made immediate preparations for proceeding in tlte steam. launch to Bellingham Bay. The repairs and refitting of the Fuca, including new smoke-stack arnl grate-bars, occupied the time till April 14. On the following evening l\fr. Gilbert established his camp on Chuckanut Bay, on the eastern side of Bellingham Bay, and on the 21st. began field-work. During April, l\fay, and much of June the weather was storms and very strong gales were prevalent, compelling the removal of the camp to a more sheltered locality. The topograpl!y was taken up l\fay 12, two sheets having been pr~jected, each on a scale of 1-10000. At the close of the fiscal .rear both triangtllatiou and topography were in active progress. Further reference to Mr. Gilbert's work in this locality will be made in the next annual report. SECTION XII.

Continuation of the survey of the coast, bays, straits, and harbors of southeastern Alaska.-At the beginning of the fiscal year the hydrographic parties nnder charge of Lieut. Commarnlcr A. S. Snow, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, commanding the steamer Patterson, had been at work since early in May, 1886, in the vicinity of Fort Wrangell, Wrangell Island, and in Sumner Strnit, southeastern Alaska. Liciutenant-Commander Snow bad taken the immediate direction of the work at Fort Wrangell and in the vicinity, and had assigned the work in Sumner Strait to tlJC cl!arge of Lieut_ James M. Helm, U.S. N., Assis~ant Coast Survey, commanding the steamer ,lfcArthur, Lieutenant Helm reporting progress to Lieutenant-Commander Snow every week or ten days. The steam-launch Lively was attached to Lieutenant Helm's command. Until June 21 the Patterson remained at Fort Wrangell, where tides were observed day and night through one lunation. The work of triangulation and topography, sounding, etc., was carried to a distance of about twenty-five miles from this point. On June 21, Lieutenant-Commander Snow mo...-ed the Patterson to Steamer Bay, on the west side of Etolin Island, where a tide-gauge was established which was connected with that at Fort ·wrangell by simultaneous observations, and the work was now carried on from this point until data had been obtained for completing a harbor chart of Steamer Bay. The Patterson was then moved to Dewey Anchorage, a few miles above Port Onslow, Etolin Island. Tidal observations were taken and a special chart of this anchorage was completed. This work was all that remained to finish the hydrographic sheet, scale 1-80000, of Clarence Strait and vicinity, which was. accomplished August 14. By this time the party on board the McArthur had completed t.he survey of Sumner Strait. This work was begun by the measurement of a bat10 at Red Bay. Frnm this base were carried the

76

triangu,lation aml topography of the harbors of Red Bay, Chican, Port McArthur, and Port Protection. Four astronomical stations were established-Red Bay, Inner and Outer Obican, and Port l\foArth ur. In the hydrographic work was included the survey of Sumner Strait and tlie aujacent bays and harbors from Level Island and Poiut Colpoys ou the northward and eastward to Cape Decision and Cape Pole on the southward and westward. Tide-gauges were established at Red Bay and Chicau. The hy<lrographic sheet, scale 1-80000, was completed by August 15, at which date Lieutenant Hehn proceeded in the McArthur to Fort Wrangell, where he met the party on board the Patterxon. The combined parties, under the direction of Lieutenant-Commander Snow, then took up the survey of-Wrangell Straits, which connect Sumner Strait with Freuerick Sound. Aft.er the measurement of a base, the establishment of an astronomical station, and the location of a tide-gauge at a suitable locality, the McArthur was dispatched to the westward to obtain farther astronomical obserrntious at Sliakan (or Chicau), and subsequently Lieutenant Helm was directed to proceed to Fort Wrangell, obtain final observations for chronometer rates, and while there to send Ensign Purcell in the Lively to get soundings in the Eastern Passage, Blake Channel, and Bradfield Uanal. This accomplished, he was to proceed with the 1l1cArthur to Dewey Anchorage, obtain astronomical observations there, an1l thence go to Fort Simpson, British Columbia, for final observations at that station, and while waiting the arrival of the Patterson, to carry out, if possible, the iustructiomi of the H~·drographic Inspector in relation to Cordova Bay, and to a reported rock at Fort Tougass. Bad weather made it impracticable to get the obser.-ations desiretl at Chican, or to do the work last referred to at Uordova Bay and Fort Tongass, but the other work was satisfactorily executed. Ou Sept.ember 12, having completed the survey of Wrangell Straits, Lieutenant-Commander Snow got under way and :,.;teame<l to Fort Wrangell, where he made search, but without success, for Saranac Rock, which had been very imleiinitely located by old charts off the north end of W oronoffski Island. N-0thing could be learned regarding this rock from the natives or from the residents of Fort Wrangell. On September 15, the Patterson having joined the McArthur at Fort Simpson, both vessels sailed for Port Townsend, and on the 22d for San Francisco, arriving September 28. Comparisons of chronometers were obt11.ined the same day at the Mare Island Observatory. The results of the season's work by the two parties under Lieutenant-Commander Snow's direction are shown upon the following-named hydrographic sheets, all of which lrnye been received at the Office: Clarence Strait ( 1-80000) aud adjoiniug cbanuels from Point Lemesurier to the mouth of Stikine River; Sumuer Strait (1-80000); Wrangell Strait, connecting Frederick Sound with Sumner Strait (1-30000); St.·John's Harbor, Zarembo Island (l-20000); Dewey Anchorage, Clarence Strait (1-20000); Ratz Harbor, Prince of Wales Island (1-10000); Coffman's Cove, Prince of Wales Island (1-10000); Etolin Harbor, Wrangell Isla11d (1-10000); Steamer Bay, Etolin Islanu (1-20000); Red Bay (1-10000); Shakan Straits (I-20000); Port Prot.ection (l-10000); and Port McArthur (1-10000). Tidal stations were establishe<l, as the work progressed, in localities most suitable for obtaining planes of reference for the soundings, tbe principal stations being at Fort Wrangell, St. John's Harbor, Steamer BaJ', Dewey A.ucliorage, Red Bay, and Chican. Lieutenant-Commander Snow observes that tbe tides follow the general law of the Pacific coast, and the mean of the lower low waters was taken as a plane of reference. Observations for strength of current were made frequently during the season. Much space is devoted in his report to statements in detail of tidal action in the straits and harbors surveyed, these being prefaced by the remark that the flood tide, as a rule, makes in from the large bodies of water, Sumner and Clarence Straits, and sets into tbe smaller bays, iuhits, antl channels. All of the operations incidental to a trigonometrical survey were executed by officers from the Patterson and McArthur, to whom special branches of the work had been assigned. Two baselines were measured b.r means of sounding wire Jed over tripods, stretched taut with large reels, and leveled with theodolites. Eight stations were occupied during the sea.son for the determination of time, latitude, and longitude. Every effort was made to keep the triangulation and topog-

rapby in advance of the by drograpby. AnglAs o{ elevation were taken to ali prominent peaks. The shores in tbe vicinity of Fort Wrangell, Steamer Bay, Dewey Anchorage, St. John's Harbor, and all of Wrangell Straits were put in with the plane table; the n·main<ler of the coast-line was ruu in by a modification of Fillmore's method (see pp. 138, 134, Ooast aud Geodetic Survey Rt'port for 1884), the sheet being mounted on a plane table iu the launch, and the patent log and sextants used. The astronomical observations were made by Ensign C. 0. Marsh, U. S. N., who took also a leading part in the measurement of the base-lines. In the party ou board the Patterson, Eusign A. P. Niblack, U. S. N., was assigned to the charge of the triangulation. A large number of Rtations were rendered necessary in this work by the character of the country, the coasts being all thickly wooded to the water's edge and indented by numerous narrow channelR. Ensign D. P . .Menefee, U. S. N., had charge of the t.opographical work, assisted by Mr .·John McHenr,y, one of the draug·htsmen of' the Patterson; Mr.·J. 0. Stone, draughtsman, also occupied with the plane table a sufficient number of stations to tfotermine contours. For the hydrographic work, Lieut. D. Coffman, U.S. N., and Ensign T. G. Dewey, U. S. N., were specially detailed, with the aid of such other members of the part)· as could from time to time be spared. With the exception of Clarence Straits and Stikine Straits (iu part), sounded by the Patterson, all the hydrographic work was done in steam-launclteti, tlw boats being fitted with a small reel and register, so that wire could be used in sounding in deep water. To Ensign S. Cook, U. S. N., was assigned the charge of all work done by the McArthur; Ensign J. H. Shipley, U.S. N., was detailed for the main triangulation; Ensign J. A. Bell, U.S. N., was given charge of the harbor work; Ensign J. L. Purcell, U. S. N., was ordered to command the steam-launch Lively, and ditl all the souuding not done by the i;;hip for the hy<lrography of Smuner Strait. The triangulation and topographical work was divided betweeu Ensigns Shipley, Bell, and Purcell. Soon after the McArthur joined the Patterson in Wrangell Strait!', a::; already referred to, Ensigns Shipley and Bell were transferred from tlle Mc.4rthur to the Patterson, the former carry· iug on the triangulation of the straits, with Ensign Niblack awl Ensign Bell putting in that portion of t.he shores above the mud flat, the sontllern half being pnt in by l\Tr. Stone. To Lieutenant Helm, who was detached from the Surn·.r soon after the close of the season, Lieutenant-Commander Snow expresses his indebtedness for most efficient co-operation, and for many valuable suggestions in connection with the work. An interesting and valuable report on the characteristic fauna and flora of the region surveyed by the Patterson has heen submitted to Lieutenant-Commander SnmY b.\- Passed Assistant Snrgeon T. H.

Ensign Shipley having ha<l the misfortune to break his leg, was detached from the party June 18. Continuatfon of the serie.~ of tidal records obtained fr01n the automatic tide-gauge at Saint Paul, Kad1'.ak Ii;land, Alaska.-The series of tidal observations in the town of Saint Paul, Kadiak Island: Alaska, was continued by Fred. Sargent, observer, under the general supervision of Assistant Davidson. Mr. Sargent determines his own time. During the winter a short break in the series occurred, owing to the necessity of removing the pier to a new and safer location. unusually violent storms prevailed, in one of which the crib.work sustaining the gauge·house was wrecked and the clock injured. Assistant Da,·idson acknowledges valuable assistance rendered by the Alaska Commercial Company in the removal aml re-establishment of the tidal pier and house. He expresi:;es his obligations also to Mr. Ivan Petroff, Deputy Collector of cust-0ms at Saint Paul, for very acceptable aid rendered to tile observer. The usual meteorological record was forwarded by M:r. Sargent.

Transcontinental tria.n.1Julation near the thirty.ninth parallel, extended to tlte westward in Kentucky and Ohio.-l·'or the continuation of the transcontinental triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel in Kentucky and Ohio, Assistant A. T. Mosman took the field under instructions early in August, 188G. The progress of this work in 1886 till the close of field operations November 21, and the advance made in it in 1887 from its resumption iu May till the end of the fiscal year, are fully reported under the heading of Section XIV. Reconnaissance for the e.vtensiun westward of the transcontinental triangulation 1iear the thirty. ninth parallel in Kentncky and Ohio, and for its comiection icith the triangulation advancing to the east1card in Indiana.-Iu 1881 a reconuaissance for the extension to the eastward of the transcon· tinental triaugulation uear the tbirtj·-ninth parallel bad been closed in the vicinity of Bloomiugton, Ind., by Assistant F. \V. Perkins. The advance to the westward of the transcontinental triangulation in Kentucky and Uhio, and to the eastwaru of that in Iuuiana, made it desirable in 188G to push a reconnaissance in the three States just named, and Assistant Perkins was detailed for this <luty in August of that year. A report of his operations will be found under the heading of Section XIV. Geodetic operations.-Reconna.issarwe for the connection of tke triangulation of tke State of Tennessee with tke primary tr·iangulation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in northern Georgia.-Instructions issued in Ma;r, 188G, to Prof. A. H. Buchanan, Acting Assistant, to resume geodetic operations in the State of Teunessee hy beginning a reconnaissance for the extension of the triangula· tion westward from Nashville, m~re m1.>clified when additional funds became available for the work npon the passage of the Sundry Civil Expenses Act early in August, 1886. Upon the suggestion of Assistant C. 0. Boutelle, to whom ha<l been assigned the special charge of State surveys, Professor Buchanan was directed to transfer his party to the southeast.em part of the St.ate and take up a recounaissauce for obtaining a connection of his triangulation with the primary triangulation in Georgia which extends westward a.1Hl northward from the Atlanta base-line. Beginning his examinations iu the mountain region of Tennessee from the base-lines Deadening-Roy and Deaclening-Owen, about the middle of .August, Professor Buchanan succeeded eventually in overcoming the many difficulties incident to reconnaissance where the observer has to depend upon temporary means of transportation over poor roads and in a sparsely settled country, and by October 23, when field operations closed, had submitted a ~heme for the connection of the

triangulation in Tennessee with that in northern Georgia upon the lines Grassy-John's Mount and John's Mount-Gulf of the primary triangulation in the latter State. In May, 1887, he took the fiel(l under instructions to occupy stations selected during the season preceding. Commendable progress had been made at the close of the fiscal year, two stations, Deadening and Owen, having been occupied. With a continuation of fa.vorable weather Professor Buchanan hopes to complete the desired connection during the present surveying season. SECTION XIV.
OHIO, INDIANA, ILLINOIS, MICHIGAN, AND WISCONSIN. (SKETCHES Nos. 1, 14, 16, and 17.)

Transcontinental triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel extended to the westward in Ohio and KentuckJJ.-Reconnaissance for site of a base-line in Okio.-Instructions to take the field for the extension westward of the transcontinental triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel in Ohio and Kentucky, were sent to Assistant A. T. Mosman immediately after the passage of the appropriatfon act in August, 1886. Arriving at Cincinnati August 9, Mr. Mosman visited the Observatory to take a view of the country, and to get measurements on prominent points for use in making a connection between his triangulation and the Coast and Geodetic Survey longitncle station in the Observatory grounds. At the close of the previous season the reconnaissance had been extended to the line Ash Ridge-Minerva; the first-named point about nine miles northeast of Georgetown, Brown County, Ohio; the second about two miles in a southwesterly direction from Dover, Mason County, Ky. Proceeding from Cincinnati to Georgetown, and making on the way a general examination of the country along the Georgetown and Portsmouth Railroad, Mr. Mosman, on reaching Ash Ridge, reconnoitered the country from that :;;tation, and having directed his foreman in regard to the details of construction at Ash Ridge and Minerva of the signals required there, he went to Cave Hill to establish a station at that point, which is about five miles northwest of West Union, A(lams County, and then proceeded to Portsmouth, Ohio, where he or~anized his party for the occupation of the first station, Twin Creek, about fifteen miles to the west of Portsuwuth. Lines having been opened and heliotropers posted, observations were begun at Twin Creek August 27 and finished September 1. The following-named stations were then occupied in succession: Peach Mount, two miles from Mineral Springs, Adams County, Ohio; Cave Rill (the locality of which has been stated), and Cherry Ridge, about two and a half miles from Concord, Lewis County, Ky: Oberry Ridge is a sharp hill, ·over seven hundred feet above the Ohio River, and required for its occupation_ much difficult preliminary work, the observing tent, instruments, etc., having to be carried by hand from Concord. Observations at this station were completed October 20, the unusually short period of fifty-five days having sufficed for the occupation of four stations, owing to the generally favorable weather which prevailed during the season. In pursuance of instruct.ions dated October 9, directing a reconnaissan<>,e to be made near station Gould ih the Scioto Valley for a site for a base-line, the party was transferred to Franklin Furnace, Sciot-0 County, Ohio, towards the end of October~ and Mr. .Mosman took up an examination of the river-bottom land between Haverhill and vVheelersburgh in that county. Between these two places the Ohio Rfrer runs nearly north and is tolerably straight, the width of the bottom-land comprised between the foot-hills and the river bank varying from over a mile at Haverhill and Wheelersburgh to about oue quarter of a mile at Franklin Furnace. The conditions sought to be fulfilled by the site to be selected were, first, hard, firm ground, admitting of the placing of suitable monuments both under and abo'>e the surface, aml a locality not liable to disturbance from ordinary causes; second, a sufficient elevation of the ends above the flood-line of the Ohio River; third, that the ends should be so located as to give the hest possible connection with the triangulation; and fourth, that the length of the line should be about fonr miles. These conditions were met as nearly as practicable by the selection of a site south of Chandler's :Run, a creek which enters the river at the ~arrow part of the bottom-land. This line would

have a length of five thousand nine hundred and twenty-three meters or three and sixty-seven onehundn·dtlis miles; both ends occupy positions above the highest point e\'er reached by floods in the Ohio River and upon sites which can be secured from disturbance. The line was chained and stakes driven every twenty meters, and levels were taken on every stake, these levels being referre<l both to the leyc] of tlrn river at the time, and to its highest known level-the flood-line of 1884. Mr. Mosman has sulnnittetl with his report a sketch showing the location of this line, which Le has named the Haverhill Base, and showing also its proposed connection witli t,Lw triangulation, its topography and its profile. Ile gives also the location of atl alternate liuc aJongsitle J:he Scioto Valley Railroad north of Chandler's Run, and haYing a length of six thornmnd two hundred and eight~·-one meters or three miles and nine-tenths, but less favorably located than the Ila.nrbill Base_ to obtain a connection with the triangulation. Field operations were closed and the party disbanded on the 21st of November. Mr. ·w. B. Fairfield, extra observer, served with great acceptance throughout the season.

Reference to this duty has been further made under the heading ot Section II. In May, 181)7, having receivedjnstruct10ns to resume field-work for the extension westward of the transcontinental triangulation in Ohio and Kentucky, he proceeded to Cincinnati, and having selected a site for it signal one hundred and twenty-nine feet in height at station Tatei and also a site for a signal ninety feet in heigl1t at station Flaugher, Ky., he made preparations for the occupation of station Aeh Ridge, Ohio. Sites for signals were also selected at Dr.r Ridge, Ky. (ninety feet); one at Tanner, Ky. (one hundred ancl thirty-two feet.), and one of fifty-two feet in height at station Stevens, Ky. The building of these signals and posting the heliotropers at three 11tations occupied the time till .June 21, at which date the party was ready to observe at Ash Ridge. By the close of the fiscal year observations at this station had been nearly finished.
Reconnais.~ance near the thirty-ninth parallel for connecting the tramcontincntal triangulation in Ohio awl Kentucky witlt that in India·na.-Instructions having been issued to Assistant F. W. Per-

kins, towai·ds the close of .August, 1886, to resume the reconnaissance for the cpnnection of the transcontinental triangulations near the thirty-ninth parallel, the one advancing westward from stations in Ohio and Kentucky, the other eastward from stations in Indiana, .Mr. Perkins first determined a point in the vicinity of Bloomington, Ind., where be had closed his reconnaissance in 1881, and then took up work in Ohio and Kentucky. Ha>ing conferred by letter with Assistants Fairfield and Mosman in regard to the requirements of the work in their respective sections, Mr. Perkins deemed it advisable to have a p{'rsonal conf"t-re11ce with Mr. Mosmaa before beginning the eastern porti()n of the work, which was entirely new to him, and for that purpose visite<l him at his station, Peach :\fountain, near Mineral Springs, Ohio. Mr. Mosman's reconnaissance had been advanced to the line Ash Ridge-Minerva, two points about 17 miles apart, and lying from tbil:ty to forty miles east of the city of Cincinnati, the firstnamed point in Ohio and the last in Kentucky. Owing to unfavorable conditions of atmosphere in the vicinity of Cincinnati it was deemed advisable to carry the reconnaissance well to the southward of that city. On tlte Ohio side of the river there rise abrupt hills, back. of which is an exteqsive sligbtly-rolling table land, about nine

hundred feet above the sea-level, or about five hundred feet above the river. On the Kentucky side the same formation is di versified b,v deep creek valleys, which scar the surface in all directions, and which, when seen only in detail, give to the casual observer the impression of a hill country, but upon closer inspection the bills prove to be only partially-detached portions of a great level plain. The land is generally under a hi.gh state of cultivation, and the fertility of the soil is attested by the great height of many of the remaining forest trees, which not unfrequently measure from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty feet. Mr. Perkins strongly recommends the use of large revolving heliotropes in further reconnaissance in this or similar sections. Points for two figures were selected, carrying the work to stations about thirteen miles west of Cincinnati, Tanner and Hogan, both in Kentucky, and favorably located for the western extension of the scheme. The astronomical station at Falmouth, Pendleton County, Ky., can be connected with the work by means of points determined from the line Hogan-Flaugher, and with a little cutting it is believed that the Cincinnati Observatory can be seen from station Alexandria, and the line Alexandria-Tanner gives a good base for the determination of any second point that may be selected for this connection, and for the determination of public buildings in the city. Field-work was closed December 21, and a month later Mr. Perkins was iustructed to organize a party for service on the Gnlf coast. This work is referred to under the hea<ling of Section VIII in this report. Occupation of stati01is in Indiana for extendfng to the eastward the tran.~contincntal triangulation near the tkirty-ninth paraUel.-In pursuance of instructions issued at an early elate after funds for the work became available, Assistant George A. Fairfield was directed in August, 1886, to organize his party and proceed to the field in order to carry eastward iu the State of Indiana the transcontinental triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel from the limits of his work of the previous season. Upon his arrival at Vincennes September 2, Mr. Fairfield made arrangements for the immediate oceupation of station Wright, situated in the township of that name iu Gr.:ene County, about half way between the towns of Sullivan and Worthington, and about twelve miles from each. Linton, a small town on the narrow-gauge railroad from Sullivan to Bedford, is about nine miles south of the station. Night signal lights having been placed in position at the stations to be observed upon, observations were begun September 14- and finished on the 22d. Tents were then struck and camp moved, though not without delays from heavy rain-storms, to Calvary station, which is about twelve miles a little south of east of Worthington. Camp WM pitehed October 2. The signal at this station, ten feet and five tenths in height, bad been struck by lightning during the preceding summer and one of the corner-posts of the scaffold considerably shattered. Necessary repairs having been made, signal-lights posted, and lines opened to stations Sisson and Osborn, observations were begun, and continued whene\·er the weather would permit until October 30. The first snow of the season occurred on the 26th. By November 3 camp was moved to the last station occupied, Osborn, in McCameron township, in the northwesteru part of Martin County, and about fourteen miles north of Loogootee, a small town on the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad. Snow fell on the night of November 5 to a depth of four inches, and from that date till the end of the season the ground was covered with . snow varying in depth from one to fourteen inches. ..ttll preparations for observing had been completed by the 8th instant, but owing to bad weather no observations could be made until the 14th. By the 24th all of the observations that it was practicable to make at the station had been completed except abo11t three hours' work on one signal-light. It was not till the ui~ht of December 2 that this signal-light could be seen. The atmosphere had then become clear, with a temperature of four degrees above zero. One direction at Osborn, that to Rariden station, near Mitchell, Lawrence County, was left to be determined the next season, it having been found that the two stations were not intervisible by reason of some obstruction, the nature of which would have involved too great a prolongation of the season to ascertain in the then co~dition of the weather and the roads.

A few miles east of Rariden station is the second principal meridian of the system of surveys of the General Land Office. This meridian, Mr. Fairfield observes, it is important to connect with the triangulation, as was done with the third principal meridian, which was connected with the work at 8tnrgess station, near Vandalia, Ill. Subassistant F. H. Parsons was attacb.ed to the party during the season, and did his utmost to advance the work. He had special charge of placing in position the signal-lamps and of instructing the light-keepers. Mr. F. P. Ilacon served as recorder. Mr. E. E. Torrey, foreman, reported for service from Assistant Mosman's part,y September 16, and began at once the erection of a tripod and scaffold signal seventy-five feet in height at Rariden station. This signal was finished on the 28th, and the next day Mr. Torrey went with his men to Beard station, near Springville, Lawrence County, where be put up a similar signal eighty-eight feet in height. With the erection of another signal seventy-five feet high at Leonard station, seven miles west of Bloomington, Monroe County, Mr. Torrey finished this class of work, discharged his hands, and joined Mr. Fairfield in camp at Calvary station. Mr. Torrey's experience and skill make his services as foreman exceedingly valuable.

In April, 1887, having received instructions to take the field and resume work as early in May as be deemed practicable, Mr. Fairfield left Washington May 12 for Mitchell, Ind., accompanied by Mr. Parsons. Mr. \V. B. Fairfield, extra observer, reported at Mitchell a few days later. The first work to be done was to establish the direction of the line from O::iborn to Rariden, to determine the nature and position of the obstructions on the line, and then to remove them. To do this properly it was necessary to measure a few angles with the small theodolite at Rariden, Beard, and Leonard stations. Owing to a dense smoky atmosphere, these measurements were not finished till the 28th, when the direction having been computed was laid off from Osborn to Rariden. The part~· was then moved to Osborn station, and Mr. W. B. Fairfield was directed to clear the line. The trees in the way, some twenty or thirty in number, were readily disposed of, !Jut it was then found that a large barn forty by seventy feet right on the crest of a hill still obstructed the view. After much negotiation with the owner, he agreed for a comparatively moderate sum to cut a gap in the roof wide and deep enough t-0 allow tae signal light at Rariden to be seen~ and to keep it open till the observations at each eud of the line were finished. At Osborn station observations of horizontal directions, time, and azimuth were made, and were in progress, with but two nights' work needed to complete them, at the close of the fiscal year. The observations for horizontal tlirection and for azimuth were made by Mr. Fairfield, Mr. Parsons reading one micrometer, and in the azimuth observations marking time, while the records were kept by Mr. F. P. Bacon. For time Mr. Parsons observed, Mr. Bac,on recording. On June 13 Mr. W. B. Fairfield was detached to extend the reconnaissance to the eastward, and was still engaged on that work at the close of the fiscal year.

tion of the State of Imfouia having been authorized by instructions issued in May, 1886, to Prof. J. L. Cawpbell, Acting Assistaut, he took up that work in tlie following month from the line 0 and M-Haystack. While prosecuting the reconnaissance, be received on Jnne 19 instructions to close operations and disband his party by the end of the fiscal year, owing to tbe refusal of the House of Representatives to insert any appropriation for State surveys in the Sundry Civil Expenses Bill. After thi;,; a.ct.ion had been reconsidered and a small appropriation made in Augmit, Profossor Campbell was directed to resume operations, but on account of the lateness of the season and the pressure of other duties he felt impelled to ask for the detail of an officer of the Survey who would relieve l1i111 of the charge of tile party and continue the work. Assistant James B. Baylor was accordingly instructed towards the end of August to report to Professor Campbell for duty, aud upou his leaving the field to prosecute tlrn reconnaissance. After visiting the ~mveral stations with Professor Campbell, Mr. Baylor was left in charge of the work early in September. It hail reached that stage at which it was necessary to erect tripod and scaffolcl signals and open lines iu order to. carry the scheme forward. After suitable observing tripods had beeu put up at stations Haystack, Summit, and Bartle, and the pole replaced at 0 and ]f station, observations were begun by the occupation of Summit station in southern Indiana, near Henryville, Clark County. The quadrilateral figure, Haystack, Bartle, Summit, 0 and :u was closed; the line Bartle-Finley was opened, and a reconnaissance was maue for the location of a station Fairview, whicll, when definitely located, will give with Finley a base from which a connection can be had with the line Adams-Baughman of the transcontinental triangulation. In January, 1887, .Ati~istant Baylor was directed to take up a series of magnetic observations at southern stations. Reference to this duty hail been made under the headings of Sections III, IV, V, VJ, and VII. Continuation of geodetic operations in the State of Wisconsin.-A small balance of allotment having been foun<l available for work in Wisconsin during the month of Juue, 1886, Prof. J.E. Davie8, .Actiug A;;sistant, was instructe{l early in that month to resume the triangulation in the State from the limits of hit> work of the previ'Jus season. Ile had barely had time to begin operations, however, when it became necessary to direct him t-0 close all work by June 30, no appropriation haviug been recommended for State surveys in the bill as reported to Congress. Upon the final passage of the appropriation act, August 4, the action at first taken having been reconsidered, fnnds became available, but so late in the season that comparatively little progress could be made by Professor Da,·ies in carrying .out the instructions to arrange his work so as to provide a further connection with the triangulation of the Lake Survey at Minnesota Junction and to the north of it. Having taken up a reconnaissance eastward from Cambria, Columbia County, in order to get stations which should be seen from Reeseville, he found a high prairie plateau, along whicll the selection of such stations did not seem difficult. Fixing upon a point near Randolpli, Dodge County, he had about determined upon a scheme which coultl secure a connection with a station near Fox Lake and thence to Minnesota Junction, in one direction, and with the t>tations Arling· ton, Observatory Hill, and l!'itzsimmons in the other. But just at the time this seemed feasible, instructions were received, as before stated, to close work, and upon its resumption in August, the atmosphere being then full of dense smoke from frequent forest fires, Professor Davies decided to oooupy the high tripod built the preceding season at Lowell, near Reeseviilc, and make from there a reconnaissance which should give him the data for connecting in one figure Reeseville, Medina, Lebanon, and Delafield, these two last-named points being also stations of the Lake Survey. His. examinations satisfied him ultimately that for this figure be would be obliged w substitute the quatlrilateral Reeseville (or Lowell), Lebanon, Oakland, aml Delafield, so as to complete that, continuing, therefore, the occupation of Lowell, and then occupying Lebanon. · At Reeseville a local triangulation was made to connect the triangulation point with the two church spires which had been observed upon in 1884 from Oakland and Delafield. This was rendered necessary by an obstruction preventing direct vision between Lowell and Delafield. Observations were kept up until &ptember 8, though with grea.t difficulty, owing to the faintness

84

of the heliotropes as seen through the thick smoke. Night signal-lamps had been sent for, but arrived too late to be of service in contrilluting to the advance of the work. Professor Davies hopes that in the immediate future the work begun at a favorable period of the year, and carried forward witliout interruption throughout an entire season, will be brought to a. satisfactory close. Under instructions received in May, 1887, he placed bis party in the field on the 17th of that month, and was engaged iu rebuilding signals aml in the occupation of Reeseville up to the close of the fiscal year. He will extend his observations northerly to a further connection with the Lake Survey, and also toward a connection with the new triangulation about to be begun in the adjoining Stat.e of Minnesota.

Reconnaissance for the extension to the westward of the primary triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel in Kansa.s.-Tbe occupation of the stations Bebe Mound in Johnson County, and Eckman in Leavenworth County, Ka lls., by Assistant F. D. Granger in 1885, had brought the triangulation up to the limits of the reconnaissance of 1881, and had furnished ~base for the extension of the work to the westward. In August, 1886, Mr. Granger was instructed to organize his party for carrying the reconnaissance westward from this base. Before tlie reconnaissance could be begun, it was found necessary to rebuild the fifty-feet observing tripod and scaffold at Bebe Mound, which had been destroyed by a storm. The reconnaissance was then taken up, the outfit of the party consisting of a driver, one hand, and a covered wagon drawn by four horses. At the close of the 1ield 01)erations in December, the results obtained were very gratifying, nineteen new stations having been selected, and a practicable scheme of triangulation laid out., included in seven quadrilaterals, extending from stations near the ninety-fifth meridian to stations near the meridian of 970 30'. The heights of signals required at the stations selected will range from fifteen to fifty feet. During the winter Mr. Granger was employed on duty at. the Office, and in April, 1887, be re.organized his party, and began the work of signal building April 22. By June 22 eight tripod and scaffold signals had been erected. Station Bebe Mound was then re-occupied for observations upon the new stations to the westward, and at the close ·of the fiscal year but a few days' observations were needed to complete the station.

Bout.elle, in general charge of all the State surveys, was assigned to the duty of beginning operations in Minnesota, Professor Hoag being associated with Lim. These operations look first to a secondary triangillation of the Mississippi, at and near Saint Anthony's Falls, and also to the search for and selection of a site suitable for a base-line for the triangulation of the State. .A.t the close of the fiscal year they were in active progress.

Determination of the longitudes of stations in Ooforado and Utalt.-0/Jsen,ations for latitude and the magnetic elements.-The 1st of July, 1886, found the longitude parties in the field engaged in the dPtermiuatian of the difference of longitude between Colorado Springs and Gunnison, Colo., Assistant Edwin Smith being at Colorado Springs and Assistant 0. H. Sinclair at Gunnison. Four nights' exchanges had been obtained in June; the observers had then changed places, and in their new positions an exchange of signals for longitude had been ha(l June 30. Renee but three more nights were required t-0 complete tbe work between these points. These were obtained on July 2, 3, and 8. Mr. Sinclair then moved from Gunnison to Grand Junction, Colo. At Gunnison Mr. Smith <let.ermined the magnetic declination, dip, and horizontal and total intensity by observations on July 7, 8, and 9. The station at Grand Junction was established by l\fr. Sinclair i_n the public park. Ohsrrvations for time were made and si~nals exchanged for longitude het\n~en Colorado Springs and Grand Junction on the nights of July 15, 24, 26, and 27, after which the observers changed places, and similar observations were made on the nights of Jnly 30, 31, and August 4 and 5. At Grand Junction the latitude of the station was determined by Mr. Sinclair and the magnetic elements by Mr. Smith, by observations made July 31, August 2 and 3. Mr. Smith then moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, where be arriYed August 7. The station establishe(l here in the Temple Block by Assistant Dean in 1869 was found to be in excellent condition, the observatory and piers still standing. Unfavorable weather prevented excbauges of sig·nals between Salt Lake City and Colorado Spriugs for ten days after the parties were really. Five nights were obtained between August 19 and 28, and aftfir a change of stations by the observers, five more between September 2 and 6. While at Salt Lake Uity Mr. Smith visited Ogden, Utah, and examined the observatory established there by the United Stat.es Engineers. It was in a fair state of preservatiou, but, in .!\Ir. Smith's opinion, too inconveniently located to be used as a base station. Mr. Sinclair, who occupied the station later, expresses the opinion that as a central point for extending the longitude work in all directions Ogden bas advantages over Salt1111Lake City, as it is the terminus of a telegraphic division, possessing batteries and extra wires, such as can not be had at the latter point. On the completion of the work between Colorado Springs and Salt Lake City, all of the instruments and outfit were turned over to Mr. Sinclair, in conformity with instructions, and Mr. Smitll was relieved by Subassistant R. A. Marr, who took charge of the f.ltation at Ogden. T.Jollg-itmle signals were exchanged between Ogden and Salt Lake City on five consecutive night:;; hdm~en Sepoomber 12 and 16, and as soon as the observers changed stations five more consecutive nights were obtained between September 17 and 21. These exchanges finished the fiehl-work of the longitude parties in 1886. Duty in other localities assigned t-0 Messrs.

Ou the 7th of May he visited Nephi and the base of Mount Nebo, two miles np Willow Creek· Oafion, where, under the direction of his foreman, the first auxiliary camp was to be established. The plan for the work of the season contemplated the occupation of Mount Nebo as the first station. Mount Nebo has au altitude of twelrn thousand feet, and as the equinoctial storms had been unusually violent, the snow in the higher mountains at this time was mucli deeper than usual; ju fact, the slOJles of the mountain were solidly snow-capped for about three thousand feet from its summit down. This circumstance, together with the high winds, frosty nights, and occasional storms, during which the snow was driving as in midwinter and the thermometer at several degrees below the freezing point, proved to be a source of much delay and embarrassment. An obstacle yet more serious to the progress of the work, both at this time and later, resulted from the serious illness of the experienced aid, Mr. George F. Bird, contracted at Kansas City while on his way to report for duty. Mr. Bird had served most acceptably in the party during several seasons preceding, and the loss of his services was greatly felt. Under mtdical adYice lie withdrew from all field duty and subsequently resigned bis position in the Survey. Mr. J: fl, Turner, Aid, who was assigned in Mr. Bird's stead, reported in person at Nephi, June 6. On the 8th of June Mr. Turner proceeded to Mount Nebo, taking charge of matters there, and supen'ising and directing the establishment of camp near its summit. The difference of level between Willow Creek Camp, at the head of transportation by wagon, and the summit, was over five thousand feet, and the pack-trail, located and constructed by tlie party, was over five miles in length. Much heavy work had to be done by the party in repairiug and rendering passable for wagons about a mile and a half of washed-out roaJ, aud in openi11g up the pack-trail, the upper two miles of which lead over naked rock, partly sbattered and partly solid· Owing to the gradual thawing away of the snow, which in places was fouud to he full.)· fifteen feet deep, as, for example, at the very summit of the mountain, a thing never before experiencNl, tlie trail work never really ceased u·nrn late in June; hence the observations were delayed, it being the middle of June before the.r could be taken up. Yet, notwithstanding this, good progress had been made in the horizontal direction observations by the.close of the fiscal year, Yery fine weatht.'r prevailing for a time after observing began. Besides the work at Mount Nebo, the field-work included also the extension and perfection of the reconnaissance for the connecting net of the Salt Lake Ba.sin line, especially tlle examination of the lines which center at the stations Deseret and Onaqni. Mr. Eimbeek devoted wbat time could be spared from the pressing clemands of field-work to the preparation of a final report upon his Duplex Bage Apparatus. Field service performed hy him in the early part of the fiscal year is referred to under a heading in Section II.

Boutelle in August, 1886· that officer immediately applied himself to discover the condition of each work, what had been proposed and what bad been accomplished, with special reference to the question of direct connections with the work of the Coast and Geodetic SurYey proper. Finuiug that these connections had but seldom been kept in view as a definite object by the Acting Assis tauts, to whom had been entrusted the execution of the field-work, Mr. Boutelle made it his first endeavor to so direct the continuation of the surveys in each State as to bring them with as little ilelay as possihle into eonneetion with the coast or interior triangulation of the ~urvey. This accomplished, each one of the systems of triangulation in the several States would rest upon known and well-determined bases, and would form part of a general system, capable, even if temporarily suspended, of being taken up and carried forward in future yeitrs. The special report which Mr. Boutelle has made upon this subject submits plans for the continuation of the work in each State, enumerating the difficulties to be encountered and stating the most effective methods of overcoming them.

Verification and adjustment at the United States Mint, Philadelphia, of certain weights intenderl for use as standards in the San Francisco Mint.-Rec01nparison of the Star l'roy Pound of the Office of Construction of Standards of Weight and Measure with the Standard l'roy Pound of the Philadelphia Jl[fot.-A request having been made by the Director of the Miut for the services of the Office of Construction of Standards of Weight and Measure in the verification and adjustment at the United States Mint, Philadelpliia, of certain weights intended for use as standards iu the ~liut at San Francisco, Assistant .Andrew Braid was detailed by tlle Superintendent fur this duty with the approval of the Secretars of the Treasury. On .August 3 )Ir. Braitl proceeded to Phila<lelvhia, accompanied by Dr. J. J. Clark, Adjuster of Weights and Measures. Dr. W. P. Lawyer, Assayer of the Mint, was in attendance under the instructions of the Director, a8 the representative of the Mint, to witness the tests and verifications. · Mr. Braid's elaborate report shows that the closest attention was paid to evm·y detail that would insure accuracy. Means were taken to remedy slight defects found to exist in the large Standard Balance of the Mint, and to obtain an additional balance of a greater degree of sensitiveness; the methods of weighing were so arranged as to eliminate any sligLt inequalities that might exist in the weights of the right and left parts of eacli balance; to eliminate also any inaccuracy of adjustment of the balances or ans progressive change in the beams during weighings, due to expansion or contraction, and also any constant error due to unequal tlexnre of the two arms of the beam. The weighings were made in the room known as the Cabinet, and the standard pound of the Mint and the weights to be tested were always left together in the balance case over night so as to insure equality of comlitiou as to temperature, etc. No comparisons were made between the new weights and the Mint Standards of like denomination, as no record could be found showing the precise value of these standards. The Kater Pound (the Standard Troy Pound of the Mint) was therefore made the sole basis of comparison for the determination of the values of the new weights and their subsequent adju:stment aud verification. The weighings were made by Dr. J. J. Ulark and the reductions and computations by Mr. Braid. From four to six repetitions of the weighings were made in each instance, and the value of one division of the balance scale was determinM for each set. Upon the completion of the weighings and the computation of their result8, tl.te adjustments were then made by Dr. Olark by taking off from the bottom of each weight the amount necessary to bring it within the allowable limit of error. Re-weighings were then made and the results· placed on record. Advantage was taken of the present opportunity to make a re-comparison of the Star Troy Pound of this Office with the Mint Standard, the last comparison having been made in 1876. The result of a large number of weighings of the Star Pound with the Mint Standard indicated a less discrepancy between the two weights than in 1876 by about 0.012 gr. I>eterminations of latitude and gravity at stations on the Hawaiian Islands for the Ha1caiian Go11. ernment.-From the results of observations for latitude aud gravity made in June, 1883, at Honolulu, Oahu, and at Lahaina, Maui (Freycinet's station of 18Hl), by Subassistant E. D. Preston, on his detachment from the Eclipse Expedition, and from a comparison of these results with those of Captain Tupman, of the Bnglish Transit of Venus party, who had determined latitude in 1874, it appeared very desirable, both from a scientific and practical point of view, to determine a mu11 ber of astronomical latitudes at different points on these islands, where the great dcptll of the sea, tlw volcanic formation of the high mountains, and their distance from continental masses, furnish<·(l conditions presented hy no other locality on eartli for the study of the effects of gravity upou the direct.ion of the vertical. Subsequent correspondence on the subject between W. D . .Alexander, esq., Snperintendent of the Hawaiian Government Survey, and Mr. Presoon, and a personal conference between l\fr. Alexander and the Superintendent of the Survey in October, 1384, led ultimately to a request from the Hawaiian Government, received through its minister, Hon. H . .A. P. Carter, to the Superintendent of the Survey, for the detail of Mr. Presoon t,o make the observations for latitude and determinations of gravity required.

Mr. Preston's application for iliix months' leave of absence without pay having been approved by the Department, he left Washington in December, 1886, and arrived in Honolulu January 12, 1887, having with him the two-yard and meter Peirce pendulums Nos. 3 and 4. Pendulum No. 3 had been swung in 1883 at stations on the Caroline Islands, on the Hawaiian Islands, and at San Francisco, and final computations of results made by l\fr. Preston. Before leaving Washington he had prepared and tested this pendulum so that it should be ready for immediate transportation. The plan of his work contemplated a thorough study of the plumb-line deflections in the Hawaiian Islands for the Hawaiian Government, and to this were added later, determinations of gravity at the base and summit of Haleakala, the largest extinct volcano in the world, and also at Honolulu, for the sake of a better determination of the correction for elevation above sea-level, and also to connect the gravity work of the United States Ecli11se Expedition of 1883 with that of the present y6ar. For the latitude determinations he had with him meridian telescope No. 1. Between the 22d of January, when the work was begun, and the end of May, all of the stations occupied were for observations of latitude. The first was Ewa station~ Puuloa, near the mouth of Pearl River. The second was at Kahuku, on the windward side of Oalm. Observations here were completetl February 13. A preliminary reduction of results at this station showed a difference between the astronomical and geodetic latitudes of nearly a minute of arc, one of the most striking examples in the world of deflection of the plumb-line from mountain attraction. The time from February 22 t-0 April 2 was de'Voted to the island of Kauai, situated about eighty miles to the northwest of Oahu. On Kauai three latitude stations were occupied, two on the south and one on the north side. For the safe transportation of the instruments between the two eoutbern stationo;, W aimea and Koloa, it was necessary to reruove the eye-piece micrometer and latitude level from the telesco1le and carry them separately, the road being exceedingly rough and the cart of the most primitive kind. Honolulu was occupied for latitude between .April 3 and .April 12. Three stations on the island of Hawaii occupied the party till May 29. Kohala consumed a week only. But here the wind was the whole time so violent that li.ving in a tent was out of the question, and the party found 1011ging in an old sugar-shed. The station at Hilo, where the rain-fall is over sixteen foet a year, required nearly a month, and during that time only one good night for observations could be obtained. Observations were obtained on two other nights, partly clear, but it was not deemed advisable to wait for more favorable weather, as Mr. Preston was informed that the weather had been better than might be expected much of the time in Hilo. At Ka Lae the weather was passably favorable. The difficulties of obtaining water for cooking and drinking wece great. It had all to be carried on donkey back a distance of eight miles, part of the road being over the rough lava known as aa. Gravity was determined at Honolulu between June 1 and June U. Owing to bad weather and inaccessibility of stations, it was found impossible to finish the work originally contemplated within the time at first assigned; hence an extension of furlough for three months was granted to Mr. Preston, in order that the entire programme might be completed. This extended his leave to September 15, 1887. From June 14 to 22 Kailua, on Hawaii, was occupied for latitude, and from that date tiJI June 30 the party was occupying station Haiku, on the island of Maui, for determinations of latitude and gravity. Further account of the progress of this work will be given in the next annual report.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE.
The assignment of Assistant B. A. Colonna to duty in charge of the Office and Topography was continued throughout the year. Mr. Colonna's report of the Office operations, accompanied by the detailed reports of the chiefs of the several Office di visions, appears in Appendix No. 4 to this volume. In his summary of progress made during the year Mr. OoJonna refers to important information furnished in response to official requests from the Na.tiona.l a.ntl State Governments; mentions improvements introduced in varioW! branches of office and field-work; urges the great need of an

increase of force in the Computing, Drawing, Engraving, and Tidal Divisions, and the necessity for the appointment of a Disbursing Officer for the Survey, and expresses his high appreciation of the earnest support afforded him b~' the Assistants and others in charge of divisions in the Office. .A table of statistics of the field and office work of the Surrny during the fiscal year, with a summary of statistics to its close, appears in Appendix No. 2, and in Appendix No. 3 is given a tabular statement of information furnished in response to official requests, and to individualis upon application. The Computing Division remained, as heretofore, under the charge of Assistant Charle8 A. Schott. Valuable reports submitted by Mr. Schott and published as appendices to this volum0 are referred to in Part I under the heading "Special Scientific Work." .Among the requests referred to this division and promptly responded to was one from the Commissioners on the part of the States of Virginia and North Carolina for data needed in a resurvey of that part of the boundary line between those States which extends westward from the Atlantic coast to Nottaway River. Similar data of value were furnished to the Commissioners for the adjustment of boundary lines or parts of such lines between t'he States of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and New York and New Jersey . .A special report was made by Mr. Schott on the construction of a new primary base apparatus. The Drawing Division, under the charge of Assistant B. Hergesheimer, developed increased efficiency during the year. There was prepared in this division, at the request of the .AttorneyGeneral (for use in establishing the title of the United States to the Potomac Flats) and by direction of tl1e Secretary of the Treasury, ajae simile of Major L'Eufant's original plan of the city of Washington in the condition in which it ap1)eared on the 20th of May, 1887. From that Jae simile and from all obtainable data, there was reproduced by photolithograph an accurate copy of the original map or plan, as drawn up in the name of Peter Charles .L'Enfant, A. D. 1791. One of the copies of this valuable historic relic is now deposited in the archives of the Survey. · Information was supplied by this division in response to requests referred to it from the Engi· neer Department, U. S. Army; the U. S. Geological Survey; the U.S. Fish Commission, and from the Commissioners of Fish and Fisheries of the States of Connecticut, New York, and North Carolina. Mr. Hergesheimer refers in his report to the loss sustained by the Survey, and specially by the Drawing Division, in the resignation of Mr. Charles J unkeu, a skilled topo~apher and draughtsman, whose thorough knowledge of his profession and long experience on the work had made his services of special value. A table of charts completed or in progress during the year accompanies the report. The Engraving Division remained under the direction of Assistant Herbert G. Ogden. He had also in charge the work of electrotyping, photographing, and printing. Notwithstanding the great increase in the current work of this division due to the necessity of keeping up to date for the use of navigators all charts issued, a labor which grows every year as new charts are published, Mr. Ogden has allowed no work to fall behindhand, and has contributed greatly to the usefulness of the charts of the Survey by the publication of a series of index maps, showing the limits of the charts on various scales for the entire coast of the United States in a. geographical order. These maps being for free distribution, it is hoped that by their means a knowledge of the charts will be widely disseminated among sea-faring men. During the year the engraving of the important series of charts of the coast of Florida, from Cape Canaveral to Fowey Rocks, was completed. Mr. D. C. Chapman, electrotypist and photographer, carried on most satisfactorily the opera. tions under his immediate direction. He was specially successful in reducing original topographical sheets by photography, thus saving much time and labor of baud reduction by draughtsmen. Mr. F. Moore remained in immediate charge of the plate-prinping. A.n increase of upwards of two thousand five hundred co11ies in the number of charts supplied to the chart.room over the number for the preceding year is i·eported by Mr. Ogden. His annual report is accompanied by a. tabular statement of engraved pla.tes of charts begun, complet.ed, or continued during the year.

He commends the very efficient services of Mr. J, H. Smoot, clerk to the Engraving Division. Assistant Andrew Braiu, irr charge of the lrrstrument Division, pre11ents in his annual report many interesting details of improvements intrnduced during the Jear in the workshops, including a new gas-engine to replace the Clerk gas-engine, which could never be depended upon for drivingpower; new lathes, a new shll.per, etc. The very satisfactory test of the graduating engine by a graduation to two minutes of the circle of a new twelve-inch theodolite is adverted to, a long series of observations for probable error of position gfring a meau result of but one and four-tenths seconds for any one line. .Attention is called to the introduction, at the instance of .Assistant Fairfield, of an electric light, derived from a portable battery, to supersede the inconvenient and in many respects objectionable bull's-eye lantern, for axis illumination ancl for reading micrometers at night. Assistant ·w. I. Vinal and Subassistant F. H. Parsons, temporarily attached to this division, rendered valuable assistance iu the uetermination of the eccentricity and errors of graduation of theouolites. Mr. R. C. Glascock attended to duties involving the care of the camp equipage and other property of the Survey and the correspondence relating thereto. Mr. Braid has made a separate report upon the work executed in the Office of Construction of Standards of Weight and Measnre, the immediate charge of which he bad during the year. The wor)!: of re-determining and verifying values of standards was continued. Defects in the comparing apparatus brought ouL by this work were remedied, improvements were made in the Blair and Saxton comparators, the working balances were all carefully adjusted, aml the reflecting principle of the Saxton pyrometer was applied to test the accuracy of standard balances. In the experiments for this pnrpose Subassistant Parsons reudered very acceptable aid. U tH.ler special instructions, and by request of the Director of the .Mint, Mr. Braid and Dr. J. J. Clark, adjuster and verifier, were associated with Dr. Lawver, of the Treasury Department, in Augustt 1886, as members of a Commission to test and adjust at the Philadelphia Mint a new set of Troy weights for the .Mint at San Francisco. .Advantage was taken of this opportunity to make a re-comparison of the standard Troy pound of this Office, known as the "Star pound," with the standard pound of the Mint. Mention more in detail of this service is made under the heading "Special operations." l\Ir. A. S. Christifl, in charge of the Tidal Division, has maintained and increased its efficiency during the year. Current work was kept up to date, and proof read for the tide-tables for the coasts of the United States for 1887. The tables for 1888, prepared at an early date, were published shortly after the close of the fiscal year. The two-year series of tides observed by the International Polar J<Jxpedition to Lady Franklin Bay in 1881-1883 were reduced and communicated for publication to · Lieutenant Greely by direction of the Superintendent. This discussion involved great labor, an aggregate of seven hundred days of computing and clerical work being required to complete it. Mr. L. P. Shidy, attached to the division for many years past, made the principal reductions of tides in the harmonic analysis. Predictions with the Ferrel tide-predicting machine were made by Mr. J. W. Whitaker. The annual report of the Miscellaneous Division, submitted by its chief, Mr. M. W. Wines, General Office :Assistant, indicates a range of various and responsible duty. It contains lists of the publications of the Survey sent to press, and of those received from tte Public Printer during the year, and presents statements of the distribution of the annual reports and of t110 receipt and issue of charts, Ooa>it Pilots, and tide-tables. The total issue of charts during the year exceede~ that for the fiscal year preceding by thirty-three hundred copies, very nearly. The Archb:es and Library remained in charge of Mr. Artemas Martin. His annual report is accompanied by tabular statements of the original and duplicate records, the computations, and the origimil topographic and hydrographic sheets received and registered in the Archives during the fiscal year. .Also hy a report of the number of books and pamphlets addecl to the Library. By a re-arrangement of the original records of field-work, which was accomplii;hed during the year with the aid of Mr .·T. M. Duesberry, they were rendered much more easy of access. A card catalogue of the Library was begun. The annual report ot' Mr. John W. Parsons, who, as the re1>reseutative of Mr. George A. Ba.rtlett, Disbursing Clerk of the Treasury Department, has been iu charge of the Accounting Division

of the Office since August 23, 1886, bears internal evidence of his entire devotion to the laborious and exacting duties devolving upon him. He emphasizes strongly the need of a Disbursiftg Officer of the Survey to avoid the almost inevitable delay in forwarding remittances after the i·eceipt of vouchen:i for expenditures under the present arrangement, though recognizing at tbe same time that to facilitate the work of the division, the business of which is conducted in the name of Mr. Bartlett, everything wituin his power has been done by that officer. Mr. Parsons acknowledges the faithful and conscientious service rendered in his division by Mr. Eugene B. Wills, accountant, Mrs. S. M. Taliaferro, book-keeper and entry clerk, and 1\liss Paula E. SmitJ1, general clerk. In the office of the Assistant in charge, Dr. W. B. French continued on duty as executive and accounting clerk, foregoing any extended leave of absence from laborious service at the request of his chief. Dr. French had the skillful assistance of Miss S. C. Ayres in office correspondence and the care of records. Miss F. Oadel (until transferred to the Tidal Divisi011), Miss S. I3. Harvie, and Miss Kate Lawn also rendered acceptable clerical service. Mr. W. B. Chilton continued oa duty as clerk in the offille of the S11perintendent.
SUB·OFFICES· COAST A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Sub-office at Philadelphia.-Tbe charge of the sub-office at Philadelphia was continued during the fiscal year with Assistant S. C. Mccorkle. All calls for information from citizens or from associations which did uot im·olve a reference to ·washington were promptly answered; other calls of more moment were duly reforre(l without delay. Charts were furnished to the Engineer Bureau, U. S. Army, and to the United States LightHouse Inspector, Fourth District; to the Harbor Commission of Philadelphia, the Board of Trade, Board of Port Wardens, and Maritime Exchange ; to the J>ennsylvania Railroad Company; Engi· neers' Ulub; Appraiser of Customs for Japan, and to Messrs. Remy Vvinsor & Co., in return for valuable co·operatiou. Information was given to the Engineer Corps and to the Signal Service, U. S. Army; to the Weather Bureau of tbe State of Pennsylvania; to the Chief of the Bureau of Surveys, Board of Public \Yorks of the city of Philadelphia; tot.he Maritime Exchange, and to the Engineers' Club. Also in response to many unofficial requests from citizens. Applicants for charts for private use were referred to the sale-agents. Mr. l\IcCorkle acknowledges favors recefred from many of the official bodies above named, and reports the continuance of cordial relations between them aml the sub-office. Facilities were extended d11ring t.he year to the United State::i Advi::iory Board of the Harbor Commission, of which Assistants Henry Mitchell and H. L. Marin din are members. Also to Assist· ants R. M. and 0. M. Bache, and to Assistant Marindin and aids. Sub-o}fice at San .Francisco.-Assistant George Davidson continued in charge of the sub-office at San Francis.co. Calls for iuforrnation were answered with the aid of Mr. 1''. Westdahl, draughtsman, and Mr. Charles B. Hill, clerk. The general care of instruments and camp equipage at the sub-office remained with Vicente Denis, who served as heretofore as janitor, messenger, and porter. But a slight idea of the amount of the work done at this office is conveyed by th~ space here devoted to it. Substantially all of tbe extensive geodetic and topographical operations of tlie Survey on the Pacific coast are under its immediate supervision, and a great deal of information of a technical character is supplied from it to civil, military, and naval officers of the General Government, to State officers, to municipalities and corporations, and to individuals.
CONCLUSION.

The preparation of this Report and the editing for publication of the Annual Reports and appendices thereto have been continued in charge of Aiisistant Eel ward Goodfellow. First proofs of the Report for 1886, ordered printed March 3, 1887, were received at tliis Office early in May, and at the date at which this Report is transmitted to Congress all of the proof of

92

the Report for 1886 has been for about two months in the hands of tne Publie Printer. But owh1g to delays.in regard to the illustrations, over the reproduction of which this Office bas no control, the publication of that Report may be retarded for some months to come. In conclusion I ma,y be allowed to express the hope that the developmeut of this important . national work may have a hearty support from the Executive, and may be sustained by a wise and liberal policy on the part of Congress. Respectfully submitted. F. M. THORN, Superintendent. Hon. c. s. FAIRCHILD, Secretary of the Treasury.

REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE OF OFFICE AND TOPOGRAPHY FOR THE YEAR
ENDING JUNE 30, 1887.
UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., October 17, 1887. SIR: I have the honor herewith to submit my annual report for the Office, with the reports from each division thereof. The Computing Division has continued under the direction of Assistant Charles A. Schott, through whose able management it has met the usual calls made on it by the Survey, and been able to comply with the nuaierous requests from other departments and from individuals and corporations. Geodetic and magnetic data and star places have been supplied to Maj. Conway R. Howard and Hon. W. D. Pruden, the Commissioners on the part of the States of Virginia and North Uarolina, under whose direction a resurvey of the Interstate Boundary Line between these States extending from the Atlantic Ocean westward to the Nottaway River has been made. This line was originally surveyed by commissioners from England, and later by Colonel Byrd in 1728, and is one of the oldest of the surveys of Intercolonial Boundaries. Important data of a similar nature bave likewise been furnisbed to the Commissioners on the part of the States of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, for use in adjusting their Interstate Boundary, which has long been an unsettled matter. Like information has been supplied for the use of the honorable Commissioners of the Interstate Boundary Work between the States of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and for the honorable Commissioners on the part of the States of New York and New Jersey, in the adjustment of their Interstate Boundaries in the vicinity of Hudson River and thence southward to Raritan Bay. Much information has also been famished to the State of North Carolina, for use in the survey of the oyster beds along her shores, and to the Stat.es of New York and Connecticut similar information has continued to be supplied for use in the delineation of their oyster gro~nds. The Drawing Division has remained under the charge of .Assistant E. Hergesheimer, but for whose good management we should have had at times insufficient force to have kept up even the current work.· The number of projections for original sheets called for by_ the field parties is a heavy strain upon the Office at times, and additional draughtsmen must be had for the proper execution of the work required of this Division. Our work should be published in due season, and this is impossible without an additional force of draughtsmen. At the request of the honorable Attorney-General, and by direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, there has been prepared in this Division under your supervision an exact copy of the Original Pll!.n of the City of Washington, which was made by Peter Charles L'Enfant in 1790. This plan was so faded that 11ery much of it waa only decipl!ered after the most careful examination with reference to contemporary descriptions, a.nd its reproduction at this time will preserve from entire loss a valuable historic paper. Important information has been furnished from this Division of the Office to the Interstate Boundary Commissions of New York and New Jersey; Massachusetts and Rhode Island; Massachusetts and H. Ex. 17-8 113

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

New Hampshire, and Virginia and North Carolina; and to the Commissioners of Fish and Fish· eries of the States of Connecticut, New York, and North Carolina. United States District .Tutlg-e Addison Wood, of New York, has been supplied with information concerning tbe tides and currents in New York Bay and Harbor for use in his court. The Baltimore Harbor Board, the U.S. Fish Commission, and the U. S. Geological Survey have each been furnished with various tracings or original sheets ,or photographing from time to time. We have supplied the usual amount of information for the Chief of Engineers and officers of his corps; and have received from them valtrnble information for our charts furnished us from their resurveys of the mouths and channels of rivers undergoing improvement. I can only repeat here my recommendation of last year as to the necessity of additional draughtsmen. I also again call your attention to the fact that the Chief of this Division should receive at least three thousand dollars per annum. The Engraving Division has continued under the charge of Assistant .EI. G. Ogden, to whose zeal and efficiency the Survey is indebted for our Index Maps, which have been compl~ted during t.he year. These maps fill a long-felt want, and it is thought that their distribution will cause a much larger sale of our charts. .Among the most important charts completed duriug the year are the 1-80000 series along the eastern coast of Florida, and· on the coasts of Louisiana antl Texas. I beg to call especial attention to that portiou of the report of the Chief of the .EngraYing Division that treats of correction~ to charts already published, as our resources at certain times are taxt·tl to the utmost in correction of the copper-plates. As the coast becomes better Iightetl and bno.)·P<I, this work will increase, and I again mention the fact that additional help is required in this Division. "\Ve should have young men in training to help execute the .new work now awaiting· publication, and, in time, to take the place of those skilled engravers who are growing old in the service. 'l'hose who have been taken in to fill vacancies, so far as our itemized appropriations will admit, bave giveu entire satisfaction. The success of Mr. D. C. Chapman as Electrotypist and Photographer has been marked, and his ingenuity has devised an apparatus by which photographs can be mounted exactly to scale. The services of the Chief of the Engraving Division are worth three thousand dollars per annum, and his efficient clerk, Mr. John H. Smoot, is earning better compensation than he receives. The Instrument Division continues under the charge of Assistant Andrew Braid. New and improved tools have been introduced, and with them it is hoped we will be able not only to mak_e all repairs necessary, but to turn out all of the new work of especial construction required by the Survey. Our graduating machine is now doing good work. Mr. Braid calls attention to many iutcresting matters in his annual report, among which the introduction of the electric light for use at night in our observatories is of especial interest to field officers. The Clerk gas-engiue has been removed, and it is replaced by an Otto engine of ten horse-power, which is entirely satis· factory. Power from it bas been supplied to the carpenter's shop, and as WardweH's patent sawbeuch and a superior wood-turner's lathe have been put in, these machines greatly facilitate the ontpnt of work. The Chief of this Division of the Office has been untiring in his efforts to promote its proficiency. The turning over to him of the General Property Account, which includes the inventories of' field parties, has greatly increased his work, and to enable hirn to meet this Mr. H. 0. Glascock, accountant, has been placed under his direction. I beg to renew my recommendation that Mr. Braid's pay be placed at three thousand dollars per annum. As Chief of this Division the responsibilities are great, and every party in the Survey on land or sea has to receive prompt attention from this Division of the Office to secure its success. His services will again be alluded to in the Report of the Bureau of Weights and Measures. \Ye seem to have secured the services of the right man as Chief Mechanician when we- engaged Mr. Ernst G. Fischer in that capacity. The Tidal Division has continued under the charge of Mr. A. S. Christie, who has accom· plished a wonderful amount ~f work with most inadequate help. The dry rehearsal of work per-· formed is not likely to interest the general reader, but to one accustomed to the steady applica. tion and constant strain required of the computer it· tells of Lla.ys and months of close application to duties requiring peculiar fitness. The reduction of the two-year series of tides at Fort Conger, in Grinnell Land, which was done for General A. W. Greely, was a laborious piece of work and

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

reflects great credit upon Mr. Christie. The Tide Tables for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts for 1888 were printed somewhat in advance of previous years, and it is expected that, with no unlooked-for impediment, those for the year 1889 will be printed and ready for distribution early iu April of 1888. Mr. Ohristie's remarks about the insufficient force at his cormnaud I know to be correct, and I earnestly recommend that in the estimates provision be made to remedy the defect. Be,;ides the duties imme(liately under his charge in the Tidal pi vision, Mr. Christie has looked after the tidal stations at Pulpit Harbor, Maine, and Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The Miscellaneous Division has continued under the charge of .Mr. M. W. 'Yines, whose interesting report sets forth its work in a general way for the year. The various and responsible duties of the Chief of this Division have been performed by Mr. Wine& in a most satisfactory manner. At his suggestion the charge of the general field propert;y has been transferred to the Instrument Division, for convenience' sake. The correspondence with, aud the forwarding of charts to the various agencies is growing in amount every year, and on the general introduction of our Imlex Maps and the Illustrated Chart Catalogues further increase is anticipated. The Archives and Library have continued under the charge of Mr. Artemas Martin. Mr. J. M. Duesberry has performed tile clerical duties of the Di·dsion in a most satisfactory manner and ai'ranged the original records of Field ·Work so that they are much more accessible than formerly, although still ar,ranged in the old order of sections. Whenever a man can be had in the place who is sufficiently familiar with the records of field-work, these recor1ls should be arranged by States and bound. The report of Mr. Martin mentions the classification of the books on the shelves, etc. A card catalogue is in course of construction under his direction, and it is hoped that it will be finished before June 30,.1888. The Weights and Measures Bureau has continued under my charge, and I submit herewith the report of Mr. Andrew Braid, Assistant U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, on its operations. TLis Bureau will be placed in the hands of Assistant 0. B. Tittrnann, a& we have rnrbally agreed, as soon as his duties in the field will admit of his devoting his entire time to it. Mr. Braid, having as much work in the Instrument Division as he can well attend to without the '~eights and Measures, has earnestly recommended.this. The Accounting Divii;ion has been under Mr. George A. Bartlett, Disbursing Clerk of the Treasury Department, who ha,s under his official bonds made all disbursements for the Survey. Advances of public funds are no longer made to officers of the Survey unless they are boude~l or hold a commission in the military service. Mr. Bartlett has for two years past performed the thankless dnty of dislmrsing the Coast and Geodetic Survey appropriations without any compen· sation for his services, and I most earnestly recommend that provision be made in the estimatl:'s for an allowance of not less than $500 per annum for this duty. Except for a period of two mouths beginning early in September, 1886, during which the experiment of auditing vouchers at the Disbursing Office of the Treasury was tried, all of the auditing of the vouchers and accounting for expenditurns has been done since August 23, 1886, at the Coast and Geodetic Surve.r Oilice, under the direction of Mr. J. W. Parsons, whose report is herewith submitted. To his skill and untiring devotion to the service we are indebted for the splendi:l uruer in which the accounts now are. It is true that field officers have occasionally felt that their accounts were not passed as promptly as they wished; but it must be remembered that we have been harassed in many ways and have earnestlv endeavored to send the accounts from this Office in such form that they might defy even captiou~ criticism. We have at the same time had much extra work in the ftunisl!ing of explanations in the matter of the suspended vouchers in the unsettled accounts covering Uic last two years of the administration of Superintendent J. E. Hilgard. The amount of work growing out of these accounts can hardly be appreciated by any one not actually engaged upon it. The 11onorable First Comptroller has been very patient in considering them, even to tlie most minute details. The deeper matters have been inquired into, the more satisfactory tht' result has been for the Survey generally. · The report made by Mr. Parsons is worthy of careful consiueration, and his views as to the advisability of our having a Disbursing Clerk coincide with my own. Dr. W. B. French, assisted by Miss S. C. Ayres, has performed the laborious and exacting .clerical duties of the immediate office of the Assistant in Charge. At my earnest request he has

116

forego11e any extended leave of absence and remained almost daily at his post. I wish especially to acknowledge the skillful assistance of Miss S. C. Ayres in Office correspondence and the care of the records of leave of absence. Mr. R M. Harvey has attended t-0 the filing of letters, registering mail, and receiving and forwarding express matter. Miss S. B. Harvie and Miss Kate Lawn have contributed much to facilitate the work of my part of the Office by promptly furnishing accurate copies, by baud and by type-writer, of material intrusted to them from all Divisions of the Office. · On the 6th of January, 1887, the office of the Assistant in Charge lost the valued services of Miss :F'. Cade! Ly trausfer to the Tidal Division. Up to that date she had given faithful attention to the preparution of descriptions and sketches of stations and to miscellaneous copying. The Survey lost the service of an rwcomplished clerk when Miss l\I. L. Oliver was promoted and transferred to the '.l'reasnry Department. It is hardly necessary that I should allude here to the valuable service rendered by ,your especial clerk, Mr. William B. Chilton, but it is proper that I should extend my tllanks to him for his earnest efforts to facilitate the work of the Office generally. M1·. Sila;; E. Parsons, a trustworthy and honest man, died suddenly October 11, 1886. Mr. 'Villiaw J. McMahon, who bad served as plate-printer's helper in the Office but a short time, died Jaunary 23, 1887; and l\Ir. F. Courtenay, an accomplished engraver, died March 23, 1887. I feel that after two years of service as Assistant in charge of the Office and Topography, I am beginning to understand its many complexities. I am also more than ever convinced that whoever manages such a work must rely for success mainly upon the earne&t support of the Chiefs of Division arnl their skilled helpers. I ha.ve hail this, and beg here to express to them my high appreciation of their untiring patience and industry. In public as well as in private business a judicious division of labor is indispensable to the highest excellence in results. Such a division of labor is ilinstrated in the 11rese11t distribution of their respective special duties between the Hydrographic Office of the Navy, the U. S. Geological Survey, and the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, whose fields of operation arc sufficiently distinct to 11rcrnnt mutual encrmwbment, whil13 their methods are iu some particulars sufficiently similar to promote tlle earnest emulation which i:s a c,pndition of the highest efficiency. Belim·ing that the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey has a future of great usefulness and promise before it, and looking with pride upon its previous performanoo, I shall not cease to devq,te my !Jest efforts to its continued success and welfare. Yours, respectfully, B. A. COLONNA, Assistant in charge of Office and Topography. To Mr. FRANK l\.f. THoRN, Superintendent U. S. Ooast and Geodetic Survey.

00MPU'l'ING DIVISION", COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

June 30, 1887. Sm: In conformity with regulations I have the honor to submit the usual report of work tlone hy th(\ Slweral computers and others temporarily attached to this Division of the Office during the fiscal year ending ,June 30, 1887. The charge of the Computing Division was continued with the undersigned, and no change occurred during the yea~ in the personnel of the regular computing force, which remained the ::;ame as in the previous year, aud thus demanded its utmost exertion in order to keep up the current work and make some impression on older work now capable of being placed on standard data. Mr. A. D. Risteen was transferred to the Computing Division Oct-Ober 1, 1886, taking a place which had become free by Mr. A. S. Christie's appointment to the Tidal Division. On October 26, 1886, Mr. M. Farquhar was temporarily transferred to the p°endulum party under Assistant.

C. S. Peirce; he reported for duty in the Computing Division February 1, 1887; between April 22 and May 11, he was again engaged on pendulum work; in consequence of these tra111:ifers 1hc amount of astronomical work has suffered to some extent; besides the only telegraphic longitude work that could be attempted during the year had to be placed in tlie hands of Subassistant I'rP8ton, who was attached to the Division for less than two au<l one-half months. Mr. I'. n. Stansbury, clerk to the Computing Division, resigned on account of ill healtll some time in A ngm;t, 1886; his place has not been filled, but between August 20, 188(), and .fanuary 31, 1887, .l\Ii~~ P. E. Smith acted as writer, ancl in the same capacity Mr. W. C. l\Iaupin was engaged betwee11 FPhrnary 14, 1887, and the close of the fiscal year; technical and scientific papers are copied hy one of the computers. Of temporary help the following computer:,; were attached to this Dh-ision during the fiscal year: Subassistant F. II. Parsons from July l, 1886, to August 20; l\Ir. \T. B. Fairfield from July 1, 1886, to August O; Subassistant J. E. l\foGrath from July 22 to 20, 1886; Subassistant E. D. Preston from September 18, 1886, to NoYemher 80; AsBi8tant E. Smith from October 4, 1886, to March 22, 1887; Subassistant R. .A. :'.\larr froru October 15, 188(), to April ;, 1887; Subassistant C. IT. Van Orden from October 21, 1886, to l\larch 31, 1887. l\Ir.·T. l\l. nue;;;berry acted as writer between. February 1 and 12 inclusive. The increased general correspondence of the Office, relating to matter technical aud scientific, makes occasionally heavy demands on the computing force, and is frequently a source of uuavoiuable interference with the regular computing work; the information called for is furnished as promptly as practicablo. Besides directing, distributing, supervising, and reporting the work performed in this Division, special attention was given by me to the following discussiorn; and reports: During July, August, Septemher, October, and part of :'."ovember, 1886, I gave all my spare time to the computations, the discussion, and the report for tlw press of the magnetic a11d corresponding astronomical work of the Fort Conger Polar Expedition under commarnl of Lil'nt. A. W. Greely, U.S. A., 1881-'84; this work forms part of the International Polar Researcb,am1 will be published by the office of the United States Signal Corps. I have also brought out a new edition (the sixth) of the Discussion of the Secular Variation of the Magnetic Declination, which now comprises one thousand and seventy-one observations at ninety-four stations; this paper forms Ap1wndix ]'lo. 12 in the Report for 1886. Considerable attention, also, was given to proof-reading of certain scientific appendices in the 1885 Report. Among a large number of reports made, onn on the construction of a ne.w primary-base apparatus and one on astronomical, geodetic, and magnetic field-work proposed for the next fiscal year may be specially mentioned. I also made the usual magnetic observations in this city at the close of the year. The work performed by each computer during the year is herewith enumerated in dcfail. Edward R. Courtenay was engaged in the least square adjustment of the old antl new triungnlations of Long Island Sonnd and adjacent coasts, bringing the results up to the stanuar<l astronomical and geodetic data of the Survey. Re also chiefly supplied the required geodetic information for field and office parties; had full charge of the geodetic registers containing the geographical positions, and took care of the duplicate records deposited with the Computing Dh-ision. Ile also prepared manuscript computations for bimling, makiug in all ouc hnmlre!l large n1lumeR; assish'tl in getting up certain statistics bearing on the efficiency of the service for the years 1884-'85-'SG-'87, aud made sa.tisfactory progress with the computation and adjustment of the triangulation ahout Baltimore, 1886. Myrick H. Doolittle prepared final abtracts of horizontal directions at the eastern stations in Nevada, 1882-'83, and in western Utah, 1884-'85, and completed the computation of the primary and secondary triangulations; adjusted the primary triangulations, coast of Califoruia, south of Monterey Bay, 1884-'85-'86; computed the second~ry and tertiary triangulations in the vicinity of San Simeon of 1871-'72-'73-'74 and of 1884-'85; solved a number of normal equatiouR; computed the length of a set of four-meter base bars; adjusted the triangulation between Hereford Inlet and Absecon Light-house, New Jersey, 1881-'84-186; computed tl1e geodetic operations on the coast between Cape Fear River and the South Carolina boundary, 1886; com1mted tlle Rnpplementary triangulation of Core Sound and of Beaufort Harbor, North Carolina, 1886; computed the heights of Mount Hamilton and surrounding stations, California, and prepared abstracts of vertical angles at all primary stations in Nevada and Utah.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 0FFICE 1 DRAWING DIVISION,

Wa.<Jhington, July 28, 1887. Srn: D11ring the year ending June 30, 1887, the force of draughtsmen has been subject to change only by the loss of Mr. C. Junken, by resignation, and the employment at intervals on Pxtra-labor account of Mr. H. J. Schneider. l\lr. J unken's long servfoe and varied experience in the field and office fitted him for duties of a character that can be discharged only through careful training and familiarity with the science and methods of our work, so that adding his loss to an already small force, for most of the year we have b_een fighting accumulating work with insufficient strength to handle it with Yigor and system. Still the year has not been without valuable results. Messrs. A. Lindenkohl, H. Lindenkohl, 0. Jnnken, E. H. Fowler, E. J. Sommer, and C. Mahon have been employed upon topographical and hydrographic reductions, compilatiomi, and projections for field and office work. Messrs. P. Erichsen, E. l\Iolkow, and 0. Mahon have been for the greater part of the year, and E. A. Trescot occasionally, employed inking plane-table sheets. Mr. A. Lindenkohl has, in addition to his regular chart work, kept up the progress sketches for the annual report. Messrs. H. Limlenkohl, E. H. Fowler, E. J. Sommer, and E. A. Trescot have made finished drawings for photolithograpbing. Mr. E. H. Wyvill has been employed most of the year on projections for field-work. Messrs. E. A. Trescot, J. Olberg, and W. H. Benton have made tracings of' topographical and hydrographic maps and sketches, and the miscellaneou;; drawings that have been required. Messrs. E. Wi!lenbucher, W. C. Willenbucher, and F. C. Doljl have been on duty during the year with the Hydrographic Inspector. During the year work has been done upon the following charts and maps: On seventeen gcmeral charts from 1-bOOOOO to 1-200000 scales; on twenty-eight coast charts 1-80000 scale; on twenty-three harbor charts of various scales; on eleven charts of various scales, finished drawing bas been done for pbotolithography, of which five have been published during the year; sixty-nine plane.table sheets have been inked wholly or in part; one hundred and eleven projections were made for field-work; eighty-four tracings of original surveys, topographical and hydrographic sbeet.s, have boon fnrnished during the year at the request of private parties.

I am pleaserl to report that the yonng men who have been added to the force of engravers have rendered most satisfactory service, and promise in dne time to make up the losses sustained during the preceding year. The engravers were employed during the year principally as follows: H. M. Knight, A. Peter· sen, J. G. Thompson, and A. 0. l'tloiebsam on lettering; W. A. Thompson on topography and sand; .T. Euthoffer and R. F. Bartle on topography; H. 0. Evans and E. J. Enthoffer on saml; E. ll. Sipe and W. A. Davis on outlines, lettering, and miscellaneous corrections and additions; T. ·wasserhach on sand and miscellaneous corrections and additions; ·H. T. Knight and ll. L. Thompson on outlines and lettering; and F. Courtena~-. R. F. Bartle, jr., and J. P. Cox a. portion of the year on lettering, under the appropriation for extra engraving.

U1''TJTED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

In addition to their general occupation, all the engravers were employed at different times on the miscellaneous corrections and additions to the plates, to prepare them for priutiug, in cleaning electrotypes, and other incidental work. The most important engravings completed during· the year include the coast charts on 1-80000 sca~e of tbe east coast of Florida from Cape Canaveral to Fowey Rocks, and a series of "lndex Maps" to the charts published by the Survey, for all the coasts of the U nitell States. The Index Maps are for free distribution, and it is hoped that their instrnmentality will place our charts before a larger number of sea-faring people interested in securing reliable chart publications than any advertisement that has heretofore been attempted. The correction of the "Aids to Navigation" on the printing plates continues to occupy a large portion of the time in miscellaneous engraving, and as they are necessary changes for i.he benefit of the mariner, must be provided for in all estimates for future work. Every new chart published adds to the labor, and taken in connection with engraving arising from resurveys and the extension of old surveys to the limits required by law, it is probable that on the completion of all the charts contemplate(l by the approved scheme a larger force of expert e.ngravers will be required to maintain the charts in condition for issue than we now employ tor all purposes. If the rate of increase in this class of work experienced during the past year is maintained for a few years longer, and no substantial increase is made in the force of engravers, it will practically suspend" the publication of new charts, with the result of locking up in the archiYes a mass of original surveys that are urgently required for the benefit of national maritime inkrests. I feel that I can noti therefore, present too strongly to your consideration the necessity of an immediate increase in the number of draughtsmen and engravers employed in the Office, if we would prevent such a ~tate of affairs. The electrotyping has continued most satisfactorily under the immediate direction of Mr. D. C. Chapman, assisted during the first part of the year by l\fr. C. N. Darnall, lud during the last six months by Mr. L. P. Keyser. Mr. Chapman has also been most successful in reducing original topographical sheets by photography. Thirty-eight original sheets were thus reduced during tlrn year and mounted to scale; over one hunrlred negatives were required in the process, and the net result is represented by the outlines and topography on eight copper plates. The direct reduction of original sheets by photography, however, is of limited application. As a rule, a clearly inked sheet can be reduced four times aml furnisli a clear copy of the whole of it., aud eight ti111es if only the principal outlines are required; but in the latter case the serYices of a draughtsman may be necessary in some cases to bring the work out fully. Engraved charts on scale of 1-80000 have also been reduced to 1-400000, the outlines inked and generalized by a draughtsman, and the detail to be omitted washed out before mounting the print. In all cases of reduction, tlie limit permissible is largely defined by the generalization required on the reduced scale, and geuera11y a reduction of more than four times necessitates the employment of a draughtsman to perfect the prints. Further experirnent1.1 with processes of reduction were in contemplation, hut the overburdened condition of the Drawing Division has necessitated their postponement to a more convenient season. . The Printing Office has continued under the management of Mr. F. l\Ioore, with l\Icssrs. D. N. Hoover and J. Beck in charge of the thirty-eight and thirty-six inch presses, as heretofore. The aggregate of prints pulled is not so large as in former years, as ouly one thousand one hundred and six copies were furnished the Ooa.st Pilot Division against seven thousand four hundred and eighty-two the preceding year. Thirty-one thousand and se,'en copies were pulled for the chartroom, an increase of two thousand firn hundred and eleven t'Jver the preceding year. This is the largest number ever furnished the chart-room in one year. Many changes have taken place during the year in the force employed in the Division. Mr. F. Courtenay, an expert Jett.er engraver engaged on contrallt work, died March 25, 1887, after a service of about twenty years. In the estimation of bis associates, Mr. Courtenay's earlier engrav. ings were unexcelled in clearness and beauty of form, and ser\'e to-day as a standard for the most expert. William J. McMahon, a "printer's helper," died January 15, 1887, after a brief term of service. Mr. McMahon, although suffering from an incurable malady, stood manfully to his work, only relinquishing his labor when there was uo longer physical strength to maintain it,

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Mr. A. C. Ruebsam, engraver, resigned August 9, 1887, after a service of ten years. Mr. Uucbsam had learned his art in the employ of the Survey, under the immediate direction of his uncle, l\fr. E. A. Maedel, and showed much of the family talent iu the execution of his work. Mr. T. Sullivan, printer's helper, resigned April 22, 1887, after a service of more than four years. Mr. Sullivan was industrious and efficient in the performance of his duties through the whole per\pd of his service. Mr. Lynn Troutman, first employed as an extra hand in the electrotype rooms October 19, 1886, was transferred to the Printing Office January 11, 1887, where he bas since rendered satisfactory service as printer's helper. Mr. S. B. Shelton, ap1)0inted a printer's helper April 23, 1887, has also rendered satisfactory service during the brief term of bis employment. Mr. Louis P. J{eyser was appointed assistant to the electrotyper and photographer February 11, 1887, and haR thus far shown an aptitude for the delicate and reRponsible work required of him that is exceedingly gratifying. The appointment of Messrs. H. T. Kuight and H. L. Thompson to the regular force of engravers on September l, 1886, has thus far proved most satisfactory, and promises to perpetuate in the Survey the talent of their predecessors. It also gives me pleasure to report a continuance of most satisfactory a.nd efficient services hy Mr. John H. Smoot, the clerk of the Division. His duties are detailed and laborious, an<l he attends to them with a promptness and zeal well worthy of emulation. I transmit herewith the usual list of plates completed, continued, and commenced during the year, and I have the honor to remain, Yours, very respectfully, HERBERT G. OGDEN, Assistant C-. S. Coast and Geodetfo Survey, · In charge of Engrm,ing Dii·ision. B. A. C.oLONNA, Esq., Assistant in charge of Office, etc.

R.El'ORT UP l'HB LV81'.RUJIENT DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OPPJCE, FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNB 30, 1887.

U. S. COAST AND GEODET'fC SURVEY UPFit!E, Washington, September 7, 1887. DEAR Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report of the Instrument Division for the fiscal year ending Juue 30, 1887. The duties of this Division include the care of the instruments, camp equipage, and miscella· neous property of the Survey, and the receiptl'.I and sl1ipments of the same; the repairs and alterations of instruments, and the making and purchase of new ones; the preparation of instnunents for the field, including their critical examination and adjustment, and the determination of constants, such as level values, micrometer valu1~s, inequality of pivots, etc.; the official· correspondence relating thereto, and the keeping of the records and inventories. As heretofore, the main work of the mechauicians has consisted of repairs and alterations of iustrunwnt8, but some new work, mainly protractors, sectors, declinatort1 1 etc., has also been accomplished, and several old instruments that had become unserviceable have been reconstructed or converted into other forms. The large amount of repairing needed for tile various clas:sm1 of iustrn· ments used in tile extensive and varied operations of the Survey precludes the possibility, with our limited force, of manufacturing on a large scale, but it is hoped that with our now improvctl facilities a better t1howiug in this respect will be made in the future. During the year four new lathes, a new shaper, and sundry minor tools were added to the shop eq ni pment. t-0 replace worn out or antiquated implements, and the result has boon a marked improvement both as to quality and quantity of work turned onto The gas-engine heretofore in use bad nC\·er worked satisfactorily, and finally gave out altogether. Its irregular and spasmodic working, or more frequently its failur.:i to work at all, caused great annoyance and vexatious delays, and it has now been superseded by oue oflmtter construction and greater power. The new engine, so far, has given entire satisfactfon, and we have been able since its introduction to extend the shafting, not o~ly to all the machinery of the instrument shop, but also to the carpenter shop, where new machrnery has also been added.

The level-grinder commenced during the previous fiscal year has been completed, but the results so far obtained have not been satisfactory, and some modifications of the original design have been found necessary. The fault is not in the principle of the machine, but in the mechanical execution, there being too much flexure in some of its parts and too much play in some of the points. In my last report I mentioned the experimental two-minute graduation of a fourteen-inch circle, which had not at tbe date of the report been tested. A similar graduation bas been put upon the circle of a new twelve inch theodolite and carefully tested through a long series of observations by Messrs. F. H. Parson::; and W. I. Yiiml, whose mean results show a prol>aLle error of only one and four-tenths of a secon<l for the position of any one line. The maximum coml>ine<l error of graduation and uncertainty of observation in any set of the series is six and a half seconds. This result is very satisfactory. Tlte instrument is now in use·in the field by Assistant G. A. Fairfield, who will make a report upon it at the close of the season. I would here call attention to the introduction, at the instance of .Assistant Fairfield, of the electric ligltt to supersede the inconvenient and objectionable bull's-eye lanterns for axis illumination and for reading micrometers dnring night observations. The battery used is nry portable, being contained in a box ten by four and three-quarter inches, aml will run a three-carnlle power incandescent lamp about three hours. By having seYeral of these batteries, continuou::; observations can be made througltout the night when necessary. A strip of sheet rubl>er surrounding the base of the theodolite carries the two coJlper wires connected with the battery and insulates them frorn each other. The observer has the lamp attached to the button-hole of his coat by rneaus of a telephone cord, to which is attached a spring clip, by means of which be can in any po~itiou bring his lamp into the circuit. Another similar lamp, suitably mounted, furnishes the axis illumination, and can at will be thrown out of the circuit. It is believed that the use of the;;;e lights will adcl to the accuracy of night observations by largely reducing the heating efl:ect upon tlie. instrument, and 'Yill moreover save the observer the inconvenience and discomfort of handling hot lamps and inhaling the offensive products of combustion. The following statement shows in detail the force employed in this Division during the ~·ear, and indicates the character of the work performed by each : Mr. R. E. Schubert serYed as foreman of the shop from October 4, 1886, to ]\fay 14, 1887, when he resigned and was succeeded by Mr. E. G. Fischer, who entered upon hiti duties June 1,
1887.

Mr. E. Eshleman served during the entire year. He was employe<l upon the examination and adjustment of instruments; the repairs of theodolites, reconnoitering telescopes, meridian tran. sits, heliotropes, levels, barometers, vertical circles, zenith telescopes, sectors, etc.; in testing levels; silvering sextant and heliotrope mirrors; ruling of diaphragms, etc.; and in graduating theodolite circles, protractors, sextants, station transits, etc. Mr. L.A. Fischer served during the entire year. He has made new protractors, position indicators, letter-gauges for the Engraving Division, glass scales arnl adapters, tools for t.lte shop and dividing engine, and has worked upon the repairs of theodolites,· dip circles, magnetometers, vertical circles, alidades, levels, sextants, etc., and attended to tile office clocks. Mr. S. A. Kearney likewise served during the entire year, and has made ·new station transits, screw stocks, tripod heads, clamps, hub and dies, microscope brackets, straight-edges, tools, and tracing apparatus; repaired pantograph, ste.el tapes, alidades and plane tables ; attended to the running of the gas.engine and assisted in the erection of the new shafting. Mr. P. Vierbuchen served during the entire year, and bas been engaged upon the repairs of plane tables, plane-table compasses, alidades, protractors, tide-gauges, levels, sectors, ship~.' compasses, signal lamps, and zenith telescopes. He has also made twelve new plane-table compasses, two one-hundred feet base wires, and sundry tools, and: reconstructed two self-registering tidegauges. Mr. W. Suess served during the entire year. He has completed the new level-grinder; made and graduated metric scales; attended to the office bells and batteries; and repaired magnetometers, pantographs, compasses, clocks, heliotropes, sextants, and dip circles.

Mr. Theodore Gerhard was employed from the beginning of the fiscal year to August 6 and again from October 15 to the close of the year. He has made new micrometers, beam compasses, and patterns, and has repaired theodolites, sextants, heliotropes, levels, engineers' transits, planimeters, compasses, gradienters, and binoculars. He has also mounted lenses and micrometers, and made three new triangles for the Los Angeles :Magnetic Observatory. Mr. 1\1. Lauxman served during the whole year, and was employed upon miscellaneous work, such as making bolts, taps, and dies, shoes for instrument stands and telemeters; clamps, screws, hooks, plummets, and capstan bars; in cleaning and polishing drawing instruments and metal work; in marking instrument boxes,-etc. He also assisted Mr. Kearney in the work upon the gasengine. In the carpenter shop, the usual work, consisting of the making of telemeters, instrument stands and easos, plane-table and drawing boaras, and patterns; the packing of instruments, etc., for transportation ; the erection of shelving; the making of booK:, reconl, and chart cases for tlie various Di visions, and for the Arc!Ji ves and Library; the rniiscellaueous repairs of the building an<l its furniture, etc., has been attended to. Mr. II. 0. French has had immediate charge of this work, and was assisted during the whole year by Mr. G. W. Clarvoe; from the lJeginuing of the year to October 11 by Mr. S. E. Parsons, and from March 1, 1887, by Mr. 0. M. Daruelle. Mr. R C. Glascock haR attended to the books and records relating to the camp equipage and other miscellaneous property of the Survey and the official correspondence relating thereto. nuring the interval between field seasons, Assistant W. I. Vinal and Subassistm1t F. H. Parsons were temporarily attached to the Instrument Di vision and rendered valuable assistance in the deterrniuation of eccentricity and errors of graduation of theodolites, and in miscellaueous observations aud computations. Mr. Parsons's services will be further mentioned in the annual report of the Weights and Measnres Division, which has also remained under my charge. Yours, respectfully, ANDREW BHAID, Ass-istmit Coast and Geodetic Survey. Mr. B. A. COLONNA, Assistant in charge of Office, Washington, D. 0.

WasMn9to1i, D. C., June 30, 1887. SIR : I have the honor to submit herewith the report of this Division for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1887. The work done during the year was as follows: 1. An aggregate of three years one month of tide-rolls, four years one month of tabulated high and low waters, three years one month of tabulated half-hourly ordinates, two years ele\·en months of meteorological abstracts, two months of temperatures and densities of the sea, one hundred and sixty-two original volumes of staff rea.dings, and one hundred and thirty-eight duplicate volumes of staff readings was received, examined, and registered; and seventy letters were prepared relating thereto. 2. The major part of the proofs were read for the Tide Tables for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts for the year 1887, two volumes octavo; like tables for the year 1888 were prepared, and the Jlroofs read for the Atlantic coast. 3. Tidal data and information were prepared and furnished in response to nineteen calls from persons not connected with the Survey. This includes the report furnished to the Chief Signal Officer, U. S. Army, upon th~ two years of tidal observa.tioDS made at Fort Oonger, Grinnell Land,

by Lieutenant Greely's command in 1881-'83. TLis report consisted of one hundred and seventy. two pages of text in manuscript, with six: plates aml illustrations, and represents an aggregate of se,·en hundred days of coruputing and clerical work. 4. Tide notes for twenty-two stations were prepared for publication on the charb; of the Survey, arnl a considerable number oflikc notes (110 record was kept until recently) were prepared for the Coast Pilot Di ,-is ion. 5. The mean sea-level at Biloxi, Miss., was computed by lnnations from September 7, 1881, to December 24, ] 832, and f~uished for the rnm of the Computing Di vision. 6. Tidal data have been prepared for the use of field parties as required. .A recoru beginning .April 15, 1887, shows that fron1 that date to June 30, such da,ta were prepared and furnished ior eighty-seven stations in respou:se to eigh~en requio.itions. 7. .An aggregate of two years of obserrntions was discussed by the harmonic analysis for pur· poses of prediction at New London, "\Vashington, and Key West. 8. The reduction and co-ordination of all available tidal data in the v1cinit;r of New York City was begun by the reduction of some forty short series, and a like work was initiated for Delaware Bay and River. 9. Stencil addition forms were prepared for harmonic component v.

Mr. Alex. S. Christie remained in charge tbrougl10ut the year. It was found practically convenient, if not absolutely essential to tlie prompt prorluction of results called for, to employ each member of the force more or less upon almost ewry description of the work. As exceptions to this rule the examination and registration of records received, the preparation of correspondence, and the writing of reports, were attended to invariably by the CLief of Division, the principal reductions in the harmonic analysis were made by Mr. L. P. Shidy,, nntl the predictions with the machine by Mr. J. W. Whitaker. The whole force was kept constautly employed, and with one exception (brought to your attention by my letter of October G, 1886) the several computers and clerks evinced a very satisfactory disp()sition to do their duty. The Division is, however, lamentably deficient in computing power and should be re-enforced by two computers of standard ability, preferably by young men of sixteen to twenty years. This would insure the pntting of the tidal work on its feet . . Yours, very respectfully,

ALEX. S. CHRISTIE, Chief of Tidal Division.

UNITED ST.A.TES CO.A.ST .A.ND GEODETIU SURVEY.

REPORT OF THE MISCELLANEOuS DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, ltl87.

DEAR SIR: I have the honor to submit herewith the usual report of this Division for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1887. The work of the Division included, as in former years, the printing and issue of the Anuual Reports and other publications of the Survey, and of all record book!l, blank forms, etc., used iu the field-work and in the business of the Office; tl!e correspondence with sale agents relllting to the supply and sale of charts, Coast Pilots, and Tide Tables, and keeping the accounts connected therewith; tlte purchase, custody, and issue of stationery; the supervision of the Office bniltlings, and such other apecial duties as were assigned from tim· to time. Experience having shown that it would facilitate business to place the general field property, including camp equipage, in charge of the Instrument Division, an order to that effect was issued on my suggestion, and the tram;fer was made on April 21, 1887. From that date the Instrument Division has had charge of the issue of such property, together with all the books and papers relating to the same. The Report of the Superintendent for the year ending June 30, 1885, and the Tide Tables for the year 1887, for uoth the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States, which bad been sent to press in the preceding fiscal year, were published. .A. third edition of the Atlantic Local Coast Pilot, Subdivision 13," South Coast of Long Island, New York Bay, and Hudson River," was also published. Tile following publications were sent to press during the year: Tide Tables for the Atlantic coast for 1888; Tide Tables for the Pacific coast for 1888; Atlantic Local Coast Pilot, Subdivision 6-7, "Cape Ann to l\fonomoy;" Atlantic Local Coast Pilot, Sub· division 9, ''Buzz;ord and Na.rragansett Bays;" Atlantic Local Coast Pilot, Subdivision 21, ·'Tybee Roads to .Jupit,er Inlet;" and a new edition of the "Catalogue of Charts." Tile mmal distribution of the Report for 1885 and of the other publications of the Surveyi, to the Departments of Government, to institutions, and individuals was made. The .A.ppen<lices to the .A.nuual Reports, published in pamphlet form, were, upon application, distriuuted gratuitomils as heretofore. Twelve Notices to ~fariners, a list of which is embodied in this report, were issued during the year.

From the preceding statement, it will be seen that there were registered in the Archives during the fiscal year ending J u11e 30, 1887, 3-19 ,-olumes of geo1letic observations, and 10 voluml's and 115 cahiers of computatiom;; 6d n1lunws aml 2 cahil'rs of astro110Uiical observations, 128 chronograpl1 sheets, and 6 volumes and 67 cahiers of compntations; 11 volumes, 102 cahiers, and 1 sheet of magnetic cbsen·ations, 1,005 sheets of mag11etic tnices, and 4 cahiers a11d 111 Rheet:;; of computations; 3 volumes and 1 cahier of pendulum observations, and 4 cahiers of computations; 2 volumes and 1 caliier of meteorological observations; 1,226 volnmes and 22 cahiers' of h~'Uro graphic observations, 11 rolls of tide curves, aud 181 bottles of specimeiis of sea-bottom; 44 completed original topographic ~1heets, and G8 completed original bydrographic sheets. Dming tlrn past fiscal year the records in the Archives have been re-arranged and labeled, so that they are now in much better condition am] easier of access than heretofore; and 117 volumes of computations liave been hound in a snbRtnntial manner, but there still remains a large mass of observations autl computations that ought to be bound. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1887, there were recei\'ed and registered in the Library 470 \"Olnmes, houud and unbound, besirh·s periodicals and scientific publications. Although 130 volumes were bound in a substantial manner duriug the past fiscal year, there are Mill quite a number of \"olumcs that need rebinding, and also a large number of unbound worb and periodicals tllat ouglit to be bound. 'l'he hooks in the Library bave been mostly re-arranged and classified, and the shelves numbere1l, and a card catalogue liegnn. I was sick from .July 1, 1886, till ·some time in September, and was not able to be at tl!e Office hut a few <la~·s during that time. l\fr. J. l\L Dnesberry was in charge of tlie Arcbfres and Library during my absence. Ou ~ovember 10, 1886, Mr. Duesberr;y was temporaril~· assigned to the Accounting Division, and did not return to the ArchiYes till :February 14, 1887. Mr. A. D.

During the year the redetermination and verification of values of standards has been continued, and this work has led to the <liscovery of defects in the comparing apparatus, which have as far as possible been remedied. The Blair comparator bas been overhau1etl aud appliances adtled for securing the verticality and parallelism of the two microscopes. The yaJues of tlie micrometer screws of this instrument haYe itlso been redetermined, and observations are now in progress to determine the effect of temperature upon these Yalues. The Saxton comparator has also been tborougLly repaired and put in good working order, and an allditional eye-piece of higher magnifying power has been added to its microscope. The comparing apparatus for four and five meter bars has been tested and fournl nu satisfactory, owing to the instability of the piers on which the comparators are mounted. These piers are tall and slender, and the slight lateral pressure incident to making contacts during observations produces a perceptible motion, equal to at least ten divisions of the comparator lc>el. If the present comparing room is still to used, these piers must be rebuilt, but as before reported, this room is vers unsuitable for tlie purpose and another shonltl be provided without delay. This is especially important in view of the proposed construction of a new iirinmry base-apparatus. 'l'he working balances have all been carefully adjusted, and their plaues and knife.edges examined. In determining values of weights it has been found impracticable at present to arrive at greater accuracy than the thousandth of a graiu, as rcpeateu observations, made with the greatest care and under the s~me conditions, always sliow Yariations in the fourth decimal place. To oYcrcomc thh; difticnlty, which was supposed to I.Jc due to uucertaiuty in estimating tenths of scale dh'isions, the reflecting principle of the Saxton pyrometer was applied to one of the medium-8ized Becker balances. A small mirror was aTtached to the upper part of tlrn pointer, its center in liue with the central knife-edge. A piece of parallel plate-glass was inserted in the side of the balance case, and a telescope with a vertical scale attached was mouuted at a distance of twenty feet. The oscillations of the beam were noted b;y observing readings of the reflected scale. The hundredths of scale divisions were now read with greater cc>rtainty than the tenths by the usual method; but the results obtained, while more accordant and satisfadory than before, were still uncertain in the fourth decimal place, as miuute defects found to exist in the kuifo·edges neutralized to a great extent the advantage of increased readiug 11ower. TlJese .knife-edges were made with great care antl by one of the best makers, and when examined with a microscope seem to be nearly \)erfect, yet their defects become apparent when tested in this way. A Philadelphia manufacturer now makes a balance which, it is claimed, is superior to any heretofore in the market, and I would recommend that one be procured for trial, and purchase if found satisfactory. The weighing and comparing apparatus of the Bureau of Standard Weights and Measures should, of course, be the best obtainable. In August, 1886, in accordance with instructions from tbe Superintendent and by request of the Director of the Mint, a visit to the Philadelphia Mint was made by Dr. J. J. Clark and myself for the purpose of testing and adjusting a new set of 'l'roy weights for the 'San Francisco Mint, and advantage was taken of the 011portunity to make a recomparison of the stamlard Troy })Ound of this Office, known as the "Star po·und,'' with the standard pound of the Mint. The results have already been fully stated in my report of September 4, 1886.· The calls upon this Office by other Departments of the Government and by private parties for the tei:;ting and adjus~ment of weights,.staudards of length and capacit;y, thermometers, hydrometns, etc., and for information on subjects related to weights and measure/(, hiwe, as heretofore, received prompt attention.

For work done for private parties a charge is made sufficient to cover the actual expense The receipts from this source during the year have, however, been !"mall, amounting to only twenty-three dollars. Por work ctone for Departments of the Government, no charge is made. The employes of the Division are two in number, viz, Dr. J. J. Clark, adjuster and verifier, and T. Gerhard, mechauician. The latter, during the greater part of the year, was detailed for duty in the Instrument Di¥ision. Subassistaut .F. II.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ACCOU2vTING- DIVISION COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE.
ACCOUNTING DIVISION,

U. S.

Co.A.ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, D. O., October 11, 1887. Sm: I have the honor to submit herewith a brief resume of the operations of the Accounting Division for the fiscal year ending Jnne 30, 1887. On August 23, 1886, in obedience to your verbal instructions, subsequently confirmed by the Superintendent in his letter of August 28, 1886, I assumed charge, as the re.presentative of the Disbursing (Jlerk of the Treasury Department, of this Division, with Mr, .James C. Edwards, Accormtant, as principal assistant. I bad previously acted in an advisory capaoity to the Disbursing Clerk in the preparation and rendition of his accounts to the First Auditor, and when assigned to the charge of the Accounting Division, was on duty in his office at the Treasury Department. The appointment of Mr. Edwards as Accountant became effective from August 24, 1886, the services of his predecessor having ceased upon the preceding day. I found, upon taking charge of the Division, that the daily current work had been fairly well brought up to date, and but few acco1111ts remained unadjusted. I subsequently, however, hail much trouble in securing a balance, as transactions involving many thousands of dollars had been entirely overlooked by the person formerly in charge of the Division, and no record whatever of their entry or payment could be fonuu npou any of the books. After much labor and re8earch, in which I had the valuable assistance and expcrieuce of the Disbursing Clerk, the accounts were finally brought into thorough balance, in which condition they have since remained. In tlie early part of September, 1886, the Division, with all its appurtenances, excepting the unplicate files, was transferred to the Treasury Department, and placed under the immediate super· vii:iion of l\ir. George A. Bartlett, Disbursing Clerk. In making this removal it was assumed that a more rapid adjustment of the accounts could be effected by being in close proximity to the accounting officers, whose decisions as to disputed points in the accounts could be more readily obtained and hence acted upon with greater promptitude. This arrangement was continued until November G, 1886, when the delay necessarily incident to a response to referred communications from the Office became so embarrassing, owing to the distance apart of the two offices, as to com· pel its abandonment, and the Division was retnrned to its old quarters in tbe main building of the Survey. The necessity for an almost continual reference to tbe records of the Division was an element which also contributed largely towards bringing about its return to the Office. Owing to an unfortunate illness :M:r. Ellwards was compelled to return home on August 25, 1886, and di<l not again r<>port for duty until October 4, 1886. On the day following he resigned from the Service. During his absence the Pntire work of the Division was necessarily performed by myself alone, and owing to the unaaiually large number of parties in the .fi.eld at this time, the

139

labors of the.office were exceedingly onerous an<l exacting1 and. the adjustment an<l sPttlement of the accounts progressed but Rlowly, naturally cam;ing mnch complaint. During a large portion of this period, aside from personal affiictiou by death in my family, I was mucl.i embarrassed and hampered, and the work of the Division delayed to an almost immeasurable and unreasonable extent, by the necessity which arose for the response on my part to malicious]~· false and vindictive charges filed against me at the Department by llRrties whose futile attempts to nRP mp as a means of gratifying their personal prejudices and spite against leading officers of the Sun'ey resulted in their own complete discomfiture. Upon the return of the DiYision to this Office, Mr. J. M. Dnesberry, 011 November 10, 1886, and Mrs. S. 1\1. Taliaferro, on :Kovember 16, 188G, were assig11ed to duty therein, the former as General Clerk, and the latter as Entry Olerk and Book-keeper. Mr. Duesberry rendered faithful service until February 1, 1887, when Im was transferred to the Computing Division. A change being deemed ad\'isable in th4l method of keeping the property records of the Survey, Mr. R. C. Glascock, Accountant, acting as Pro11erts Ulerk, was ai;;signed to duty in the Division on November 29, 1886. It was soon found, howeyer, that the attention 11ecessary to the formulation and keeping of the prppcrty records, and the supervision of the geueral property on storage in the Office, could not be successfully prosecuted by this Division, as at present organized, owing to its inadequate force; and, as the Instrument Division was keeping a record of its owu special class of property, to amid duplication and to centralize as nearly as possilJle in one office the records of property, Mr. Glascock was, on April 11, 1B87, transferred to the Instrument Division, together with the general property records. Ou December 11, 1886, Mr. Eugene B. Wills was appointed Accountant and assigned to duty in the Division; and on February 1, 1887, Miss Paula E. Smith reported for dutJ· as General Clerk in place ~f Mr. Duesberry, transferred. It is almost impossible to furnish intelligible statistics of such work as that accomplished in this Division. The following, however, is submitted as showing to some extent the volume of work which required attention during the last fiscal year: Vouchers received and audited ......................·............ : . . . . . . . 16, 742 Approved estimates received and filed. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 420 CheckA drawn and issnerl.. . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3, i'l68 Letters received, acted on, and filed .. _............................ _.... _ 3, .143 Letters written. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . 3, 257 Appropriation and allotment accounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 444 In addition to the foregoing, there are a large number of boob. of entry, records, etc., which have to be maintained, besides the preparation of the annual statements for Congress and the numerous responses to calls for information. Dnring the month of January, 1887, new forms of vouchers for the use of the Rurvey, both in the field and in the Office, were prepared, and issued shortly thereafter. Each voucher carries with it, iu the form of pl"iute(l directions, nearly all essential instructions for its preparation aml rendition, under the rulings and decisions now enforced by the accounting officers, In view of the technical character of the work required from the employes of this Division, and, the uecessity for a comparative isolation from interruption, I would rPspectfnlly recommend tbe erection of a counter or similar barrier, surmounted by the usual s<:reen work, in the rooms of the Accounting Division at as early a date as may be practicable. The expense involved would be small comp1.1ired to t.he ad vantages which would accrue m a more rapid accomplishment of the work. This feature of freedom from interruption for accounting clerks is fully recognized at the Treasury Department, where the most stringent regulations arfl in force as to admission to the rooms, and in many cases permission must first be obtained from the chief clerk or other officer in ch"llrge of the office. The conditions are somewliat different here, as the uecussities of the service require fre(iueut conferences with the Accounting Division on the part of officers and others as to the condition of available balances on appropriations, allotments, etc.; hut apart from these, good business 11rinciples wou\d seem to demand a certain degree of privl\cy am.l quietude for persons engaged rn thie laborious, exacting, and absorbing duties of auditing, adjusting, and settling accounts, involving

140

an almost continual series of perplexing questions, rulings, and decisions, and an ·interminable reference to laws and regulations bearing thereon. Even in the most ordinary line of commercial pursuits, the merchant, realizing the necessity for the essential feature& of accuracy, rapidity, and neatness in the keeping of his records and the management of his accounts, allots a separate apartment or office to his accounting clerk or book-keeper, isolated from the interruptions and confusion iuciueu: to his general business transactions. I trust it may not be considered out of place for me to expres8 my belief that the prompt, aml, I may say, better accomplishment of the work of the Accounting Division almost imperatively requires the appointment of a Disbursing Officer. A more complete organization of the Division is required. In my opinion, the record of receipts and disbursements of public money, no matter from what source, and the proper and systematic keeping of the accounts of public property on hand and purchased (the vouchers for which pass through the Division), relating to the Coast and Geodetic Survey, should be a part of the work of the Accounting Division. To do this 11ro1ierly some responsible bonded officer should be in charge with an adequate force to assist him. Nodoubt 1mch an arrangement would be more expensive than the present one, but in the end the results wouhl show the wisdom of such action. The present system, moreover, is productive of much delay iu the prompt settlement of accounts, and has resulted more than once in great embarrassment to officers of the field service, and thereby to some extent in crippling and retarding the progress of the tield work. With a disbursing officer, remittances could be made frequently on the same day that the accounts or vouchers are received. As it is now, however, a delay of three or more days is almost inevitable in each case, and even this minimum is obtained only by extra exertion and almost constant labor long after office hours. Much more could be said upon this subject in support of the necessity which exists for a Disbursing Officer for the Survey, and at some future time r hope to make a separate report more clearly defining the difficulties under which we nowlabor without one. Mr. Eugene B. Wills, Accountant, Mrs. S. M. Taliaferro, Book-keeper and Entry Clerk, and Miss Paula E. Smith, General Clerk, have all rendered conscientious and faithful service, and it gives me great pleasure to so record it. Mr. Wills bas been most untiring in his efforts to assist in the adjustment of accounts, and has, of his own volition and from a sincere interest in his work, given much extra time beyond office hours in seconding my efforts to secure a prompt transaction of the business of the Division. Much of his time, moreover, ia necessarily passed at the Department in drawing checks, etc., and during these intervals his work in the Division naturally falls behind, and his usefulness as an accounting clerk is constantly impaired by the frequent interruption8 occasioned by his enforced absence. It is impossible for any person to thoroughly analyze aud adjust intricate accounts under such circumstances with any degree of satisfaction. Mrs. Taliaferro aml Miss Smith have accomplishf'd an amount of work in their respective positions wl1ich is wol'thy of all praise, and it would seem only just that some provision should be made by which an increased emolument could be given them as a recognition of the services they have rendered. Mr. George A. Bartlett, Disbursing Clerk of the Treasury Department, has ever done everything within 'his power to facilitate the work of this Division, the business of which is all conducted in bis name, and for which he is mainly responsible. His uuiform courtesy in all matters of business pertaining to the Coast Survey coming within his province has made the burdens of the work of the Division appear much easier. It is not saying too much when I express the opinion that the dislmrsements made by Mr. Bartlett for this service, small in a.mount as they are compared with his disbursements for the Department, which aggregate millions of dollars per annum, ·occasion him more annoyance and embarrassment, and are a greater source of anxiety and trouble to him tha-q all his other disbursements combined. 1t would seem, in justice to Mr. Bartlett, and in view of the fact that the Coast Survey bas no Disbursing Officer of its own, that some compensation should be made to him for the onerous responsibility thrust upon hiro, in addition to his own legitimate duties, of making disbursements for the Coast and Geodetic Survey. In conclusion, I would respectfully recommend that some action be taken t.o secure for the Division the services of some person who could act, when nece@sary, as a stenographer. Such service would not probably be required as a permanent feature in the organization of the Division,

e.e a. few hours daily would, no doubt, suffice; but, unquestionably, some relief should be afforded in the preparation of the corresponcleuce of 1Lis Di>ision, which, while it is of a tecJ.rnical character, is also greater than that of any other office in 11e building. With the assistance of a stenographer much of the time now ginn to the rough drafting of letters in settlement of accounts could bo utilized in other ways much more to the advantage of the service, and would rPliHe the DiYision of much of the extra labor out of office hours which iR now imposed up011 it, and, I think, unjustl;yso.

No. 5.-1887.

REPORT OF THE HYDROGRAPHIC INSPECTOR FOR THE YEAR ENDING JCNE 30, 1887.
U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, Washington, October 8, 1887. Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report of bydrograpbic work and care of ve&o sels of the Survey, with which I am charged, for the fiscal year ending Jun6 30, 1887.
RYDROGRAPHY-ATLANTIC COAST.

When the appropriations would admit of it, the hydrographic parties were already in the field

at the beginning of the fiscal year.
The Long Island Sound parties, for instance, began work in May and June, supported by money that had been saved from the preceding summer's work, thus giving them a long season, the results of which are much more gratifying than if the work had had to be delayed until July 1. The bydrography on the coast of Maine was carried on by a party in the Bache under charge of Lieut. J.M. Hawley, U.S. N. As the outside work from Libby Island to Quoddy Head had never been surwyed 7 it was deemed important that it should he pushed as rapidly as possible, and completed before the end of the season. This was accomplished, and the chart indicating this work is about read~, for issue. In May, 1887, Lieut. F. H. Crosby, U.S. N., in the Gedney, was ordered to proceed to the coa1>t of Maine and take up some bydrographic examinations required in the Penobscot RiYer, aurl upon the completion of these, to begin a hydrographic survey of the St. Croix River from East.· port northward. His party reached Eastport and began this survey at the end of the fiscal year. Lieut. J. E. Pillsbury, U. S. N., in the Blake, made a physical sur'\'e,\· of the coast of :Massachusetts near Chatham, with a view of ascertainiug the changes tliat wen' made in the coast-line by littoral currents, this information being needed by Prof. Henry Mitchell, Assistant Coast lmd Geodetic Survey, in carrying on his investigations. The work in Long Island Sound was carried on by the Gedney, Lieut. F. B. Crosby, U.S. N.; the Palinurus, Lieut. D. D. V. Stuart, U. S. N.; and the Arago, Lieut F. S. Carter, U. S. N., and Ensign W. J. Sears, U. S. N. These parties were well provided with skilled officers and experienced men, well fitted with steam-launches and boats, and the rt'sults of tbe "season's work were all that could be expected, the resurvey of this important water thoroughfare being completed in such a manner as to render another survey unnecessary, with the exception, possibly, of entrances to rivers and special developments that may be required for engineering purposes, for a huudred years at least. The survey of the harbor of New York was carried on to completion, during the summer season of 1886, by parties under command of Li('ut. C. P. Perkins, U.S. N., in the Eagre, and Lient. G. C. Hanus, U. S. N., in the Endeavor and Daisy. As it was deemed advisable to make the survey of this, the most important harbor in the United States, as perfect as possible, a degree of refinement was used not called for in most hydro· graphic work. 143

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODBTIC SURVEY.

As an indication of the exteut arnl clcseness of t!Jis v.-ork I find that oyer two thousand one lrnndrcd miles of soundiug line:s were nrn, with ovel' 143,200 casts of tbe lead-all of this in one scasou. The tidal stations occUJ)ied in the Lower Eay and North and East mvers were num1rous. Witll l1 view of determining if m1;y ('bauges occurred (m or near Sandy Hook bar, due to tidal currents at different phases of the moon, or to gales of w~nd, a small area was selected in the East Channel and a survey was made at iuterrnls of about seven days. These latter data have not yet been put in tbe hands of the drnughtsmen 1 owing to press of other work. When an opportunity occurs, however, the results obtained will be put in such shape as to make them available for study. In August, 1886, Lieut. J. E. PillslJur.r, tr. S. N., in the Blake, was engaged in developing the one-huudrnd fatliom curve off the coast of Delaware', l\Jaryland, and Virginia-a much-needetl additiou to our coasting charts of this locality. The smne party also made an examination of St. Simon's Bar and a surn-;y of a sect ion of the coast off New fol pt, North Carolina, during the year. The schooner Scoresby, Lieut. Francis Winslow, U.S. N., commanding, was engaged during the wliole year iu making au examination of the oyster-beds of the sounds of North Caro1ina. Tbe steamer Bachei under command of Lieut .·J. :F. Moser, U. S. N., who was detached from duty in this Office and assigned hy you as the relief of Vent<'nar.t Hawley in November, 1886, was unusually succesisful in her work iu tlte vicinity of Cedar Krys and Cape Romano, working under many difficulties. The work on the coast of J,onisiana was carried on in the Endearor, under command of Lieut. D. D. V. Stuart, U. S. N. Tbe work indu,led the smvey of the dredged channel in Atcbafalaya Bay, a survey in Vermilliou Bay, antl outside work.
GULF STREAM.

The investigation of the Gulf Stream was couthrned by Lieut. J. E. I'illsbury, U. S. N., in command of the Blake. Three s:ctious were occu1·ied during· the season-one from west end of Cuba to Yucatan, one from Uebecca Sltoal (Florida Keys) to Cul~a, and one extending to soutllwar<l and eastward from Cape Hatteras Shoal. The greatest depth in which an anchorage was made was iu the latter section-in one tb,ousaud eight hundred and fift,v-two fathoms of water, with over four knoti; surface current. 'I:hii,; is iu itself an indication of the perfection to which Lieutenant Pillsbur;r 11a8 brought the ground -tackle of the Blake for anchorage in great depths. The results obtained in the cross-sectious in and near Florida Straits tend to confirm the theories deduced duriug the seasons of l885-'l:i6 in relation to the daily aud monthly variation of the Gulf Stream, due to the advent of the tidal wave on this coast. Lieutenant Pillsbury's detailed and comprehensive report of the last season's work is now in your possession.
HYDROGRAPHY-PAOTFIC COAR'l'.

Lieut. U. F. Forse, U. S. N., witl1 a party in the Earnest, was engaged in work in Admiralty Inlet, Port Townisend Harbor, Po:s:sesi;ion Sound, aud Port Snsau, all in the waters of Washington Territory. 'The 1lJcA.rtl111r, Lieut. J. C. Burnett, U. s. N., commanding, in May and June, 1887, was engage11 in LJdrog1'aphic work off the coasts of Oregon and \Va1ihington Territory. In Uctouer, 188G, ~lr. U. Rockwell, Assistant Coast aud Geodetic Survey, made a survey of a portion of Columbia River from Oolnmbia City to Bachelor faland, Washington Territory, and in the same month Mr. L. A. Seng-teller, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was engaged in b~·drographic work in Umpquah River, Oregon. Au <l}'J·ropriation having liel·n made for tbe re-smvey of San }'rancisco Bay and its tributaries, Lieut. David Peacock, U. S. N., then in command of tbe Hassler, was assigned to the work, which was carried on from September, 1886, to the 21st of March, 1887. On the returu of the Alaska parties the servfoes of the officers, crews, and boats we.re utilized in this work, and Lieutenant-Commander Snow was given general charge of it.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The work, so far as completed, including Suisun and San Pablo Bays, was very close, it being desirable to ascertain the extent of the filling of these basins due to hydraulic mining near the shores of the rivers leading into them. Orr the detachment of Lieutenant-Commander Snow, Lieutenant-Commander Thomas was given charge of the work, and later it was assigned to Lieut. David Peacock, who continued it to the close of the season. In August, 18SG, Prof. George Davidson, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, made a bydrographic survey of Lompoc Landing, Santa Barbara County, Cal.
SUR.VEY OF ALASKA.

The result of the season's work of 1886 in Alaska was especially gratifying. The work was carried on by the Patterson, Lieut. Commander A. S. Snow, U.S. N., commanding, and the.McArthur, Lieut. J.M. Helm, U.S. N., commanding. Au area of sixteen hundred miles was covered, and over seventeen thousand fi rn hundred miles of soundings run by the combined parties. The work completed during tbe season included Clarence and Sumner and Wrangell Straits. Lieut. Commander Uhm:les M. Thomas, U.S. N., having relieved Lieutenant-Commander Snow in command of the Patterson, started for tlie working-ground to the north ward of Wrangell Straits in l\ia;y, 188i. While his repol't of this sea,,;ou':,; work i,,; not yet in, his letters indicate unusually ball weather in Alaska, and much of the work has been carried on in the rain, the instruments, when necessary, having been set up under awnings.
COAST PILOT DIVISION.

The work in the Coast Pilot Division, in charge of Lieut. G. H. Peters, U.S. N., assisted by Ensigns E. H. Tillman and W. J. Maxwell, U.S. N., and Mr. John Ross, has been pushed as rapidly as possible. It being desirable to have a condensed Coast Pilot to meet the needs of the mariner, sample pages of a scheme prepared by Lieutenant Peters, to illustrate the method of treatment suggested by him to cover in one volume the whole Atlantic coast, were submitted t-0 a number of experts for suggestions and criticism. The result being satisfactory, the scheme received your approval, and is now being followed in the work in the course of preparation. The field-work, or collection and verification of data, has received the attention necessary. Lieutenant Peters and members of his party were engaged in such work in Long Island Sound and on the eastern coast from April to June, the steamer Daisy being used for the purpose. The necessity of a new Pacific Coast Pilot has been apparent for some years. The manuscript of Prof. George Davidson, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, is now nearly all in, and it is hoped that this important work may be in shape to place before the public before many months. There are many new data affecting the comparatively unknown coast of Alaska now in the Office, and I intend at an early day to submit you a scheme for the new Coast Pilot for these waters. The report of Lieutenant Peters is forwarded herewith.
HYDROGR.A.PHIC DIVISION.

The Hydrographic Division of the Hydrographic Inspector's Office was in charge of Lieut.

J. F. Moser, U. 8. N., from tbe beginning of the fiscal year to No\·cmber 10, 1886, when he was
detached and ordered to command the Bache, thus retaining in another field of the Survey his valuable services. · Lieut. J. M. Hawley, U. S. N., then took charge of this Divh1ion, and he in turn was relieved OU April 27, 1887, by Lieut. .M. L. Wood, U.S. N. The duties of thi8 Division are numerous and exacting, consisting of laying out hydrographic work, examining and verifying the sheets as they come in from the field, and seeing that proper notification of all changes in aids to navigation and all hydrograpbic information that may be of interest to the navigator are given promptly. While the Hydrographic Inspector is charged with the immediate supervision of the preparation of such corrections and the giving of notification that they exist, the duty of mak-ing tlie corH. Ex. 17-10

rectiona, in order that the charts issued from the Office may show sach changes, is assigned to others. It is a question whether this divided responsibility is productive of the best results. The report of Lieut M. L. Wood, in charge of the Division, is forwarded herewith.
REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE OF COMPLEMENT OF VESSELS.

In Oct-Ober, 1886, a report was submitted by Lieut. Commander A. S. Snow, U.S. N., commanding the steamer Patterson, showing that the small steamer Lively that had been used for some years in the survey of Alaska, was in a condition that did not warrant her being repaired. She was an old vessel when her employment on this work began. With your approval, arrangements were entered into with the Bureaus of Construction and Engineering, Navy Department, for the building at Mare Island of a steamer fifty.five feet in length, with accommodation for three officers and a crew of five men. This steamer was completed in May and has been in every way satisfactory. On the passage up the coast she encountered a very heavy gale of wind, and separated from ber convoy, but proved herself a most excellent sea-boat. The commanding officer of the Patterson reports that she is of great service to bis party, adding materially to the amount of work done. The old Lively being of no further use to the Survey, I had the honor to recommend that she be sold, and bids were accordingly advertised for. During the year three steam-Iauncheo; have been completed for the Survey at diff~ent navyyards, one of them having been commenced in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1887. These launches are large, with fair speed, excellent sea-boats, and are in every way well adapted to hydrograpbic work. During the fall and winter the Gedney was thoroughly overhauled at Baltimore, Md., a new boiler was put in, nearly all the fastenings below the water-line replaced, they having been seriously injured by galvanic action, and a number of the frame and floor timbers renewed. She is now in condition for any work that may be assigned her. Owing to the large amounts expended for the repairs of the Gedney and for the new steamer for the .Alaska survey, great economy was necessary in keeping the other vessels of the fleet in good running condition without exceeding the appropriation; that this was done without serious inconvenience to the Survey was due principally to the fact that the reduced crews of the vessels laid up in New York were kept busy during the winter in making repairs to hulls, spars, sails, etc., rendering it necessary to expend money for material only. While possibly out.side of the province of this report, still my interest in the Survey and my knowledge of the necessity of bringing out at the earliest possible moment the results of the fieldwork induce me to urge that an appropriation be asked for to increase the number of draughtsmen and engravers at present employed by the Office. An inspection of the list of bydrograpbicsheets now on hand, the results of which have not yet been properly indicated ·on the coast and general coast charts, will at once -show how necessary it is that the increase should be ma.de. The duties of clerk to Hydrographic Inspect.or were performed in a satisfootory manner by Mr. George J. Vestner. As forming part of this report, I append at its close tabulated statements giving the names of naval officers attached to the Survey during the fh1cal year and on June 30, 1887; the number of offioors serving on board Coast and Geodetic Survey vessels at two periods of the year; the number · of men on those vessels, and the names of vessels belonging t:o the Service, their tonnage, etc. Also a table showing the localities· in which hydrographic work was done during the year, with the names of officers in charge of the parties, and details relating to their work. Very respectfully, W. H. BROWNSON, Lieutenant-Oommt111tder U.S. Naey, Hydrograpkio InBpector, Coast and Geodetic Suroey·· Mr. F. M. THORN, Superintffldent Ooast and Geodetic SuNJey.

REPORT OF THE COAST PILOT DIVISION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1887.

U. S.

COAST A.ND GEODETI<J SURVEY OFFICE,

W asltington, October 21, 1887. Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report, covering the work of the Coast Pilot Division during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1887. Under the general direction of the Hydro-graphic Inspector, the duties of this Division involve the execution of work both at the Office and in the field. A new (third) edition of the Atlantic Local Coast Pilot, Subdivision 13, has been put through the press and published. New editions of Subdivisions 6, 7, and 9 and the first edition of Subdivision 21 have been prepared and sent to the printer. Much other work has been done in connection with other volumes to be issued hereafter. The great care and accuracy necessary in this class of work render it laborious and exacting iu its require_ments. Sample Coast Pilot pages having been prepared by me in illustration of the method of treatment which I had proposed for such work, these page8 were printed. For the purpose of elicit· ing expressions of opinion and suggestions, a number of the printed copies were distributed among experts, whose careful attention and criticism were invited, with a \iew to the improvement of the plan and the excision of unnecessary matter. Much interest was taken in the subject, as shown by the responses received. While the suggestions made exhibit the variety of opinion which was to have been expected on minor points, the result, as regards the general features of the plan suggested, is gratifying. The method has received the Superintendent's approval for adoption in a volume to cover the Atlantic coast. Most excellent results have followed the use of the general form of interrogatories devised with a view to obtaining directly from the best local sources special information concerning our ports and harbors. Many matters of practical interest to mariners are covered by these questions; much of the information thus made available is not ordinarily accessible. The interrogatories, as prepared in the Coast Pilot Division, have been submitted by the Superintendent to responsible local authorities of a great number of places on the Atlantic coast, from Maine to Florida, with the request that the questions be referred to the persons best qualified to give the inforruation desired. It has been a matter of surprise to find how large a proportion of the papers thus sent out have called forth careful replies, frequently developing matters of special interest which might perhaps have been otberwhse overlooked. Verification in the field shows the general reliability of the information thus received, which is then incorporated in new editions and in new works. Putting the matter in shape for publiootion of course involvek careful scrutiny and much lalJor. 'rhe field-work of collection, revision, and verification of data bas been carried on from time to time, as necessary, under special instructions, and reports covering such work llave already been made. Ensign Maxwell was engaged in work of this nature on portions of the New England coast in December, 1886. In April, 1887, the steamer Daisy, being temporarily available, was assigned to the Coast Pilot piu-ty, and under my command was employed in the C.)ast Pilot work until June 28, 1887, in Long Island Souij,d and on the Eastern coast. A special report of this work has been submitted. The Daisy being required for other work, and the Endeavor having returned from Southern-waters and being available, the Coast Pilot party was transforred to her, and at the end of the fiscal year she was being refitted at New York to continue the work on the Eastern eoast. Mr. John B. Goode, jr., did clerical work in the Coast Pilot Division until he resigned in August, 1886. His duties were performed in a most commendable way. Ensign W .·J. Maxwell, U.S. N., asi;igned to duty in this Division in September, 1886, and Ensign E. H. TiUman, U.S. N., assigned in December, 1886, were still engaged on this duty at the end of the fiscal year. Mr. Tillman was on board the Daisy with mefromApril 19, 1887, until relieved in June by Mr.Maxwell, who was transferred to the Endeavor later in the mouth. Mr. John Ross, who bad already rendered valuable service in hydrographic parties of the Survey, waa eUlploye4 ~s a compiler in tbe Coast Pilot Division in September, 1886, and was

REPORT OF THE HYDROGBAPHIC DIVISION FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1887.

SIR: I

COAST .AND GEODETIO SURVEY 0FFICE1

lVashington, October 5, 1887. have the honor to submit the following report of the work performed by the Hydrographic Division during the year ending June 30, 1887. Lieut. J. F. Moser, U. S. N., was in charge of this Division from July 1, 1886, until November, 1886, when he was relieved by Lieut. J.M. Hawley, U.S. N., who remained until April 27, 1887, when he was relieved by myself. Tl.le draughtsmen assigned to this Division performing regular office work during the year are Eugene Willenbucher, W. C. Willenl>ucher, and F. O. Donn. Owing to the different classes of work, a comprehensive statement giving credit to each indiYidual for all the work performed by him is almost impossible. :M:uch of the most severe labor, such as correcting proofs of plates for engraved charts, and drawings for lithographed charts, verifying reductions for charts, comparing charts of the same locality, preparing data for correcting charts already published, and making tracings and projections for examinations of reported dangers, can not be shown in such a manner as to give a proper idea of the amount of labor and research involved. Statistics show that the amount of data passing through this Division is steadily increasing.

This season's work will be received at the Office beforq,the data from last year have been put in a shape for reference. In view of the schemes laid out for the coming season, I respectfully suggest the assignment of another draughtsman to this Division, so tbat the publication of cbarts will not run the risk of au additional delay by the inability of the hydrographic draughtsmen to keep the plotting and veriJ1 . cation of the origmal h:yd10g-raphic records ahead of the demand for the new data. Since it can not be decided exactly what data will l>e needed, or their va1ue for Mrrectiug charts determined, until the results are in a shape for comparison, it is necessary, for economy in laying out work, that the results of byclrograpbic surveys be plotted and inked as soon as possible after their receipt from the field parties. To show the extent and variety of work required from this Division and give an idea of . the labor involved, tl1e following is gi,'en as a partial list: To check all schemes for projected charts and project the plans for new charts in such a manner as will best assist mariners; to revise the bydrography of the reduced <lrawings for all charts, and

verify by comparison with the original hydrographic sheets and other data; to see that all hydro. graphic featnres on the drawings are derived from proper authoritJ·, and that all points necessary to mariners are Rhown in such a manner as to be used without danger of misconstruction; to verify the proofs of all charts, and indicate important corrections receiwd since the verification of the drawing; to obtain the correct position of buoys from the Light-House Board, and indicate changes in aids to navigation for which there has been proper authority received; to compare the charts covering any locality and see that they agree so far as scale and construction will allow; to keep copies of charts of localities where changes are liable to occur, in the hands of persons able to determine alterations iu physical features: to select the hydrogrnphic corrections of importance, and determine what investigation is necessary to ·secure proper data for intelligent action, and notify Chart Room of' the correction to be applied; to find out the localities needing surveys, resurveys, or examinations, and furnish the Hydrographic Inspector with a list on which to base estimates for appropriations for the next fiscal year ; to hunt up and obtain tlata from other sources outside the Survey, so as to embody the most recent and trustworthy information on the charts when published; to correspond with any person able to give authoritative bydrographic information, and use all knowledge to the best advantage, either for correcting charts or for indicating the need for future investigation; to make projections, tracings, or working sheets for examinations sufficient to allaw a survey to be made with the minuteness required for the individual case; to select the data from the archives of the Office, for each party to complete its work, lay out the schemes for projections, and keep the chiefs of' p:trties in the field supplied with necessary da.ta received from any source; to compare the original sheets sent in by chiefs of' hydrographic parties with their records, and with the instructions under which the work was performed, and see that all points laid out have been attended to and notes made for future reference and required examinations; to see that the sounding lines are so indicated and that the soundings are spaced in such a manner that no doubtful intervals exist, and that the hydrography agrees in its df-tails, and joins properly to connecting completed work; to keep the file of' standard charts up to date, and thus to have a copy of' the last print of each chart corrected to date for all information that has been received at this Office; to keep a rec>.-0rd of corrections applied to each chart in such a manner that the authority for any change can be found on file, and to supply the data for informing users of charts of important changes in :t Notice to Mariners, issued the last day of each month, giving the corrections that have be.en put on the charts since the last monthly notice. The following is a tabular statement of the work performed by the draughtsmen:

No. 6.-1887.

ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE SANDS AT THE EASTERN ENTRANCE TO VINEYARD SOUND.

By HENRY MITCHELL, Assistant.

W.A.SHING'.l'ON,

D. C., May 7, 1887.

SIR: I submit below a continuation of my discussion of the changes among the l\lonomoy

Shoals aud a table of results. Very respectfully, yours, HENRY MITCHELL, Coast and Geodetic Survey. Mr. F. M. THORN, Superint:endent Coast and Geodetic Survey.

MOVEMENTS OF THE S.A.NDS A'.l' 'l'HE EASTERN ENTRANCE TO VINEYARD SOUND.

In my report on "Monomoy and its Shoals," prnsented last year,· I did not attempt anything more than a historical sketch of the increase and advance of those obstructions, because the causes of change that we observed did not seem adequate to the effects that comparative surveys :revealed. But our physical studies in New York Harbor during the past year ha\·e discovered to ns a relationship of tidal stage to the resultant effect of tidal currents that throws new light upon old themes. t The report and its illustrations of last year show(ld th<.tt sands from the outside coast were tending towards the entrance to the Sound from both directions; but, that while the sands from the north were pressed into this entrance, those from the south were turned off on presenting themselves. One may recognize in this disposition of things a slow rotary motion or circular dtwelopment. Moreover, we have seen that while some of the shoals move on like dunes by the running over of sands from rear to front, others grow or extend, as if they were simply dumping-grounds; the Handkerchief on one side and the Point Rip on the other side of the entrance are instances of dumping-grounds, as opposed to the Pollock Rips and the Stone Horse, which are progressive. The question of practical interest is, do these movements and re-inforcements threaten to close the thoroughfare to commerce t We do not expect to answer this question now, but we propose to exhibit the evidence as we gather and digest it. The sands from the north press in, at the entrance, not simply because it offers a dead angle or pooliiet, but a.150 becawie there ia a. draugkt through to the southwestward. Our first step in this

It may seem at first glance upon our mav. (Diagram No. 1), that we have at the entrance to the Vineyard Sound, at least in em br_yo, the outside and inside bars of au "inlet" (as an opening througll the sandy cordon of our southern coast is ca.Iled), but, as we shall see, the conditions at tbis opening are peculiar. At the ''-inlet" the outer bar represents what is gone from the sandy cordon at the opeuing, while the inside bar, sometimes called the '·swash," is the ground-up sand delivered by the breakers to the flood current and dumped at the point where the fl.oOd current loses its power in the lagoon. The circus of shoals outside of the Monomoy Entrance is an encroachment from an iu~lependent source, as the comparative maps ..show. The least !Section i8 found on a curve extending from Monomoy Point, convex to the ocean, passing over Shovelfut Stmie Horse, and Point Rip to Great Point. On this sill the average depth (20 feet) is less than 50 and the area of section less than 60, per cent. of what is found at the narrow pass from laud to laud. 'fhe inside shoals belong to the same foreign force, but n·11resent the portion that has dashed across the battle-ground in the narrow pass where the currents were t-00 strong to permit a lodgment. Both of these sills are interrupted, or, perhaps, incomplete, but the im1itlt-\ i;ill (represented mostly by the Handkerchief) is more so than the outer one. There is no diflicultr in tracing upon Commander Brownson1s h_ydrograpbical sheet of 1883 a connecting ridge between Great Point, Nantucket, and Great Round Shoal, through which, at a distance of 5! nautical miles. N. 70° E (true) from Great l'oint Light, one finds the deepest channel

to be 61 fathoms at low water. This ample depth, under very close marking, might be found by the navigator, but the course has so many changes that, practfoally, the South Channel is good only for 4 fathoms with 2~ feet additional for rise of tide. This ridge ought to be closely watched. In our report of last year we inclined to the belief that the Great Ronncl Shoal stood firm; this, as the abutment of the ridge, should be tested by re-survey. Its breaking up would be, no doubt, an injury to the channel. The other exit from the Sound fa by way of channels through and past the Pollock Rips. These channels are well marked, but the greatest low-water depth is but 20 feet, with 4 feet or less of title additional. It is entirely possible that iu a very great southeasterly gale the breaker may be continuous, or overlapping, from Monomoy arouml through the Pollock Hips, the Twelve Feet Shoal, the Broken Rip, the Great Round Shoal, and along the "ridge" to Point Rip and Great Point. This outer sill of the entrance is a.bout 18 miles long, of which on1.r 3 miles may be crosse1l by heavy vessels in smooth weather. Before losing sight of our map (I) we must e.xplain that we call it the "Entrance to Vineyard Sound," because the title '; S antucket Sound" (first given, I think, by Lieut. Charles Henry Davis), bas ne\'er been adopted by the commercial world, and because our theme involves the entire water space sheltered by the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Yine;yard, and we must choose here the most comprehensive name iu use. " Th-e table we have given is from actual observations never before published, and t~e second diagram (Sketch No. 32) illustrates these observations in its second figure. The first figure of this diagram furnishes t,ypes of the tidal profiles for the two entrances of the Vineyard Sound from a combination of tlle observations at Powder Hole pronomoy) and Great Point (Nantucket) to represent the eastern entrance, and from observations at l\ienemsba Bight (under lee of Gay Ilead, Martha's Vineyard) to represent the western entrance. From this figure, one sees at a glance that the slopes (alternately eastward and westward) must be equal, for these are but serpentine cu.:ves with a common axis which is assumed to be mean sea-let·el. But it is also evident that the two slopes occur at different stages: The slope westward (IX~ to IIq) is in greater depth of water than the reverse slope (III~ to IX:D· The equal slopes are 3.54 feet each; the unequal stages differ 1.20 feet. My object, as will presently appear more distinctly, in presenting this general case, based on a long series, is to establish the fact that whatever may be the local contrasts from side to side at the eastern entrance, the net effect is a westwardly movement, because, notwithstanding that the slopes are equal in the two alternate directions, differences of velocity and discharge must result from the differences of sectional a.rca audperi1neter. "Scour" is work done by water flowing onr sands; it is therefore in proportion to the square of the velocity, and varies with section directly, and perimeter inversely, when other things are equal. ., In the second figure we have given actual observations only, and precisely as recorded, except that we have plotted the tidal profiles for ordinates measured from the mean level of the sea as well as we could determine it. In taking the tide of No Man's Land as representing the western entrance to the Vineyard Sound ·we are doing no violence to our case, because in a comparison at other dates when we happened to have simultaneous obserrntions at No Man's Land and at Gay Head (Menemsha Bight) it was found that the former station had the same time of tide as the latter and a little greater range. In this second figure of our diagram, the slopes are of course equal, east and west, being 2.37 feet in the average, but the western slope is, at an average stage, 0.27 foot above the eastern slope. The difference of depth over the Bill of the entrance which this higher stage represents seems insignificant-insufficient to account for the predominance of westwardly flow that the synchronoux observations in Butler's Hole reveal. But this is not the whole story; we h:we a. much stronger case than our convenient data support. As we have already said, the tides at the western entranee are really of less range than the sample from No Man's Land that ~e have given, and if ot1r ohservations had been made at Monomoy Point instead of the Powder Hole we should have found a range there nearly 25 per cent. greater. In short, if our stations had been located with special

H. Ex. 17-11

162

reference to our problem, we should have found the stage of the western slope more than 1.20 feet above its alrernative. And, furthermore, as our diagram .slwws disti11ctl_y, the maximum westerly current occurs at local hig-h water when the depth over tbe sill h; nearly 4 feet greater than at maximum easterly current about six hours later. Perliaps this is a proper place to explain that iu populnr usage the term "flood" is applied to the easterly current because "it makes hifJh water" in the Sounrl. It is convenient to remember tbe phenomena coincident with the transit or ''southing" of tlH\ moon as a key to the apparently occult tidal ssstem of this neighborhood. At the .~outhing of the nwon (nearly) it is hi!Jh 1cater on both siilcH nf Cape Cod and in that portim1 of the Hound lJing east of Vineyard Haven; it is slack tcater (turning from easterly to westerly flow) in the main cLa1rnel from Gay Head to the Hamlkerchief Shoal nearly; but down almig the outer coast of Oape Ood an1Z into the Sound tit rough Butler's Bole t71e ebb current (southerly and westerls) is already at its strength. Thus we see at tbe southing of the moon, when the tide is full, the sweepiugs from the outsi\le of Cape Cod are being dumpe(l into th~ still waters of the Sonnd. 'I'lie observations plotted in our Diagram II were made by my parts thirty years ago, and tlrn current observations of Butler's Bole, that so happily fit our present argument, bear the signature of "\Yilliarn H. Gardner, uow a well-known surgeon of the U. S . .Army, and always reliable. He was the actual observer at most of the important stations around Monomoy Shoals in 1857. 'rhe South Ch::nnel statious "e" and "f" give resultants tending seaward 'and with a different local slope, for we approach the node as we go southward. The shift from the Bay of Fundy system to the regular Atlantic tide occurs on an arc from the southeastern angle of Nantucket Island to Uape Sable, Nova Scotia. (See .A11pendix 10, Annual Report Uoast and Geodetic Survey for 1879.) The movements of the sand swept by tidal currents are often conspicuous, so that the casual observer may notice that the bottom is "alive;" but the motiou is usually much less rapid than that of the stream, so that the effect of one floo(l or ebb is not sufficient to carry it far from its original position, and the adverse stream may take it back. The ebb and flood currents are, however, rarely eqnal and opposite, so that the particles of sand, by long zigzags, make a gain one way. Our method is to observe the velocities and directions of the currents every half hour for a full tidal day (24k honrs), arnl then make a composition of them as if they were synchronous forces. The following tahle gives our results, which are consistent with the historical data furnished last year, although no corrections for range and stage have been introduced.

moV"ement is part of a convolution confined somewhat to the neighborhood of this entrance to the Vineyard Sound, which forms a sort of pocket. There iR no whirl, except in ultimate resultant effect. vVe have been tempted to trace upon our map the locus of this movement, but hardly dare do so yet. The most unexpected result of this new computation is, that what appeared inconsistent in the movement of Little Round Shoal as breaking the general order of march in our historical sketch of last y~r, now seems quite probable under our dynamic scheme. _ The Handkerchief looks, upon the chart, as if it might be a broken part of Monomoy, but it never joined on, that we can learn. The slough channel that separates them tlid so from the beginning. The shoal building has not been here a growing and traveling dune, but here has been tbe dumping-ground for Butler's Hole in its vain endearnr to keep itself free. It will be remembered that we showed last year that this channel had lo.st half its width by encroachment from the north; but had made up for it in some part by excavating its bed. Among tidal currents where ebb and flood repeat and reverse each other's velocities and directions very nearly, we should expect to find channels and shoal-ridges lying somewhat transversely to the general course of the two streams, because the resultant is the diagonal of a very obtuse angle. The shoals are prone to lie in windrows. As we have seen, the variation of dt.>ptb, or change of "stage," is a potent cause of inequality of el.Jb and flood velocities in confined cl!annels, it is therefore productive of resultants. To offer a very patent instance: we find on the outside of Monorrroy and Chatham that the southerly (ebb) current reaches its maximum at high water, so that it alone sweeps the upper part of the strand and probably runs fastBr than its alternative all along the breaker belt. Now the breaker belt, i. e., the strand uncovered by the falling tide and the shallow aproning adjacent, is the proximate source of supply of tlie shoal-building and. beach-building materials. It is here that the earth torn from the cliff is ground up and assorted. The fine gra(le i:s taken off by the current in suspension to build fiats and salt marshes in tranquil and sheltered place:s, but the next coarser grade is rolled or swept along slowly. The shingle alone resists tbe current and awaits the storm seas. Where the waves habitually drive on diagonally they themselves urge forward masses of sand and are often more potent than the tidal currents, so that beaches are extended where no tidal currents sweep the strand. Comparative hydrography, it would seem, should begin with the survey of the clUf, strand, and aproning. It is not the ambitious way, but it is the slow and sure one. I am indebted to Assistant George A. Fairfield and especially to Messrs. E. E. Haskell and Tiomer P. Ritter for computations and drawings to a far greater extent than this report may indi· cate; because although we have rejected no data that we had bearing upon the points here discussed, we have tried many other themes where our data promised more than they fulfilled.

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE LEYEL OF LAKE CHAMPLAIN AND AVERAGE HEIGHT OF ITS SURF ACE ABO VE THE SEA.

A

Preliminary Report by CHARLES A. SCHOTT, Assistant.

COMPUTING DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

October 10, 1887. The subject of the :fluctuations, annual and secular, as well as temporary, of Lake Champlain, (lemanded the attention of the Coast and Geodetic Survey when it became necessary to decide upon some determinate level to which the soundings of the lake, taken in different months and years, should he reduced as standard level. Closely connected with this inquiry was the question of the average elevation of the lake above the half-tide or mean level of the ocean. Up to the present time the average elevation of the lake above the ocean, as given by various authorities, was generally confined within the limits of !JO and l 00 feet; thus we find in IT. Gannett's Dictionary of Altitudes (Washington, 1884), elevation of Lake Champlain, 91 fc>et (authority, Adirondack Survey), and 101 feet (authority, railroad reports). In Lippiucott's Gazetteer (Philadelphia, 1882), we :find the statement "tbe surface is 93 feet higher than the lernl of the sea." In the seventh annual report of tbe Adirondack Survey, for 1879, the superintendent of that survey gives 99.31 feet, but in a letter to this Office dated June 26, 1887, he says "the mean 11eight of Lake Champlain, hy my measurements is 96.56 above mean tide level at Governor's Island, New York Harbor." This last statement is not far from the truth, and we are promised shortly by Mr. V. Colvin, Superintendent Adirondack Survey, a 1mblication of his researches.· Much more vague have been the statements as to the greatest depth of the lake. ·while the new American Cyclopredia. (New York, 1859) 1 gives the greatest depth 282 feet, a value which is reproduced in Johnson's New Universal Oyclopredia (New York, 1875), the Lippincott Gazetteer (Philadelphia, 1882) states that the greatest depth ascertained is 600 feet. In the years 1870-'74 the Coast Survey sounded out the lake and publiRhed its survey in four sheets in 1879 and 1880; here we find the deepest sounding indicated, viz, 399 feet oft' Wing's Point in about latitude 440 18', longitude 730 19'. The adopted JJlane of reference on these charts is half a foot above an extreme low water (observed between 1870-'74),t and this level of reference I now find to be a.bout two feet and a half below the average level of the lake as observed <lnring
·Letter of July 25, 1887, addressed to this Office. t The word "ever" occurring in the notea explanatory of the level of reduction should be struck out as too general.

the period 1871 to 1882, hence the greatest depth may be said to be 402 feet, and consequently 1·arts of the bottom of this lake basi-n descend more than 300 feet below the level of the Atlantic Ocean. The irregular, periodic, and secular variations in the lake level as observed dmiug twelve Jears indicate a total range of 8 feet at the northern outlet of the lake, and no doubt this range is greatlJ' exceeded at points near its opposite extremity, since strong an-U continuous nOl'therly winds would drive the water into the narrower, southern parts of the lake, heaping it up there, while southerly winds could not do this in the wider, northern part of the lake where it is free to discharge its surplus waters through the Sorel or Richelieu River. This outlet is quite shallow; the maximum depth at low stage of the river and where it is crossed by the Canadian boundary line is but 181 feet and its width is three-quarters of a statute mile. As early as 1857 the Uoast Survey undertook to carry a line of spirit levels from New York to Albany for the purpose of studying the influence of the slope of the Hudson River anfl of its variations in profile, on the time of propagation of the tide up the river and upon the shape of the tidal wave during its progress. The results of these levels were afterwards utilized by the U.S. Lake Survey as a step in the operations which determined the heights of the Great Lakes and c>xtendcd their influence even as far as Saint Louis, Mo., where a satisfactory rough first check was had by comparison with the lines of spirit levels carried by the Coast and Geodetic Survey from Sandy Hook, New Jersey, through Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, etc., to the MisHiBsippi River. The Adirondack State Survey a1so availed itself of these levels. In 1876 and 1877 the spirit levels were extended to meet the requirement of supplying check data for the determination of 11eights for the triangulations in New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, ancl ~ew Hampshire. 'l'llese operations were in charge of .Assistants R. D. Cutts and 0. H. Tittmann. In 1882 the latter observer carried the line of spirit levels northward along the Champlain Canal as far as Putnam Station, N. Y., where he extended his work by means of water levels, covering the whole length or the lake, and thus gave the iirst means of determiniug the absolute height of the lake and consequently also that of the plane of reference used in the hydro graphic surveys of 1870-'74. In connection with tllis work it was a fortunate circumstance that the Survey could avail itself of a series of daily observations of the water level made at Fort l\fontgomery, near Rouse's Point, at the northern extremity of the lake. This series was made nuder the direction of the e. S. Engineers, and the Survey is indebted to the Chief of Engineers, U. S. A., and to Maj. M. B. Adams of the Engineer Corps for transmitting a certified copy of the record, which extends o>er nearly eleven years, commencing with March, 1871, and ending with September, 1882. It does not appenr that the series has been cliscussed before. The preface to the record book reads as follows: "The following record shows the water level of Lake Champlain for the date indicated. The figures in the last column show height of water surface in feet and decimals above zero at Fort Montgomery, which zero is 1.5 below top of base course of scarp wall, at the left re-entrant angle of Bastion E, at the outer en<l of lake postern. When water surface is below zero the fact is noterl. The ahov1, Hote was added to this book at Fort Montgomery on August 9, 1882, and was read to ·wmiam McComb, the fort keeper, by whom the observations were made, and was approved by him as correct; signed, William P. Judson, Assistant Engineer (and dated) U.S. Engineer Office, Fol't l\Iontgomery, August 9, 1882." From this record monthly means were formed and tabulated as below. Fluctuations of the level of Lake Champlain, as shown by monthly means from daily observations made by the U.S. Eng'ineers at Fort Montgomery, N. Y., between the years 1871and1882.-Tbe values are expressed in feet and give the mean of the readings of the water level on a fixed staff graduated from zero upwards; interpolated va..lues are inelosed in parentheses.

The few interruptions in the monthly means of the earlier ;years are due to obstructions b,Y ice. The means for seven complete years are int.rocluced for tlie purpose of interpolation, Yiz: JTor January and February, 1871, we note tllat the observed yalues for March and April, 1871, are OH the average 0. 71 foot in excf'ss of tlie corresponding values in the seven-year series, 0.71 was therefore added to the Januar~' and February Yalnes of the latter series and the respecti,-e result;; rnserted for 1871. Similarly for De0ember, 1871, and January, 1872, the October and Nowmlwr values for 1871 were on the average 0.:.!2 foot abo,-e the corresponding seven-year meairn, and tliat amount was added to the December and January means of that series to obtain the interpolated tahnlar values; in like manner the April and l\Iay values were employed to give the interpo!:ltwrn; for February and March. The remaining interpolations were made on the same principle. The monthly means for the perio<l of twelve yea1·s were then inserted in the last line, which shows :

The annual variation in the lei·el of Lake Champlain, 1871 to 1882.
By subtracting the general mean reading 2.64 from each of the monthly means we ohtain t11e mean annual variation in the surface of the fake. A plus sign signifies elevation, a minim sign depreesion in the surface as compared with the average state during the twelve years.

Hence during March, April, May, and June the lake is higher than its average stage and in the remaining months lower. It must, however, be remembered that our series is short and that this conclusion needs qualification. The maximum elevation in May finds its obvious interpretation as the effect of the melting of snow anll il)e accumulated within the drainage area of the lake during the preceding wfo.ter, and the minimum in February is due t.o the freezing up of water-

courses which otherwise would feed the lake, bnt the apparent principal minimum in the month of October could not be so readily explained, and its cause is rather obscure. It then appeared to me dt>sirable to compare the state of Lake Ontario with that of Lake Champlain. For this purpose the monthly means of the gauges of that lake were extracted from the annual reports of the U. S. Lake Sun'ey (from Reports of Chief of Engineers from 1876 to 1881), and tabulateu as follows: Fluctuations ·in the level of Lake Ontario, .~ho11m by monthly means from observations at Charlotte Harbor, a.~ a representatfre station, between the years 1859 and 1881.-The tabular figures give the depression of the surface below a fixed plane of reference, i.e., a supposed high stage of 1838, and are expressed in feet and decimals. The series is made complete by interpolated values for certain months in the first and in the last year of observation. These values are indicated by parentheses. Thus the seven ·observed 1alues for 1859 are, on the average, 0.91 fo.ot below therr corresponding montl1ly meam; in the twenty-one-year series; hence the interpolated values for the first five mouths of 1859 are the respecti1e values in tbe twenty-one-year series diminished by 0.91 foot. 'rhe last year of the series was made complete in a similar way.

The annual variation in the height of Lake Ontario is here brought out with much greater regularity and distinctness, as might be expected from the longer series, as compared with that of Lake Champlain. The minimum occurs in February and thus supports the SUl'mise that the same is the case for Lake Champlain and that the October low water of the latter Jake is accidental and would disappear in a longer series of observations.

The waters of Lake Ontario rise steadily from February to June, when the highest stage of the year is reached. The total or mean range is 1.43 feet, whereas Lake Cbaruplain fluctuates 2. 75 feet between February arnl May, as migbt be expected frou1 the uarrmnwss of tbe lake. It can be shown that the annual Yariation of Like Ontario follows quite closely the >ariation in the rainfall, excepting that the small October rise in the amount of precipitation.is not refiPctt><l in the variation of the lake. The following figures of ratios of the month!:- mean rain-fall are taken from my diflcussion of the aqueous precipitation in the United States published by the Smithsonian ·Institution, second edition, Washington, 1881, pages 198, 190, type II. for twenty-seven stations iu western New York:·

A comparison of the state of Lake Champlain with the amount of rain (and melted snow) at Burlington, Vt., during the years 1871-1882 is not so conclusive, the raiu-fa11 at any one station being too local a phenomenon to be a reliable index for adjacent localitie:_.:. I ham extracted and tabulated the following figures from the annual reports of the Chief Signal Officer; they give the observed precipitation in inches for the Burlington station established in May, 1871. The observations cov:er the same period during which the height of the lake was gauged. ------···---------------,------,-------c--------------~---------

"These ratios sum np to twelve for the total of the year; to convert them into absolute measure or inches mul· tiply by three, very nearly.

Accordingly on the average of twelve years the precipitation at Burlington shows a minimum in February and a maximum in July. Reverting to the anomaly of a low state of the lake in about the month of October, that peculiai'ity is most pronounced in the year 1880. During the first half of that year the lake was above the average height nearly ha.If a foot; in July it lowered and stood for the second half of the year one foot and two-thirds below that level. This extraordinary depression was supposed to be due to the effect of winds, but tbese would only partially and indistinctly respond, as may be seen from the following set &f figures, showing the relative frequency of observed northerly (NE., ------------------··------ - - - -

Thus in October, 1880, the southerly winds blew with greatest frequency as compared with northerly winds, and corresponding theret-0 we find the greatest depression of the lake level. 'l'he extreme fluctuation of the level of Lake Champlain as observed between March, 1871, and September, 1882, is noted as follows: Highest stage, May 18, 1876, reading of staff 7.85, equal to 5.21 feet above average level. Lowest stage, October 12, 1880, reading of staff -0.U equal to 2.78 feet below average level. Hence total range observed at Fort Montgomery 7 .99, or about 8 feet, aud it will be shown that in an extreme case the soundings on the chart published by this Office may have to be increased by this amount. Secular variation in the level of Lake Champlain. Any inquiry into the non-periodic fluctuations in the annual mean levels for a series of years ruay, at this time, appear premature, yet we shall present what information we have and supplement the same by a similar inquiry respecting the changes noted from year to year in Lake Ontario, as tbis may possibly help to extend the scanty material for Lake Cham plain at present available. The annual means for tlie beights of both lakes are already given in the last column of our tables, and when plott{;d · indicate a certain correspondence in the secular variation, commenciug with the year 1S73. This wm1ld bring the lakes under similar climatic conditions, and would pt~r mit the inference that, as in Lake Ontario, since the earliest records in 1859, a gradual shbsidence in the level has taken place, the total secular lowering being somewhat less than 1 foot. Tliis ftuctuation is gh'en by the following numbers, found by eubt:actiug 2.64 from the individual annual means in the case of Lake Champlain, and by subtracting the individual annual means from 2.47 in the case of Lake Ontario. A plus sign will then 1ll(licate for either case a higher Btage, a minus sign a lower stage than the average.

The gradual change from the positive to the negative figures in each series is significant. of the character of the secular change. It is, howeYer, only by continued observations that. further advances can be made in tbis inquiry, which itself is linked together and interlaced with the subject of secular changes in the rain-fall and of the climate in general. The accompanying illustrations of some of the principal results require no further remarks. The absolute height of the lake above the ocean. The absolute height of Lake Champlain when in an average state, as measured by the watergauge at Fort Montgomery between 1871 and 1882, may now be closely approximated. Tbe fol· lowing data are available for this purpose: Bench-mark on grist-mill at Greenbush, OJ)posite Albany, N. Y., above the half-tide or average level of the ocean, 4111 .489 or 14.73 feet. This result depends on tidal observations in New York Harbor, by the Coast SurYe.r, at Go;ernor's Island, between 1852 and 1879, inclusive (comprising, therefore, one and a half revolutions of the moon's nodes), and on spirit-leveling along the eastern side of the Hudson River, bJ J.B. Vose, in 1857-'58,· and resumed by 0. H. Tittmann in 1877. This same bench-mark was the starting point (le>el) for the determination of the heights of the Great Lakes (Professional Papers, Coqls of Engine.ers, No. 2'1, p. 608). In 1882 Assistant Tittmann resumed the leveling operations for the connection of Albauy with the lake. The line started from Albany, at Lock No. 1 of the Erie Canal, the height of which he had determined in 1877, viz: Miter-sill at southeast gate of lock, above mean sea leYel, -lrn .873 or -6.145 feet. He then followed the tow-path of the Champlain Canal to White Hall, N. Y., and thence carried the line along the track of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Compan;y's Railroad as far as Putnam station. There a water-gauge and mark was established and connected with others placed at Port Henry, Plattsburgh, Burlington, and Rouse's Point. Ile makes B. l\I. No. 40, cut in the railroad culvert at Putnam, to be 32m.536 above B. M. at Lock 1; the absolute l!eight of No. 40 is therefore 3om.663 and the zero of his water-gauge 30m.048, the latter being om.615 below this mark. Simultaneous observations were made by means of these gauges of the stage of the
"The zero,of gauge at Governor's Island was transferred to mark on Hudson River, foot of Eighteenth street,

lake surface for fifteen consecutive days, November 4 to 19, at the hours 8 a. m., noon, and 5 p. m. The zero of each gauge was referred to a permanent bench-mark established near it. These gauges were each 4 feet long and graduated from top downward. ·we have: Mean water-level, November 4-18, 1882, correspornJs to reading 0.995 on the Putnam gauge; this mean level, therefore,, is 29ru,053 above the ocean, and corresponds to the reading om,34;3 of the Rouse's Point gauge. This places tlie zero of the Rouse's Point gauge 29m.896 a hove the ocean, aml siuee the Rouse's Point bench-mark on Chapman's Block, north side, is 3m,649 above ii, the latter is 33m,545, or 110.06 foet above the mean sea-level. This mark has been proposed for an international bench-mark for the connection of the American and Canadian spirit levels in this
P~gion.

According to .Assistant Tittmann the Chapman Block bench-mark is 1m,350 above the level of }1eel ofloop-Lole of Bastion A, Fort Montgomery, which is also known as the hytlrographic !Jeuch111ark of tl1e fort, and this bydrographic mark is 2m.925 above the U. S. Engineers' bench-mark, "\) hich is the lewl of base course of scarp wall of Rastion B; * the latter is therefore 29m.270 ahoYe tl1e mean sea-level. The zero of the Engineers' water-gauge being one and a half feet below this r·1ark, and the average readings of the water-level between ]871 and 1882 (vide preceding tabli>) l·eing 2.64 feet, we have finally the height of the average lake level above the mean sea-l·wel !J.Jrn.618, or 97.17 feet. Pending spirit-leveling between the Putnam and the Rouse's Point marks and further observations of the lake level for a series of years, this result may be accepted as a close approximation to the true value. I estimate its probable error or uncertainty at about ± 0.3 foot (exclusive of uncertainty due to secular cliange). We can now also determine the height above the ocean (mean tide) of the level of reference adopted on the Coast Survey charts of the lake; thii level has reference to a· gauge and mark at Plattsburgh, and computation shows that the chart-plane ver,v nearly corresponded to the zero of the Engineers' gauge at Fort llfoutgomer.r (was about om.02 ab0\7 e it); this plane of reference consequently is Ycry nearly 28m.83, or 94.6 feet above the mean level of the Atlantic, and is also om. 78, or 2.56 feet below the average level of the lake, period 1871-1882. No investigations bearing on the distribution of temperature of the wateni of the lake have been made, as far as known. The l'olation of temperature to depth down to 400 feet, and the depth to which the diurnal and the imuual fluctuations of the temperature of the superincumbent air are propagated, could not but prove interesting and valuable as physical facts. Respecting tides it is hardly necessary to remark that no measurable amountt can exist in this hke in consequenc0 of its small size and inconsiderable mean depth and width. The present preliminary investigation of the height of the bench-mark at Ronse's Point was u.ndertaken at the instance of the Department of Public Works, Ottawa, the secretary of that o.epartment being anxious to connect his levelings with one of our marks of precise levels.

----------------------------------------------

*This same level is designated by Assistant Tittmann "water-sill level at the fort." t The suliject of tides in large lakes and of some kindred phenomena of oscillations has received tbe attention of the U. S. Lake Survey, and reference to it may be found in some of the annual reports; e.g., that of 1872 cvutains a very valuable discussion on the tides observed at Milwaukee, Wis., by General C. B. Comstock. Both the solar and lunar components of the tides are sensible in Lake Superior and in Lake Michigan; in the latter case the ranges are 0.05 foot, or 1cm .5, and 0.08 foot, or zcm.4, respectively, for the two luminaries. Spring and neap tides and other tidal features are plainly brought out.

GULF STREAM EXPLORATIONS-OBSERrATlOXS OF CUl\RENTS-1887.
A Report by Lieut. J.E. PILLSBURY, U.S. N., Assistant.

U. S.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY STEAMER BLAKE,

September 19, 1887. t: Srn: I hnve to make the following report of the sea,son's work of the bydrographic party under my command, in continuing the inveJtigation of the Gulf Stream currents. The Blake left New York ou January 11, and, after a stormy passage, reached Key West, and commenced the observations. The only alteration in the ancboriug gear from that in use last year, bas been to place the i·eel carrying the anchoring wire rope below decks. A room was bulkheaded off from the forward coal· bunker, and tlie reel securely fastened in this room to beds placed on tlie sister keelsons. 'l'he brake governing the reel in payiug out the rope was held down lly weigbts on the end of the lever, and by a line leading from the lever to the upper deck, the friction was controlled from the latter point. This was adopted in order to avoid confm;ion or mistakes, which, by the use of signals to the men stationed at the reel, would probably occur. The throttle of the engines reeling up the wire rope on its reel was also governed on the upper deck, so that one man could attend to the whole operation of paying out pr heaving in and reeling up the wirt>, and ho was on the upper deck where be cortlcl be under the immediate direction of the commanding oflicei·. Two men were stationed in the reel.room, whose duty it was to keep the machinery oiled and I-.> guide the rope smoothly on the reel as it revolved. The diameter of the rope was less this year than before, one-half inch (in diameter) being th·l one used. This size presents about one.fifth less surface aud this difference is very marked in tirn strain caused by the skin friction. Only once did it carry away during the season. The anchor became caught on the bottom, probably in a coral rock, and it was with the greatest difficulty that it could be broken. The current meters were the same as were used last year, except that the registers of the velocity were renewed, and the new ones were so graduated that the readings could be made more oo.sily and with less chance of error. In order to distinguish the cross-sections 1muth of the initial one (cross-section A at Fowey Rocks) from those to the northward, I have given them double letters. Illustration No. 34 shows all the cross-sections in the .. project for the development of the Gulf Stream. This has alrea<ly boon submitted to you, except a line.marked EE, and the lines drawn between the islands of the Caribbean Sea. These additions fo the scheme I believe to be necessary for the full development of the Gulf Stream, aud will explain my reasons for this conclusion later in the report. In presenting the most noticeable features of this year's observations, I shall venture to draw your attention also to the connection between this year's work and that of the previous years.

'While a report is supposed to be confined only to operations completed since the last report was made, yet a better understanding will be gained by comparing all the observations. Tile first two years were devoted to rnvestigating the currents of section A, the narrowest part of the Stream, with the object in view of ascertaining the laws governing the flow. This year's investigations have been made at three sections, and I think that, viewing the latter with the light of the former, an interpretation of the record can he made with considerable certainty, in spite of the fact that the observations on the sections this year are not so numerous. The sect10ns occupied this season were CU, between Rebecca Shoal and Onba ; DD, between Cape San Antonio, Cuba, and Yucatan, and section F, from Cape Ha\teras Shoal in a direction about southeast. All of these sections are of much greater depth than ever before attempted, and not the least gratifying feature of the season's work was our ability to anchor expeditiously and :safely in these depths. The greatest was off Cape Hatteras in 1,852 fathoms, and that, too, with a surface current of over four knots. I shall take up the different subjects in this report iu the following order: 1. General characteristics and limit of the Stream at each cross-section. 2. Daily variation. 3. Axis of the stream. 4. Depth of the stream and velocity at different depths. 5. Comparison of results obtained at various sections.
!.-CROSS-SECTION

1. General characteristics and limit of the Stream. The cnrreuts at this entrance to the Straits of Florida lrnvc beeu long known to mariner/to be extremely crmtie. Vessels sometimes have an easterly current alollg the Florida Banks, and sometimes a westerly current. Sometimes they are set toward the hauk, and again toward the middle of the Stream. These variable currents are to be expected west of " the Elbow," but the width of the variable zone i:s much wider west of American Shoal t!iau it is east of that point. Vessels in passing across the channel between RBbecca Shoal and Tortngas experience, generally, a northerly or southerly set. Mans think that. a large portion of the Gulf Stream water enters the strait through this passage; aud many more are of the opinion that the predominating current is norther!~·, and give this as a reason why so many vessels are wre"ked ou Southwest Reef at Loggerhead Key. To settle these questions, therefore, I established three stations in the vicinit~-, and 1ilaced a reference tide-gauge at Rebecca Shoal light-house. One station, "a," was near Rebecca Shoal; station "b" was near the western side of the passage, and 1'tation "c" was on the bank, situated about 5 miles west of Loggerhead Key. Statious "a'' and "h" were occupied twice each. I found the current setting practically north with tile flood tide and south with the ebb, in the passage betweeu Rebecca Shoal anti Tortugas. The currents are shown by curves.and the directions by arrows on Illustrations Nos. 35, 36, and 37. .All northerly currents are plotted above the zero of velocity, and southerly currents below the same zero. At station "c" the ob:<ervations show that there was a southerly set which overcame the lesser flood tide, so that for eighteen hours it was runuiug south. The flood tide, however, was indicated during this time by a decrease in the"'velocity of the southerly set. Sta.tion No. 1 of the cross-section was situated 18 miles distant and nearly south of Rebecca Sho:d, and was about 3 miles outside the 100-fathom curve in a depth of about 240 fathoms, (Illustration No. 42). Here, also, the tidal action was noticed, causing a very irregular current. Only once during the three times we anchored at this locality did the current set with regularity to the eastward, and then only in tbe upper strata. It is probable that this station is at least 10 miles from the usual northern limit of the Stream, and, although there may be a slight eastern tendency to the flow, it is so slight and variable that the interference of the tides and winds easi1y overcomes it. Tl1ere are indications in the record that, with the flood tide, the easterly set predominates. On anchorage 1 and 1· (Illustration No.

35) there seems to be a somewhat regular change following the tides. Separating the curves into their component parts towanl the cardinal poiuts of the compass, Urn curves of the east and west components at No. 1 show decided fluctuations at flood and ebb. No. 1a happened to be at, a time wllen the tide-gauge at Rebecca showed a ver_y irrrgular ti<le, and the currn shows a like inegularit,y. At No. Jb (Illustration l\o. 36) tlie directions at the smface, at l;') fathoms~ :tt 30 fathoms, aud - at 65 fatlloms, with one exception, are all to the eastward. At 130 fathoms the flow was found to be southnly and nOl'therly, the change in directiou comiug two or three lionrs after high and low water. The tide-gauge at Hebecc·i "l'l"ar;, nnfort1111atcl,r, do'\\ll at thi>; tinw, lmt for the times of the high and low waters the prediction tahles are probably ~ufficiently close for om· uee<ls. Station ~o. 2, which is about W miles south of No. 1 aud 34 mih; from Rebecca Shoal, has also very incguhtr currents. At the first anel10mge the surface tlirectio11 w:is l'asterlj·; at rn fathoms aud 30 fathoms \"ery irregular; and at 6.) and 130 fathoms deptl.J all were southerly, witb but one exception at each depth. At No. 2" (Illustration No. 37) tlH:0 surface wa:o; irrt·gular, bu6 the southerly flow predomiuated. At the other depths the sonthet'lj· flow was al way:; found, wit\ t the exception of two observations, one at 15 fathoms when the current was EXE., and one at 3J fathoms when it was E. by N. These anchorages (~os. 2 and za) were at aboL1t the time of zer11 declination of the moon, and there is a marked similarity rn the observations. Tim next time the station (No. 2b) was occupied, the surface, 15 fathoms, and 30 fathoms flow was steadil~· to tlH sontlmard and eastward, while at the lower depths it was irregular in direction, hut the souther] \T predominated. Uomparing the three sets of observations according to strength of currents, it i > seen that the stmnger the current the more constant the direction. No. 2h had the greatest velocity, and tlte upper stratum flows regularly, while the lower and weaker currents are irregular. No. 2 i3 the next in order of strength, and we see that its surface is fairly regular iu direction, the intermediate strata irregular, and the lower strata setting south. No. 2· is the weakest of all. Its surface is irregular in direction, while all the water below fiows southerly.

From this table it is seen that the stronger the current the deeper is the stratum flowing tl'I the eastward, and the lower down we have to go to find the southerly set, or the irregular flow whicl 1 is between them. The Stream in its daily and monthly variation carries a varyiug qnautity ot' water, and consequently either its limits or its velocity must change. The latter we know is th 'J fact; but from the observations at this station we see that the limit change~ also, and probably at all parts of the Stream where there is room for an expansion it takes place, spreading out on th.; surface to a greater width as well as increasing in velocity. The St1·eam at thi., section does not touch the banks or the bottom, except, possibly, on the Cuban side, and that but rarely, and the surface limit is therefore continually changing its position. This station is very near the average edge of the Stream. Sometimes tidal action extends to and beyond it toward the middle of the Straits, and sometimes it is to the northward of it. Ordinarily, on the surface, an easterly or southerly set may be expected. The first time the station was occupied, which was at about zero declination of the moon, probably the edge was nearer the anchorage than at the other times. The surface flow only, was easterly, but it was constant. At times the velocity would increase a knot or more in ten or fifteen minutes, and return again to it-s original speed. The wind was from the eastward, and the vessel was generally lying. broadside-to. She would suddenly tail to the current, and the pole would show the increai;ed speed, but in a very short time the vessel would swing back again to her original position, and the current would lose its speed as suddenly as it had gained it. It seemed as if the edge of the stronger current was snake-like, and sometimes the convex part would reach our position, causing a momentary increase.

The same effect would have been caused by the anchor dragging steadily over the bottom, and then suddenly mp, but I am positive the anchor did not drag, for whenever such was the case, the accumulator rubbers, being released from their pressure~ would canse the anchoring boom to jump in st1ch an unmistakable manner that there was never a doubt on the question. Anchorage No. 2"' was outside the limit, or rather the limit of the Stream was to the southward of the anchorage, and at No. 2b it was to the northward. Stations Nos. 3, 3:!, 4, 4z, and 5 need no special mention under this head, but attention will be drawn to them under the head of axis of the Stream, and also under monthly variations. 2. .Daily variati<m. The daily variation at Section CO is a.s marked as at Section A, and with no greater irregulari· ties in point of time than are found in the tides in most harbors. There were eight maximum velocities, arriving at a mean time of 9h 18m before the upper transit of the moon, and three arriving at a mean time of 3h 25m after the transit. These times are from the mean curves, which are constructed the same as last year, by taking one-fifth the sum of the readings of each current curve for each hour. The surface current may have been abnormal at a given time, therefore the mean of all the different strata, it is thought, will show more nearly the time of the normal variation. The regular variations at this section are not as excessive as at the other sections, but this is to be ex:pected, as will be seen later in the report in the comparisons of the different curves. The time of the '' establishment" at this section coincides very closely with that found at Section A, the latter being 911 09m before and 3h 37m after the transit. It is probable that there is actually a slight difference in the times of the establishment at the two points, but to determine it with exactness would require many more observations than it is possible to obtain without a great expenditure both of time and of money. I think, however, for the practical purposes of navigation, we may place the" establishment" at Section CC at 9b 2om before and 3h mm after the transit. 3. A,rfa of the Stream. · The axis of the Stream at this cross-section, or the point at which the surface velocity is the i;trongest, is best shown by the horizontal curves, Illustration No. 38, Fig. 1. It will be noted that the lower part of the curve at station 1 represents a minus current. This station being outside the limit of the true Stream, tl!e velocities were separated into their components, toward the four cardinal points of the compass, and the east and west components were used in the curves. The obiservatious show a strougcr current at station 4 than at any other point, but they were taken" at a higher declination of the moon than any of the others. Fig. 2, on the same plate, sliows b. mean cnrve of all the observations taken at each station, in a broken black line antl an imaginary currn in a thin black line, in the com;truction of which an allowance has been made at various stat ions for an increase in velocity according to the declination of the moon. This places the axis hetwecn stations 3 and 4. Tbe direction of the flow of the water on the surface, at this section, was entirely different from the other sections thus far examined ; on all the northern stations the average direction was to the south ward of east, and on the southern stations it was to the north ward of east.

4. Depth of the Stream and the velocity at different deptlis. Illustration No. 39 shows the profile of the Florida Straits at this section and the vertical curves at their stations, but revolved 900 from the true direction of the fiow, so that they can be compared. The curves are constructed b~· plotting, at the proper depth, the a>erage >elocity as gfrcn by the observations at that depth. The zero of each curve is the position of the station on the line. The observatious were taken only to 130 fathoms, and below that depth to zero the line is prolonged in the same direction. This continued line is drawn straight, but probably it should be a curve gradually approaching the vertical as the velocity approaches zero. No. 1 station is undouutedly outside the limit of the Stream, but for the time of the observations a slight easterly flow is indicated above 60 fathoms, and to the westward below that depth to about 150 fathoms. No. 2 station is near the edge of the Stream, but tlte i11terforenceof the tides makes the \Tertical cur\Te, as shown, slightly in error, and probably tbe average depth of the true current is not much if any below 100 fathoms. All the other stations are within the limits of ti.Jc Stream, and Nu. 4, wltich is next to the southward of the axis, extends to the greatest depth. The observations at thfr; station were taken a.t the highest declination, and it is probable, therefore, that the average zeru current will be found at a less depth than shown. The dotted line joining the zero points of the vertical cunTes on Illustration No. 39 shows the form of the current prism as oliserved, and it will be at once remarked that there is a certain symmetry in the two halves of the cnrve. A similar line drawn through the zeros of the vertical curves of section DD passes through nearly a constant depth (about 300 fathoms) which is very mu!.!h less than the greatest depth at section CU. It is a remarkable coincidence, however, that the areas inclosed in the two dotted lines are almost exactly the same, the proportion being 100to103. In both sections the channel is more than sufficient to carry the water. At CO the bottom or sides do not interfere with the Stream . .At DD the bottom does interfere slightly on the Yucatan side of the channel. Section CU has the larger area of prism of the two. ·
II.-CROSS-SECTION

1. General character·istics and limit of the Stream.

The profile of the bottom at this section is quite unlike that of section CC, but resembles sec· tion A, with the exception of its depth. To the eastward, the island of Uuba rises precipitously from considerable depth. The western sille is bordered by the Yucatan Bank, which has a depth of 100 fathoms 20 miles from the shore. From this point tlte slope is gradual at first, but the inclination increases rapidly between 500 and 1,000 fathoms. Station No. 1 (see Illustration No. 40) was on the Yucatan Eank in 23 fathoms of water, 15 miles from Contoy Islaull aml about 5 miles from the 100-fathom curve. The current here was partly tidal and partly Gulf Stream, the flood tide combining with the Gulf Stream cur. rent, causing the former to run eighteen hours. The dirf'ction of the e~b was about east, and at the turn, the direction changed to north west by the way of north. The eurrent at 15 fathoms was quite irregular, as if affected by the bottom causing it to eddy and swirl. That this was the case was, on one occasion, shown conC'lusively. At 7.49. a. rn., March 25, the direction of the current at 15 fathoms was SW. Observ!l.tions were taken for direction in quick succession with the following result:

At the distance of this station inside the 100-fathom curve (5 miles), probably at the time of great.est declination of the mQoJI, the Stre~Ql current entirely overcomes tlle tidal current, but as B. Ex.17-12

178

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

the water becomes shoaler and more removed from the Stream, the tides predominate. The true limit of the Stream is probably near the 100-fathom curve, and this limit does not vary to any great amount. The other stations do not need particular mention until we reach Station No. 6, the easternmost of the section. The first anchorage at the station was at a low declination of the moon, and the surface current set northeasterly most of the time. The next anchorage at the station (No. (}a) was at high soutlJern declination, and a southeasterly current was found on the surface, and au east or southeast below. The normal flow below the surface was in each case from the Gulf of :Mexico into the CariblJean, aml the fact that this eddy extended to the surface with lligh declination leads to the belief that this st,ation is situated ontsitfo the average limit of the Stream, that the stronger the Stream itself the more the "volume of the eddy, and that with a weak Stream the less marked is the eddy. At tltis time the Stream is spread out to the eastward and flows northeasterly into the Straits of Florida. Anchored on the bank off Cape San Antonio (which is very narrow), t_he current was found to follow the tides, the flood settiug- to the northward and the ebb to the southward; so that between the eastern limit of the Stream and Cuba we have the eddy or southeast current and the ebb aud flood currents mutually interfering with each other ami with the Stream. The eastern limit of the Stream is to be placed at an average of about 20 miles west of Cape San Antonio, with a probable zone of variable flow for some distanc& on either side of this. 2. Daily variation. The time of tlie daily variation is as marked at this section as elsewhere, but the variation in velocity is more excessive than before experienced. At one time it increased in frrn hours nearly 3 knots, all(l in the next nine hours decreased again; at another time in three hours it increased 3! knots. The avera~e of all the maximum velocities gives, as the "establishment" of the Stream at this section, lOh before and 2i. 2om at'ter the moon's transit. In these results, the number of the maxima from which the a>erages were obtained were equal, but on the other sections the numlJer of the maximum velocities arriving before the transit far exceeded those arriving after it. The lunar an<l solar attractions (to which causes the daily variations are probably for the most part due) are of unequal periods. The tides are at some places reguJar in height and in times, and at others irregular. It is possible that in the same way the daily variations may be modified in character, from local or other causes, so that the time of tl1e arriYal of tlie maximum may be always before the upper transit at some places, as at Section A, and at others, as at Section DD, the maximum for half tho lunar month will arrive before the upper transit, and the other half before the. lower transit. The excessive n1riatio11s were, like those at Section A, on the west side of the Stream. They were accompanied by tide rips and were in shoal water, also points of resemblance. These question!\ will be touched upon later in this report. · 3. The axis of the Stream. The curves showing the horizontal flow of the different strata will be found on Illustration 38, Fig. 3. These curves arc from the actual means at the different stations, except at Stations No. 1 and No. 6, where the north and south components only were used and the algebraic diftereuces plotted. The axis of volume is west of the middle of the Stream, and the axis of surface velocity still farther to the westward. Stations 2, 2t, and 2J! were successively occupied at near the time of the greatest declination of the moon, in order to determine the exact point of the axis, and the curves show the effect of the increased volume by a remarkable increase in velocity, amounting in oue instance to over 3 knots per hour. This increase was accompanied by decided tide rips, as if caused by the interference of the bottom as the current spread out. The maximum velooity is t-0 be 11laced at about 5 miles distant from the 100-fathom curve of Yucatan Bank. 4. The de1lth of the Stream and the velocity at different depths. . Illustration No. 3!.l shows the profile of the Stream at this section. and the vertical eurves placetl at their proper positions, but revolved 90 degrees from the direction of the flow, the same as those of section CC. No. 1 station is situated on the Yucatan Bank. The algebraic sum of the north and south components is plotted and the line is prolonged to zero velocity from the lowest point observed (15 fathoms), and it reaches this zero at or near the bottom.

The other curves, continued to zero, refl.ch it at approximately the same depth, 300 fathoms, except at No. 6 station, which is outside the limit of the Stream, and is a combination of Gulf Stream, eddy, and tides. It is noticeable tllat the depth to which the eddy extends is the same at this station as at station 1, section CC, but it is more decided in its character. The approximate volume of Wtlterflowing through the tliree sections ai; observed, is, section A, 95 billion tons per hour; section CO, 103 billion tons, and 1mction DD, 110 billion tons. The evaporation from the Gulf of l\Iexico and the eddy current would account for the excess at section DD. At section CC, in the calculation, the directions have been taken as flowing east, and this, of cour&e, gives too great an amount. The excess would probably be accounted for by this difference and the eddy, and the volume actually flowing east be equal to t'!lat found at section A.
THE MON'l'HLY VARIATION.

The observations at section A in 1885 and 1886 indicated that there was a monthly variation in the velocity of the Stream, the maximum being shortly after the greatest declination of the moon. The observations wllich by their continuity could be used in drawing a conclusion on this point were mostly taken at southern di·clination. In 1885 only a few hours' observations were made with the moon north of the equator, but these indicated a maximum following the same law as when it was south. In 1886 all the observations obtained with a northern moon gave a similar curve, but with much lower velocity, fro:n which I :stated in my report that it was possible that the lower velocities, with northern declinaiion, might be normal, but the observations were not 1mfficiently numerous to determine the fact. I regret that I am obliged to state that I can not definitely conclude as to the exact law, even now, after another year's observations. At section CC, on April 28, with the moon jnst reaching its greatest northern declination, I found at station 3 a surface current of less than 1 knot per hour, where I had found, with a declination of 70 south, over 3 knots. This seemed to indicato that tlrn "Velocity following the north declination was less than with the moon south, or else that other factors entered the problem, causing an irregularity. I ha<l fouud, at section .A., the }Jrevious year, the same irregularity (low velocity with the moon north); but I attributed it to abnormal influences, barometer, and wind. vVlieu, on this ,Year, I found the irregularity, I determined at once to go to section A and observe its currents. I was, unfortunately, able to remain at the anchorage but twelve hours, on account of bad weather; but I found an average surface current, during that time, of 3.7 knots, and that, too, at the time of the lesser daily maximum. This average is over 1 knot greater than I found in 1886, with the same declination, and not rnore than one-fourth of a knot less than that found with corresponding south declination. At section DD a maximum of 6.2 knots was found after south declination, and about 3.5 knots at the same station with 90 of northern declination. Oft' Cape Hatteras, at station 3, the velocity reached 4.36 knots two days after the greatest northern declination of the moon. It is probable that the regular variations change somewhat in time and velocity with the changes in the relative po&itions of the sun, moon, and earth, with the barometer, thermometer, rain, or wind, or, in other words, by anything which will affect the volume of tbe 6tream. The conclusions of last year regarding this variation seemed to be confirmed, except in the observations described at section CC. This section is at the gateway to the Straits of Florida, and is probably liable to more anomalies than at stations where the Stream is more defined. The actual increase in volume due to the monthly variation i:s probably small; but it is intensified in velocity by local causes (shoal water, etc.). At section CO the local causes do not appear to exist, and the monthly variation is not prominent. There is a possibility, too, that the direction of the flow of the Stream, with reference to the position of the sun and moon, may have some effect on the volume or velocit.r, and the Stream at this section, flowing east, may be accelerated at different parts by differing conditions. We ean only sa,y, at this time, that there is a monthly variation, and that appa.rently the time of the maximum flow is shortly after the moon's highest declination. A comparison of the vertical and other curves of the sections .A, CC, and DD will be of interest. It will be noticed that at section A, where the currents are uninfluenced by the bottom, the zetd points of the vertical curves are at 300 to 350 fathoms depth. This is the case at stations 2, 3, and 4. At stations No. 1 &nd 1~ the current reaches the 'b-Ottom at the moon's highest

180

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

declination, and at station 5 it probably does the same at all times, by direct impingement from the inertia of the mass of water in going around the curve of the Straits of Florida. At section DD the zero points of the curves are at about the same depth (300 fathoms). The current at sta· tion No. 1 probably touches the bottom at the time of the maximum flow; but the average depth of the zero is the same as at the deeper stations. The bottom shoals gradually at the western anchorages at both sections, from considerable depths, and when the current interferes with the bottom, an exaggerated surface flow is rJ:ind. . Section CC, on the other hand, is entirely unlike either of the others in these respects. It flows over no shoal, and consequently the normal daily or monthly increase in volume has nothing to. interfere with its spreadin~ to the northward but its own water walls, and to the southward, the interference of the coast of Cuba is probably but little; the increase in velocity is therefore comparatively small. The vertical curves, it will be seen, are wholly different from the other statfons, the zero line changing its depth continually, and the deepest current and the maxim.um surface velocity are coincident. On Illustration No. 38, Fig. 2, I have drawn the curves of mean horizontal flow, by taking the means at each station of the average currents at each depth observed. In order to compare them wit.h ea-0h other, I i.ncreased the length of the line representing t.he width of the Stream at sections A and CC Ro as to correspond to the width at DD, and reduced the velocities (the abscissre) by a like amount. It will 'be seen that, throwing out the portion of the curve of section DD, the excessive velocity of which is due to the shoal water of Yucatan Bank, the curve of section A is almost identical with it, the velocities, as well as the position of the axis of volume, coinciding most remarkably. Section A has also an increase of surface velocity exactly similar to that of section DD, as will be seen by referring to last year's report. The increase, however, was small in comparison with the latter section, and as it was only on the surface, it does not show in the mean. The mean curve of section CO is entirely different, the maximum being situated near the center of the current prism. To recapitulate the points of similarity and dissimilarity in the three sections: Sections .A. and DD are alike in the following: I. The depth at which the current reaches a zero velocity, where it is not influenced by shoals. II. General contour of bottom, steep-to on eastern side and shoal on western. III. Greatest mean velocity of the flow of the strata above 130 fathoms situated at the same relative distance west of the midclle of the Stream. IV. Axis of velocity situated on the slope of the Bank on west-ern side of the Stream. V. Greatly increased velocity at the axis following the highest southern declination of the moon. VI. Direction of the flow always about north. Section A is not like DD in the following: I. The current touches the Bank to the eastward. II. Under the supposition that the Gulf Stream flows, as a stream of great.er or less magnitude, through the Caribbean Sea in a westerly direction, and changes its course to the northward somewhere not far south of section DD, looking in the direction of the fl.ow, the axis of volume, and also the axis of surface velocity, are on the convex side of the curve, while at section A they are on the concave side. Section CC is similar to both the other sections only in the contour of the bottom-that is, the slope is gra<lual on the left of the Stream, looking in the direction of its flow, but the Strea.m does not reach thi,,. slope. Section CC is like section DD in the area of the current prism. It is unlike the other sections in the following: I. The depth at which the current reaches zero velocity is not the same a.t any station. II. The axis of volume coincides very closely with the axis of velocity and both are at or . near the middle of thfl current prism. TIT. No large increase in velocity depending upon the declination of the moon. IV. General direction of the flow east, but variable in direction, at diiferent parts the section, the general movement being inclined toward the axis.

Without a doubt the whole Stream in all its variations ob<:1ys as fixed and regular laws as those which govern any other natural phenomenon. In an investigation of this kind, where so many factors enter to cause anomalies, without simultaneous observations at different places, not only of the results as shown in the water of the Gulf Stream, but of the causes which go to forlll the resultant, it is very difficult to reconcile everything and ascribe a cause for a certain result. We recognize the fact of the existence of the Stream; we surmise that certain things cause the flow; we see that it has regular variations obeying some Jaw of nature, but there are exceptions to the law, and to discover the cause of the exceptions and so establish definitely the law; is made ver,r difficult without a complete study of all the data available. The current at section .A impinges on the Eastern Bank at all times, but its velocity is not excessive, and the increase at high declination is only about one-half knot. The question which naturally arises is, if the current in touching the shoal to the westwar<l increases its velocity, why does not the same occur 011 the Bahama side of the channel T This is on the convex side of the circle and at or near the end of the cune of the Straits of Florida. The Stream has been flowing east and has just turned to the north before reaching the isection~ and b)' the inertia impinges on the East Bank. This side is comparatively steep-to; but throwing out any influence other than that which causes the water to flow, it should increase its velocity where it slloals its depth. In actual fact the velocity here is less than at other parts of tile Stream, but the current is deeper· .At section DD the water, by its inertia, presses against the Yucatan Bank, and an increaseu current is caused, whicli is abnormally increased at the time of the monthly maximum . .At section .A the maximum was 5 25 knots per hour, and at section DD 6.25 knots. The first was the monthly maximum, without the effect of inertia, and the last the monthly maximum combined with the inertia of the Stream. On a straight stream of water, with equally smooth inclosing hanks and uniufiueuced b,r outside forces other than those causing the flow, the axis of velocity antl Yolume should be in the michlle of the Stream. At section CC the current prism is south of the middle of the straits and the axis is near the center of the current prism. At the axis the current extends deeper than anywhere else, aml while the flow is east it inclines toward the axh1 on either side. At the other sections tlle flow is, approximately, north at all parts; the axis is west of the center of the Stream and of the straits, and at tlie same time on opposite sides of the Stream with reference to the inertia of the incoming water. All these pheuomona, l can but conclude, are chiefly due to the rotative action of the earth. The direction of the flow at section CC is east, and the rotatirn action rctardis tlie velocity but deepens the current, and the inertia carries this deep current to the Bahama side of the Stream iu rounding the bend, but the rotative action throws the axis west of the middle. In the Oaribbeau Sea the rotation is contrary to the motion of the Stream. The inertia and rotation combine to cause the maximum velocity of the current at section DD to be on the west side of the Stream and to be greater than at section A, or, in other words, at the latter, the velocity of the axis is effected by the rotation minus the inertia aud at tl.te former by rotatien plus inertia. The course traveled by the current-bottles set afloat in the Stream when we were at anchor may have some bearing on the subject. Of the bottles thrown overboard west of the axis at section A, 50 per cent. have been found on the coast of Florida within 150 miles of the point of starting, and not a. single bottle set afloat in the Stream east of the axis has ~en heard from. It would appear as if some force other than wind and current was at work. Lieutenant Maurs's idea of the elevation of tbe middle of the Stream I think receives support from the bnttles, if we substitute axis for miiltlle. If the theory is true, everything floating m the current would gradually a.pproa.cb. the edges of the Stream. Those west of the axis could hardly escape our shores, but those east of the axis would go into the broad Atlantic and probably would never he heard from. If the Stream is elevated at the axis, as seems 1>robable, the rotative effect would be greatet on. t.his axis than on the less elevated portions, and would move it west of the center. The tempera-

This would point to a greater elevation, and although it is slight in amount, it probably has its effect on the position of the maximum tlow.

Two anchorages were made at this section (southeast from Cape Hatteras) and the results are particularly interesting. The first anchorage was in a depth of 1,852 fathoms, with a surface current varying between 3.16 knots aml 4.36 knots. The rubber springs in the accumulator, some of which were three seasons old, commenced to sp1it by the great strain upon them, and I was obliged to get under way for threatening weather, after but eight hours' observations. At the second anchorage, in about 300 fathoms, I rnrnained fifty-eight hours and carried the observations for a part of the time down to a depth of 200 fathoms. Illustration No. 41 shows the curves of both anchorages. The data are not sufficient to enable us to detl'lrmine the establishment of the Stream at this point, lmt the curves indicate the same kind of fluctuations as at the other sections. The existence, too, of over a 4 knot current ou the second day after the highest declination of the ·moon confirms the opinion that the monthly variation does not cease in the Gulf Stream with its departure from the 8traits of Florida. The most interesting feature in the observations off Hatteras is the discovery by direct evidence of the existence of tidal action aud the polar counter-current underneath the Gulf-Stream water. Referring to the arrows representing the directious of the currents, it will be seen that at station No. I, at :!00 fathoms depth, the current alternates its direction with regularity. Dividiug up the hours of obserrntion into periods according to the direction of the flow north and south, we ha Ye the following average directions and inter\·als.

m. = 7 · hours. m. = 5t hours. m.=6 hours. m. = 5t hours. m. =:7t hours.

This gives au average current flowing about SSE. i ~·nearly seven hours, and NNW. i W. a little more than five hours. Carrying the same proportion back to the time of the observations taken at station 3, to dis· cover if the tidal action influenced the direction at 130 fathoms, we find that, for over five hours, during which observations were taken at that depth, the mean direction should be northerly. It was, in fact, N. ~ E., showing that probably if observations had been taken 50 fathoms deeper, the same tidal action would have been found. One hundred and thirty fathoms was so near the uividing line between the Gulf-Stream current and the tidal current that they mutually interfered with each other, resulting in a direction between the two. The unequal duration of the ebb and fiood shows the probable existence of a subcurrent coming from the Arctic. This current, lengthening or shortening the two tides less than an hour, seems but a slight current, but if the whole mass of water is affected below the depth at which it is observed, it amounts, in the aggregate, to an immense volume flowing to the southward. It is probable, too, that at this depth the influence of' the Stream is felt .at times, and the average diroo· tions (NNW. ~ W. and SSE.~ E.) are not the same as would be found at a lower depth. The following is a summary of the conclusions arrived a.t from a hurried study of the salient points of the observations: The Gulf Stream is found flowing about north into the Gulf of Mexico through the western part of the Straits of Yucatan; is found again ftowi11g east in the southern part of the Straits of

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Florida, south of Rebecca Shoal, and north again through the narrowest part of the Straits of :Florida, east of Fowey Rocks, but now occupying the whole of the passage. 'l'he axis of volume of the Stream, in its northerly courses, is west of the middle of the current prism, and the axis of surface velocity is still farther west. When it flows east, the axes of volume and of surface velocity coincide very nearly with the middle of the Stream. The depth to which the current flows is about 3CO fathoms iu the northerly courses, whe11 not affected by the depth of water or outside influences. When it flows east it extends to a much greater depth (at the axis off Rebecca Shoal to uOO or 700 fathoms). The deep current, at the axis of \'olume and velocity, in the Stream, when flowing east, appears afterwards at section A as a deep current of less velocity flowing north, but it is on the extreme eastern side of the Stream. The high surface velocity does. not accompany it, but is found farther west. The position of the axis of volume of the Stream, at the sections where it is flowing north, is found at relatively the same distance west of tlrn middle. The maximum temperature follows very closely the maximum velocity, whether fiowiug east or north. A daily variation exists in all parts of the Stream. At Fowes Rucks the maximum flow is 9h 09m before the transit of the moon, at Rebecca Shoal 91> 20m, and at the Straits of Yucatan lOh oow before the transit This variation is most excessive where the Stream flows with a northerly course over, or extends to, shoal water (from 100 to 300 fathoms). A monthly variation exists, the maximum arriving two or three days after the moon's greatest declination, and is more excessive when the Stream flows over shoal water. Between Rebecca Shoai and TortugaR tlie current is tidal, flowing about north with the flood and south with the ebb. Five miles west of Loggerhead Key, Tortugas, tidal action was found, but the southerly (the ebb) set predominated. South of Rebecca Shoal Light-house, the average edge of the Stream is about 30 wiles di:.;taut. Between this limit and the Light-house the direction of the current varies, the tidal action being felt near the latter and the easterly current toward the former. In the Stream, south of Rebecca Shoal, the set of the current is inc1ined toward the axis; the nearer the edges the more the divergence from east. Between Cuba and Yucatan, the eastern limit of the Stream is about 20 miles distant from Cape San Antonio. In the western part of this space of 20 miles an edd;y cnrreut exists, probably flowing about SE. at high declination of the moon and NE. at low declination. In the eastern pa.rt, near the cape, the current is tidal, flowing north with the flood and south with the ebb. On the Yucatan Bank at this section the current is tidal, but the nearer the edge of tlrn Bank the more the tidal action is overcome by tlte overflow from the Gulf Stream. The greatest velocity of the Stream is found on the edge of the Bank in from 200 to 300 fathoms depth · Off Cape Hatteras, tidal action is found at 200 fathoms clepth underneath the Gulf Stream, the set being to the northward and westward five hours, and to the southward and eastward seven hours. The difference in time is probably accounted for by a polar subcurrent 1iartly overcoming the tidal wave. The deep current at the axis where the Stream flows east; the position of the axis at relatively the same distance west of the mid<lle of the Stream at both sections, wliere it is flowing north, although with opposite conditions as regards the inertia of the incoming water; the direction of the current at all parts of the Stream, about parallel with the flow at the axis, when north, and inclined toward the axis when east; and last, the highest temperature accompanying the highest velocity, all point to the influence of the rotation of the earth on this vast body of moving water. The sketch (Illustration No. 34) showing the project of the lines for the development of tlie Gulf-Stream current in the accompanying report is slightly different from that which I originally submitted. The line marked :EE has been inserted for this reason: The currents at section DD flow north, except at station 6, where at times during the month they haye been found setting SE, and NE., with a subcurrent setting SE. at all times. At section CO, north of the axis, the set is SE., and south of the axis NE. The route by which the water travels from the first section to the last mentioned is in doubt, and I think the section EE wiH solve the question.

UNITED ST.A.TES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The sections drawn between the islands of the West Indies are for the purpose of ascertaining the relation between the times and velocities of the current entering the Caribbean and passing int-0 the Gulf of Mexico. Reasoning upon temperatures and depths found in these passages and in the Gulf of Mexico, it has been stated that the water entering the latter comes through the Windward and Mona Island Passages. Many of the principal islands are separated by depths through which most of the water flowing out of the Straits of Florida could pass. We have investigated currents :flowing north at two sections and one flowing east. The only place where opposite conditions can be found (and within the province of the Coast Survey to investigate), that is, where the Stream is flowing west, or contrary to the direction of the earth's rotation, is in the passages between the 'Windward Islands. On the observations 11ow completed, the conclusion would be arrived a,t that in all ocean currents flowing north the axis is west of the middle and the current extends to about a constant depth. \Vhen flowing east the axis coincides with the middle of the current, and the flow is deepest at that point. 'l'o ascertain the characteristics of the current :flowing west will be of the greatest importance to science as well as commerce, and will enable us to define the fixed laws gcwerning the currents of the world with a degree of certainty which, without these data, would be very incomplete. I beg to call your attention to the record as attesting to the faithful labors of the officers and crew belonging to the party. The following is the list of officers: Ensign R. M. Hughes, executive officer and navigator; Ensigns A. G. Rogers, W. J. Sears, F. Swift, and I. K. Seymour, observers; Passed Assistant Engineer. George W. Cowie, jr.; Passed Assistant Surgeon W. H.

Method of observing.-It was the same as that used heretofore and described in C'oast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1880, Appendix: No.11, pp.1.'37? 138, with this important exception, however, that the simultaneous double liue with reversal of direction for alternate sections was giveu up for.the method of securing two independent measures by running a single line (say) forward, followed by a single line running backward. Convenient distances along tho line were selected and run, after which the direction of the measure was reversed, which reversal took place generally either about the middle of the same day, or, preferably, 011 different days, according to circumstances. Thus the conditions of the instrument antl of the atmosphere, as well as of the observer, were different for the two measures, which was not the case when simultaneous double lines were run. The lines of sight forward and backward were nearly equal in length. Statistical information.-Number of permanent bench-marks on the line, 29; total development of line from bench-mark A, at MolJile, to bench-mark I, at Carrollton (New Orleans), !:33 kilometers, or 145 statute miles. The distance of the target or staff from the instrument was very nearly 100 meters (on the average, 10! meters, omitting exceptional lines). Coniputations.-The observer furnished a field computation; the Office and cheek compu tat1on was made by Assistant E. Smith, while attached to the Computing Division, between January 11 and April 4, 18~7. The small difference of reading of screw between the pointings for horizon and for target gives rise to the correction of staff reading d = D tan a, where D = di1'tance of instrument to target as measured by the telemeter-lines, and expressed in meters, and a the angular difference of horizon and target, and expressed in seconds of arc. The table constructed for this correction serves likewise for the correction due to inequality of co11ars. TlH·
correction for curvature and r(Jfraction is given by h =
6

of curvature, or 6.371 x 10 meters, and m = index correction is applied where needed, also the correction dne to the expansion or eontrnc· tion of the brass scales of the staves for temperatures differing from that at which they are of standard length. Range of temperature during measure, lJet,ween 250 Fahrenheit and 970 Fahrenheit. Results.-They are drawn up in tabular form for ready reference. Table I contains the in<lid<lual result:> and the necessary data to enable one to judge of the accuracy of the measures; Table II shows the resulting heights and probable uncertainties· of the principal bench-marks between Biloxi and Carrollton above the average Gulf-level, and a comparison of the results from the two levelings, i. e., that by the Mississippi River Commission and that by the Coast aml Geo<letic Survey; Table III exhibits the resulting heights and probable uncertainties for the line Biloxi to Mobile.
·Probable uncertainty is used here in the sense of probable error.

Aocuracy of the results of the line of levels. The determination of the iwobable errors of the resulting differences of height of the marks at Mobile and at Carrollton au<l of their absolute heights is based upon the ob~<>erved differences of heights of the intermediate mr-trks resulting from the forward antl backward measures. The probable error of the result of spirit-leveling of precision developed in a distance of one kilometer has generally been adopted as a convenient measure for comparison of accuracy of various lines. In accordance with the method of least sq_uares as applied to spirit·leveling we take the probable error of leveling to be proportional to vi; or, what comes to the same tliing, the weight u' of a result is inversely proportional to the lengths, or U'= .

We have also rn,= ±1.40mm, a quantity which may be advantageously used for comparisons. The values for r 11 indicate a measure of great precision and the two instruments give sensibly the same value, No. 3 having been used on the line from bench-mark P 1 to I where r 11 = :l:O.®mm. It is a general experience that the probable error r, so obtained, proves too small as shown by the discrepancies appearing at crossings and from interlacing lines of levels. This arises from the fact that in the latter case errors, known as constant or systematic errors, make themselves felt. Their presence is directly attested by the so-called accumulation error, which is found more or less <level· oped in lines leveled in opposite (or twice in the same) direction, but which it is altogether beyond the skill of the observer, the perfections of his instrument, and the method of observing to remove entirely so as to make the successive differences appear fortuitous. On our line, starting from Mobile, the results for the successive marks from the forward and backward measures begiu to diverge, reaching from zero, December 7, to 38 millimeters on December 28, which represents the maximum divergence; after this the two results rapidly converge to accord and between the middle of .January and the close of the operation on April 12 the cumu· lative error had practically disappear ed. On the same line of levels between Biloxi and Carrollton, the results by the Mississippi River Commission (see Annual Report for 1883, p. 148) reached a divergence at the ~rnl of the line at Carrollton of 50 millimeters; not, however, until after about 60 kilometers had been run did the results begin to deviate. In the same volume, page 70,t we have the assigned probable error of the leveling operation of 1882-'83 between Bilox:i and Carrollton, viz, 8.0 millimeters, a result almost identical with our result 7.3 millimeters as given above, showing that both operations were conducted with great accuracy.

Disturbing influence of differential attraction of the sun and moon on the direction of gravity and its effect on spirit-leveling.
It is proposed to inquire into the magnitude of the deflection of the vertical depending on the variable positions of either the sun or the moon with respect to the direction of a line of levels and to estimate the effect on the resulting heights. It may be shown that for any place on the earth's surface the disturbance of gravity in direction and intensity by the action of the sun and moon, as depending on the momentary position of eitht·r l11111i11ary and as measured by the diffnence of effect on the earth's center and on the point at its l'lll'fael', is so small that ordinarily it can be entirely omitted in the astronomical determination or geng-raphical positions. If, according to Helmert, to whom the investigation is due,j 1\1 = muss of the sun or the moon, Mo= mass of the earth, p =horizontal parallax of the luminary, r =its zenith distance, and P =the disturbing effect, expressed in seconds;
*By the second or simple formula we have for r,, the values ±O.G&nm, ±o.74mm, and ::f::0.60mm for the three line respectively. (See table above.) tOn page 53, Assistant Engineer J. B. Johnson gives for the entire line the probable error± 7wm and on the average ::!: o.oomm per kilometer. t Matheruatic:al and physical theories of Higher GOOdesy, by Dr. F. R.

and the westerly deviation

where A= aL<imuth of luminary, counted as usual from the south around by west. Introducing numerical values we have for the moon P = 0" .017 4 and for the sun P = 0" .0080. These being maximum values, the infl11ence of either body on the direction of the pl nm b-line is practically a vanishing quantity. The disturbance of the intensity of gravity is likewise insensible; with the latter, however, we are not here concerned. In consequence of the disturbed direction of gravity, the position of the level-surface passing through the point will be changed, heuce also the result of spirit-leveling will \.Jecome affected since that operation refers everywhere to the actual level-surface during measure. If the leveling is conducted "forward" in the south westerly azimuth a, the direction of sight "fo:rward" will be depressed iu consequence of the disturbetl vertical by the angle

and the correction for the staff-reading "forward," will be+; y, and for "backward," - ~ y, hence the differenee of staif-readings "back ward-forward,'' or the correction t.o difference of height will be

where s = tlie distance between the two positions of the staff. Here P is to be expressed in arc, viz: for the moon noo 0 0 0 0 and for the sun 23 - 0-.f-0-000 · Thus for any one instrumental station the effect is altogether insensible, but it may become sensible l>y accumulation in extern.led lines of levels. If we next suppose the moon and the sun to be in the equator, or h;i,ve zero declination, and the leveling to be done in the northern hemisphere, it will be noticed that, in the above expression (2), Cin the first quadrant will be accompanied by A in the first or fourth quadrant, arnl .:;- iu the second quadrant will be accompanied by A in the second or third quadrant; hence in leveling t'roill north to south, or for a= O, the expression (2) will always be positive, whereas fo1· the case of an east and west line (a= 900) a change of sign may take place, and consequently, to some extent, compensation will diminish the effect under consideration. The circumstance that the luminaries assume different declinations does not in the maiu alter the general effect. For levelings proceeding in a north and south direction there will consequently remain some average effect on resulting difference of height and of about the same amount (in particular if the operation bas extende<l over the space of a. lunation) for every repetition of the measure, since the direction of the measure is here immaterial. For an east and west line, on the contrary, the lunar effect may be nearly elifl\inated and the solar effect considerably reduced. Lines of intermediate azimuths partake of the character of ea.ch of the two cardinal directions. We may fairly estimate the actual cftect on a leveling to he not more than two.thirds of the maximum effect, and generally it will be less than one-half of it and thus practically eludes recognition. Let us take the case of a. line of levels along a meridional arc of 1° in length, then foi· the moon the maximum disturbing or aecamulated effect producible will be 0.009 meter in height and the probable a.ctual ettoot 4 or 5 millimeters or less than this amount. In case of the sun being

198

the disturbing body the effect woulcl be about half of that produced by the moon. These effects merge themselves with the probable errors of the measure. Dr. Helmert cites the interesting bypothetieal case of a maximum difference of levels from a repeated measure, viz, an east and west line 1000 kilometer8 in length, measured in the summer months in the forenoon always westerly, and during the second measure in the afternoou always easterly; then the results of the two levelings may differ in consequence of the differential solar attraction by as much as 8.7 centimeters (about 3:r inches), although the mean result will not be affected. In practice no special attention is paid to the position of the 111miI1aries (except that the sun be above the horizon), nor is the direction of the measure in any way regulated (as was assumed in the abo\'e hypothetica,l case) for east and west lines with respect to rooming and afternoon hours of work; thus more or less compensation is permitted to take place. Tile above considerations sufficiently demonstmte that perha1Js for all practical levelings the lunar and solar influence, as a disturbing force on the vertical, is of too minute an order to demand special attention and that the effect in the present Rtate of the art of leveling is entirely concealed in the probable uncertainties of the measure itself. There are two other effects which in:fiuence the results from spirit-leveling, viz, the effect of the spheroidal figure of the earth and the effect due to local deflections of the vertical; the former depending on the convergence of level surfaces toward the pole, the latter depending on the slopes or hypsometry of the surface and the variations in gravity. As neither circumstanee has auy application to the Mobile (New Orleans) line I shall here pass by their special consideration.

Connection with the Gulf level.
The line of spirit-levels is referred to the a·erage level of the Gulf of Mexico by means of tidal observations made by direction· of the Mississippi River Commission at Biloxi, Miss., between September, 1881, and March, 18S!.t Before entering upon tlle detail of the determination of this zero level it will be pertinent to offer a few remarks upon the tides of Mississippi Sound. The peculiar character of the tides of Mississippi Sound, which connects quite freely with the waters of the Gulf, was early recognized and investigated by the Coast Survey. Hourly observations were made during 1848 and 184.() at Oat Jslaud under the dirrction of Superintendent Bache, ~hose discuc>sions of these tides will be found in Coast Survey Report for 1851, Appendix No. 71 anft in Report for 1852, Appendix No. 22. These tides had previously been regarded by navigators as too irregular for analysis and prediction. It was then seen that these fluctuations belonged to the class of single-day tides, but with a remarkably small range, the average rise and fall being less than a foot and a half. In later years, after tlte harmonic analysis of the tides had been developed, the committee on tides appointed by the British Association for the Admncement of Science applied for the Cat Island record, comprising about thirteen months, in order to test tbe application of the harmonic analysis for the e\'aluation of the components of the tides at this place. The results are contained in the report of the committee made in 1872 and in the volume for the South· port meeting in 1883.t The lunar-diurnal component and the luni-solar diurnal component have each a semi-range of about half a foot; the lunar and solar semi-diurnal tides only reach about one-tenth of a foot, and there are indieations of meteorological influences depending on daily and annual periods. The solar annual tide has apparently a semi-range of nearly one-third of a foot and the solar semiaunual about half this amount. In June, 1887, inquiry was made for the automatic tidal record at Biloxi, whicp was found to have been deposited in the archives of the Surve:y§ for safe-keeping; it was placed without delay in the hands of the Tidal Division of the Office with directions to work
·Supposed.

t Prom August., 1881, to January, 1883, the observer was W. H. Price.
i See also Proceedings of the Royal Society, Vol. XXXIX, London, 1886, pp.135-207. §There is no explanation accompanyilig the rolls, aud the precise Iocatiou of the gange and staff is unknown. (Iu a letter dated July 2d, ltl&7, Mr. Weir says the ga.uge was on piles near the draw· bridge.) The gauge, there i8 reason to believe, had been ma.de at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Oflioe.

ont the reading of the average or half-tide sea level, separately for each lunation and for general discussion, as time would permit. Mr. A. S. Christie, Chief of the Tidal Division, reports the following results under date of June 27, 1887, and remarks: "The original record of the observations " " " extends from September 5~ 1881, to March 1, 1884', and is rather unsatisfactory both as regards time notes and staff-readings. On this account no use has been made of the series during 1883 and 1884, and the part used-only that extending from June to December-depends upon actual staff-re.adings. From September, 1881, to June, 1882, the observer entered upon the rolls what he called staff. readings, but there are reasons for supposing that they were readings of a scale fixed over the gauge roller and presumed to coincide in its readings with those of the staff."

No farther discussion of the Biloxi tides was sent in at this time. To obtain from these results the mean staff-reading of the sea. level we find for the period, June, 1882, and November, 1882, from seven lunations, during which the relation of the gauge to the staff was satisfactory, the value 6.26 feet, whereas the mean from sixteen lunations gives 6.24; this indicates that we may use the whole series for our purpose. It is evident from the run of the tabular values that .itey are subject to an annual inequality, whether due to the tides directly or to meteorological causes, indirectly, will be immaterial for the combination. It is quite certain that the Gulf level is affected by prevailing winds and variatioDR in atrnmipheric presimre, in the rain*Hean local time, civil reckoning, but hours counted from 0 to 24.

From this com bi nation it would appear that, iu this particular case, the·Gulf level was highest in the early fall an<l. lowest during winter; the variation was about 0.67, or two-thirds of a foot nearly. For want of other annual means the probable uncertainty of the resulting value, G.23 feet, or l .89d9 meters, can not be assigned. .As an estimate, merely, I offer the value ± 0.025 meter until something better can be had. This rough estimate of uncertainty is more than double the probable error of the whole line of measure and thus indicates the desirability of supplying this information by further tidal observations which nee<l. not necessarily be automatic. To connect our resultR of spirit-levels with the Gulf level we have the following measure recorded in the Annual Reµort of the Mississippi River Commission for 1883, page 70, viz: 8-foot mark of tide-gauge (staff) at Biloxi om.2390 above U. S. P. B. 1\1. No. ~l, which bench mark is identical with our bench-mark F 1· Nothing coul<l. be learned in 1885-'86 of the position of this staff or gauge, hence the above measure is the only means to make the connection 1 though we posses:s rough checks incidentally supplied by Mr. Weir.· The average Gulf level is, therefore, om.5395 - om.2390 = om.3005 below F 1 ; in other words, bench-mark A at Mobile is Sm.7351 anti bench· mark I at Carrollton (New Orleans) 2m.6659 above the average Gulf level.
*On p. 53 of the Annual Re-port Mississippi River Commission for 18.,3, we have the statement: "the zero of the Carrollton gauge will prove to be some 2 or 3 inches above mean tide," and pp. 60-61: elevation of the 14-foot mark of water-gauge at Carrollton tom.640, antl of the Coast Survey bench-mark I, 9m.027 (p. 129); hence differ{lnce tm.613, and the zero of the 11taff would be 2m.66G-2m,(j54=0"'.012 above the Gulf level, which is in ·nfilcient agreement with the statement. The zero of the Carrollton gauge was further determined in 1886, April, viz: 16-foot mark of gauge 2m.2256 above B. M. I, hence the zero of staff Om .015 above the Gulf level, a l'esnlt differing but 3mm from the older measure. According to Mr. Weir we have tbe following measures of the Gulf water level at 4h 17m p. m. on February 1, 1886: At staff east eud of Biloxi bridge, at staff near draw-bddge, and at staffnoar west eu<l, wat.er level 3m_341 below B. }I. 92, tm.;79 below B. M. 93, and lm.189 below B. M. 94, respectively, corresponding to sea level at that time below 1;he average leve1,.scm.9, !)cm,;, and !J<'m. t, respectively. The measures to tide water at Bay St. Louis gave similar though not quite so close checks. ·

THE MAGNETIC WORK OF THE GREELY ARCTIC EXPEDITION.
Abstract ofa Report by CHARLES A. SCHOT'.l!', Assistant.

It is well known that the Expedition sent out by the Government to Iiady Franklin Bay in command of Lient. A. W. Greely, U. S. Army, was one of two expeditions to co-operate with and form part of the physical explorations proposed by the International Polar Commission. By invitation of its president, the late General Hazen, Chief Signal Officer, accepted the organization and fitting out of two p"arties, one under Lieutenant Greely to be sent to the shores of Lady Franklin Bay, Grinnell Land, the other, under Lieut. P. H. Ray, to go to U glaa.mie, Point Barrow, Alaska. While the gennal responsibility, the supervision, the accounts, the selection of men and their tmnsportation to and from the stations, remained in bis own bands, General Hazen requested and received the aid of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the special departments of terrestrial magnetism, of tides and gravitation. The assistance of the Survey by its then Superintendent, Capt. U. P. P<ttterson, consisted in furnishing such instruments as could be spared from its limited supply, in training the observers for their work and in providing them with the necessary instructions and forms of record for the proper performance of their duty. It so happened that Congress had already (in 1880) authorized a scientific expedition to Lady Franklin Bay, but the funds were appropriated so late in the spring ofi881 that it was found impossible to procure the needed special instruments and to give that thorough training to the corps of observers which could only be obtained by ample time for preparation. Indeed the Commission itself found it expedient to start other expeditions a y"ear later in order to obtain a better organization of the scientific labor, and especially for the construction of suitable magnetic differential instruments. There is no need of referring here to the general history of the two American expeditions, as we already have the official publication of the one under Lieutenant Ray, and the narrative of the Lady Franklin Bay party, in two handsome volumes, by its leader, Lieutenant Greely. By his permission we were enabled to lay at an early date before the readers of" Science'' the general result.s of his labors during 181Sl-'84 in the domain of Terrestrial l\lagnetism. They are extracted from the manuscript, now ready for the printer, but it is not our intentiou to enter miuutely iuto any details which would be here out of place, nor to forestall the judgment of scientists on the merits of the work-this must be reserved for a time after the official publication, and when the results by the several international expeditions can be compared and collated. A brief statement of facts, so far as they relate to that part of the work which was intrusted to the special direction of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, is all we propose to give at present. The astronomical and magnetic work of the Expedition was placed in special charge of Ser· geant Eu ward Israel, who unfortunately was une of those not permitted to return, but whose records ab1mdautly testify to his faithfulness and painstaking industry. Copies of these records in a highly condensed form were safely brought home and were placed in the hands of C. A. Schott, Assistant

UNITED STATES COAST AND G EODETIO SURVEY.

U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, for discussion, and for preparation for the press. This task was rendered somewhat difficult from want of sufficient explanation on the part of the observer. Fortunately Lieutenant Greely took the precaution when retreating in 1883 from his station to bring \Tith him the magnets and pendulums, thus permitting certain supplementary ohsen"ations to he made at home. This can not be too highly commended when we consider that every pournlof dead weight carried necessitated lea Ying behind ~o much food to sustain the life of the. party on its perilous retreat. In judging of the merits of the labors of the Rxpedition it should be borne in mind that all efforts had failed to succor this party, which occupied the northernmost station assigned to any of the Expeditions, and that at the time of its sailing certain magnetic instruments, needed for fully carr,ying out the programme adopted by the Intermitional Commission coulLl not be obtained. '£he l\Iagueti0 Obsen·atory at Fort Conger was erected a short distance from the main house and was supplied wilh a new wag 11etometer made by Fauth & Co., of Washington, au<l witb,a dip circle of the Kew pattern, but it had no differential instruments. The obseiTatioul:i were matle on Giittingen mean time, which differs 41i 59"' from local time and 51' 48"' from 'Vasliington timt>. A small transit, loaued by the 8nr~ey, sen·ed for the determinations of time and longitude. Tlie observations for time and latitude were made hy means of the· sextant, and compal'isons of chronometers were made throughout the stay of the party. From a. serie& of obsen·atious of double altitmlns of the sun near (lower transit), and of circum-meridian altitudes of the "llll ( n pper trausit), the Lttitude was found to lle 8l 0 44' 00".4 :±5".4. The azimuth of the mark for ah~mlute <leclimition was determiued ou tliree days from ob>erYations of the sun with the theodolite, viz, 44° 44'.3± 0'.8 east of south. Tlie longitude of the station from Greenwich was determined by meaus of ships' chronometers 011 the outward trip, arnl at the station by ouservations of moon cuhuinatious, occultations, arnl lunar distauces, witll the result 41' 18m 55'.3± 1·.2 W. of Greenwich. The accurac;v of this result is maillly due to a :fiue series of seventeen muo11-cnlrninatio11s. In arc the longitmle is G!O 43' 50" vv., aud the value preliminarily adopted by Lieutenant Greely for his party was HJCJ 45' \Y., on the authority of Lieutenant Archer, R. ~.,as the result by the British Expedition to this place in 1875-'76. During the fir.~t ten months of the occupation of the post a series of hourly observations of the declination were made on three days in each month. This comprises the period from Augrnst 1, 1882, to August 31, 1883, and includes 846 ouservations with a resulting declination 1000 13'.6 weist of north. The results of the diurnal variation of the declination are stated as follows: On the ;\'Carly average the needle reached its extreme westerly deflection between 311 and 41i p. m. (local time), amount 45', aud its extreme easterly detle0tion between 011 and 211 a. m. (local time), amount 40', hencfl the diurnal range io !.l5'. The diurnal variation is illustrated by a diagram. The series of hourly ouserrntions of the declination at Fort Conger began with July 1, 1882, and ended with August 1, 1883; this is the p8riod which was assigned by the International Uommissiou to be that of close and simultaneous co-operative magnetic work obligatory on all parties. The difforential measures of this iserit>s. were conv-erted into absolute values; the tabulation and discussion of this series constituted the greater part of the labor expended on the observatiom;. The method of separating the so-called disturhances from the general record, and their treatment when ::;eparated, was left, apparently, by the Vienna Uonfereuce to the discretion of each individual party, though several methods were proposed. It is well known that there is no certain critcrivu of what constitutes <1 disturbance, and, moreover, processes that may answer in lower lati· tulle::; will be found difficult of application for stations in high magnetic latitudes. It would take too much space to explain here this rather technical subject; it ma.y be :mfficiently described, however, by stating that the mean dm·iation of au observed value from its respective hourly aud monthly normal Yalue was first made out. Then according to Dr. Lloy<l's rule one and a half times this value, or in the caise of Fort Conger 10 06', was considered the limiting value, and any observation differing by this or a greater amount from the normal value was designated " a disturbance." These hourly uornmls and (larger) disturbances were tabulated and the results were di1SCussed. The arnrage declination from this series is 1000 34'.5 west, anrl when compared with the earlier rnsults of the British Expeditiou gives 9'.9 as the most probable \'alue for the annual diminution of west declination at this place. It ii:i shQwn that the effect of the presence of these (larger) disturb·

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

209

ances was to diminish the declination by 2'.3, and that the diurnal range of the motion of the needle was increased by their influence. The solar diurnal variation of the declination is presented in tabular and analytical form as well as by a diagram; its mrnit characteristic feature is the occurrenc,-e of the westerly extreme soon after local noon with a deflection of 37'.9, reached earlier in summer and later in winter; the opposite extreme is reached an hour aud a half after widnight with a deflection of 27'.9, also found variable with the season. Average diurua,l range October to March 0° 56', and April to September io 22'. In the annual variation of this average range, December exhibits the minimum of 2W and June the maximum of 10 48'. The lowest reading on record was on November 16, 1882, at Sh 35m a. m. (Gottingen time), when the declination was !J28 51'.6 ~W., and the higheat reading on the day following at lOh 2om p. m. (Greenwich time), ,·iz, 1138 Hl'.S W., showing a change of no less than 20° 28' .2 within thirty eight honrs, and it is noted that a great magnetic storm was raging between November 13 and November 19, 1882, which culminated in intensity ou the lith. The total number of hourly observations during the year was 8749, and the number of (larger) disturbances separated from them 1169; in other words, there was one (largely) disturbed observation in every eight. The distribution of tlle disturbances in. the diurnal autl annual periods, with separation into easterly antl westerly disturbances; was then airnlyzed and the results were tabulated, both with respect to frequency and magnitude; but for want of space we can not follow out all the results presented. We may, however, mention the following: During the year (ending August 1, 1883) the easterly disturbances exceeded in number the westerly ones in tbe propor· tion of 661to508, or of 1.30 to 1; in the annual variation the disturbing force was most acth·e during November, and least during September. In the diurnal variation the easterly and the westerly disturbances follow different laws as to frequency and amount. The dh>turbing force deflecting tlle north end of the needle towards the (magnetic) east is most active two hours after midnight and least active during hours 12 to 17 (or afternoon hours); ou the other hawl deflections to the west appear most frequent three hours after noon and least about the I.tours near midnight. Respecting intensity of action easterly disturbances slightly exceed westerly ones. The term-day and term-hour observations extend over the interval from July 1, 1882, to August 1, 1883. They were made on the 1st and 15th of each month, when the declination magnet was observed every five minutes throughout the twenty-four hours, simultaneously, at all stations tak· ing part in the research. Besides these, observatious were made eYers twenty seconds during une selected hour on each of the term days. The labor bestowed on this part of the work was very great, but it is expected that correspondingly valuable results may be deduced by their intercomparison after all the expeditions shall have published their observations. Not content with these labors, the magnetic observers also recorded the motion of the needle during magnetic storms and in connection with appearances of auroras. The usual observations of oscillations and deflections were made for the determination of the magnetic intensity; the record and computations are given in detail and the results are tabulated and expressed in British, Gaussian, and C. G. S. units or dynes. For the epoch (1882-'84) the llorizontal component of the magnetic force was found to be 1.118 British units or 0.03155 dyne, and it would appear from comparison with the results found by the British Exploring Expedition, 1875'76, that this intensity did not undergo any perceptible change during the interval. The tabular values show extreme variations of about 5\ part of the force. Hourly observations of the dip were made between September 25, 1882, and June 1, 1883. These were in a measure differential, and resulted in an average dip of 85° 01'. Combining the dip with the horiz.ontal component, the total intensity as observed at Fort Conger becomes 12.870 British units, or 0.5934 dyne, for the epoch 1882.2. By comparison it was found that the dip had been increasing since 1875-'76 at an annual rate of 1'.6. The dates of auroral displays are next enumerated, and extracts are given of the character of the more imposing auroras. Then follows a table of magnetic results collected during explora. tions by different parties and extracted from Lieutenant Greely's narrative. The paper concludes with a general collection of magnetic results obtained from the expeditions of Kane, 1853-'55; of H.Ex.17-14

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Hayes, 1860-'61; of Hall, 1871-'73; of Nares, 1875-'76, and from Lieutenants Crosby and Sebree, of the Bear and Thetis, in 1884. From these observations it is concluded that for the last twentyfive years, at least, the magnetic west declination has been annually decreasing about 6' in the region of the North 'Vater, Smith Strait and Kane Basin, and that in the region to the north of it, and including the Hall Basin, this decrease was fully 10' per year during the past decade. In close connection with the scheme of physical researches undertaken by the International Arctic Committee, the desirability of a new determination of the American pole of dip does not appear to have been urged. It must be admitted that the region is difficult of approach, yet the gain to our knowledge of terrestrial magnetism and its secular changes would be equally certain if it could he successfully explored. More than half a century has elapsed since Ross made his memorable and bold dash to this point, but science nowadays will demand more, and the whole region in that vicinity would have to be surveyed in order to permit the tracing out of isoclinics or the application of a suitable analytical process to bring out the facts of the case, as, in consequence of local deflection, there may be many points of vertical dip covering or distributed over a considerable area. From the time of Hansteen, early in this century, to the present time, efforts have been made to trace out the supposed motion of the interse~tion of the so-called magnetic axis with the surface. While some physicists hold it to be fixed in position, others believe it to have a slow secular motion of limited extent, and still others would give to it a rapid motion with a path which will carry it clear round the geographical pole. The time bas certainly arrived when in this matter facts shall take the place of speculation. The writer has the assurance of the willingness of three distinguished American arctic explorers to undertake this task; the one thing lacking is the necessary funds to sustain the explorer, say, for two yea:Ps. Here surely is a fine field opeu in which to gain well-merited distinction,

By HENRY MITCHELL. As!!listant.

Co.AST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

Washington, D. 0.
Sm: In the Annual Report Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1885, page 33, an extract is made from my annnal report which refers to a table computed by Mr. J. A. Sullivan, the last work executed for us by that gentleman. This table is a valuable ext.ension of one printetl nuder the title "Estuary of the Delawar(',' 1 on page 245 of the Annual Report Coast and Geodetic Stu,·ey for 1883. To preserve this valuable table, which is likely to be useful for reference, I suggest that it ho printed. Very respectfully, yours, HENRY MITCHELL. Mr. F. M. THORN,

Superintendent (Joast and Geodetic Survey.

REPORT OF THE RESULTS OF SPIRIT-LEVELING OF PRECISION ABOUT NEW YORK BAY AND VICINITY IN 1886 AND 1887.
Observations by Assistant JOI-I:N E. ~EIR and Subassistant J. E. McGRATH. cussion by CHARLES A. SCHOTT, Assistant. Dis-

COMPUTING DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

ltforch 9, 1888. DEAR SIR: I herewith respectfully submit a report of the resultR of spirit-leveling of precision about New York Bay and dcinity in 1886 and 1887, made in connection with the hydrographic resurvey of the approaches to New York. · Route-line of levels.-In 188G the Jevels were carried from Astoria, near Hell Gate, to Hunter's Point; thence via Winfi.elll to Flushing, and passing Strattonport and Whitestone, they terminate at \Villet's Point, opposite Tltrog's Neck, at the western end of Loug Island Sound. There are several branch lines and offsets connecting with tide-gauges, also a crossing of the East R.iver at Eighty.fourth street. These route-lines are shown on the accompanying map (Illustration No. 43), together with otiler features, for ready reference to any of the elevations determined. In 1887 the main line was fully developed from Red Bank, N. J., where it taps the line of spirit-levels coming from Sandy Hook, a portion of Assistant A. Braid's line of 1881,· to Hunter's Point, crossing on tbe way Arthur Kill at Perth Amboy, and the Narrows at Forts Tompkins and Wadsworth. After skirting Brooklyn the route connects at Hunter's Point with the preceding year's work. The line is again taken up at Eighty-fourth street, New York, whence it crosses Man· hattau Island to the Hudson River at Forty-second Rtreet, the eastern shore of which it follows as high up as Dohbs' Ferry, a distance of about 19 statute miles. On this line there are likewisA numerous branch lines conn~cting with tide-water. Among these are lines to Port Monmouth and to Conaskonk Point via Keyport, N . · T.; to Great Kills, Staten Island; to Const.able Hook and Elizabethport, N. J., to head of Newark Bay, New Jersey; to Gravesend Bay, Long Island, to Governor's Island and other places as shown on the map. Distance along the line of levels from Red Bank, N. J., to Dobbs' Ferry, N. Y., 116.5 kilometers (72.4 statute i:niles); length of branches and offsets, 78.5 kilometers (48.8 statute miles); total development of leveling, 195.0 kilometers (or 121.2 statute miles). Obser·i:ers and dates of leveling.-The observations of 1886 were made by Subassistant John E. McGrath, aided by H. P. Ritter as recorder, two rodmen and two men for general work; the lines were run between October 16 and N<lvernber 22. Th{'. observations of 1887 were made in part by Assistant John B. Weir, aided by Subassistant J.E. McGrath and extra Observer ·w. B. Fairfield, and, after Mr. Weir's assignment to other duty, by Mr. McGrath, assisted by John Nelson, Aid, -who had joined the party a short time before the change, which took place June 7, 1887. Work was commenced April 19 and terminated September 5. About one-third of the season's work was done under the charge of the first observer, the remaining two· thirds under his successor. Instruments.-Tn 1886 the lines were run with geodetic level No.1. This instrument is described in Appendix No. 11, Coast and. Geodetic Snrvey Report for 1880, and illustrated on Plates Nos. 46 and 4.7 of that report. Metric rods A, and B were used in connection with this instrnment. For description of rods and targets see Appendix No. 15, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1879.

:t: Record not given anrl not. recol·ered.

Spider-threads were used in the diaphragms in preference to lines on glass; the telemeter threads were nearly equidistant from the middle thread. Level No. 1 had 4 horizontal threads, distance between the upper and tlie middle and between the lower and the middle as girnn in the preceding table; level No. 2 had 4 and level No. 3 had 2 threads, with distances of the extreme lower one from the middle as given in the table. The value of 1 turn of the micrometer for instru· ments 2 and 3, as used in the computation, was 257".5, and increas·ing turns for all instruments correspond to elevating the eye-end of the telescope. Respecting the correction for inequality of collars, attention was paid to the change due to wear during the progress of the work. The comparisons of the rod meters with the standard remain as given in the report on the levels of the Mobile-New·Orleans line, ~.\.ppeudix No. fJ, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1887; accordingly rods A,, B, E, F were of standard length at 67°.0 Fah. (19°.4 0.), 71·.7 Fah. (220.1 C.), 620.1 Fah. (160.7 C.), and at 660.1 Fah. (180.9 0.), respectively. The index errors of A, aud B do not come into consideration, since in 1886 one line was run with A, exclusively and the other with B, and the rods were always placed on the top of the benches or other points of reference. Rods E and F were used in 1887. Their index corrections were found as follows: Rod E, projection beyond zero, 62mm,3; Rod F, 60mm,l, as determined April 4 and September 20, 1887, I showing a wear of but omm.3. 1lfethods of observing.-Wben running the lines of levels in 1886 the manner of procedure was as follows: After the instrument was adjusted and leveled, rod .A, was observed as backsight, and immediately afterwards, while A, was being carried forward, a backsight was taken on rod B which had been placed near A,, then foresight readings were made first on A, and immediately after on B near lly. Thus two parallel lines were run simultaneously, a method ahandoned the next season as not affording a complete check, the conditions of the instrument and of the atmosphere being the same for each line. The average distance from staff to staff was rather over 200 meters, but

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

277

the instrument generally was not placed midway between. A, and B were kept close together within a few meters. In 1887, when running the main line between Stapleton, Staten Island, at the Narrows, and Hunter's Point, Assistant Weir made the backward measures, starting from Runtel''s Point with level No.3, aniJ Subassistant McGrath made the forward measures over the same ground, starting _ from Stapleton with level No. 2, both observers using the same bench-marks for the determination of the probable uncertainty of the results. This is considered tlie most perfect arrangement for securing two absolutely independent measures. A few unavoidable exceptions to this rule occur on side lines or offsets, but in all cases two Jines were run for a check. Betwee'l Red Bank and Stapleton the forward measurement was run partly by McGrath using le>el No. !! and partly by Nelson using level No. 3, and the backward measurement was run in the same way with tolerable regularity. From Eighty-fourth street, New York, to Dobbs' Ferry both forward and backward measurements were run with level No. 3, but how much of share each observer had does not fully appear from the record. All side lines and offsets were leveled twice, governed more by expediency than by systematic method. · The average distance from staff to staff when grades did not force shorter sights was about 190 meters, and the instrument as a rule was about midway between the two staves. Rods B and. F were used during the entire seaso11. Two instruments were employed for the crossings of Arthur Kill and at the Narrows. In the latter case the individual results for difference in height of the two hench-marks, Nos. 70 and 71, located on opposite sides, are reasonably accordant; the di-stance between these benches was 1450 meters, or but 159 meters short of a statute mile, as determined by triangulation. In the handling of the instrument a change was made in the method formerly pursued; insteatl of setting tho bubble of the level against a selected division of the tube and recording the corresponding micrometer reading, the bubble is now set exactly in the middle of tlrn tube. The ~suc cessive operations are then as follows: Reading of micrometer for bubble iu middle, reading of micromeier for backsight on target, reversal of levels ou collars, readings for target and level as before, inversion of telescope about its axis (to correet for eollimation error), with repetition of operations similar to above four readings, reversal of instrument 180° ia azimuth, with repetition of the operations similar to above eight operations for the foresights. Computations.-Each observer furnished a complete re<luctiou of Lis work; at the Offine a second and more elaborate computation was made in Mcordance with the general rule of the Sune_y. The levels ofl886 werecornputecl by L.A. Bauer, who also reduced those made in 1887 by Assistant Weir, while Snbassistant :McGrath's levels of 1887 were computed by Mr. Weir while temporarily attached to the Computing Division since about the middle of October last. Tlle means of the readings of the horizon and the target are made out and the corrections to the latter for micrometric difference, for inequality of collars, for refraction and curvature, are severally applie<l, and the difference of elevation of two stations is further corrected for expansion or contraction of the brass scales when their temperature differs from the standard temperature at which they are of normal length; the index correction of the staves is applied whenever needed. The reduction is facilitated by tables depending on the instrumental constants and other data of the measures. The results being collated and any appreciable difference correct.cd or explained, the probable errors of the operation are deduced and the final results are tabulated and reported on. Resulting eleva.tions.-Tbey are given in the usual tabular form and require but little additional explanation. The initial plane of reference is the average or roughly. so-called half-tide level of the Atlantic Ocean based upon tidal observations made at Sandy Hook, N. J., between the years 1876 and 1881, as discussed in Appendix No. 11, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1882. We have transferred from the same report for convenience of reference the few results.of 1881 of the common line, Sandy Hook to Red Bank, N. J., bench-mark E, at which place the levels of 1886-'87 connect with those of 1881, i.e., with the average sea level. The separate results, however, required to be combined anew. The leveling of 1881 was carried out nuder iustructions, which demanded the running of two simultaneous parallel lines, but also obliged the observer to run for a limited

distance an independent third liue in a direction the opposite of the two parallel lines, in order that the efficiency of the method of running parallel lines might be tested. Subsequently, experience having decided in favor of two independent lines, run in opposite directions, the work of 1887 was carried out by this more satisfactory method; that of 1886, however, had inadvertently been conducted by the old method. In the following table of results we have consequently prese.nted the individual measures between the tide-house mark and the bench-mark at Red Bank, combined in accordance with tile principle now recognized as the best. The rwerage sea level adopted here is the same as that on which the 1881 line is based, and is the result of the discussion by the harmonic analysis of tidal observations at Sandy Hook during the six years 1876 to 1881.4 For com·enience of reference the tabular results are given first for the main line from Sandy Hook to Dobbs' Ferry, arranged in five sections; this is followed by the branch lines and offsets.

* Since the accumulated discrepancies in the work of 1886 depend on the differences between the first (A) and second (B) measures,
and not as in 1887 on the differences between the forward and backward measures, a new start had to be IQade with Station No. 39 , adopting o.o for it. The accumulated discrepancy from Sandv Hook to this station was only about 2 millimeters.

.Accuracy of the preceding results for heights.

289

The proba.ble errors of the resulting heights are based as usual upon the observed differences of heights resultiug from the forward and backward independent measures for a number of benchmarks in the line oflevels. For comparison of the a.ccuracy reached in various hues it is customary to compute the probable error of the measures for one kilometer as the unit of distance, and in accordance with the method of least squares as applied to spirit-leveling, we take the probable error of leveling to be proportional to ../i, or what comes to the same thing, we take the weight w of a resu1t to be inversely proportional to the distances; hence, w = ~. Let d =difference of the results deduced from the forward and backward independent measures for any mark at the distance s. d is generally expressed iu milli· meters and s in kilometers. n =the number of such differences or the number of separate lines composing the whole distance between the initial and terminal points. -in, and ni 11 =the mean error of a single leveling and of a double leveling, respectively, of one kilometer or for unit of length. Then,

m,=J 2~ [d~]

and

m,
m" =
~'},

If r 11 and 1· are the respective probable errors of double leveling for a line of unit length (on6 kilometer) and for a line of length S, then r 11 = 0.675 m11 and r =0.675 m11 ../ff or r 11 ..,/s In case the successive marks are distributed over the line with tolerable regularity at distances of one kilometer, the above formula; become simplified, since w = 1 nearly, and the probable error of a resulting difference of heiglit from a double measure of a length of one kilometer becomes /(ddJ . 0.675 V 4 (8]' and consequently the probable error for a t;erminal point at the distance S = [s] will

be r = 0.675 Jl~dJ. In the present case the more exact formulre first given have been applied with the following results for probable error arising purely from the operation of spirit-leveling:

*All differences between first and second-iine~;~rk ~f 't.886, were increased by one-fourth pa.rt to allow for the circumstance that differences. derived from parallel simultaneous Imes do not give the whole discrepancy, since the state of the atmosphere and the condition of the instrument are the same for both lines ; the fraction U is an approJ<imate allowance.

The probable error of pure leveling (mean, forwards and backwards) of one kilometer on the average for the whole line is but :!: 1.11 millimeters; for the older line between Sandy Hook and Hageratown, Md., run by Assistant A. Braid in 1881 by means of spirit-level No. I, we found :I: 1.03 millimet.ers for parallel simultaneous lines (Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1882, p. 522), which, when referred to two independent lines, must ue increased by a.bout one-fourth, hence r" = ± 1.28 millimeters; for the diffionlt line between Mobile, Ala., a.nd New Orleans, J..a., As· sistant Weir reached iu 1885-'86, with levels No.1 and No. 3, the extraordinary lowvttlue r,,:;; .;;t:0.67 nnllimet.ers.

We have also for our line the mean error of a ·single measure for one kilometer m1 = :!: 2.33 .nillimeters, which -iuantity rua;r advantageously be used for comparisons. As far as the figures in column "Accumulated discrepancy" show, our results appear to be free of any error al ways tending in the same way; thus at the close of the line the total accumulation is but eight-tenths of a millimeter, and nowhere does it rise beyond 25.6 millimeters; in other words, nowhere do the two independent lines give results separated by more than 1 inch. To find the probable error of any of the bench-marks above the average sea-level the probable error of the determination of the latter or :!: 9.1 millimeters must be combined with that arising from the leveling operation proper; thus for the probable error of tlrn resulting height of tlie mark at Dobbs' Ferry we have v'(9.1) 2 + (13.4) 2 = :!:: 15mm.2 (about two-thirds of an inch), and similarly for the mark at Willet's Point,
v(9.1) 2

+ (14.2)2 =

:!:: 15mm.9

The absolute height of any of the bench-marks determined by our levels may therefore be considered known as being subject to no greater probable error than::!:: 17 millimeters, ortwo-tbirds of an inch. The operation of spirit-leveling formed part of the new bydrographic survey of the port of New York and approaches, prosecuted during 1886 and 1887, and the resulting heights of tbe many bench-marks herewith presented are intended to serve as permanent results of reference and remain available for any engineering works that demand an accurate knowledge of the height of the sea level. Additional tidal observations may hereafter change all the results by a small constant cor· rec ti on. The many tidal stations established in 1886 had for their 01.Jject the investigation of the tidal laws in these waters, and their connection with the spirit-levels will serve to show lww far the average sea-level may be assumed to be the same within the limits of the inquiry. This report contains the means for making this comparison. The remaining pages contain descriptions of the bench-marks, but for many of the places the records at the Survey Office contain additional information and rough sketches of the locality. Copies of these descriptions may be had on application. Yours, respectfully, CHARLES A. SCHOTT, Assistant. Mr. B. A. COLONNA, Assi,stant in eharge Office and Topography.

It is the first or starting mark to which the average height of the ocean has been referred. [The tidal observations at this place commenced in October, 1875, and came to a close in September, 1884; a short revival between .April and October, 1885, not proving satisfactory, the station was abandoned in consequence of certain difficulties attending the locality. A new tidal station was established in 1886 on an adjacent wharf, which is referred to further on.-Scn.] A and B of 1881.-Sandy Hook, N. J.; are cedar posts 8 feet long and 8 inches in diQ.tneter, sunk in the ground with ends projecting about 4 inches. In the ceuter of ea.ch p0st is a copper nail surrounded by five others in form of a pentagon. These posts are 12 met.era apart and bear ENE. from the steamer landing and nearly northeast from the tide-house, and are distant from the latter about 500 meters. They are also 95 meters NW. of the railroad red engine-house, and a.re in the edge of the cedars where the ground is elevated a few feet above the marsh. {Description of 1881; for new bench-mark T of 1886 see further on.]

it is a cross made in a stone of the retaining wall, on the left when coming from the dock into the post grounds. The zero of the engineers' gauge is 2.139 feet above the zero of the Coast and Geodetic Survey gauge, and the engineers' bench-mark is (above the zero of the engineers' gauge) 18.056 feet (October 9, 1886). The records in the archives of the Survey generally contain additional detail information to the above, and the descriptions are accompanied by sketches of the locality; copies of these may be had on application to the Survey Office.

Supplementar11 note to preceding paper.
Taking advantage of tbe time available before the printing of the annual report, some further results may now be given the data for which were not accessible at the time when writing the report. (I) Additional information respecting the average sea-level at Sandy Hook.-Tl.tis le\'el, upon which the heights of the spirit-levels (which are ultimately to cross the continent from ocean to ocean) depend, reads on the tide-gauge 8.561 feet, as given in Appendix N o.11, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1882; it is the result of six years of observations. Since that time the ti(1es have, with some unavoidable interruptions, oontinued to be observed, and we can now add to the former values for the reading of the half-tide level, as derived from the high and low waters, the following values, for which I am indebted to Mr. Alexander S. Christie, Chief of 'l'idal Division of this Office, who communicated them with all desirable detail, under date of October 17, 1888. From the series January 1, 1882, to .August 31, 1884, we obtain 8.719 feet :1::0.030 foot, and from the series December 1, 1886, to March 31, 1888, the half-tide level 8.634 feet ::l:0.023foot. The latter series is far superior in accuracy to the first; both are corrected for annual inequality, as was necessary, since the series do not group themselves by years. They have reference to the same bcuch-mark A as in 1881. Comparing these values with the six annual ''alues for the S·ears18761881, given on page 519 (ibid.), we find them to be included within the extreme values of that set. The eight values roughly combined would give 8.590 :1::0.025 feet in the place of 8.561 ±0.029 feet. as found by me in June, 1882; the difference, 0.029foot or 8.8 millimeters, is too small to be applied at 11resent as a correction· to the heights of the line of levels of 1882 and of 1886-'87; moreover, the tidal observations are still going on and in course of time will yield a final value, wLich, however, may be supposed not to fall outside the limits covered by the present assigned probable error; hence no change will be made in the results of the above reports. (2) Comparison of tlte res1tlts of the spirit-leveling with the water levels observed in 1886, 'in con· nection with tJ~e hydrological survey <>f New York Harbor and approaclws.-The tides were observed by the party of Assistant H. L. Marindin in September and October, 1886. At four stations only do the observations cover as much as one lunation ; these are Sandy Hook, Governor's Island, Willet's Point, and Dobbs' Ferry. At the other nineteen l!econdary and simultaneously occupied stations the comparative observations extend ,over a few days only. In the construction of the following table of comparisons the differential method was used, Mr. Marindiu having collated the reading of the average sea-level at each place resulting from the hourly ordinates of the tides and the reault of the corresponding hourlJJ ordinates as observed at Sandy Hook, which was selected as the comparing station; this information, combined with the mark and staff reading of the average Rea-level at each place resulting from the -operation of spirit-leveling, indicated how much at each station the local level was found to be above or below the average Sandy Hook level. By the differential method the effect of the annual inequality in the average sea-level is eliminat.ed. The magnitude of this inequality, as given by Mr. A. S. Christie, may be seen from the following table deriverl by him from forty-seven ffl()ntha between January l, 188.2, and April 1,, 1888. A positive sign indicates elevatfon above, a negative sign depr~slHoa below the average sea-level; the time refers to the middle of each 111-0nth, and the amount i.s given iD feet and deeinmls of a foot. --------------·-~--

"If applied it would ma.ke the height of the tide-house bench-mark above the sea-level 11.415 feet or 3m.4793 ±Om.0076, and all other heights depending on it would have to be reduced by the ea.me amount csmm.B).

Accordingly, during the time the comparative observations were made the sea-level is supposed to have stood about 0.28 foot above tbe normal Jev-el, and this would of course be the same for all the stations. In strictness simultaneous comparisons of heights sllould lrn.ve reference rather to identity of phase; thus the tide requires twenty-nine minutes· to travel over the 19 statute miles from Sandy Hook to Governor's Island; the inaccuracy arising from uou-attention to this circumstance would be small and is practically eliminated from tlle results by beginning and ending the comparisons with the same phase of the tide, i. taking full cycles. All comparisons are made with the Sandy Hook series, since this is the only one which ext-ends oyer the whole of the time during which at any one place tidal observatious were made. The tabular results were checked by a second reduction under the direction of Mr. Christie, who, for the sake of simplicit;r, used high and low waters only in tbe place of hourly ordinates, but reached nearly the same result.s. As an example of the derivation of the tabular quantities I present the case for Port Mon· mouth, ~. J.: At Sandy Hook.-Eight-foot mark of tide-staff above the average sea level derived from six years of observations, 1.265 meters or 4.151 feet; hence reading of average sea level on staff, 3.849 feet. The mean hourly reading of this staff during September 22-25, 1886, when corresponding tidal observations were had at Port Monmouth, was 3.891, or 0.042 foot higher than the average sea-level. At Port Monmouth.-Eight-foot mark of tidM1taff above the average sea level at Sanely Hook as brought to Port Monmouth by means of spirit-leveling, 1.675 meters ur 5.496 feet; hence reading of average sea-level of Sandy Hook, 2.504; and since the level during September 22-25 was 0.42 above this, the Port Monmouth reading correspondiug to the above mean hourly reading at Sandy Hook is 2.546 feet, the actual or local reading of the ordinates was 2.348; hence apparently the average sea-level at Port Monmouth below that of Sand~, Hook, 0.198 foot. This is indicated by a minus sign in the table.

The figures in the last column but one apparently indicate a lower average level than that at Sandy Hook for all the interior stations, an inadmissible result, which can only be explained by some defect in the connection of the levels with the staff at Sandy Book; in fact, Assistant Marindin thinks it not impossible that the wharf to whieb the staff was attached had changed its level, due to the raising action of ice during tlie severe winter intervening between the observations and the lev«l connection. Be this as it mas, the mean level of the lower bay as given b,y the six stations Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, and by No. 18 must be identical with that of the ocean outside, hence the excess at Sandy Hook is 0.176 ± 0.014 foot, which amount, when added to the respective figures previously given, is contained in the last column of tlie table aml shows the resulting differences of height in the mean or half· title level at the several localities. Tbe probable error of auy of these figures is about ::!:: 0.06 foot or ::!:: three-quarters of an inch-an accuracy which speaks well, particularly for the short series of tidal observations. The rise of mean level at Dobbs' Ferry is accordingly 0.18 foot or 2.2 inches, with a probable uncertainty of about a quarter of au iuch. (3) Propagation of the tide-u:ave up the bay and harbor.-In connection with the above investigation of the mean level, and as a hydrodynamical subject of iuterest, I may be permitted to present here a brief inquiry into the velocity of the tidal wa,·e, 'l"fhilc trayeling up from Saud_y Book and past the city to Dobbs' Ferry. This kind of wave, which has been called by ltussell tlrn solitary, the primary waYe oft.he first order, or great wa>e of tmuslation, travels along a channel, according to this authority, with a velocity of trausmissiou nearly equal to tllat whh~h a heavy hotly would acquire in freely falling t.hrough a space half the depth of tlie fluid. The Yelocity is therefort· 11 = ./g(p ::!:: Ii.)~ where g =acceleration of gravity (9.805 meters or 3'.!.17 feet nearly, p = the dt'pth of fluid 1mpposed at rest, and h = th<~ height of the crest of the warn 1thove thi1:1 plmie of repose; the positive sign is to be used for the incoming flood tide, which is a positiYe wave, and the minus si~u will have to be used for the outgoing or ebb tide, which is a negative waYe. This formula is due to Lagrange, but is generally known as Russell's or Air_y's,* and supposes to apply to waves moY~ing in water of unlimited expanse. .According to Hagen t the form ·r = ..; f gp agrees better with his own experiments. Scott Russell points out that whe11 a wave of translation enters a comparatively narrow channel, as a river, for instance, with a variable crose-section, the average depth should be substituted for the maximum depth along the channel. As the depth of a channel decreases, the velocity of transmission decreases, but the height of the wave increases; should, farther on, the depth be again iucreasing, the velocity would likewise increase, but the height of the wave would decrease. The height of a waye in a channel of uniform depth, but contracting in width, will varJ· as the squarea1·oot of the width. The friction, internal between the particles of water and external at bottom and sides (and on the surface), will finally consume the original energy of the wave. Applying the formulre to the case of the flood wave propagated from Sandy Hook to Governor's Island we haye: Average depth at row water along the channel way, 7.36 fathoms, range of tide (trough to crest), 4.u feet; hence p + I~ = 48.7 feet or 14.85 meters; hence t' = l:!.01 meters per secoml according to Russell and 14.78 meters acconliug to Hagen. Distance or length of patl1, 19 statute miles or 30.f>7 kilometers; hence time required for transmission, 42.2 minutes (Hussell) aud 3'! .."i minutes {Hagen). The actual or observed time is 29 minutes, according to Ferrel's" Tidt'8 at, Go\·ernor's Islaml" (Appendix 13, Coast aud Geodetic Survey HPport for 1885), but 32 minutes according to the Coast aud Geodetic Survey "Tide-Tables for 1889" (pp. 216, 217). It may be remarked that it is not easy to get the exact time of transmission of such an immense]~- fiat wave as the tidal wave. The accord between theory and obserYation is tolerably good, notwithstanding the circumstance of an interference tidal wave entering at Throg's Neck, which makes the average

The distance is 24 statute miles or 38.62 kilometers; hence time of transmission, 59.8 minutes (Russell) and 48.9 minutes (Hagen), whereas the observed time is 72 minutes (Tidtl-Tables); here we have a deviation in the op posit~ direction from that in the first ap.plication, but I have doubts as to the reliability of the observed interval. The flow of the ri vcr is not supposed to have much influence on the time of ascent of the wave.

REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THE PHYSICAL SURVEYS OF NEW YORK HARBOR.

By

HEN~Y

l\.:t:ITCHELL, As;;i,.tant.

MARCH 24, 1888.

SrR: I submit the following as my annual report. It includes the data sent to the Board of Engineers, except as regards the observations made by Mr. Marindin's party in 1887. '.l'he report is in two pvts, the first i;howing the relation!! of the Hudson to the Bar, and the second the i;ame river's rela.tion to the Hell Gate Entrance. It briugs the outstanding work to a close, except that it does not state results from last summer's work (now being reduced), not does it present the subject of "water contom·s" which Mr. Marindin will report upon. Very respectfully, ;yours,

HENRY MITCHELL, Assistant Coast and Grodetic Survey.
Mr. F. M. THORN, Superintendent Coast and Geodetic Survey.

PART

1.-THE UNDER-RUN OF THE HUDSON RIVER.
ITS RELATION '.l'O NEW YORK BAR.

The discovery of a resultant or net discharge through New York Harbor from Long Island Sound to the ocean, which formed the subject of my report of last year (and which was inserted as .Appendix 13 in the Annual Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1886, th~ in llfess), was the result primarily of a somewhat theoretical study of combinations of oorpentine curves. It was shown that for any harbor of two dissimilar approaches tile alt<irnate slopes induced in the harbor by the presence of two tides might be equal, i.e., the same for the movement one way as for the mm·ement the other way, but that the discharges induced by these slopes could not be equal because the slopHs occur at different stageR, and different stages imply different sections and perimeters of channel. The proposition was proven geometrically before we appealed to the observations for confirmation.· \Ve mention this because there are so many influences of winds and river outflow to be canceled in tbe strictly induct.ive process that we should not feel sure of our result if not otherwise proven.
·First stated iu "Science," il!llue of March 4, 1887, under title "Circulation of the sea through New York Harbor."

301

302

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The numerical value of the "resultant," which we may state at three to four hundred millions of cubic foet in a half-tidal day, can only be re1lucell to the a\'erage for the year by having simul- ., taneom; tiditl observations ma.de at the two eutra nces to our scene. We have furnished coefficients with snch hoped.for observations in view. And now we are led back to a re-examination of one of our oldest themes, viz, the under-run, which presents, in the dry season, mt antithesis to the'' resultant" of our previorns paper. We are accustomed to apply the term under-run lllstinctively to the current that predominates along the bed of the channel carrying salt water to interior basins during the dry season, when tlie kead of 'tbe river falls below that which is necessary to conn terbalance the heavier waters of the sea. The specific gravity of the sea beyond New York Bar is about 1.024; i.e., the sea is about 2~ per ceut. heavier than fresh water. If (for illustration) we suppose the basin of the Hudson connected with the sea Ly a continuous channel 100 feet deep, the surface of the riv1 r water would _have to starnl 2~ feet aho\'e the ocean to prevent the salt water trom running in along the bottom; and the sea-water wot1ld creep into tbe basin as soon as the bead fell below tl1is.t Our problem is much less simple tlrnn onr illustration, because we have really no constancy of depth or slope for any length of time or space. Although the Hudson is an unusually deep aud straight riYer, its direct communication with the sea is interrupted by the Bai·, which is a submerged dam. The depth that can be carried O\'er the Lest cbannel'at the Bar is less than the channel depth along the course of the Hudson for 100 miles. 'fhirty-six feet can be ca1Tie<l from tlw Lower Quarantine to the middle of the Tapvau Sea, 33 nautical miles: and 30 feet to Rondout, 8.'.i uautical miles. We may ignore for the present the Hell Gate Entrance, which is of ample depth, but narrow and crooked, and consider only the direct course from the Lower Bay of New York.· The following table aml diagram are compiled by Mr. E. E. Haskell and Mr. Homer P. Ritter from obsen·ations made in the parti~s of Assistants H. L. Marindiu and Marcus Baker, with whom the first two were associated as experts. Diagram A (Illustratiou No 44) show" how the sea nuder lies the rh·cr water from actual observations as grouped by lunar hours upou Table No. 1.
·The first notice of the existence of this under-run appears in my obl!ervations in New York Narrows July 30, 1838, but it was not until 1852 that I connected tho phenomenon definitely with the rise aud fall of the fresh-water ltead of the Hudson. (See Annual Report of Coost Survey, 18-59, for description and sketch of subcurrent apparatus, aud Annual Report Coast Survey, 1863, for review of my letter to I'rofessor Bache, Superintendent.) We began in 1860 to make regular observations of density in connection with current observations. In the "Science" article above mentioned the decline of the fresh-water discharge in winter, wbeu the trib11taries are all ice-bound, was stated without proof. In casting about for a proper support to this statement I have come acr()88 a letter from Prof. \Volcott Gihhs (Appendix 6:3, Annual Report Coast Survey, 1856) on "An analysis of s11ecimens of water from New York Harbor." These specimens were collected by myself in March, 1856. One of them taken from,. bole in the ice off Fort Washington, about One hundred and fifty-1>ecoml street, gave 1.0126; another from otf Pier No. 1, near Castle Ga.rden, gave 1.0183 as specific weigl1ts, about the same that we find at the close of summer in those neighborhoods. Drought and long-continued freezing produce like effects. t See Part 2 of this paper.

UNITED STATES OOAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

As stated above, 30 feet is the channel depth of the Hudsou; 22 per cent. of 30 feet gives O. 75 foot as the head necessary to counterbalance the sea, and the tidal observatiens of 1856, with the line of levels which connected their bench references, give West Point, 53 nautical miles from Lower Quarantine, as the station where mean level lay 0.75 foot above the sea in that dry season of the year.· In our report made in l\Iay, 1873, it is stated that ''during the past two seasons we haye taken pains to measure densities, aud have traced the sea-water along the channel bed as high up as Carthage, 70 miles from Sandy Hook; but the surface water was found essentially fresh at Teller's Point, 43 miles from Sandy Hook," at the head of the Tappan Sea.t By the old series of tirlal observations and levels, to which we have referred above, the head at Carthage (64 miles from Lower lluarantine) was, in September, 1856, 0.86 foot above the sea, which for a 30-foot co11tinuous chmmel should have expelled the sea-water requiring only 0.75 foot liead. The autumn of 1871 was eYidentl.r a season of lower stage than 1856. Our observations of SeJltember 20, 1871, at Carthage showed the densities to be 1.0000 at surface, 1.0015 at 30 feet, and 1.0015 <>t 48 feet, while just above, at Barnegat (<HJ miles from Lower Quarantine) the water was fresh from top to Lottom. In Octouer, 1886, 1'fr. Haskell and msself sought again the limits of the under-run, and found it at Cold Spring (61 nautical miles from Lower Quarantine) 1 only lt miles above the station (West Point) at which we have placed the tlieoretical limit, based upon the tiJes of 1856, as we haYejust seen. There is a good deal of mere coincidence in the agreement of our figures for different seasons, but good field-notes a re very apt lo fit trell together. l\Ir. Haskell has suggested tllat "it is at once more logical and simple to compare differences of dcusity with differcncus of surface eleYation," and tllus avoid reference to the unconscious sea as a llase, and I agree with him, provided that we eliminate the tide. If from the tidal obsena. tions of Mr. H. L. J\fatiwlin's party in 1886, we take the mean Je,·el at tile cutrancc to the Tappan Sea, we find it was 0.25 foot above New York Harbor, 21 nautical miles below. In order to balance so small a head as tllis, the difference of density need not have been more than fi ve-tllousandtlls, whereas we kuow that it is usually three times as much in the dry season, and hence the accumulation of sea-water which we have found again aml again every dry s';,ason in the bottom of tpe Tappan Sea, and e\·en to its r,urface occasionally. This basin may have received its name in the autumn wheu it had become a, veritable arin of the sea. Of course the under-run tends to raise the ri\'er, increasing the slope in one direction (seaward) and diminishiug it iu the other; it therefore quickens the surface outflow transiently. Even the profile of the tide must lie changed by it. Because of the effect of tide upon slope, we should expect changes in the salt-water limits from day to day, the last distinct traces being found in potholes. The deep pass through the Highlands is, as we have seen, invaded by the sea. At a station half way between Dunderberg and Anthony'8 Nose, Mr. Marin din and myself found, in September, 1871, that the first 30 foet of water was fresh, while at the depth of 120 feet the specific gravity was 1.002.J, or one-tenth part sea-water. To refor again to our report of 1873 we call attention to the following statement: "The Bar at tile entrance to New York Harbor does not lie in tile dead angle between fresh and salt water; but at the depth of 2~ feet, which is that of Urn Bar chanucl, there is still ample seaward scouriug force all aloug the line." I<'rom our ohservatio11s of 18851 Mr. Homer P. Hitter has compiled for us the velocitit'S au1l dcooities of tlic water at different depths. See Table No. 2 and Diagram B (Illustrations Nut-5. 45 aml 46), which follow:

F. l'ourtales made soon after the tides and levels were observe·l ( 1856-'ii7). tThis report of 1873 was appended to Auunal Repo1·t of the Coast Snl'vey for 1871 (which lingered long enough in press to receive this paper), anil aho ap1>eared as a. i·amphlet i8sued by the New York Chamber of CollUllerce, entitled "New York Harbor, i't!I conditiou, May, ltsi;>,"

We have re-opened this question of tLe "deau angle," or, as we should 11ow prefer to say, the neutral plane, because of its critical relation to the resultant scour at the Bar. lfoviewing the observations of the past years we have drawn up a table (No. 4) in which the point in each vertical is given at which inflow and outflow balance. No attempt is made to reconcile discordances.

At the station between Bedloe's and Governor's Islands, September 1, 1858, there was found more under-run near the bottom than outflow at surface; i.e., more flood along the bottom than el>b at surface. In our report of 1873 we ventured to say that the neutral point lay below the crest of the bar. The more careful observations and computations given in the foregoing tal>le indicate 33 feet for the Narrows and 20 feet for the Hudson River at 'l'hirty-ninth street. We had written the above clause before it occurred to us to look in our report of 1858-'59 (unpublished) to see what our earliest impressions bad been. This report, after stating relations of densities inducing under-run, says: " · · · different 8tations occupied at various dates do not agree in giving the same position for the neutral line lletween the t \'l'O strata. The transition space, as given upon Diagram O, would seem to lie from 30 to 36 feet below the surface."· (Diagram (J was velocitirs at different depths.) On the outer slope of the B~r we usually found that the r~ult ant movement on the bottvm took a westerly direction, i. e., toward the harbor; but we judged that such might be the case because of the shelter from the ebb that the Bar itself a:fforcled. Of course no great accuracy is claimed for these figures, and our object in quoting from earlier reports is to indicate that we have always reached about the same result as to the plane at which the limit of scour would be reached at New York Bar cluring the dry season; and we have no adequate reason for believing that the under-run determines the position or height of this Bar. As the ebb current fl.owing towards the Narrows from the East River is about as dense as that found 80 feet below the surface in the Narrows (see Table 2), we may conclude that the "resultant from tlie Soorid '' has practically no limit of scour. It was this "resultant from the Sound" that was our theme last :1ear.t The deeper portions of the Hudson River Channel preserve considerable uniformity of width, indicating that in broad portions of the river-the Tappan Sea and Haverstraw Bay, for instancesthe deposits have not been uniformly distributed. If the Tappan Sea were as broad at 30 feet depth as at the surface, there might be five times the u;uler run that now occurs. As compared with Haverstraw, it betrays more earth filling, as if the 11nd.er run bad added its contributions to those oftered by the river. The rate at whrnb the sea-water travels along the bottom of the channel rlepends upon the discrepancy of river-bead and upon the depth-in very dry seasons and in wry great. depths the influx must be most rapid. On September 1, 1858, we found at 68 feet depth, in the channel

(Revised Deoomber, 1862.)" t See "Science" of March 4, 1887, also a report of May «', 1887, on "The Circulation of the Sea through New York Barbor," which was inl!erted a.e Appendix No. 13 in Annual Report Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1886, which still remained in press. .

between Bedloe's and Governor's Island, a rate of ~1 nautical miles per day; while on August 20, 1885, Dobbs' Ferry at depth of 45 feet gave but 6 nautical miles per day. It would seem that the t.lrainage of New York City must be storing up in August and September at the bottom of the Hudson. Some simple tests for sulphides which we employed when the under·rUtJ WdS first dis· co-rnred indicated that the mixture of sea and river water was receut. ~o ''spoiled" water iu the pot-holes of the great central channel was found. Happily for the communities along the Lower Hudson, tlrn floods and freshets occur often enough to purge tlle great trench above New York City of sea-water and sewer-water, in spite of the long inland journeys which these are prone to take in late summer and autumn-and perhaps winter.
LIMIT OF '!'HE TIDE, AS .AFFECTING THE SOOUR OF THE CH.ANNELi IN NEW YORK HARBOR.

The Hudson is occupied by portions of two tides at the same time. When, for instance, it is high water at Sandy Hook, it is low water near Hy<le Park, 4 or 5 miles aboYe Pougbkeept>ie; beyond which the previous tide prevails. In order to ftnd bow much of this wedge-shaped tidal volume between the harbor and Hyde Park may be credited to tbe flood current in tlie harbor channels, we have taken the gaugings of Fort_y-first street and compared the volume entering the river with the accumulation above, after deducting the fresh· water discharg·e of the river for six hours. We have not data enough to fix accurately the extreme limits of tide-water useful to the harbor, but we shall state our approximations. In 1867 we made the limit Verplanck's Poiut (head of Haverstraw Bay); but from the new gangings of Mr. Mai'indin's party iu 1885,Mr. Haskell's computations give Newburgh. He, howm·er, finds that nine-tenths of the useful Yolnme falls below Iona Island in the Highlands, and two·t birds helow the bead of the Tappan Sea. Of course this limit moves down the river (if measurell by the Yolume of flood current) in the freshet seasons; but we do not know to what extent the- simplest "backing up" may be useful in tl1e subsequent" flushing." There are many degrees of uncertainty in this question of the limits of tide-water; but they are mostly beyond practical values. If we include Haverstraw Bay among the tidal reservoirs of New York Har8or, we have not only all the great basins of the river to the extent of five-sixths of its foreign tide.water, but we have gone three tidal hours from the Bar, and four hours, counting interval between the strengths of the ebb current. So much of the foregoing discussion is speculative that we fed co1Jstrained to recapitulate our· firmest conclusions, so far as they may relate to improvements by dredging on encroachments upon tide-water.
RECAPITULATION.

First. The sea-water under-runs the Hudson whenever the fresh-water discharge declines after a dry season or when tributary streams are ice-bound; lmt this does not neutralize the "resultant" from Long Island Sound at present limits of channel depth on the Bar. Second. The tidal system, so far as materially afiecting the f'cour through the harbor of New York and at the Bar, includes the Tappan Sea. Third. There are reasons to believe that se~age from the cities on New York Harbor may at some seasons, more especially in September and March, be stored up for awhile in the river basins

above.

PART

2.-COURSES OF THE HUDSON TIDES THROUGH NEW YORK HARBOR.

When no freshets prevail in the Hudson its waters do not How into Long Islaml Sou11d, hnt directly into the ocean by way of the Narrows, because the surface of the Ea&t Rinr uuriug mueh the larger part of tlte ebb period is inclined in the same direction as tbe Hudson, \iz, towards the Narrows. In short, the Hudson has two outlets for its commerce, but only one/or its waters. We offer the following table of slopes to bear out this testimon~·, and we add detailed accounts of the tidal conditions for each hour to illustrate it:

0 Hours.-At the hour of the moou's transit there is a general concurrence of tidal phenomena in New York Barbor. The Hudson, Kill >an Kull, and East Rivers i1resent surfaces iucliued towards the Upper Bay, and each of tltese a>enues is near its maximum slope for the ebb. In each of these a\enues the currents at all depths take the direction of the surface slope. The ebb cur. rent is near its maximum strength in the East River and Kill \an Kull, at the Narrows and o·er the Bar. In the Hudson the maximum \elocity of ebb is yet two hours Qff, although the surface of Haverstraw Bay lies fully 3 feet abo\e the Upper Hay, and the slope is 0.10 foot to the milt-. (See Diagram C, Illustratious Nos. 47, 48, antl 49;) The East River stream is continuous from the Sound, through New York Harbor, to tlte sea, and runs quite down to tlu: bottom. I.-Oue hour after the transit of the moon the maximum 1.<lope is in the Tappan Sea, where it reaches 1.8 feet in 15 miles or 0.12 foot per mile. Ebb current prevails uot only in the Lower IludHon, but in the East River anil Kills. All slopes are towards the Sandy Hook entrance, except in the Upper Hudson near Poughkeepsie.· II.-Two hours after the moon's transit it is low water in the ocean and high water near Poughkeepsie in the Upper Hudson. New York Harbor has a flat surface about at low.water level, but the Hudson. has still a seaward slope of 0.05 foot per mile abreast of the cit;r and 0.12 foot per mile in the great basin above. The currents of the Lower Hudson, the East Biver, and the Kill nm Kull are all flowing down towards the harbor and through it to the Lower Bay and the ocean. There is some doubt of the generality of our diagram so far as the relations of Sandy Hook and the Narrows are concerned for this hour. · Even in the low-river season the ebb in the track of the Hudson through New York Harbor is found at O, I, and II hours after the transit, running over 40 feet deep. Under-run, even in the Narrows at 80 feet, is rare for th1:1se hours, although, as it happened, on the occasion of our first discovery of the under-run in 1858, we had already at first bour a 11teady in.run at the N-arrows at the depth of 92 feet below the surface.

III.-Three hours after the moon's transit the East River slope vanishes and the ebb current continues to pour into the barbor only by reason of its vis viva. The slope of the Hudson is undergoing reversion. Although them is a very ste,ep sea~ard slope tbrough the great basin (Haverstraw nay aud Tappan Sea), the level surface at Thirty-ninth street is about to ]Je tilted in tlle up-river direction. Of course the river waters are flowing into the harbor and the movement is from surface to bottom. In Kill van Kull tbe current turns from ebb to flood, and in the Narrows the discharge is still seaward, although the current has tul'ned near the bottom. The slope above Thirty-ninth street in the Hudson is 0.03 foot -pel' mile seaward, while the tide J1as begun to rise at Governor's Island, and the Hudson to Thirty-ninth street is a level surface, with low water at the latter place. IV.-Fonr hours after the moon's transit the Lower Hudson presents a concaye surface, the greatest depression being somewhere near the foot of Taviian Sea. The seaward slope iu this "sea" is 0.05 foot to tlie mile, wJiile tlie reverse slope at Castle Garden is 0.05. Still the surface. water has not yet turned from ebb, but below the floocl is setting up along tl1e bottom. The ebb at the foot of the seaward slope at Dobbs' l~Prry mus all 1lle way to the bottom. The discharge is eastward tbrough East Rirnr, westward into Kill Yan Kull, and northward tLrough the Nal'fows; i. flood turough all the gateways except the Hudson. It must be borne in miud that the great mass of water continues its acquired motion after tLe slope has reversecl, but in portions of the channel sheltered from acquired motion the slope acts promptly and the current reverses very soon after the slope re,·erses. (See sketch.)

In this sketch we have supposed oue slope of river surface (ebb) to be represented by a full Jine and the reverse slope (flood) represented liy a dotted line. The reversion bas just taken place, and the great mass of water in continuity retains still the movement impressed upon it, in a direction opposed to the present slope; but in a depression of the bottom tbe water obeys tlle new impulse. One may conceive of a case where sea-water would work up along the bed of a river simply by advancing on the deep-running flood and biding under the <lend angles of the bottom during ebb. It lrns been observed in some of our bays that articles rolling aloug the bottom some. times go up the channel. In our diagram 0 we may conceive of the curve of the fourth lunar hour as the arc of a pendulum, the down-bill }Jortion inducing the motion and the up-bill portion reducing the motion of the great mass, while outlying an<l underlying bodies of water move under the strictly local action of gravity. V.-At the fifth hour after the moon's transit the Lower Hudson presents still a concave surface, the greatest depression being at the foot of Haverstraw Bay, where it is low water. There is also a depression at Throg's Neck (western end of Long Island Sound). The discharge is now noTthward through the Narrows and into the Hudson, westward through the Kills, and eastward through the East River, but there is still at this hour sometimes a surface ebb in the Lower Ruel· son all the way to the harbor. VI.-Six hours after the transit of the moon we find a rising tide and a flood current everywhere in New York Harbor. The tide is three-quarters full in the Upper 13ay,·but it is low water in the Higbla.nds of the Hudson, and it is low water at Throgts Neck or -its 11eighborhood. The current flowing northward into tlie Hudson, east.ward towards the Sound, or westward througli Kill van ;Kull, is strong from surface to bottom.

VIT.-Seven hours after the moon's transit the tide is rising in all parts of New York Harbor, and tl1e flood current is at its strength in the East lUver and in the Hudson, and has scarcely de.clined at the Narrows. Kill van Kull has fallen off co11si<lerably. It is about high water in the ocean beyond the Bar and low water between Newburgh and Poug!Jket>psie 011 the Hudson. From Diagram B one may observe that at Dobb's Ferry (at the entrance to the generally shallow Tappan Sea) and at Kill van Kull (entrance to the shallow Newark Bay) there is a great decline of velocity with the depth. It is at or near this hour that the Lower Hudson lies at greatest slope. VIII.-Eight hours after the transit of the moon it is high water in the Narrows, lmt the cur· rent still runs strong flood from surface to bottom. The Hudson has high water at its mouth, low water just beyond Poughkeepsie, and high water of previous tide above Albany, if completed. There has b'een little reduction of tlrn flood current in the Narrows or in the Hudson River. It is still strong in the Bast mver, but in Kill van Kull it has essentially ceased, and the surface current has reversed, although the flood continues near the bottom. The Upper and Lower Ba,Ys lie at the sa.me level. IX.-Nine hours after the moon's transit it is high water in the Hudson near Yonkers, but below this the tide is falling all along the dit'ect course to the sea, while the East River is essentially flat, i.e., at surface level, throughout, at what ~e have called in our last year's report iti> "upper restorati01i." The flood current prevails everywhere except in Kill van Kull; it is, however, slacking up at the Bar and through the East River.. The Tappan Sea appears to receire its maximum volume on this hour. X.-Ten hours after the moon's transit it is high water in the Tappan Sea and in Hell Gate, and the tidal current has reversed in the Narrows and in the East River, i. e., it bas turned from running north and east to the opposite courses, but the great basins of the Hudson are still receiving great flood volumes, and there is still flood current above Thirty 11inth street. XL-Eleven hours after the southing of the moon it is high water at the head of Haverstraw Bay, or not far above that, and at the western end of Long Island ~found. At this hour we are presented with a remarkable, but not unfamiliar, instance of slack water (at Thirty-ninth street, Hudson River), near time of greatest surface slope. One has but to reYert to the illustration of the pendulum to see why tllis must occur at some point (or even at numerous points successively) in a deep and Jong tidal avenue. The East River current moves down its sloJle under the immediate action of gravity; not so the Hudson. Appended are three sketclles indicating the actual slopes of the Hudson for each hour after the transit of the moon. In these sketches the zero of the Governor's Island gauge of 1886 is the da.tum.

No. 16.-1887.

A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF GEODESY.
By J. HO-WARD GORE, B. S., Ph. D.

INTRODUCTION. .Although the restricted popular demand for a work peculiarly designed for the uses of the student and scientist rarely induces its author or compiler to forego its preparation, it is nevertheless likely to be a matter of serious consi<leration in connection with the question of publication b;f" private enterprise. It is especially the case that, beyond the gratification of his own scientific tastes and the undemonstrative approbation of the worthy few who appreciate the value of appliances which lessen the labor of learning, the compiler of so complete an'l exbanstiYe a Bibliography of Geodesy as that of Professor Gore can have had little to inspire his zeal and sustain his prolonged labor in an undertaking which, at the outset, involved the thorough exploration, in person, of thirty-four of the principal libraries of America and Europe, the exploration of the minor libraries by proxy, and, in addition, a searching inquiry by correspondence with all the geodesists or mathematicians of both continents. That Professor Gore bas not lacked, during the preparation of bis work, such inspiration as was derivable from the approbation of the competent, is attested by the courteous action of Colonel Herschel, R. E., in placing at the Professor's iwn·ice his own manuscript contribution to Pendulum Bibliography, as well as by the generous overtures from various institutions, among them being the International Geodetic Association at Berlin, offering to undertake the publication of his book-a most gratifying recognition of his fitness for the work and of its anticipated value. The propriety of the reason, assigned in his preface, for declining to place the publication of his book in foreign hands, will hardly be disputed by any save those who are indifferent to the just fame of American scientists and to the continued honorable identification of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey with the best work, and the successful promotion of the highest interests, of Geodesy. My own conviction of the propriety of Professor Gore's attitude was so clear tha,t I could not, without a conscious disregard of duty, haYe declined the proffer of his nrnnuscript to this Survey, for preservation and publication among the scientific .Appendices to its .Annual Rermt, and so assuring, without cost for preparation or compilation, appropriate association of the recognized American Bureaa. of Geodesy with a complete Bibliography of Geodesy, American in inception and authorship and the first work of its kind.

PREF.A.CE.
The reason for the preparation of this work was the need of it felt by the compiler. He began in 1885 a History of Geodesy, but Lefox· proceeding far it was found very difficult at auy time to be sure that the literature regarding the operations of a given period had beeu exhausted. It was at once deemetl best t-0 collect titles as well as the workR themselves. The excellent library facilities in the various technical departmeuts in Washington emphasized the feasibility of such an undertaking. The number of titles collected for this purpose onl~-, so far exceeded the special lists as given in the various bibliographies of mathematics that many persons suggested an extension of the original plan, so as to make the compilation useful to others. In response to this proposition the various libraries in Washington were carefully searched, and during two trips to Europe nearly every library facility there has been exhausted. In order to procure titles of such recent works of living authors as might escape notice, owing to delay in obtaining a place in the library catalogues, a circular letter was sent to every mathematician whose address could be obtained. Each circular had appended to it the titles of all of the known works of the recipient, with a request that omissions be supplied. This alone was the labor of several months, but was fully repaid in the gratifying assurances from many that nothing could be added, as well as in the few additional titles which tend towards making this work complete. Special effort has been made to examine carefully catalogues of libraries, however small, bibliographies of the exact sciences, hiogTaphies of mathematicians, and trade lists of antiquarian books, in addition to such well-known sources as the "Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific Papers," Reuss, "Repertoriurn," etc. A most opportune assistauc:e was furnished by Col. John Herschel, R. E., who, through the courtesy of the Ro;yal Society, and witl1 the consent of the India Office, sent a manuscript supplement to his contribution to pendulum bibliography, which was published in "Operations of the Great Tl'igonometrical Survey of India," Vol. v. From this veritable treasure seventy-two new titles were foun<l, each in the body of this work followed IJy (H). l\Iost cordial thanks are due Colonel Herschel for his aid, as well as the confidence displayed in unresenedly placing such valuable material in the hand:s of another. During the progress of the. compiling, various overtures were made by institutions desiring to become the source from which the completed work should emanate, but it wa:o> deemed only proper that it should be published iu the country which witnessed its inception and fostered its growth. Therefore it is with pardonable pride that the compiler sees the results of his lahors issuing from an institution of his own country, which throughout the world is the recognized advance guard in geodetic science. In this connection thanks should be tendered Mr. F. 1\1. 'fhorn, Superintendent, and Mr. B. A. Uolonna, Assistant in Charge of Office and Topography, of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, for their energetic interest in this undertaking. The title "Bibliography" may appear as high sounding or inappropriate to a work in which all the refinements of bibliographic science are not observed. The entire collation is not always given, since a large proportion of the books have appeared in but one edition. The only well-defined purpose has been to giv'e as much of the title as will enable one desiring the book to obtain it from any library possessing it, with the minimum effort to himself and the librarian.

was also in view in preparing the abbreviations for the serial publications, which, it is hoped, may be amplified without looking for their equivalents in their alphabetical place. It is a pleasure to acknowletlge obligations to Mr. C. C. Darwin, librarian of tlrn U.S. Geological Survey, for suggestions in preparing these abbreviations. The scope of the work will easily make itself evident to the user. The intention was to include only such works as treated directly of the figure of the earth, or described operations which could be usetl in determining that figure. The only digression frolll this plan will be seen in the case of the Jlendulum, where the th coretical side is also included. This was done because of the belief that the pendulum will soon become a more important geodetic instrument, when it may be necessary to reconsider some of its theoretical features. A few treatises on surveying, bearing the word ''geodesy" or its equivalent in the title, have been inserted with a remark indicating the character of the contents. .As a rule, remarks are used simply to correct erroneous impressions which the title alone might make. The plan adopted is to use only one alphabet, in whica will be found authors, abbreviations, and subjects. Full names of the authors have been given as far as possible, but in any subsequent repetition only the initials of their Christian names are given. The title will be found repeated under the name of each co-writer or each person named in the title. A dash (-)in a title refers to the first name given, as the one who wrote the review, or about whom the article was written. This method gives, so far as entry is concerned, equal prominence to all persons named. Under the authors, their works are arranged chronologically; in the case of serials, according to the date as given to the entire volume. This will be found advantageous when it is desired to find the full title from the abbreviated form as given under a subject~ It is also believed that the insertion of an abbreviated title in the subject classification will be found helpful, as it will enable one to see at a glance if an author whose name appears under the desired subject has written upon the special theme sought for, without turning to the author catalogue. .After each book title, and after the full title of each serial publication, there appears in parentheses the name of the owner of t11e work from which the title as given was taken. Of course it does not intimate that the work in question can be found only there. vVheu a book was once found it was not again looked for. .As a rule, those accredited to European lihraries could not, at the time of trial, be found in any library in America. It is impossible to mention here the names of all who have assisted in this work. But special thanks are due Mr. Niclwlson, of the Bodlcian, Oxford; J\Ir. Fortescue, of the British Museum; Professors Helmert and Fmmster, of Berlin; Captain von Kalmar, of Vienna; Colonel Hennequin, of Brussels; the faithful assistants in tl1e libraries of America and Europe who searched for dusty books so seldom called for tllat they became lost for the time, and to those who in tbe University Library at Cambridge and the Royal Library of llunich used their holiday hours in looking for books which they alone possessed.

Additional discussion respectfog the ellipticity of the earth as determined by expPriments made with the pendulum. Phil. Mag. (Taylor), III, 18'28, 206-210. In deducing the flgnre of the earth from tbe ob..,rve<l length of the pendulum, I ba"Ve alwa~·· thought it
necessary to leave out a few of tho experiments that wel'e inconsistent with the rest. The inoonRistency is proved by comparing the pendulmn on the same parallel, or nearly on the same, when a correction muet be applif>id. If they are e:xceRRively irregular.

The two ends of the Indian arc have widely different ~nrvaturtis, which is attributed to T"arying densities, as shown by mnrine fossils, in high oltitndes, ind!· eating great upheavals. Hence the absolute change of distance of the Janel from tile cenkr of the earth may have been wuch greater than the elevation relatively to the water.

Ignoring Laplace's instruction (1825), them bad grown a dogma that local eft'ect ahould be allowed for to the utmost 8811ignable. Jn furtheranc,e of th.is, Schubert propoM'd that the Ru8olan latitude station& should be ·pecially cont.mred, as had been done in England. The Acadtmy referred tho point to Dollen, Mlting for StruTe (ahe~nt in 8paio). Returned, Struvo indOl:oes Dollen's ad· vice. Together they lay it down that reduction for local attraction la (with eertain exceptions) only justifiable on assumptions fer which there Is onli· narily no foundation. The position is qultedllferent from Laplace's, RDd in fact quite novel :Moreover there is no alluoion to Laplace's mllng-whi<lh appears t-0 be very little kno~n this point. (H.)
