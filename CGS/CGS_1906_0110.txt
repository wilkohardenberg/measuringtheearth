REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.
THE WORK OF THE YEAR.

/

The most notable feature of the work of the year is the detennination of longitude in Alaska, along the coast and in the interior, by the telegraphic method. This was made possible by the completion of the military cable and telegraph lines in certain localities in the Territory. One of these determinations, at Eagle (Fort Egbert), is very important in connection with the marking of the international boundary along the one hundred and forty-first meridian. The transit micrometer was used for the first time by the Survey in making these detenninations and its use resulted in a very considerable reduction in the cost of the work, as it eliminates the necessity of the bservers exchanging stations for each determination. Nickel-steel (also known as In var) tapes for the measurement of base lines were used for the first time by the Survey. This metal has been used in Europe for some years in the construction of apparatus for the measurement of base lines, and it was considered very desirable to procure tapes for use in the United States. During the y~ar for the first time it became possible to procure the metal in the desired fonn of tapes. This metal has a very small coeffic~ent of expansion. It is softer than ·steel and requires a larger reel upon which to be 'wound to avoid danger of a permanent change in length. The nickel-steel tapes were thoroly standardized at the Bureau of Standards before being sent to the field and then tested in the field, on a comparator, under the conditions eKisting in the actual measurement of base lines. The length of the comparator used in this work was obtained from several measurements made with the iced-bar. Four so-meter steel tapes were standardized and four so-meter nickelsteel tapes were tested on the comparator by measurements made within a short period before or after an iced-bar measurement. Each base line was measured twice in the daytime, using three nickel-steel tapes, and twice at night, using three steel tapes. Each tape was used in measuring two-thirds of the length of each base line in order to provide for an intercomparison of the tapes. The results obtained when using the nickel-steel tapes in daylight were uniformly better than those given by the measures with steel tapes at night. When steel tapes are u·sed it is necessary, tho inconvenient, to make all measurements at night on account of the difficulty of obtaining the temperature of the tape with sufficient accuracy in daylight. The use of nickel-steel in the measurement of base lines is a decided advance in the method of obtaining the results desired, as it gives these results at reduced cost without loss of accuracy and does away with the necessity of standardizing the tapes in the field with the iced-bar. The field work undertaken by the United States in opening and remonumenting

the inte~ational boundary between the United States and Canada west of the Rocky Mountains was practically completed, under the direction of the Secretary of State, as authorized by the Din:;ctor of the United States Geological Survey and myself as Commissioners on the part of the United States. The examination of the international boundary between the States of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine and the Dominion of CaHada was completed from a point ro miles west of Richford, Vt., to St. Croix River, and a survey was made to relocate that portion of said boundary line lying between Beebe Plain and Derby Line, Vt. This work was requested by the Secretary of State for the benefit of the Secretary of the Treasury in enforcing the revenue laws. The tracing and marking of the boundary line between Alaska and Canada, as laid down by the Alaska Boundary Tribunal, was continued by me as Cominissioner on the p~rt of the United States, acting under the direction of the Secretary of State. On the Unuk River the coast triangulation was extended to the boundary, and the geographic positions of five of the peaks on the boundary line were detennined. Six permanent monuments were placed in position on the boundary. On the Chilkat River the coast triangulation was extended to the boundary, and the geographic positions of several peaks on the boundary were determined, and five. permanent monuments were placed in position on the boundary. In the vicinity of Skagway the line was marked across the valley of the main Skagway River, and several of the peaks on the boundary were connected with the triangulation, and their geographic positions were determined. Six permanent monmi1ents were placed in position, four of these being used to mark the line in the vicinity of White Pass. The work ·was in progress at the close of the year. · Geographic positions of aids to navigation not previously determined were obtainetl, and numerous dangers to na~gation were located. These operations extended along the coasts of Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode !~land, New York, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina! and Florida. · Hydrographic surveys were made in the Hudson River, Chesapeake Bay, Potomac River, Ocracoke Inlet, off Key West, and along the coast of Louisiana. · The topographic resurvey of Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River was continued and was in progress at the close of the year. The triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian was c;onipleted to the United States and Mexican boundary on the south and was connected with the Lake Survey triangulation at Duluth, Minn. The extension of this triangulation northward from the vicinity of Fergus Falls, Minn., was in progress at the close of the year. The triangulation along the Pacific coast was extended southward from Tacoma, Wash., and was nearly completed at the close of the year. Base lines were measured in the vicinity of Point Isabel, Texas; in the Willamette Valley, Oregon; near Tacoma, Wash.; near Stephen, Minn., and in South Dakota, near Brown Valley. Astronomic observations to determine latitude and azimuth were made in Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, Missotui, and Texas. The longitudes of Point Isabel, Texas; Mount Wilson, California; and of Sitka, Valdes, Seward, and Eagle (Fort Egbert), Alaska, were determined by telegraphic method by means of the military cables and telegraph lines connecting these places.

The standard levels were extended from Smithville to Galveston in Texas, thus furnishing a second connection of the level net of the United States with the Gulf of Mexico. The levels wen~ also extended from Evansville, Minn., to Stephen Base Line; from San Diego to Barstow in California, and the concluding link of the large levelcircuit, Sioux City-Kansas City-St. Louis-St. Paul-St. Cloud-Watertown-Sioux City, was completed. The Magnetic Survey of the country was continued by making observations at 382' stations in 43 States and Territories and in 2 foreign countries. Magnetic observations were also made at 45 stations in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and in the Gulf of Mexico. Continuous records were obtained during the year at.the magnetic observatories maintained at Cheltenham, Md.; Baldwin, Kans.; Sitka, Alaska; Honolulu, Hawaii; and Vieques, P. R. At these observatories the international program of rapid registration on the rst and 15th of each month was carried out, .and special observations were made during the solar eclipse of August 30, 1905. Special observations.were also made during the eclipse by the parties in the field. Numerous earthquake shocks were recorded on the seismographs ju operation at the observatories, and many such shocks were also recorded by the magnetographs. The trigonometric survey of the Government reservati9n at fort Stanton, N. Mex., used as a sanatorium by the Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service, was completed, the 64 con1ers in the boundary were marked, and numerous range posts .between these corners were placed in position. Work at the latitude observatories at Gaithersburg, Md., and Ukiah, Cal., maintained by the International Geodetic Association under niy direction, was continued .. At the request of the Navy Department several speed-trial courses along the coast were examiued and put in order. The Survey maintained an exhibit at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition at Portland, Oreg., as a portion of the exhibit of the Department of Commerce and Labor, from July r to the close of the exposition. An officer of the Survey continuec! on duty as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, as required by law, devoting as much of his time as necessary to the work of the Commission.
ALASKA.

In Alaska, surveys, including triangulation, topography, and hydrography, were made in Prince William Sound, Resurrection Bay, Kasaan Bay, McKenzie Inlet and approaches, Lyman Anchq,rage, and Lake Bay. The rapid economic development which is taking place in widely separated localities of the Alaskan coast has necessitated special efforts on the part of thF. Survey to meet the immediate demands made upon it for information. Thus a survey was urgently required for Resurrection Bay, the terminal of the' Alaskatt Central Railway and of the United States cable. As stated in my previous report, surveying vessels were dispatched to assi~t· the War Department in selecting the best route for the cable. The necessary surveys. were completed by the time the cable ship Burnside arrived in Prince William Sound. In addition to furnishing the data, an officer was assigned to the ship to guide her in laying the cable over the exact route shown to be most favorable by the hydrographic developments made by officers of the Survey. The officers of the Signal Corps of the Army, under whose direction the cable was laid, exprest their high appreciation of the services rendered.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

I906.

The geographic positions of Lincoln Rock Light-house and several dangers to navigation in Lynn Canal were determined. Work was in progress at the close of the year in the approaches to Prince William Sound, Controller Bay, and Kasaan Bay. The longitude and magnetic work in Alaska and the extension of the demarcation of the Alaska-Canada boundary have been referred to above.
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

In the Philippine Islands the following field work was done: Luzon, Manila to Dagupan.-The triangulation connecting these two places was completed and a base line was measured on the shore of Lingayen Gulf. Surveys were made on the west coast in the vicinity of Santa Cruz, Iba, Subic, Balayan, and Lucena, and in Verde Island Passage, on the east coast in Maqueda Channel, as far north as the north end of Catanduanes Island, including a survey of Pandan Bay, and hydrographic work off the south end of Catanduanes Island. · Surveys were also made in Mindoro, on the north coast, in the vicinity of Calapan; in Samar, on the east coast, in the vicinity of Laoang and at Davao; in Panay, on the south, west, and north coasts, and in the vicinity of San Jose and Iloilo; in Negros, on the west coast, in the vicinity of Bacolod; in Leyte, on the west coast, from Villaba to Ormoc, and surveys were made of Palompon Harbor, Dupon Bay, and Mattang Bay; in Mi1zdanao, on the south coast in the vicinity of Malabaug. Office work.-The results of the field work were revised and 18 new· charts were prepared for publication at the suboffice in Manila and published at the Office in Washington. The sailing directions were kept up to date as nearly as practicable by issuing supplements covering several sections. New edition& covering three sections were prepared. The new edition of Section I of the sailing directions and a catalog of charts were published. Two vessels, the Romblon and the /l:farinduque, were transferred to the Coast and Geodetic Survey by the Philippine Commission, to be used in making surveys of the coasts and waters of the archipelago. In connection with the survey of the Philippine Islands, I desire to call attention to the fact that the work has been done in the past at the joint expense of the General Government and the insular government, under an agreement approved by the Secret~ry of the Treasury and _the Philippine Commission, in 1901, and that the expenses of the work have been divided since January r, 1902, in accordance with this agreement. In 1905 the Philippine Coiumission recommended in their repprt that the whole expense of the survey of the archipelago should be borne by the National Government, and this recommendation was approved by the Secretary of War. As suggested by him, an estimate of the appropriation necessary for this purpose was prepared for transf!lission to Congress. · ' The necessity of having accurate charts of the waters of the Philippine Archipelago appeals directly to the nation, as the safety of the Navy and of all vessels engaged in commerce in these waters depends upon the possession of such charts.
PORTO RICO.

The hydrographic survey off the south coast of the island of Porto Rico was continued, the soundings being extended to the 2 ooo-fathom curve.

TIDE OBSERVATIONS.

Self-registering tide gages were maintained at Fort Hamilton, N. Y.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Baltimore, Md.; Fernandina, Fla.; Weeks, La.; Galveston, Tex.; San Diego, Cal.; Presidio, Cal.; Seattle, Wash.; Honolulu, Hawaii; and Manila and Iloilo, P. I. The tide indicators at Fort Hamilton, N. Y.; Reedy Island, Delaware River, Delaware; and Alcatraz Island, San Francisco Bay, California, have been continued, and the electric tide indicators in the rooms of the Maritime Association of New York and in the Bourse Building in Philadelphia haye given satisfaction.
OFFICl' WORK.

In the Office the current work was kept up to date and satisfactory progress was made in the various branches of the work, iiicluding computation, reduction, plotting, and discussion of results of field work and the preparation of the data for publication by chart or otherwise. The demand for data from the archives of the Survey continues to increase with the growth of the country. This is a most gratifying proof of the usefulness of the work. The results of field work are prepared for publication as rapidly as practicable for the purpose of distributing the data in the published form instead of furnishing information copied by hand. The computation of the heights from the leveling observations made during the year was completed. Gratifying progress was made. in the reduction of the triangulation in California north of Monterey Bay to the United States Standard Datum, and the preparation of this work for publication was almost completed. In this connection it should be stated that strong evidence has been presented by the California Earthquake Commission of a horizontal displacement of the earth's crust resulting from the earthquake. As such a displacement would seriously affect the coordinates of the triangulation, it has been deemed necessary to test at once the correctness of the positions assigned to the triangulation points by the computation, and orders have accordingly been issued for this purpose. The introduction of telegraphic longitude into Alaska by the detennination of the positions of Sitka, Valdez, Seward, and Eagle was made and the computation of the triangulation in Prince William Sound and vicinity was revised to adjust it to the new position of Valdez, which is three minutes of arc (or I~ miles) west of the position hitherto tentatively assumed. The computations connected with the investigations of the figure of the earth which were begun several years ago were practically completed, and it is believed that the result of this work is a definite advance in the method of dealing with this problem and that it has increased the accuracy with which the figure of the earth is determined. ' The results of magnetic observations made on land and sea during the year have been revised and prepared for publication in my Annual Report. The discussion of the work of the magnetic observatories has progressed sufficiently to permit the completion of the reduction of most of the special observations made at the request of the German Government in cooperation with the German Antarctic Expedition of r902-3, and the results have been forwarded to the State Department for transmission to the German Government. Copies of the magnetograms for certain specified days from October,

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1go6.

1902, to March, 1903, together with the necessary explanatory data, have been prepared and forwarded to Prof. Kr. Birkeland, of the University of Christiania, Norway, for use in connection with "his study of the relatiou of terrestrial magnetism to northern lights and allied phenoinena. Sufficient material is now on hand for the construction of a new set of magnetic charts for the United States and Alaska. A new discussion of the secular change of the magnetic 'declination and the reduction of all observations of declination to the same epoch, January 1, 1905, have been completed. The compilation of earthquakes recorded by the seismographs at the various magnetic observatories has been kept up to date and a special study was made of the San Francisco earthquake record to determine the existence· of magnetic effects. Tide Tables containing the predicted tides for numerous ports on the coasts of the United States and in foreign countries for the year 1907 were pre~ared for publication. Copies of the predicted tides for Astoria, Oreg., and Sitka, Alaska, were furnished in advance of publication to the Canadian.govenunent in response to a request from the authorities, and similar information relative to Wellington and Auckland, New Zealand, was furnished to the New Zealand authorities upon their request. Nineteen drawings for new charts were completed and a large number of drawings were changed to show present conditions. The work of engraving was principally confined to making necessary changes in existing plat~s to bring them up to date. The work of printing charts from copper plates was facilitated by installing individual motors for each press and the lithographing plant was extended so that all charts issued in this form are now printed by the Survey instead of by contract with private parties. A process of etching copper plates from transfers of drawings to the plates is being tried and six charts have been etched in this way with success. The Annual Report of the Survey to Congress for 1905 was prepared for printing and sent to the printer on September l, 1905, and it was available for distribution on December 28, 1905. . Some of the results of observations made in the progress of the work during that year were published in three appendixes, covering the magnetic, leveling, and triangulation wdrk of the Survey. One appendix describes a long wire sweep devised and used to discover dangers to navigation in bays and other large bodies of water, and another describes the method used in making topographic surveys, with illustrations of the various signs employed in the work. The amount appropriated for the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year 1906 was $876 975 (exclusive of the appropria.tion for printing), of which $210 245 was for manning the vessels of the Survey, $54 600 for repairs and maintenance of vessels, and $so ooo for office expenses. The remainder of the appropriation was about equally divided between expenses of parties in the field and salaries of field and office forces. In addition to the above sums the appropriations for marking the boundary between the United States and Canada west of the Rocky Mountains and for locating and marking the Alaska Boundary, made to be expended under the direction of the Secretary of State, are disbursed under my direction as Commissioner by the Disbursing Agent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey as special disbursing officer for the State Department.

L. A.
BAURR,

Inspector.

The instructions for magnetic work were prepared and the information required by the various parties engaged in field work was furnished by the Inspector. He inspected the field work in Montana and the observatory work at Cheltenham, Md., and examined the new forms of instruments, appliances; and methods devised for the determination of the magnetic elements at sea on board the yacht Galilee, chartered by the Carnegie Institution of Washington for the magnetic survey of the Pacific Ocean. The activity of the Survey in magnetic work may be summarized as follows:
OBSERVATORY WORK.

The magnetic observatories at Cheltenham, Md.; Baldwin, Kans.; Honolulu, Hawaii; Sitka, Alaska; and Vieques, P. R., were kept in continuous operation and observations were obtained with a self-registering piagnetograph and a seismograph at each observatory. At Cheltenham. two magnetographs were in use and the extreme

sensitiveness maintained on the Eschenha:gen magnetograph led to the detection of a slight magnetic disturbance directly traceable to an electric railway from I 2 to 14 miles distant. Numerous instruments were standardized, including two magnetometers which were used by the United States Navy eclipse expedition to Spain. A report on the San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906 1 was prepared from the records made by the seismographs and magnetographs at the Coast and Geodetic Survey observatories.

OFFICE OF DISBURSING AGENT.
Sco'l"t NESBIT, Disbursing Agent.

The disbursement of the funds of the Coast and Geodetic Survey is made not only by payments directly from the Disbursing Agent, but also largely thru the medium of the Assistants and other officers when acting as chiefs of parties. These officers, on approval of the Superintendent, receive advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent in lump sums, under authority of an Executive order, dated March 26, 1886. In conformity to this order there are now 7 r officers of this Service bonded in the sum of $2 ooo to $10 ooo each. When acting as chiefs of parties, these officers receive from time to time such advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent as are required,to meet the necessary current expenses of the work in hand. A ledger account is kept in the office of the Disbursing Agent .with each chief of party receiving an advance, each one being charged with all advances made to him, and, on the other hand, receiving credit for all proper expenditures made by him when presented on regularly supported vouchers after such accom{ts have been audited in the office of the Disbursing Agent and found to be correct. All of these accounts, with their supporting vouchers, are then sent thru. the Department of Commerce and Labor to the Auditor for the State and other Departments for examination and audit by him. This system has met the needs of this Service, and results in the main in economy and good order in its expenditures. In addition to the regular appropriations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Disbursing Agent also disburses the appropriations for the survey and marking of the boundary between the United States and Canada and the boundary between Alaska and Canada. During the year additional appropriations were made under these items of $20 ooo and $25 ooo, respectively.

The pipe drag was placed in position, and on August 3 and 4 a search was made for a rock which had been reported as off Munroes Island, but it was not found. The position of Pendletons Cove on the east shore of Long Island in Penobscot Bay was determined, and two uncharted ledges in the vicinity of Bay Ledge spindle off Isle au Haut were located. The vessel then proceeded to the north end of Eggemoggin Reach, and a number of hydrographic signals were erected and located with the plane table. The work mentioned above was done under the direction of Assistant L. H. Westdahl, temporarily in command of the Explorer. ·On August 28 Assistant Faris assumed command of the ship, and on the 31st he began the work of examining with the channel drag various shoal spots in East Penobscot Bay, Eggemoggin Reach, Jericho Bay, and Blue Hill Bay. The work . continued until October 16, when it was closed for the season. In making the examinations the channel drag was used wherever there was sufficient sea room in which to handle the ship. When the shoal spots were so close to the shore that the ship - could not be used over them, the examination was made by running sounding lines close together, using a launch. While working with the drag, soundings were made as usual in hydrographic work. The shoal spots examined were distributed over a wide area, and considerable time was required for the location of the necessary hydrographic signals. During the progress of this work the geographic positions of a number of aids to navigation were determined. ' ' Magnetic observations were made on shore at Rockland, in Penobscot Bay, on Nantucket Shoals, in Chesapeake Bay, and on shore at Baltimore. The vessel reached Baltimore on November 6.

The hydrographic examination of the Hudson River above Fort Montgomery was· assigned to Assistant Boutelle, and he began work at Cold Spring, N. Y., on July 11. General preparations were made, and on the r8th the charge of the work was transferred to Aid J. B. Miller. A thoro survey was not attempted, but all shoals indicated on the charts were examined by making soundings close together over their entire area. The shore line was corrected to show its present position as far north as Crum Elbow. Between Milton Landing and Esopus Light very few of the old triangulation stations were recovered. Forty-one new stations were established and their geographic positions determined. A self-registering tide gage was used at Poughkeepsie during fifty-six days, and tide staffs were erected at four other stations. The elevations of hench marks along the river had already been determined, and these gages were connected with each other )Jy leveling from each gage to the nearest bench mark. ·

TO NAVIGATION.

The tide indicator at Fort Hamilton, N. Y., was changed so that its operation will be continuous even when the surface water is frozen. An iron float tube was erected of the propt!r diameter and of such length as to permit its being filled with enough coal oil to cover the extreme range of the tide without danger of loss thru the opening which establishes communication between the water outside and ·inside the tube. The lower end of the tube was closed and it was sunk 7 feet into the ground. A small pipe enters the side of the tube about r ~ feet above the bottom of the water outside the tube and passes downward to a p<>int a few inches above the lower end of the tube so that the column of coal oil can sink below the bottom of the water outside without allowing any of it to ·escape. This solution of the problem was suggested by Mr. E. G. Fischer.

The indicator was also remodeled, the work being done in the carpenter shop at the Office, and one of the carpenters was sent from the Office to erect the new indicator. In response to a request from the Light-House Board the position selected for a new range light for Ambtose Channel, New York Bay, was located by anchoring a spar buoy near the point selected. The position of this buoy was then determined by angles from three adjacent triangulation stations which gave the data required to place the buoy in the desired position. The buoy was moved and the information was furnished to the Light-House Board. Some work was done in connection with the improvement of the speed trial courses at Rockland, Me., and Provincetown, Mass., as requested by the Navy Department. In May the position of Emerald Rock off New Rochelle, N. Y., was determined and a number of soundings were made i:n its vicinity. By the courtesy of the Light-House Board the tender Rodgers was used in doing this work and a leadsman and boat's crew were furnished by Captain Hawkins.

D. B. Wainwright.

In response to a request from the Navy Department for the determination of the length of the speed-trial course off Monroe Island, Maine, Assistant Wainwright was instructed to make the determination. He measured a short base line from which he extended a.triangulation to include the beacons marking the speed-trial course and two points in the old triangulation in this vicinity, Owls Head Light-house and Shag Rock Beacon. The distance between these two points was used as a check on the work and it agreed with the distance computed from the measured base.

The work at the Magnetic Obsen·atory at Cheltenham, Md., was continued during the year under the direction of Magnetic Observer Wallis. Two sets of self-recording magnetographs were in successful use and an almost continuous record of the relative changes in the magnetic declination, horizontal and vertical intensity was obtained. Observations were made once a week to ·determine the absolute value of the elements of terrestrial magnetism and special observations were made on the 1st and 15th of each month,in accordance with au international program. A satisfactory record was made by the seismograph. From December 1, 1904, to December 3r, 1905, thirty-one earthquakes were recorded. Some of these were records of mere tremors, but some showed the far-reaching effects of great shocks in other portions of the globe, such as the disastrous earthquakes that occurred in India in April, 1905, and in southern Italy in September of the same year. None of the earthquakes recorded were felt by persons in the vicinity of Cheltenham, but 'nine of them affected the record with Eschenhagen magnetograph. From January I to June 30 eighteen earthquakes were recorded. Two of these, one on January 31 and one on April 18 (San Francisco earthquake), produced the greatest disturbances recorded since the instruments were installed. Five of the earthquakes produced a distinct disturbance of the magnetograph magnets. Observations were made to standardize various instruments, among them the magnetometers used by the United States Navy eclipse expedition.

Hydrographic examinations on the coast of Maine and magnetic observations on land and at sea were assigned to Assistant Welker, commanding the steamer Bache. Magnetic observations were made on shore at Baltimore and the vessel sailed for Bar Harbor, Me., on August 20. Magnetic observations were again made in Hampton Roads and deep-sea soundings were made off the entrance to New York Bay, beginning at a point 130 miles to the southeast and continuing for·a distance of 220 miles, where the work was suspended on account of stormy. weather. While in Newport Harbor, Rhode Island, storm bound, a reported rock was located. The deep-sea sou~ding was resumed on September 8 and completed next day.· The vessel r~ached the coast of Maine on September 16 and the hydrographic work mentioned below was completed before the close of the season on October 28. This work consisted of special hydrographic .examinations in certain localities, searching for reported uncharted rocks with the channel sweep in position, resurveys of bars, and the development of localities where uncharted rocks were suspected. A survey was made in the vicinity of the 4-fathom spot in Salisbury Cove, Eastern Bay, and a number of uncharted rocks were located. The northern part of Eastern Bay in the vicinity of Googin's ledge was examined. Sunken Ledge, near black buoy· No. 9, at the entrance to Eastern Bay, was examined and a least depth of 4 feet was found over the rock. Surveys were made of Calf Island Bar and of Jordans Bar, which showed changes in Calf Island Bar and located numerous uncharted rocks in the vicinity of Jordans Bar. Certain portions of Frenchmans Bay were examined with the channel sweep in position. Magnetic observations were made at an old station on Bear Island and on board ship in the vicinity. ' Early in October the vessel proceeded to Southwest Harbor. The approaches to the harbor, from East Bunkers Ledge to Bear Island Light-house, were thoroly examined with the channel sweep. The region in the vicinity of Old Tom and the approaches to Southwest Harbor, between Sutton Island and Cranberry Island, was also examined with the channel sweep, and a number of uncharted rocks were discovered and located. A.survey was made of the passage between Bear Island and Mou~t Desert Island and of the entrance to Cranberry Island Passage, in the Vicinity of buoys Nos. 2 and 3. Shoal water having been reported between Little .Gott Island and Black Island, this passage was carefully examined with the channel sweep, but no. such shoal was found.

Hydrographic work along the Atlantic coast and at Key West, Fla., and magnetic observations in the Gulf of Mexico were assigned to Assistant Welker, commanding the steamer Bache. Early in January magnetic observations were again made at Baltimore and the vessel sailed for Key West on January 16. · Magnetic observations were made in Hampton Roads and at sea over a prescribed route leading from Diamond Shoals Light-vessel~cross the Gulf Stream to the eastern end of Great Abaco Island, thence along the eastern end of the island, thru the Northwest Providence Channel, across the Gulf Stream, and alon:g the Florida Reefs thru the main ship channel to Key West, where observations were made in the harbor and on shore. On February IO the work of examining the southeast and western channels in the approaches to Key West began and was continued until April 2, when this work was temporarily suspended. Magnetic observations were made on board ship and the vessel made a trip to Galveston, Tex. Seven sets of magnetic observations were made en route to Galveston and seven sets on the return voyage, also one set near the entrance to Galveston Harbor, one set on shore at Galveston, one set in the lower harbor, one set in the harbor at Key West, and the series ended with o·e set on shore at Key ·West. On May 9 the vessel sailed for Brunswick, Ga., and made one set of magnetic observations en route. A search was made for a shoal reported as existing 40 miles to the eastward of St. Simons Sound. One ·hundred and sixty miles of lines were run with a submarine sentry set at a depth of 8 fathoms, with soundings made every thirty minutes covering the location of the supposed shoal, but the reported shoal was not found. The vessel reached Southport, N. C., on May 28, and the positions of Frying Pan Shoals Lightship, of the whistling buoy 9 miles to the eastward, and of the outer limits of the shoal were determined. On June 6 the vessel sailed for Baltimore and reached there on June 9.

On July I the Endeavor was at work at the mouth of the Potomac River. Tide observations were made at Holland Island Bar Light-house and at Point Lookout. The geographic position of the new light-house at Point No Point was determined and the hydrographic work at the mouth of the Potomac River was completed on July 7. · On July 14 a hydrographic examination of the ocean off Cape Henry was begun and continued whenever the weather and other conditions permitted until November 24. Lines of soundings 3 miles apart were run over' the area to be examined, the positions of the ship being determined from time to time by sextant angles taken on the ship on objects on shore or by observations on the ship made with theodolites from stations on shore. Two signals were anchored 8 miles offshore on account of the difficulty of seeing the signals on shore, and these were used until they were carried away by heavy seas in October. After they were destroyed two observers with theodolites were sent on shore and the position of the ship was determined at certain times, as stated above. The ship was at Norfolk having repairs made to the boiler during the greater part of October. Tide observations were made at Old Point Comfort and in Lynn-haven Inlet. On November 28 the Endeavor proceeded to Colonial Beach, and an examination with the channel sweep was made in the vicinity of a proposed channel on the north side of the Kettle Bottom Shoals. This ·work was completed, and the vessel sailed for Baltimore on December 10.

W. B. Fairfield.

18 stations occupied.
54 geographic positions determined.

Triangulation work on the coast of Texas was assigned to Assistant Fairfield. He went to Matagorda on January 28 to determine the geographic position of the lighthouse at that place. Six old triangulation stations were recovered and the triangulation was carried along the whole length of the bay, thru seven quadrilaterals to Matagorda Light-house. The shore line of the bay has changed materially since the survey ,yas made, fifty years ago, and most of the old stations have been destroyed. In I903 the Fish Commission did some triangulation work in the bay in connection with a survey of the oyster beds, and many of the signals used were found standing. These were connected with the new work, and all of them were marked irt tile same \vay as the stations of the regular work. A small oyster sloop was used· for quarters and as the means of transportation, and heavy winds (northers) seriously delayed the work in February and March. During April and May fresh winds from the southeast and fog also delayed the work. The work was completed ot1 May x4, and Mr. Fairfield went to Sabine Pass to determine the geographic position of Sabine Bank Light-house. This light is I 8 % miles southeast of Sabine Pass Light-house and farthe~ than this from any available triangulation stations along the coast. Two old triangulation stations were recovered south of Sabine Pass. An observing tower 50 feet high was erected at one of these stations and a high pole at the other, but it was so difficult to observe on the light that the attempt was finally abandoned. Another high pole was then erected over the tower, and observations were made from the Sabine Bank Lighthouse and Sabine Pass Light-house, and the desired position was determined in tliat way. Dense smoke and various other causes delayed the work, and' it was in progress on June 30.

Base measurement: 3 base lines measured. Triangulation: 50 square miles area covered. 6 stations occupied. 6 geographic positions determined.

The work of ·measuring one base line in Texas, one in Minnesota, and one in South Dakota was assigned to Assistant French. The base line at Point Isabel, Tex., was prepared and the measurement began on March 25. A comparator 50 meters long was established and four double measures of it with the iced-bar were made during the time required to standardize the steel tapes. Four 50-meter steel tapes were standardized and four 50-meter nickel-steel tapes were tested on the comparator by measurements made within a short period before or after an iced-bar measure. In this way the steel tapes were standardized under practically the same conditions involved in their use in the field. The base line was measured twice in the daytime, using three. nickel~steel tapes, and twice· at night, using three steel tapes, and these measurements were all made in

light wind, as windy weather prevails in this region. Observations were made at six triangulations stations to connect the base line with the triangulation. Some of this work was· done while waiting for suitable weather to complete the base measurement. The connection was completed on April I I. The observations at the triangulation stations were made at night, as the conditions for observing in the daytime were very unfavorable. The nickel-steel (Invar) tapes, recently acquired by the Survey, were used for the first time in measuring this base line. They have about the same cross section as the steel tapes (6 millimeters wide and 0.5 millimeter thick), and they were used in daylight in the same way as the steel tapes were used at ni'ght. After completing the work in Texas, base measurement was suspended in the Middle Division until June 13, and during this interval two base lines were measured in the Western Division. The work was resumed at Stephen, Minn., on June 13, where the base line had been prepared in advance. The measurement was made between June -16 and 22, and next day the party started to the Brown Valley base in South Dakota. The measurement of this base line was begun on June 25 and wascompleted on June 30. Both these bases were measured twice in the daytime with nickel-steel tapes (using three tapes) and twice at night with steel tapes (using three tapes). Each tape was used in measuring two-thirds of the length of each base, in order to provide for an intercomparison of the tapes. The results obtained when using the nickel-steel tapes in daylight were uniformly better than those given by the measures with steel' tapes at night, and the use of nickel-steel or invar (having a very small coefficient of expansion) for base measurement is a decided advance in the method of obtaining the results desired, as it will furnish the results at a reduced cost without loss of accuracy. The method of preparing and measuring these base lines with tapes is fully described in Appendix 3, Report for 19oi.

of Carlton triangulation stations was determined by leveling to .the station from a bench mark previously established in the town of the same name.. The observing towers at the triangulation stations were built by separate party in advance of the date on which they could be occupied for observations. This portion of the work was completed on August 26, and the signalman was sent to Texas to erect observing towers on the extension of the triangulation to the Laguna Madre Base line, near Corpus Christi. On October 10 Mr. King closed work in Minnesota and proceeded to Texas, accompanied by his recorder. He reached Alice on the 14th and found that the observing towers, mentioned above, had been completed. Observations were begun on October 21 and completed on November 30. During this period eleven stations were occupied, extending the triangulation from the line Nolan-Elliff near Banquete to the Gulf coast at Corpus Christi Pass. This work includes the connection of the Laguna Madre Base line. ,1 In November Signalman J. S. Bilby was sent to Point Isabel, ~Texas: to select a base line and to arrange for its connection with the triangulation. He selected a base line and a station for longitude and azimuth determinations. He recovered and remarked five old triangulation stations and selected one new one. This work was completed during the period November 12-24.

A topographic survey was made of the marsh in the vicinity of Lake Pelto and Terrebonne Bay. .,. Timbalier Bay was covered by lines of soundings, and these lines were extended over certain portions of Lake Barre, Terrebonne Bay, and Lake Pelto. In Lake l?elto the hyqrographic work extends from Caillon Boca to the center of the lake, and covers the inside passage from Raccoon Point' to Grand Pass Timbalier. In Terrebonne Bay the work covers the passes into Bayou Terrebonne and Lake Barre from the bay. All these passes were found to be quite shallow. . The work closed on June 9 and the party proceeded to Oyster Bayou, ·and an.effort was made to recover some of the old triangulation stations in this vicinity, but none were found. The work closed at Oyster Bayou on June lJ.

E. H. Pagenhart.

570 kilometers of lines completed. 184 bench marks established.

The work of extending the standard levels in Minnesota and Texas was assigned to Aid Pagenhart. On July 1 he was at work in the vicinity of Dalton, Minn., and after that date the work was continued northward along the Great Northern Railway to Stephen, where the line ended at Stephen West Base on September 16. This line of levels follows the triangu!ation laid out along the ninety-eighth meridian, and branch lines were leveled from the main line to determine the elevation of seven points selected as triangulation stations. The main line determines the elevation of the base line near Stephen. Velocipede cars were not used on this work. On December 9 Mr. Pagenhart began leveling work at Smithville, Tex., and extended the levels along the Missouri, ;Kansas and Texas. Railroad to Galveston, completing the work on February IO. This line furnishes an additional connection between the levels in the interior of the country and mean sea level on the Gulf of Mexico. Velocipede cars were used on this work as the means of transportation.

Mr. Smith reached Madison on January 20, and Prof. C. E. Mendenhall placed at his disposal the room and piers in Science Hall, of the University of Wisconsin, where previous observations with pendulums had been made. Professor Corns.tock, of the Washburn Observatory, furnished the corrections to the sidereal clock used for time ·comparisons and the gravity observations were completed January 25 to 29. Austin, Tex., was used as the base for the longitude work in Texas. Mr. McGrath reached there on January 31 and recovered the astronomic station in the Capitol Grounds, which had been preserved thru the intelligent interest of the superintendent of the grounds. The station was ready for use on February 3. Mr. Smith reached Alice on February 2, but a "norther" delayed his work and the station was not ready until the 10th. Unfavorable weather delayed the observations, and the detennination of the difference of longitude, Austin-Alice, was not completed until the 24th. Mr. Smith then proceeded to J?o~nt Isabel and Mr. McGrath moved from Austin to Alice. The difference of longitude, Alice'-Point Isabel, was determined March 14 to 20, and Mr. Smith went to Austin while Mr. McGrath occupied the station at Point Isabel. The difference of longitude, Austin-Point Isabel, was determined March 29 to 31, closing" the triangle, Austin-Alice-Point Isabel,. and completing the work in Texas.

On July 1 the primary triangulation along the Pacific coast was in progress in \Vashington. Several men were kept at work in charge of a foreman, opening trails and lines and preparing stations for the observing party, until October, when this work was suspended for the season. Observations were made at all the stations in the vicinity of Tacoma, completing the connection of the base line with the triangulation, and at six stations south of the city extending the triangulation to the vicinity of Mount St. Helens. Work closed on September 29 as the result of a heavy snow storm which made it impracticable to remain in the mountains. After reaching Portland, observations were made at four stations in the vicinity of the Columbia River, and work for the season' closed on October 8. The weather was very unfavorable during the season and 'serious delay was caused . by the heavy cutting necessary in opening lines and by forest fires during a· portion of the season. In the latter part of September, Assistant Hill was sent to make a reconnaissance for triangulation to connect the primary work in the interior with the tertiary work on the shor~s of Coos Bay, Oregon. The country was examined and a satisfactory scheme was developed by the· selection of fourteeu stations. The work was completed in fifteen days. The measurement of a base line in Oregon and another in \Vashington was assigned to Assistant French. After suspending work in the Middle Division he began work on the Willamette base line at Eugene, Oreg., on April 22 and the line was prepared and all measures were completed on May 13. as favorable weather prevailed nearly all the time the work was in progress. The party then moved to Tacoma, Wash., and began work on the base line in that vicinity on May 19. The work at this base line and in this Division was completed on June 8. These base lines were measured twice in the daytime with nickel-steel tapes (using three tapes) and twice at night with steel tapes (using three tapes). Each tape was used in measuring two-thirds of the length of each base line in order to provide for an intercomparison of the tapes. The results obtained when using the nickel-steel tapes in daylight were uniformly better than those given by measures with steel tapes at night. ·The method of preparing and measuring these base lines with tapes is fully described·in Appendix 3, Report for 1901.

The determination of the longitude of certain places in Alaska was assigned to Assistants Smith and McGrath, in charge of cooperating parties. This work w~ in progress on July I and it was continued until December 2. During this period th!! observers made observations at Sitka, Valdez, and Eagle (Fort Egbert), and time signals were exchanged with an observer at Seward, who made observations at that place under Assistant Hodgkins's direction. These observations resulted in determining the telegraphic longitude of the three places mentioned, thus adding important data to the existing· geographical knowledge of the region. The station at Eagle (Fort Egbert) is quite near the international boundary line, and will be used in the final determination of the position of that line. It was necessary to occupy hagle during the summer months, and the difference of longitude Valdez-Eagle was determined during the period July 18-August 26. From August 20 to 28 time signals were exchanged between Valdez and Seward, and after August 25 between Valdez and Copper Center, the latter work being done at the request of the United States deputy land surveyor in order to determine the longitude of a certain comer in his survey. During this work Mr. Smith was at Eagle and Mr. McGrath at Valdez. The work at Eagle included observations with pendulums to determine the force of gravity, observations to determine latitude, and magnetic observations. A short base line was measured and the positions of several objects were determined by triangulation and connected with the astronomic station, one of these being Eagle Peak. The azimuth of a meridian mark placed on Eagle Peak was deduced from the time observa~ tions made to determine the longitude. In his report Assistant Smith expresses his appreciation of the courtesy with which he was received by the officers of the military post at Fort Egbert, and states that Maj. E. H. Plummer, the commanding officer, rendered valuable assistance m the work by assigning quarters to the observer, by giving permission to use the cellar under the quarters for the gravity observations, by sending a party to erect the azimuth mark, and by personal assistance at the transit. Mr. Smith left Eagle on August 28 and reached Sitka on September 7. Unfavorable weather caused serious delay, and the necessary observations to determine the difference of longitude between Sitka and Valdez were not completed until November 25, and the work closed on December r. During this interval observations were 11.iade at Valdez to determine the latitude and the elements of terrestrial magnetism, and the astronomic . station was connected with the triangulation. The work closed on December 2.

The steamer Marinduque was transferred on November r, 1905, to the Coast and Geodetic Survey, for use in survey work in the Philippines, in pursuance of a resolution of ·the Philippine Commission of June 23, 1905. The vessel sailed from Manila· on December ro, 1905. after being completely outfitted for survey work. Some ~Iter ations were made to adapt the steamer for change of service, and necessary repairs were effected. The Marinduque was again at Manila from April ro to 23, 1906, docking, turning in survey results, and outfitting for another season. · During the remainder of the year the steamer has been on the working ground. The steamer Romblon was transferred at the same time and under the same arrangement as the Marinduque, and after outfitting, alterations and repairs, sailed from Manila December 14, 1905. 'fheRomblonwas at Manila from April 13 to May 13, 1906, during which time the vessel was docked, repairs and some additional alterations effected, and survey results turned in, and the steamer· outfitted for another season. During the rest of the season the steamer has been on the working ground, with the exception of a f~w days' repairs effected when coming to port for coal.
OFFICE WORK.

Under the existing plan the preliminary office work is completed at Manila, for the reason that much of it can be done to better advantage in the regions concerned than it could be so far away as Washington. The work iS done in the following Divisions: Computing, Nautical, Chart Construction, and Correspondence and Property." The Director, in addition to general supervision of these Divisions, prepares specifications for field work and for charts, and examines chart drawings and nautical information prepared for publication. CompuHng Division.-The work of this Division comprises the receipt and register of all survey records (not drawings), and the completion of.all computations necessary to put the field records in shape for chart construction or other purpose. Wltere computations are made in the field they are verified. The principal classes of comfmtations are the reduction of tidal observations and planes of reference, reduction of astronomic observations for latitude, longitude, and azimuth, reduction of all soundings to mean ower low water, computation of distances, positions and elevations from triangulation, and computation of magnetic declination. Data were prepared for the use of field parties in extending surveys, and for the use of the office in plotting hydrographic sheets and preparing charts. Nautical Division.-The following publications have been prepared and verified:
Notices to Mariners, Nos. 8 to 15 of 1905. Notices to Mariners, Nos. I to·6 of 1906. Sailing Directions, Section I, North aud West Coast of Luzon and adjacent islands, 1906 (third edition).

The above have been printed and issued with the ·exception of Sections II and VI and VII, which are in press .. This Division now also has charge of the correction'and issi.te of charts and nautical publications and of furnishing information in response to inquiries regarding charts and sailing directions. Files of charts and other :publications concerning the Philippine Islands and adjacent waters are kept as works of reference for those interested. The Manila office has this year undertaken to ,examine files of Coast and Geodetic Survey charts sent in from ships, and to make necessary corrections, or to mark charts which are canceled. During the year 23 sets of Philippine charts have been so examined. With the facilities at the office this can readily be done. In almost every set of charts sent in for examination a number'were. found i:n. use which were obsolete, having been superseded by later charts or editions. This Division has assisted in the inspection of survey steamers, the preparation of specifications for repairs, the examination of requisitions for supplies for vessels, and the filing of papers and drawings regarding the vessels. A table of distances between Philippine ports has been prepared, and measurements have been made of .the shore line of each island and .of the water area of the Islands. A systematic collection and arrangement of records and information regarding currents has. been undertaken.

On July 1 the survey of the southeastern coast of Luzon in the vicinity of Maqueda Channel was in progress under the direction of Assistant C. C. Yates, commanding the steamer Fathomer. · On August 9 the triangulation had been extended from the triangulation of Lagonoy Gulf along Maqueda Channel as far north as Palumbanes Islands and as far west as Masnou and Lunguipao islands. The topographic survey of the west coast of Catanduanes Island had been finished as far as Pandan Point, and on the coast" of Luzon from Rung us Point to a point 3 miles west of Caramuan Point. Assistant Dibrell relieved Assistant Yates of the command of the Fathomer on August 9, and continued the work in accordal1ce with the original plan. A self-registering tide gage was kept in operation in Gituma River until the middle of September, when it was moved to Tabgon Bay, a sheltered locality on the coast of Luzon west of Lunguipao Island, and kept in operation in.that place during the remainder of the season. The hydrographic survey of Maqueda Channel was completed north of Rungus Point, and was extended to cover the waters west of Catanduanes Island to a line north and south thru Lahuy Island and to a point 10 miles north of Catanduanes Island. Some hydrographic work was also done in the vicinity of Virac Point, on the south end of Catanduanes Island, including a portion of Virac Bank. A topographic survey was made of the shores of Pandan Bay and of the coast of Luzon in the vicinity of Tabgon. . The topographic survey of the islands to the eastward of Quinabugan was· completed, with the exception of t},le west· coast of· Lahuy Island. Unfavorable weather caused a suspension of the field work on November 17, on which date the vessel sailed from Tabgon ·Bay for Manila via Legaspi.

The party reached Santa Cruz on February 19. A tide gage.was erected and a number of old triangulation stations were recovered. The hydrographic work was completed during the period March 12 to May 12. The portion of Santa Cruz Harbor not previously surveyed was completed, and lines 300 meters apart were sounded over the remaining portion of the bay. The weather conditions were very favorable during the morning hours, but in the afternoon the work was often delayed and made difficult by a strong wind from the northwest.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, l9<J6.

The survey of the. western coast of Mindanao Island between Tapian and Lapitan points was assigned to Assistant Wainwright, commanding the Fa/homer. He reached Paraug on January 7. The astronomic station was recovered and a base line was measured on the east shore of Polloc Bay. The triangulation was extended from the astronomic station and the base line to the entrance of the: bay and thence across to Bongo Island and up and down the coast. Observations to determine an azimuth were made at the north end of the base. A self-registering tide gage was established on a wharf at Polloc and a record was obtained covering a period of nearly three months. A topographic survey was made within the following general limits: Lapitan Point to Tugupangan Point, Bongo Island; Timako Hill to Manangula Point; and along the northern branch of the Rio Grande of Mindanao. The hydrographic work was done within the general limits named below: Lapitan Point to Tugupangan Point; Lapitan Point to Bongo Island, vicinity of Tapian Point and Bongo Island; and Tapian Point to Manangula Point. All this work was in Illana Bay. The determination of Parang and Malabaug showed that they were located on the published charts considerably out of their tcue position. Work was discontinued on April 2 and the vessel returned to Manila. On May 4 the Fathomer sailed from Manila for the east coast of Luzon, and during the remainder of the fiscal year was at work along the coast from Lahuy Island to San Miguel Bay, extending the hydrography, topography, and triangulation.

On July 1 the Patlz.finder was at work at Hilaban Island, east coast of Samar, and the work was continued whenever the weather and other conditions permitted until September 25. On this date the vessel was driven ashore by a typhoon and severely injured, which required a return to Manila for repairs as soon as possible. Considerable delay during the season resulted from the necessity of having a military escort for the parties on shore .and from the long distance to be traveled in going to Cebu for coal and supplies. While on the way to and from Cebu additional reconnaissance work was done on the east coast of Samar. While the ship was in Cebu Harbor early in July a close examination was made of two shoal spots not shown by the former survey, and on the return voyage to the working ground a running reconnaissance was made along the north coast of Samar. The topographic work was along shore from Cahra Point to Cannomanda Point and from Bunga Point to a point 3 miles to the north. The hydrographic work was done within the limits stated below: Dolores to Cauaoid and Pasig Island, Pasig Island to Sulat Harbor, Apiton Island to Alugon Bay, and Port Libas to San Ramon. The Patti.finder reached Davao, Mindanao, on February 21, and the work of surveying the Gulf of Davao began immediately. . An astronomic station was selected and observations to determine time, latitude, and azimuth were made. The longitude was determined from Zamboanga by the chronometric method. A base line was measured and progress was made in the topographic, hydrographic, and triangulation work whenever the weather permitted until April 2, when the survey of the upper portion of the Gulf of Davao was completed. On April 3 the vessel proceeded to Casilaran Bay and landed a party to begin work while the vessel went to Zamboanga for coal. A running reconnaissance was made of the coast going to and returning from Zamboanga. The vessel reached Casilaran Bay on April 12, and on the 18th the survey of the bay and approaches was completed. Observations to determine time, latitude, and azimuth were made at Malalog. The vessel returned to Davao, making a reconnaissance of the coast on the way and taking soundings at intervals of 2 miles until the limit of the survey off Davao was reached. Work in this vicinity was resumed, and the survey of the most important portion of Pakiputan Strait was completed by April 30, and the ship sailed at once for Zamboanga, making a reconnaissance of the coast on the way. The vessel reached Hilaban Island, east coast of Samar, on May 9, and the survey of this region was resmned and continued during the remainder of the fiscal year. Surveys were made along the coast from Alugan Bay to Helm Bay, and the triangulation was extended a little beyond these limits. On June 30 the vessel was at work on the survey of Gumay Bay.

Magnetic observations were made on shore at Baltimore before starting, and observations were also made in the bay off Baltimore and off Norfolk and at sea on two days while en route to Porto Rico. At Fajardo Roads observations were made at sea and on shore, and also off the south coast of Porto Rico near Muertos Island. During the season observations were made on shore in Rincon Bay and at Port Real, Vieques Island, with the ship's dip circle and with the theodolite magnetometer. Observations were made on shore at Fajardo at the close of the season and en route to Baltimore, whenever the weather permitted, on a course about 100 miles to the eastward of the usual track, in latitude 30° N. ' The vessel reached Ponce on January 20, and on the 22d a self-registering tide gage was installed at Ponce and hydrographic signals were erected. The hydrographic work began in the vicinity of St. Isabel Landing on January 22 and was continued until May 23. The work extended along the south coast of Porto Rico from Cape Rojo to Port Ferro, Vieques Island, and included inshore and offshore (deep sea) work . .From the shore to the 100-fathom curve the unsurveyed waters between previous surveys were covered, and numerous shoals discovered in the progress of the work were developed by soundings. The 100-fathom curve was defined along the entire distance covered. The deep-sea work covers the coasts of the islands of Porto Rico and Vieques and extends offshore to an average depth of 1 800 fathoms. The work was delayed by the inferior quality of the coal obtained at San Juan and by the unusually strong trade winds that prevailed in February and May.

MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

PORTO RICO.

J. W. Green.

The work at the magnetic observatory at Vit!ques, P. R., was continued during the year without interruption. The registration of the relative force of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism was continuous except for brief periods during which it was necessary to adjust the instruments. On the 1st and 15th of each month the international program of rapid registration was carried out and, with one exception, observations were made twice each week to determine the absolute value of the declination and the horizontal and vertical intensity. The seismograph was kept in continuous operation, meteorological observations were made every day, and time observations were made once every week. Special observations were made to detem1ine the value of the declination in connection with the solar eclipse on August 30, 1905.

ALASKA BOUNDARY.

0. H. Tittmann.

The work of tracing and marking the' boundary line between Alaska and Canada, as laid down by the Alaska Boundary Tribunal, was continued by 0. H. Tittmann and W. F. King, Commissioners of the United States and Great Britain, respectively. The following work was done, as directed by the Secretary of State, under the immediate supervision of the United States Commissioner: During the season of 1905 three parties \Vere at work-one.on the Unuk River, in charge of Fremont Morse; one on the Chilkat River, under J. A. Flemer; and one at the head of Lynn Canal, under 0. M. Leland. , On the Unuk River a base line and azimuth were measured and the triangulation was extended from Bnrrouglis Bay to the boundary line. The positions of nine mountain peaks were determined, five on the north and four on the south side of the river. The positions of five boundary peak~ :were determined by triangulation: 7700, 6650, and 6450 south of the river and 6200 and 6500 north of the river. Six permanent monuments were placed in position on the boundary-one on Peak 6200, one on the slope of this peak, one on the north bank a1,1d one on the south bank

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR.VEY REPORT, 1906.

of the Unuk River, one on the crest of the first ridge south of the river, and one on the crest of a ridge 1 ~ kilometers south of the river. An area of 400 square miles was covered by phototopographic reconnaissance. Acknowledgment is made of the valuable assistance rendered by the officers of the Unuk River Mining, Smelting and Transportation Company, which made it possible to complete the triangulation from Burroughs Bay to the boundary line during the season. The triangulation on the Chilkat River was extended to the boundary where it crosses the headwaters of the river and the positions of several of the boundary peaks were detem1ined. The boundary between Peaks Nos. 48 and 49 (6850 and 6700) was indicated by stakes, and a vista was opened across the valley of the Tahini ( we~t branch of the upper Chilkat) for a distance of 2 ~ miles. Five boundary monuments were placed in position on this section, one on the east bank of the Tahini River, one on the west bank of this river, and three others at irregular intervals west of !he river, the last one being a little more than halfway between Peaks Nos. 48 and 49. One hundred and seventy square miles in the vicinity of the Chilkat River was covered with phototopographic reconnaissance. . ' In the vicinity of Skagway the line was marked across the valley of the main Skagway River between Peaks 6750 and 6600. An avenue was cut thrn the timber in this valley for a distance of 1 mile, and this vista was cleared of logs and brush. Several of the boundary peaks were connected by triangulation with the triangulation already completed on Lynn Canal, and two of these peaks, 5550 and 6750, were occupied as triangulation stations. This triangulation extends up the Taiya River to Taiya Pass. A phototopographic reconnaissance was made of the vicinity of the boundary between Peaks 5550 and 6600. Monuments were placed in position as follows: One on the north bank of the main Skagway River, one on a high bluff across the river to the southward, one on top of Peak 6750, and one on Peak 5550. The line across White Pass was marked by four monuments. The actual distance along the boundary covered by the work is about 20 miles. The completed line extends from Peak 5550, adjacent to Chilkoot Pass, across White Pass to Peak 6750. .. At the close of the year three parties were at work on the boundary-one in the vicinity of the Chilkat River, one in the vicinity of White Pass, and one in the vicinity of Yakutat Bay.

NORTHWEST BOUNDARY.

0. H. Tittmann.

On July 1 the work of re-marking the boundary line between the United States and Canada was in progress, under the direction of the Department of State, with Messrs. 0. Ji:. Tittmann, Superintendent Coast and Geodetic Survey, and C. D. Walcott, Director of the United States Geological Survey, as Commissioners representing the United States. Mr. W. F. King, Chief Astronomer of the Canadian Department of Interior, took part in this work as the Commissioner of Great Britain. Messrs. C. H. Sinclair and E. C. Barnard were assigned to the immediate charge of the work in the field, representing the United States Commissioners, and the following statement covers the work done by the parties under them during the season of 1905:

A triangulation party was organized at Gateway, Mont., about the middle of May, and after determining trigonometrically 7 boundary monuments in that section, and setting 4 monuments to complete the gap between Frozen Lakeand the West Fork of the Yaak River, it was transferred to the Rocky Mountains, where it completed the observations in the most easterly quadrilateral that carried the triangulation to the terminus of the boundary work. It then moved to the west of the Yaak River and determined 20 monument locations between that river and Porthill. These determinations were made by developing subordinate schemes from the main scheme of triangulation. Another triangulation party was organized at Loomis, Wash., June 1 and extended the work to the westward of the Skagit River, reoccupying the necessary stations of the preceding season and locating a number of boundary monuments. A monumenting party was organized at Belton, Mont., early in June, from which place it moved 50 miles north to the boundary and. set 15 monuments between the summit of the Rocky Mountains and Frozen Lake, a distance of 26.5 miles. The party then went west of the Yaak River and set 22 monuments that completed the marking from the summit of the Rocky Mountains to Porthill, a distance of 110 miles. A monument was also set a Laurier, Wash., to mark the railroad crossing. A double monumenting party was organized at Loomis, Wash., in June and set 38 monuments between the Similkameeu and. the Skagit rivers, a distance of 6r miles. The work of 1905 completed the marking of 200 miles of boundary, undertaken by the United States, by 130 aluminum-bronze monuments, set in concrete. Of the 409.5 miles of boundary between Point Roberts and the summit of the Rocky Mountains there are l l miles of water across Simiamoo Bay. A topographic party was organized at Loomis in October and completed a belt 12 miles long and 2 miles in width on the United States side of the boundary between ·the Similkameen River and Lake Osoyoos. In June a magnetic observer undertook to determine the magnetic elements along the boundary from Point Roberts to the summit of the Rocky Mountains, 409.5 miles, but on account of snowstorms he omitted the last three eastem stations. He occupied 24 stations, t.:avering 366 miles of boundary, at an average distance apart of 15.3 miles. During the month of May a leveling party was organized at Meyers Falls, Washiugton,. and carried a line of levels to the boundary at Waneta and checked. back to Meyers Falls, a distance of 90 miles. Fifteen permanent and 40 temporary bench marks were located. In September a line of levels was run from the boundary at the Pasayten River to Barron, a distance of 27.5 miles, to check the work of r904.

DETAILS OF OFFICE OPERATIONS.
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE .
. ANDREW BRAID,

Assistant i1i C/1arge.

The Assistant in Charge of the Office has direct supervision of the work of the different divisions of the Office. The Miscellaneous Section is a part of the immediate Office of the Assistant in Charge.
COMPUTING DIVISION.

The work of supplying data and other information to the parties in the field and to persons outside the Go~rernment service \vas heavier than ever before, the quantities and percentages of increase beii1g as follows: 2 096 pages of correspondence, an increaSe of I8 per cent; 3 878 geographic positions furnished, an increase of 3I per cent; and 3 l 23 descriptions of stations and bench marks prepared, an increase of 66 per cent. The average effective force of the Division, not. including the Chief, was l 3. The manuscript of two appendixes to the Annual Report for 1905 was completed and the proof was read. The computation of the observations made in the astronomic, gravity, and precise-leveling work was kept nearly up to date. Considerable progress was made in reducing the triangulation in California north of Monterey Bay to the United States Standard Datum. The computations in connection with the investigation of the figure of the earth were practically completed. It is believed that the result of these computations is a definite advance in the method of dealing with this problem. The computation of the triangulation in Prince William Sound, Alaska, was very nearly completed.
DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

The revision of the computation of the magnetic observations made by the parties in the field was kept nearly up to date. The results of observations made during the previous fiscal year were prepared for publication in the Annual Report of the Survey, Appendix 3, and the proof was read. · The discussion of the observations made at the observatories was continued. The base lines of the declination and horizontal intensity records were tabulated for the observatory at Cheltenham, Md., for 1902-5; at Honolulu, Hawaii, for 1902-5; and at Sitka, Alaska, for 1902-4. Values were adopted for the conversion of the relative observations into absolute measures which made it possible to furnish the results of the special observations on the 1st and 15th of each month made at the request of the 91

92

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1go6.

German Government in cooperation with the German Antarctic Expedition of 1902-3. The values of the declination and horizontal intensity were furnished for every twenty seconds of the specified hour during which the magnetographs were run at a rapid rate, and the values for each hour of the corresponding Greenwich mean day were also furnished. Copies of the magnetograms from the Cheltenham, Baldwin, Honolulu, and 'Sitka observatories for <:ertain specified periods between October, 1902, and March, 1903, and the data necessary to interpret the curves were sent, through the Department .of State, to Prof. Kr. Birkeland, of th~ University of Christiania, Norway, for his use in connection with his investigations of the relation of terrestrial magnetism with northern lights and allied phenomena. In this connection acknow.ledgment is maqe to the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie" Institution for the assistance rendered by Mr. E. H. Bowen, who was detailed to aid in the preparation of this material. 'The reversal of the secular motion of the declinati.on over the greater part of the continental portion of the United States, exclusive of Alaska, during the past ten years makes it very important that a new isogonic chart should be prepared, and the accumulation of data since the last publication of isoclinic and isodynamic charts makes it desirable to prepare a revised edition of these charts. A tabulation of the latest values of the declination, .dip, and horizontal intensity at all the stations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey within the area mentioned has been made, and a new discussion of the secular variation is in progress. The tabulation of the data for the earthquakes recorded by the, seismographs at the magnetic observatories was brought up to the end of 1905, except inthe case of the Sitka Observatory. A map was prepared for the Wellman polar expedition, which shows the distribution of the magnetic forces of declination and horizontal intensity in the north polar regions.
TIDAL DIVISION.

Harmonic analyses of ti.de observations were completed for 5 stations with aggregate length of l year and 7 months. · Nonharmonic reductions were made for 218 stations with an aggregate length of 42 years and 10 months. Tide notes were prepared for 407 stations on 109 charts ~nd So original hydrographic sheets. '.fidal information wa5 furnished to the field parties and to individuals not connected with the Snrvey in response to 332 requests, involving the preparation of 393 descriptions of bench marks, tidal data for r 87 stations, and current data for 34 stations. Tabulations of high and low water and of 110urly heights of the sea were made for 14 years and 9 months of selfregistering tide-gage records from 27 stations, and mean sea level was obtained from hourly heights of the sea for about 47 years at 15 stations. There were received, exam" ined, and registered in this Division an aggregate of 15~ years of record from selfregistering tide gages at 25 stations, together with 4 years and 8 months of record from staff gages. Tidal records and data were received from outside sources as follows: Brazil: Tracings of marigrams at 4 stations for 1. month at each station. Franz Josef Land (Ziegler Polar Expedition): Hourly heights and high and low waters at 2 stations with aggregate length of 5 m.onths.

Two Filipino students were under instruction in this section during the year and made good progress in learning cartography. The increase in the number of new drawings for charts, completed during the year, is gratifying. In addition to the work mentioried above, 649 charts were revised, corrected, and verified for new .editions or new prints; 9 projections for topographic sheets and 31 for hydrographic sheets were constructed for the use of field parties or the Office;. 448 topographic and hydrographic sheets were inked, plotted, revised, or made ready for the approval of the Office. The drawings for charts in the Philippine Islands were prepared at the suboffice in Manila. These dra~ings were carefully examined and completed for publication by adding titles, notes. compasses, etc. In republishing charts of the Philippine Islands, extensive corrections were required to most of the drawings.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1906.

The output of the Photographic Section has been larger than that of any preceding year. During the year experiments in etching charts on copper were conducted. Satisfactory progress was made and 7 charts were etched. These all required more or less recutting in the Engraving Section. The seal, compasses, and scale5 were engraved.

Cl1art Section.

In this section all letters relating to the sale of charts, tide tables, and coast pilots were prepared; the accounts with sales agents were kept; the buoys were colored, and other routine work was done. Progress was made in the preparation of a new edition of the chart catalog. Copies of 34 new charts, all printed from stone, were received for distribution. Fifty-six new editions of charts, 28 printed from plates and 28 from stone, were also. received for distribution. Charts were received as follows from the Drawing and Engraving Division:

A comparison of the total issue of charts for the fiscal year with the issue in previous years sh9ws the total to be 46 per cent larger than the average and 5 per cent larger than the previous fiscal year. The charts issued from the suboffice at Manila, P. I., are not included in the statement made above. ·' · The number of letters prepared in the section shows an increase of l r per cent during the year.

'' INS'I'RUlllEN'I' DIVISION.

In this Division an account was kept of all instruments and general property owned by the Survey or purchased during the year except the articles on the inventory of the . Office at Washington. All necessary repairs were made to the instruments used by the Survey. Minor repairs were made to the Office buildings and furniture and progress was made in constructing a new tide-predicting machine. The tide indicator at Fort Hamilton, N. Y., was remodeled al the Office, and a plan of the changes necessary to make the operati~n of the indicator continuous even when the surface water freezes was devised. For details of this plan see the report of the work done by Assistant · Ritter. One of the dip circles was fitted with a telescope in such a manner that it can be used as an alt-azimuth instrument in determining azimuths. This change was suggested by the Inspector of Magnetic Work for the purpose of increasing the usefulness of the instrument. To meet the requirements of the Coast Survey work in the Philippine lslands, in determination of longitudes by the telegraphic method where there are no telegraph lines or cables, a wireless telegraph outfit was purchased and an experimental receiver, based upon the principle devised by Schuhmacher, was made, which combines simplicity with sufficient sensitiveness to reach distances up to 50 miles. This receiver has proved to be quite satisfactory as far as comparative tests can show. Four duplicates of the spirit level devised and adopted by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, made for the Survey of India Department, Debra Dun, India, by private parties subject to inspection and approval by the Superintendent, were carefully examined and recommended for approval. · · Nickel-steel or '' Invar,'' in the form of tape suitable for base measurement, was purchased and made into 50-meter tapes. These tapes have a very small coefficient of expansion, and are softer than steel tapes. They require a larger reel; when wound, than the steel tapes, to avoid the danger of a permanent change in length, and a light crowbar was made to be used with the tapes to replace the stretching apparatus formerly in use. T\VO of the transits used for longitude work were improved by adding attachments, as suggested by Assistant Edwin Smith; for the purpose of increasing the rigidity of their bases. This attachment.can .be clamped after adjusting the instrument without any change in azimuth or, in level as the result of manipulating this. device.:

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY BETWEEN JULY l, 1905, AND JUNE 30, 1906.
By L. A. BAUER,
Inspector of Magnetic Work a11d Clzief of Division of Terrestrial Magnetism, Assistant, Coast a11d Geodetic Survey.

INTRODUCTION.

The present publication contains the results of the magnetic observations made on land and at sea by members of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the prosecution of the magnetic survey of the United States and outlying territories during the period July I, 1905, to June 30, 1906. Five magnetic observatories t have been in continuous operation thruout the year: At Cheltenham, Md.; Baldwin, Kans.; Sitka, Alaska; near Honolulu, Hawaii, and on Vieques Island, Porto Rico.

OBSERVATIONS ON LAND AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

The distribution of the stations on land is shown in the following table, from which it will be seen that the work of the year, while principally in the region where magnetic data are most needed, viz, in the States west of the Mississippi River and in the Hawaiian Islands, was distributed over 43 States and Territories:

give a complete account, for the entire United States, of the secular change, and to map out the extent of the reversals noted in last year's Report (p. 111). A set of tables giving the secular change in the magnetic declination will be found in Appendix 4 of the current volume, where is also given a new chart of the Lines of Equal Magnetic Declination in the U1;1ited States, for January 1, 1905, with accompanying text.*
OBSERVATIONS AT SEA AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

The policy of making magnetic observations at sea as often as the regular surveying duties of the ships of the Bureau would permit has been continued. Observations were made by the Bache during her cruise from Norfolk, Va., to Maine and return, and from Norfolk to Key Wtst, Fla., and Galveston, Tex. (thus securing a valuable series of observations in the Gulf of Mexico), and return; by the Explorer on her cruises between Norfolk and Maine and return, and to Porto Rico and return; by the Patterson on the way from Seattle, Wash., to Alaska and return. The Carnegie Insti-. tution of Washington thru its Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, as is known, has undertaken a systematic survey of the oceanic areas. ' The Bache, Patterson, and Explorer are each provided with a Lloyd-Creak dip circle and accompany~ng gimbal stand, by means of which dip and relative intensity can be determined on board ship. Observations for declination (or ''magnetic variation'') are macie with the usual standard liquid compass and an azimuth circle of the Ritchie or Negus pattern. Each value of declination, dip, or intensity ·usually depends u,pon the mean of observations made on 8 or 16 equidistant headings while steaming in a circle, once with port and once with starboard helm. In some case$, however, observations were made on three headings, namely, on the course, one or two.points to the starboard of the course, then a like amount to port and back again on course. The three magnetic elements were determined at sea at 47 different points in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific Ocean. ·

Obser:vers engage_d exclusively in magnetic work are supplied with a complete magnetic outfit, consisting of theodolite-magnetometer, dip circle, half-second pocket chronometer, an observing tent, and small accessories, while those who are expected to get magnetic results incidental to other work are supplied with more or less complete outfits,· according to circumstances. Where only declination results can be secured under the conditions involved, a compass declinometer is supplied; but to those who can attempt more, a dip circle with compass attachment is furnished, with which compact outfit; knowing .the azimuth of some reference mark from triangulation or other source, the declination, dip, and total intensity (Lloyd's method) can be obtained, as repeated experience has spown, with a very fair·degree of accuracy.
SEA WORK.

The sam·e methods as in the two previous years have been u'sed. It was related in last year's Report (p. n5) tpat the use of the Lloyd-Creak dip circle, as at present .constructed, had been found by two of the Survey vessels to fail for determining the total intensity when a certain magnetic latitude was reached. The Carnegie Institution magnetic sur\rey yacht, the Galilee,' had a similar experi~nce on her 1905 cruise from San Diego to Honolulu. When a dip of about 40° was reached, deflections for the existing distance between the deflected and deflecting needles became impossible, as the earth's' total magnetic force was en'tirely overcome by the magnetic force of the deflecting needle, rendering the attainment. of a' position of equilibrium between the operating forces impossible. · Accordingly one of the Lloyd-Creak dip circles (No. 35) was modified in the instrument shop of the Survey, so that the original deflecting distance was increased from 7 .3 to 7 .9 centimeters, permitting the making of deflection observations, with the increased distance, in all parts of the globe likely to be traversed by the Survey vessels. At the same time a second deflecting distance ( 9.4 centimeters) was furnished for use if necessary, and also for more effectively controlling the instrumental constants than possible with but one distanc-e. Furthermore, the loaded needle, when in use as a deflector, is now mounted in a special nonmagnetic metallic case, avoiding unnecessary handling of the needle. Change from one deflecting distance to the other is accomplished by mei·e reversal, within its bearings, of the case containing the deflecting needle. It was proven by investigations in Washington that the discrepancies noted between the dip results obtained directly and as deduced from the deflection observations were largely due to the lateral play of the deflected or suspended needle (No. 3) in the jewels, namely, the maker does not always succeed in getting the pivots precisely of the same length for all the needles belonging to the same circle, so that it becomes necessary, in order not to have some of the needles bind, that for others more play may result than desirable. It is especially important that ·there be no more play than absolutely essential (so as not to have needle stick) for the suspended needle used in

the deflection, observations; for, otherwise, with the motion of the ship or due to the rubbing of the brass point with the ivory scraper, the suspended needle moves back and forth in the:. jewels. by an amount. sufficient to cause appreciable .·cbanges in. the deflecting distance and, hence, in the intensity constant as determined by the shore observations. This defect has been remedied by adjusting the jewels for the deflected needle (No. 3) and replacing those of the needles which stuck for this adjusted position by new ones. For certain sl~ore work, in determining geographic position of station, or for getting the azimuth for declinations with the compass attachment where no other instrument is available, an astronomical telescope has been added to the Lloyd-Creak dip circle No. 35, thus making it a complete magnetic instrument-theodolite, dip circle, and magnetometer combined-for use with expeditions whose outfit, for one reason or another, must be limited. The above modifications are shown in the accompanying illustration.
ACCURACY OF RESULTS.

The endeavor in general is to secure, on land, declination and dip observations whose absolute error (including everything involved--error of observation and reduction) shall not exceed 2', and to determine the horizontal intensity within 1 part in 1 ooo. As stated in previous reports, the experience of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has been that, under all of the conditions involved in a campaign of field work covering a large area, including the standardization of instruments and the determination of reduction errors, this accuracy cal1 not be much increased. In observatory work with special instruments, or when special investigations are made under the best conditions by special observers, there is no difficulty in reducing these limits of error; but in a large organization, where results must. be secured from all kinds of observers, under all conditions, and at times under great physical difficulties, and when all sources of error are considered, the degree of accuracy stated must be regarded as satisfactory and sufficient. It happens, of course, that these limits, for one reason or another, are occasionally exceeded, and there may be a few isolated cases in which the errors are two or three times the amounts given.
COMPARISON OF INSTRUMENTS.

Comparisons of field instruments with the standard instruments of the Cheltenham Magnetic Observatory have been made when conditions demanded it or opportunity offered. The magnetometer and dip circle which had been loaned to the second Zeigler Polar Expedition, and used for their observations at Teplitz Bay, were standardized at Cheltenham. The Lloyd-Creak dip circles in use on the steamers Bache and 1:.xplorer were standardized there in November, and again in June, and each of these vessels was provided with a magnetometer, so that the stability of the intensity constant could be further controlled by shore observations in the progress of the season's work. Individual comparisons were also secured at various places in the progress of the field work, where the same station was occupied by different observers with different instruments. These comparisons show that few changes are required in the instrumental correcti9ns

Index corrections have been applied to declination results obtained with compass dedinometer or compass needle. In addition, the results with several magnetometers ·have been corrected by small amotmts, as the·result of careful comparisons with standard instruments. In Deceinber, 1905, a careful examination was made of magnetometer No. 19, and the source of error was traced to the brass collar thru which the thermometer was inserted into the magnet house. A new one was supplied and no correction \';as required after that date.

REDUCTION OF THE OBSER VAT JONS.

A first computation is made by the observer in the 'field, aiid he is· instructed to carry it far enough before he leaves a station to assure himself that the desired degree of accuracy has been attained. This computation is carefully revised in tJhe Office, in the Division of Terrestrial Magnetism, and the necessary corrections are applied to reduce the results to the standard instruments, as indicated in the foregoing section. Each yalt1e of the magnetic declination is then corrected to reduc~ it'to the mean of the partiCular month in which the observation wa-; made, with the aid of the continuous observations at the nearest magnetic observatory, allowance being made for the change ill' diurnal variation, with change i11 magnetic latitude. No attempt has been made to correct the dip and horizontal intensity for diurnal variatioii.
ARRANGEMENT OF THE TABLES.
LAND OBSERVA'flONS.

The values of declination, dip,' and liorizont~l intensity presented in Table I are nr-ra1)ged by States alphabetically, the results for each State being given in the l;rder of increasing latitudes .. The latitudes mid·longitudes are in 1.nost cases the result of solar observations made with the small theodolite which forms a part of the magnetometer. h1 default of observations·the,geographic coordinates were scaled from the best available map, either the United States Geological Survey topographic sheets, a Post Route map, or a Rand & McN ally State map. . In such cases only the nearest whole minute of latitude and longitude is given. The horizontal intensity is exprest, as heretofore, in terms of the one hundred thousandth part of a C. G. S. unit of intensity of ma~netic force,· termed a gamma, ancl designated by the letter y.

DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS.
Magnetic observers are instructed to mark every station in as permanent a manner as possible, either with a stone or a post of some durable wood, so that it may be available for future occupation. They are also required to furnish a sufficiently detailed description to locate the station even if the marking should be destroyed, and to determine the bearing of two or three prominent objects in addition to the one used as reference mark in the azimuth and declination observations. The information is given in abridged form on the following pages for each of the stations occupied during the year. Further details can usually be obtained on application to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The usual method of marking a station is by a stone post about 3 feet. long and 6 or 8 inches square, set so as to project an inch or two above ground, and lettered on top U. S. C. & G. S., with a drill hole in the center to mark the exact point. \Vhene,·er the local authorities desired and were willing to bear the expense a second stone was set to denote the true meridian. The descriptions of stations are arranged alphabetically by States and by names of station.
ALA8KA.

IJ£xo11 flarbor.-Magnetic observations were made at South 'Vest Hase. The azimuth mark is triangulation station 8econd and hears 17° 05 1 .5 east of south. Fort Egbert ( 1~·aglc).-The station is 57. 1 feet north of the astronomic station at Fort Egbert and in the meridian of the transit No. 18. This point is called station A in the small triangulation which was made to connect with the meridian mark, Eagle Peak and other points. It is marked by a concrete pier 1 foot square, the top of which is level with the ground and the center defined by a 1-inch copper pipe. The following true bearings were determined:

iJ[c Kenzie Inlet. -The magnetic station is located at triangulation station "Isle" on an islet near the head of McKenzie In let. The azimuth mark is triangulation station '' Change'' and bears 13 ° 11'. 2 west of north. St. Miclzael.-Stations I, II, Mesa, and Hill Top, established in 1902, were reoccupied. Station I is 68.5 feet south of the concrete astronomic pier. It is marked by a small stub driven flush with the ground, a nail deternlining the exact spot. The planing-mill smokestack bears 49° 04' .8 east of north. Station II is 24 feet nearly due east from Station I and is markecl \>y a 4 hy 4 inch stake. The planing-mill smokestack bears 48° 4o'.3 east of north. Station III A: As the old Station III could not he located, a new station was established I 17.2 feet east and 4 feet north of the astronomic pier. It is exactly on the east and west line of the north side of the Observatory. The station is marked by a 2 hy 4 inch stub. The planing-mill smokestack hears 48° 25'.3 east of north. The Catholic church spire bears 22° 481 .8 east of north. Mesa is in the tundra about a quarter of a mile north of the astronomical station. It is marked by a 2 by 4 inch stub, a stake of splinterecl board about 5 feet long being driven down on the north side of the stub to mark its location in the long grass. Hill Top: A signal pole and tripod were fouml standing over the station, which is 85 feet northwest of the store and 100 feet east of the schoolhouse. It is about 1 ooo feet from Mesa. Observations were made at two points on the line from the station to the astronomic pier, one sY. and the other 8 feet distant. The astronomic station bears 35° 001 .o west of south. North is 17 .8 feet due north of the center of the astronomic pier, being 13. 7 feet north of the north wall of the observatory. It is m&.rked by a I Y, by 4 inch pine stub driven flush with the ground, the head of a nail showing the exact spot. The following true bearings were <letern1ined:

Hilo, Cocoa1111t Js/a11d, Hawaii /sland.-The station of 1892 and 1900 was reoccupied. It is the triangulation station "Mokuola," and is tiiarked by a triangular concrete monument, about 4 feet on each side, having a granite stone set in the center of it. It is inscribed "Bureau of Public Lands, A. B. Lobenstein, 1896." This whole monument has apparently shiftecl about 18 inches toward the northwest and subsided somewhat (especially on the northwest side), so that it is no longer level on account of the washing out of the sand on the northwest side by the action of high waves. This change has probably taken place since the observations of 1900. The attention of local surveyors and of the Hilo office of the Territorial Survey was called to the change. The present observations were made over the center of the stone in its present position on account of the difficulty of cletermining the exact original position and the impracticability of setting up the instrument so close beside the large monument. The following true bearings were detcrminecl:

Jlilo, Jloolleau Park, /lawaii Jsland.-As some local attraction was suspected at the station on Cocoanut Island a new station was selected on the mainland, in Mooheau Park, about a mile from the fom1er one. It is located near the center of the park, about I<X> yarc!s from the seashore. It is directly in line with the second row of pillars in ivlooheau Hall ancl 220 feet from the nearest pillar in that row. It is 182.5 feet from the fence along the street and about 72 yards from the railroad along the beach. It is markecl by a rough stone 16 inches long ancl about 6 inches square, set flush with the ground and having a half-inch drill hole to mark the exact point. The soil here is black sand.

Kae11a Point, Oalm Island.-The station is located between the railroad and the sea, just opposite the beginning (coming from \Vaiahia) of the main curve of the railroad around the point. It is on practically the only spot of solid red soil on the point, the surrounding soil being almost entirely sand. It is about 12 feet to th.e right of the path (not very definite) leading from the gap in the railroa<I fence toward the extreme point. It is 48 paces from the railroad fence and 68 paces from the sand limit along the rocky coast. It is marked by a wooden stake drh·en flush with the ground, over which was placed a large bowlder about 15 inches in diameter, rather fiat on one side, with the letters U.S. roughly chipped on top. This is the only bowldcr of any size within a radius of 25 or 30 feet. The tent pegs were all left in place, driven almost flush with the groun<l. The azimuth mark used was the center of the "Railroad Crossing" sign post, seen thru the cut toward \\'aiahia, bearing 80° 03'.o cast of north. Ka/111k11 Ra11cli, Oalm Jsland.-The station of 1900 was reoccupied. It is situated in the yard, Oil the llorth side (i. e. toward the rai!Toad track) of the dwellillg house occupied by the manager of the Kahuku Ranch, about half way between the northeast edge of the house and the northwest corner .of stone wall of yard, 4 paces west of algaroba tree and 23 paces east of west stone wall. It is marke<J. by a stone set flush with the ground, with a drill hole in the middle, the center of the hole beillg 73.8 feet from the northeast edge of the spring house, I 12 .5 feet from the northwest edge of small extension to dwelling house, and 145.3 feet from northeast edge of house. The mark used was the left edge of a prominent bowlder in the slope of the mountain ridge to the west, bearing 65° I r'.8 west of south. Kalmltti, llfaui Isla11d.-The station of 1899 was reoccupied. It is on the first prominent sand dune east of Kahi°ilui, about 200 feet back from the beach. It is marked by a subsurface mark of a bottle in cement and a similar surface mark.

The cemetery is almost clue west. The sage brush was cleared away for about 20 feet around the station. In order to find enough earth to set a monument the station was put up at the foot of the slope of crumbled lava. The station is marked by a sandstone monument, 6 inches square, set 2 feet c!eep with 5 inches projecting. The top face is letterer! U. S. C. & G. S., 1906, with a cross.

LINES OF EQGAL :11AGNE1'IC DECLINA'fION FOR 1905.

The large number of new, reliable, and well-distributed determinations of the magnetic elements made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, chiefly within the past seven years, has made it possible to undertake the construction of new magnetic maps for the United States with an accuracy not hitherto attainable. In the present publication is given the first of these new maps-the one for which there is at present greatest demand-viz, the Isogonic Chart or the Chart of the Lines of Equal Magnetic Declination and of Equal Annual Chan~e in the United States for 1905. There will appear later a special publication entitled The Distribution of the Magnetic Elements in the United States and Regions under its Jurisdiction for January 1, 1905, which, besides giving the isogonic lines for the United States proper, will likewise give them for the outlying islands and territories under the jurisdiction of the United States, as also the Charts of the Lines of Equal Magnetic Dip ancl of Equal Horizontal Intensity for 1905. The common period selected for all of these charts, January 1, r 905, is one for which, owing to the recent numerous reoccupations of ''repeat'' stations, the secular change reductions are, in general, well known over the entire region embraced. The last Isogonic Chart for the United States, for January 1, 1902, was published separately and also appeared in the United States Magnetic Declination Tables for 1902. This chart, with the accompanying text and tables, was in such great demand that shortly after its issue a second edition was required, which in turn is almost exhausted. It was therefore urgent to issue a new chart for as recent a period as practicable and one which should embody the results of the many recent determinations of the magnetic declination and its secular change. For the first time it has become possible also to construct an isogonic chart for the United States, utilizing only data the value of. which is precisely known.

words, only such valties of the magnetic declination have been utilized as were obtained with well-tested instruments, either magnetometers, declinometers, or compasses. In former years, owing to the meagerness of available accurate data, it was necessary to utilize values obtained by surveyors or by others who had not determined the corrections of their instruments, which may easily, for one reason or another, amount to from onefourth degree to a whole degree and more at times. It may be said, in round numbers, that the present chart depends upon accurate observations at 3 500 fairly uniformly distributed points over the United States. The actual number of observations made is of course more than 3 500, for a '' repeat '' station has only been counted once. Of this number of points about 3 ooo represent observations by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and the remainder were obtained partly by parties with whom the Survey cooperated and partly by parties working under the auspices of other organizations. Of the latter, chief mention should be made of the work of the United States Lake Survey engineers around the Great Lakes, the State magnetic surveys of Missouri, New Jersey, Maryland, North Carolina, and Louisiana, and the series of observations made under the auspices of the Bache Fund of the National Academy of Sciences, 1872-1876. Since almost all of the values utilized are already in print in one form or another, it is not deemed expedient to republish them here. However, in the special publication referred to above it is proposed to do so, not only for the magnetic declination, but likewise for the other magnetic elements; not only will the observed values be given with full reference to source, but also the values reduced to January 1, 1905. A new feature of theJ>resent chart is the extention of the isogonic lines over the oceanic areas embraced by the chart. These extensions rest upon all available recent sea observations resulting from complete swings of the vessel and obtained chiefly by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the United States Navy, aiid the British navy. Doubtless what will most impress one who looks at the present chart is the large number of twists and turns and peculiar features exhibited by the isogonic lines over the land. In this respect this chart represents more of these sinuosities and irregularities than any hitherto issued for this country. This must be accepted as sufficient proof that the present chart gives a more accurate representation of the actual facts of nature than any previous one; for it is a well-known fact that the more numerous the reliable observations are the more devious become the lines of equal magnetic declination. In fact, experience is teaching more and more that it is not the irregularities which are the abnormal features, but that, on the contrary, tkey are the normal features; regularities or uniformities in the distribution of the earth's magnetism over the land do not exist in nature, at least not for any extended area. Gracefully flowing curves of equal magnetic declination usually mean that either the observations were too few or that no dependence could be put upon the irregularities shown by them, or that the attempt was purposely made to eliminate the local disturbances. When discussing the general magnetic conditions of the entire earth some smoothing-out process is desirable; however, when studying the actual magnetic conditions of a certain area the first endeavor must be to get at the real facts as thoroly and as accurately as possible. Mean values of the magnetic declination for an area are not wanted even by those who must make practical use of such data any more than the hydraulic engineer desires

for his special problems the average altitude or, say, the average contour line of a whole district or county. Hence, in the present chart, no well-substantiated fact of nature has been eliminated, the lines were drawn to conform as closely as possible with the plotted, observed data. But even in the present'instance it must be borne in mind that the true and complete representation of all the present facts (to say nothing of those which still more detailed work will reveal) can not be given by lines of equal values. All that is claimed is that the endeavor has been made to give as true a representation as possible on the scale of the base map used. With multiplication of data it may be depended upon that the twists and turns will become still more numerous. If the scale of the charts permits, it is best to reproduce the actual plotted values. By carefully examining the isogonic lines it will be seen that there are a number of most interesting correspondences between the twists and turns of the lines and wellknown physiographic features, such as coast lines, mountain ranges, rivers, etc. Such correspondences were apparent to a certain extent in the chart for 1902, but in the present one they stand out much more clearly, primarily because of the more numerous data. But these features, however interesting, can not be dwelt upon at length here, but will receive proper attention in a special publication, where a combined treatment of the local disturbances shown by the three magnetic elements, declination, dip, and intensity, will be undertaken. The isogonic lines are broken in certain regions to indicate that there the observations were not sufficient to make sure of their precise course. The magnetic survey of the United States as far as completed embraces, on the average for the entire country, one station at which the three magnetic elements have been reliably determined for an area of about 900 square miles, or 30 miles square. In some States, for one reason or another, the stations were more frequent or less frequent, as the case may be, than these figures would imply. This will be set forth more fully in the complete publication already cited. Suffice it to say here, that not only has it become possible in the construction of the present isogonic chart to embrace only such declination data as were known to be reliable, but, likewise, for the first time has it become possible to construct the three sets of charts ( deelination, dip, and intensity) as based upon practically the same stations, or, in other words, upon practically homogeneous data. It may therefore be expected that a discussion and mathematical analysis of the local and regional magnetic disturbances will be more fruitful than was possible hitherto. The future magnetic survey work will consist in multiplication of stations in regions where the number falls considerably short of the average given above, and in disturbed regions, and also the repetition of observations at "repeat" or well-selected stations for effectively controlling, with the addition of the data derived from the magnetic observatories, the secular changes, thu·s making it possible to always reduce past work to a future date.* It may also be said that, considering the area involved (3 025 600 square milesnearly equal to that of Europe-or about one-sixteenth of the entire land area of the globe), the United States of North America possesses the most complete magnetic survey of any country. Certainly nowhere else have the secular variation data received

so much attention and been so completely studied as in the United States. Had equal attention been paid in other countries to this important matter, the knowledge of the secular changes over the globe would be in a much more satisfactory condition than is the case now.
LINES OF EQUAL ANNUAL CHANGE FOR

r905.

These lines (the dotted ones on the chart) give in minutes the amount of change in the magnetic declination per annum .. It will be seen that this amount varies over the entire country, from nothing to 4', so that the amount of annual motion of the lines of equal magnetic declination varies from nothing to about -{ 6 of the distance between any two of them. It will be noticed that the annual change lines differ considerably from those of r902 owing to the great increase of data within recent years and. because of peculiar changes amounting even to reversals of direction encountered in certain parts of the country, which could not have been anticipated with the data available at that time. The note on the chart states that ''The north end of the compass is moving to the westward for places east of the line of no change, and to the eastward for places west of the said line, at an annual rate indicated by the lines ef equal annual change (dotted lines). In other words, east of the line of no change the isogonic lines are moving westward, whereas to the west of the line of no change they are moving eastward." Accordingly three regions must be distinguished: (a) In the region of the United States east of the agonic line or line of no magnetic declination, where west declination prevails thruout, there the declination is increasing from about 2' to 4' per annum. It will be seen that the amount increases with distance from the agonic line until the New England States are reached, where the maximum change occurs, thence, with further progression northeastward, the annual change begins to decrease until a region is reached, which can not be shown on the map, where there is no change, viz, where west declination has reached a maximum value and is, in consequence, nearly stationary at presen~. (b) In the region between the agonic line and the line of no annual change, which runs practically parallel to the agonic line, the magnetic declination· (east) is decreasing at the rate of o' to 2' per annum. (c) In the region west of the line of no annual change, where the magnetic declination is east thruout, it is increasing at the rate of o' to 4' per annum. In pursuance of the supposed steady progression of the secular variation waves westward, it was thought that when easterly declination had reached a maximum amount or turning point-as actually took place, for example, along the California coast between r88o and r890--that thereafter east declination would diminish. On the contrary, however, after remaining nearly stationary for a while, it began to increase very rapidly, so that at present the annual increase is 376' to 4'. In other words, the maximum of r 880 to r 890 was apparently .not a principal one, but a secondary one. This extremely interesting tho troublesome reversal of the secular change has moved to the eastward, and so rapidly that in twenty years it had already crossed the Mississippi River, and it appears to be still progressing eastward. It was due chiefly to this feature of the secular change that a new reduction of the previously utilized data became necessary.

APPENDIX 4.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION.

On the other hand, there is also no question but that the phase of maximum west declination, which, as intimated above, has already set in in Labrador and Newfoundland, is steadily moving southwestward. Hence, there is occurring in the United States at present a most interesting conflict of secular waves, which will necessitate keeping a close watch on the changes for some time to come. The effect of these complicated changes, as·pointed out in the note cited above, is to move the isogonic lines which lie east of the line of no annual change, westward, and those west of the noannual-change line, eastward, or in other words, the lines are being crowded together from both sides of the line of no change. This effect, considered in company with the known changes in dip and intensity, as will be shown in the complete publication mentioned above, i~1plies that the magnetic north pole has moved during the past twenty years chiefly southward, the west component of motion being greatly subordinate to the southerly one. Some statement can also be made as to the general character of the changes in the \Vest Indies and Mexico. The line of annual change 2', lying east of the line of 110 annual change, after leaving South Carolina, skirts the east coasts of the Bahama . Islands, then presumably passing thru Haiti, proceeds southward of Jamaica a degree or two in latitude, then touching the southwest corner of Cuba passes thru the Gulf of Mexico to the north of Yucatan, and then most likely proceeds almost westward thru Mexico. East declination is diminishing at the rate of about 3' per annum in the vicinity of Mexico City. Since, as shown in the Chart, east declination is increasing at the rate of about 3' per annum along the entire north boundary of Mexico, it is evident that somewhere between the botmdary and the parallel of 17°, the line of no annual change after leaving Alabama and passing thru the Gulf, proceeds westward thrn Mexico in about latitude 24 °-the precise delineation must be- deferred until more data from Mexico are at hand. In Porto Rico, at the eastern end, west declination is at present increasing at the rate of 7' per annum.
SECULAR CHANfE TABLES.

Owing to the facts related above, it became necessary to revise the secular change tables of the mag·netic declination given in the Declination Tables for 1902. An exhaustive recompilation of all available reliable data for the entire country was undertaken, and from the statements already made it is apparent that the data now possess a completeness not hitherto possessed. By a graphical process, which will be more fully explained in the special publication where the changes for the other magnetic elements will likewise be treated, the secular changes were determined for the regions represented by the tabular groups. In order to avoid the necessity of using . signs to indicate the direction of the secular changes the tables have been put in the most readily serviceable form possible by referring the changes to some well-known place in the locality and giving the actual declination at that place for ten-year intervals. It should be borne in mind, however, that the actual changes were deduced from all the data in the vicinity. This procedure will suffice for any use that the land surveyor may make of the tables in relocating old boundary lines ·run by the compass. More elaborate tables, restricted on the average to about thirty years prior to 19o'5, were utilized in the reduction of the declinations to 1905 used in the construction of the Chart.

Secular Change Tables.

On the following pages will be found for each State and Territory one or more tables, arranged alphabetically, showing the change in declination from 1750, or the date of the earliest available observations to the present time. rhe figures on any line refer to the 1st of January of the year given in the first column. Each table is based on the average value of declination observed at the place given in parentheses, but represents equally well the chauge in direction of the compass needle in other parts of the general region to which it refers. In using these tables the surveyor must bear in mind the uncertainties inciqent to the use of the compass and not be surprized if, for example, the change in declination for the last hundred years, as given by the tables, differs by half a degree or more from the value indicated by his own determinations. Even at the present time many compasses are in error by as much as a quarter of a degree, owing to imperfect construction or lack of proper care, and one hundred years ago the state of affairs was still worse, so that an error of half a degree was not unusual. These tables give approximately the actual change in the magnetic declination and do not take into account the error of any particular compass. Whenever the surveyor is called upon to redetermine the boundary line of a tract of land run out at some previous period with a compass, and can find in the vicinity a well-defined line known to have been established with the same compass and at about the same time as the survey of the tract under consideration, he can not do better than determine the amount of the change in the compass bearing of this weII-defined line and use it to obtain the present bearings of the boundary !in.es to be reestablished. In this way he wiII take into account and eliminate the errors of the compasses used in the original and in the present survey. Only in the absence of such definite information is the use of the following tables recommended.

The use of the tables may best be explained by a few examples: ( 1) What was the change in declination at Augusta, Ga., between June 1, 1825, and September l, 19o6? In the table for Georgia the values for 1820 and 1830 are 5° 53' E. and 5° 44' E., showing an average annual decrease of o'.9; hence the value for 1825, June 1, would be 5° 53'-(o.9X 5.4)=5° 48 1 E. Similarly, the table gives for 1905 the value 2° 02 1 E., with an annual decrease of o'.5; hence the value for 1906, September 1, would be 2° 02'-(o.5X6.7)=1° 591 E. Therefore the north end of the needle pointed 3° 49' more to the west September 1, 1906, than it did June 1, 1825. (2) The magnetic declination at Allegheny, Pa., was 2° 561 W. in Au~ust, 1885. What was it in January, 1800?

APPENDIX 4.

From the table for western Pennsylvania are derived the values o 0 37 1 W. for January, 1800, and 4° 12 1 W. for August, 1885, showing a change of 3° 35 1 in the interval; hence the declination at Allegheny for the earlier date was 2° 56' \V.-3° 35 1 , or

(3) A rectangular piece of laud at Santa Barbara, Cal., was surveyed by compass in May, 1832, and the bearings recorded as follows: N. 20° 15 1 W., N. 75° 3o' E., S. 18° 45 1 E., and S. 78° oo' W. What bearings should be used in order to retrace the lines in September, 1906? From the table for southern California the values 13° 161 E. for 1832 and 15° 16' E. for 1906 show a change of 2° to the eastward in the interval. The desired bearings are, therefore, N. 22° 15' W., N. 73° 3o' E., S. 20° 45 1 E., and S. 76° oo' W.
