REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT
OF 1"E

U.S:COAST A N D GEODETIC S U R V E Y
FOR T H E FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1893.
I N TWO PARTS.

P A R T I.
RECORDS OF PROGRESS IN FIELD A N D OFFICE WORK. ESTIMATES FOR FUTURE PROGRESS. REPORT OF EXPENDITURES.

PREFATORY NOTE.

The text of this Report for the fiscal year 1893 has bcen arranged for publication in two parts, like that for the fiscal year preceding. Part I, in quarto form, contains the historical portion. It presents abstracts of progress

in field and office work, gives estimates for future progress, and a statement of expenditures during t h e fiscal year. Accompanying it are maps of general progress, and sketches more in detail showing the localities of field operations referred to in the reports. In Part 11, in octavo, are published the Appendices which relate to the methods, discussions, and results of the Survey, with such illustrations as are required. The octavo form is more convenient and suitable for the scientific and professional papers, while the quarto form appears to be demanded for the statistical matter and the progress sketches. Since the latter are of less general interest than the former, in the future distribution of the Report, Part I1 only will be sent, as it is believed that this will include all that is generally desired, and in a much more compact and convenient form than that of the old quarto.

In special cases, where both parts are desirable, they will be sent.

PART I .
INTRODUCTORY S T A T E M E N T .
The advance in the operations of the Survey during the fiscal year 1893,which is briefly outlined.in this introductory statement, is exhibited more in detail in the summary of general progress; in tbe abstracts of reports from field parties, and in the tabular statements and office reports; and is illustrated by the progress sketches which appear at the close of Part I. Upwards of seventy-five field parties were employed during the year upon the coasts or within the limits of fourteen States on the Atlantic and Gulf seaboard; two States and one Territory bordering on the Pacific Ocean and on Bering Sea, and in eight States and two Territories in the interior. Their work included the measurement of base lines; reconnaissance and triangulation; determinations of time, latitude, longitude, and azimuth; observations for the force of gravity and determinations of the variation of latitude; geodetic leveling; observations for the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity; topographic surveys, and hydrographic work involving f fshore soundings and observations of currents and tides. inshore and o The preliminary surveys needed for the location of the Northeastern Boundary Line between the United States and the Dominion of Canada are advancing toward completion; the resurvey of Boston Harbor, made necessary by changes both natural and artificial during the past forty years, is in active progress, the survey of the Connecticut River to the head of tide-water is nearly completed, and that of the Hudson River toward Troy has made good progress; stations were occupied in the State of Tennessee for connecting the triangulation of that State with the triangulation of the State of Kentucky; a reconnaissance and triangulation resting upon the Atlanta Base has been carried through Georgia and Alabama and nearly completed to the Gulf of Mexico; progress has been made in the reconnaissance for a triangulation along the Rio Grande which will result in a more precise location of that part oE the boundary line between the United States and Mexico; surveys have been begun for the location of the boundary line between California and Nevada from Lake Tahoe to the Colorado River, and officers of the Survey have been sent to southeastern Alaska, under instructions to co-operate with officers detailed by the Dominion of Canada in locating the boundary line between Alaska an$ British Columbia.

SPECIAL SERVICE.

In Compliance with requests from National, State, or municipal authorities, and with the approval of the Department, certain officers of the Survey were detailed for special service as follows: One to co-operate with the Commission organized for the adjustment of the boundary line between the States of Delaware and Pennsylvania; one to delineate accurately upon suitable maps the boundaries of the natural oyster beds of the State of Virginia; one to act as a member of a Board of Engineers to devise a system of sewerage and grading of streets for the City of San Francisco, and one to co-operate with the Harbor Line Commission lof the State of Washington in harbor surveys on Puget Sound. 8. Ex.19-1 1

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Notices more in detail of the work of these officers will be found under the heading Special Operations " toward the close of this volume. Under the same heading will be given brief summaries of the operations begun in southeastern` Alaska in 1893 by officers assigned to duty on the Alaska-British Columbia boundary surveys.

SPECIAL APPOINTMENTS.
'

I n accordance with law, one of the older officers of the Survey has continued to serve as

a member of the Mississippi River Commission, and another is still serving, by appointment

of the President, as a member of the International Boundary Commission, organized for the location of that part of the United States and Mexican boundary line extending from the Rio Grande to the Pacific.

WORLD'S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION.
A t the World's Columbian Exposition the Snrvey was represented by a carefully prepared collection of instruments and apparatus that were best adapted to illustrate the several branches of field work; by a selection from the publications, and by sets of standard weights and measures. I n order to exemplify fully the recent improvements in hydrographic work, particularly in apparatus for deep-sea sounding and observations of currents, the Coast Survey Steamer Blake, supplied with a complete equipment of such apparatus, was moored a t the Exposition wharf.

-

OFFICE O F S T A N D A R D W E I G H T S A N D MEASURES.
The regular work of this Office has been somewhat interrupted during the past fiscal year by the extra labor involved in preparing a suitable exhibit for the World's Columbian Exposition. Some progress was made in the preparation of two complete sets of Standard Weights and Measures for the States of North and South Dakota, and in compliance with a request from the State of Ohio, the Standards belonging to that State were polished and adjusted. T h e usual amount of work was also done for the other branches of the United States Government. For the Internal Revenue Bureau sugar flasks were graduated, and comparisons were made of alcoholometers and quartz plates; for the Customs Division valuable aid was rendered in securing suitable sheet-metal gauges to conform with the act of Congress of March 3, 1893,and a 7a-inch scale for the Ordnance Office, War Department, was graduated and its corrections determined in terms of the National Standard. T h e new balance of precision, for which a special appropriation was secured, was received a t this Office in the latter part of the past fiscal year (April 14,1893),and was found to be in accordance with specifications. T h e question, however, of a suitable place wherein to mount this delicate apparatus is still an unsettled one, and I urge that a sum sufficient to build the necessary room and piers be appropriated. For this purpose an appropriation was asked for of $I 800 in the estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894,but unfortunately it was not secured. T h e increased demands from individuals for comparisons of weights and measures with the National Prototypes, and t h e information furnished them by this Office, make apparent t h e growing importance of this branch of the Department, and the necessity of keeping up with its requirements need not be urged. Similar bureaus in foreign countries far surpass this in the number of persons employed and the facilities for the prompt execution of work. I n April, 1893,a Bulletin, approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, was issued by the Superintendent of Weights and Measures announcing that in the future the Office would regard the International Prototype Metre and Kilogramme as fundamental standards, thus putting our weights and measures in direct relation with those of all other civilized nations.

I.

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT.

3

T h e recommendations made in my preceding annual reports that the use of the metric system of weights and measures should be made obligatory in all transactions a t United States Customhouses, having been sanctioned by the Department, I would suggest the first day of July, 1895, as a suitable date for the inauguration of this reform.

ARRANGEMENT O F P A R T I, WHICH C O N S T I T U T E S T H I S VOLUME O F T H E R E P O R T FOR T H E FISCAL YEAR 1893.
Part I, of this Report, contains prefatory note; introductory statement; notices of special service and special appointments; notice of the exhibit of the Survey a t the World's Columbian Exposition; statement relative to the Office of Standard Weights and Measures; statement of the order of contents of the report, followed by a statement relating to the geographical order of the localities of field work; general statements of progress in field and Office work; explanation of estimates and estimates in detail; abstracts of reports from field parties and reports of special operations; abstracts of the annual office reports; notices of the sub-offices a t Philadelphia and San Francisco, and concluding statement. T h e supplements to these records of progress comprise the following named tabular statements and office reports: Table No. I , Distribution of the field parties of/ the Survey; Table No. z, Statistics of field and office work; Table No. 3, Information furnished in response to requests, official or personal.. The annual officereports are : No. I, that of the Assistant in charge of the Office; No. 2, that of the Hydrographic Inspector; No. 3, that bf the Disbursing Agent; No. 4, that of the Assistant in immediate charge of State Surveys; No. 5 , that of the Assistant in charge of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures. A list'of the maps and sketches illustrating the advance of the work to the close of the fiscal year follows, and the sketches themselves complete the volume. The progress of the Survey afield and afloat throughout the entire territory of the United States 'to the close of the fiscal year is shown graphically in the maps o t general progress Nos. I and 2, and in maps Nos. 3 and 4, which exhibit progress in Alaska, I n map No. 5 are shown the longitude stations and connections determined by means of the electric telegraph between 1846 and the end of the fiscal year; in map No. 6 are given the positions of the stations occupied for determination of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity between 1844 and June 30, 1893, and in map No. 7 are shown the lines of spirit leveling of precision run, and the positions of gravity stations occupied to June 30, 1893. Map No. 8 shows the distribution of the principal astronomic stationcoccupied by, the Survey for latitude, longitude, and azimuth to January, 1894.

GEOGRAPHICAL ORDER OF T H E LOCALITIES O F F I E L D WORK.
The arrangement of the localities of field operations in a geographical order in four Divisions, which was begun in the Report for 1891, has been found very convenient for reference, and is continued in this Report. These Divisions are: 1- T h e Eastern Division, including the States east of the Mississippi River. 11. T h e Middle Division, comprising the States and Territories between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. 111. T h e western Division, including the States and Territories between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific. IV. T h e Division of Alaska, including its coasts bordering on the Pacific Ocean, on Bering Sea, and on the Arctic Ocean; also its inlets, sounds, bays, rivers, and the Aleutian and Pribilof islands.

Field work in Alaska included also the operations of the parties organized in the spring of 1893, and sent to make the surveys required for the preliminary location of the boundary line between Alaska and British Columbia. .These operations involved reconnaissance and general surveys on the Unuk, the Stikine, and Taku rivers, and in Holkham Bay, and chronometric longitude exchanges with the astronomical station at Sitka ;also co-operation with the Canadian parties for the collection of data to enable the United States and Canadian Commissioners to reach an agreement respecting the location of the boundary line. Reference to reports made by the officers in charge of these parties will be found under the heading 6` Special Operations."

OFFICE WORK.
The annual report of the Assistant in charge of the Office, which is accompanied by the reports of the chiefs of the several Divisions of the Officeis published as Office Report, No. 1, toward the close of this volume, and presents in concise form a reciew of progress made during the fiscal year. In Office Report No. 2 is given the annual report of the Hydrographic Inspector. Abstracts of these reports follow the abstracts of reports from field parties. Throughout the year, the improvements introduced into methods of computation: in the construction of instruments and in facilities for work in the shops, and in the arrangement and classification of the library and archives, give gratifying evidence of unremitting efforts t o S a ~ r increased e results with economy of time and cost.

HYDROGRAPHIC DISCOVERIES A N D DEVELOPMENTS A S ANNOUNCED I N NOTICES T O MARINERS.
The prompt publication of discoveries or developments made in the progress of the operations of the Survey has undoubtedly been of great service to the security of navigation and to the interests of commerce. In the Notices to Mariners, published monthly during the fiscal year, information is given of changes in aids to navigation, of dangers discovered, of new life-saving stations established, of changes in depths or of new channels in harbor approaches, and generally of all information deemed useful to mariners who have occasion to consult the charts of the Survey. Each number of the Notices contains the titles of new charts or new editions of charts, lists of charts cancelled and lists of new publications. Thirteen separate Notices were published during the fiscal year, and 130 ooo copies were printed for free distribution. They are sent to the agencies of the Survey in the principal ports of the United States; to United States Customhouses; to the branch Hydrographic Offices of the Navy Department in the leading seaport cities; to .United States Consulates in foreign ports, and are supplied at these places to all applicants, as also at the Office of the Survey in Washington, and at the Sub-offices in Philadelphia and San Francisco. Among developments or changes of importance published in these Notices in the course of the fiscal year may be mentioned the following: Notice No. 157, August, 1892,Important changes in depth in the eastern entrance to Nantucket Shoals; No. 158, September, 1892,Dangerous rock in the approaches to Boston Harbor; No. 160,November, 1892,Increase in depth in East River, New.York Harbor, by the cutting down of Thirty-fourth ,Street Rock; No. 161, December, 1892, Discovery of a rock with but 18% feet of water over i t off the foot'of Twenty-sixth street, East River: No. 165, March, 1893,Change in depth over Flood Rock, Hell Gate, New York Harbor, and Discovery of dangerous rocks in Puget Sound between Middle Point and Point Wilson; No. 166,April, 1893,Changes in the characteristics of lights on the Florida Reefs; No. 168,June, 1893,Discovery of a sunken rock in Carmel Bay, California, and report of a sunken reef west of Cape St. Elias, Alaska. The corrections to the charts made necessary by these and other changes of importance are carefully apPlied to each chart h u e d from the Office, and the date of issue is stamped upon each chart. Corrections of later date found in subsequent Notices can then be added as desirable.

BULLETINS.
The professional papers offered for publication during the year, which it was deemed desirable to publish in the form of bulletins, thus anticipating their appearance in the annual reports, were the following: (I) Observations at Rockville, Maryland, for the Variation of Latitude in co-operation with the International Geodetic Association. Description of station, instruments, and methods of observing, by Edwin Smith, Assistant. Reduction of observations and discussion of results, by Charles A. Schott, Assistant. This paper, which was submitted for publication October 14, 1892, and published as Bulletin No. 25, November 29,is the first contribution made by the Survey to our knowledge of the variation of the latitude. It was the last of the series of bulletins, Nos. I to 25, inclusive, published in quarto form, and constituting Vol. I. (2) Fuqdamental Standards of Length and Mass. Approved for publication April 5, 1893,and published as Bulletin No. 26.

Confinuation o f the iopQgraphyand hydrography o f the Northeastern Boundary Lakes.-At the beginning of the fiscal year, Assistant Stehman Forney, chief of one of the parties aspigned to the continuation of the survey of the Schoodic Lakes had been in camp for about two weeks on the east shore of Grand Lake. From this camp he executed the shore line and topography of the northern end of Chiputneticook Lake, of Pirate Cove, of Mud Lake, of the southern end of Grand Lake, and of the arm of Grand Lake. Upon completing this portion of his work August 27, he struck camp and moved his party on board a large scow which had been loaned to him as a transport by the Sh?w Tannery Company of Forest City, Maine. T h e scow having been towed to North Lake he took u p the topography of North Lake Thoroughfare and of Monument Stream to the Initial Monument and to Pole Hill station, and upon finishing the topography, took up and completed the hydrography of the same localities. Mr. Forney found the Initial Boundary Monument in the same condition as described by Assistant Boyd who carried the triangulation to that point in the autumn of 1889. (Report for fiscal year 1890,pp. 16, 17.) With regard to Monument No. 2, which is about one mile true north from Initial Monument, and which is the first of the small monuments on the line between the Initial Monument and the town of. Holton, 15 miles distant, Mr. Forney reports that, like all the rest, it is easily moved by hand, and that in view of the temptation thus held out to persons wishing to evade the customs laws of either the United States o r Canada, some more effective methods of defining the boundary line should be adopted. On October 26, 1892,field operations were closed and all of the camp equipage and the boatg of the party were transferred to Assistant Joseph Hergesheimer, who had charge of surveys in another portion of the Schoodic Lakes. For the season the statistics ar&as follows: Topography (4 sheets, scale 1-10 0 0 0 ) : Area surveyed in square statute miles - _ _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ -_ _- _- ___ _ _ 28.5 Length of shore line of creeks and lakes in statute miles-- - - - - _ _ - _ _ _ 92 Length of roads in statute miles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - _- - - - - - - - I 1-25 Hydrography (3 sheets, scale 1-10 0 0 0 ) : Area sounded in square geographical miles - _ _ - - - - - - ._ _ - - - - - - _ _ - --: I O Number of miles (geographical) run while sounding.. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 56 I 18 Number of angles measured - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Number of soundings- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 7 930

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

During the following winter, Mr. Forney was ordered to duty in charge of reconnaissance and triangulation work on the Rio Grande. Report of this will be made under a heading in the Middle Division. Topographic and hydrographic survey o f Grand Lake, Northeastern Boundary, confitrued.--In continuation of the topographic and hydrographic survey of the Northeastern Boundary Lakes, Assistant Joseph Hergesheimer took up under instructions on July 9, 1892,the survey of Grand Lake from the South Arm, where the parallel of 45O 40' north latitude crosses the lake, and continued his work northward to Thoroughfare Bridge, where the lake is crossed by the parallel of 45' 4 9 ' . Between the date just named and October 15,when field operations were suspended, he completed the shore line contours and hydrography upon two projections and upon part of a third. Much unfavorable weather was experienced during the season; out of the one hundred and seven days spent in the field, rain or gales of wind retarded progress on forty-five days. Mr. Hergesheimer will submit a descriptive report to accompany his field sheets. Messrs. H. T. Marshall and B. H. Griswold were attached to the party as recorders, and rendered satisfactory service. The statistics are as follows: Topography (1-10 0 0 0 ) : Area surveyed in square statute miles 9 Length of shore line of lake surveyed in statute miles 72 Hydrography ( I-TO 0 0 0 ) : Area sounded in square geographical miles - - - - - _ ---- - - - - 29 Number of miles (geographical) run while sounding - - - - - - _ _ _ - - - - 395 Number of angles measured ,_ 2 693 Number of soundings____ -28 695 Hydrographic exatnitrations for the Coast Pilot oft the Atlantic Coast.-Instructions issued in June, 1893,to Lieut. E. H. Tillman, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Endeavor, directed him to prepare the steamer for service on the Atlantic Coast in the examination of harbors, verification of soundings, sailing lines, etc., for the use of the Coast Pilot. Before entering fully upon this duty, however, he was directed to proceed to Boston Harbor and get a steam launch which he was to tow to Eastport, Maine, for the use of the Superintendent in the Northeastern Boundary work. On his passage from Hampton Roads, Lieut. Tillman made a short stop at the Delaware Breakwater to make slight repairs to engine, and while there he locatkd the Five Fathom Bank Light vessel by angles at night. Later in the month, while underway for Eastport with the launch in tow, he made a special hydrographic examination in the Kennebec River, , running 3.8 miles of soundings and locating a numher of rocks, among them a rock with but I O feet of water over i t at low tide, information relative to which was published in dotice to Mariners, No. 169, for July 1893. This work was accomplished on June 29 and 30. Lieut. Tillman then proceeded to Eastport, and, after delivering up the launch at the time stipulated, took up the execution bf the work which had been assigned to him for the season. Topographical resumfey o f the shore line o f Boston Harbor.-Reference was made in the last annual report to the beginning of a topographical resurvey of the shore line of Boston Harbor by Assistant R. Meade Bache, after a conference with Assistant Whiting, held by direction of the Superintendent, and resulting in fixing the limits desirable for the resurvey and the scale upon which it should be prosecuted. In compliance with Mr. Whiting's suggestion, the resurrey was begun at Squantum on the south shore of the harbor, and carried thence over 6he shore lines of Quincy Bay, Fore River and Weymouth Back River, Hingham Harbor and Weir River to Nantasket Beach, the results being shown upon two topographical sheets, each upon a scale of 1-10 000.

Mr. Bache observes that the country is characterized by long, rolling, isolated hills, interspersed at intervals with ragged ledge formations of considerably less elevation. A peculiarity of the shores on the south side of the harbor, which has doubtless much increased since the last survey, is the manifest silting up of those parts of the harbor to just the height which makes a depth of water enabling eel grass to reach its most luxuriant growth. Instead of being, as.usually found elsewhere, a filmy growth appearing on the surface of the water and making only a slightly pronounced feature in topography, it continues from shore for a quarter to half a mile or more, until relatively deep water is reached, and is so dense in growth that even at half-tide i t becomes in many places laborious to pole a boat through it. Much delay in the prosecution of the work was caused by the loss of many of the station marks of the old triangulation. Although the approximate positions of these stations were ascertained, the subsoil marks could not be found. The statistics of the season, beginning July 7 and ending November 2, 1892,are: Topography (scale 1-10 000): Area surveyed in square statute miles _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - -_--- - - - 18.5 -Length of general harbor line in statute miles - - _ _ _ - - d - - - .- - - - - 47'2 Length of shore line of creeks and ponds in statute miles _ _ _ _ X I * ~ Length of railroads, streets, and roads in statute miles - _ _ - - - _ - - _ _ - - - - - 32'9 After returning to Philadelphia, Mr. Bache took up the inking of his plane-table sheets. In accordance with instructions previously received, he took charge of the Sub-office in that city November 12, relieving Assistant S. C. McCorkle who had been directed to report for duty in Washington. During the winter and spring he finished the drawing of a map, scale 1-2 400, of the Philadelphia City Front for the city, and also the inking of the two topographic sheets which were the product of his season's work in Boston Harbor. Immediately before resuming his field work in that locality, he connected the Stierle tide gsuge on the site of the old Navy Yard, Philadelphia, by lines of leveling with several bench marks in its vicinity. Reaching Boston early in June, Mr. Bache met Assistant Whiting for conference, and then proceeded to Hingham to complete the arrangements for taking up his survey which had been begun by his foreman sent on in advance. Fogs of unusual duration and stormy weather delayed progress during the month of June, and the number of subsidiary triangulation points was found to be inadequate ; progress made in that month was accordingly quite limited, but later in the season, the weather having greatly improved, and arrangements completed for the determination of all needed points, very satisfactory results were reached. Up to June 30, 1893, the statistics reported are : Topography (scale 1-10 0 0 0 ) : ------ ---- --- --I Area surveyed in square statute miles - - Length of genera1 coast in statute miles _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ---------- - - - - - - - - - 10 - _ _ - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 3 Length of roads in statute milesI Mr. Bache pbserves that in amount, the topography was really a larger product than the mere statement of area would imply, for the reason that the area surveyed was covered with houses and other details, including in fact the sumher resort, Nantasket, which is SO thickly built UP as to represent a continuous village. Progress after the close of the fiscal year will be adverted to in the next annual report. ToPowWicaZ resurvey of shore line o f ~ O J t o Harbor n in the vicinity of Winrthrop Beach and Point Shir@.-The resurvey of the northern and northeastern shore line of Boston Bay and Harbor having been assigned to c.

He found great changes in the shore line since the survey made by Mr. Whiting in 1866, much of the beach having been washed away by heavy northeast gales. Much unfavorable weather prevailed during the month, and up to the end of the fiscal year but eight working days had been obtained. Statements of progress after that date are reserved for the next annual report. Hydrographic resurvey o f Boston Bay and Harbot-.-Reference was made in the last annual report t o the beginning of a hydrographic resuryey of Boston Bay and Harbor `by the party under charge of Lieut. W. F. Low, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the schooner Eagre. I n this important resurvey the following named officers were associated with Lieut. Low, each one being charged with certain portions of the hydrography to be executed : Lieut. Edward M. Hughes, U. S. N., assistant, commanding the steamer Back; Lieut. C. E. Vreeland, U. S. N., assistant, commanding the steamer Blake, and Lieut. L. K. Reynolds, U. S. N., assistant, commanding the steamer E d e a v o r . T h e hydrography assigned to Lieut. Low was included within the limits of three projections, one on a scale of 1-2 500,embracing the inner harbor, the Navy Yard and its vicinity, etc.; the other two projections on I--IOooo each, and covering an area from Medford to beyond Chelsea Beach on the north, and from Neponset River to .Peddocks Island on the south. Between June I , 1892, and November 30, when field operations for the season were suspended, Lieut. Low had completed all of the hydrography upon his projection No. 8, scaIe 1-2 500. T h e entire shore and wharf line on this projection were new, and were drawn in from data furnished by the Harbor and Land Commissioners Office. T h e upper projection (No. I) on I-IOOOO included all of the hydrography of Boston Harbor and approaches from Lynn Harbor Entrance on the north to Deer Island on the south, excepting of course that embraced within the limits of projection No. 8. Work on projection No. I was finished, with the exception of that portion of Charles River from the Brookline Bridge, u p a distance of about a mile and a half, and some additional soundings in Shirley Gut. Upon projection No. z, scale 1-10 000,including the northwestern part of the main ship channel, President Roads, the waters about South Boston, the Neponset River, etc., fair progress was made. To the north of Neponset River there remains a n area of one square mile to be finished, and the hydrography of South Bay and Fort Point Channel was neces;arily postponed. T h e officers attached to the party on the,Eagre were Lieutenants G. W. Mentz and C. S. Ripley, U. S . N.; Draughtsman C. H. Deetz, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey; Pay Yeoman R. W. Stevens, U. S . N., and Ship's Writer Wm. B. Proctor, U. S. N. For the season, beginning June I and ending November 30, Lieut. Low reports statistics as follows: Hydrography: Number of miles (geographical) run while sounding - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 652 Number of angles measured - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -. - - - _ _ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 0 `49 Number of soundings - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - _ -- 64 4x0 16 Number of tidal stations established - - - - .- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - During the winter the party was engaged in preparing the hydrographic records and sheets for transmission to the archives. I n March, Lieut. Low was instructed to begin the preparations needed to fit the Eagre for next season's work. Having arrived in Boston harbor May 9, 1893, the unfinished portions of hydrography on sheets Nos. I and z were taken up. On June 1 2 the schooner was moved to Hull so that the party might work to greater advantage. At the close of the fiscal year field operations were in active progress. T h e officers attached to the party during the season of 1893 were Lieut. Charles S. Ripley, U. S. N.; Ensigns Chas. P. Plunkett and Lloyd H. Chandler, U. S. N.; Pay Yeoman R. W. Stevens, U. S. N., and Ship's Writer Wm. B. Proctor, U. S. I T .

Edward M. Hughes, U. S . N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer B a c h , was laid out on a projection numbered 4 (scale I-IOOOO) of the general scheme. With eastern limits from beyond Three and a Half Fathom Ledge on the north to beyond Hardings Ledge on the south, and western limits from Winthrop Head and Point Shirley on the north to the southwestern end of Long Island on the south, it included the main ship channel and approaches, and the numerous rocks, bars, and ledges in these portions of the harbor demanded very careful examinations. Lieut. Hughes has submitted for file in the Archives a descriptive report in which full. reference is made to the characteristic features of the hydrography. All soundings were corrected from the readings of a single tide gauge which was established a t Fort Warren, Boston Harbor. Comparative readings were taken for connecting this gauge with the main ' tide gauge at the Boston navy yard. But little change was noted in the shore line of islands, etc., falling within the limits of the hydrographic sheet, most of the parts subject to erosion having been protected by seawalls of granite. T h e large appropriation which became available in the summer for the improvement of the harbor and its vicinity, to be expended by the United States Engineers, is to be applied in part, it is understood, to the deepening and straightening of the main ship channel, the work to extend somewhat to seaward of the Narrows Light. Careful note was made of all localities in which a less depth of water was found than that shown on the charts, and the necessary corrections will be made as soon as the soundings have been plotted and verified. A list of these localities is given in the report; also a list of places where the shoalest depths found were greater than those shown on the charts. T h e officers attached to the Bache were Lieut. W. L. Burdick, U. S. N.; Ensigns H . Rodman, G. W. Kline, and J. W. Oman, U. S. N. Mr. J. L. Dunn served as observer; Mr. E. P. Ellis, as draughtsman, and Mr. Thos. S. Martin, as pay yeoman. For the season, beginning July I I and ending September 30, 1892,Lieut.

C. E. Vreeland, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Blake, was assigned the hydrographic resurvey included within the limits of projection No. 7 (scale 1-10 0 0 0 ) of the general scheme. T h e area covered was that of the approaches to Boston Harbor from the southeastward, Stellwagen's Ledge, the Cohasset Rocks, Minots Ledge, and Cohasset Harbor. Following the detailed instructions of the Hydrographic Inspector, a careful search in boats was made for hidden dangers wherever comparatively shoal detached soundings indicated the possible existence of a ledge. Only in two cases however, were developments of importance made. These were, a pinnacle rock with 3% fathoms of water over it, about 2% miles to the eastward of Minots Ledge Light, and a 14-foot spot on the '' Tar Pouch," to the northward and eastward of Scituate. These discoveries were promptly made known to the maritime public in Notice to Mariners, No. 158,for September, 1892.

I n addition to the principal hydrographic sheet (No. 7 ) two sub-sheets, 7 A and 7 B on scales of 1-5 ooo and 1-20 000, respectively, were laid out to include outlying portions of the hydrography. Toward the end of September the BZake proceeded to New York, and on October 3 Lieut. Vreeland reported under instructions to Commodore Henry Erben, U. S. N., and placed the steamer at his disposal for participation in the Columbinn celebration on October I I. T h e fourth hydrographic party engaged i n the resurvey of Boston Harbor and approaches was assigned to the charge of Lieut. L. K. Reynolds, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Endeavor, the localities of his work being in Broad Sound, the waters around Nahant, and the entrance t o Lynn Harbor. Lieut. Reynolds was occupied during part of the month of July, 1892, in certain examinations for the Coast Pilot on the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island; in locating uncharted rocks reported as existing in Great Captains Harbor, and off Larchmont, Connecticut, Long Island Sound, and, early in August, in determ'ining the position of the steam yacht A h a , which had been sunk,in Pollock Rip Slue. On August 11, he began preliminary operations in Broad Sound by the erection of s i p a l s and the location of such permanent land marks as could be made available for running lines of soundings. North and south lines were run outside of the Io-fathom curve % mile apart, and inside the Io-fathom p r v e @ mile apart. Additional lines were run in such places as were necessary in order to develop fully the 6, 12, and 18 foot curves. From all headlands, such as Nahant Head, Bass Point, and Grover's Cliff, radiating lines were run, and were continued into deep water. Special attention was given to develop fully Lynn Harbor Entrance. Lieut. Reynolds observes that the main ship channel into the Harbor is practically the same as now shown on the chart, but the channel to the eastward of this as shown on the Boston Harbor chart of 1-40 ooo scale and known locally as Black Rock Channel is not used, as it is now almost closed a t its upper end, just as it joins the main ship channel. Great care was taken in the examination of all charted rocks, and in most cases the positions given on the charts were found to be fairly accurate. All soundings were reduced to a plane of reference derived from the observations of high and low waters a t the tide gauge erected by Lieut. Hughes a t Fort Warren Wharf. T h e officers associated with Lieut. Reynolds on the Endeavor were Lieut. Thos. W. Ryan, U. S. N., and Ensign*HughRodman, U. S. N.

Early in October, Lieut. Reynolds proceeded under instructions to New York, and toward the end of that month with the Endeavor t o Washington, where he continued the plotting of his hydrographic sheets and their preparation for the archives. I n December he was instructed to procged in his vessel with the party under his command to Maryland Point, Potomac River, and Tangier Sound, Maryland, for the purpose of locating the position of new lighthouses. Rderence to this service will be found under a subsequent heading.

Henry L. Whiting was serving as Chairman of the Topographical Survey Commission of the State of Massachusetts, having been elected to fill the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of Gen. Francis A. Walker, who had been Chairman of the Commission since its organization in 1884. T h e determination by triangulation of the boundarylines of the cities and towns of the Commonwealth is a work which was assigned to the Commission upon the completion of the topographical survey of the State. During the fiscal year 1893, under the general direction of Mr. Whiting, the town boundary surveys were carried on by three triangulation parties, one in charge of Mr. C. H. Van Orden, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, with Mr. W. C. Hawley as chief assistant, working in Berkshire County in the western part of the State: one in charge of Mr. J. B. Tolley, operating in the eastern part, mainly in Middlesex County, and one working more northwardly in Middlesex and in Essex counties, in charge of Mr. E. E. Peirce. Still another party was temporarily organized undei charge of Mr. R. A. Marr, formerly of the Coast and I Geodetic Survey, for the purpose of determining the boundary lines of the six townships on Marthas Vineyard. I n June, 1893, Mr. Van Orden* began a line of levels of precision, to be run from the tidal bench mark i n Boston Harbor, westwardly along the line of the Boston & Albany Railroad to the State line between Massachusetts and New York, with the intention of finally connecting it with the Coast and Geodetic Survey bench mark and with others of the United States Engineers on the Hudson RSver, near Albany. I n addition to the regular work of the State Commission, Mr. Van Orden was directed, in compliance with instructions from the Superintendent, to carry a line of levels between Sandwich and Plymouth, in Massachusetts, as a test of the contour topography of the Survey executed by Assistant J. A. Flenier. This work was done under the State Commission and a t its expense. Mr. Whiting made a special report to the Superintendent upon this subject, an abstract of which is given under the heading next but one following. I n connection with his duties on the Survey, he conferred and co-operated with Assistants R.M. Bache and C. T. Iardella in reference to the resurvey of Boston Harbor b y the parties under their charge. I n August, 1892, he accompanied the Superintendent in his inspection of the Boston Harbor and Plymouth surveys. Referring to his service as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, Mr. Whiting states that h e has attended to the correspondence and to the study of subjects, reports, maps, and sketches referred to him by the Commission, and that he was present at its meetings , during the year. One' of these was l k l d in New York in August, 1893; one in connection with the semi-annual inspection of the river a t its low-water stage in November, 1892,and one at its high-water stage in May, 1893. These last-named meetings are held on board of the steamer of the Commission at St. Louis; thence proceeding down the river they are adjourned at New Orleans.' After each of these meetings Mr. Whiting reported in person to the Superintendent for consultation and instructions.

Progress o f town boundary surveys in Berkshire, Essex, and, Mia'dZesex counries, Massachusefts; also o f geodetic ZeveZinf in Plymouth Couniy, and across the State frovr Boston to &bany.--In view of

the fact that the areas near the coast of the State of Massachusetts had been nearly covered by the town boundary triangulation, it was deemed desirable by the Topographical Survey Commission to start a new field of operations in the western part of the State. Accordingly, a t the opening of the seasdh in 1892,a party was organized in charge of Mr. C. H. Van Orden, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, who was directed to base his work a t the outset upon lines between such points of the main triangulation as were available, among these being Greylock, Perry's Peak, French,'s Hill, Berlin Mountain, Mount Everett, etc., and from these relatively long lines to come down to the shorter ones required for the town boundary work. Two other field parties were organized with instructions to advance the work in the eastern part of the State-one in charge of Mr. J. B. Tolley in Middlesex County, the other in charge of Mr. E. E. Peirce in Essex County. T h e town boundary surveys, as in previous years, involved the determination of the monuments at each well-defined corner o r bend in the town lines. T h e work was pushed north and west of Boston and south of Pittsfield, and was carried on in the field until September 12, 1892,when all of the parties returned to the office of the Commission in Boston, and took up the inking and duplication of their records and the computatipn of their observations. I n October, Mr. Van Orden was directed t o run a line of levels north and south over ground included in the topographical survey in Plymouth County made by Assistant Flemer, and referred to in the following heading. H e began a t the Sagamore Station on the Old Colony Railroad and ran to Manomet Station, a distance of about 14miles. Field work on the town boundary surveys was resumed by the several parties about May I, 1893. On June 6,Mr. Van Orden began a double line of levels between Boston and Albany, following the Boston & Albany Railroad track, and was engaged in this leveling a t the close of the fiscal year. Th,e statistics for t h e year, given by Mr. Van Orden in his annual report, are as follows: Triangulation: Area of, in square statute miles ___________________________ _ 47s Number of signal poles erected _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 410 Number of days occupied in opening and verifying lines of sight- - - 8 Number of stations occupied for horizontal measures - - - - - - - - - 499 Number of geographical positions, including town corners, determined 7 12

Tqographical survey o f an aiea o f 25 square miZes west o f Cape Cod Bay a?id sou#heasto f PCymouth, Mass.--lnspection o f t@ograjhy.-Some additions of topography being required for the chart of Cape Cod Bay on that part of the coast southeast of Plymouth, Massachusetts, a country presenting the general features of the rolling lands of New England, and coming under one of the classifications made by the Topographical Conference, it was decided by the Superintendent that the scale, 1-30 000, recommended by the Conference for this class of work should be adopted, and that the rules suggested for its execution should be adhered to. Reference was made in the last annual report t o the assignment of Subassistant J. A. Flemer to the charge of this survey and to the progress made in it from its beginning, May 28, 1892,t o the end of the fiscal year. Twenty-one of the 2 5 square miles covered by the entire survey were wooded, and the remainder consisted of clearings, ponds, and cranberry bogs. Of these bogs there were about forty, Briggs Bog, the largest and most productive, comprising about 80 acres and producing annually from 5 ooo to 8 ooo barrels of berries, which yield a n income of from $15 ooo to $go 000. Mr. Flemer observes that the geological character of this section places its formation in the drift or bowlder period, the deposit being arranged in layers forming knolls and basins.

Great numbers of the latter are filled with water. Manomet Hill, with the Pine Hills, the most prominent ridge in this part of the State, consists of great masses of loose drift material, having no solid rock foundation apparently, since no outcroppings of rocky ledges are visible. T h e bowlders are erratic blocks of a crystalline nature, consisting chiefly of a syenitic granite. T h e soil is a coarse white sand with but little admixture of loam. Mr. Flemer's elaborate and satisfactory report of his survey is illustrated by three sketches, the first showing the limits of the work, the second the points determined by planetable intersectiohs, the triangulation points, the roads, and the shore line determined by telemeter readings; the outlines of the ponds and cranberry bogs being indicated by full and dotted lines in blue, and figures in blue showing the water levels of the ponds above mean sea level. Upon the third sketch are plotted the comparative profiles of portions of the area surveyed as determined with the plane table by Mr. Flemer and as determined by spirit leveling by Subassistant Van Orden under the direction of Assistant Whiting. These profiles show a close accordance. Toward the close of the season Mr. Whiting made an official inspection and instrumental tests of the survey, in regard to which he'submitted a report to the Superintendent. From this report the following extracts have been taken: AS a topographical subject, particularly with a view to a comparison of methods of survey and their results in accuracy and characteristic representation, the tract of country which Mr. Flemer has gone over contains, in itsgeneral conditions as affecti n g the operations of a survey, more than the average hindrances to rapid progress and elaboration of detail. Primarily the field of his work was insuficiently controlled by triangulation for advantageous bases for plane-table stations or bench marks for elevation. This necessitated a more than ordinary extension of traverse work, requiring special care in its execution, as it became the only available means of determining positio'n and elevation. T h e features of contour, although not in themselves difficult to represent, became so in fact, on account of the thick growth of wood over large areas of alternating hills and valleys without a single point where an independent plane-table station could be made, or a view obtained of surrounding features. Mr. Flemer has shown much judgment and skill in conducting his survey and in meeting and overcoming these incidental difficulties. I made sufficient instrumental tests of the geographical positions and detail representations of Mr. Flemer's survey to establish its good qualities in these respects. I examined by inspection every case where there were noticeable differences between his results and those of the Massachusetts work (the State Survey) and can testify to the correctness of Mr. Flemer's. T h e topography executed is included in two plane-table sheets, scale of each 1-30 000; sheet No. J , from Manomet Hill to Savery's Pond, Ellisville, and sheet NO. 2, from Savery's Pond to Bournedale. For the season, beginning June I and ending September 30, the statistics are: Topography: - ---- -- ---- --- - -- - -- Area surveyed in square statute miles 25 Area of shore line of creeks in statute miles _--_ 6.2 Length of shore line of ponds in statute miles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - .---- - - - - 33'2 Length of outlines of cranberry bpgs in statute miles - .----- - - - ------ 10.5 Length of railroad in statute miles - - - - - - - - - _ -- - -- - - - - -- - - - - - - - "5 Length of roads in statute miles - - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - - - - - - - - - - . - - -- - - - '35

Physical /rydro~rap/lv.-Conh'nuation o f the physical hydrograjhic sur~ey o f the south coast o f MaYfhas vineyard f r o m Jobs Neck around Gay Head.--Tn pursuance of instructions for continuing the Physical hydrographic survey of the south coast of Marthas Vineyard, Assistant H. L. Marindin had re-organized his party in May, 1892,and a t the end of the fiscal year had made

Progress as stated in the last annual report.

24

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

On the first of July, the party was in camp at Jobs Neck on the south shore of the island, and was actively engaged in locating cross sections of the coast and in leveling them and sounding them out to deep water. This work was prosecuted for about 4 miles on each side of the camp, the limit to the westward being the opening into Great Tisbury Pond. During the month of July, the camp was moved 8 miles west to Chilmark, and field operations were continued from this site around the western end of the island to Gay Head, and up the sound as far as Lobsterville. At the end of the season the number of cross sections surveyed and sounded was 241. Mr. Marindin observes that the south shore of Marthas Vineyard is visited by ,rougher and heavier seas than the similarly exposed shore of Nantucket, owing, no doubt, to the absence of the off shore shoals which to some extent break the force of the waves on the south coast of the latter island. The tides observed for the reduction of soundings were recorded by means of a Stierle self-registering gauge with siphon pipe attachment. This arrangement worked satisfactorily, and seems to offer the only means of obtaining the rise and 'fall of the tides on an exposed coast where the usual methods with staff or box gauges can not be employed. Mr. Marindin acknowledges his indebtedness for efficient assistance to Mr. Homer P. Ritter, who was attached to his party as expert observer, and also to Messrs. Victor Safford and George 0. Glavis, acting aids. Field operations were suspended for the season on October I , after which Mr. Marindin took up office duty at Washington. Close o f record at the autmatic tide-gauge statim at Bristol, Rhode Island-After having been in operation about twenty-six months, the automatic tidal station at Bristol, Rhode Island, was discontinued in October, 1892. This gauge had been set up, and a continuous record secured without charge to the Survey through the liberality of Nathaniel G. Herreshoff, Esq., of Bristol. f tidal record at the automatic gauge sfation, Newport, Rhode Island-The Continuation o establishment of an automatic tide gauge at Fort Adams, Newport Harbor, which the officers of the United States Engineers, stationed as that post, kindly consented to superintend, was referred to in the last annual report. The record which began March 31, 1892,was continued throughout the fiscal year 1893, and the gauge was in operation at its close. Mr. David Hamilton is the observer. CompZetion o f t h topographical resurvey o f the south coast o f Long Island, between Napeague Bay and Montauk Point.-The progress of the topographical resurvey of the south coast of Long Island, executed by Assistant C. T. Iardella, was stated in the last annual report up to June 30, 1892. After that date, plane-table work was continuously prosecuted until October I 2, at which time the topography had been completed to and including Montauk Point. The results are shown upon two topographical sheets, the scale of each 1-10 0 0 0 ; No. I covering the area from Napeague Life-Saving Station to Split Rock, and No. z the area from Split Rock to Mont auk Point Light. Most of the stations of the triangulation on this part of the coast having been destroyed, Mr. Iardella was compelled to make a subsidiary triangulation to determine points for his plane-table work. He observes that the character of the country from Napeague LifeSaving Station to the boundary which divides Napeague and Montauk is low and sandy, the sand dunes along the coast presenting from a distance of several miles a broken undulating outline of hillocks from I O t o 40 feet high. Very extensive salt marshes, of much value for meadow land, line the shores of Napeague Bay. One mile from Napeague Life-Saving Station to the eastward a fence is built across the narrow neck from the outer sand hills to Fresh Pond, and the whole stretch to Montauk Point, a distance of IO miles, is a single great field with high hills, which affords pasture from June to October for several thousand cattle, sheep, and horses. Toward the end of October the farmers select their stock from this field and drive them home for the winter.

Resunlption o f the topograjhicaZ survey o f the Connech'cut River in the vicinity o f Hartford.-Assistant John W.Donn, upon taking the field in June 1893,under instructions to co-operate with Assistants Vinal and Boyd in bringing to completion the topographical survey of the Connecticut River, began operations at the northern limits of Hartford upon a sheet containing the shore-line survey executed by Assistant Hodgkins in the summer and autumn of 1891. This sheet included a distance in an air line of 1 1 miles, its southern limit being Taylorsville, on the east side of the river, and Drumhill, on the west. During the two weeks that elapsed between the time that Mr. Donn reached the field and the end of the fiscal year, his work was largely in the nature of a reconnaissance; the resultants of lines to natural objects delineated by Mr. Hodgkins were reviewed and examined in the field, and the values of such points as had been determined by favorable intersections were duly tested. Small areas were surveyed topographically when stations were made SO as to render unnecessary their future occupation. Six days were lost, either wholly or in.part, by rainy weather. Further progress will be adverted to in the next annual report. Duty assigned to Mr. Donn earlier in the fiscal year in New York and Maryland is reported under following headings. Continuationo f the topographical survey o f the Connecticut River f r o m HadZyme to Easf Haddam and Haddam Neck-Assistant W. Irving Vinal, acting under instructions issued in June, 1892, resumed the topographical survey of the Connecticut River in the vicinity of East Haddam, Connecticut, on June 17. Beginning at Hadlyme, on the east bank of the river, a belt of shore-line topography was carried toward East Haddam, surrounding the survey of that town executed by Mr. Vinal in 1891. The work was then advanced to include Goodspeed and Haddam Neck, and then was transferred to the west bank of the river, and the survey of Haddam and vicinity was nearly completed. T h e features of the country surveyed consisted of shore line, creeks, ponds, village detail, salt and fresh marsh, wooded contour, and extensive quarries. Unusudly hot weather in the latter part of July and early in August, and frequent storms in September .and November, somewhat delayed the progress of the work. One topographical sheet, scale 1-10 000,was finished and about one-half of a second sheet on the same scale. For the season, which closed November 18, Mr. Vinal reports statistics as follows: Topography: Area surveyed in square statute miles - ___..__ 14.1 Length of shore line of rivers in statute miles _ _ _ _ - _ _ _ _ _ 3'1 Length of shore line of'creeks and ponds in statute miles 26.5 Length of roads, including railroads, in statute miles - - - - - - - _ _ _ _ - _ 64.0 Upon returning to Washington, Mr. Vinal took up the inking of his field sheets, and was thus occupied until toward the end of January, 1893,when he was instructed to continue and complete the topographic and hydrographic survey of the Caloosahatchee River, Florida, which had been begun by Assistant Hergesheimer. Reference to this service will be found under a later heading. After returning from Florida, Mr. Vinal was engaged for a time on duty at the office, and about the middle of June, 1893,was instructed to re-organize his party for the resumption of the topographical survey of the Connecticut. Field operations were begun June tg

on the unfinished sheet of the preceding season, in the vicinity of Haddam, Connecticut, and from that date to the close of the fiscal year were in active progress, it being anticipated that with the co-operation of Assistants Donn and Boy?, assigned to the charge of parties on other portions of the river, the topography of the Connecticut will be completed when the field season closes. The following statistics are reported by Mr. Vinal of his survey, to June 30: Topography (scale 1-10 0 0 0 ) : Area surveyed in square statute miles ._____ 0'75 Length of shore line of river in statute miles _ _ - _ _ 2 Length of shore line of creeks in statute miles 2 Length of roads in statute miles.- 3'5 T@ographicaZ resurvey of fhe Connecticut River begun in the vicinity o f Middletozun.--Assistant C.H. Boyd, to whom was assigned the topographical resurvey of that part of the Connecticut River in the vicinity of Middletowti, has mad? a brief report of his field work during the time that elapsed from the beginning of his survey, June 19, to the end of the fiscal year. Four days during this time were occupied in searching for triangulation points, and two and a half days in actual plane-table work. Unfavorable weather and other causes pre4ented field operations during six and one-half days. Mr. Boyd's progress after June 30 will be adverted to in the next annual report. He observes that the topography to be mapped was found to be more intricate than had been anticipated, the hills being more than 500 feet in height, densely wooded, and having very rough slopes and sharp ravines. f tidal record at fhe aufomafic tidaZ sfafion at WiZZefs Poinf, New York.-The autoContinuation o matic gauge station established in July, 1891, at Willets Point, New York, and kindly put in operation by dfficers of the United States kngineers stationed at that post, has maintained a continuous record during the past fiscal year under the direction of Lieut. Herbert . Engineers. This record, taken in connection with that which will be Deakyne, U. S obtained from the gauge recently set up at Fort Hamilton, will supply valuable data, additional to that already available, for the study of the movement of the tide in New York Bay and Harbor and at the eastern end of Long Island Sound. f the Hudson River andfriangutation incidentalthereto continued-Assistant Topographical survey o John W. Donn, having been instructed to resume the topographical survey of the Hudson River, had taken the field before the beginning of the fiscal year and employed his party in the determination of trigonometrical stations needed before plane-table work could be taken up. The base selected for the scheme of subsidiary triangulation was the line South BeaconProspect Hill. Seven signals were erected and eight stations occupied for horizontal measures, and after the completion of the computations the topographical survey was begun, This survey was extended south of Newburg to join the work of the preceding season above Cornwall, the margin of topography being. gradually widened as Newburg was approached so as to include Mount Alice (Snake Hill), 2 miles west of the river. The work was carried well into the city, embracing all partly improved streets as far to the west as South street, an area which includes about seven-eighths of the city. The business and some of the more thickly settled residential streets were filled in from the official map of the City Engineer, Mr. Caldwell, who courteously offered to Mr. Donn every facility at his command. The survey of the eastern side of the Hudson was carried on from above Fishkill to the, southward. This town and Matteawan having ho municipal government, no official maps were available for filling in details of streets, etc. The topography on this side was carried to the foot of the mountains. Massaic Creek at the south limits of Newburg and Fishkill Creek on the opposite side of the river, flowing through deep valleys bordered by many factories and mills, presented

obstacles to rapid progress, as did also the several railroad lines passing through or having their termini within the cities and towns. T h e many tracks, stations, and wharves of the New York Central 8z Hudson River Railway, the West Shore, the New York and Erie, the New York and New England, and the Dutchess County Railway, added much to the intricacies to be overcome. Mr. Donn' states that a small part of Newburg and a still smaller area of Fishkill remain to be surveyed. Field operations were closed for the season October 30.

During the winter of 1892-'93, Mr. Donn was engaged in inking his topographical sheet and preparing his records for deposit in the archives: I n March he was instructed to make a survey of Hog Island, Patuxent River, Maryland, which had been selected as a quarantine station. Toward the close of the fiscal year h e was assigned to the charge of a topographical party on the Connecticut River.
Tqographical survey of EZZis Island, N e w York Harbor.-In order to show the correct position of the buildings occupied on Ellis Island, New York Harbor, for the United States Immigration Station, and the location of new wharves and other improvements, a topographical survey of the island was found desirable, and in December, 1892, Mr. Homer P. Ritter was directed to execute this work. With a detail of men furnished by Lieut. Edward M. Hughes, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Bache, Mr. Ritter completed a plane-table survey of the island, on a scale of 1-2 500, on December 30 and 31,haying had to wait for some days for the arrival of his instruments, which were delayed by the intensely cold weather then prevailing. Mr. Ritter expresses his thanks to Lieut. Hughes for valuable assistance rendered. T h e area included in his survey was one-fortieth of a square mile, and the length of shore line four-fifths of a statute mile. Xstallishtnent of an automatic tide-guage, una' erection o f a tidal i d c a t o r a t Fort Hamilton, Nrw YorR Nurbor.-In December, 1892, through the courtesy of the commanding officer of Fort Hamilton, New York Harbor, permission was given to the Superintendent for the establishment of an automatic tide guage on the wharf of the fort, and later for the erection of a tidal indicator, so arranged that the masters of vessels navigating the Narrows would be informed of the state of the tide by simple inspection from shipboard. T h e tidal observer, Mr. J. G. Spaulding, has kept up the record to the end of the fiscal Year, and it is proposed to keep this guage in operation for several years. Toward the end of April, 1893,Assistant H. L. Marindin was instructed to proceed to Fort Hamilton, and set iip on the tide house there a tidal indicator, so adjusted that the movement of the index from zero of the scale would enable navigators to ascertain whether the tide was rising or falling and its height a t any time. At zero, the index was made to indicate mean low water as shown by the reading of the staff a t the tide house. This apparatus was carefully tested by Mr. Marindin during two days and found to work well, but the tests for the limit of visibility both for the naked eye and with the aid of a

binocular were unsatisfactory. Another apparatus was accordingly constructed in the Instrument Division of the Office from designs by Mr. E. G. Fischer, chief instrument maker, and he was instructed to pyt it up at the tidal station in place of the first one. This work, involving the framing of heavy timbers and securlng them to the wharf for the support of the guys to the indicator, the mounting and adjustment of the mechanism, etc., was completed in five days, with the aid of Mr. G. W. Clarvoe of the Office. Through the kindness of the captain of a steam launch belonging to the War Department, Mr. Fischer was enabled to test the visibility of the indicator at distances of half a mile and three-quarters of a mile offshore ; at half a mile the direction of the arrow head of the index was visible to the naked eye ; at about three-fourths of a mile the scale could be read with a low-power binocular to one-eighth of a foot. The entire apparatus, as left in adjustment by Mr. Fischer has continued to work satisfactorily. Close o f tidal record at the automaticgauge station, Sandy Book, New Jersey.-During the earlier part of the fiscal year the automatic tidal station at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, was in charge of Mr. J. G. Spaulding, and during the latter part in charge of Mr. Eugene Veith. The gauge having been in operation since December I , 1886, and a record secured sufficient for the requirements of the Survey, the station was discontinued at the close of the fiscal year. Geodetic @erafions.--ddvance o f the reconnaissance and friangulatio71 in the southwesternpart o f the State o f New Jersey toward the Delaware'River.-Reference was made in the last arlnual report to the resumption of geodetic operations in the southwestern part of the State of New Jersey, in April, 1892, by Prof. E.A. Bowser, Acting Assistant, and to the delay in his work caused by the destruction soon after completion of a tripod and scaffold 50 feet high at Taylors station. The whole structure was lifted out of the ground on May 6 by a whirlwind which carried i t over a fence, the foot of the posts of the scaffold having been deposited at a distance of 72 feet from the hole out of which it was torn, and pieces blown 400 feet from the station. As soon as practicable, the rebuilding of this tripod and scaffold was begun, and on June 29,it having been completed, Prof. Bowser made the preparations needful for the occupation of the station. Signals having' been erected at Colsons, Lippincott ('92), Pine Hill, and Williamstown, the measurement of horizontal angles was begun at Taylors, and completed on August 17. T h e relative positions of the station occupied in '92 at Lippinkott and the original station of Superintendent Hassler of 1843 having been computed, search was made for the latter point, and it was found at about 1% feet below the surface marked by a frustum of a glazed stoneware cqne, uninjured, the upper and lower diameters being 8 and 14 inches, respectively, and the length 1 4 1 inches. A signal was then put up at Lippincott ( ' 4 3 ) , and the angle at Taylors station between it ant: Colsons was measured. On August 2 9 , the theodolite was set up at station Colsons, and between that date and September 7, angles were measured between Taylors and Lippincott ('43)and Lippincott ( ' 9 2 ) . The old station at Lippincott was then re-marked by sinking the original stone cone to a depth of 4-5feet and setting over it in a foundation of hydraulic cement a granite monument, 3 . 5 feet.long, dressed 6 inches square at its upper end for a length of 6 inches; having the letters "U. S." cut on each of the four sides, and a triangle on top. A full description, with sketch, accompanies the records. After completing a reconnaissance from the line Lippincott-Burden in order to find the the height of scaffold necessary to see Burden from Lippincott, Prof. Bowser suspended field operations for the season, the statistics for which, from its beginning in April to its close, September 13,are as follows: Reconnaissance: Lines of intervisibility determined as per sketch - - - - - - - - 9

Close o f the series o f tidaZ observations a t the aictotmtic gauge station on South Wharves, Philade4hia.The additional tidal data needed for the port pf Philadelphia having been secured by means of a tidal record from the automatic gauge put in operation in July, 1891, on Pier No.54, South Wharves, Philadelphia, it was decided to discontinue the station in March, 1893, and instructions to that effect were sent to Assistant R. Meade Bache, under whose supervision the observations were then in progress. Mr. George B. Thomas served as tidal observer from the beginning of the fiscal year. The survey is indebted to the International Navigation Company for allowing the gauge to occupy its premises without cost to the Government, and for affording every facility for its successful operation.

S u r v e yb f pari o f Reedy Island, DeZaware River, f o r the purposes o f a guavanhite station.-The northern part of Reedy Island, Delaware River, having been selected' by the United States Government as a site for a quarantine station, a survey of it on a large scale was requested by Dr. Wyman, Supervising Surgeon General of the Marine-Hospital Service, and in compliance with this request the Superintendent instructed Assistant Henry L. Marindin to execute the work. After conferring with Dr. Wyman, Mr. Marindin proceeded to Port Penn, Delaware, and organized his party. The island is low and marshy and was found covered with a tangled mass of reeds, from 4 to 6 feet in height, and almost impenetrable. At the first opportunity the reeds were set on fire in numerous places and the ground was thus made comparatively clear. The large scale (1-2 400) on which the survey W ~ made S in order to meet the requirements for the location of piers and hospital buildings rendered the usual mode of procedure with the plane-table depending upon triangulation points unsuitable, consequently a base line was measured 2 000 feet in length and running parallel with the east shore. Stakes fixed at each 100 feet of this base line marked the front ranges. The elevation of the land above high tide was obtained by connecting the Coast Survey bench mark at Port Penn village with a tide gauge on Port Penn wharf, and by simultaneous readings on this gauge and on one placed on the west shore of the island. The greatest elevation of the land above high tide was found to be one foot and two-tenths. The highest tides wash the surface of the island. The area of the land ceded to the United States by the State of .Delaware in 1873,is 39.15acres. It is bounded on the south by two granite posts in an east and west line. Soundings were taken on both the east and west shores far enough out to indicate-the channel depths.

Mr. Marindin has completed his combined topographic and hydrographic sheet and has submitted it, with a descriptive report, for deposit in the archives. f the boundary line between the Statcs o f Pennsylvania and Delaaare.-Under the headSurvey o i n g "Special Operations" is given an abstract of the report of Assistant W. C. Hodgkins, who was assigned to make the reconnaissance and triangulation required by the Joint Commission for the location and marking of the circular boundary between t h e States of Pennsylvania and Dela&are.* Upon the completion of this service in the spring of 1893,Mr. Hodgkins was instructed to hold himself in readiness for duty on the survey of the boundary line between Alaska and , British Columbia.
Survey o f Ifog lslund, Patuxent River Entrance, Maryland, for the purpose o f a quarantine ski#ion.-At the request of Dr. Wyman, Supervising Surgeon General of the Marine-Hospital Service, arrangements were made in March, 1893,for the survey of Hog Island, Patuxent River Entrance; this island having been selected as a quarantine station. Instructions were issued by the Superintendent to Assistant John W. Donn for the execution of the work, which was to include a topographic survey of the island and the hydrography i n i t s immediate vicinity on a scale that would show all the details desirable. After conference with Dr. G. W. Stoner, Surgeon in charge of the Baltimore Station, and Capt. Mitchell, commanding the revenue steamer Crawford, Mr. Donn left for Hog Island March 19, and having been furnished a boat's crew and one officer by Capt. Mitchell, hc began the topographical survey early next morning by measuring the line of the river beach, which was made the base for the remainder of the island work, and for the hydrography of the river immediately adjacent. By 3 o'clock in the afternoon of the 20th the topography of the island was completed, plane-table determinations of the positions of a number of buoys placed along the line of four and a half fathoms having been made, and these with the shore points furnishing data for t h e hydrography. T h e remainder of the day was utilized in making soundings to determine the best position for a pier and wharf. A temporary tide gauge was established and a high and low water observed. T h e range of the tide was very svall, and the low water differed so slightly from the mean level that no reduction of soundings was deemed essential for the purposes of the work. By g o'clock on the morning of March 2 1 the hydrography was finished. During the week the inking of the topographical sheet and the plotting of soundings was completed and the results placed in the hands of Dr. Wyman. T h e land work covered an area of 5 0 acres ; t h e number of miles run in sounding was 5 ; number of angles measured IO, and the number of soundings 300. Scale of the survey 1-4 800. Continyation o f the tidal record at the automatic gauge station at the U. S.Na7y Yard, Wash&gton, D.

1893,has been submitted by Assistant Isaac Winston, who organized the leveling party and began the work. The circuit selected started from the cornenof B street south and New Jersey avenue, and was carried around the Capitol grounds by way of B street south, First street west, B street north, and First street east to the starting point. It presented, therefore, a steep descent, a relatively level stretch, a steep ascent, and a level stretch back to the point of starting. Bench marks were cut for each position of the rods so that the differences of elevation determined at each station of the instrument could be compared with other determinations of these differences when the station was again occupied. T h e methods of observation were those adopted in the standard leveling operations of the Survey. Each observer complete4 a t different times from z to 18 circuits, and ran one-half of the circuits in one direction and the other half in a Teverse direction. T h e officers who took part in the work were those named in the following table: I O circuits, July, 1892. Isaac Winston, Assistant F. A. Young, Subassistant _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 18 circuits, July, 1892. F. A. Young, Subassistant 5 circuits, Aug., 1892.

Mr. Winston began his first circuit July IZ, with level No, 5 and rods I and K in the same condition in which they had been used earlier in the summer i n the leveling of precision across the peninsula of Florida. Leveling was continued from day to day under all conditions of weather until July IO, when the party was transferred to Mr. Young, who bad been attached to Mr. Winston's leveling party in Florida. T h e same leveling rods were used with level No. 5. Mr. Young completed twenty-three circuits, by August 3. Mr. Braid, who had in former years carried forward the lines of transcontinental leveling of precision from Sandy Hook to St. Louis, was then instructed by the Superintendent to take charge of the party. H e began work August 13 with level No. I and rods I and K, and finished one circuit, running a single line forward, then 'ran three more by a simultaneous double line each time, two double circuits forward and one backward. T h e circuits made by Mr. Nelson in August were run with level No. 6, one forward and one backward after this instrument had been re-adjusted. During the same month, Mr. Winston completed five circuits, using rods I and K with an engineer's level by Buff and Berger. Additional circuits were run as indicated in the table, and experiments were made with targets of various construction. Numerous sets of observations were made by different observers to determine the height of the level kept in one position, while the target was moved to a new place after each set of observations, its distance being about IOO metres, and the values of the angle measured varying from zo divisions of the micrometer plus to 2 0 divisions minus. The instruments were then mounted successively on foot plates on the pier in the astronomical observatory i n the grounds near the office, and the rod having been secured in a vertical position by guys a t a point 82 metres distant, ten Sets, of observations were made by Messrs. Braid, Winston, and Young with each of the three levels; the observations being made in the usual manner, except that the recorder read the micrometer. T h e difference in height of the instruments as thus determined by the several observers was then compared with a careful measurement of this .difference by Mr. Fischer, chief instrument maker, and

this comparison led to the discovery of one of the causes of a discordance i n the results on the several circuits. It was found that the collars of the telescopes to levels 5 and 6 had worn unequally so that they were no longer cylindrical. T h e collars were therefore re-calipered in the Instrument Division, and the wyes and striding levels refitted; zylonite reading headdwere placed on the micrometer screws and zylonite bands on the telescopes so that these could be turned in the wyes without touching them with t h e fingers. T h e additional circuits, 26 in all, run by Messrs. Braid, Winston, and Young in November and December with levels 5, 6,and I ' , and rods N and 0,lwere finished December 31,Mr. Braid using level No. I, which had always given results that were satisfactory. From levels 5 and 6 much better results were obtained than those of the earlier part of the season. A field computation of the observations was completed, and the discussion of changes proposed for t h e improvement of the leveling apparatus, led to the preparation of papers bearing upon the subject and to the call of a conference of officers interested on January 17, 1893. A t this conference, held in the office of the Superintendent, there were presefit Messrs. C. A. Schott, R. S. Woodward, G. A. Fairfield, William Eimbeck, 0. H. Tittmann, Andrew Braid, Edwin Smith, J. E. McGrath, Isaac Winston, John Nelson, F. A. Young, A. S. Christie, and E. G. Fischer. Papers were submitted by Messrs. Schott, Woodward, and Eimbeck; a letter was received from Professor Hoag, and a report on the several papers was prepared by Mr. Winston. Notes on the conference were made by the Superintendent, and suggestions looking to methods of greater accuracy in geodetic leveling. Determination o f the positions o f the new Qyht-house at Maryland Point, Potomac River, and o f the Nooper Strait and Sharkje Shoal L~hf-houses.-Instructions having been issued early in December, 1892, t o Lieut. L.K. Reynolds, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Endeavor, to proceed to Maryland Point on the Potomac River and determine by triangulation the position of the new bight-house a t that point, and later, the positions of the Light-houses a t Hooper Strait and Sharkfin Shoal a t the entrance to Tangier Sound, Lieut. Reynolds left Washington December 12, and on completing this work December 18,returned and made due report of it. While still in command of the Endeavor and directing her repairs at t h e Washington Navy Yard, Lieut. Reynolds met with a most painful accident which ended his life in less than twenty-four hours. Both the Navy and the Coast Survey were thus suddenly deprived of the services of an able and gallant officer. H e died February 16, 1893. CompZetion o f ,the fopgraphic ana' hydrographic resurvey o f the Rppomatfox River, Virginia, to ifs junction with the Janlcs River at Cify Point.-Having re-organized his party in compliance with instructions to resume the resurvey of the Appomattox River, Virginia, from the limits of his work of t h e previous season, Assistant C. H. Boyd reached Washington October 18,expecting-to take the field on the zoth, but was met by information that the steam launch loaned by the Navy Department, and the sole reliance of the party for trdnsportation, had broken down. T h e needed repairs took a much longer time than had been anticipated, so that it was not till November 5 that field operations could be begun. T h e shore line was r u n with the plane table from near Gatlings Wharf to join that of t h e James River survey of 1877, near City Point. T h e Old River from Point of Rocks to some distance above the abandoned wharves, formerly known as Port Walthall, was also surveyed ; this is now thrown out of the Petersburg approaches. Soundings were taken from the limits of the preceding summer's work, and a plane of reference determined by a record of tides kept a t Gatlings Wharf, about halfway between Petersburg and City Point. This record was kept u p from November I to December 7, and during three days simultaneous records were kept at the gauge on the Government Wharf in Petersburg, used by Mr. Boyd during the summer, and by the United States Engineers for some years past, Care was taken t o repeat soundings a t all portions of the river where

dredging operations had been in progress, the assistant engineer in charge having kindly furnished a list of these localities. Mr. Boyd acknowledges the great assistance rendered in the work by the steam launch and the fireman loaned by the Navy Department. The recorders in the party, Messrs. C. L. Gardner and George 0. Glavis, served most acceptably throughout the season. Field operations were closed December 8.

Augustinr and at Cedar Keys, Royida.Reference was made in the last annual report to the establishment of automatic tide gauges at St. Augustine, Florida, in March, 1892,and at Cedar Keys, Florida, in April, 1892, in connection with the work of carrying lines of leveling of precision across the Florida peninsula. By means of the tidal records i t was intended to refer the ends of the lines of leveling to the mean sea level of the Atlantic and Gulf respectively. The series of observations at each gauge was kept up for upward of a year, each observer being required once a month to determine the relation between his tide staff and a bench mark near the station with a spirit level. Under the general direction of Assistant Isaac Winston, Mr. C. C. Yates had charge of the gauge at St. Augustine, and Mr. F. V. Moss, at Cedar Keys. Both stations were discontinued in April, 1893. Geodetic leveling.-Line o f precise leuels re-run beheen Sf. Augusfilte n r ~ dCedar Keys.-Under detailed instructions from the Superintendent, Assistant Isaac Winston proceeded in February, 1893, to St. Augustine, Florida, and on the 13th of that month began to run a simultaneous double line of levels of precision from St. Augustine to Cedar Keys. The plan of operations indicated in Mr. Winston's instructions involved the running of two simultaneous lines in each direction instead of a single line in each direction as heretofore. Four measures would thus be obtained instead of two, and as all of the observing was to be done by Mr. Winston personally, additional checks upon errors of reading would be provided for, and such discrepancies as might be due to the work of a less skillful observer would be eliminated. Owing to the lateness of the season, however, it was not expected that Mr. Winston would be able to do more than run two simultaneous lines the entire distance, 216kiloinetres, or 134.2 statute miles. This he accomplished reaching Cedar Keys May 25. Level No. 5 and rods N and 0 were used over the whole line. The line with one rod is entirely independent of the line with the other rod, though the lines join at each bench mark for purposes of comparison. For these purposes temparary bench marks were established at intervals of about one kilometre. During a great portion of the time the atmospheric conditions were unfavorable owing to intense heat and to the quantities of water standing along the route. Much difficulty was experienced by the rodmen in getting a solid foundation for the rod plates, especially in places where the roadbed was made through marshes. Mr. Winston states that the route followed was the same as that of the year before, and that the lines agreed very closely, it having been necessary to remeasure between bench 8.EX. 10-8

marks in but six cases out of two hundred comparisons. He oberves that the simultaneous double line has many advantages over all other methods, and he recommends that its use be continued. Mr. A. B. Turner served very acceptably as recorder during the entire season, and Mr. E. R.Greer m'ost efficiently as rodman. Soon after returning to Washington, Mr. Winston was directed to proceed to Kansas and continue the line of precise levels from Olathe in that State to Van Buren, Arkansas. Completion o f the fopography and hydrography o f fhe Caloosahafchee River, Florida.-The survey of the Caloosahatchee River, Florida, which `had been begun by Assistant Joseph Hergesheimer in 1892, was resumed in February, 1893, by Assistant W.Irving Vinal, and completed from the mouth of the river to Beautiful Island, about 5 miles above the town of Myers. Mr. Vinal reached Myers on January 28, and next day tobk charge of the schooner Spy, the naphtha launch, the boats and other property which had been in storage there. But few repairs were found necessary, and as soon as instruments and supplies had been received, and signals erected and repaired, plane-table work was taken up, and continued throughout the months of February and March. A margin of shore-line topography was delineated from Wyamie Creek to Beautiful Island on the east shore of the river, and from Hancock Creek to Daughtry Creek on the west shore, the marginal topography from the mouth of the river to the points first named having been finished during 1892. A tide gauge having been established on April I, at Myers, and another on April 14,at Harneys Point, about 6 5 miles below, observations were made simultaneously at the two stations from April 14 to April 28. The tidal record at Myers was continued until May 5. Soundings werk begun April 3, the naphtha launch being used when practicable in running sounding lines, and positions determined by double sextant angleq while the sounding boat was at anchor. The hydrography of the river was finished May 8. Mr. Vinal has transmitted to the officea descriptive report to accompany his topographic and hydrographic sheets. Following are some extracts from this report: Within the limits of the survey of 1893, from Shell Point to Beautiful Island, the Caloosahatchee River varies in width from $ mile to 2 miles. At its mouth, and for a distance of 5 miles above Shell Point, that is, as far as Red Fish Point, there are numerous oyster bars, many of which are exposed at a low stage of the river. Up to this point from the mouth the channel is narrow and winding; above it the river increases in width and the channel is quite direct, there being no rocks or reefs and no sudden changes in the depth of the water. At Beautiful Island, the river narrows in width and divides into several channels. It is navigable for small steamers to its terminus in Lake Hickapochee, and by canal to Lake Okechobee. Crossing this lake, these steamers can pass up the Kissimmee River and through a chain of lakes and canals to the town of Kissimmee, in central Florida. The work of draining Lake Okechobee has had a marked effect on the flow of water in the lower river. The main channel, just south of Beautiful Island became so shoal that it was necessary to build a jetty in 1891-'92. This jetty (though unfinished in 1893) had answered, at least temporarily, the purpose for which it was constructed; the scour of the river caused by deflecting barrier being enough to keep a narrow channel open. Myers, formerly Fort Myers, was a military post during the Seminole war, and a garrison was maintained there until 1861. The present settlement was begun in 1867,and the city has now a population of about 800. The richness of the soil in its neighborhood and the almost entire absence of frost offer great inducements to growers of tropical and semi-tropical fruits; these flourish here in great variety and luxuriance.

Toward the end of January, 1893, in pursuance of instructions, having re-organized his party on board the schooner Quick, and repaired the naphtha launch, he took up the topographic and hydrographic survey of Blackwater River. The triangulation which had been carried over Blackwater Bay and to the mouth of the river in the preceding season afforded a sufficient number of points for plane-table work from the mouth of the river upward. The entire topographic survey was made with the plane table, and by February 27 it was completed up to the town of Milton and for 2 miles beyond it. Signals for the hydrography having been erected, this part of the suSvey was begun February 28 and finished March 8.

Mr. Perkins has submitted with his repGrt a scheme of his reconnaissance showing the stations selected and the lines of intervisibility determined. This scheme, which follows the Alabama River, rests upon the dividing ridges on either side, and its six quadrilaterals cover about one degree and three-quarters of latitude, and somewhat more than one degree of longitude. The country is heavily wooded, and the spur ridges hold their elevation with great regularity to within a short distance of the river, so that observing tripods of from go to 1 2 0 feet will have to be used at most points, and in a few instances the trees on intervening Luniber is, however, cheap and plentiful. I ridges will have to be cut. Mr. Perkins reports that the station at Lower Peach Tree, the latitude and longitude of which had been determined in 1857 by Assistants Dean and Goodfellow, was recovered after diligent search, the original marking and description having been carefully made. The transit pier, which was set up in the Public Square at Mobile by the longitude party in 1856, he found to have been undisturbed, and it is proposed to connect both of these points with the present scheme. i There appeared to be but little probability of the survival of any of the old primary points .in Mobile Bay, with-the exception of the one at Fort Morgan at the terminus of the reconnaissance, but the line St. Elmore-Fort Morgan will furnish a base for the western extension of the work through the Mississippi Sound, should that be deemed desirable. Mr. Perkins calls attention to the fact that in spite of topographical difficulties incident to the approach to a flat coast, the size of the figures of the proposed triangulation has been well maintained, and he attributes the thorough knowledge of the country which made this possible to the result, in a great measure, of the careful preliminary reconnaissance made some years ago by Assistant McCorkle, and to the esaminations of a later date by Assistant Tittmann. He states that his scheme comprises 14 poihts, covers 3 500 square miles, and involved the erection of 38 reconnoitering poles varying from 40 to nearly 200 feet in height, and of a tripod and scaffold signal of 40 feet in height. The lines of intervisibility determined, thirty-eight in all, varied from 5 to 38.5 miles in length and aggregated 808 miles, or on an average, 22.5 miles. In tabular form the statistics are: Reconnaissance: Area of, in sqbare statute miles3 500 Lines of intervisibility determined as per sketch submitted - - 36 Number of points selected for scheme .___ 14 Triangulation: Number of signal poles erected - _ _ 38 Days occupied in opening and verifying lines of sight 67 In the earlier part of the fiscal year Mr. Perkins was in charge of a triangulation party in Western Kansas and Eastern Colorado, reference to which is made under a headini in the Middle Division. Mebsurcmcnt of a primary base line in the KanawAa Valley, Bear S t .Albbans, West Virginia.-Prcparations f o r the measurement at the Ofice, and operations subsequent thereto.-In addition to the special report submitted by Assistant R. S. Woodward relative to the measurement of the St. Albans Base, and which is included in Appendix No. 8, Report for 1892,Part 1 1 , he has submitted a general report on the work assigned to him during the fiscal year. At the beginning of July, 1892,he was engaged in the preparation of the new five-metre comparator, set up in the lot south of the Officeof the Survey, and designed by him to furnish a means of making more exact determinations of the length of the five-metrebar No. 1 7 of the iced bar apparatus in terms of the Natipnal Prototype Metre No. 21. Comparisons of these bars were begun July 15 and continued till August 30. In the large amount of

observing and computing required by this work, Mr. Woodward acknowledges the cordial and able co-operation of Mr. John S. Siebert. Efficient service as recorder was rendered by Mr. Orville G. Brown. During the month of September the computations of the comparisons were completed, and, in pursuance of instructions, preparations were made to take the field for the measurement of the St. Albans Primary Base. Assistant E. E. Haskell and Recorders 0. G. Brown and M. V. Safford were ordered to report for duty to Mr. Woodward. Between October I and IO, the line was prepared for measurement, and during the following four days and nights five meanures.of the base were made with the roo-metre steel tapes Nos. 85 and 88. During the latter part o f October a series of comparisons of these two tapes was made, together with some experiments which supplied additional data relative to the effect upon the tapes of varying conditions of temperature. At the close of October the party returned to Washington. During the period between the beginning of November, 1892, and February, 1893, Mr. Woodward was engaged chiefly in revising the computations of the work done with the iced bar and steel tapes on the Holton Base, and in the preparation of the results of that work for the press. In this duty he was efficiently assisted by Mr. M. V. Safford, who also during the same interval computed and plotted the results of the experimental work on St. Albans Base. In the course of this period, Mr. Woodward prepared, at the request of the Superintendent, a paper for the Engineer's Congress of the Columbian Exposition on the recent experience of the Survey in the use of long steel tapes for measuring base lines. He also gave considerable time to the subject of precise leveling, with special reference to the work of Assistant Winston and Subassistant Youqg about the Capitol groupds, and December I he submitted a report upon this work. After February I he was engaged principally in preparing his final report on fhe iced bar and steel tape apparatus, and on the measures made with them on the Holton and St. Albans Bases. (See Appendix No. 8, Report for 1892, Part 11.) During April and May he made a careful examination of the new theodolites, Nos. 145 and 146,with special reference to their accuracy in the measurement of horizontal angles. The large number of observations which this examination called for were made in a temporary observatory erected for the purpose on Meridian Hill, D. C. In the early part of the work Assistant Sinclair aided by measuring the errors of spacing on the circle of No. 145. Gambey repeating theodolite No. 15 was also tested at the observatory. Before the close of the fiscal year Mr. Woodward tendered his resignation as an Assist-. ant, to take effect June 30, and i t was accepted by the Secretary of the Treasury. Compleh'on o f the observatiOm required io connect fhe Kanawha Base Line, Sf, AZbans, West Virginia, wifhthe franscotifimnfal friangulatiotz.-The progress made by Subassistant W. B. Fairfield, who had been assigned to the duty of connecting the Kanawha Base Line near St. Albans, West Virginia, with the transcontinental triangulation was referred to in the last annual report. Three stations of that triangulation having been occupied, further operations'were suspended for the season. In November, 1892, Mr. Fairfield having been instructed to resume this work and carry it to completion, he proceeded from Colorado to St. Albans, and after visiting and inspecting all of the stations, began observations at Ryan Station, November 29. These were finished December 2 2 , but owing to the extreme severity of the weather it was not practicable to get the instrument and tent down and moved to the next station before January 20, 1893, great quantities of snow having fallen during this period, and the Kanawha River being impassable by reason of floating ice. Beginning January 20, at East Base, that station and the remaining ones, West Base, Rogers, and Coal, were occupied in succession, and all the observations needed were obtained by April 3. Mr. Fairfield observes that the winter of 1892-'93 was in all respects the most severe in

The records and abstracts of the work have all been completed and forwarded to the Office.

H. Buchanan, Acting Assistant, continued the selection of stations and the erection of signals for the extension of the triangulation in northeastern Tennessee until July 12, when he began the occupation of station Short, about 14miles south of the Kentucky line and about 75 miles west of the Tennessee and North Carolina boundary. From this point he completed horizontal and vertical measures on stations White Rock, Buzzard, Big Knob, Chimney Top, Big Butt, English, House, Clinch, and McLean. The three stations first named are in Kentucky, and through them was effected a connection with the triangulation of that State. Station McLean was next occupied, and horizontal and vertical measures completed on stations Short, Clinch, House, Melton and Cross in Tennessee, and on stations King and White Rock, Kentucky, and Kentucky Corner on the Tennessee and Kentucky boundary line. A satisfactory connection was thus secured between the triangulations of these two States. Field operations were suspended September IO. In the general conduct of the work, Prof. Buchanan was guided by correspondence with Assistant George A. Fairfield, in immediate charge of State surveys.

R. Hoag, Acting Assistant. These operations, carried on under the general direction of Assist, ant George A. Fairfield, in charge of State surveys, had been interrupted in the preceding November by the advance of winter, Prof. Hoag being at that time engaged in connecting a permanent bench mark on the Minneapolis City Hall with the Snelling Avenue Base by a line of leveling of precision. Upon the completion of this work, June, 25, Prof. Hoag obtained permission from the Superintendent to establish a system of bench marks for the city of Minneapolis. Grading then i n progress made necessary the resetting of the monument at the University azimuth station, and also of the subsurface marks at this station and at Prospect Park. Topographical sketches of these stations, as re-marked,'having been completed, the erection of observing tripods and scaffolds was begun at stations Wabasha, Taku City, Maxville, and Maiden Rock. Horizontal and vertical measures were made at stations Vasa, Wabasha, and Maiden Rock, and Prof. Hoag had expected to complete the quadrilateral by the occupation of station Ellsworth, but owing to unfavorable weather was obliged to postpone observations at this station till the next season.

The stations thus re-occupied were Hopkins, Mound View, North Base, Ramsey, Woodbury, Wallace, Marcotte, and Buck Hill. At Woodbury and Buck Hill, permanent surface monuments were set to replace temporary ones put down when the stations were first. occupied. On June 25, Prof. Hoag began the occupation'of Ellsworth station.

Confimafion o f the franscontincnfal triangulation along or near flufhirty-ninf h paralZeZ in Kansas, and ifs exfension westward foward fhe Ka.rras-CoZorado Sfaie.Zi?ze.-Progress made by the party in charge of Assistant F. D. Granger, engaged in carrying to the westward the transcontinental triangulation in Kansas, was stated in the last annual report. A t the date named, Mr. Granger was occupying Waldo station, in Osborne County, and upon its completion, July 17, the party was moved to station Allen, Russell County. During the remainder of the summer, and until field operations were close$ November 19, the following stations were occupied in the order here named: Fairmount in Barton County; L a Crosse in Rush County; Hays in Ellis County; Blue Hill, also in Ellis County; and Northwest Base, ea@ 94 the town of Russell. After closing work at Northwest Base the party was disbanded, and M r Granger took I up, under instructions, t h e computation of his observations. He remarks that during t h e entire season the weather was quite favorable for observations of horizontal directions, the winds being moderate in strength. T h e prevailing atmospheric conditions were, however. rather under the normal for distinct vision. In April, 1893,having been directed to resume a t a n early date the extension of the Kansas triangulation to the westward, he began operations by the erection of two large tripod and scaffold signals, one 56 feet in height at station Schmidt, and one of 50 feet in height a t station Big Creek. These high tripods were required to see the stations Canyon and Indian Creek, points at the eastern limits of the scheme of triangulation executed by Assistant Perkins in 1891. Two stations, Big Creek in Trego County and Schmidt in Ness County were occupied before the close of the fiscal year. Mr. Granger had in his party, from the beginning of t h e season of 1893,Mr. H.L. Stidham, temporary aid, whom h e found to be an exceptionally capable and excellent observer. Mr. W. N. Wadsworth recorded observations in an acceptable manner.

Lines o f precise leveling r u n from OZafke, Kansas, fmard Fort Smifh, Arkansas.- Assistant Isaac Winston having been assigned to the continuation of the lines of leveling of precision from Olathe, Kansas, a station on t h e transcontinental line of geodetic leveling, toward Fort Smith and Van Buren, Arkansas, reached Olathe on June 17, 1893, and organized a party consisting of Mr. A. B. Turner, as recorder, and Messrs. ,W. G. Mitchell and R. H. McKennon, rodmen. Two of the permanent. bench marks, one, a mark on the foundation of the Courthouse, and the other, a copper bolt sunk into a brick wall, were found undisturbed. They had been established by Mr. Winston i? October, 1891. A third bench mark, established during the same month, a marble post 8 by 8 inches and 36 inches long, buried 3 2 inches in the ground, was found t o have been raised more than 4 centimetres (1.6inches), and upon examination proved t a be unstable. It is surmised that this was due to the action of frost, which in that region sometimes throws down stone fences and raises fence posts. From Olathe t h e route of the levels followed the Kansas City, Clinton & Springfield branch of the Kansas City, Fort Scott & Memphis Railway. T h e method adopted was that pursued earlier in the fiscal year in Florida, i. e., by running a simultaneous double line of leveling, first in one direction and then in a reverse direc,

At the close of the fiscal year 21 kilometres, or a little more than 13 miles, had been run in one drection, and two permanent bench marks had been established. Temporary bench marks were established at frequent intervals when the lines joined. Mr. Winston acknowledges the courtesy shown by Mr. Geo. Nettleton, President and General Manager of the Kansas City, Fort Scott & Memphis Railroad Company, in granting permission to his party to use velocipede cars as a means of transportation over the lines of the road. Progress made up to the close of the season will be stated in the next annual report. Closing of the gap between the series o f primary triungles in western Kansas ana' eastern Colorado, forming part of tAe framcoatinental triangulation along or near the t/ririy-ninfAparaZZeZ.-In pursuance of instructions issued toward the end of June, 1892,Assistant F. W.Perkins proceeded to Wallace County, Kansas, and organized there his party for the resumption of work on the transcontinental triangulation along or near the thirty-ninth parallel. His plan of operations was so laid out as to accomplish the filling in of the gap between this triangulation in western Kansas and that in eastern Colorado, and he, proposed also to make a preliminary reconnaissance for an improved connection between the mountain and plain work in Colorado. The first ten days after his arrival were occupied in visiting the several staiions and putting the signal poles in adjustment. On July 22, he was ready for observations at station Curlew, in western Kansas. Upon the completion of this station, July 28,he transferred his party to station McLane, Kansas. While the observations here were in progress, Subassistant W.B. Fairfield and Acting Aid H. B. von der Trenck were putting up tripod and scaffold signals and adjusting signal poles in advance of the observing party. On August r3, station McLane was finished, and the remaining stations occupied during the season, Arapaho, Monotony, First View, Lands/ .man, and Cheyenne Wells, were all in Colorado. Three of these stations were occupied by Mr. Fairfield. Observations for magnetic declination were made at all of the points occupied, Mr. von der Trenck making these observations at five stations. The reconnaissance in Colorado established the possibility of obtaining better connections between the mountain and plain stations lying between Pikes Peak and the Spanish Peaks in the Rocky Mountain range, and the eastern border of Colorado. On November 20, 1892, final observatio.ns were made at station First View, completing the junction of the two sections of the transcontinental work east and west of that point. Mr. Perkins reports the following statistics of the season: Triangulation: Number of primary stations occupied :7 Number of geographical positions determined 16 Magnetic Observations: , Number of stations at which the magnetic declination was observed - 7 Duty assigned to Mr. Perkins in Alabama later in the fiscal year is reported under a heading in the Eastern Division. Determination o f the longitude line El Paso, Texas-Little Rock, Arkansas, by exchanges o f telegraphic s~nals.-Obserziatiotrs for latitude and the magtietic elements at LittXe Rock.-The longitude line El Paso, Texas-Little Rock, Arkansas, being one of the few lines remaining to complete the primary scheme of longitude determinations in the United States, and of further importance as furnishing an eastern connection for the series of longitudes determined in 1892 for the International Boundary Commission, arrangements were made for its determination early in 1893. The general supervision of this work was assigned to Assistant C.H. Sinclair, with a co-operating party in charge of Subassistant Geo. R. Putnam. The parties left for the field

on February 18,1893, Mr. Sinclair proceeding to Little Rock, where he found khat the foundation of the pier which he had established in 1885 in the grounds of the post office had been undisturbed. Little Rock had been determined in April of that year by exchanges of signals with Galveston, Texas. These foundations were therefore utilized for a pier upon which was mounted transit No. 19, and a temporary wooden observatory was built. At El Paso, Mr. Putnam re-occupied the station of 1892. All preparations for exchanges of longitude signals were completed by February 25. In the first position of the observers, signals were exchanged on the nights of February 27, March 4, 5, and 8, and in their, second position, on the nights of March 11, 12, 13, 15, and 18. The telegraphic circuit was I 071 miles in length, and it was found necessary to use one repeater at Dallas, Texas. Notwithstanding the great length of this line and the fact that part of it was a local wire, but little difficulty was experienced in exchanging signals opring to the constant care of the officers of the Western Union Company. The results of this determination give a check on the position of El Paso, which was known before only through the longitude brought round from the Pacific Coast. This check proved satisfactory in the field results, which show a closing error in a long circuit, involving twelve lines, of about one-tenth of a second of time. Mr. Putnam has accompanied his report by abstracts of results for longitude, for personal equation of the observers, and for the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity. The values of personal equation during periods of three successive years show a constant tendency to diminish, being S P = 0 ~ ~ 1 7 in 6 1891, and oe*ogin 1893. While in Little Rock, Mr. Sinclair determined the latitude of the station by 68 observations upon 17 pairs of stars with zenith telescope No. 6. Mr. Putnam observed for the magnetic elements at a station in the southeast corner of the United States Arsenal Grounds. This location was selected on account of its freedom from all local disturbance. An electric railway which ran in an east and west direction, about mile north of the station, did not have any disfurbing effect. The field computation for three days' observations gave a variaation east of north of 7" oo*3': At El Paso, the latitude and the magnetic elements had been determined the year before. Early in April, Mr. Sinclair was instructed to report to Assistant George Davidson for duty in connection with the survey of the California-Nevada Boundary line, and Mr. Putnam was ordered to report by letter to Assistant 0. H. Tittmann, and hold himsblf in readiness to join the party engaged under his direction in the surveys preliminary to the location of the boundary line between Alaska and British Columbia. Magnetic records continued at fire automatic registering station, HiZZside Ranch, near San Antonio, f fire tnagnefic eZements recorded by the Adit magnetographs, ana' absoZufe Texas.-Dt~erential observations o vatues determined monfirly.-The transfer of the Differential Magnetic Observatory from the Military reservation, San Antonio, Texas, to a station outside of the city limits was referred to in the last annual report as having been made necessary by the great disturbances caused by the system of electric street railways in close proximity to it. Plans having been duly prepared, the work of constructing the new observatory buildings was pushed forward without delay, and on August 2 they were substantially completed. Observations were continued at the old station until September I , 1892; the instruments were then dismounted, and on September 9, their remounting and adjustment in the new station was finished and the photographic records were begun. The site selected for the new station was Hillside Ranch, 5-4 miles northwest from the tower on Government Hill, and in latitude 29' 29' 15-z" north, and longitude 98" 32/ 08.2" west of Greenwich. The records when made aremmmitted to the care of Assistant R. E. Halter, who arranges them in due forni for transmission to the Office. Mr. L. G. Schultz has charge of the station, the instruments, add the observations.

He has submitted two reports, givingfull details relating to the equipment of the observatory, the method of maintaining the continuous differential records, and containing data and computations for determining the scale values and coefficients of the several magnetographs. All records at the station are made according to local mean time as determined at least once a month by observations upon the sun at equal altitudes. Absolute determinations of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were made on the 14th, 15th, and 16th of each month, until November, 1892, when they were made once a week.

All of the records of the routine work of the station are tabulated, duplicated, and corn-' puted and then turned over to Mr. Halter for further reduction; all records of special observations are duplicated and completely reduced and then placed in his charge for transmission to the Office. In accordance with verbal authority given by the Superintendent, preparations were made during June, 1893, by Mr. Schultz, to undertake the study of the earths currents (magnetic). For this purpose a small neatly constructed building was put up to contain the electrical instruments, and placed about I 097 meters southeast from the magnetic observatory. The apparatus provided for carrying on the investigations relating to the action of the earth currents, consists of one Queen D'Arsonval galvanometer ; a Wheatstone resistance box with coils from I to I ooo ohms on each arm, and a standard resistance set, with a range of 1 1 IIO ohms. Reconnaissance for the extension o f the triangulation o f the United States andMexican Boundary along the Rio Grandefrom the Chisos Mountains io Eagle Pass, Texas.-Full details are @veri by Assistant Stehman Forney in the report, with sketch accompanying, which he has submitted relating to the continuation of his reconnaissance for the primary triangu/ation along the Rio Grande to the southward and eastward from the limits which he had reached during the preceding season. Having arranged to communicate at the proper time with the Mexican authorities at Piedras Negras, Mexico, he proceeded to San Antonio, and having purchased there supplies and outfit for his party, he left on February 9, 1893, for the vicinity of Sanderson, Texas, and

44

took up a reconnaissance for a point to connect with the line Chisos Peak-Santiago. Three miles east of Sanderson and one mile north of the Southern Pacific Railroad he found a station on the highest ground in the region and which had been marked by a large pile of stones built by Major Livennore, U. S . Engineers, in 1883. The altitude of this station, Sanderson Peak, was found to be 2 884 feet above the Gulf of Mexico by aneroid barometer. It commands a view of the Carmen, Pic0 Terio, and Pachone mountains, Mexico, and of the Chisos, Santiago, Myer Spring Ridge, Thurston, and San Francisco peaks, Texas. After a series of examinations in the vicinity of Myer Spring, Texas, and again at Lozier, Mr. Forney finally selected a station on the mesa land surrounding Craig Spring, at an altitude of 2 0a5 feet above the Gulf. Tgen proceeding to Porfirio Diaz (Piedras Negras), Mexico, he presented to.the Mexican authorities there the letters which had beep given him by the Department of State and by the Mexican Legation at Washington. These credentiais secured, for himself and party the permission needed to cross the Rio Grande aod continue his reconnaissance on the llexican side. Having selected a station, Pic0 Terio, on the summit of the mountain of that name, 4 700 feet above the Gulf, and marked it by a stone monument, he recrossed the Rio Grande at the old Shafter Ford, and proceeded to Comstock, Texas, on the Southern Pacific Railroad. An extended reconnaissance of the country in that vicinity was then made, and a station selected 6 miles north of Comstock, on the highest point of the ridge; this station was called Comstock Mesa, and its altitude above the Gulf was found to be 2 ooo feet. Moving southeastward from Comstock to San Phillippi Springs, Texas, the Rio Grande was crossed at the ford of Del Rio, and Mr. Forney proceeded with his entire party to the Buro Mountains, Mexico, 47 miles in a direct line from Del Rio, and 78 miles by wagon road. The station he selected was on the highest point of the Buro range of mountains, and is 4 700 feet above the Gulf. I t is marked by a large pile of stones, and in this, as in the other stations similarly marked, a tin box or can wrapped with copper wire was inserted, containing a written notice relating to the objects of marking, with name and description of station, The points subsequently selected for the scheme were as follows: San Phillippi Mesa, on the highland 7 miles north of the town of Del Rio, Texas, and I 400 feet above the Gulf; Las Moras Mountain, a station 4 miles north of Brackettsville, Texas, and I goo feet above the Gulf, marked by an old stone monument built by Major Livermore; and Eagle Pass Mesa, 3 miles east of Eagle Pass, Texas, and 700 feet above the Gulf. At Eagle Pass,Mr. Forney crossed the Rio Grande into Mexico with a portion of his party, and visited Piedras Negras Mesa and Mondova Viejo Peak, with a view of extending the reconnaissance to the southward and eastward from Eagle Pass, but owing to the smoky state of the atmosphere the observations had to be postponed till another season. On April 30, the party was disbanded, and Mr. Forney proceeded to Austin, Texas, to bring up the results of his field work. With regard to the atmospheric conditions during the entire period occupied by the reconnaissance, February g to April 30, Mr. Forney observes that the work was greatly retarded by dust storms and by smoke and haze. It was not unfrequently impossible to distinguish the outlines of mountain ranges at adistance of I O miles. There was not a single day nor portiqn of a day when accurate pointings could have been made on signals or heliotropes over long lines. At the same time, during this and the two preceding seasons of reconnaissance, the nights were remarkably clear, and night signals on long lines could have been used to advantage. He is of opinion, therefore, that when the triangulation is taken up, satisfactory progress will be made if night signals are employed. For the reconnaissance from Eagle Pass to the mouth of the Rio Grande, Army officers, who have been stationed at posts near that part o E the river, state that the best time for observation is from November I to February I .

The country along the Rio Grande, on the Texas and Mexican sides from Sanderson to Del Rio, was found to be extremely rough and broken: the course of the river in many places is between solid walls of granite and limestone, from 100 to 300 feet in height, and so precipitous that it is impossible to get down to.the river bed on foot. As far as developed, from El Paso to Eagle Pass, the scheme of triangulation, covering 550 miles of river line, comprises a system of unbroken quadrilaterals with sides having an average length of 50 miles. Mr. Forney acknowledge valuable assistance and information from the United States Customhouse officials at Eagle Pass, Del Rio, and Langtry. On the Mexican side of the Rio Grande he found the authorities courteous and agreeable.

Progress Sketches No. 2, Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, and Nos. 13 to 16,inclusive, show the localities of field work in the Western Division. A list of Progress Sketches is given at the close of this volume. Resurvey o f the mrih shore o f the etrirance to ,San Francisco Bay front Horseshoe Bay to rode^ Lagoott.-The resurvey of the shore line of San Francisco Bay, for the determination-of changes, which had been begun by Assistant A. F. Rodgers in the spring'of 1887, and which 'had been interrupted by his assignment to other duty in June of that year, was resumed under instructions issued in May, 1892. Mr. Rodgers having been directed to select a period for completing the work that would afford most favorable conditions of weather, and involve not more time and-cost than he had estimated, put his plane-table party in the field on October 8, and was enabled to close field operations on November 5 . That portion of the entrance to San Francisco Bay included in this resurvey, extended from Horseshoe Bay to Rodeo Lagoon, and embraced the shore line with a fringe of topographical detail and the outlying rocks. The shore-line resurvey was much facilitated by the triangulation which Mr. Rodgers had finished during the preceding summer, many points having been thus determined that it would have been impracticable to reach by ordinary plane-table methods. He reports that the comparisons he was able to make with the shore line survey of 1852,indicated no radical or considerable errors and no omissions in the earlier work, notwithstanding the many difficulties incident to its execution at that period. The telemeter for distances in detail had not then superseded the ao-metre chain, and for the copsiderable elevations involved, contour lines 2 0 feet apart were much too small. Hence the earlier

summit elevations did not bear the tests to which they were subjected by the resurvey, although the general formations and topographic details were fairly represented. Following are the statistics reported: Topography: Area of survey in square statute miles 2.25 Length of shore line in statute miles _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 4`5 Beginning o f the survey of the Calzyornia-Nevada Boundary line.-Completion of the series of observations for the variation o f latitude a t San 3rancisco.- Tidal and magnetic work; hydrographic George Davidson submits in his annual report, statements relatezaminafions, &.-Assistant ing to the various operations in the field and in the office of which he has had charge during the fiscal year. Reference t o them is made under the following headings: Caltyornia-Nevada Boundary li,re.-Under instructions, bearing date of April I 7, 1893, Mr. Davidsoq was directed to take up the resurvey of that part of the boundary line between California and Nevada which extends from a point in Lake Tahoe to the Colorado River. T h e general directjon of the field work was placed in his hands, and Assistants C. H. Sinclair and W. B. Fairfield were directed to report to him for active duty. An abstract of Mr. Davidson's report of progress will be found under the heading, "Special Operations." Completion of the series o f observations for the variatiorr o f latitude a t San Fraiuisco.-New method of determining the irregulariiy in one turn o f the micrometer screw, and the relative value of the who& f furm-Reference was made in the last annual report to the completion by Assistant series o Davidson, in August, 1892,of the series of observations for the variation of latitude a t San Francisco, undertaken in co-operation with the work of the International Geodetic Association. All of the observations for latitude and for the value of micrometer made during the `kourse of this work, both original and duplicate, have been forwarded to the Office, and the reductions and discussions of results are making good progress.. Mr. Davidson observes that in the climate of the San Francisco peninsula the atmospheric conditions are very unfavorable for astronomical observations, and especially for the measure of such minute quantities as the irregularity in one turn of a micrometer screw. H e therefore dwised a method of determining the irregularity in one turn of the screw, and the relative values of all the turns, by means of the microscopic projection of the micrometer thread upon a scale a t about a distance of 12 feet. I n devising this method, he acknowledges the assistance of Mr. T. D. Davidson. It admits readily of the measure of twenty-five points i n a single turn with a n accuracy greater than that attainable by astronomical methods and i n a shorter space of time. Mr. Davidson has submitted for publication a description of the method, which appears as Appendix No. g to Part I1 of this annual report. Sausalito Tidal Work.-The automatic tide-gauge station a t Sausalito, San Francisco Bay,. remained i n Mr. Davidson's charge during the fiscal year. H e examined each month's maregrams as heretofore, and transmitted the usual tabulations to the Office. Mr. Frank W. Edmonds referred the tide staff a number of times during the year to the two bench marks with very satisfactory results. T h e tidal pier was injured in a heavy southeaster, December 24,1892, but a leveling immediately after indicated no change in the position of the staff. Time for the record is obtained by transit observations of the sun a t the Lafayette Park Station; Mr. Edmonds observing for error and rate of chronometer, and making out a table of daily corrections for the use of the tidal observer, Mr. Emmet Gray. Tidal Work a t Fort Point.-In September, 1892, in pursuance of instructions, Mr. Davidson placed four new bench marks near the old tidal station a t Fort Point, and Mr. Edmonds made the levelings for their connection with the original bench mark, which was uncovered for this purpose. A report of this work was transmitted to the Superintendent, and its results were communicated with his approval to Col. George H. Mendell, U. S. Engineers. Magnefic observations.-In November, 1892, and in March, 1893,Assistant Fremont Morse, then a member of` Mr. Davidson's party, determined the magnetic elements at the station

Presidio of San Francisco. At the former date he observed on five days for declination, dip, and horizontal force, and on the latter date for three days. These observations are in continuation of a series begun in 1852, and intended to include the period of maximum easterly variation. Tertiary triangulation and tqpography at Port l;os Angeles hear Santa Jkovica, Cdgornia.-In December, 1892, Mr. Ferdinand Westdahl, draughtsman, at the Sub-office, San Francisco, was detailed by Mr. Davidson to make a close hydrographic examination of that part of Santa Monica now known as Port Los Angeles. This work was undertaken at the request and at the expense of the Southern Pacific Company, who had projected an immense wharf and warehouses there. Mr. Westdahl observed two months' tides, reduced and plotted the soundings, and transmitted an original hydrograpliic sheet and tracing to the Office. The company was furnikhed with a certified copy of the sheet. Topography,etc., ai Redondo Beach.-Upon the completion of his hydrography at Port Los Angeles, Mr. Westdahl was directed to make a determination of the wharf, hotel, and shore lines at Redondo Beach, Santa Monica Bay. These points were connected with the old triangulation, the work being done at the request and expense of the Redondo Beach Company, The records and plotting were forwarded to the Office,and a tracing of the sheet furnished to the company. Pacz& Coast Pilot.-Aids to nav&ation, deterrninahbn o f dangers, etc.-Mr. Davidson continued the collection of material for the Pacific Coast Pilot, and has now on hand enough to warrant its early publication as a supplement to the fourth edition to that work. During the year he recommended the placing of a fog signal vessel off the Flattery Rocks, and furnished evidence of the large number of wrecks on the southwest shore of Vancouver Island at the entrance to the Strait of Fuca. He recommepded also that a red arc of the Tatoosh Island Light should be made to cover the area from Umatilla Rock round by the east to the Strait of Fuca. Toward the end of June, 1893, he directed Mr. Westdahl to determine the position of a sunken rock reported in Carmel Cove, California, by the United States Revenue steamer Corwitr. This, having been done, Mr. Davidson's recommendation that a buoy should be placed to mark the danger was approved, and the buoy is now in position. Specialleveling.-By his direction Mr.Edmonds leveled around the United States Appraiser's building to determine whether any settlement had taken place during the year, this being done for the use of Mr. W. G. Crounse, foreman of repairs. Sub-ofice.-Reference to the operations of the Sub-office at San Francisco will be made under the heading (` Sub-offices,"toward the conclusion of this annual report f the primav triangulatr'ono f the coast o f Cahyornia north o f San Prancisco Bay.Continuation o At the beginning of the fiscal year the party in charge of Assistant E. F. Dickins had been in the field since early in May, 1892,and having finished observations at the primary station, Snow Mountain, had advanced toward completion the occupation of stations Fisher and Two Rock, whereby the connection of the tertiary with the main series of triangulation was much strengthened. Observations at these twb stations ha;ving been finished, July 9, Mr. Dickins returned the day after to San Francisco and made the necessary arrangements for the transportation of a portion of his party and outfit by steamer to Humboldt Bay, in immediate charge of Mr. Westdahl, and thence overland to Blocksburg, in Humboldt County, 12 miles from the primary station, Mount Lassic, which was next to be occupied. Mr. Dickins, with his wagon and animals, after reaching Ukiah by railroad, drove to Mount Sanhedrin, where he posted a heliotroper, and then across the country to Cahto Mountain, where he posted another heliotroper, and thence to Blocksburg, where he arrived July 26, and found Mr. Westdahl awaiting him.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The mountain trail from Blocksburg to Mount Lassic Station has a rise of 4 500 feet, and the station is approximately 6 ooo,feet above the sea level. Two days were spent in cutting out the trail and five days in packing the outfit up the mountain. On August 7, Mr. Westdahl was dispatched with five men and the wagon to post heliotropers at the primary stations, Chimise Mountain, King Peak, Taylors Peak, Bear Ridge, and Mad River, all of which were to be observed upon from Lassic. The two heliotropers required at the extremely difficult and almost inaccessible station, Scott Mountain, were posted by Mr. F. W. Edmonds, who was authorized to undertake this arduous service by Assistant Davidson at the request of Mr. Dickins. Observations were begun at Mount Lassic on August 14,and were continued till the latter part of Septe.mber. Much delay was caused by smoke, which for days at a time was so thick that the outlines of ridges only 5 or I O miles distant could hardly be distinguished. Great annoyance was caused by the desertion of the heliotropers at Scott Mountain; the men first employed remained but a short time at their post, and$ two others sent there to replace them deserted also. Observations on all of the stations but this one were completed, and as the deep snow and continued storms made it impossible to get men to go there, field operations were closed and the party was disbanded in October. Mr. Dickins acknowledges the valuable and efficient service rendered by Mr. Westdahl.

During the winter Mt.Dickins was engaged in office duty, and in March, 1893, he was charged with a reconnaissance of the Unuk River, Alaska,in connection with a Canadian party making a preliminary survey of the southeastern boundary of Alaska. Chronometric Zongifudcs Tacoma-Sifka.- Triangula/ion, fopography,hydrography and magnetic abservations at Tacoma andvicini&.-A statement of progress up to June 30, 1892,of the work assigned to Assistant J. F. Pratt at Tacoma and vicinity was presented in the last annual report. This work involved the determination at Tacoma of the errors and rates of the chronometers carried to and from Sitka on the steamer Queen, a resurvey of the city and harbor of Tacoma (triangulation, topography, and hydrography), and the determination of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity. There were seven chronometers carried on the Q i m n in charge of Mr. T. D. Davidson, who compared them twice every day during each trip of the steamer, and they were compared daily with the observatory chronometers at Tacoma and Sitka upon the arrival of the steamer and during her stay at these ports. Two exchanges of chronometer comparisons had been obtained with Sitka before July I . On,her return *from Sitka the Queen arrived at Tacoma on the evening of July 2, and left on the morning of the 6th. Time was observed at Tacoma on the nights-of July I, 2, 3, 5, 6 , and 7 . On this trip, just after leaving the wharf at Sitka, the steamer ran on a rock in the harbor and remained there for five hours, gettingoff at the end of that time on the rising tide. While on the rock great efforts wdre made to back her off, and she was thereby made to vibrate a good deal and jar heavily, a movement which undoubtedly affected the steadiness of the rates of the chronometers. On her next trip, the Queen arrived on the evening of July 1 7 and left on the morning of July 21, time having been observed on July 1 7 , 18, and 19. After the chronometer com-

parisons on'arrival, Mr. Pratt, with the permission of the managers of the Steamship Company, moved the chronometers from the stateroom on the lower deck and far aft near the propeller, which had been originally engaged for them, to a room in anotHer part of the steamer where there was the least jar and vibration. During the remainder of the season the arrivals and departures of .the Queer; with the chronometers were as follows, time being observed on every favorable night before, during, and after the comparisons: August I and 5, August 16 and 20. O n her last trip of the season she arrived September 4. Mr. T. D. Davidson then returned to San Francisco. Mr. Pratt acknowledges the thoroughly competent and efficient service which he rendered in this branch of the work. All of the old triangulation stations on the south end of Vashon and Maury islands and in Commencement Bay, with one exception, having been destroyed, mainly from natural causes, save those on the west side of the bay, which' had been obliterated by the growth of the city of Tacoma, Mr. Pratt was compelled to go back to the line Robinson 11-Dash at the head of Admiralty Inlet as a base of operations. From this base he determined as many points as practicable for such a topographic and hydrographic resurvey of the harbor as would furnish data for the publication of a new chart. Muc delay was caused by the prevalence of a dense blue haze during the months of July, Augu t, and September; hence i t was November 5, before the triangulation could be finished. The astronomical station was connected with the main triangulation of Puget Sound by a determination from the three bases Mason-Gull, Mason-Slough, and Gull-Slough, all three figures being well conditioned. During the continuance of the hazy weather i t became imperative to adopt some expedient to push the topography; accordingly Mr. Pratt measured with wire a base'on a wharf about halfway across on the mud flats and parallel with the water front of the southern portion of the city. This base, 2 050 metres long, extended the entire length of the wharf, and the points for the topography of all the southern portion of the city and at the head of Commencement Bay were determined from it. He &marks that with the exception of the shore line and hachured bluffs along the water front, none of the natural topographical features had been furnished to him; he was obliged, therefore, to recontour the entire area under survey. Streets, docks, and railways had almost entirely changed the shore liqe, so that all of this part of the work was done anew. . O n the evening of December 20, snow began to fall and continued until the ground had been covered to a depth of about z feet; this, with bad weather following, prevented further instrumental work. The hydrography had been advanced in connection with or alternating with the topography, the area covered being a belt along the shore and out to and sometimes beyond the go-fathom curve and continued across from Brown's Point to Point Defiance, including also the channel dredged in front of the southern portion of the city and the Puyallup River up to the first bridge. At the outset of the resurvey, in the spring of 1892, a tide gauge had been established, and continuous records of high and low waters were obtained for six months. This gauge was referred to the datum plane of the city. A magnetic station was selected in Point Defiance Park,'and overlooking the head of Admiralty Inlet, It is so situated tkat the triangulation station Neil Rock can be used as an azimuth mark. Complete sets of observations for declination, dip, and intensity were made on three successive days. Field operations were closed January 7, 1893.

Triatlgulatioion o f the Strait of y u a n de I;uca.-Upon being relieved from duty with the Harbor Line Commis'sion of the State of Washington in July, 1892, Assistant J. J. Gilbert was instructed to take up the triangulation of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. For quarters and transportation of his party, the steamer Gedney, Lieut. Lucian Flynne, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding, was placed at his disposal, Lieut. Flynne being directed to move his vessel to such points as Mr. Gilbert desired, whenever, in his judgment, it would I be safe to do so. The reconnaissance for this triangulation had been made in 1884,by Assistant B. A. Colonna, and Mr. Gilbert was directed to carry the triangulation westward from the line Discovery-Dungeness. On August 2, the necessary signal lumber having been obtained and other preparations completed, the Gedney, with Mr. Gilbert's party on board, left Port Townsend and arrived in the afternoon at Dungeness. The erection of intermediate signals westward from Dungeness was begun the next day. Heliotrope stands were built and heliotropers posted at stations Discovery Island, Beechy Head, Sherringham Point, and Arch Point on the Vancouver Island shore of the strait, and at Slip Point on the opposite shore. The erection of signals and the posting of heliotropers habing been completed to the line Arch Point-Slip Point, about 2 4 statute miles from the entrance to tAe strait, Mr. Gilbert set up the observing tent and mounted and adjusted the theodolite at Dungeness on August 24, in readiness for observations the next day. But from that time till the date of closing field work, there was no favorable weather, The smoke had been collecting all the month, and had now become very dense; the season of fogs had also arrived, and the smoke continued until it was cleared away by the rains. After these began, there was a general prevalence of either cloudy, rainy, or foggy weather. Mr. Gilbert remarks that the observations at any one station, under favorable atmospheric conditions, ought to have been finished in from three to five days, but he was at Dungeness from August 2 4 to September 11, and was then able to complete only the three directions of the main chain of triangulation, the smoke preventing observations on the intermediate signals. The station on Discovery Island was occupied from September 1 2 to October 3, and Beechy Head between October 5 and 21. The smoke had then been cleared away by the rains, but the fog was very persistent, and the observations obtained were chiefly those of directions in the main chain of triangulation. On two or three cloudy days, however, when the atmosphere was remarkably clear, all of the intermediate signals were observed,

At each of the stations occupied, observations were made on several days with the declination compass for the magnetic variation. Measurements of vertical angles were made on many of the mountain peaks and on some of the heliotropes. Field operations were suspended for the season and the party disbanded October 28. On November I, in compliance with instructions previously given, Mr. Gilbert again reported for duty to the State Harbor Commission. Reference to his service with this Commission will be found under the heading " Special Operations." Mr. Gilbert remarks that the plan he adopted of having heliotropes at the principal stations of the triangulation with a number of intermediate stations of large size was the best available, but that the months most favorable for observing would be June and July, and the next best, April, May, and August, although i n April much stormy and cold weather is apt to be encountered. He expresses his high appreciation of the uniform courtesy and ready co-operation of Lieut. Flynne, commanding the Gedney, and the officers associated with him.

37 During the winter of 1892-'93, and unti! January 15, Mr. Gilbert was employed in finishing the maps of hQ surveys of Port Angeles, Anacortes, and La Conner for the State Harbor Commission, and in laying out the harbor lines, etc. Returning to his regular duties on the Coast and Geodetic Survey after having been relieved from service with the Commission, he finished the preparation for the archives of all outstanding original records, sheets, and computations, and then prepared to resume the triangulation of the Strait of Fuca. O n May 15, he left Olympia to join the steamer Gedney at Port Townsend, and on May 22, as soon as water, coal, and lumber had been got aboard, left in her for his working ground. Field operations were begun by building signals from Clallam Bay to Cape' Flattery on the south side of the Strait, and from Sherringham Point to Bonilla Point on the north side, and clearing lines of sight. A thorough examination of Flattery Hill, and other hills between Neeah Bay and Cape Flattery, having convinced Mr. Gilbert that there wasco point which could be made to see both Tatoosh Island and Slip Point, he abandoned, though reluctantly, all attempts to select a station in the hills, and decided to occupy a station at Waadah Island and another at Classet Village Point, in order to reach Tatoosh Island. The intermediate signals were then built; four concrete piers were constructed; heliotropers were stationed at Discovery Island and Slip Point, and on June 26, 1893, observations were begun at Beechy Head. These were completed, the weather being.favorable, on June 29, and at the end of the fiscal year Mr. Gilbert was making preparations to occupy station Striped Peak, on the south side of the Strait and nearly oppcbite Beechy Head. Statements of progress later in the season will appear in the next annual report.

to be determined a t t h e station in the park, the location of which was near the shore of Yellowstone Lake, about half a mile northeast of the Lake Hotel. All of this work having been dompleted just before the end of July, 1892,a full abstract of the reports of Messrs. Sinclair and Putnam was included in the annual report for that year. Coiztinuation o f the transcontinentaltriairgulation in the vicz'j2ityo f the thirty-ninth paraZZeZin northern a n d eastern Utah.-The report submitted by Assistant william Eimbeck presents a comprehensive view of the extension of the primary triangulation assigned to his charge in northern and eastern Utah during the fiscal year 1893. His operatioris have materially advanced the work yet remaining t o complete the chain of transcontinental triangulation along or near the thirty-ninth parallel. At the beginning of the fiscal year Mr. Eimbeck's .party was encamped a t Promontory station near the shore of Great Salt Lake. This is a principal point in the net of triangulation which connects the primary base line near Salt Lake with the main triangulation a t Ogden and Pilot peaks. Owing to the importance of this station, the work executed there was made as complete as that usually accomplished a t stations of a primary order; hence, it was not until July 2 0 , 1892,that all of the observations were completed and the transfer of the party and equipments to Pilot Peak station .begun. This point had been occupied in 1889; its re-occupation (and also that of station Deseret) was made necessary by the final location of the Salt Lake Base. This transfer and the observations needed for the extension and perfection of the horizontal direc\ions and zenith distances occupied the party nearly a month. Occasion was taken also to perfect the geodetic connection of the State boundary between Utah and Nevada, and to extend the same'northward t o Tecoma and the substantial granite monupent which marks the intersection of the boundary with the Central Pacific Railroad. T h e occupation of five second-order points was involved in this incidental work. Mr. Eimbeck observes that as no standard parallels have as yet been established in the vicinity of the Tecoma and the Pilot Peak range-of mountains by the surveys of the General Land Office, the connection referred to must be regarded as fixing the position of the boundary i n longitude only. T h e one monument, the latitude of which was closely determined, is the granite one at the Central Pacific Railroad intersection. On the completion of the work a t Pilot Peak and vicinity, the party next proceeded to station Deseret by way of Ogden, Salt Lake City, and Stockton, Utah, traveling a distance of over 300 miles, alternately by' wagons and by rail. , ' T h e lower camp, near the eastern base of the mountain, was reached on August 27, and as the pack trail which had been opened during the season of 1887 was still in a passable condition, the party was enabled without further delay to enter upon the preliminary work of packing the instruments, equipments, etc., u p the mountain; and having established an upper camp, the station was soon after prepared for occupation. This upper camp it was necessary to pitch fully a thousand feet below the triangulation station, the altitude of Deseret Peak being nearly I I zoo feet, and its sides extremely precipitous and rocky. T h e work requi,red to be done a t Deseret was extensive and complex, including determinations of the astronomical latitude and of the azimuth of the reference directions, etc., and its completion was not accomplished until September 20. Since the weather in this part of Utah remains usually open and favorable for field work till about the middle of November, it was decided, with the approval of the Superintendent, to occupy one more station before closing operations for the season, namely, Antelope station, situated upon the principal peak of Antelope Island, in the Great Salt Lake of Utah. All arrangements having been completed for the transfer of the party across.the lake to the island on September 29,camp was established near t h e summit of Antelope on October 6,and t h e instruments mounted and protected in readiness for observations. These were all completed by October 27, except the determinations of astronomical azimuth. By that date the

weather had. become exceedingly inclement, and it was deemed advisable to break camp and convey the party to Salt Lake City. A t all of the stations occupied during the season the work involved observations of horizontal directions and zenith distances, determinations of latitude and azimuth, and of. the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity. Much attention was given, whenever practicable, to the perfection and extension of the subsidiary system of triangulation points, it being obvious that the careful determination of these secondary points in geographical position will greatly facilitate the execution of such local or topographical surveys as may be c9lled for in the future. Mr. Eimbeck acknowledges the efficient services rendered in his party by Assistant P. A. Welker and by Recorders 0. B. French and R. L. Faris, all of whom upon the disbanding of the p a r t r early in November returned east to their respective homes, and took up, under instructions, the preparation of the records and computations for the Archives. Messrs. Welker and French were detailed early in January, 1893, for duty on the coast of Florida. Mr. Faris remained attached to the party during the winter, occupied chiefly with the field reductions and computations. He also made under Mr. Eimbeck's immediate direction, a t the magnetic base station a t Washington, a complete set of observatidns for determining all of the constants of theodolite magnetometer No. IO, which had been provided with a set of new w g n e t s , and undergone other modifications in point of construction. This magnetometer had been used for all the magetic work done in Utah and Colorado. With the aid of Mr. H. B. von der Trenck, Mr. Eimbeck personally determined the index correctiohs for a number of new compass declinometers. Early in May, upon t h e receipt of instructions directing him to resume field work i n Utah, Mr. Eimbeck proceeded to Salt Lake, and after having been jbined by Mr. Faris, charged him with the duty of occupying City Creek, a station in the geodetic cpnnection of the telegraphic longitude station in Temple Block, Salt Lake City, with the main triangulation, T h e observations a t City Creek, begun May 30, were finished June 6. When joined later on by Assistant John Nelson and temporary Aid C. C. Yates, Mr. Eimbeck made arrangements for the occupation of the telegraphic longitude station to connect it geodetically with the main spires of the Temple, and to determine a primary astronomical azimuth. T h e hypsometric work of the triangulation was also connected with a permanent bench mark established upon the foundation walls of the Great Temple. Through the spirit leveling executed by the authorities of Salt Lake City, their bench mark is connected with the railway levels a t the Union Pacific and Rio Grande Western depots. T h e old magnetic station was also re-occupied and referred through a full set of observations to a new station established in the grounds of the University of Utah, about a third of a mile further to the westward. Owing to the proximity to the old station of the large quantities of iron and steel used in the construction of the Temple, and to the stretching of many electric street railway wires and electric light wires, its transfer to a point free from their influence became necessary. Upon the completion of the work a t Salt Lake City, Mr. Eimbeck began the arrangements and preparations needful for the occupation of Mount Waa4, a main triangulation station loFated upon the northernmost Icing Peak of the La Sal range of mountains. This peak ,is about 31.5 miles south of the thirty-ninth parallel of nQrth latitude, and g miles west of the boundary line between Utah and Colorado. I t s height above sea level is approximately 1 2 600 feet. On June 14the party proceeded to Moab, a sinall Mormon settlement situated in eastern central Utah, and thence 2 5 miles up the western slopes of the Sierra La Sal. During the remainder of the, month, up to the close of. the fiscal year, all equipments, materials, etc., were hauled over about 50 miles of rough mountain road to the Lower Camp, and about 5 miles of pack trail were located and opened through steep, rocky, and timbered slopes to th'e summit of the peak.

Commander W. I. Moore, U. S . N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Patterson, having completed the survey of Boca de Quadra, southeastern Alaska, had begun the triangulation of Keku Straits, a narrow channel which connects Sumner Strait with Frederick Sound, between Kupreanoq and Kuiu Islands. This channel, locally known as "Rocky Pass," is much incumbered with rocks and islands. The Patterson had found an anchorage at the south end of Conclusion Island, and was joined there by the steam launch Fuca. This anchorage Lieut. Commander Moore named Seclusion Harbor. There a tide gauge was established and parties were sent thence to recover stations and build signals on Sumner Strait. On July 5, 1892, a party with Ensign Howard in command was sent to prosecute the hydrography in the Narrows of Keku Straits, this locality being inaccessible to steam launches. On July 7, this party measured a secondary base in the Narrows, its length being 156.1 metres. On July 14,a primary base line was measured in the southern entrance to Keku Straits, the accepted length being 3 534.06 metres. On July 25, Ensign Tarbox was dispatched in the 'steam launch Fuca by way of Wrangell Strait, to recover stations and build signals in Frederick Sound. On July 2 7 , tlie Patterson, having left Seclusion Harbor the day before, anchored for the evening in Security Bay, Chatham Straits, and next day Lieut. Commander Moore sent Ensign Howard in the steam launch Vixen to reconnoiter for an anchorage in Hamilton Bay. On the 2gth, piloted by Ensign Howard, the Patterson proceeded to Hamilton Bay; next day Ensign Poundstone was sent to occupy the astronomical station at Cape Fanshaw; the triangulation of Keku Straits was continued, and, on August I, Camden astronomical station was established. On the 2d, the ship was moved to an anchorage on the north side of Hamilton Bay, where a tide gauge was put up, and on the 4th the tide gauge in Eliza Harbor was re-established. A primary base line from Station Can to Station Eva was mqasured on August 9,its accepted measurement being 4 52o*ogmetres. The Fuca, with Ensigns Howard and Tarbox, was sent on August 13 to execute the hydrography of Port Camden. O n September 5, the Patterson was moved from Hamilton Bay to Security Bay, where a tide gauge was established, and from this anchorage as a base of operations, the surveys of Saginaw Bay and Security Bay were proceeded with, and also the hydrography of Frederick Sound. Measurement was made September 1 1 of a check base in Security Bay from station Way to station Tear, the accepted measurement being I 812.04 metres. On September 19, the survey of Security Bay having been finished, field operations were closed for the season.

Lieut. Commander Moore observes that owing to the prevalence of fogs and high winds but little hydrographic work could be done in Frederick Sound, and the same unfavorable conditions retarded the progress of the triangulation. His report is accompanied by full descriptions of the hydrographic characteristics of the localities of his surveys, with sailing directions and notes of dangers. The following named officers were attached to the party during the season of 1892: Lieut. C. W. Jungen, U. S. N.; Ensigns H. C. Poundstone, W. L. Howard, F , L. Chapin, and Glennie Tarbox, U. S. N.; Passed Assistant Surgeon C. J. Decker, U. S. N., and Assistant Engineer T. F. Carter, U. S. N. Messrs. H. L. Ford, J. J. Gensoul, and W.G. Appleton served as recorders and draughtsmen.

Commander Moore was engaged in office work. On November 30, the Pattrrson was taken to the Union Iron Works for repairs to her boilers, and in January to the Mare Island navy yard for miscellaneous repairs to her engines and boats. Early in April, upon the receipt of instructions for the resumption of his surveys in Alaska, and for the transportation of the Alaska Boundary parties to their respective destinations, Lieut. Commander Moore prepared the steamer for the season's cruise, and on April 13, 1893, left San Francisco for Port Townsend. On the 26th, the Patterson was ready to leave Departure Bay, British Columbia, in company with the steamer Hassler and with the schooner Earnest in tow. She then proceeded to Port Simpson, British Columbia, where the steam launch Cosmos, after having been made ready for service, was taken in tow, and leaving Port Simpson May 3, the Patterson anchored in Burroughs Bay, where stores were landed and an observatory built for one of the civilian parties. Upon leaving Burroughs Bay May 5, the steamer proceeded to Fort Wrangefl, whence a party was dispatched in the Cosmos to reproduce the shore line of Security Bay. T h e next anchorages of the Patterson were in Holkham Bay and in Taku Inlet. A t this inlet, on May 11, stores were landed and a storehouse and observatory built for one of the civilian perties. From Taku Inlet the steamer proceeded to Juneau Harbor; thence to Peril Stratts, and

thence to Sitka Harbor, where she was anchored alongside the government wharf on Japonski Island, and preparations at once made for beginning the survey of the harbor and approaches. On May 16,a tide gauge was put up and triangulation begun; on the 22d two base lines were measured, one of 4 430.25 metres, and one of I 263'21 metres, and from that date the survey was pushed forward at every opportunity the weather would ,admit of. At the end of the fiscal year all of the operations incident to a general survey were in active progress. Lieut. Commander Moore has submitted a statistical report, covering the period from May 17 to June 30, 1893,in advance of his general report of the work of the season. The statistics are as follows: Base lines: Primary, length of in metTes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -. - 4 430.25 Secondary, length of in metresI 263.21 Triangdation: Area of, in square statute miles - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .___ ' 3 5 Hydrography: 60 Area sounded in square geographical miles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 661.6 Number of miles (geographical) run while sounding _____.

Hydrographic and gencraZ surveys in Dixon Enfrance, CZarence Slraif, and AeviZZag&edo ChameZ, southeasfern Alaska.-In compliance with instructions issued in March, 1892,Lieut. W. P. Ray, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer McArfhur, had reported to Lieut. Commander W. I. Moore, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Pafh-son, and as directed by him, had proceeded with the triangiilar tion, shore-line survey, and hydrography required in Dixon Extrance, Clarence Strait, and Revillagigedo Channel, southeastern Alaska. Until June 21, Lieut. Ray had the use of the steam launch ,Fil,ca, his own ship having been temporarily disabled in May, but as soon as her repairs were completed the launch was turned over to Lieut. Commander Moore. For want of a launch later in the season he was unable to complete all of the hydrography laid out upon his projection, but reports that but very little additional work is required for all practical purposes, with the exception of locating Chacon Rock. This rock, 3 miles south of the boundary line between Alaska and British Columbia, was the only danger in the paths of commerce not located on the sheet. Bad weather toward the end of the season compelled the postponement of the work needed to develop it, The surveys completed extended from Cape Fox, southeast Alaska, in longtitude 130' 51' west to the meridian of 131' 41'west, and from the boundary line north through ,Revillagigedo Channel to the parallel of the Twin Islands in latitude 5 5 O IO' north, in the eastern portion of the projection; in the western portion, north to Clarence Strait, Percy Islands, and beyond the limits of safe or desirable navigation. The south shore of Duke Island can only be sounded from a boat. The two dangers in Dixon Entrance near the boundary line, viz, East Devil Rock and West Devil Rock, were carefully located and developed. Lines of soundings were run at right angles to each other I mile apart in deep water, and in localities that were free from dangers. Over the extensive banks, rocks, and reefs mile distances, and at closer dissouth of Duke Island, lines were run at 5 mile and tances when needed. From three to seven casts of the lead were taken in deep water, and oftener over shoals and around dangers.

T h e shore line and topography from Duke Point to the north end of Mary Island was carefully done by sextant on a scale of 1-10 000,and the close hydrography within the same limits, including Duke Harbor, Morse Cove, Reef Harbor, and Danger Passage. Lieut. Ray observes that he gave the name Duke Harbor to the bay leading into Morse Cove, and that it proved to be the best anchorage within the .limits of his surveys, having from ten to thirty fathoms water, good holding ground, and excellent protection from all southerly storms. A good channel was found through Danger Passage, and the mail steamers now use it, as it shortens the distance to the Customhouse a t Mary Island. T h e triangulation was done by Ensign H. George, and is believed to be very accurate. It began at North Base Station, Mary Island, and was carried south through Revillagigedo Channel and west through Dixon Entrance to West Rock and Percy Islands; all exposed rocks were occupied, and readings with the theodolite taken to all principal peaks and prominent objects. Field operations were continued until September 23, a t which date the McArfhur joined the Pattersotr on her return to Port Simpson. T h e officers attached to the party of Lieut. Ray were Ensigns C. P. Eaton, Harry George, and E. T. Witherspoon, U.S. N., and Assistant Engineer W. C. Herbert, . U. S . N. Messrs. R. J. Crowley and W. S. Allen served as draughtsmen and recorders. T h e statistics of the season, beginning May IO and ending September 23, 1892, are as follows : Triangulation: Area of, in square statute miles 563 Number of signal poles erected - - - - - - - - - _ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 94 26 Number of observation tripods and scaffolds built - - - - - - - - - - - - 26 Number of stations occupied for horizontal measures- - - - - - - - - - - - Number of- stations occupied for vertical' measures- - - 1 - _ _ - - _ _ _ - 71 Number of geographical positions determined -- - - - - -----36 Topography: Length of general coast line in statute miles _-____ 33-5 Hydrography : Area sounded in square geographical miles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 423 Number of miles (geographical) run while sounding- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - I 330'2, Number of angles measured ___ _ _ __ _ _._ _ _ _ _ _ _ 5 584 Number of soundings-__ _ _ _ - - - - - - - - --_ - --- - - - - - - 1 0 787 Number of tidal stations- - _ _ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - _ _ _ _ _ _ __ 3 Number of current stations- - - - -- - .- - - - - - - - _ _ 3 T h e general hydrography was plotted on a projection scale 1-80 000; in addition to this there were two subsheets each on a scale of 1-10 000. After returning to San Francisco, Lieut. Ray took up the preparation of the records and results of his work for the archives of the Survey, but owing to faillng health, h e was ordered in the spring to the Naval Hospital, Mare Island, where he died on June 9,1893. His loss is much regretted as that of an officer who had rendered faithful and efficient service in charge of hydrographic work on the Pacific Coast since July, 1891.

Tacoma-Sitka and Sitka-Yakutat, by comparison of chronometers transported by the steamers Queen and Hassler; these steamers having met a t Sitka, on June 11, after trips from their respective ports, and again toward the end of the month. T h e steamer Queen made in all six trips, two each month, between Tacoma and Sitka. T h e commander of the HassZei- had been instructed t o meet the Queen a t Sitka each trip, bringing his chronometers from Yakutat Bay. On the arrival of each steamer, her chronometers were compared by Mr. Morse with those of his observatory. ' T h e last trip of the Queen was made in the latter part of August. She left Sitka on her return t r i p August 28, and Mr. T. D. Davidson, recorder in Mr. Morse's party, who had taken charge of the chronometers on board of her, left for San Francisco. The Hassler made one more trip t o Yakutat after t h e Queen had completed her six trips, and returned to Sitka with the party of Assistant McGrath, on September 6. Mr. Morse had obtained time observa'tions on t h e gd, and as the weather had been adverse since that date, h e kept his instrument mounted till he got one more night, which was not till the 10th. This completed the time and longitude work for the season. Reference will be found under the next heading to the independent determinations of the magnetic elements by Messrs. McGrath and Turner, made between September 7 and 14, at the two stations which had been occupied by Mr. Morse in May and June. T h e results which he obtained were confirmed by those of his colleagues. Mr. B. H. Randolph served acceptably throughout the season as recorder a t Sitka. Mr. Morse ackhowledges the many acts of kindness and courtesy extended to his party by Mr. Hatch, Collector of Customs a t Sitka, and by his deputy, Mr. Isham ; also by Judge R. C. Rogers, United States Commissioner. Through Mr. Hatch, permission was obtained for the occupation by t h e party of a room in the old " Castle," or Governor's residence, as an office. After his return to San Francisco, October 3, Mr. Morse took up the computation of his observations and the preparation of his records for t h e archives. I n December, h e was instructed to report to Assistant Davidson and give him such assistance as was needful in computation. In April, 1893, h e left for Sitka, having again been assigned to duty as astronomer a t that station in connection with the Southeastern Alaska Boundary Survey. It was arranged that the steamer Hassler should transport chronometers from t h e three astronomical stations to be established on the Taku, Stikine and Unuk rivers, southeastern Alaska. Mr. Morse took passage for Sitka in the Hassler, and upon arriving a t Port Townsend, Mr. H. C. Lord, who had been detailed to take charge of the chronometers while ili transit, came on board and reported for duty. ' T h e party reached their destination May 15. Work was a t once begun on the temporary observatory, and on the evening of the 16th observations for time were obtained. These have been since continued on every favorable night. A Stierle self-registering tide guage was forwarded with the instruments for the Alaska parties, and by supplementary instructions, Mr. Morse was directed to set it up a t Sitka and obtain acontinuous tidal record. He found it necessary to build a section of wharf for this purpose, and the beginning of the record was also delayed till June 2 7 , in order to repair the gauge clock. Three permanent bench marks were established and referred by spirit leveling t o the zero of the tide staff. Subsequent progress will be stated in the next annual report.

manding the steamer Uassler, and between May 19, the date of arrival of the steamer in the bay, and July I, a site for a base line had been selected and the base measured: a temporary observatory built on Khantaak Island; a scheme of triangulation had been laid out; observations of horizontal and vertical angles begun, and those for latitude, azimuth, and the magnetic elements were making active progress. A sketch showing the triangulation asdeveloped from the base measured on the western shore of Yakutat Bay, and the positions of the stations from which Mount St. Elias was determined is appended. All of the observations in the vicinity of the base line were finished on August 1 2 , and on the 13th the party was transferred to the beach on the east side of the baf a t the base of Mount Hoorts, preparatory to the occupation of that station. ' A flying camp was established on the mountain top, and on the 17th, the first day thereafter of a clear atmosphere, observations of horizontal and vertical angles were begun. By the Igth, these and the magnetic observations were completed; the station was marked on the 20th, and the instruments carried down the mountain in a heavy rain. This continued until August 23; the main camp was then struck, and the party went aboard the Uassler and were taken to Ocean Cape at the eastern entrance to the bay. T h e station here was prepared for occupation, and the theodolite mounted, but it was not till the 29th instant that any signals or other objects could be seen. On September 2, observations a t Ocean Cape having been completed, t h e party.boarded the Uassler, and on the 4th t h e astronomical observatory was dismantled, Assistant J. Henry Turner, who had had charge of it having finished all of his observations. On the night of the 4th, the steamer left for Sitka, reaching that port on.the morning of September 6. Reference to the chronoinetric trips of the Uassler to Sitka is made under the heading immediately preceding. I n accordance with instructions, Mr. McGrath, upon returning to Sitka, set UP a magnetic tent in the Parade Ground and mounted and adjusted a magnetometer. On September 7 and 8, independent sets of observations were made by him and by Mr. Turner. A station was then selected on Japonski Island, Sitka Sound, where magnetic observations had been made in 1880 by the party of Assistant Dall, and again by Sub-assistant Fremont Morse in June, 1892. Both at Sitka and on the island, the true meridian was determined by Mr. Turner by observations of solar azimuths. Independent sets of magnetic determinations were made on the island station by Messrs. McGrath and Turner on September 12 and 13; and on the 14th observations were made to determine the index error of the compass declinometer which had been used a t the stations of the triangulation around Yakutat Bay. On September 18, thefUassler left for San Francisco, stopping at Port Simpson, a t Departure Bay, and at Port Townsend, and reaching her destination October 12. Mr. McGrath expresses his appreciation of the valuable aid rendered by Lieut. Harber and the officers of his party; their hearty co-operation c o d d always be depended upon. Mr. Turner's skill and experience as an observer, and his previous service in charge of a field party in northern Alaska, contributed greatly to the success of the field operations. H e has submitted a special report relating to his astronomical work. A thorough search having failed to disclose any traces of the astronomical station occupied in 1874 by the party of Assistant Dall on Point Turner, he established a new station farther u p the beach and near the crest of the low bank on the seaward side of the point. I n addition to the observations for time, latitude, and azimnth, Mr. Turner observed a solar azimuth early in the season for the use of the hydrographic party, and ran a few miles of shore line for its use. In the vicinity of the astronomical station he made a small triangulation to connect it satisfactorily with the main scheme, and introduced as a check the short base measured by the hydrographic party on Khantaak Island. Magnetic observations were made on September I, 2, and 3. Messrs. A. L. Baldwin and R. J. McAdory rendered acceptable service as recorders. Their zeal and energy are heartily acknowledged by their chief.

During the winter of 1892-'93, Mr. McGrath was occupied at the Office in Washington, D. C. in the reduction of his results and in the preparation of his reccrrds for the archives, and in March he left for the Pacific Coast, under instructions to take charge of one of the parties organized for obtaining such information and data as would enable the duly appointed Commissioners to establish a boundary line between Alaska and British Columbia. , Hydrographic surveys in Yukufat Bay, Alaska.-Reference was made in the last annual report to the progress of the hydrographic surveys in Yakutat Bay, Alaska, up to July I, 1893,'by the party in charge of Liedt. Giles B. Harber, U. S . N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, Commanding the steamer Nussler. The results of these surveys are fully stated in the two reports submitted by Lieut. Harber, one being his general report of operations during the season, and the other a descriptive report to accompany his hydrographic sheet.

De Monti Bay and vicinity was found t o be the only portion of Yakutat Bay which afforded quiet and safe anchorages; and the development of its hydrography with that of its adjuncts, Port Mulgrave and Rurik Harbor, occupied what remained of the season after the beginning of the fiscal year. A plane of reference for soundings was derived from a month's observations of a tide gauge set u p a t Port Mulgrave where the water was always smooth. On August 14 and 15, a careful search was made for the Pamplona Rocks, supposed to be near Port Mulgrave, but without success. I n his descriptive report Lieut. Harber gives full details with regard to the hydrographic characteristics of Yakutat Bay, which is a deep and wide indentation of the coast, opening into that portion of the North Pacific Ocean' known as the Gulf of Alaska. These details will have much value in the compilation of a new edition of the Alaska Coast Pilot. T h e great Malaspina Glacier descends t o within about 4 miles of Point Manby a t the western entrance t o the bay. I n front of it are masses of bowlders and glacial debris, through crevasses i n which the ice is in many places clearly seen during the latter part of the summer. Field operations were suspended for the season September 2, and on the 4th the Hassler left for Sitka, having previdusly taken on board the parties of Assistants McGrath and Turner, who had been engaged in the triangulation, spirit leveling, and latitude, longitude, and azimuth work. The officers attached to the party of Lieut. Narber were Lieuts. H. S. Chase, and J. B. Blish, U. S. N.; Ensigns L. J. Clark, J. G. Doyle, and Benj. Wright, U. S. N., and Assistant Surgeon G. T. Smith, U. S. N. Master-at-Arms C. W. Fitzgerald served as draughtsman, and G. S. Gregson as recorder. a For the season the statistics are: Hydrography: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 787 Number of miles runsin sounding _ _ __ _ _ _ _ - _ _ - 3 879 Number of angles measured-- - - _ _ . _ _ _ _ _ - _ _ - _ _ _ - _ _ _ . ___ - - - - -* - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 5 468 Number of soundings- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - During t h e winter of 1892-93, the Hasskr was under repair a t the dock of the Union Iron Works, San Francisco, and i n the spring Lieut. Harber was directed to prepare her for service in co-operation with the parties assigned to the survey of the boundary between Alaska and British Columbia. After having received on board members of the civilian parties, the Hnssler left San Francisco for Port Townsend, April 12. Arriving a t Port Townsend on the 17th, Lieut. Harber, i n compliance with telegraphic instructions went to Tacoma, where he received from Lieut. Lucian Flynne, U. S. N., the steam launch Fuca and the schooner Zarnest, intended for the use of t h e Alaska parties, and on the 21st h e sailed for Wrangell, Alaska, by way of Victoria, Departure Bay, and Port Simpson, British Columbia. Upon reaching Wrangell, May 2, he built a storehouse and observatory for Subassistant Putnam, and moored the Earnest inside Etolin Harbor. After landing stores and the parties in charge of Assistants Tittmann and Pratt, h e proceeded to Taku Inlet, and having made some needed repairs to the Rum,returned her to Assistant McGrath's party at Taku, and then proceeded t o Sitka. Here h e built a temporary observatory for Assistant Morse, and on May 18 left for Taku Inlet, Wrangell and Burroughs Bay t o compare the chronometers carried on the' Hassiey with those a t t h e observatories established at those points. Between June 6 and June 11, and between June 15 and 23, the steamer made round trips between t h e above named stations and Sitka. Progress after June 30, 18\93, will be stated in the next annual report. During the season of 1893, the following named officerswere attached to the party under command of Lieut. Harber: Lieut. C. F. Emmerick, U. S. N.; Ensigns, L. J. Clark, C. P. Eaton, and W. S . Cloke, U. S. N.; Passed Assistant Surgeon C. H. T, Lowndes, U. S. N., and Assistant Engineer W. C. Herbert, U. S. N.

SPECIAL OPERATIONS.

Occupation o f stations f o r observations o f currents in conncction with the speed friaZs o f the new Naval warvesscZ "Detroit."-In compliance with a request received from the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, Navy Department, instructions were issued March 30, 1893, by the Superintendent to the commanding officers of the steamers B a c k and BZake to report to Rear Admiral George E. Belknap, U. S. N., senior member of the board to conduqt the speed trial of the new naval war vessel Detroit, and to take such action as he should direct in connection with the trial trip of that cruiser. Lieut. G. W. Mentz, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the Blake, has submitted a report of the movements of his vessel after his arrival at New London and in pursuance of orders from Rear Admiral Belknap. He reached New London early in April, and during the first speed trials, which consisted of runs over the measured mile in Newport Harbor and turning trials, three officers were detailed to report to Rear Admiral Belknap on board of the Detroit as observers. The final trial involved a run over the 40-mile course in Long Island Sound, which had been laid out by the Coast and Geodetic Survey i n 1890; its limits having been defined by range signals upon the coasts of Long Island and Block Island. .During this run, Lieut. Mentz occupied three current stations along the course distant from each other g miles, using two of his boats for two of the stations and the Blake for the third. In taking the observations for direction and force of the currents, the Pillsbury meter and the -Ritchie-Haskell direction current meter were used. The observations of currents at the stations occupied by the steamer Bache were in immediate charge of Assistant E. E. Haskell, who had been instructed to report to the commanding officer of that vessel, Lieut. W. L. Burdick. Full reports of the results of the observations made from both vessels were forwarded to Rear Admiral Belknap immediately after the conclusion of the speed trials. The Blake then proceeded to New York under instructions to take part in the Naval 1 Review, April 27. Coit$letion o f the preliminary Zocafion o f the boundary line between the States o f PennsyZvania and Delaware, in accordance with the conditions imposed by the Joint Commission.-During the month of July, 1892,the reconnaissance for the triangulation required by the Joint Commission for the location of the boundary line between the States of Pennsylvania and Delaware was completed, and Assistant W. C.Hodgkins, who had been detailed for this duty early in May, began the building of signals. He was thus occupied during the months of August and September during a period which will long be remembered for heat prolonged in duration and of unusual intensity. Observing was advanced as rapidly as possible during October and November, but was greatly interferep with by the dense smoke which almost continually filled the air. It was frequently impossible to observe upon the nearest signals. Under such adverse conditions, rapid progress was not practicable, and in order to facilitate the work of delivering the boundary monuments upon the ground, a preliminary comPutation was made from tpe angles of the reconnaissance, and the staking out of the line

64

approximately was begun November 20. Although delayed by rainy weather, about half of the line had been thus run out from its western end to Brandywine Creek, when it became necessary to suspend operations in order to inspcct the work of setting the initial and terminal monuments in compliance with the wish of the Joint Commission. After the positions of the temporary stakes marking these points had been verified, the Commission decided to set the stones, though not without much opposition from some of the people living in the vicinity of the initial point, who alleged that the line as laid out would differ materially from the traditions of the locality in regard to its proper location. Upon the resumption of observations on the circular boundary, the weather became suddenly almost arctic in severity; much snow fell, and a succession of heavy gales piled it into deep drifts .which nearly closed the country roads to travel. T h e field work, however, was steadily prosecuted a t temperatures but little above zero, and the preliminary location of t h e line in accordance with the conditions imposed by the Joint Commission was completed on January 19,1893. As soon as the weather would permit, Mr. Hodgkins arranged with the surveyors of the Commission to go over the ground with them, point out the stakes and make such revision of the preliminary line as might be needed before i t was viewed by the Commission. He observes that all of the stones are believed to be very close to the true geodetic positions which they should occupy in order to conform to the curves adopted. In Appendix No. 8, Part 11, of this Annual Report will be found an Historical Account of the Boundary Line between the States of Pennsylvania and Delaware, prepared by Mr. Hodgkins, and followed by a detailed statement of the operations for its survey. Resumption o f obser vatioizs for the variation o f latitude at Rockville, Marjlland.-A full report of the observations for the variation of latitude made a t Rockville, Maryland, i n 1891-'92 and a discussion of the results has been published as Appendix No. I, 1892,Part 11. Early in December, 1892,in compliance with a request received from Prof. Simon Newcomb; U. S. N., in charge of the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, the Superintendent instructed Assistant Edwin Smith, the observer a t Rockville, to take up again the latitude work a t that station, and carry out as far as practical the scheme suggested by Prof. Newcomb. He desired the continuous prosecution of the observations, but ,suggested that if this should be found impracticable, the most important periods would be the months of December, 1892,and January, 1893,and June and July following, these being the periods of maximum and minimum, according to Prof. Chandler. For determining the epoch of variation, the most valuable observations would be those made midway between the times of maximum and minimum, namely in March and April, 1893, and again in October and November. A continuous prosecution of the work not being practicable without serious interference with Mr. Smith's duties as Chief of the Instrument Divisicn of the affice, he observed on all favorable nights during December, 1892 and June, 1893,and also from March 13 to the! middle of April, 1893, obtaining, during the months first named, 1 1 5 observations on twelve nights, and during t h e last named months only 43 observations on seven nights. During both periods exceedingly unfavorable weather prevailed; hence the small number of the observations, notwithstanding which, it is hoped that enough were obtained to define clearly the maximum and minimum. The stars observed were the same as those observed in the first series in 1891-'92,and t h e method was also the.same, except that only the middle thread of the the three micrometer threads was used for star bisections. T h e observations will be continued after the close of the fiscal year 1893,and upon their completion a detailed report will be submitted.

request of the legislature of the State, were well advanced toward completion during the fiscal year. The United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries aided greatly in the progress of the work by furnishing a steam launch and crew. Assistant James B. Baylor, to whom the execution of these surveys was assigned by the Superintendent in May, 1892,has from time to time made reports of their progress. The great nee2 of ascertaining by careful surveys, based upon shore trigonometrical stations, the exact limits of the natural oyster beds, rocks, and shoals, and of delineating these limits on charts, is shown by the fact, established by the statistical records of the United States Fish Commission that between the years 1880 and 1888 tbe value of the oyster product from Virgihia waters suffered a decline of $882 364. Under date,of May 31, 1893,Mr. Baylor reports that since the beginning of the fiscal year the following work had been accomplished: I n Tangier Sound, 36 miles of boundary lines around natural oyster beds were traced but and surveyed; the positions of I; triangulation stations were determined, and from these the positions of 60 corners of n a t u r d oyster beds were located; these beds embracing an area of 3 794 acres. I n Pocomoke Sound there were traced out and surveyed gg miles of boundary lines; the positions of 16 triangulation stations were determined, by means of which 150 corders of natural oyster beds were located, including an area of 28 528 acres. I n James River, 82 miles of boundary lines were traced out and surveyed; 18triangulation stations determined in position, and 114 corneTs of natural oyster beds were located, having an area of 25 IOO acres. I n Norfolk County, 43 miles of boundary lines were traced out and surveyed; 21 triangulation stations determined in position, a n d the corners of I I O natural oyster beds were located; these beds having an area of 7 340 acres, I n Mobjack Bay and in East and North rivers, 39 miles of boundary lines were traced out and surve9ed; the positions of 26 triangulation stations determined, and 88 corners of natural oyster beds, 4 500 acres in area, were located. All positions were plotted upon projection sheets by distances and angles. These sheets when completed were photolithographed and published. Five oyster chayts, including all the area surveyed up t o the date of the report, were issued and copies deposited in the ofice of the Survey a t the State Capitol, Richmond. A t the close of the fiscal year, Mr. Baylor had nearly completfd a survey of the natural oyster beds of the Rappahannock River, and expected to finish by the end of the season the field work for the whole of Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries embraced within the boundaries of the State ofAVirginia. Upon the completion of his surveys he will submit a - detailed report of his operations. Resurvey o f the boundary Cine befween the United States and Mexico froin the Rio Grande to the Paczpc.-Reference was made in the last annual report to the organization of a Commission on the part of the United States t o co-operate with a Commission on the part of the Mexican Government for the relocation of the nionumcnts marking the boundary line between the Unitetl States and Mexico, from the Rio Grande to the Pacific, and to the detail of Assistant A. T. Mosman to report for duty to the Department of State as Commissioner of the International Boundary Survey. T h e Superintendent has been informed from time t o time by Mr. Mosman of the progress of this important survey. His last report recites the advance made during the fiscal year 1893. Summarizing this report, i t may be stated that the chief operations executed during the year were the surveys, by the United States and wexican sections, of the line from Nogales, Arizona, along the parallel of 31O 20' to its junction with the onc hundred and eleventh meridian of west longitude; the definite settlement by the Joint Commission of the line of the parallel of 31O 47/,100 miles west of the Rio Grande, together with the meridian section of 31 miles connecting the parallel of 3 1 " 47' with that of 31" 2 0 ' ; the survey of the Colorado River for 2 0 miles below Yuma, and the beginning of surveys to the east and west of Yuma. 8.Ex. 19-5

For the work last named the United States section of the Commission was transferred to Yuma, and its headquarters established there in January, 1893,as it would have been impracticable, owing:to the extreme heat and scarcity of water, to make satisfactory progress in the summer. From one of the nionuments near the Colorado, for a distance of 104 miles along the line, there stretches a desert in which no water could be obtained except a t two places, one 45 and the other 63 milcs from the river. Beyond this to t h e eastward there was a stretch of 50 miles without water; this was successfully passed by the working parties by hauling water 30 miles and supplies from the nearest point on the railroad, a distance of 1 1 5 miles. During June the maximum temperature in the shade had been 118' F., and the mean maximum for the month 110' F. T h e parties working westward from Yuina found more water on their route, but were delayed by violent sand storms and high winds.
Resurvey o j thatpart o f the boundary Zinc between the States o f Caliyornia a d Nevada which extends f r o m apoirzt in Lake Tahoe to the Colorado Z<iv~~.--hresurvey and remarking of that part of the California-Nevada boundary line extending from a point in Lake Tahoe to the Colorado River having been provided for by Congress, instructions were issued April 17,1893, to Assistant George Davidson, placing in his hands thc general direction of the field operations, and assigning Assistants C. H. Sinclair and W. B. Fairfield to duty in his party. This boundary is defined by Act of Congress as a straight line joining two points, and beginning a t the intersection of the thirty-ninth parallel of north latitude and the one hundred and twentieth degree of longitude west from Greenwich, and proceeding in a southeasterly direction in a straight line to the point where the thirty-fifth parallcl of north latitude crosses the Colorado River. It was deemed advisable, on account of the differcnt climatic conditions obtaining at the two ends of the line, that the work should begin a t the southeastern terminus. A study of the Ives Exploration Maps of 1858and 1863, taken in connection with the phraseology of the Act of Congress of 1860, led the Superintendent to infer that the conditions to which this terminus was subjected would be satisfied by assuming it to be midway bctwcen the two bluffs between which the Colorado River flows, on the line of the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude. Mr. Davidson was accordingly advised that two stations in latitude 3 5 ' N. on these bluffs, equidistant from the point agreed upon as the terminus, should be carefully determined and well marked. A t the northwestern terminus, on Lake Tahoe, the work was to consist of the vcrification of the location of the Initial Boundary Monument, an astronomical station being established near it, the latitude observed and the longitude determined by thc most convenient and available method. Mr. Davidson has made a report of the progress of this extremely difficult piece of geodetic work up to the early part of September, 1893. T h e parties of Assistants Sinclair and Fairfield were started into the field on June 13, and began work a t the Needles, California, near the southeastern terminus. Mr. Sjnclair made observations for latitude near thc old boundary monument a t 3 5 ' , and observed for azimuth. Mr. Fairficld executed a triangulation from the Needles to the thirty-fifth parallcl, measuring a basc near the former and coming to the boundary in threc quadritaterals. He observed also for azimuth. I Mr. Sinclairexecuted a small sheet of topography to cover both sides of the river bottom, carrying his survey about z miles above and z bclow the thirty-fifth parallel. The hard banks, between which the river i6 ever changing its course: wcrc shown by this survey to be 2 miles apart. T h e party suffered greatly here from the intense heat (1134 F.), and Mr. Sinclair was for a time prostrated by it. H e commends the assistance which he received from Mr. G. J. Kammerer, recorder.

As soon as the southeast work had been dona, the parties took the field in the mountain ranges about Lake Tahoe, a t the northwest limit of the diagonal boundary. T h e intersection of the thirty-ninth parallel and theeone hundred and twentieth meridian is the starting point to the southeast for this diagonal, and this'point is 3 5 milks in the lake. For the determination of the longitude of a station near the boundary line on the southeast shore of Lake Tahoe, Mr. Sinclair exchanged telegraphic signals with Mr. Davidson, who occupied a station a t Carson City, Nevada, in close proximity to t h e private observatory of Chas. W. Friend, Esq., the longitude of which had been determined i n 1889. T h e use of a telephone line between Carson City and Bijou to be connected with the main line of the Western Union Company a t Carson City, was obtained through the courtesy of Messrs. Bliss, Terrington, Folsom, Averill, and Ramsay. The Western Union Company also rendered every facility for the work. At the boundary station near the lake, M;. F. W. Edmonds of the Sub-office, San Francisco, acted as telegraph operator for Mr. Sinclair. Longitude signals having been exchanged on three good nights in the first position of the observers, Mr. Davidson went to the Lake station, and Mr. Sinclair to Carson City, and exchanges of signals were obtained on three nights more, completing the longitude determination. Mr. Siiiclair then observed for latitude a t Carson to check former observations, and afterwards a t the Lake station. An azimuth station was selected by Mr. Davidson near the station of 1890; established by Messrs. Grunsky and Minto under act of the legislature of California. Mr. Davidson's station was only about 45 yards from the shore of the lake, the ground about .it being heavy, coarse, dry sand, and backed by marsh about 75 yards inside. Special care was taken to get a firm foundation of rock and cement for the theodolite pier, and as a t night the weather was generally quite calm, no changes of level were detected except when persons in the observatory changed places. T h e azimuth mark was at Tallac, distant 5.87 mile across the lake and about 15 feet above the water. For azimuth, 185 observations were made upon B A C; 4165 near western elongation and on Alpha U r s z Minoris near eastern elongation, each star being observed ' every night for nine nights. Two hundred and twenty-five observations were made upon the mark. Time for the azimuth observations was noted by Mr. F. W. Edmonds, and Mr. Sinclair made the transit observations a t the boundary monument of 1873 on the road. Mr. Davidson carried the chronometer between the two stations. During the morning when the signals were visible from the eastern side of the lake, the TalIac azimuth mark was connected trigonometrically with Tallac Azimuth station, Rubicon Point station, Observatory Point station, Folsom's Knob, Sinclair Flag, and with the Boundary Monument of 1873. T h e triangulation was developed by Mr. Fairfield from the old line of the main triangulation Mount Lola-Round Top, which overlooks the mountains east of Lake Tahoe, but does not see the lake At the time Mr. Davidson left for San Francisco, the high Sierra stations had been occupiel and those overlooking the lake were being occupied. Mr. G. J. Kammerer served as recorder for Mr. Fairfield. Mr. Sinclair carried forward the topography of the shores of the lake to control all of. the stations of the former boundary work, and to'exhibit the features of the surface over that Part of the boundary which lies between the lake shores and the sharply rising mountains 3 miles to the southeast. H e has found some of the former monument marks, and will include them in the topography and triangulation, and thus determine their errors in position. T h e subsequent progress of this important survey will be adverted t o i n the next annual report.

Columbia, the Superintendent, having been appointed by the President as United States Commissioner, conferred with the Hon. W. F. King, Canadian Coxnmissioner, and formulated. plans of operations to be begun in southeastern Alaska as carly in the spring of 1 8 g j as would be practicable. I n March of that year instructions ,were given by the Supcrintendent to the following named o6cers of the Survey who were thereby assigned to the charge of tlic Alaska boundary parties, and were directed to proceed to Post Townsend, Washington, from which port they would be conveyed to their several destinations by the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamers Patterson and Hassler: Assistants H. G. Ogden, 0. H. Tittniann, E. F. Dickins, J. E. McGrath, and Expert Observer H. P. Ritter. Their work involved the establishment of astronomical stations a t or near the mouths of the Unuk, Stikine, and Taku rivers; the deterniination of latitude and the magnetic elements a t each of these stations, and of their longitude by exchanges of chronometer comparisons with the observatory a t Sitka; reconnaissances, accompanied by members of the Canadian parties, from t h e mouth of each river t o points not less than 3 0 nautical miles from the shore of the mainland, in a direction at right angles to its general trend, with a view of determining the most advantageous route for a trigonometrical survey, or whether such a survey would be practicable; and upon the completion of the reconnaissances and a topographical sketch of the route, a junction with thc Canadian parties, accompanying them on such surveys as they might have been instructed to take up, making such a reconnaissance based on angular measurements and magnetic bearings and checked by astronomical observations, as would serve to form a just estimate of the value of their work. T h e officer assigned t o duty on Holkham Bay was directed to accompany a Canadian party in the survey of that bay, and to make such a topographical reconnaissance, with angular measurements and magnetic bearings, checked where practicable by astronomical

observations, as would enable him to estimate the value of their surveys and their location of mountain peaks and ranges, if the latter should be found to exist. T h e attention of each chief of party was invited to that part of the treaty of 1867,between the United States and Russia, which relates to the Alaska-British Columbia Boundary line, arid which is as follows: Commencing from the southernmost point of the island called Prince of Wales Island, which point lies in the parallel of 54 degrees 40 minutes north latitude, and between the 131st and the 133d degree of west longitude (meridian of Greenwich), the said,line shall ascend to the north along the channel called Portland Channel as f a r as the point of the continent where it strikes the 56th degree of north latitude; from this last-mentioned point the line of demarcation shall follow the summit of the mountains situated parallel to the coast as far as the point of intersection of the 141st degree of west longitude (of the same meridian) and finally, from the said point of intersection, the said meridian line of the 141st degree, in its prolongation as far as the Frozen Ocean. IV. With reference to the line of demarcatioll laid down in the preceding article, it is understood1st. Th'at the island called Prince of Wales Island shall belong wholly to Russia (now by this cession to the United States). 2d. T h a t whenever the summit of the mountains which extend in a direction parallel t o the coast from the 56th degree of north latitude to the point of intersection of the 141st degree of west longitude shall prove to be a t the distance of more than ten marine leagues from the ocean, the limit between the British possessions and t h e line of coast which is to belong to Russia as above mentioned (that is to say, the limit to the possessions ceded by thls convention) shall be formed by a line parallel to t h e winding of the coast, and which shall never exceed the distance of ten marine leagues therefrom. I n view of these provisions of the treaty, each chief of the party was instructed to collect all possible geographical information, particularly as to the location of mountain peaks, and the existence of a range of mountains parallel to the coast, and in the event of finding that such a range existed, it was regarded as of the first importance that its distance from the coast and its general trend should be determined, unless such distance should considerably exceed the specified 30 nautical miles. T h e abstracts from the reports of the chiefs of parties which follow, summarize the progress made up to the end of the fiscal year, June 30, 1893. Detailed notices of the work of the season, which closed in September of that year, are necessarily reserved for t h e next annual report. Surveys oft the U w k River.-By instructions issued in March, 1893, Assistant E. F. Dickins was charged with the execution of a reconnaissance of the Unuk River, Alaska, in connection with a Canadian party making a preliminary survey for the location of the boundary line between Alaska and the British possessions. His first work was to be the establishment of an astronomical station at `or near the mouth of t h e river, and then to leave the station in charge of a n astronomer, assigned to duty i n his party, the astronomer to determine latitude and longitude of his station, observe as often as possible for time, so as to rate accurately his chronometers, and upon the arrival' of the steamer carrying chronometers from Sitka, to make careful comparisons of his chronometers with those of the steamer. Observations for the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were also to be made a t a convenient opportunity. This station having been left in charge of the astronomer, Mr. Dickins was directed to make a reconnaissance from the mouth of the river to a point not less than 30 nautical miles from t h e shore of the mainland, i n a direction at right angles to its general trend, with a view of determining the most advantageous route for a trigonometrical survey, or whether such a survey is practicable. Upon this reconnaissance Mr. Dickins was to take one man and by agreement with the Canadian Commissioner, he was to be accompanied by the Canadian party, who would afford him such facilities as were in their power. H e was

'

instructed also t o give the Chief of the Canadian party every facility for informing himself of the nature and progress of his work. Later, the conditions were to be reversed, and Mr. Dickins was instructed to accompany the Canadians on such survey as they might see fit to take up, his duties being as stated under the preceding general heading. T h e report which h e has submitted states the progress of the work entrusted to him from t h e date of his receiving his instructions, March 9, up to the close of the fiscal year. Before leaving San Francisco, he was directed to attend as far as possible to the purchase of the necessary outfit and provisions and the selection of hands for all of .the Alaska boundary parties, so that there might be no delay in the departure of the steamers Patterson and Uassler, intended to convey these parties to Alaska. On April 3, Mr. H. W. Edmonds reported for duty as astronomer, and on the 13th, left on the steamer Patterson for Port Townsend. Mr. Dickins joined the Patterson a t that port on the rgth, and on the 21st left in her for Victoria, British Columbia, arriving there the same evening. Next day the Hon. W. F. King, Canadian Boundary Commissioner, and his chief assistant, Dr. 0.J. Klotz, came aboard and held an informal conference with Lieut. Commander Ackley and the chiefs of the Alaska boundary parties, Assistants Ogden, Tittmann, Dickins, and McGrath. After coaling a t Departure Bay and stopping a t Port Simpson t o refit the steam launch Cosmos, the Patterson, with the Cost~zos in tow, came to anchor on May 3 a t the head of Burroughs Bay, and on the day after, landed Mr. Dickins's instruments, camp outfit, lumber for observatory, etc. On the Sth, the Patterson left for Fort Wrangell, and that afternoon t h e Canadian steamer Quadra arrived and landed two parties, one under Mr. Saint Cyr, t o make a reconnaissance of the Unuk River, and the other under Dr. Klotz, to make a reconnaissance across the country from Burroughs Bay to Bradfield Inlet. T h e Canadians, with a party consisting of the chief, his assistant and four men, and having a camp outfit and three Peterborough canoes, began operations by measuring a chain base of 4 300 feet on the marsh at the mouth of the Unuk River. T h e party of Mr. Dickins meanwhile completed the observatory, built a brick pier, set up the meridian transit, and made everything ready for the astronomical work. He connected the observatory by a small triangulation with the Canadian base a t the mouth of the Unuk, and also with two stations, T a b and Oak, of the old hydrographic survey. On May 16, having been informed by Mr. Saint Cyr, Chief of the Canadian party-that he was ready to begin the river work, Mr. Ijickins joined him, Mr. Edmonds remaining in charge of the zstronomical work at Burroughs Bay. Proceeding u p the Unuk River, a timber jam was encountered about 2 miles from the mouth, and the party had to go into camp for the night. About midnight the camp was partly submerged by a sudden freshet, b u t the next morning it began to subside, and reaching higher ground a mile further up, camp was pitched again. On May 20, therunning of a traverse line u p the river was begun. T h e stations averaged I 500 feet apart, and the distances were determined by micrometer readings on a rod with fixed targets, the angles and compass bearings of the courses being taken with a 4-inch theodolite. Horizontal and vertical angles were measured also on all the mountain peaks and prominent objects, and the topography was sketched as the party moved forward. Mr. Dickins observes that the valley of the river has an average width. of about a mile, and is flanked by very rough and rugged mountains from 3,000 to 6,000 feet in height and cut in all directions by deep gorges. T h e timber line extends from 2,000 to 2,500 feet above the valley, and t h e mountain tops were covered with snow. T h e river is divided into a number of small channels, with islands covered with a growth of alder, cottonwood, and willow trees, and having numerous sand and gravel bars between them. On the main banks of the river and the mountain sides, the timber is principally spruce a n d fir, with a dense growth of underbrush, through which it is almost impossible

to make any headway without cutting. T h e current was so strong that i t was found impracticable to paddle the loaded canoes against it, and the men had to tow them by long lines from the gravel bars, crossing over from time to time t o that bank which offered the best facilities for tracking. T h e water was ice cold and both officers and men had to wade knee-deep in it almost every day, hauling the canoes over the shoals and rapids, and making but slow progress. The weather also was very unfavorable; there was rain every other day and the ground was like a wet sponge. From May 3, the date of arrival in Burroughs Bay, until June 30, there were thirty-five rainy days. On June 14, the parties entered the Waterfall Canyon, 17 miles above the observatory. This canyon is about 1% miles long and averages 150 feet in width. On the east side the ridges and cliffs are almost perpendicular for several hundred feet; on the west side there is a vertical cliff of lava between 2 0 and 40 feet in height, with a few feet of soil on top and densely covered with timber and underbrush. Through fissures in this lava cliff the water pours in numerous small streams and waterfalls into the canyon below. The current through the canyon is very strong and full of whirlpools, and it was found to be a very tedious and dangerous undertaking to haul the loaded canoes through it. Fortunately this was accomplished without accident. On June 30, the work was still in progress and the parties had reached a point 24 miles above the observatory. Mr. Dickins acknowledges the very efficient service rendered by Mr. Edmonds, the astronomer in his party.
Surveys on the Sfikz'mRiver.-The field operations on the Stikine River, in connection with the Alaska-British Columbia boundary survey, were placed in charge of Assistant 0. H. Tittmann. Assistant J. F. Pratt, Subassistants J. A. Flenier and G. R. Putnani, and Aid A. L. Baldwin were directed to report to him for duty in his party. T h e purchase of the camp outfit required by this and other parties had been committed , t o the charge of Assistant E. F. Dickins, in San Fran'cisco; about one-half of the number of hands needed were engaged there also by Mr. Dickins, the relnainder being selected in Seattle by Assistant Pratt. Proceeding from San Francisco to Seattle and Port Townsend, Mr. Tittmann left the last named port April 21, on board of the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Hassler, and arrived a t Fort Wrangell, Alaska, on the evening of May 2 . On the following morning the building of a temporary observatory was begun by Mr. Putnam, while Mr. Pratt supervised the construction of a storehouse, adjoining and forming part of the observatory. A search for old triangulation points and the building of signals were begun on May 5, and continued until the party left the NassCer and went into camp near the mouth of the Stikine River on May 9. At this date the party was joined by Mr. H. H. Robertson, Dominion Land Surveyor, representing t h e Canadian Commissioner, and Mr. Pratt was assigned to duty with Mr. J. Gibbons, Dominion Land Surveyor, whose party was to operate on the north side of the Stikine River, while Mr. Plemer joined the Canadian party under Mr. C. A. Talbot, Dominion Land Surveyor, whose work was on the south side of the river. T o Mr. Putiiam was assigned the immediate charge of the astronomical station at Fort Wrangell, involving the determination of the latitude of that station, and of its longitude by exchanges of chronometric comparisons with the astronomical station a t Sitka. By the end of the fiscal year h e had completed the observations for latitude, and had obtained chronometer comparisons for longitude with Sitka during four trips of the steamer ifassler. He had determined also the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity. Mr. Baldwin joined Mr. Titt\mann's immediate party. At the first camp, the triangulation which was to extend from the astronomical station U P the Stikine was b e e n . On May 17, a b a s e line z 3 2 0 metres (1'44 miles) was measured

72

with a 50-metre steel tape on Farm Island by Mr. Tittmann, with the co-operation of the two Canadian parties camped near by. On May 23 camp was struck and put on board the steamer Alaskan, bound u p the river. A point a t the 1.ower mouth of the Porcupine River was ultimately selected for beginning the work, and traverse triangulation was carried thence down the river, reaching the Great Glacier by the end of t h e fiscal year. I n the meantime Messrs. Pratt and Flemer accompanied the Canadian parties, and made many dangerous ascents of mountain peaks over ice and snow. Details of their progress, and that of the other parties, subsequent to June 30, 1893, will be given i n the next annual report.
Surveys on Holkham Bay.-Mr. Homer P. Ritter, expert observer, who was assigned to duty i n Alaska as topographer to accompany a Canadian party to be engaged in the survey of Holkham Bay, has submitted a report giving a summary of progress made from his arrival in Holkham Bay, May IO, to the end of the fiscal year. Having joined the Canadian party May 11, work was begun by the occupation of stations at each end of the Holkham base; angles being measured and photographs taken by the Canadians, and angles and sketches by Mr. Ritter. Camp was then moved to Sandford Cove, on Endicott Arm, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey station, Clot, was similarly occupied. A mountain peak (Peak station, No. I), about 7 miles in a northeasterly direction from this station, was also occupied, and sketches made from a n auxiliary sketch station a t the camp. After the occupation of Peak station, No. 2, 5 miles southeast of Sandford Cove, camp was moved 1 2 miles higher up Endicott Arm, and five ascents were made of Peak station, No. 3, but without results, owing to the prevalence of rain and fog. During the whole month of June there were but three days on which observations could be made. Progress after June 30, 1893, will be stated in the next annual report.

Surveys on TaRu In&-The report of Assistant J. E. McGrath, assigned to the charge of a party for t h e survey of Taku Inlet in connection with the operations for the preliminary location of the Aldska-British Columbia Boundary line, refers a t the outset to his arrival in San Francisco early in April, 1893,and to his finding that all of the party supplies had been carefully secured and packed ready for shipment, and that a force of competent men had been selected for service in Alaska, Assistant E. F. Dickins having been chiefly instrumental in advancing these matters so that no delays should occur in party organization. Mr. McGrath reached Seattle April 16. Here Assistant J. F. Pratt had assenibled another force of capable men, and Mr. McGrath expressed his gratification with the selections made for his own party, all of those selected proving to be thoroughly suitable for the work. On the evening of April 2 1 , the Coast and Geodetic Survey vessels left Port Townsend on their way north ; the usual stops being made a t Departure Bay for coal and a t Port Simpson for the steam launch Cosmos, which had been laid up there for the winter. On the morning of May 6 the Patterson arrived a t Port Wrangell, and anchored, to await the coming of the British steamer Quadra, having on board the members of the Canadian surveying parties. Upon the arrival of the Quadt-a next day, a conference was held on board of her, in which the movements of the several vessels were settled, and Hon. W. F. King, the Canadian Boundary Commissioner, announced the proposed distribution of his parties, and the date on which h e expected to bring his field work to a close for the season. After leaving Wrangell the Patterson, with the Canadian steamer, proceeded to Holkham Bay, where they parted, the Patterson continuing on her course to Taku Inlet, and anchoring near its head on the evening of May 11. Arrangements were a t once made for a base of supplies common to t h e two parties of Messrs. Ogden and McGrath at the mouth of the Taku River. T h e combined parties rapidly

erected a storehouse a t this locality, and worked together in selecting and measuring a base, and in securing material for beginning triangulation. Mr. McGrath remarks that the ground was covered by deep snow in every direction; the head of the inlet was nearly full of great masses of floating ice, which were constantly separating from the face of the Foster glacier, and in getting the camp equipage, instruments, and supplies from the Patterson to the shore, on May IZ the boat work took on a very characteristic Arctic semblance as the various boats were tortuously guided through the narrow and shifting lanes of open water between the icebergs and floes. T h e work of pitching camp and erecting a storehouse having been completed, and a' site selected for a base, the line was measured by Mr. McGrath with a steel tape. T h e base was measured in two sections, and the reduced length was I 541.54 metres. A reconnaissance for the triangulation down the inlet was then begun, special efforts being made, though with but moderate success, to recover as many of the stations marked by hydrographic parties as possible. T h e shore of the inlet consists of an extremely hard rock, upon which the tempered chisels taken up by the party either broke or became useless after a short time. After obtaining chisels specially hardened for this work in the Treadwell Mine shops, it became possible to mark the station points on'the rock in a way that would make it comparatively easy t o recognize them in the future. T h e triangulation of thc inlet, and the determination of positions and of the heights of the mountains visible from it, occupied the party through the remainder of May, and during the month of June. Upon its completion a t the end of June everything was made ready fqr transfer to the Stikine River upon the arrival of the Hassler. Subassistant F. A . Young served most acceptably in Mr. McGrathS party. Progress after July I, 1893, will be stated in the next annual report. Up to that date twenty-six stations had been occupied for horizontal and five for vertical measures ; fiftyeight stations determined in geographical position, and thirty elevations trigonometrically; one magnetic station occupied, and an area of 14.4 square miles of topography surveyed. Surveys on the Taku River.-Assistant Herbert G. Ogden has submitted a preliminary report of the operations of his party engaged upon the survey of the Taku River, Alaska, in connection with the Alaska-British Columbia Boundary work. T h e party having been organized in San Francisco and Seattle by Assistants Dickins and Pratt, Mr. Ogden joined it a t Port Townsend on board the steamer faiterson, the latter part of April, and proceeding northward, reached Holkham Ray on May IO. On the following day he transferred Assistant W. C. Hodgkins with one man to the Canadian party in charge of Mr. Ogilvie, representing the Canadian Government Survey, who was to operate north of Taku Inlet, while Assistant P. A. Welker, with one man, was directed to join a party under Mr. MacArthur, of the Canadian Survey, whose work was north of Holkham Bay and toward Taku Inlet. He then received on board the Patterson Mr. A. Driscoll, with one man, who was to represent the Canadians in his own immediate party. Sailing from Holkham Bay on the same day, he arrived in the evening a t t h e head of Taku Inlet; on the next day landed stores and baggage, and on the morning of May 13 he moved ashore with his whole party. Assistant McGrath, who had been associated with him in the survey of Taku Inlet and 'River, landed his party a t the same time, the arrangement being that Mr. Ogden should ascend the river while Mr. McGrath undertook the survey of the inlet. An astronomical station was a t once established, a temporary observatory having been completed in time for observations on the evening of May 14. Mr. 0. B. French was placed in charge as observer. A good location for a base line was found a t the mouth of the river, and the line was measured by Mr. McGrath, while both parties operated in the vicinify in the erection of signals and in reconnaissance for a triangulation that would facilitate the extension of the work in both directions. Before the end of the month Mr. Ogden moved his party to the first camp above the mouth of the river.

From this time on the progress up the river was steady, and a t the close of June, the party was in camp a short distance above a point on the river where a line T O marine leagues from the coast would cross the stream. The triangulation extended for 23 miles up the river, and was checked by two short base lines and one azimuth on the sun a t the upper end of the work. The river bottom was found to have an average width of about 3 miles, and the mountains, which rise abruptly on either side, ranged in height from 4 ooo to G ooo feet. A topographical sketch of the river, based upon the triangulation, was made. It included a representation of the mountain peaks visible from the river bottom, with a general delineation of the mountain forms. It developed also several valleys and canyons that seemed to be of considerable extent, and the courses of two large glaciers for a d;stance of several miles until they disappeared behind the mountain tops. During the month of June, although much unfavorable weather prevailed, three exchanges of chronometer comparisons were obtained by the trips of the steamer Hassler to and from the observatory a t Sitka. During this month Mr. Hodgkins, in connection with Mr. Ogilvie, made several ascents of the mountains north of Taku, and Mr. Welker with Mr. MacArthur practically completed the observations that were necessary on the north shore of Tracy Arm. Two permanent marks were left in convenient and secure localities from which to determine the exact position of the boundary line, or of a point I O marine leagues distant from the coast, so that these marks will be available when the time shall come for the erection of permanent boundary monuments. Mr. Ogden acknowledges his indebtedness to Mr. Driscoll for assistance rendered on many occasions. Mr. S R. Tinsley, assigned to duty as temporary aid, soon acquired proficiency in observing. On July 9, all the work on the Taku Kiver having been completed, the party returned to the astronomical station to await the arrival of the steamer Hassler for transportation to t h e Stikine River. Command o f the $eet o f vessels selected f o r service in the watevs o f Alaska, hi cotinection with fh; operations o f the parties assigned to the Alaska-British Colurnbip Bouiidavy Survey.-Early in April, 1893, instructions were issued to Lieut. Commander S. M. Ackley, U. S. N.. Hydrographic Inspector, Coast and Geodetic Survey, directing him to proceed to Port Townsend, Washington, and upon the arrival of the steamers Patterson and Uassler from San Francisco, to take command of the fleet of vessels selected for service in Alaskan waters, and arrange for the transportation of the civilian parties, with their equipment and supplies, by a suitable division between t h e two steamers. These preparations completed, he was then to proceed to Victoria, British Columbia, and confer with Hon. W. F. King, the British Commissioner, rendering such assistance to Mr. King in the,distribution of his parties as might seem desirable or necessary. He was also to consult with the chiefs of the Alaskan Boundary parties, Assistants Ogden, Tittmann, Dickins, and McGrath, in regard to the best times of leaving their parties a t their aespective destinations, and upon landing them, he was instructed t o render all possible assistance by details of ship's carpenters, and other men, to aid in t h e erection of t h e temporary observatories. Lieut. Commander Ackley's instructions gave him full infofmation relating to the service expected from the commanding officers of the Patterson and the IXassLer during the season, . and a t its close he was dirkcted to collect the civilian parties and bring them back to Port Townsend. T h e report h e h a s submitted states that a t the conference held with the British Cornmissioner i n Victoria, British Columbia, in April, it was agreed that the field work of the several parties should be continued till about September I. After landing the parties a t their destinations, the Patterson took up the survey of Sitka Harbor, and a t tht. close of the fiscal year good progress had 'been made. As soon as the astronomical observatory a t Sitka had been erected, and time observations obtained, the

Uassler began a series of trips between Sitka and the several astTonomica1 stations established

by the civilian parties engaged in the surveys on the Unuk and Stikine rivers, on Taku Inlet, and in Taku River. Lieut. Commander Ackley st3tes that the weather during the entire season was very favorable for navigation, there being' no gales of wind and but little fog. There were, however, some long intervals of thick and cloudy weather at Sitka when it was impossible to get astronomical observations ; none could be made from this cause from May 23 to June 5, and a number of times after that the Hassler was compelled to lie a t Sitka eight and ten days a t a time. Reference to that part of his report which recites the movements of the vessels and parties after July I, 1893, will be made in the next annual report of the Superintendent. TidaZ obsemations a t Honolub, Hawaiian IslmJs.-Through the courtesy of the Hawaiian Government Survey, the Coast and Geodetic Survey has been furnished with tracings from the automatic tide-gauge record a t Honolulu, Oahu, from June 16, 1891, to June 30, 1893. T h e observer is Mr. C. J. Lyons.

ABSTRACT OF T H E A N N U A L REPORT OF T H E ASSISTANT I N CHARGE OF T H E OFFICE.

I n Office Report No. I will be found the annual rcport of Mr. B. A. Colonna, who has continued on duty as Assistant in charge of the Office during the fiscal year. Since November, 1892, he has had the aid of Assistant Spencer C. McCorkle, who has attended to various details of executive duty, and has acted in Mr. Colonna's place during his absence. Important iniprovements were made during the year in the three buildings, Nos. 201, 203, and 205 New Jersey avenue SE., occupied by the Office of the Survey, and now owned by the United States. T h e old plumbing in Nos. 201 and 205, having been condemned, was removed and replaced by new sanitary plumbing, and in No. 203, a fire-proof structure, the heating apparatus was entirely removed to make room for the storage of engraved plates and other valuable property. I n No. 205 a new boiler and steam radiators, together with portable apparatus for extinguishing fire were introduced, and this building is now regarded as in good working order, and as safe from injury by fire as the most improved hose, chemical extinguishers, etc., can make it. During the absence of the Superintendent at various periods, Mr. Colonna acted in his place. Under instructions from the Secretary of the Treasury he proceeded to Chicago on June 14, and remained there until June 30, in charge of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Exhibit a t the World's Colunibian Exposition. He observes that the work of the several Divisions of the Office, and. of the Boards organized by direction of the Superintendent for the consideration of charts, of the library and archives, and of instruments and their construction, has made satisfactory progress. For details of the operations of the Computing, Tidal, Drawing, Engraving, Chart, Miscellaneous, Instrument, and Library and Archives Divisions, he refers to the reports of their respective chiefs, which accompany his own annual report. By the deaths of Mr. C. H. W. Junken, civil expert, and Mr. E. Willenbucher, hydrographic draughtsman, the survey has sustained serious loss, their skill derived from natural ability and long experience making their services of special value. The death of Assistant J. Henry Turner, assistant Chief of the Engraying Division was fitly noticed in a memorial tribute issued by the Superintendent. Assistant Charles A. Schott has continued to serve as Chief of the Computing Division, and submits with his annual report a statement of the changes in the force of computers during the fiscal year. H e has directed and supervised the labors of the computers, reported the results of the computations, and furnished to the office such data and information as were required for the field parties, and in response to requests, official or personal, from persons not connected with the survey. Reports were submitted on the final results for the variation of the latitude of Rockville, and papers on the initial datum level of the topographic survey of. the District of Columbia; on the proposed international projects of maps, and on the best method of laying down the boundary line between California and Nevada. The discussion of the results of the differential measurcs of the vertical force component of the magnetic intensity at LOS Angeles, California, and of the variations of dip and total force was completed in a paper for

78

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

the annual report of the Superintendent. At the request of the Commissoner of the General Land Office, a second and enlarged edition of the treatise on the distribution of terrestrial niagnetism'in the United States, with tables to facilitate magnetic observations was prepared for a new edition of the Land Official Manual; this paper was accompanied by two isogonic charts for 1890, corrected to date. Data were furnished for the three gl6bes for the World's Columbian Exposition, illustrating the distribution of terrestrial magnetism, the gravity stations, the lines of precise leveling, and the geodetic arcs, both ancient and modern, for the size and figure of the earth. Mr. Schott continued to perform the duties of examiner of computers for the Civil Service Commission. The annual report of the Tidal Division is submitted by Assistant George A. Fairfield, the charge of it having been assigned to him on May 9, 1893. From the beginning of the fiscal year till April 18,Mr. A. S. Christie continued to serve as its chief; later he was transferred to the Computing Division. T h e tide tables for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts for 1894 were prepared for publication, and both volumes were published before June 30,1893. The predictions for both volumes for the years 1895 and 1896 were also substantially completed, having been pressed forward with all possible despatch in order that the Tide Predicting Nachine might be spared for the World's Columbian Exposition. During the year a new set of stencils, devised to reduce the labor of reduction by the method of harmonic analysis, was prepared in accordance with the plans of Mr. L. P. Shidy, tidal computer, for many years a member of the Tidal Division. These stencils can be used for the analysis of any series of tidal observations of sufficient length, and on different series can be used until they gradually wear out when they can be readily replaced from the computed tables. T h e general assignment of work in the Drawing Division, as reported by its chief, Assistant W. H. Dennis, has been similar to,that of previous years. I n the tabular statement of information furnished in rcsponse to special calls, which accompanies his annual report, there is included a list of drawings of twenty-nine maps mgde a t the request of the Department of State for use in the Bering Sea seal fishery arbitration. . During the year, drawings were made f O T thirty-one new charts, forty-three new editions of charts, and for fifty-four sketches and illustrations for the annual report. of the Superintendent. Photographs of original sheets of forty-four section maps of the Dl'strict of Columbia were made ready for engraving. T h e usual demands upon the Division for projections for field use, and corrections and additions to the published chart`s were promptly met. Assistant Dennis submits also the annual report of the Engraving Division, which has been under his direction since March 26, 1893, soon after the assignment of Assistant 13. G. Ogden to special duty on the Alaska-British Columbia Boundary survey. Assistant John Henry Turner, who had been directed to report for duty as acting chief under Mr. Dennis, served with great &-edit until early in June, when he was taken with an illness which terminated fatally on the 12th of that month. T h e most important engraved plates finished during the year were those of Chart A, Cape Sable to Cape Hatteras (scale I-zpo 000)and Charts Nos. 5 400 and 6 100 (scale I-ZOO OOO), including the Pacific Coast from Point Buchon to Point Pinos, and extending northward from Cape Lookout to Gray's Harbor. A large number of important plates were materially advanced, among them those of Sailing Charts B and C of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from Cape Hatteras to the Rio Grgnde. Mr. D. C . Chapman has continued in charge of the electrotyping and photographing rooms. A list by title and number of the engraved plates completed, continued, or commenced during the year accompanies the report of Mr. Dcnnis, and will be filed in the Archives.

T h e annual report of the Chart Division is submitted by Assistant Gershom Bradford, who has continued in charge of it as heretofore. A comparative table of issue`s of charts for the years 1889 to 1893 inclusive, which gives the number of copies and their cost, accompanies his report, and from it Mr. Bradford derives a total issue for 1893, three per cent larger than that of the preceding fiscal year, and one per cent larger than the average of the four previous years. Rut as the net sales have decreased, the free distributiot, of charts shows a corresponding increase. Part of this increase was doubtless due to the distribution of charts to -120 libraries, selected after consultation with United States Senators and apportioned among the States according to population, but not less than two to any State. T h e wish of the librarians to have the charts, their ability to care for them and make them accessible to the public, having been ascertained, sets of 160 charts were supplied, including the most important, and eventually complete sets will be furnished. A new edition of the Catalogue of Charts has been sent to press and will soon be published. Mr. M. W. Wihes, Chief of the Miscellaneous Division, reports that 26980 copies of charts were sent to sales agents during the year, and that the total number of agencies for the sale of charts, coast pilots, and other publications O f the Survey was ninety-three, seventytwo on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and twenty-one on the Pacific Coast. The increase in the number of these agencies during the past ten years is one of the most significant indications of the increasing demand for the publications of the Survey which have an intimate connection with the interests of commerce and navigation. I n 1883 there were forty-six sale agencies, forty on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and six on the Pacific Coast. Among the publications received from the Public Printer during the year were the fol1owing: United States Coast Pilot, Atdantic Coast, Part IV, from Point Judith to New York; Pacific Coast Pilot, Alaska, Part I, nixon Entrance to Yakutat Ray, with Inland. Passage from Strait of Fuca to Dixon Entrance, and a set of fourteen pamphlets descriptive of the various branches of the work of the Survey which were illustrated a t the World's Columbinn Exposition. These monographs were for free distribution to all persons who desired information respecting the exhibit of the Survey a t Chicago. T h e report of Assistant Edwin Smith, Chief of the Instrument Division, shows that notwithstanding the unusual demands made upon this Division during the year in the preparation of t h e instrumental exhibit for the World's Columbian Exposition, the current work was kept up to date, and some very creditable specimens of fine instrumental work were finished. Among these were two 12-inch direction theodolites (Nos. 145 and 146), in which certain radical changes were found to be necessary. An examination and test of the performance of these instruments by Assistant Woodward in the spring of 1893 showed that they were of the first order. For the perfection of their design and their fine graduation, Mr. Smith gives credit to Mr. E. G. Fischer, chief instrument maker, and for the fine workmanship upon them to instrument maker Otto Storm. Four new magnetometers, original in design in some respects, were completed, and the construction of two Duplex Base Bars from plans and specifications presented by Assistant Eimbeck was finished. A plane-table alidade was designed and constructed during the year, mainly according to specifications furnished by the Topographical Conference of 1892. Much experimental work was accomplished tending to improve the working of the three pendulums of the Half-second Pendulum Apparatus A; -three new half-second pendulums were made with planes instead of knife-edges, and an experimental quarter-second pendufum and support was constructed. Mr. Smith observes that with the facilities of the Instrument Shop, increased as they have been during the year by the purchase or manufacture of numerous tools, and with the present industrious and skillful force of workmen, he is of opinion that the instrumental equipment of the Survey can be greatly improved and added to during the next few years.

T h e annual report of Mr. F. H. Parsons, Chief of the Library and Archives Division, is accompanied by tables showing t h e accessions made t o the Library and Archives during the fisc'al year. T h e Library is now well accommodated in t h e , building No. 2 0 1 New Jersey avenue, and Mr. Parsons has classified the books by general subjects according to the Dewey or decimal system, with the exception of the United States Government publications, these being arranged by the DCpartments and Bureaus from which they emanate. Good progress has been made with the card catalogue of the Library, about I 700 cards having been written out. Mr. Parsons has maintained a correspondence with various scientific societies, by means of which he has been enabled to obtain many numbers of periodicals needed to complete sets of publications. H e has also made arrangements with several his: torical and scientific associations for exchanges of their publications with those of the Survey. T h e number of books presented to the Library and received by exchange was 339; the number. purchased was 157; the number of pamphlets and serials presented and received by exchange was 2 172; the number purchased was 679. There were presented to the Library and received by exchange 974 maps, and one map was purchased. Mr. Parsons observes that the acquisition of standard works on local history and copies of early maps of the States and counties is much to be desired for the Library, owing to their bearing upon questions relating to the location of boundaries., H e reports that considerable progress has been made in the work of re-arranging the Archives. T h e astronomical and geodetic records are being arranged by States, preparatory to binding. A valuable addition to the Archives has been the receipt from some of the field parties of a l a r g e ncmber of photographs both of the localities of their surveys and the instruments employed; these, with the negatives accompanying them will in time form a n important feature of the records of the Survey. I n the Office Division under t h e immediate direction of the assistant in charge, Dr. Wm. B. French continued to servt as executive and financial clerk until February 3, 1893, when he resigned to pursue his profession as doctor of medicine. Dr. Frcnch had been connected with the Survey for more than twenty-three years, and left it much to the rcgret of his official chief and of all with whom he pad been associated. Mr. A. B. Simons, his successor, has rendered very satisfactory service. The leaves of absence records, and those of freight, express, and registered mail were kept by Mr. E. 13. Wills. Miss Kate Lawn, Miss Sophie S. Hein, and Miss Ida M. Peck served as typewriters. Mr. W. B. Chilton continued to serve as clerk in the oflice of the Superintendent. H e aided in the proof-reading of the annual reports and prepared for the printer the abstracts of contents and indexes thereto.
A B S T R A C T O F T H l i A N N U A L REPORT 0 1 : T H E HYDROGRAPHIC INSPECTOR.

T h e assignment of Lieut. Commander Seth M. Ackley, U. S. N., as Hydrographic hspector, Coast and Geodetic Survey, was continued during the fiscal year. I n his annual report t o the Superintendent, which is published as Office Report NO.2, he submits a summary of the hydrographic work executed by the naval parties under his supervision on the Atlahtic and Pacific coasts, and presents a tabular statement giving full statistics of these surveys; refers to the work accomplished by the Hydrographic gnd Coast Pilot divisions of his office, and urges the great need of providing new vessels to take the places of the older onks, which each year require increased expenditures to keep them in serviceable condition. Referring to the detachment on May 8, 1893, of Lient. Robt. T. Jasper, U. S. N., from the charge of the Hydrographic Division, he observes that he can not speak too highly o f the valuable services rendered by that officer in carefully formulating the work of his division, particularly in the method of chart corrections. Since his detachment, and up to the close of the fiscal year, no officer had been detailed by the Ikpartnient to take his place.

Lieut. Commander Ackley alludes to ,the loss `sustained by the Survey in the death, on May 24, of Mr. E. Willenbucher, senior draughtsman of the Division, who had been continuously in service for over thirty-three years. Lieut. h. H. Tillman, U. S. N., submits the annual report of the Coast Pilot Division, which was under his immediate charge during the fiscal year. T h e chief work accomplished was the prcparation for thc press and the proof-reading of the volume entitled "United States Coast Pilot-Atlantic Coast-Part 111-From Cape Ann to Point Judith," and the compilation of the manuscript of another volume relating to the coast and waters between New York Harbor entrance and Chesapeake Bay entrance, including New York and Delaware bays. At the close of the fiscal year the volume first named was in the hands of the printer all ready for issue, and the greater part of the manuscript of the last-named volume had been prepared. From July I to July 19, 1892, Lieut. Tillman was a t sea, verifying sailing directions and making notes of importance to mariners relating to the several harbors along the coast between Boston, Massachusetts, and Point Judith, Rhode Island. On February 2 0 , 1893, he was ordered to the command of the Coast Survey steamer Emieavor, then a t the Washington Navy yard, and on June I sailed in hkr to Baltimore, and was engaged during the remainder of the fiscal year in making such special hydrographic examinations along the coast as were required for the use of the Coast Pilot. Lieut. Tillman acknowledges the valuable assistance received from Mr. John Ross in the Coast Pilot work, both ashore and afloat.
A B S T R A C T OF T H E A N N U A L REPORT O F T H E A S S I S T A N T I N C H A R G E OF S T A T E SURVEYS.

Under that paragraph in the Sundry Civil Expenses Act approved March 3,1893, which provides for furnishing points t o State surveys, progress was made in geodetic operations during the fiscal year in the States of New Jersey, Tennessee, and Minnesota. T h e report of Assistant George A. Fairfield (Office Report No. 4) summarizes the work accomplished by Professors Bowser, Buchanan, and Hoag, acting assistants, in those States, and gives the amounts expended in each during the fiscal year. Mr. Fairfield's assignment by the Superintendent to the immediate chargel of the State surveys took effect March 27,
1891.
A B S T R A C T OF T H E A N N U A L , R E P O R T O F T H E ASSISTANT IN C H A R G E OF T H E OFFICE OF S T A N D A R D W E I G H T S A N D MEASURES.

T h e charge of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures was continued with Assistant 0. H. Tittmann, under the direction of the Superintendent, from July I , ~ 8 9 2 until , March 2 2 , 1893.. At the latter date, Mr. Tittmann having been ordered to field duty on the AlaskaBritish Columbia Boundary survey, he was directed to turn over the charge of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures to Mr. L. A. Fischer, adjuster. T h e annual report of that office has been prepared by Mr. Tittmann, and is published as Office Report No. 5. It is accompanied by an abstract in tabular form of the verifications of weights and measures made during the fiscal year. Reference is made in the report to the important paper on Fundamental Standards of Length and Mass. This paper, prepared by the Superintendent, was published with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury as Bulletin No. 26. The preparation of the exhibit of Standard Weights and Measures a t the World's Colunibian Exposition included the setting u p and graduation of a so-foot Bench Standard; the gilding of a `` State set " of avoirdupois weights from 5 0 ppunds down, and the making and gilding of a set of metric weights from IO kilogrammes to I gramme. For the arrangement and care of this exhibit Mr. Fischer proceeded under instructions to Chicago, where he remained on duty during the month of May. 8.EX. 1 0 6

An inspection of t h e tabular statement appended to Mr. Tittmann's report indicates how much the `time of his office is necessarily occupied in verifications of measures of. weight, length, and capacity for engineers and surveyors, colleges, observatories, manufacturing firms; for State authorities and for other ,Bureaus and Departments of t h e Government.
SUB-OFFICES.

Sub-ofice in P~iZadclp~ia.-Assistant S. C. McCorkle remained in the Sub-office in Philadelphia from the beginning of the fiscal year until early i n November, 1892, when h e was relieved by Assistant R. M. Bache, and directed to proceed to Washington, D. C. and report to the Superintendent for duty in the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office. Mr. Bache continued in charge of the Sub-office until h e left Philadelphia June 2, 1893, to resume the charge of a party engaged in making a topographical resurvey of Boston Harbor. T h e Sub-office was then temporarily closed by direction of the Superintendent. Assistants McCorkle and Bache, while in charge of it, supplied as usual copies of the charts, tide tables, annual reports, and other publications of the Survey to officers on duty in the city who represented the United States Engineer Corps, the Lighthouse Board, the Branch Hydrographic Office of the Navy Department, etc.; also to the City Engineer and Surveyor; t h e Philadelphia Maritime Exchange, etc. In addition to the duties connected with the Sub-office, Mr. Bache completed for the City the drawing of a map of the City front from his own surveys, on a scale of 1-2 400. Sub-ofice in San 3rancisco.-Assistant George Davidson continued in charge of the Suboffice in San Francisco, except during an absence of six weeks on field duty in August and September at the northwest terminus of the California-Nevada Boundary line, when Assistant Jas. S. Lawson was in charge, Mr. Davidson conferred with his colleagues i n all matters relating to work on the Pacific Coast; answered all calls and inquiries for information, and aided the Alaska Boundary parties in the preparations for their work. H e attended to the repairs of the instruments of the hydrographic parties, and forwarded to the Office such instruments as were called for. T h e annual inventory of instruments and property charged to Mr. Davidson was made out by Assistant Fremont Morse, who had reported for duty December IO, 1892, after completing t h e computation of the observations for azimuth a t Mount Conness. I n February, by direction of the Superintendent, Mr. Morse visited Mare Island, made an inspection of the steam cutter Agassiz, and reported her condition. H e continued-onduty a t the Sub-office until March, when he was detached under instructions to prepare for field service in connection with the Alaska Boundary work. Mr. Ferdinand Westdahl, draughtsman, upon being relieved a t the end of Qctober, 1892, from service with the party of Assistant Dickins, returned to his regular duties at the Suboffice. Later i n the year h e was detailed by authority from the Superintendent to make special hydrographic examinations and surveys a t Port Los Angeles and a t Redondo Beach. These have been referred t o under the notice of the work of Mr. Davidson's party, under a heading i n the ((Western Division." T h e clerical duties of the Sub-office were acceptably performed by Mr. Frank W. Edmonds. He accompanied Mr. Davidson in July, August, and Sep,tember, in the field work of the California-Nevada Boundary line ; assisted in the telegraphic longitude and azimuth operations, and i n the erection of signals on Monument Peak, I ooo feet above the sea level. He took over one hundred photographs to illustrate the country on and near the boundary. His duties in connection with the Sausalito tidal station have been already referred to. Vicente Denis, messenger and porter for many years past, has charge of the equipments of t h e Survey i n the storeroom, and attends to all transfers thereof. H e winds regularly the chronometers and clock in the Lafayette Park Observatory.

T h e following named officers were specially employed under the direction of the Superintendent : Assistant George A. Fairfield, in the immediate supervision of State surveys; Assistant R. S. Woodward, in researches, experiments, and the preparation of reports relating to the efficiency of the Iced Bar Base Apparatus and the use of long steel tapes in base measurements; Assistant Andrew Braid, as executive officer to the Superintendent; Assistant 0. H. Tittmann, in charge of the office of Standard Weights and Measures, and Assistant Edward Goodfellow, in the preparation for publication and the editing of the annual reports and bulletins of the Survey. A communication having been addressed by t h e Superintendent to the Secretary of the Treasury, requesting the assignment of Assistant D. B. Wainwright to duty pertaining to the installation and maintenance of the exhibit of the Survey at the World's Columbian Exposition, that officer was directed by the Secretary to proceed to Chicago and report to the representative of the Treasury Department on the Board of Management, United States Government Exhibits. Mr. Wainwright's instructions took effect April 3, 1893,and he remained in charge of the exhibit of the Survey until June 14, when he was relieved by Mr. B. A. Colonna, the Assistant in charge of the Office, who continued on duty a t Chicago until June 30. T h e following named officers weTe assigned by the Superintendent to succeed Mr. Colonna: Assistant W. H. Dennis, Chief of the Drawing Division: Assistant C. A. Schott, Chief of the Computing Division; Assistant E. D. Preston, and Assistant Edwin Smith, Chief of the Instrument Division. On Mr. Smith's return to Washington, on the 1st of October, Mr. Wainwright was instructed to proceed to Chicago, resume charge of the exhibit, and remain until all arrangements relating to it resulting from the close of the Exposition should be completed. T h e transfer of the Coast and Geodetic steamer Blake from the Atlantic Coast to Chicago was successfully accomplished under the command of Lieut. G. W. Mentz, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, by pontooning her through the St. Lawrence River canals. The Blake having been tor some years past identified with the deep sea sounding and current work of the Survey, special attention was paid to equipping her with the apparatus and instruments which have been mainly employed in sounding a t great depths and in the investigation of the currents of the Gulf Stream. It is gratifying t o be able to state that in about three months after the date a t which this Report was transmitted to Congress, announcements were received by the Superintendent from the Chairman of the Executive Committee on Awards of the World's Columbian Commission that the following awards had been made to the Coast and Geodetic Survey and to the Office of Standard Weights and Measures: I . For the Collective Exhibit of Charts, Maps, Models, Instruments, and Publications. 2. For the charts of the Survey, which are no doubt the best in the world, on account of the perfection of survey, the short time in which they were made, t h e greatness of plan for doing t h e general survey, and the enormous resources that t h e Government put into the work. 3. For a number of improvements in the construction of Theodolites, Levels, and other implements of precision. For a large collection of geodetic instruments of the highest degree of excellence, many of which were improved by members of the Corps, and made in the shops of the Survey. 4. For important improvements in Pendulums for Gravity work, namely: t h e transfer of the knife edges to t h e supports whereby they can be polished or sharpened without affecting the pendulum; for the means of determining the period by the principle of coincidences; for the consequent reduction of size and weight, facilitating transportation and manipulation. 5 .

OFFICE R E P O R T NO.1-1893.
REPORT O F T H E A S S I S T A N T IN CHARGE OF THE OFFICE FOR T H E FISCAL YEAR ENDING J U N E 30, 1893. '

U. S. COAST A N D GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, WASHINGTON, D. C., October 28, z893. SIR : I have the honor to submit the annual report of the Office for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, and along with it the annual reports of the various Divisions thereof, as follows : I . The Computing Division, Assistant C. A. Schott, Chief. 2 . The Tidal Division, Assistant G. A. Fairfield, Chief. 3. T h e Drawing and Engraving Divisions, Assistant Wm. H. Dennis, Chief. 4 . The Chart Division, Assistant Gershom Bradford, Chief. 5. T h e Miscellaneous Division, Mr. M. W. Wines, Chief. 6. The Instrument Division, Assistant Edwin Smith, Chief. 7. T h e Library and Archives Division, Mr. Francis H. Parsons, Chief. T h e details of the work in these several Divisions will be found in the reports of their respective Chiefs. Assistant Spencer C. McCorkle was assigned to duty in the Office by the Superintendent. He has assisted me in attending to some of the various details of the office, and during my absence h a s acted in my place as Assistnnt in charge of the Office. Dr. Wm. R. French resigned his position in the Survey, February 3, 1893, to take up the active pursuit of his profession as doctor of medicine. His services in the Coast and Geodetic Survey have extended over twenty-three years. His duties have always been performed in an entirely satisfactory manner, and it was with sincere regret that I parted with him. His place has since been occupied by Mr. A. B. Simons, who came well prepared by business training, in civil life and in the public service, for filling the position. Mr. E. B. Wills has had charge of the leave of absence account, and of freight, express, and registered mail. Miss Kate Lawn, Miss Sophie S. Hein, and Miss Ida M. Peck, have attended to the miscellaneous typewriting of the Office, and to various other duties. On March 18,Assistant Herbert G. Ogden was temporarily relieved from duty as Chief of the Engraving Division in order that he might conduct one of the combined parties to be engaged on the Alaska Boundary Survey, the Engraving Division being placed under the charge of Assistant Wm. H. Dennis, Chief of the Drawing Division, and Assistant J. Henry Turner being detailed to the Engraving Division as Assistant Chief: On June 1 2 , 1893, Assistant Turner died, and Assistant Dennis was left without any one in his place until after June 30, 1893 On Monday, January 23, 1893, Mr. Charles H. W. Junken, civil expert, died, and on May 24, 1893, we lost by death Mr. E. Willenbucher, one of our ablest draughtsmen. These gentlemen were among the oldest and most trusted employ& of the Bureau, and by their death the public service loses two men, the value of whose services was greatly enhanced by their familiarity with the history of our work. T h e plumbing in the Richards building having been repeatedly condemned, it was determined early in the fiscal year to tear out all of the old work, and to put in sanitary fixtures So distributed as to be convenient to the force. This has been done, and the Office now has sanitary plumbing throughout the building. T h e plumbing in No. 201, New Jersey avenue s. E., was also removed by direction of the Treasury Department, and replaced by new

sanitary plumbing, and in No. 203, N e w Jersey avenue S. E,.. the heating apparatus was entirely removed to make additional room for storage of copper plates and other valuable property in this fireproof structure. The vacant ground south of the Richards building, and now the property of the United States, has been enclosed, and the yard room so obtained has been of much service to us. . T h e deficiency appropriation of three thousand dollars for Office expenses, approved March 3, 1893, has been expended for a new boiler and steam radiators, fire extinguishing apparatus, pumps, and repairs, and I have the pleasure of reporting the building now in good working order, and as safc from fire as the most improved hose, chemical extinguishers, etc.,can make it. This fall, for the first time in many years, the heating apparatus was thoroughly prepared for starting the fires on the first cool spell, so that no time was lost by any of the employ& on account of the cold. We have had much difficulty in securing through the Civil Service, draughtsmen a t a salary of $900 per annum who come up to the requirements for beginners in this service. T h e difficulty arises, I believc, on account of the smallness of the salary. During the year I have acted as Superintendent during such times as you have been absent from the Office, in such matters as required my attention. On June 14, acting under the instructions of the Secretary of the Treasury, I proceeded to Chicago, and was with the Coast and Geodetic Survey exhibit until June 30, on which day I reported to you again at the Office. T h e work of the several Divisions of the Office, and of the several Boards established by you for the consideration of special matters, has progressed without friction, each evincing a desire to render the service as efficient as possible. Respectfully yours, B. A. COLONNA, Dr. T. C. MENDENHALL, Assistad i)r charge o f the Ofice. Superititendent U.S. Coast ana' Geodetic Survey.

COMPUTING DIVISION, JuO IO, 1893.

SIR: In conformity with the regulations of the Survey, I have the honor to submit herewith the usual annual report of the work done in this Division of the Office during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893. The charge of the Computing Division was continued with the undersigned; the changes in its working force were as follows: Louis A. Bauer resigned October 26, 1892; William C. Maupin was detached April 7 , 1893; to take the places vacated by Messrs. Page acd Rauer, Harry F. Flynn on September 6, 1892, and Daniel L. Hazard on September 12, 1892, were assigned to this division as computers. Alexander S. Christie was re-transferred to the division May 12, 1893; and Miss Lilian Pike was appointed computer February 8,1893; Daniel Hurley was appointed clerk April 6, 1893, in the place of Mr. Maupin. Temporary assistance was given by John Nelson, subassistant, between July I , 1892, and May 11, 1893; by Fred. A. Young, subassistant, between January g and March 23, 1893, and by George R. Putnam, aid, between August 20 and September 7, 1892. T h e following temporary cpmputers were on special d u t y : A. Bonnot, July I to September 14, and L.-W.

I attended to the duties, as Chief of the Division, of directing and supervising the computations and reporting the results, and of preparing and furnishing to the office such scientific and professional information or data as were demanded, in connection with the general correspondence of the office, as well as for the use of the field parties; any spare time was occupied with advancing certain computations. Among the reports or papers submitted, the following may be mentioned : The final results for variation of latitude of Rockville, Maryland, werc reported ; also papers on the initial datum level of the topographic survey of the District of Columbia; on the proposed international geographical projects of maps, and on considerations as to the best method of laying down the boundary line between Nevada and California. The computations and discussion of the vertical component of the magnetic force from the automatic record a t Los Angeles Observatory (1882-'89), which had been advanced by Mr. Bauer as far as the application of the correction for change of temperature, were concluded by me, forming Part IV of the complete discussion. I prepared three statistical charts showing the progress of the work of telegraphic longitudes, of magnetic observations, and of lines of spirit levels; a second and enlarged edition on the distribution of terrestrial magnetism in the United States, with tablcs to facilitate magnetic observations, was prepared at the request of the Commissioner of the General Land Office for a new edition of the Manual of Surveying Instructions for the survey of the public lands of the United States ; this paper was accompanied by two isogonic charts for 1890,corrected to date. The duties assigned to me as Civil Service examiner of computers were attended to. Data were furnished for the three globes for the World's Fair at Chicago, illustrative of the distribution of terrestrial magnetism, the gravity stations, lines of levels, and the geodetic arcs, both ancient and modern, for the size and figure of the earth. A specification of the work performed by each computer during the fiscal year, is herewith presented; it is made up from the daily and monthly reports. Monthly efficiency reports of each computer were submitted to the Superintendent. Edward H. Courtenay completed the adjustment of the secondary and tertiary triangulations on the coast of California. south of Mbnterey, 1871-'91; adjusted the later tertiary triangulations vicinity of San Francisco; adjusted the tertiary triangulation of the Hudson River near Newburg; also the triangulation of the coast between the Golden Gate and Ross Mountain; attended to the geographical registers and to the geodetic statistics for the annual report; assisted the librarian in putting together the various computations and rearranging in casesprovided for each State and Territory, the geodetic, astronomic, and magnetic records; also supervised the work performed by Messrs. Kummell and Boutelle, and the clerical work of Mcssrs. Maupin and Hurley. The geodetic data required by the field parties were generally supplied by Mr. Courtenay. Myrick H. Doolittle computed the secondary triangulation of Tennessee; computed and adjusted the primary triangulation of northwestern Alaibaina; adjusted the primary triangulation-figure Ross, Helena, Diablo, and Tamalpais, California, and the main coast triangulation bctween Ross Mountain and King Peak: also one principal secondary station of this locality; prepared abstracts of vertical angles and micrometric measures for difference of heights of stations in West Virginia and in Tennessee and some in northern Alabama, and computed the corresponding heights above the sea. Mr. Doolittle assisted in the Preparation of the annual statistics; prepared abstracts of vertical measures of the main triangulation between Ross Mountain and King Peak, and adjusted the observations for horizontal directions at Mount Conness, California, 1890. Henry Farquhar computed the latitudes of Ironton, Missouri, ~ 8 9 0 of ; Potosi, Missouri, 1890; of Macon, Missouri, 1892, and the telegraphic longitudes of the same stations; computed the latitude of Tokio, Japan, 1875, and the value of the micrometer for zenith telescope latitude observations at Waikiki, Hawaiian Islands, r891-'92, E. D. Preston, observer; cornPuted star places and the latitude of stations Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming, 1892, Yuma,

Arizona, 1892,and in part of Nogales, Arizona, 1892. Mr. Farquhar also deduced the value of the micrometer for zenith telescope No. I, San Francisco latitude, and made out and nearly completed the mean places (in N. P. D.) for 276 stars observed a t San Francisco for variation of latitude, 1891-'92. Louis A. Bauer attended to the reduction to a uniform temperature of 'the scale readings of the vertical force magnetometer at Los Angeles, California, 1882-'89, and was engaged on computation of spirit level observations; he resigned October 26, 1892. Alexander S. Christie was re-assigned to the Computing Division, May 12,1893;computed the latitude observations made a t the Survey Office, Washington, D. C., 1891-'92; attended to some miscellaneous matter, and advanced the computation for latitude of San Francisco, 1891--)92. 3 .Kummell was engaged on computations for geographical positions of secondary Charles 1 and tertiary stations on the coast of California between Point Sal and Monterey, and on the Hudson River near Newburg; attended to miscellaneous geodetic revisions, in particular the abstracts of vertical measures in Tennessee and West Virginia; made some magnetic reductions and computed the line of spirit levels connecting the Los Angeles base with tide water. Mr. Kummell assisted in the adjustment of secondary and tertiary triangulations by solving the normal equations pertaining to the figures, and otherwise advancing these computations. John B. Boutelle assisted in the preparation of data required by field parties; computed triangle sides and geographical positions for the triangulations in California and on the Hudson River as adjusted by Mr. Courtenay; inserted results of computations in geodetic registers; took part in the computations in connection with the discussion of the vertical force a t the magnetic observatory a t Los Angeles; made miscellaneous revisions and attended to the copying of scientific or professional reports and papers. Harry F. Flynn reported for duty September. 6, 1892; was engaged on miscellaneous geodetic computations and revisions; aided in the reduction of magnetic observations a t Los Angeles, and computed the auxiliary triangulation about San Diego, California, 1892. For six months, Mr. Flynn was computing apparent places of stars for the latitude of Waikiki, Hawaiian Islands, 1891-'92, and, during May and June, 1893, attended to the same computations for latitude of San Francisco, 1891-'92. Daniel L. Hazard reported for duty September 12, 1892; was engaged on miscellaneous geodetic computations in California; assisted in arranging computations for ' binding, and in proof-reading of annual report; adjusted the tertiary triangulation ncarviedras Blancas, California, computed magnetic observations made a t Nogales, Arizona, I 892, in Alaska in 1892,and by the longitude party, same ycar. Mr. Hazard also computed the value of micrometer used for heights in Tennessee; assisted in <he latitude computation of San Francisco; computed the triangulation about Tacoma of 1892; computed the telegraphic longitude differences between Helena, Montana, and Yellowstow Lake, Wyoming, 1892; between Seattle and Port Townsend, Washington, 1888;between Seattle and Walla Walla, Washington, 1888; between Helena, Montana, and Walla Walla, Washington, 1888; between Helena, Montana, and Spokane Falls, Washington, 1888; and commenced the computation for difference of longitude San Francisco to Sacramento, California, 1888-'89; he computed, also, the chronometric difference of longitude between Tacoma, Washington, and Sitka, Alaska, from six round trips of the steamer Quem, 1892. Miss Lilian Pike reported for duty February 8, 1893,and was almost exclusively engaged in com'putation for apparent plqces of stars in connection with the latitude variation a t San Francisco during 1891-'92, and in advancing the computation for latitude of the place; some miscellaneous reductions and revisions were made'and some equations were solved.

REPORT O F T H E TIDAL DIVISION O F THE U. S . COAST A N D GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE FOR T H E FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE30,1893.

TIDAL DIVISION, S@femrrber 16, 1893. . SIR:I have the honor to submit the following report of the Tidal Division for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893.
S U M M A R Y OF T H E WORK DONE DURING T H E YEAR.

I. T h e Tide Tables fo'r the Pacific Coast for 1Sg3 were read and revised in proof. T h e Tide Tables for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts for 1894 were prepared for publication, and both volumes were read and revised in proof. I n order to spare the tide-predicting machine for exhibition a t the World's Fair, Chicago, Illinois, the predictions were pressed forward with all possible dispatch, so that before it was wanted for packing up, we were able to substantially complete the predictions for both volumes for the years 1895 and 1896. 2 . A harmonic analysis has been completed for two years of observations a t Sandy Hook, New Jersey; a year a t Tybee Island, Georgia,; and eight months at Newport, Rhode Island. A harmonic analysis is in progress for Portland, Maine; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Washington, D. C.; St. Augustine, Florida; and Cedar Keys, Florida. T h e total workdone on the harmonic analysis during the year is the equivalent for the complete analysis of about six years. 3. `The following work has been done on the ordinary or non-harmonic reductions. T h e tidal observations of nineteen series, the equivalent of about three years of continuous observations, have been discussed by the `` First " or Interval Reduction method. Phase Reductions for four series, the equivalent of about a year of continuous observations, and Declination Reductions for five series, the equivalent of almost a year of continuous observations, have been made. 4. Tide notes have been prepared and furnished for one hundred and nineteen stations for publication on thirty-four charts, and a few current notes for the same.

108

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

5. Requisitions from seventeen field parties have bcen filled, involving the preparation of thirty-two descriptions of bench marks, and tidal data for one hundred and eight stations. 6. Tidal information has been called for by thirty-four persons not connectcd with the Survey, the response to which required the preparation of thirty-one descriptions of bench marks, and tidal data for forty-two stations. 7. The correspondence of this Division was reduced to the writing of only one hundred and sixty-five letters during the year, in consequence of having been relieved of the duty of acknowledging records reccived. 8. An aggregate of about ninc years of record from automatic tide gauges, with about four and a half years of tabulated hourly heights of the sea, high and low waters, temperature 'and density of the sea, and meteorological data; also seventy-nine original and sixty-eight duplicate volumes of tidal observations from staff and box gauges, have been received, examined, and registered. 9. T h e original tidal records in the archives for eastern Canada, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, were arranged in gcographical order and tied into volumes ready for binding. This work will be resumcd from time to time according as our limited forcc can be spared from niore pressing labors, until all our original observations of tides have been prepared for binding. IO. T h e harmonic analysis enables us to separate the tide observcd a t any place into its constituent elements or components, when a sufIicient number of heights have bccn tabulated at equal intervals of mean solar time; but the process, while not in itself very difficult, involves a great deal of drudgery, requiring much time, as well as vcry close attention, to perform. I n order to somewhat lcssen this labor, early in the year 1885,Mr. L. P. Shidy, a member of this Division, devised and prepared for use a set of stencils, consisting of about a thousand sheets of 8 by I O inch well-sizcd and rather hcavy paper, each shcct of which was made to represent a portion of certain tables by means of oval holes o r openings half an inch long by a quarter inch wide. In using these perforated sheets or stencils, they are placed, one a t a time, over the original tabulated heights of the tide, enabling us to selcct mechanically such values as enter into each hour of any component by exposing to view only such readings as are required. Thesc stencils have been in constant use in this Division for about eight years, saving u s f u l l y one-half the time formerly requircd for this work, or in other words, they enable a computer to accomplish at least twice as much in a given time as he could do without them, and with far less liability to mistakes. But their use required half-hourly heights, and the further saving of labor in reducing the original tabulations from half-hourly to hourly heights, as well as certain othcr advantages, induced us to prepare a new set of stencils during the past year. Since our stencils are devised for saving the trouble and time of using tables, the change from half-hourly to hourly tabulations required the computation of ;I serics of fourteen tables showing the various component hours most nearly corresponding to each solar hour throughout a year; that is, representing certain fixed relations between the astronomical elements of the tides. The stencils made from these tables consist of about fifteen hundred sheets of 8 by I O inch paper, or about one and a half times as many as the former stencils, the increase being due to including some of the sm'aller components which were not thcn workcd for. These stencils can be used for the analysis of any series of tidal observations of sufficient length, and 0x1 different series can be used over and over again until after many years they gradually wear out, when they can .be readily replaced from the computed tables.
PERSONNEL O F THE TIDAL DIVISION.

Mr. Alexander S. Christie was in charge of the Division until April 18,1893; later he was transferred to the Computing Division. Mr. B. A . Colonna, Assistant in charge of Office, directed the work from that time until May 9, since which date Assistant G. A. Fairfield has been in charge of this Division, in addition to his other duties.

SII~ I :hnve the honor to subinit the rcport of the Drawing Division, which has remained under m y charge, for the fiscal ycar cnding J u n e 30, 1893. Tlic only change in the personnel of the Division during the year was thc appointment, through Civil Service examination, of Mr. Asa G. Randall as draughtsman, on December 2 0 ,
1892.

The general assignment of work has been similar to that of previous years. Mr. A. Lindenkohl's timc has been occupied in making corrections and additions to the published charts, from recent surveys and information; constructing projections on copper plates for engraving, and in collecting data for replies to inquiries from other De;>artments and the public. Mr. H. Lindenkohl has been engaged in making drawings for charts, to be published by photolithography or engraved, and for illustrations to the annual report; also in verifying proofs of the published charts. Mr. E. H. Fowler has been employed in reducing and making finished drawings for publication, of the survey of the District of Columbia; verifying proofs and projections, and in correcting the drawings of charts for new editions. Mr. E. J. Soinmcr has continucd the drawings for the general sketch maps of progress, on a uniforni scale; and the construction and verification of projections for field use. Mr. D. M. Hildreth was a t work in niaking fafr drawings for charts to be reproduced by photolithography, and in verifying and correcting proof of the engraved section maps of the District of Columbia. Mr. C. H. Deetz was on duty in the field from July I, to December I, since which time he has been engaged i n making fair drawings for charts published by photolithography, i n tracings of a high class, constructing projections, and in clerical work. Mr. G. F. Pohlers has made drawings for maps and charts to be photolithographed, and for illustrations for the annual report. Mr. C. Mahon has been employed in reducing and plotting the surveys of the coast of Louisiana for engraving. Mr. P. von Erichsen has been engaged in inking original topographical sheets, and on drawings in connection with the Coast and Geodetic Survey exhibit a t the World's Columbian Exposition. Mr. E. P. Ellis was on field duty from July 8,1892,to January 31, 1893, when he returned for duty in this Division. He has been cngagcd on drawings for charts, projections, and tracings. Mr. E. S. Mitchell has been employed in making drawings and miscellaneous tracings, and in lettering original topographical sheets.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Mr. Asa G. Randall reported for duty on December 2 0 , and has been employed on miscellaneous tracing, and in making copics of triangulation sketches. A brief summary of the work of the Division is as follows: Drawings were made for thirty-one new charts; forth-three new editions of charts; fiftyfour sketches and illustrations for the annual report. Photographs of original sheets for forty-four section maps of the District of Coluinbia were brought up and made ready for engraving. Fifty-eight projections were constructed for field use; eight topographical sheets inked, forty-six lettered and prepared for approval, and a large number of ininor corrections and additions i-re made for the engraved chdrts. There was also a very considerable amount of work and time expended in furnishing infprmation in response to calls from the public, a list of which is appended for incorporation in Table No. 3. In addition to the above, a t the request of the State Department, drawings were made for twenty-nine maps, which were published by that Department for use in the Bering Sea seal fishery arbitration. On my recommendation Messrs. Deetz and Ellis were sent to the field during the summer and fall of 1892, to familiarize themselves with hydrographic surveying, in order that they might the more intelligently make reductions for publication. T h e result was satisfactory, and both were highly commended by the chiefs of the parties in which they served. I have pleasure in again testifying to the uniform industry and ability of the employ& of the Division. Respectively yours, W. H. DENNIS, Assistant, a i d Chic f of the Drawitrg Division. Mr. B. A.

Total numbcr of impressions - - - - _ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 49 063 T h e force of engravers remained substantially the same as during the preceding year, until April 17, 1893,when the personnel was increased by the employincnt of three additional engravers, viz: TVm. McKenzie, Peter H. Geddes, and David hlorris. They have shown, for the time employed, considerable zeal, and I think their work is very commendable and sat. isfactory. T h e expert engravers have been employed as heretofore on the branches of work they have made specialties, with the exception of such interruptions as were necessary through the corrections arising from resurveys and work of a similar character. The young men who have been under instruction have all made satisfactory progress and add very much to the strength of the Division. Contracts for engraving were given out during the latter part of the year to Messrs. Evans & Bartle, of this city, to engrave four plates, viz: Chart No. 36g5, "Hell Gate and East River, from Blackwells Island to Lawrence Point," scale 1-5 ooo ; Chart No. 201, "West End of Pecan Island to thc Mermentau River," scale 1-80 ooo ; Chart No. 203, Sabine Pass Westward to Longitude 94' 25"" scale 1-80 ooo ; Chart No. 202," Calcasieu Pass t o Sabine Pass," scale 1-80 ooo ; and eight plates of the topographical map of the District of Columbia. T h e work on Nos. 3Gg5, 202, and 203, is far advanced. T h e most important engravings completed during the year were, Chart A? ` I Cape Sable to Cape Hatteras," new edition, being an entirely new engraving in one plate, giving greater detail than was shown on the former edition, scale 1-1 200 ooo ; Charts NOS. 5400 and 6100, embracing the Pacific Coast from Point Buchon to Point Pinos, and extending northward froin Cape Lookout to Grays Harbor, scale 1-200 000.

112

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

In the new editions, the revised plate of Chart No. 7, I ` Cape Ann to Block Island with Georges Bank," scale 1-400 000,was issued, embracing more favorable limits and greater . detail than was shown in the former editions'ol the Chart. A new edition was also published of Chart No. 8, "Approaches to New York, Gay Head to Cape Henlopen," embracing the most recent surveys, scale 1-400 000. T h e engraving of the new edition of Chart No. I 12, embracing a part of Nantucket Sound, Massachusetts, showing the resurvey of the locality, has progressed to such an extent that we will soon be able to publish the chart from the engraved plate. Many of the important plates were materially advanced, including the new Sailing Charts B and C of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and will soon be completed for publication. T h e Mercator Chart No. 5 1 , of Nantucket Shoals, extending westward from Montauk Point; the remaining Harbor charts of the coast of Maine and the Coast Charts of Florida Bay, have been advanced as rapidly as circumstances would permit, and will be completed at an early day. Among the miscellaneous plates finished is the new Progress Sketch, on a scale of 1-7 ooo 000,containing the wliolc United States on one sheet, which is intended to take the place of the 1-10 ooo ooo sketch which has heretofore been published in the Reports, illustrating the progress made in longitude stations and connections and in magnetic determinations, and which was found fo be on too small a scale. T h e new sketch has been engraved as a skeleton map, and can be used as a base chart for the illustration of subjects of a physical or statistical nature without the danger of obscuring the object by the great amount of geographical detail. T h e total output of the Division in the number of plates of charts completed is about what it was during the previous year, with the exception of sixty-four plates completed of the section map of the District of Coluipbia survey, making in all sixteen sections completed, and the actual- work in advancing the engraving of niany plates has been very satisfactory. Under the operation of the Chart Board, certain plates are selected to be engravcd as rapidly as circumstances will permit, and ncw work suggested that would be more desirable than the others that may be in the list. Three of thcsc charts have been worked upon, viz: Chart No. 2 9 9 , "Peconic Bay," Long Island, scale 1-40 000; No. 345, "Robinsons Hole and Quicks Hole," Massachusetts, scale 1 - 1 0 000; and No. 400, " Hampton Roads," Virginia, scale 1-20 000; and the two first arc nearly ready for publication. T h e registration of the photo-lithographic work has been continued in this Division; seventy-five new charts, new editions, new prints, and reprints were furnished during year, making an aggregate of I G 957 sheets. T h e plate printing oficc has continued under the direction of Rlr. F. Moore, foreman T h e force of printers has remained unchanged; with the exception of Jas. I". Dickson, helper, resigned, and the appointment of Louis L. Willianis in his place. T h e requisitions for printing from the chart room have increased during the fiscal year 1893, over the previous year by about 5 ooo copies furnished for distribution, although there were eighteen plates less corrected, and seventy-five.plates more printed, showing that the percentage of corrections was not so large. T h e improved facilities of the printing rooms have enabled 11s to keep u p wit11 the work required, and to do away with the annoyance of several years-back-order list. This is gratifying and shows conclusitely that the refitting of the printing rooms has overcome the serious annoyance of previous years and allows the prompt issue of the charts to the public. T h e electrotype and photograph rooms have continued under the charge of Mr. L). C. Chapman, assisted by Mr. L. P. Keyser. T h e average quantity of work has been turned out..

T h e general clerical work of the Division has been performed by Mr. John H. Smoot in his usual acceptable manner; the correspondence and detail work in regard to photolithographing by Mr. Eugene Rhodes, who has discharged his duties very satisfactorily. T h e Chief of the Engraving Division, Assistant H. G. Ogden, having been ordered to Alaska on special duty early in March, 1893, I was designated by the Superintendent to take charge of the division on March 2 6 , with Assistant John Henry Turner, Acting Chief. Under this arrangement the work of the Division progressed to the entire satisfaction of the Office; but unfortunately for the office and the service, Mr. Turner was taken sick June 2 and died June 12, 1893. For the remainder of the fiscal year the work was executed under my personal supervision. T h e usual statement of plates of maps, charts, diagrams, etc., completed, continued, or begun during the year is hcrcwith submitted for file in the archives. Respectfully yours, W. 13.

T h e total issue is 3 per cent larger than thi of last year and I per cent larger than the average of the four previous years, but the net sales, i. e., the gross sales less charts returned by sale agents, have decreased, bcing 7 per cent in copies and value lcss than those of last ycar, and I I per cent lcss in copies and 8 per cent in value as compared to the average of the four previous ycars. Consequently the free distribution shows a corresponding increase. The decrease in sales may partly be accounted for by the fact that the number of new charts published has been only about half that of the previous year, as new charts have at first a ready sale. T h e distribution of charts to libraries for the information of the public in general, referred to in my last report, was to be made in accordance with the following plan, as approved by the Superintendent. After consultation by lctter with the several United States Senators, from a majority of whom answers were received. one hundred and twenty libraries were selected, apportioned among the States according to population, but not less than two to any State; to each of the libraries (excepting four previously supplied) an inquiry was addressed as to their wish for the charts and ability to care for them and make them accessible to the public, and in case of a favorable answer, each was to be furnished, as soon as practicable, with about 160 charts including the most important, and eventually with a complete set, about 500. Of the one hundred and sixteen addressed, twenty-eight have not answered, three have declined, and eighty-five have accepted, of whom forty-five have been supplied, so that there now remain forty to whom charts have not been sent. The distribution was begun in October last and has been continued as rapidly as was consistent with the filling of our current orders. A new edition of the Chart Catalogue is in press, and its publication may be expected in the near future. It is desirable, and I believe practicable, to publish a new edition each year. In the past year 780 copies have been distributed. T h e correspondence for the year has amounted to 3 206 letters written. The members of the Division as a body, have shown, as heretofore, an earnest desire for the success of thc work and have labored faithfully to insure accuracy in the correction of the charts and promptness in filling orders. T h e routine of the Engraving, Hydrographic, and Chart divisions has been so systematized and so carefully executed that there are now fewer orders for charts unfilled (technically called back orders) than a t this season in any previous year within niy knowledge, and this is the busiest season of the year. In accordance with my suggestion made in December, 1892, a project was approved by the Superintendent for the preservation of one copy of every print of each chart published by

this Bureau which has been used as a,standard by the Hydrographic Division, and on which are shown the various hand corrections applied to the charts from time to time in the intervals between the prints. The object is to provide a complete reference file of charts issued by this Office, and the value of such a file is unquestionable. The standards, when no longer needed by the Hydrographic Division, will be stored in the Archives, and, as soon as arrangements are perfected, will be shelved for ready reference. Two new charts from copper plates and fifteen new lithographic charts, seventeen in all, h a w been publishcd during the past year, as shown in the following list, viz:

I repeat the remark made in my report of last year that the term ( I new chart" as used in the above list has a general signification s n d refers to charts never before issued in that form. T h e Same term may be applied by other Divisions to charts which have required new work on the plates, drawings, etc., and which may have been issued before, and there may consequently, for this and other reasons, be a discrepancy between their lists of new charts and mine. The receipts, issues, and general distribution of charts during the year are given in a table which accompanies this report, and which is submitted for file in the archives. Respectfully yoiirs, G E R s H 0M B R A D FOR D, Assistatit, and Chief o f the Chart Division. Mr. B. A. COLONNA, Assistwit iti charge o f the Ofice.

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the work of the Instrument Division during the fiscal year ending. June 30, 1893: This Division has to send out, receive, and account for all instruments and general property used in the field and in the various Divisions of the Office; make the needed repairs to instruments; plan and construct new instruments; determine their constants SO far as it is practicable to do so at the Office, and purchase new instruments and all the material necessary to the work of the Division. T h e force for the year has bcen as follows: Edwin Smith, assistant, and Chief of the Instrument Division. Frank A. Cook, clerk from July I , 1892,to March 25, 1893. Wm. C. Maupin, clerk from April 6, ~ 8 9 3 to , June 30, 1893. Wni. West, messenger. E. G Fischer, chief instrument maker. Otto Storm, instrument maker. Wm. Gaertner, instrument maker from July I to April 30. Jacob Schwarz, instrument maker. W. R. Whitman, instrument maker. S. A. Kearney, instrument maker. C. E. Regennas, instrument maker. M. Lauxmann, instrument maker. Clement Jacomini, instrument maker, appointed June 30, 1893. 13. 0. French, carpenter. Geo. W. Clarvoe, carpenter. C. N. Darnall, carpenter. On account of the vacancy among the instrument makers caused by the resignation of Mr. Gaertner on April 30, the services of one man for two months were lost. Mr. Jacomini,

who was appointed on June 30, comes to us with a very fine record and it is believed will prove a very valuable acquisition to the shop. It is always difficult to find an instrument maker with the experience and skill required i n the Coast and Geodetic Survey instrument shop. During the month of June, 1893, Mr. Otto Storm was on duty a t the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and his services were lost to the instrument shop during that time. T h e instrument and carpenter shops are essentially repair and experimental shops, and the construction of new instruments is incldental to this work, being mostly confined to such instruments as can not be purchased in stock or made to order except a t very much greater cost and delay. Tables I and I1 accompanying this report, give statistics of repair and new work, and Table 111, a list of instruments and apparatus purchased. These tables are submitted for file in the Archives. Two hundred and twclve requisitions have been received from field parties and the Office. To fill many of these, several days' work of several men were required, and in case of the Alaska parties, several wceks of the entire force. This work is only in part shown in the table of repairs. The usual amount of work has been done for the office in the care of clocks, and electric bells, in building cases in the Chart Division, making file cases, drawing boards, etc., and such general repairs about the building as could be done by the men of the instrument and carpenter shops. This class of work is always made subordinate to the regular work of the Division, but at times seriously hampers it. An unusual demand has been made upon the Division this year in the preparation of the instrumental exhibit for the World's Coluinbian Exposition and has caused the setting aside of several pieces of new and important work long since recommended by the "Advisory Board on Instruments and their Construction." I t is hoped these may be taken up this coming year, especially the new Universal Instrument and the new Combination Transit and Zenith Telescope;" also the new `< Half-Second Reversible Pendulum " proposed by the Superintendent. Theodolites h'os. 145 and 146, which were begun in 1890,were completed this year. T h e long period over which work on these instruments has been extended is due to the fact that but one man was engaged upon their construction and he was frequently called upon for other more pressing work. These numbers belonged to two Iz-inch direction theodolites which were purchased some years ago. They never gave satisfactory results, and in 1890 it was decided to make certain radical changes in them. As t h e work progressed, many difficulties were met, and it finally resulted in constructing the two instruments now bearing the numbers 145 and 146. T h e instruments are practically entirely new, though parts of the old instruments were used. During the spring of 1893,these instruments were examined and tested by Assistant R. S. Woodward, who has made his report to the Superintendent. This report shows that they are decidedly the finest theodolites ever in possession of the Survey, It is especially shown that t h e dividing engine of t h e Survey will make as fine graduations as can be made anywhere at this date. I must here state that very great credit is due to Mr. E. G. Fischer, the chief instrument maker, for the perfection of their design and their fine graduation, and to Mr. Otto Storm for the fine workmanship upon them. T h e new magnetometers Nos. 1 7 , 18, 19, and 20, were begun in the autumn of 1891 and completed in the spring of 1893. As on the theodolites, the greater part of the work on these instruments was done by one man, who also was called upon for much other work. These instruments are very elaborate, and though similar in principle to the older forms, are quite new in design as to some parts, and it is thought they will prove superior t o any other magnetometers used in the Survey. T h e two duplex base bars, Nos. 15 and 16,were begun in 1891,but soon had to be set aside on account of other work. They were finished early in the present year, and were

made from designs prepared in the Instrument Division from plans and specifications presented by Assistant Wm. Eimbeck. They were made with the greatest care, and it is believed their use will thoroughly test the principle involved. Plane-table alidade No. 85 was designed and constructed in this Division during this year, after specifications furnished by the Topographical Conference of 1892,and other sources. I n the construction of the two theodolites, the four magnetometers, the two duplex base bars, and the plane-table alidade, it has been the aim to produce instruments superior to anything of the kind heretofore made. I t is intended to give a detailed description of them (with illustrations) in an appendix to the Superintendent's report for this year. During the previous year planes had been substituted for knife-edges in the three pendulums of the " Half-Second Pendulum Apparatus A," and a knife-edge placed in the support upon which to swing them. T h e experimental work with this apparatus extended into the present year and led to the construction 'of three new pendulums known as A,, As, and AG, with planes instead of knife-edges, and to the reconstruction of the support, so that the knife-edge is now in one piece instead of being divided as formerly. During the latter part of the year, by the Superintendent's direction, an experimental " Quarter-Second Pendulum " and support was constructed. This pendulum is as nearly as possible of the same design as pendulums Aq, As, and AG,but of only one quarter the size. Its construction involved some very precise and minute work. Experiments with it have shown that such small pendulums can be used for the determination of relative gravity with very great precision, and a complete apparatus with three small pendulums will be constructed next year. There has been no year since the Instrument Division has been under the charge of the writer (1889) in which it has turned out so great an amount of work, but this work has been of such a character that it is difficult to show it in this report. Fully one-half the time of the entire force during the year has been devoted to preparation of material for the exhibit of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the office of Standard Weights and Measures a t the World's Columbian Exposition, and the fitting out of the Alaska parties. During the year the facilities of the instrument shop have been materially increased by the addition of numerous tools, some of which were made in the shop, and some purchased. T h e efficiency of the Division is now probably as great as can be hoped for with its present force, and if the present standard can be maintained, it is believed the instrumental outfit of the Survey will be greatly improved and added to during the next few years. Throughout the whole year the division has been pushed to its utmost capacity, and I must express my gratification with the industry and faithfulness of its employ&. A detailed account of each day's work of each employ6 is kept on file. The books and accounts of t h e Division and t h e inventories of the field parties are now in a very satisfactory condition. Respectfully yours, EDWIN SMITH,
Assistant, a d Chief of the Iustruaienf Division.

LI~RAR AN Y I ) ARCHIVES DIVISION, Se,btetnler

12, 1893.

SIR:I transmit herewith tables* showing the accessions made to the Library and Archives of this Office during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, together with this, my general report of the improvements introduced, and the work performed in this Division during that time. In December last, the new shelving for the library was completed; this was erected according to my own arrangements, the general style followed being that recommended in the publication called "Library Notes," as *`thebest form for a small library where economy must be observed." A number of firms were consulted, and bids obtained, samples of various kinds of wood and iron shelving being submitted; but owing to the difference in price we selected the wood. As soon as the shelves were completed the books were moved into building No. 201 and placed on them. In making this change, the library was classified by general subjects according to the Dewey or decimal system, with the exception of the publications of our own Government-these wcre divided under the Departments and subdivided by the Bureaus by which they were published. After six months experience I think that I can say that the plan has been a success, and I should make but few changes were I to begin anew. In making the transfer there were brought to light many series of publications (more or less complete) which needed binding; these have been prepared and sent to the bindery, and when they are returned we shall find that the shelving will soon have to be increased. In my last report we had books numbered froni 3 ooo to I I GIS,a total of S GrS. This list now extends from z 490 to 1 2 523, or I O 033 volumes, and many of the old books are yet unnumbered. Upon the arrangement of the books on the new shelves the work of making a new catalogue was commenced. The old "author and title system" is adhered to, but the cards are all written with the typewriter. Good progsess has been niade on this work; about I 700 cards have already been made out. A new card catalogue case has been provided, with a capacity of 2 2 500 cards. T h e purchase of new books has been continued to the extent of the allotment made for this purpose, and, although the number does not appear very large, the standard of the books is so high as to make the library more and more valuable to those who may desire to refer to it for the topics which come within the field to which we confine ourselves. Among these are several sets of Mathematical Journals, which are scarce and not to be found in ordinary libraries. The total allotment for the library during the past year was $ I 731, and the amount expended will come within this s u m after the bills are all received. By correspondence with various scientific societies, I have obtained many numbers which have added to the completeness of our files of Transactions, Proceedings, etc., and have also arranged for exchange with a number of others whose publications will be of value to us. I have found a set of the "Memoirs" which were prepared by this office during the Civil War for the use of the Government vessels. These werc really Coast Pilots; and in order to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy, these was only a very small edition prepared, and these were numbered; so that each volume was accounted for. These are of great historical interest as showing the importance of the work of this Bureau in time of war.
* Tho80 tables are filed in the Archives. A suniinary etatomont of records roceived in the Archives and of accessions to the Library during the fi~oal year nccornpmies this roport.

T h e map library is consultcd very frequently both by persons in o u r own service and those from outside. I would call attention to the desirability of the development of this feature of our library. This Office is one of the recognized geographical offices of this country, and of the world, and should be supplied with books and maps respecting the geography of its vwn country. This information is necessary for the proper conduct of our own business; and that it is expected of u s by the public, is shown by the constant inquiries which we receive, many of which we are unable to answer. In 1853, Lieut. E. R. Hunt, U. S. A., presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Science a project for the formation of a geographical department of the Library of Congress with special features which would have covered the ground which I think this Office should now take. But, as the policy of that library is " n o t to devote itself to the special subjects which the ` Scientific Bureaus ' of the Government naturally would take up," no attention, so far as I am aware, resulted from Lieut. Hunt's efforts. In 1856, Mr. J. G. Kohl gave a lecture a t the Smithsonian Institution, advocating a Cartographical Depot with a small library on the same subject, and in this he has sketched what appears to be a well-digested plan for it, and brings to bear in his advocacy the various advantages which would accrue from such a n institution, among which that of boundaries is specially touched upon. He calls attention to the fact that the early maps of the States and counties are rapidly becoming more and more scarce, and that in the study of the boundaries, reference must constantly be made to maps of old dates. . At this time this ofice represents the Unitcd States on at least three International Boundary Commissions, viz : The Northeasterit, the Mexican, and the Boundary between Alaska and the British Possessions. In the first case, the arguments used in the debate upon the fixing of the boundary require reference to every map of the sastern coast from its discovery to 1818, and when we come to look into the subject there is but little on file in this office which might give light thereon. T h e Mexican Boundary is more reccnt and therefore we can show a little more. We have Emory's Report but no copy of the maps which should accompany it to make it plainly intelligible. As to the Alaska Boundary, we have Cook`s and Vancouver's voyages and also the maps of Tebenkoff ; we have also the British Admiralty maps (which show very little), and a very few maps by the Russian Admiralty, by no means a complete set. Of the western coast we have little or nothing previous to our own surveys. T h e Spanish maps of that section are not represented. I would suggest that a set of Bancroft's History of the Western Coast should be purchased; this at least gives the results of research among those publications. T h e matter relating to the adjustment of State boundaries is often referred to this office for adjustment, and for such work we should have standard local histories and maps. I can recall work of this character done for the States of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Nevada, Wyoming, and Montana; some of which is still in progress. All publications on these subjects should be found on file in this office ; but they are not here, and furthermore, they are not in any one library in this city. Harbor Surveys and the Commissions which have them in charge, Shellfish Commissions, and other similar Boards, directly affcct this office and their publications and literature are entitled to a place on our shelves, for they may a t any time be needed for reference b y our own people. Our reading room is used by many and is growing in popularity, I should judge, from the number of persons who use it. T h e work of re-arranging the Archives has been slow, owing to several causes: ( I ) Very little could be done until more rooni could be provided, and this could not be accoinplished

until the books of the library proper could be moved out of the way; (2) the want of sufficient force made it impossible to press the work, and, (3) the fact that no heat can be introduced into that building made it impossible to work there during the severest weather of last winter. Still, considerable progress has been made. T h e Tidal records for the whole of the New England States have been arranged for binding and are either a t the bindery or have been returned. T h e Astronomical and Geodetic records are being divided geographically by States preparatory to binding. T o prepare these and also the Sounding books (which very much need binding both for preservation, convenience of access, and for compactness in storage) is a very large undertaking, and more help is absolutely necessary. T h e work done by this Division has greatly increased. More articles are now deposited in its keeping, and since the office force has experienced thnt things which are here placed can be found when wanted, they come much oftener to refer both to records and books. We have received quite a large number of photographs from our parties, both of scenery and instruments, which illustrate t h e methods and progress of the work of t h e Survey, and which will prove very valuable. Many negatives have also been turned in, showing that these will soon form an important feature of our records. A set of lantern slides from some of the above has been prepared, and these have been used by various lecturers during the past year. Yumrnary o f records received in the Archives i?t 1892-'93.

REPORT O F T H E HYDROGRAPHIC INSPECTOR FOR T H E FISCAL YEAR 1893.

UNITED STATES COAST A N D GEODETIC SURVEY, OFFICE OF THE HYDROGRAPHIC INSPECTOR, WASHINGTON, D. C., October 30, z893.

SIR:I have the honor to make the following report in regard to the hydrographic progress of the Survey for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, so far as it pertains to the Naval parties who were working under my supervision. There is also given a synopsis of the movements of, and the repairs made to the vessels of the Survey, with a list of their officers, and a table showing the various changes among them during the year. As the Chief of the Hydrographic Division was detached from the Survey shortly before the end of the fiscal year and no other officer ordered to fill his place, no report has been made by the Chief of that Division. The report of the Chief of the Coast Pilot Division is appended.
HYDROGRAPHY-ATLANTIC

COAST.

At the opening of the fiscal year thesteamer Blake, Lieut. C. E. Vreeland, IT. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding, was a t work finishing a small uncompleted part of the resurvey of Nantucket Shoals. On the completion of this work she proceeded to Boston Harbor, and on July 1 1 began the execution of hydrographic work between the entrance to Boston Harbor and Cohasset Harbor. This work was completed on September P I , and she was ordered to proceed to the port of New York, where, on October 1 1 and xz, she took part in the Colunibian Celebration. Between October 1 7 and 2 1 , she was engaged in making an examination of the southeastern slope of Hatteras Shoals. On December z she towed the schooner Drryt from Norfolk to the Washington Navy yard, where she remained until April 2, preparing to go to Chicago. On April I , Lieut. C. E. Vreeland, U. S. N., who had successfully commanded the BZake for the past three years, was detached by order of the Navy Departmentl and Lieut. Geo. W. Mentz, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was ordered to command her, and on April z she sailed for New London, Connecticut, and was engaged until April 17 in assisting in the trial trip of the U. S. s. Deti-oil,after which she proceeded to Chicago, Illinois, where she forms a part of thc Coast Survey exhibit a t the World's Columbian Exposition, and was still there a t the end of the fiscal year. On July z the steamer B a c h , Lieut. E. M. Hughes, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, Commanding, was directed to proceed to Boston, Massachusetts, and on July 1 1 this party began the hydrography of the main entrance to Boston Harbor. This work was most successfully continued until September 30, when the work was closed and the B a d e proceeded to New York. While there, an examination of a reported shoal off the foot of Twentysixth street, East River, was made on December 6, and on December 31 a survey was made of the dredged channel leading to Ellis Island, New York Harbor. On March 23, Lieut. Hughes was detached from the command of this vessel by order of the Navy Department, and he was succeeded on June I by Lieut. Robt. G. Peck, U. S. N. On March 30, the B a d e was directed to proceed to New London, Connecticut, and assist in the trial trip of the U. S. S. Detroit. She was engaged on this work until April 1 7 when she returned to New York and was placed in the hands of contractors for extensive repairs, which she was undergoing a t the end of the fiscal year.

UNITED STATES COAST A S D GEODETIC SURVEY.

From July I to 21, 1892, the steamer Endeavor, under the command of Lieut. L. K. Reynolds, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was engaged in Coast Pilot work, and from July 23 to 30, in making examinations in Long Island Sound. On August 1 1 the party commenced hydrography at entrance to Boston Harbor, which was continued until October 2, when the season's work was closed and the vessel ordered to the Washington Navy yard. On December 9, Lieut. Reynolds was directed to determine the position of a new lighthouse on t h e shoal off Maryland Point, Potomac River, also position of new lighthouse on Sharkfin Shoal and Hoopers Strait. On the completion of this work the vessel returned to the Washington Navy yard, where it was frozen in for the most of the winter. On the evening of February 15, Lieut. Reynolds, the commanding officer of the Ew'ca-dor, was struck and so severely injured by cable cars on Fifteenth street, NW., that he died early the following morning. Lieut. E. H. Tillman, U S. N., the Chief of the Coast Pilot Division, was directed to assume command of thc Em'cazior, and from May 2 to the end of the year, this party was engaged in Coast Pilot work and making examinations of reported dangers in Long Island Sound and rivers and harbors on thc coast of Maine. T h e schooner Rqyre, Lieut. W. F. Low, U. S . N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding, has continued the survey of Boston Harbor cominenced last year. T h e season's work was closed November 30, 1892, and the vessel wintered at the Boston Navy Yard. On May g , 1893, work was recommenced in Boston Harbor and continued until the end of the fiscal year.
HYDROGRAPHY-PACIFIC

COAST.

Const o f Wnshington.-On account of want of officers the services of the steamer Gedtley were not available until late in the season. On Junc 6, 1892, Lieut. Lucian Flynne, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, took conimand of the vessel, and on July 14 he was instructed t o proceed to Puget Sound, wherc Assistant Gilbert with a triangulation party were received on board. T h e vessel and party were engaged on the triangulation of t h e Strait of Fuca until October 2,1892, when the work was closed and the vessel went to Tacoma, Washington, for the winter. On May 19, 1893, the work was again taken u p and a t the cnd of the fiscal ycar the party was still in the field. I n addition to assisting Mr. Gilbert, Lieut. Flynne determined the position of sunken rocks reported off Point Wilson and near hiliddle Ground, Puget Sound.
A L A S K A EXPLORATIONS.

T h e steamer Pattersoti, Lieut. Commander W. I. Moore, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding, having wintered a t San Francisco, sailed for Alasltan waters on April IO, 1892, and at the commencement of this fiscal year was engaged in the survey of Keku Strait and Frederick Sound. This work was continued until September 2 0 , when the Prlttcrsoll returned to San Francisco. This party again sailed for Alaskan waters on April 13, 1893, stopping at Port Townscnd, Washington, where a part of the officers and men of the civil parties to be engaged in the Alaska Boundary Survey were received on board. I n company with the steamer H a s s h t h e parties were conveyed to points in southeast Alaska, after which the Patterson proceeded to Sitka, where this party began a survey of Sitka Harbor and approaches, and was engaged upon this work a t the end of the fiscal year. T h e steamer 1McArthur, Lieut. W. P. Ray, U. S . N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding, having gone to Alaska in company with the steamer Pattcrsoiz and Haasslcr, was engaged in executing the hydrography of Dixon Entrance north Of the boundary, and the southern part of Revillagigedo Channel. On September 23, the season's word was closed and the party returned to Puget Sound in company with the Patterson and Nasder. As the machinery of the McArthur was i n need of quite extensive repairs it was considered advisable to send her to San Francisco. On the way down the coast, while steaming with a perfectly smooth sea, the outer end of the propeller shaft broke off and the propeller went t o the bottom. Ensign George was immediately dispatched to the niouth of the Hum-

ALASKA BOUNDARY.

The steamer UussZer, Lieut. Giles R. Harber, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding, sailed from San Francisco for Alaskan waters on April 16, 1892. At the beginning of the fiscal year this party was engaged in making a hydrographic survey of Yakutat Bay and in malting trips about once in two weeks to Sitka for chronometer comparisons in connection with the determination of the geographical position of Mount St. Elias. Assistant McGrath and party having finished their work, thc season's work was closed on September 2, and the ifasslcr towed the stcanier Cusmos to Port Simpson. From this point the liimsler, Pattersort, and AlcArihur returned to Puget Sound in company. The Nuss/er then proceeded to San Francisco where she underwent much needed repairs during the winter. On April rz, 1893, this vessel again started for Alaskan waters having on board stores and a number of people connected with the boundary survey. On April 18, they arrived a t Tacoma, Washington, where the I-Iydrographic Inspector joined the party. On April IS), she left for Departure Bay with the schooner Earnest in tow to be used as a coal hulk for carrying coal to Alaska. At Port Townsend, Washington, an additional number of officers and men, to be en'gaged in the boundary survey, were received on board. On April 23, the HassZer with the launch Fuca in tow, and steamer Patterson with the Earnest in tow, started north, the latter having been loaded with 1 2 5 tons of Departure Ray coal for the use of the Nossler during the season. She was finally moored at Wrangell, where she remained until the end of the fiscal year. The various parties on board wcre landed a t their destinations, the last being a t Sitka on May 15. From this time on until the end of the fiscal year, the Hnssler was engaged in carrying chronometers for time observations between the Sitka Observatory and the observatories at Taku Inlet, Wrangell, and Burroughs Bay. Lieut. Jeff. F. Moser, U. S. E., reported a t the office March 24, 1893, and was employed on special duty, and during the absence of the Hydrographic Inspector in Alaska, from April 6 to the end of the fiscal year, hc acted as Hydrographic Inspector.

HYDROGRAPHIC DIVISION.

During the past year, until May, 1893, this Division has been under the charge of Lieut. Robt. T. Jasper, U. S. N., and I can not speak too strongly in favor of the valuable services rendered by this officer in carefully formulating its work, particularly in the method of chart corrections. Lieut. Jasper was detached by order of the Navy Department on May 8, and from that time until the end of the year no officer had been detailed to take his place. Mr. Eugene Willenbucher, the senior draughtsman of this Division and one of the longest in service of the employ& of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, died on May 24, 1893. M r . Willenbucher had served continuously for thirty-three and one-half years, and I feel sure that t h e Survey has had few, if any, more faithful servants.

On account of the detachment of Lieut. Jasper, and there being no officer to fill the position of Chief of Division, the usual annual report from that Division has not been made, but I would respectfully call your attention to the recommendations made in Lieut. Jasper's report of the previous year. The following represents approximately the amount of work performed by the draughtsmen of this Division during the year: Plotting original sheets Verification of reduced drawings - - - - - - - - - - - - - - l'erification and correction of proofs - - _ _ _ _ _ _ together with a vast amount of miscellaneous work.

This division has been under the charge of Lieut. E. H. Tillman, U. S. N. For further information in regard to the progress of this important work I would respectfully refer you to Lieut. Tillman's report, which is appended.
REPAIRS A N D M A I N T E N A N C E 0 1 . ' VESSELS.

T h e larger class of steamers now belonging to the Survey, with the exception of the P a t t c m m , may now all be classed as old, and each year require a greater sum total to keep them in a serviceable condition. T o do this the annual appropriation of the past few years of $25,000, is not adequate. If some new vessels are not provided to take the places of the older ones, at least $10,000 additional will be necessary. T h e Blake is in as good condition as a wooden vessel of her age could be expected to be. Her crank shaft is out of line and her cylinders should be re-bored and lined up. A steam cutter should be providcd for her. T h e extensive repairs the Bachr is now undergoing, including new engines and boilers, will put that vessel in good condition for a number of years, so far as her hull and engines are concerned. She also requires a new steam cutter for hydrographic work. The stcamer E&eavor is in fairly good condition, but requires some repairs to shoes, ruddcr, and engine. The usual small repairs have been made to the schooners E a p e , Trawit, Spy, and Quick. T h e steamer Hitchcock, having laid up for a number of years at Morgan City, Louisiana, Was found to be unworthy of repairs, and by your direction was sold at public auction in March last. The schooner Dn;ft was returned b y the Lighthouse Board, and during the summer of 1Sg2 was loaned to the State of Virginia for use in making a survey of oyster beds in the Waters of that State. On May 20, 1893,she was again loaned to the Lighthouse Board for temporary use as a light-ship. On thc Pacific Coast, the steamer Patlevson has been as thoroughly repaired as the funds available would permit. She has had three new lower masts, the boiler has been re-tubed, and a new bronze propeller has been substituted for the old cast-iron one, which was badly eaten away by galvanic action. T h e Paffersou's hull is in good condition except the spar deck, which has been badly strained, and was too light when she was built. The boiler is now nine years old, but can be made to last a few years longer. Such repairs as could be made with the funds available were made to the steamer HassCer, and her economy of steaming was very much improved by putting in a new main valve. Thc N a s s l c r is now more than ,twenty-five years old, and her iron hull is much corroded. 1 do not consider her seaworthy for outside work, although she is perfectly good for use in the inside wntcrs of Puget Sound and southeast Alaska. She has been supplied with a new steam whaleboat.

UNITED STATICS COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The McArthur is laid up for want of money to repair her, having broken her shaft while on her way from Alaska at the close of thc last working scason. T h e steamer Gedncy has had ncw furnaces put in her boiler, considerable necessary repairs made to her engine, and is now in fair condition. I would respectfully recommend that the schooner Yukon and steamcr Nclcn be sold, as they are both in need of extensive repairs before they can be used again, and I doubt whethcr the Survey will have further use for them. Mr. J. H. Roeth has satisfactorily performed the clerical work of this office during thc p a d year. Very respectfully, S. M. ACKLEY, Liezit.

REPORT O F T H E COAST PILOT DIVISION FOR T H E FISCAL YEAR E N D I N G J U N E 30, 1893.

UNITED STATES C o s x A N D GEODETIC SURVEY, WASHINGTON, D. C., October 19, 1893. SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the work of the Coast Pilot Division for thc fiscal year ending June 30, 1893: From the beginning of the fiscal ycar until July 18,1892, I was on board the Coast Survey steamer E?zdeavor verifying sailing directions and making notes of importance to mariners relating to the different harbors along the coast between Boston, Massachusetts, and Point Judith, Rhode Island. On July 19, I again resumed my duties in this office. From July 2 0 , 1892, until January 3, 1893, the Division was mainly cngaged in colnplcting the 1 reparation of manuscript for a Coast Pilot volume, treating of the coast, harbors, and navigable watcrs bctween Cape Ann, Massachusetts, and Point Judith, Khode Island, and on the lattcr date the manuscript was sent to thc Superintendent to be approved for printing Thc first galley proofs from this manuscript were receivcd from the printing office on April 19, 1893, and thc proofs of the indcx on June 1 7 , following. At the close of the fiscal ycar tlie final correctcd proofs were in the hands of the printer, and it only rcniained to print and bind to have tlie volume ready for issue. T h c title of this voluine when issued will bc, "United States Coast Pilot-Atlantic Coast-Part 111-Prom Cape Ann to Point Judith," and i t is onc of a number of volumes intended to form parts of a general Coast Pilot designed to embrace the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, but issued in parts in order the sooner to give the information collected to the public. From January 3 until April 19, 1893, the Division was engaged in compiling manuscript for a Coast Pilot volume to cover the coast and watcrs between the entrance to New York Harbor and the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, including New York and Dclawarc bays. , From April 19 to May 25, 1893, thc Division was engaged mainly in reading and correcting proofs of manuscript then going through the press. T h e greater part of thc manuscript for the Coast Pilot volume to cover the coast and watcrs bctween Ncw York Bay and Chesapeake Bay entranccs has been prepared, but a considerable amount of labor is necessary in order to embody in this manuscript field notes, and to bring the whole up to date. On February 13, 1893, I was ordered to the Coast Survey stcanier Em'euvor, and on February 2 0 , to comniand that vessel. On Junc I , I sailed with the Xmleavor to Baltimore, and during the remainder of the fiscal year was cngaged in executing instructions of thc Superintendent and pcrforming- Coast Pilot work afloat in connection with special hydrographic examinations. Mr. Eugene Veith was employed in the Coast Pilot Division from the beginning of the fiscal year until August IO, 1892,when he left the office for other work in obedience to

131

instructions from the superintendent. I t gives me pleasure to commend Mr. Veith as a careful, neat, accurate, and conscientious worker. Mr. John Xoss was employed in this Division from December I , 1892, to the end of the fiscal year, June 30, but in obedience to the Superintendent's instructions reported for duty on board the Coast Survey steamer Xkz'eavor on May 25, to assist me in work afloat. It is a pleasure for m e to acknowledge the valuable assistance Mr. Ross rendered me in my work both ashore and afloat. He is a zealous, quick, accurate worker, and his term of service in the Coast Survey has specially fitted him for Coast Pilot and hydrographic work. Mr. Talbot Pulizzi was employed as a copyist in this Division during the entire fiscal year. Besides copying manuscript he has had to post files relating to Coast Pilot work, and has perfbrmed his duty in a conscientious and satisfactory manner. Very respectfully, E. H. TILLMAN, Lieutenant, U.S.N. Assistatrt iti charge Coast Pilot Division. Lieut. Commander S. M. ACKLEY, U.S. Navy. Hydrographic liispector Coast ~ t i d Gtodetic Survev.

OFFICE R E P O R T NO.4-1893.
REPORT O F T H E ASSISTANT I N CHARGE O F S T A T E SURVEYS FOR T H E FISCAL YEAR 1893.

UNITED' STATES COAST A N D GEODETIC SURVEY. WASHINGTON, 1 ) .C., October 19,r893. SIR:I have the honor to submit the following general report of the operations of the different parties under my charge, engaged in work .under the item in the Sundry Civil Act, entitled '' For furnishing points for State Surveys, etc.," for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893. Respectfully yours, A. FAIRFIELD, GEORGE Assistant in charge of Stafe Surveys. Dr. T. C. MENDENHALL, Sujerintendent Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washingtori,D.C.

STATE O F NEW JERSEY.

T h e work in this State has been continued by Prof. E. A. Bowser. On July 13,Prof. Bowser's party took the field in the southern part of the State, and after erecting the necessary observing poles, the occupation of Taylor station was commenced on the 20th. All the observations at this station were completed and the party moved to Colson station on August 29,a t which station the observations were completed on September 3. During the month of August the work was computed up to date and the geographical position of the new Lippincott station (1892)determined. T h e computed distance and direction from the new station of 1892 to the old Lippincott station (1843)was then laid off on the ground, and upon digging down 18 inches the old underground mark, an earthenware cone, buried there in 1843 by Superintendent Hassler, was found intact. This cone had been searched for, but without success, by several persons, a t different times, i n d i t was believed that it had been dug up and destroyed long ago. At my suggestion Prof. Bowser tried the foregoing method of finding it, and met with success. An observing pole was erected over the old station and angles were measured on it from Taylor and Colson. From September 3 to 13, Prof. Bowser was engaged in the erection of a pole 65 feet high a t the old Burden station ; in the re-marking of Lippincott (1843)by sinking the cone lower in the ground, and erecting a stone monument over it as a surface mark, and in making a reconnaissance between Lippincott and Burden stations to determine the necessary height of the scaffold signals to be erected. On September 13, field work for the season was closed and the party returned to New Brunswick. From the zzd to the 30th, the Professor was engaged in office work incident to the season's field work. On June 21,1893, the party again took the field and was engaged until the end of the month, as follows: Adjusted signal a t Taylor station; erected signal a t Berlin station; built a

32-foot tripod and scaffold signal a t Pine Hill station ; erected a signal a t Mt. Holly station,and opened the line from there to Pine Hill station. Expenditures for the fiscal year $I 031.44.
STATE OF TENNESSEE.

T h e work in this State has been continued by Prof. A. H. Buchanan. At the close of the fiscal year, June 30,1892, he was in the field engaged in reconnaissance to extend the triangulation along the northern boundary of the State, eastward, to a connec- . tion with the Blue Ridge triangulation. On July 18 he had completed this work by the erection of signals a t Roan Mountain and Big Butt stations, and had gone into camp at Short Mountain and commenced observing there. Observations were finished a t this station on August 15, when camp was moved to McLean station, and observing was begun on the 22d. During the month a pole was erected a t Buzzard station, and the lines to other stations cleared. The Professor reports that while a t this station he had one remarkably clear day, when he saw distinctly with the telescope the pole on Roan Mountain, 84 miles distant. Observations at McLean were finished September 3, and by the loth, camp had been packed and stored, King station in Kentucky had been marked, the party had been disbanded and had reached their homes, and field work for the season was closed. T h e Professor was engaged until the 20th of the month in office work at his home. On December 22, he left his home in Tennessee for Washington, in compliance with instructions from the Superintendent ordering him to the Office for conference. He reached his home again on January 2. On June 5, 1893, h e again took the field, and after a slight change in his scheme, rendered necessary by further reconnaissance, he erected signals a t Mount Rogers and Roan High. Bluff stations. At the close of the fiscal year he had just got into camp a t White Rock Station on the Virginia line, and was ready to commence observing. His expenditures for the fiscal year amounted to the sum of $I 456.03.
STATE OF WISCONSIN.

No work was done in this State this year. On May 12, 1893, Prof. Davies was instructed by the Superintendent to send to the officeall instruments and other property then in his possession. This he did, and the expense of packing and shipping amounted to $11.62, which was the only expense incurred during the fiscal year.
STATE O F MINNESOTA.

T h e work in this State has been continued by Prof. W. R. Hoag. A t the close of the last fiscal year he was engaged in running a line of precise levels from a permanent bench, established a t St. Paul by the Mississippi River Commission, to the ends of the Snelling Avenue Base and to the University Azimuth station a t Minneapolis. During July, 1892, he completed this leveling and established permanent bench marks i n Minneapolis. H e also re-marked and made sketches a t several stations, and erected a tripod and scaffold signal, 32 feet high, a t Wabasha station. During August he erected the following tripod and scaffold signals, viz: One 24 feet high at Lake City station, one 44 feet high a t Maxville station, and one 24 feet high a t Maiden Rock station. H e also occupied Maiden Rock and Vasastations, and partly occupied Wabasha station. T h e observations a t the latter station were finished on September 4, and on the 5th the party returned to Minneapolis and field work for the season was closed. During the winter months Prof. Hoag was engaged a few days each month, when h e could spare the time from his University duties, i n bringing up his office work.

From June I to 25, 1893, he was engaged in making magnetic observations with the declinometer compass and determining the positions of secondary points for use in the topographical survey of the State. While doing this work the Coast and Geodetic Survey paid Prof. Hoag's salary only, on account of the magnetic work. All other expenses were paid by the Board of Regents of the University from a fund allotted for that purpose. His expenditures on Coast and Geodetic Survey account during the fiscal year were $ 1 263'47. Recapitulation of the expenditures of the different parties during the fiscal year 18921893:

REPORT O F T H E A S S I S T A N T IN CHARGE O F T H E OFFICB OF S T A N D A R D W E I G H T S A N D MEASURES FOR T H E FISCAL YEAR 1893.

UNITED STATES COAST A N D GEODETIC SURVEY, OFFICE OF S T A N D A R D W E I G H T S A N D MEASURES, WASHINGTON, D. C., Nmiember zo, 1893.
SIR:From July I, 1892,to March 22, 1893, the Office of Standard Weights and Measures was in my charge under your direction. Upon the latter date I was relieved by Mr. L. A. Fischer, adjuster, who, in addition to the regular duties of his office, remained in charge during my absence on the Boundary Survey in Alaska. Much of the time of the office was given to the preparation of the exhibit for the World's Columbian Exposition. I n connection with the arrangement and care of the articles, which included the setting up and graduating of a 50-foot Bench Standard, Mr. Fischer was ordered to Chicago, where he remained on duty during May. Mr. C. A. Harbaugh was on duty as assistant messenger throughout the year. An important Bulletin (No. 26), prepared by the Superintendent and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, was issued in April. It made formal announcement that this Office regards the International Prototype Metre and Kilogramme as fundamental Standards from which the customary units, the yard and pound, are to be derived in accordance with the Act of Congress of July 28, 1866. During the year special attention was given to gilding brass weights. Among others a so-called State Set of avoirdupois weights, from 50-pound down, was gilded for exhibition at Chicago; and a set of metric weights, from xo-kilogrammes down to 1-gramme, was made and gilded. A hollow kilogramme of gilded brass, having a volume equal to one cubic decimetre, was also constructed. I t is designed for use in adjusting litres, and can also be made to serve as an auxiliary instrument in weighing to determine the correction for buoyancy of the air instead of making barometric and thermometric observations, An important and time consuming piece of work was successfully accomplished in connection with a tv-inch steel linear standard intended for the Watertown arsenal, and sent to this Office by the Chief Ordnance Officer of the Army. T h e bar was graduated and the errors of the resulting lines were determined, a task necessitating the addition of stops to the Saxton Dividing Machine, and their adjustment a t proper distances apart.
WEIGHTS A N D MEASURES FOR THE STATES.

Upon requisition of the proper authorities, Weights and Capacity Measures were adjusted for the State of Ohio, as well as a set of weights for Rhode Island. Other calls for verification and information were met by this office as indicated. in the accompanying abstract. Yours very respectfully, 0. H. TITTMANN, Assistant Coast and Geoa'ch'c Surucy, in charge of O#cc of Standard We&hts and Measures. Dr. T.C. MENDENHALL, Superintendent U.S. Coast and Geodeh'c Survey and of Standard Wetghk a d Measures.
