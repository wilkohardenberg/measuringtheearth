UNrI'ED STA'l'ES CoAS'l' AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washingt01i, D. C., December 23, 1881. Sm: I have the honor to transmit herewith a report of the operations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey of the U uited States for the fiscal yt'ar ending June 30, 1881. Owing to the death of Mr. Carlile P. Patterson, LL. D., my predecessor in office, before his annual report was made, the duty of preparing this account of the operations of the survey carried on under his direction has devolved upon me. The work along the unsurveyed portions of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts has b~en well advanced, and, as means would permit, the exploration of the coast of Alaska has been continued for the correction of the charts and sailing directions of that Territory. Valuable magnetic, current, tidal, and sea-water temperature observations have also been obtained along that coast. In the interior States anti Territories the triangulation along the thirty-ninth parallel of latL tude w connect the Atlantic and Pacific coast s,ystems of triangulation has been carried forward from several points simultaneonsl,v, and the geodetic schemes of both coasts have been extended inward, with the object of an ultimate junction of the whole work into one connected system. Incidental to these operations, a line of geodetic levels has been extended from the eastern coast towards the Pacific, from which, eventually, subsidiar;y lines will be carried to the primary triangulation points with a view to a final reduction to the sea hwel. The validity of all geodetic work depending i11 a great measure upon our knowledge of the exact figure of the earth, measurements of the force of gravity by means of tbe pendulum have been continued as heretofore at suitable stations on the Atlantic coast. For the execution of this importwt, and difficult work improvements ham recently been devised in methods and instruments employed, promising in the future results of a greater accuracy and precision than was hitherto attainable. In connection with the party sent to Point Barrow, in the Arctic regions, under charge of Lieut. Henry P. Ray, U. S. A., by the War Department, for the purpose of establishing a meteorological 'observatory at tbat extreme northern point of the American continent, an observer trained a,t this office for pendulum obsen·ations, and supplied with the needful instruments, was engaged to accompany the expedition and make a series of observations at that locality. Similar obser\'atious will also be made by the expedition to Lady Franklin Bay, and the magnetic elements will be observed at both localhies. Telegrapbic longitudes of several points in the interior have heen determined during the year. The methods and apparatus used in telegraphic longitude work have also Leen considerably im· provt·d, reducing the probable error of a determination to a minimum. Progress in this branch has been greatly facilitated by the co-operation of the telegraphic companies, which have afforded every assistance iu regard to the exchange of signals o\·er their hoes. The magnetic survey of the United States has been advanced by numerous observations at interior and outlying statiomi, and the data thus obtained will form a valuable addition to our knowledge of the present condition of the magnetic declination in the United States and of the laws which goveni its change. The great demand for these results from all parts of the Union is sufficient evidence of the practical importance of the wor·k. The developn1ent of the Gulf Stream, Gulfof Mexico, and Uarihbean Sea by deep-sea soundings, serial temper.i,tures, current observations, aml dredgings, bas been efficiently continued b_y Commander J. R. Bartlett, with the party on board the steamer Blake. The results of this work will he noticed in detall under its proper head. A new electrical a\lparatus for recording serial temS. Ex. 49--1

'fhe fiel!l-work of Assistant Dall, on the coast of Alaska, will he fillly noticed in the body of this report. Prof. \Villiam Ferrel has conti1rned his rneteorological researches for the Coast Pilot, and has colllpleted a i;econcl \ olnme 011 that su hject. He has also prepared a paper on barometric hyp. Rometr,Y and a chapter on the practical application of the formula deYeloped. The suryey of the oyster-beds in tht> Cl1etmpeakc Bay wa:; commt-ncrnl hy this Snrwy in 1878, the general object being primaril,Y to determine the po itions, limits, formation, and g·rneral features of the principal o,yster localities, and, incidentally, to gather all a\·ailable information in regard to the growth of the oyster au<l tht' cornlitious fifforable for it,; propagatioll, a:; well as those hadng a contrary tendency. This work was hegun under tlle direction of Lieut. FrPderick Collins, l). H. N., and was afterwards taken up by :Master l~rancis "''inslow, U.S. N., in the Coast and Geodetic Surwy 8chooner Palinurus. The re1;ults of his labors lrnYe been ernbodit>(l iu one of the Annual Uq1orts of the Fish Corn missioners of tlw State of J\1aryland. (See also Appernlix 12.) Ou the detachment of )fast.er "'inslow from the Snrvej· in .JannaQ·, 1880, the work was taken up b,1 .Assist· ant (}ershom Bradford, who Jw,.; contiuucd it with Yaluable results to the close of the year. In order that the Coast and Geodetic Hurwy might he represented at tlie meeting of the British Association for the Adrnncernent of Science to be held at York, England, in the mouth of August, and for the purpose of irn'estigating seYeral important scie11tific problems cognate to the work, Jh. 'l'homas Cmig was directed in .April last to proceell to Euro1w, under authority obtained from the Treasury Department and with special instrnetious from tl1is office. Dr. Craig sailed for Europe earlj' in J\Ia;y, and at the close of the fiscal j'Par was engaged in carrj·ing out the o~jects of his trip. 'l'l1;e condensed abstract hPre gh,en co11tains a statement of the various localities at which work was prost·cnted during the year, followiug the same geographical arraugPment adopted for the tletai!Pd notices in the holly of this report.

ESTIMATES.

'l'he estimates submitted to Uongress for the service of the next fiscal year are intended to llrOYide for the continuance of surveying operations upon a basis commensurate with the necessities of the work~ and to restore the appropriations to an amount from which t.hey were reduced some years since in a time of great commercial depression. In order that the work may be done most economically, a just proportion must be maintained between the amount. available for fieldwork and that necessarily absorbed in preserving an efficient organization to meet the requirements of the case. An organization which depends for its efficiency on the professional acquirements and years of special training of its members cannot be annually increased or decreased at will in its essential features. It must couform to a certain ~tandard, and be sufficiently large to achieve and make available as quickly as possible results commensurate with the constantly increasing demand for theur arising from, and corresponding to, the rapid growth of the country. These considerations, and the fact that experience has proven the relative economy of the larger appropriations, make. it a duty to point out that a recurrence to the latter is urgently needed.

OBITUARY.

After a long and busy life devoted to sciPntific pursuits, Prof. BENJAMIN PEIRCE, commlting geometer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, <lied at his home at Cambridge, Mass., on October 6,
1880.

Benjamin Peirce was born at Salem. l\Iass., April 4, 1809. He was fitted for college under the i11Rtruction of Nathaniel Bowditch at Andover, and entered Harvard in 1825, immediately evincing a remarkable talent for mathematics. In 1829 he graduated, and shortly afterwards he accepted a position as teacher of mathematics iu Round Hill School at Northampton. In 1831 he returned to Cambridge to fill the position of tutor of mathematics in that university. lie was made university professor of mathematics and natural philosophy in 1833, and Perkins professor of astronomy and mathematics iu 1842. Professor Peirce was appointed Superintenrlent of the Coast Survey at the death of Prof. A. D. Baclte in 1867. Frequent!;\', during many years pre\'ious, Professor Peirce had been called upon to assist in matters connected with the Sur\'e.Y, and the knowledge thus obtaine<l, of the objects and general scope of the work, euabled him to assume this important position with au intelligent apprPciation of its duties and respom~ibilities. During the civil war the regular work of the Survey had been in a great measure suspended. The organization had been preserved merel_y because it formed a valuable adjunct. to the land and mwal forces, but the survey of the coast had ma<le but little progress. The first work of the new Snperintell(lent was to arrange for the continuation of the Survey according to the plans laid down a11Cl the principles already formulated by his predecessor. It was uot long, however, before the influence of his genius and originalit_y, already acknowledged in the highest branches of scientific research, began to be apparent in the conduct. of this national work. The extension of the survey of the coast to a great geodetic system, stretching from oeean to ocean, a..lthough it had been remotely contemplated by his predecessor, was first actually commenced by Professor Peirce, thus htyiug the foundation for a general map of the country entirely independent of detached local sur,·eys. With this object the great diagonal arc was extended from the vicinity of Washington to thP southward and westward along the Blue Ridge, eventually to reach the Gulf of Mexico near Mobile. He also planned the important work, now in active progress, of measuring the arc of the parallel of ;~90 to join the Atlantic and Pacific systems of triangulation; and for determining geographical positions in States having geological or geographical stuveys in progress. To him also helongR the honor of having proposed to Congress this plan for the extension of the Survey to a geodetic survey of the whole territory of the United States. Professor Peirce, while Superintendent, took personal charge of the American expedition to Sicily to observe the eclipse of the sun in December, 1870; and for the transit of Venus in 1874 organized two part.ies from the Coast Survey, one to observe at Chatham Island in the South Pacific Ocean, the other to observe at a station in Japan. As soon after the war as vessels and officers could be had, he renewed operations for deep-sea soundings, and gave his earnest support and assistance to all scientific work in any way related to the Survey. In the ordinary routine of administrative details, Professor Peirce relied on officers of the Surve.r ha\'ing large practical experience in regard to its methods and pl"Ocesses; yet he carefully saw tl1at. tlie work advanced in accordance with his views. After his retirement from the Superintendency in 1874, in order that the Survey might continue to luwe the benefit of his great mathematical knowledge, he accepted the honorable position of consulting geometer, exercising a general supervision over the scientific portions of the work.

Professor Pierce had been since 1849 cousnlting astronomer of the American Epliemeris and Nautical Almanac, and for many years he directed the theoretical part of the work. ln 1855 he was entrusted with the organization of the Dudley Observatory. He received the degree of LI~ . D. from the University of North Carolina in 1847, and from Harvard Unin~rsity i11 1867. Be was elected an associate of the Hoyal Astronomical Society of Loudon in 18,HI, and a memher of the Royal Society of London in 1852. He was made president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1853 (the fifth year of its existeuce), and was oue of the origfoa.l members of the National Academy of Sciences. He was also a member of the Hoyal Societies of l~1li11burgh and Gottingen, and honorary fellow of the Imperial Unirnrsity of St. Vladimir at Kim-. Of the published mathematical writings of Professor Peirce, it may be said that they ratlier indicate the scope of his intellect than give an adequate idea of the vast and intricate labors with which his mind was constantly occupied. Much that he produced was never put into suitable form for publication, and many of his papers that were fhmlly given to the world were merely the coudensed results of successive steps in a wide field of origina.1 research. Yet he was the author of many works of the highest scientific value, notably his work ou aual.'·tical mechauics and his fanear Associative Algebra, besides many text books 011 mathematic8 and physics, and separate art,icles on various subjects. He wrote in a style lticill, concise, entirely free from conventionality, and marked by a wide range of thought. Although his mathematical work claimed the greater part of his attention, he yet found time for exhaustive studies of kindred topics. In physics, astronomy, mechanics, and naYigation his labors are marked by valuable discon~ries and new applications of known principles; and his interest extended equally to logic and metaphysics, to geography aud geology, and eyen to botany aJl(l zoology. In fact nearly all branches of scif'uti1lc inqnir.'· were enriched b.'' bis labors, and iu all he displayed the same profound knowledge and hold originality, combined with keen intuition and great force of intellect. During the year the Survey has suffered the loss of a most accomplished member in the death of Assistant A. M. HARRISON. Mr. Harrison had been for some years in failing l1ealth, but not without hopes of amelioration. He wa..~ seized with an attack of pueumouia at his home at J>lymonth, J\iass., and died, after au illness of a few days, ou .January JJ, 1881, iu the fifty-second year of his age. Mr. Harrison was born at New IIa\'e11, Co1111., l\la.Y 27, 1829. His employment in the SmTey, commeuciug December HJ, 1847, extended with little i11ter111iss:o11 over a period of more tha11 thirty years, devoted to active work iu field and office. In the field he was eugag·ecl chietly iu topography, for whieh he early displayed a spedal aptitude. His skill and accuracy, as well as his great imlustry, are evidenced by the many admirable topographical sheds that bear his name. Mr. HarrisOH was also possessed of literary talents of a high order. During the last years of his life he was OC('llpied in the preparation of a history of the Plane 'l'able. 'l'his task, peculiarly fitted to his tastes, was nearly accomplished at the time of his death. In personal character Mr. Harrison wa,s marked by refinement and culture, a genial temperament, and warm affections, and his rare social attra.ctions wo11 for him many warm and sincere friends.

'l'opography of Dyer's Neck and Petit Jfana,n Point, coast of Maine.-The to1>ography of Dyer's Neck and Petit Manan Point, coast of Maine, was assigned in June, 1880, to Assistant H. G. Ogden, who early in July procee<led to Sullivan, Me., and organizetl a party for the work. The sheet embraces tlie two peninsulas named, which are separated by Dyer's Bay_ The shores are generally rugged, broken with coves bare at low water, densely wooded, and offering few commanding positions. This necessitated much cutting. Two prominent points appear 11n the sheet, Eagle Hill, on Dyer's Neck, and Pigeon Hill, at the head of Petit Manan Point; the latter is threP hundred and eight feet in height, tlie greatest elevation reached. On the extreme end of Petit Manan Point, and for a mile or more on the slwres of Dyer's Bay aml Pigeon Hill Ba~', a "seawall" ha8 been formed by natural action of well-worn stones, ranging in size from pebbles to bowlders, but generally of the dimensions of cobble-stones. The interior slope is quit~ steep, and in some places reaches a height of six or seven feet. Similar natural walls of sand have been noticed on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, but on the New England coast such formations are rare. Subassistant Vinal assisted in the work of the part,y until October 1, wl1en be was detached for work on the coast of Florida. .Field-work was steadily prosecuted until the end of October, when, the sheet upon which be had been engaged being completed, Assistant Ogden disbanded his party. Subsequently he was assigned to the charge of the Engraving Division of this Office.

Work was begun near Lamoine on July 27 upon the sheet commenced during the preceding season, and was continued, with slight interruptions hy fog, until August 12, when the sheet was completed, and a satisfactory connection made with the work of Assistant Hosmer on Skilling River. The party then removed to Sullivan, Me., for the survey of the shores and upper heads of Frenchman's Bay. Work in this locality was commenced August 16, and continued, whenever the weather would permit, until Sep-

Hydrogmphy of the coast of ,l/a.ine, near llfount Desert.-At the cowmencemeut of the year Lieut. S. l\I. Ackley, U.S. N .· Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, with the party on board the schooner Eagre, was engaged in a survey of the Penobscot River between Hampden and "rinterport. Hydrography was completed in that locality on July 6, and the party was transferred to the Bagaduce River for a survey of its headwaters. On the completion of this work the hydrography of Jordan River was taken up and finished; thence the party proceeded to Skilling Rirnr aml surveyed the hydrography of that locality and a portion of Frenchman's Bay. vVork for the season was concluded with a survey of Franklin Ba,y, alJoye and including Sullivan Falls. The general statistics of the season's work are stated as follows: Number of soundings ............ _.................... _................. 21, 0~4 Angles measured...... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5, 146 Miles run in sounding . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35\l~
The very irregular forms of the different bodies of water render difficult a correct estimat.e of the number of i,;quare mile::; <'AJYered by the h,ydrography. In general the season was very fa\·orahle for the execution of hydrographic work, but. 8ome time was lost in going to and from the different localities of work. Some incorrrnnience was also _experienced in obtaining a supply of fresh water, which in Frenchman's Ba._y could only be obtained at the Bar Harbor Water Works, owing to the drying up of the springs and wells. The steam-launch Saga<lahoek was used during the season in the execution of hydrography. The officers attached to the party were Lieut. H. T. l\Ionahon, U. S. N.; 1\Iaster Frank E. Saw~·er, U.S. N.; and Ensign \;Varner Il. Nostrand, U.S. N., all of whom rendered efficient service in connection with the work of the vessel. During the season Lieutenant Ackley examined and reported on the location for a buoy in Mill Creek Reach, Penobscot River~ Me. Tidal observations.-A permanent station for securing a long series of tidal and meteorological observations for the special uses of the survey, and also for scientific purposes, was established at North Haven, off the coast of Maine, in January, 1870, and put in charge of Mr. J·. G. Spaulding, who hafl kept up a very complete set of records to the present time. An excellent self-registering tide-gauge has been used, which is provided with a very efficient heating apparatus to protect it from ice in winter. This has always worked well, eYen in the coldest weather, and has enabled the observer to secure an almost perfect series. When a short stoppage for repairs becomes necessary, hourly readings are made on a staff-gauge. The station being on an island jutting out into the great Bay of Maine, and near to deep water, seems to be one of the lJest that has been occupied for making such observations, and, if the Series can be kept up successfully a few years longer, it will doubtless satisfy all expectations in regard to it. Hydrography of Rockland Harbor, Muscle Ridge Channel, and Skilling's River, Me.-The party under charge of Lieut. H. G. 0. Colby, U. S. N., Assistant, Coast antl Geodetic Survey, with the schooner Eagre, having been assigned in March to work on the coast of Maine, arrived at Rock. land in the latter part of May, and at once commenced a complete hydrographic sun·ey of Rockland Harbor, the soundings being referred to a tide-gauge temporarily established at that locality. At the close of the fiscal year this survey was nearly completed. Lieut. H. T. Mona.hon, Master Frank E. Sawyer, and Ensign Warner IL Nostrand, U, S. N.,

Triangulation of Ne1c Hamp.~kire.-The geodetic station on Mount Washington, marked and 11artly observed upon before the large hotel and other buildings on the summit were crcct-0d, has been of late years so entire].\'· hidden from view that observations for its connection with the triangulation of New Ifarnpshire and of l\faine could oul,y be effected by means of an eccentric signal or heliotrope either on tho roof of the hotel or of the old Tip-Top House. Finally, the scheme having actually surrounded Mount \Vashingkm, the time arrived when it became necessary to occup;r the poiut for tlle purpose of measuring the previomlly concluded angles. A tripod over the station to hold the Lugest theodolite, and a close tower for the protection of the tripod, both higlier than the surrounding huihli11gs, was the only plan that promised to secure the necessary com1rn111d of t11c horiwn, and stability during high winds. Through the instrumentality of Prof. E. T. Quimby, Acting Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, the interest and generosity of Mr. \Valter Aiken were enlisted in the cause, and at his expense, after due consideration of a11 the objects to be aceompJished, the tripod and tower were erected, and were ready for occupation by the middle of August. From ,JnlJ- 1 to the rlate last mentioned, Professor Quimby was employed in co-operating with 1\Ir. Aiken, arnl iu 1mperintl·mli11g the execution of the plan agreed upon. The height and other di111e11sions of the two strncturps are fnJl,r giYen in the iseason'is report of Professor Quimby. From the middle of August to October 1, at which date the hotel was closed, and winter had set in, every hour of observing time was improrn(l. One thousand repetitions were secured, and ah;o three hundred pointings by uising the theodolite as a position instrument. The station, however, was not com11leted. Mr. Aiken, who is one of the proprietors of the summit, has expressed his willingness that. the tower should stand as long as it is needed for the survey. After leaYing Mount \Vashington Professor Qnimhy re-erected certain signals to be observed on from Gile Hill, in Vermont, that being- orw of the stations of the quadrilateral connecting the aistronomical obseiTatory of Dartmouth Colleg(1 with the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey; and by Nornmher :l the desired measurements at Gile Hill, consisting of seven hundred and fifty pointings, were ohtai11ed. Triangulation of Vermont.-Prof. V. G. Barbour, Acting Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, commenced field-work in Vermont early in JnlJ. His first operation was to erect signals at ten of the mountain stations select.ed U,\'' him to be observed upon b,Y the party of Aissistant H,, D. Cutts, then occupying the primary station of Potato Hill. By this co-operation of the two parties angles were memmred at the primary station which will save considerable time and ex1)emie iu the execution of the Vermont scheme. The necessary reconnaissance, marking of points, setting np of Rignals, and the clearing away of obstructions to intervisibility, consumed the month of July. Betweeu August 6 and September 22 the two stations of Herrick and North East Mountain were occupied and completed. At the former five secondary and seventeen tertiary points were observed upon, and at the latter, four secondary and five tertiary points.

Primary triang1tlatwn in Vermont.-At the commenceu1ent of tl1e year, as mentioned in the last Annual Report, Assistant R. D. Cutts was enga.ged in occupying the station Potato Hill in Vermont, heliotropers being posted, on account of the length of the lines, at Bald Ledge and Cube in New Hampshire, at Mount Mansfield in Vermont, and at Bigelow, Blueberry Hill, Cheever, and Prospect Mountain in New York.

The weather at Potato Hill during the month of June and Jul.Y was characterized by heavy storms, with intervening days of unusually clear weather, favorable for observing. Obsen·ations were satisfactoril,y completed at this station by July 24, and the party was moved to the foot of Blueberry Hill, arri\·ing tllere on ,July 30. Between that date and August 6 a winding path was cut two miles to the summit, the hill slopes being too steel!. to admit of a direct course. Hy the 13th camp was 11itclrnd at the summit ready for obserdug. Owing to unfavorable conditions of the atmosphere resulting from a long drought and extcusi\·e fore8t fires, the latter in one instance destroying an important tripod f'igual, tbe work of observing was much impeded. 011 September 20, there being no improvement, tl1e party was transferred t1i the station Chee\·er, one of the Lake Champlain triangulation point;;. By the 27th the ohseI"Vatiom; at Uheen~r were completed, and the difference of lm·el (370.35 fePt) lwtween tlw station and the level of the water of the lake on St'ptember 25 was 1letermined hy the spirit-le\·el, the line beiug leveled forward and hack. On the 30th of SepternbPr Field's Hill was occupied, and by Odober 5 the observations were finii;hed. The line selected for the southern c01mectio11 of t.l1P lake, Cheever-Fields Hill, was the longest of the Lake serim.;, running quite close to the base 011 Crown Point, and including the astronomical azimuth observed some years ago at Cheernr Htation. Thus au interesting comparison of results was obtained, one set derived from l\Ionnts Tom aml Monadnock and the primary base apparatus, and the other from the lake triangulation and thf:' sf:'condaQ· or sliding conta<'t apparatus. From Mount Tom to Fields Hill the distance is ahont one hundred and thirty-five miles. The length of the line Fields Hill-nheewr, m; determined by Assistant Cutts without station or figure adjustment, is 22,403m.5. The same line as given by the cornput.iug division upon a recomputation of thP lake 11uadrilateral is 22,403 111 .5. The leveling executed at CheeYer was <lone for tl1(' purpose of determining how close the trigonometrical leYeling from the ,·ici11it.' of Troy, N. Y., conhl determine the height of the wat.er of T1akf' Champlnin nhorl' the mean tide of the oeeau. " 7 hene,·er the Leight of the lowest stage of water iu the lake shall be determined h;r means of a line of S]lirit le\·eling from the hl'11eh-mark at La118ingbnrg, near Troy, rt cornparisou of' the resnU.s may be made, and the trigonometrical leveling between the two well aiscertainell heights may hfl adjm;;ted, a..i;;: iu the c:t.1':(\ of a triangulation betwef'n two measured bases. The height of Lake Champlain, as giYeu by .M.r. Yerplanck Coh·in, superint<>ndent of the Adirondack Survey, in his report for 1879, is HH.3 feet. This result was obtained from the records of the engineers in charge of the canal from Troy to ·Whitehall. The trigonometrical leveling maket> the height abo,·e mean tide vary from 93.4 feet at extreme low water to 103.5 feet at extreme high water. There are at present no data by which the exact height at any particular stage of the water can be determined. When the occupation of Fields Hill was completed the party waR diRbanded, and .Assistant Cutts, after a rapid preliminary reconnaissance for a further extension of the scheme, returned to the office at Washington.

H. G. 0. Colby, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, with the bydrographic party on board the schooner Eagre, proceeded to Pickett's Ledge, at the entrance of Salem Harbor, Mass., and made a complete hydrographic development of that ledge, soundings being taken at frequent intervals over the whole area of the shoal. These were referred to a temporary tide-gauge at Walnut Cove, and thence to a permanent bench-mark established for the purpose. Tides were also observed at Bost.on, Mass., during the execution of the soundings. .Work in this locality was included between May 4 and May 12. Thence the party Jffoceeded to Rockland Harbor, as noticed in a previous abstract.

Topograph,I/ and Ilydrography of the south coa8t of Long Island.-Tlle sur\'P.Y of the ltays and islands of the south coast of famg lr;land, from the termiuatiou of his work of the preceding season to Fire Island, was taken up hy Assistant J. \\'. Dou11 at the beginning of July, the schooner Scoreshy beiug assigned for the mse of his part,r. Pre\'ious to commeueiug the reg·ular work of the season a snrYey was executed of Coruell's Creek, in Jamaica Bay, a work which was atteucled with ;;0111e difficulty, owing to the inaccrn;sihility of the ground. Aft el' the ;;hort\ liue of the crPck had hePn run, distaneer; on each side were measured and marked at propm i11te1Tals, a1Hl a hempen cord, knottetl for each th1·ee feet of its length, stretcl1ell across from each stake to it,s opposite. At each kuot the depth of wat.er was obtained with a sounding pole marked in feet and tenths. A temporary tide-gauge was erected at the Club Honse wharf, to which the soumliug8 were referred. \Vlte11 thi8 work was completed, A.8sist.aut J>onn waR occupied for a fow days i11 placi11g upon tltc topographical i,;heet of 1879 the extensive improYements made siuce that date at J~ong Beach, includiug the railroad extending from the Beach to East I~ockaway, a dii,;tance of four miles. The part,Y was tlJen tram:fern~d to New Inlet, and au anchorage was found in the ddnity of l~rcevort. In the meanwhile the topographical . work was going 011, and by the close of .l uly ncarl~· all of the marsh and beach work west of the main ch:umel of New Inlet was finislied. The 11,nlrography was commenced in August a])(l steadily continued until the close of the semiou. Some difiiculty wa8 experienced in this work, owing to the fact that soundings could not properly IJc takeu except dm'iug the interTal IJetween two-thirds fiood and one-third ebb-tide, so that rarely more than fom· hours' work could IJe done in the course of each day. The various bays, with their numerous marshy islands, rendered it impossible during low-water to get a IJoat to firm ground. The Scorm1b,r was mo,·ed about the middle of September to an anchorage near Babylon, from which work was prosecuted until the 26th of October. Hy that date all the shore liue and islands were fi11ished, the work connecting on the north side of Great South Bay with the work of Assi8tant Ianlclla, aud on the south with that of Assistant Hosmer. The soundings being completed by the 1st of November tlie vessel sailed for Baltimore. During the execution of the soundings t.idal obserYations were recorded at Babylon, Amityville, and Jones Inlet. The reduction of soundings, a rather difficult task owing to the great difference between tbtc maxima of tides at the inlets, at the beads of channels, aud in the.broad bays, has been successfully tre<tted in the Jlydrographic DiYision of this office.

During the latter part of the ymw Assistant Donn has been emplo~·ed in a survey of the District of Colmnhia, which will be noticed in its proper place under the head of Section III. Tidal obsen1tition1J.-'fhe self-registering tide-gauge at the (lepot of the New Jerse.v SouU1ern Railroad, on Saudy Hook, N. J., has been kept rnnni11g almost continuously since it was set up, in 1875, by Mr. J. ,V. nanford. :Ueing the geuernl manager tbnre lie has great facilities in keeping things in order, and lias gcuerall,Y heen succeRsful. It is a rather difficult placi~, lioweYer, to kPep up continuous ohRervations, })artly ou aecount of the rough1WRS of tlie wah~r, especiall~- tlnriug storms, aml partly on account of the ice in wiut.er. 'l'he fixed parts were strongly bracic'd and :;;eetn to have stood well, but there is 1rneessarily mnch friction of the working 11arts of the apparatus which necessitates frequent repairs. A g·ood mau,Y tides were lost during tl1e severely cold spells of last winter, and it is yery desirable that s0111ethi11g· be done to make t.l1e record more complete in future. The scale has beeu recently c11auged from one-eighth to one· tenth in order to prevent the defect.<; at extreme higl1 and low waters, the range of the titles heing somewhat greater thau 11ad been anticipatic'd, espe.cially wlw11 tLe effects of storms are a.dtled, which are quite large at this JIlace. Special oper<ti'ions.-Tlte work of securing· and re-marking primary trigonometrieal stations in the Hudson RiYer scheme of triangulation having been assigned at the outset of' the fiscal .)'ear to .Assistant F. H. Gerdes, the ear1.)T part of ,July was spent in gathering the necessary records and instruments, and directing tl1e constrnction of granite monuments arnl iron screw-11iles for station marks. Assistant Gerdes was not able to commence tl1is work at that time, owing to the necessity for re-marking triangulation points in tlrn vicinity of Philadelphia, needed in tlte re-sun·ey of the Delaware Hiwir, to wllicl1 duty he was tranRforred, as will he noticed iu au abstract which follows. Ju .Tune he again took the field, arnl at the close of the year was l'ngag<'d in the \Terification and re-marking of the Hu<lson Riwir points. Topography <(ltlte Rud,wn Rfoer.-In previous St'a;;ons t.1w topography of the Hudson River had been advanced hy Assistant Il. L. \Vhiting as far as the vich1it~- of Higl1laml Falls, on tlte west bank. In .July work was rt·sumetl iii this locality on a scale of T<·f.c, 11 , antl carried northward towards West I'oiut. .Five subsidiar~· points in the tria11gulatiou, determined during the season by Mr. C.H. Van Orc1en, Aid, wrre w;;t·d as statim1s from which to extend the plane-table. work. Titese points served also as a hash; for the large scale RnrYey of the immediate vicinity of 'Yest Point. Owing to the ~Teat detail arnl intricacy of the wo1·k, cau:;;e1l hy tlw dense woodH mul brokeu nature of the ground, the sy8tem plHRJH\d bj· Mr. \Yhitiug in thl'I execntio11 of lite topograpl1y was primarily to complete detached porbons of the sm·,·ey at localiticH from which the i11ten·ening portions could be overlooked. The physical features on this bank of the river, altl1ough diversified, are more decided than those on the east bank, the hills and peaks more distinctly separated, and the valle~-s between better defined. Hence the importance of securing at the outset commanding positions, from which the intermediate details could be filled in. The river shore, witl1 its marginal topography, was completed from the bounclary of the government land near Block Honse triangnlati011 station, southward to include Cozzens's Dock and the older lan<iiugs below at Benny Haven's. It includes also the village of Highland Falls, the valley and the creek, which was taken as the bm;t na.tnral boundary between the HJ-iruu sheet and the a<ljoining one to be pn.~jected hereaft.er. This valley ancl creek and the main road along the river bank were sun·eyed back for a distance of about two miles to the J)()int wlJere t.btt road branches, one fork forming t.he oltl road to Newburg, one tbe "Point road," so called, and the third fork leading over Crow's Nest Mountain to Cornwall. 'fhis la.st road is named by Mr. Whiting as the best inlaml weste.rly boundary for tl1e 1 ,»too work of tlie. general river topography. By Augm;t 20 work was nearly completed t~) the limits of the large scale b-t-60 ) sheet of West Point, and the topography on this sheet was at once commencecl. \Vork was Rteadily prosecuted until t~e 7th of necem ber, when tl1e party was disbanded. The scale of 4 loo was sufficiently large to show close details, and rendered necessary the determination of' every station and the measurement of every line and offset within the limit of error of one meter, a discrepancy of that extent being quite perceptible. Ea.ch station was brought into perfect agreement and coincidence with every other from different points and bases, a. task involving much labor. Along the more hidden

and intricate banks forming the Point the numerous paths enabled the topographer to sketch the contour lines with sufficient accuracy. .All levels were referred to the plane of mean high-water at the Coast and Geodetic Survey bench-mark at "\Vest Point, from which also reforence benchmarks were de~rrnined by numerous observations. Every detail admitting of representation is shown upon the sheet. Mr. \\r. C. Hodgkins, .Aid, was attached to the party of .Assistant Whiti11g during the season, and rendered efficient service in the topograplJy. 1\1 uclJ interest in the work was manifested by tlie officers of the .Arm~- stationed at West Point, who aft'orde(} every facility and free use of all <la.ta in their possession pertaining to the survey. Reconnaissance.-As mentioned in the last Annual l~eport, a reconnaissance Wlts made in 1879 by .Assistant S. C. McCorkle for the extension of a scheme of primary triangulation westward from Lake Champlain. The practicability of the sclJeme thus developed not bein~· in all respects assured, .ARsistant C. 0. Boutelle was directed towards the close of the fiscal year 1880 to take the field for the continuation of this work. In June and July Assistant Boutelle examined the country west of Black River and between it an(l Lake Ontario, and found it to be generally a plaili, sloping towards the lake, witlJ no points sufficiently ele"Vated above the general level to lie seen from the surrounding region except })y the use of high tripod signals. The summits Pen l\fonnt (about one thousand eiglit hundred feet above the sea), Steuben Township, Oneida Uounty, and Hommer's Hill, in Turin Towusltip, Lewis County, were founcl to rise above all others, arnl were, therefore, selected as esseuthil points in the scheme. These stations overlooked the wilderness, where there was a prohability of finding points tlJat would overlook the stations Prospect-Marcy in the scheme of .Assistant Cutts. vVesterl~- from Hommer the country appeared nearly h·vel and densel~· wooded, nec1:>ssitating the m'le of high tripods. From Pen Mouut and elevat.iom; in the adjacent region the entire range of mountains south of the Mohawk Rfrer wais visible. Iu view of these facts, Assistant Boutelle proceeded to lay out a Rcheme to the southward of the original scheme, and based upon t.he line Prospect-Heltlerherg, making use of only tlJe sou them stations in the original scheme, and selecting uew points upon the principal crests south of Mohawk Ri\-er. These points were so located as to be available in the future for extending the primary triangulation southward towards the Pennsylvania lim» and nortlJward towards the Saint J,awrence. Ju projecting this 8Cheme muclJ assi8tance was l'Pceived from the primary triangulation laid out and partly executed by the New York State 8Urvey, nuder the direction of Mr. JarneH T. Gardner. Work was continued until the latter part of October, when the weather becoming too severe for field operations the party was disbanded. .At that time obserrntion8 had been completed at Pen Mouut, and were partially completed at Tassel Hill, about one thousand nine hundred feet above the sea. The statistics of the work are M follows: .At Pen Mount six }Jrimary and two secondary stations were observed upon in thirty-three series each upon primaries, and sixteen seriet'I each upon secondaries. 'l'be reforence point was Star Hill i,;ignal of 'the New York State sur\'ey, diRtant 2.44 miles. Double zenith distances of the reference point were observed upon four dars with the vertical circle. Micrometer differences of leYel were observed on three days between the reference mark and all the other stations. Observations were also made for value of eye-piece micrometer. At Tassel HiU geodetic observations were i£)mpleted upon Pen Mount, Otsego, Fenner, and Florence, primary stations, and upon Star aml Barto, secondary stations. Observations were also made for latitude and micrometer differences of le,·el. Field-work was resumed in June, 1881, when a reconnaissance was made to determine the intervisibility of t.he line Otsego-Rafinesque. Observations were resumed at Tassel Hill on June 20, and were still under way at tl1e close of that month. The weather during June was generally unfavorable for field O}lerations. Mr. Thomas P.

Cutts had occupied during the fall of 1880 the two stations, Blueherry Ilill and Chefl·er, in New York, being points in the Lake Champlain scheme of triangulation. He had also made a rncon" naissauce of the country between Monnt Ma11stid1l and the bournlar.r line, including the adjoiuing portion of Canada, in the spring aud fall of the same year; and with the data thus supplied, a scheme for the triangulation, extending as far north ai,; l\Ioutreal, had beeu laid out arnl adopted. In the execution of this scheme, starting from the main stations last occupied, the first work iu order was the erection of tripod signali,; at the uew points selected, and the cleariug of summitH sufticieutly to command the horizon.

Soldiers' Home, French, and Wayland Institute being in tnrn occupied and observed upon. The line Soldiers' Home-Wayland was then made the base for tbe determination of the two additional points, New York Avenue and Kea.ting's. As soon as the projections were available, the topographical work was commenced in the area included between Boundary Street, Fourteenth Street extended, Mount Pleasant A venue, and Seventh Street extended, by the request of the Enginen Commissioner of the District. This work was completed in February and the results furnished to the District Commissioners. Following this the work lying to the eastward of Seventh Street ext~nded and across to Lincoln A venue, conring the locality of the proposed lake and reservoir, was taken up. On the 1st of April a second party was organized and placed in charge of Mr. W. C. Hodgkins, Aid, who had pre\'iousl;r assisted in Mr. Donn's party. Toward the middle of May the two parties were placed in camp near Brightwood, near the principal part of the work which lies in the open country. It was found impracticable to run five-foot contours through wooded areas without extensive cutting. Before moving the parties, Mr. Hodgkins mapped the country north of Mount Pleasant Avenue from Fourteenth Street extended to and across Seventh Street extended. Subsequently he was principally employed in and about the Riggs road, Magnolia Avenue, and Rock Creek Church road. The work of Assistant Donn, from the 15th of .May until June 30, was directed to the exrension of the survey along Lincoln A venue, around the cemeteries and Soldiers' Home, and in the open country along the Bunker Hill, Bladensburg, Queen's Chapel, and Harewood roads. Lines of level were run along all the principal roads and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to the boundary of the District. Owing to the incomplete and at present disconnected condition of the work, it is impracticable to fornish statistics. 'Topography of site for new Xa,val Observator.IJ in tlu; District of Columbia.-Towardis the latter part of May, Mr. Charles Junken, of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, was directed to make a detailed topographical surw.y of the locality selected for the erection of the new Naval Observatory. This site is on the high ground between the Tenallytown road and Rock Creek, about ouehalf mile north of Road Street, Georgetown, D. C. Mr. Junken took the field on June 1, and commenced work by determining the heights of a number of points near the proposed observatory site with reference t-0 the mean high water of the Pot-Omac River. l?or this purpose liues of levels were run from the city engineer's bench-mark, corner of High aud ltuad t:;troots, Georgetown. The lowest point was found t-0 be at the northeast corner of the site, which is 91.5 feet abO\'e mean high water, while the highest l)Oint iis situated a short distance north west of the mansion, being 280. 7 foet above the same plane of reference. This portion of the work was finished by the 13th of June.

a series of triangles with short sides, when situated in the forest, so as to obviate, as·far as possible, the necessity for cutting through the thick undNbrush. Contour lines were then run to show lines of equal elevation for every two foet of vertical height. The field-sheet, on a scale of ffio, being finally completed, the necessary connection with the triangulation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was effected. The sheet, inked by Mr. Junken, was turned ia to the office at the close of the sea.son, together with field-books of triangulation and levelings. A duplicate of the work was then furnished to the Superintendent of the Naval Observat-Ory. Mr. F. O. Donn assisted in this survey.

want of an observer the usual declination and intensity observations in June had to be deferred this year; besides, the observatory was needed for the above-stated purposes, and the dip circle belonging to it had to be g·iven U}l to the Point Barrow party. This instrument, it is expected, will soon be replaced by a new one. Permanent trial b<tse at Fort ..:lfyer.-"'ith a view of haviug a permaneut test line for prelirninary practice of parties taking the field for base measurement, as well as to secure au established line of known value for testing measuriug bars at an,Y time, a permanent "trial base" one kilometer in length has been laid down in the vicinity of Fort l\:lyer, Va. The ends of this line are securely marked, and tlrn marks are at a depth sufficient to be beyond the effect of climatic and hygrometric iutl.uences. As the frequent use of this line requires the ready means of transferring this underground mark to the surface, suggestions as to the best method of accomplishing the purpose were invited, and tlie plau suggested by Assistant 0. H. Tittrnann was adopted. (See Appendix 14.) Pendulmn obserrations.-The pendulum experiments conducted during the year b~· Assistant Charles S. l'eirce have, in great part, related to the effect upon the oscillation period of the "lrnlls of the receiver (or vessel within which the pendulum swings). It has hitherto beeu assumed that this effect is very small, and upon this assumption its value has heen calculated by an approximate h,rdro-dynamical theory. Experiment lias, however, unexpectedly shown that the effect, although naturally not large, is far from being· very small. The mathematical theor~· is thus shown to he ,·ery imperfect, and it has become necessary to determine, experimentally, the effect above referretl to. The alteration of the Yalue of this effect involves alteration in other constants, and has important iudirect results. Certain anomalous determinations of gravity are thus explained, and former ex11eriments made by the Coast and Geodetic Stir\·ey are fouud to be even more accurate thau bad been supposed. A m·w pattern of the reversible pendulum has been invented, ha\ing its surface as nearly as conyenient in the form of an elongated ellipsoi<l. Three of these instruments have been constructed, two hadug a distance of 011e meter between the knife-edges and the third a distance of one yard. It is proposed to swing <;me of the meter pendulums at a temperature near 32° F. at the same time that the ~'ard pendulum is swung at Goo F., in order to determine anew the relation betwr>en tlrn yard and the meter. Tile other meter pemlnlum has been :,;ent to Lady Franklin Bay, under the charge of Lieut. A. "\V. Greely, U. S. A., after having been oscillated at the Coast and Geo1letic Sun·ey Office hj· Mr. Isr:wl, of J,ientenant Greely's part~'· The oscillations were made nuder tlie personal direction of .Assislaut Peirce. Observations to determine the force of gravity have been made at Washington au<l Baltimore. A new Reries of experiments has also been made to test the plan of oscillating pendulums on rollers. The result has been unequivocally unfavorable. Investigations upon the flexure of the pendulum support and upon the plan of swinging two pendulums upon the same stand have been continued. (See Appendix No. 15.) A memoir by Assistant Peirce upon the deduction of the ellipticity of the earth from pendulum experiments will be found in Appendix No. 16. The measures of deviations of light by diffraction plates, forming a part of the work upon the spectrum meter alluded to in former reports, have been continued by Assistant Peirce, who has also made special experiments to determine the influence of the movement of the solar system upon the de,'iation. The results of these experiments and measures will ~ a matter of future publication. Hypsometry.-The work assigned in July to Mr. H.F. Walling was the compilation of a map of that part of the Appalachian chain of mountains extending from the northern part of Maryland to the northern parts of Georgia a11d Alabama, many of the summits of the mountains between these limits having been occu·pied in the primary triaugnlation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. After obtaining all available data from this office and from outside sources, ~Ir. Walling took the field on October 1, in order to complete the collection of necessary information to make such triangulation as might be requirt·d to connect the existing maps and plans in his possession with the trigonometrical poiuts of the survey, and to make barometrical and other observations over the region covered, for the purpose of representing its hypsometry. The area over which work has been carried during the fiscal year comprises that portion of

The location of uine poiuts in the valley between Parr's Ridge all(l the Blne Hidge were iletermined with reference to the Coast and Geodetic Sur,·ey triangulation, and six more point.s between the Blue Ridg·e or South Mount· ain and the North Mountain were partially ohsenerl upon. Contours were drawn for each one hundred feet of difference of le\·el. Over fifteen lnmdred miles of wagon roads were gone over with the aneroid barometer, and differences of le\·el were noted between stream crossings, watersheds, etc. These have been approximately referred to the sea lm·eJ by comparison with heights determined bj· the snrvej· and with the profiles of railroad lines. Profiles of hills and ridges were made by measurements of horizontnl and vertical angles, from mountains whose pm;itions had pre\"iomily been det,ermined, and in mauy cases traverse surveys were made aloug U1e summits or ridge lines and in the ravines, accompanied by records of heights with aneroid barometers, one of which was stationery. Upon the completion of the triangulation mentioned, the sheet containing the map of the territory described, comprising an area of more than sixteen hundred square miles already in au advanced state of progress, may be speedily, completed. Telegraphic longitiides.-After closing observations at Cape May, as noticed under Section II, for the determination of the, latitude and longitude of that place, the part~· of Assistant G. W. Dean remained at \Vashiugtou, D. C., the part~· of Assistant Smith being transferred to Strasburg, Va., where an obseiTators had been erected earlier in the season by Assistant Dean. Bad weather at Strasburg prevented die commi·11cenwut of obsenatiom; for longitude until ,June 14. Longitude oh.serv1ttions between this place aml \Vnsbingtou, D. C., were made on the uiglits of .J111w 14, VI, and rn, when the ohseners changed stations, awl similar determinations were made ou the night8 of June lK, W, and 21. r~atitude ohsPrrntions were ma1le nt Strashurg by Subassistant C. H. Sinclair, with meridian telescope No. 13 011 the nights of ,Tune 7, 8, 14, 15, lG, 18, HI, and 22~ but the nights generally were cloudy and unfi1vorahle. Mr. Carfoslc Terry, jr., was then <lirected to join the party at St,rashurg, and, immediately afterwards, that party remon·d to Charlt·8ton, \V. Va. On J nnc 28 sigua1s were exchanged between vVasbington, D. C., and Cl1arlesto11, W. Va. This was the last work accomplished up to .Tune 30. The results of work during the season have been marked by greatly iucreased accuracy, due to improved instruments and methods. The transits have been fitted with new eye-pieces of high power, and have been reconstructed for latitude ohsen·ations and fitted with new levels. :New signal relays ha\·e been substituted for the polarized relays formerly used, and are found to give satisfactory results for transmission and armature time over both long and short c~rcuits. Jlfa.gnetic observatfo~1'~.-The maguetic route followed by Subassistaut Baylor, under instructions of ,Tune, 1880, was specially marked out with the design of furnishing magnetic information over a vast region, within which, previously, our knowledge of the distribution of terrestrial magnetism was exceedingly scanty, and to supply data for the future to serrn for ascertaining the annual changes of the magnetic elements. The route passes chietly through Northern Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Dakota, and takes in, on the way to and from those States, the special localities in regard to which magnetic information was most needed. The selection of magnetic stations through the States depends, at present, mainly upon the ordinary facilities for travel, since parties with special outfit and protection for inllepemlent action would be far too costlj'. Subassi1>1tant Baylor took the field on ,Jul~- 5 and determined the azimuth and three magnetic elements at Clarksburg, vV. Va. The stations subsequently occupied are specified under their proper section headings. In the following June, Subassistant Baylor resumed field-work, and by ,June 30 had completed determinations of the three magnetic elements at Wheeling, Clarksburg, Parkersburg, Charlestown, and-Alderson, W. Va., Covington and Wytheville, Va., and had partially complet.ed <>bservations at Marion, Va. Triangttkition i1i West Yirginia.-Tbe part.r of Assistant A. T.

tropers, and erecting signals. On July 1, camp was pitched at Briery Knob, Pocahontas County, West Virginia, a station more than forty-five hundred feet above the sea level. Observations were commenced at once and continued until July 24, when the party removed to Keeney Mountain, Summers County, West Virginia. Owing to the steepness of this mountain, the task of transporting the camp and instruments was a difficult one, but was finally completed by August 7. The geodetic instruments were mounted on the 11th, and on the 12th and 13th the astronomical observatory was built and the meridian telescope mounted tor observations of time and latitude. The weather during August, was unfavorable, only one day's observations for horizontal and vertical angles being obtained, but the nights were more favorable aud observations for latitude were finished on September 5. From August 24 until September 22, observations of horizontal and vertical angles by day, and of time, latitude, aml azimuth by night, were carried on simultaneously. Six mileR of road were also cut through the wilderness from Job's Knob to Beech Knob, preparatory to the occu1Jation of the latter. Observations at Beech Knob (over forty-one hundred feet in height) were obtained between October 8 and 21. Snow and very cold weather delayed the operations of moving camp from Reech Knob to Summersville, and during this int~rval Table Rock and Holmes' were cleared of trees, signals erected, ancl heliotropers posted at those stations. Work was commenced as Summersville on November 11, and continue(} until December 6, when work was closed, camp stored at Kanawha Falls, "\V. Va., and the instruments and records forwarded to the office. Before the close of the season the weather became very unfavorable, fourteen heavy snows fell, and on one occasion the thermometer registered -18°. In spite of theRe and other retarding intl.uenceR mentioncrl, Mr. :Mosmau Rucce(>ded in occnpyi11 g· fonr prirnar:r stations, two of which were l1igh mon11tai1Js, fliflicnlt of acces;.;, a result wliicb is to be attributed to his energy and readiness to take advantage of every farnrable opportunity for ohsen·ing. Mr. \V. B. Fairfield rendered effecth·e service in the party as recorder.

AD.JACENT PORTIONS OF

Deep-sea soundings, dredgings, and tempemture obserra,tions.-During the month of June, 1880, the steamer Blake, under command of Commander J. R Bartlett, U. S. ~-, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was thoroughly repaired at Providence, H. I., for the cuntimrntion of the deepsea work of sounding, dredging, and temperature observations. The latter part of ,June was spent in experimenting with a cylinder deYisetl by lJieut. Commander C. D. Sigsbee, U. S. N., for obtaiuing specimens of ocean life at intermediate depths: Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee and Prof. A. Agassiz being on board. · On June 27 the Blake left Providence for a position off the George's Bank, due east from Nantucket. Prof. A. Agassiz joined the vessel on the following day to take charge of the speciruems obtained. Off George's Bank soundings and hauls of the trawl. with observations of surface and bottom temperatures were obtained in depths of from seYenty-two to one thousand two hundred and fortytwo fathoms with excellent results, many of tl!e liaulis lwiug- exceptionall~- rich in animal life. All of these hauls were made with the trawl, aml tbe apparatns worke(l well. Tlte weather generally was very favorable. From the position off George's Bank the vessel moved to a location isouth of NmYport, where hauls were made with good results at deptbs ranging from two hundred and sixty to four hundred and sixty-six fathoms. Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee's cylinder was used to advantage in obtaining specimens of life at intermediate depths. On July 7, after a sbort detention at Newport, caused by bad weather, the vessel saile(l 1or Charleston, S. C. To the southeastward of Cape lfomaiu a souudiug and haul of 1lie dredge was obtained in one hundred and forty-two fathoms. Thence the ves;;;pl steamed to the ea;;;tward, taking frequent soundings in order to find the depths at which Professor Agassiz wished to dredge. The depths on this line were unexpectedly small, the axis of the Gulf Stream being crossed before a depth of three hundred fathoms wa."I found at any somulin~. The bott(Jlu is composed of hard coral, upon which but few traces of animal life were discovered, although along its edge successful hauls were made witl! the trawl. For fifteen miles or more from the one hundred-fathom line a strong current was experienced running to the southwest, dragging the vessel iu that direction, when the trawl was down, at the rate of two knots an hour. Towards the axis of the stream the current took a northeasterly course, running at the rate of 2.6 knots an honr. The water deepened to three hundred and eighty-two fathoms ea.st of the axis, but shoaled again to three hundred and thirty-seven fathoms. As the cruise was primarily for dredging purposes, these soundings were not continued; but the Stream was followed along its axis to the northward, soundings being taken every fiye miles, with depths of from two hundred and thirty-three to one thousand three hundred and eighty-six fathoms, from latitude 320 to latitude 330 30' north. After reaching a depth of oue thousand three hundred and eighty-six fathoms the vessel ran towards Cape Lookout, sounding as far as thfl hundred-fathom line, and taking a number of hauls with the trawl with excellent results. On the way to Hatteras hauls were made in one thousand six hundred and thirty-two, one tl!ousand fh·e hundred and ten, six hundred and three, and one hundred and fifty-seven fathoms. The l>ottom off Hatteras was found to slope too abruptly to admit of any dredging, but very good hauls were made forty miles north of the Cape in one thousand and forty-seven, eight hundred and seventy. six, six hundred and twenty-three, and sixty-fh·e fathoms. The next line dredged was off the Delaware, where hauls were made in depths ranging from eighty-nine to on¥ tl1ousaml one hundred and eighty-six fathoms. These hauls were exceedingly rich in results. The line to the southward

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

of Newport was completed by making hauls at twelve localities, in depths of from one thousand three hundred and ninety-six to twenty-four fathoms. This closing the work as laid out in the instructions for the cruise, tlrn vessel returned to Newport, arriving there 011 July 20. Lieut. U. F. Wandell, of the Royal Danish Na.-y, accompanied the party on board the steamer Blake, and manifested great interest as well as intelligence in regard to the details and appliances for deep-sea soundings. After the return of the vessel to Providence lte expressed in a communication addressed to the Superintendent his cordial thanks for the attention shown by Commander Bartlett and bis fellow-officers in furthering the objects of his trip. During the fall and winter the Blake was laid up at ProYidence, R I., and 110 active work wail done by the party, with the exception of two small local ltydrographic sm·veys for special purposes. In the following spring the yessel was refitted for sea, and recefred on board a new electrical apparatus, devised b;y Siemens, of London, for recording deep-sea temperatures. These preparations being fi11ally complete, the Blake left ProYidence on l\fay 4 for a cruise in the Gulf Stream. The general limits of the work executed durin~ May and June are between Jupiter Inlet, Florida, and Currituck Light-Bouse, North Carolina, between which points lines of soundings normal to the coast were run, extenrling across the Bahama Banks and, after leaving those banks, i11cludin~· the whole area swept by the Gulf Stream. These lines were run out from the coast for a distance of from sixty to three hundred miles, and about sixty miles apart. Along these lines sonndi11gs and serial temperatures with specinwus of bottom were taken at distances of from five to te11 miles, according to the localit;v. No dredging-work proper was attPmpte<l. Hy the end of ,June, at which date this report eloses, two hnrnlre<l and eig-llt sounding stations had lwen occupied, and temperatun·s recorded at se\·euteen stations &1 11i11c liues normal to the coast. The depths on these lines range from seven and one-half fathoms near shore to two thousand one hundred and thirty-four fathoms at the extrernit,y of one of the most southerly lines, and were found to agree well with those taken near the same localities during the preceding season. The Rtrong current previously noticed, setting to the southwest for fifteen miles or more from the lmndred fathom line off Charleston, waR again experienced. On the line out from Savannah and on the return Jiue from Charleston, when on the west side of the Gulf .Stream, a strong "rip" about a mile in width was encountered. During the pre,'ious summer the Bl:tke bad crossed this "rip,' anrl from the reports of pilots and other.s its exio;teuce was found to be well known. The Blake \\-as still engaged in deep-sea work at the close of the fiscal year. The following officers were attached to the Yessel during tlte year, and rendered valuable assistance in the deep-sea work and management of the vessel : I,ient. Charles C. Cornwell, U. S. N., l\fast,ers G. W. Mentz and Ilenry Morrell, U.S. N., Ensigns Lucian Flynne and E. L. Reynolds, l7. S. N. Triangulation, t{)pography, and hydrography of Indian River, Florida.-To continue the survey' of Indian River on the east coast of Florida, Subassistant W. I. Viual started for the field on October 20. Preliminary arrangemen\s, retarded by heavy rains, were not completed until NoYember 16, when the actual field work commenced. The triangulation was extended southward from stations occupied during the previous season, to furnish points for the extension of the topography and hydrography. At the outset it was found that many of the signals erected during the preceding season had been blown down by the hurricane of August 28 and 29, 1880, and in some. cases the river had risen to ~mch a height as to dis1}face the station marks. It was therefore necessary to re-erect and in some cao;es to re-determine the signals at several points. This being accomplished, the regular work was taken up and steadily prosecuted until the close of the season. The weather during the progress of the work was for considerable periods unfavorable, high winds prevailing during five mOn.ths. But little rain fell and the river was consequently low. Extensive tracts were burnt ornr by settlers clearing land, filling the atmosphere with smoke and preventing oboorvations. Much cutting was rendned necessary by the he.avy undergrowth, and scaffold signals of considerable height were found necessary to secure intervisibility. As in fm:mer seasoni;, however, drift. wood was nsed exelusively for building signals, and this was found to save much delay. The western shore of the ri..-er south of "Parks" triangulation point is a long, narrow strip of sand sep. arating the river from extensive marshes, but notwithstanding this the western limit of the topo-

Taney, Aid, was attached to the party, and performed good service in the topography. At the close of the season the Steadfast was laid up in Turkey Creek, and e.vcr~· precaution taken for her safety. Hydrography of Oape Canaveral Shoal,s and south of Oape Oanaveral.-HaYing closed work in th1~ vicinity of Egmont Key and off Light-House Point on the west coast, Lieut. E. B. Thomas transferred his party to the vicinit,y of Cape Canaveral, arrfring tltere on April 18, and at once commenced a survey of Canaveral Shoals, upon a projection furnished by the office. The work was steadily prosecuted, with exceptionall_y favorable weather, and by May 19 the projection covering Canaveral Shoals and two additional ones to the southward of Cape Canaveral were furnished. The vessel then sailed for New York, arriving there on May 23. In addition to the regular work of sounding, a number of bottom specimens were obtain"ed, and were turned in to the office by Lieutenant Thomas with the sounding books and other records of the season's work. The rapid and successful execution of this work is greatly due to the efficient assistance rendered by the officers attached to the vessel. These were Lieut. J. A.H. Nickels, U.S. N., Masters Charles J. Badger, U. S. N., Frank A. Wilner, U. S. N., and Henry F. Reich, U. S. N. In the execution of hydrography south of Cape Canaveral, triangulation points and descriptions of stations were furnished by Subassistant W. I. Vinal, who was there engaged in a survey of the lower portion of Indian River.

Hyilrography off Egrnont Key and off Light-House Point.-Liaut. E. B. Thomas, U.S. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, was assigned in December to work on the west and east coasts of Florida. At tlie conclusion of work on the coast of Maine the steamer Bache had been laid up at Baltimore for repairs. These being finally completed, and other necessary preliminary arrangements made, the hydrographic party sailed from Baltimore on December 22, reaching Norfolk on the 27th. rhere the vessel was delayed until January 15, ta,king additional supplies. Tampa Bay was reached on February 3, and work was immediately commenced upon a projection off and to the 11orthward of Egmont Key Light. OD its completion another projection south of Egmont Key Liglit was taken up and finiRhfld, after which the vessel was transferred to work on a third sheet off Light-House Point. This work was completed on April 3, and the vessel then sailed for Key West. The party was subsequently engaged upon hydrography on the east coast of Florida, noticed in a preceding abstract. That abstract contains also a summary of the statistics for the season's operations. Progress was somewhat retarded by the unusual severity of the weather. The officers attached to the vessel were Lieut. J. A.H. Nickels, U. S. N., and Masters Charles J. Badger, Frank A. Wilner, and Henry F. Reich, U. S. N., all of whom manifested an active interest in the advancement of the work.

Mississippi River suri1ey.-As mentioned in the last annual report, the survey of the Mississippi Ri't'"er in connection with the work of tbe Mississippi Hiver Commission had, at the close of the fiscal year 1880, made good progress. At that date the triangulation of the river was completed between the Gulf and Helena, Ark., with the exception of portions between Bayou Sara and Baton Rouge, La., betwet>n Providence, La., and Greem·ille, Miss., and between Vicksburg, Miss., and Providence, La. The topography had :tlso been advanced in iseveral localities. During the fiscal ~rear ending June 30, 1881, the gaps in the triangulation were closed, with the exception of tllat portion betw·een Greenville, Miss., and Helena, .A.rk., the completion of which work will give a connected system of triangulation between tlie Gulf and Memphis, Tenn.; an azimuth was measured at the base line near Greenville, Miss., and that hase connected with the triangulation; the hydrograpby was extended from a point four miles below Donaldsonville, La., to Plaquemine, La., and the lines of geodetic leveling were completed between Carrollton, La., and Greenville, Miss. The great accurac,y attained in the last-mentioned work is worthy of remark. In a distance of four hundred and fifty miles the results of two distinct lines accord within a limit of error of little more than one inch. Basing conclusions on these results it is probable that the average limit of error of a determination ·by the same methods of the relative levels of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans will fall within two and one-half inches. The following res1ime of the leveling operations on the Mississippi River is furnished by Mr. C. A. Schott, Assistant in charge of the Computing Division. The whole operation was divided and executed in four parts, viz: Part 1. From Greenville, Miss., to Milliken's Bend, La., .Assistant Tittmann and Mr. Weir, January to May, 1880. Part 2. From Milliken's Bend, La., to opposite Rodney, Miss., Mr. Weir, November, 1880, to

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

The connectiou of tbe ahoYe line of le>efa with the mean Gnlf le-rel remains to be made. Tidal ob.~ervation.~.-A self-registering gauge was made by Fauth & Co., of Washington, under the snperYision of the Chief of tl1e Tidal Division a,rnl after his plans, and Rent to General :n. M. Ilarr0<l, State Engineer of Lonishma :mrl mem her of the MississipJ)i River Commission, by whose or1lPr it wa8 made a111l for whom it is being mm<l at J,ake Borgne, Louisimrn, where au Pxtended series is contemplate1l to gin~ a reference plane f'or tlie 8m·,·ey of flip river. H!Jill'OlJraplty.-The hydrograpl1y of the Mississippi Hiwr, ewcutell h~- Lieut. Uriel Sebree, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coa8t. and Gt>o(ktic Snn·py, with the steamer Gedney, extt~nrls from a point fonr miles below Donaldr;onville, La., to within two miles of Plrrquemin<'. Work was commenced in Uecemlier on a pr~ject.iou, 11calt' ~ 1;\,- 1,, extending from the point just mentioned, four miles below Do11aldsom-ill1' to Donaklr;onville. At a wlrnrfat this plnce a tide-gange was established and connected hy a lilie of Im-els with thr bench-mark No. XVJ I of Assistant Andrew Braid, which i8 on the left hank of the riYrr, oue mile ahoYe llonal<lso11\ille. To tl1is th!' soundingH will be referred. From information recf~h-ecl at tl1e. locality, Lieutenant Sebree reports tliat. the zero of thiR wliarfgange iR prohabl,\- at ahont tlle low-water mark of the river for that year. But this is uncertain. 'fhr general plan pursued in tlle execution of this work was to run sections normal to the 1 i Yer at a 11ista11ce of a half mile apart. At each section four lines were run, two running in one direction a111l two in the other. Tlle lines in the sections are fifty meters apart. On these liner;, which were nm in tlie large steam launch No. 3, it was found necmisar.v to fix the po11ition of the sounding» hy frt>qnent. angle11 from tl1e shore. '.Vhere the current wa11 ('Omparatively constant and t.he <lcpt.h uot too great, angles were taken only at ernry spcond or thir<l sounding. The time for each angular ohserrntion was i11dicated h.r the dropping of a hall on tltP launch. In deep water it was fonrnl 1wcrssmT to stop the boa.t at cacl1 sonlJ(ling. A i<'all weighing from ten to tweh-e pounds was nsP1l, witli a 8Hia JI line, aml the lattPr frcqncntly compared each day so as to clet.ect any cliange of leng·th. On each rm1ge, tl11~ distance from tltc water's l'tlge to the top of the lewl was chainP1l. Sonw of tlw lines of som1dings w<·re rn11 twice, and ad1litio11al somulings "Were made where needed, tlw positi011s heinl-( plotted by a11gles taken from the boat. \York wa8 closed on the 11th of April, hiwing then cxternh-11 to within two miles of Plaqneminr. Tlw V<'Nsd \ms thf'n transferred to work Oil the eo:uit of Texas, which will be noticed under tlw head of Section IX. The ofikers attached to tlw GP<l11Py WPre Lieut. K :H.

He arri\·ed at New Orlea118 on October 23, fitted the scl10oner Research for the work, and arrivecl at Bayou Sara, La., on Novemher 1. IIere the triangulation was commenced, connecting "·ith the Rtations Depot, S. E. base, and Alexander Creek, occupied hy Assistant Dennis <luring the preceding sPaHon. As the work was extended southward nmc~h ilea>~· cntting was fonnd necessary, a111l reconnaissance was difficult. Severe storms and nnusnal cold prevailed during the wiuter and rctar<lecl progress. An eight-inch micrometer mieroscope dirt>ction instrument made by Fauth & Co., was nsed in this work, aud was found well suited for the class of observations required. Five positions were generally taken, aml the observations when po88ihle wne made at oue setting of the in11trument. On the hlutl:-1 at Port Hudson the station Slaughter was securely marked and referred to a stone monument carried hack from the hank in order to 11ecure a. permanent mark on the bluffs. 'Vhere practicable the stations of Assistrtnt Granger',; work were included in the scheme. Mr. Van Or1len's field computation of the length of the B:tton Rouge base from Bayou Sara hase, as determined by triangnlation, agrees with the measurement of Assistant Ogden within .055rn, a !latisfactory result considering t.be nature of tlie scheme.

The first work necessary preiiminary to takiug UJ> the regular triangulation of the river was the selection of a ba.se-site and me;1suremeut of a base-line nea.r Hreem·ille, :'.\Iiss. After the site was selected and cleared heav,y rains retarded the measurement. During Uiese nufaYorable intervals the triangulation was laid out and executed, connecting the base with tlte astronomical station made by Assistant Ed wiu Smith in 1878, and thence extended some eiglit miles down the river. On the 24th of December the vessel was moved to Ohl Greenville landing, where a small observatory and brick pier were built over the south llase for azimuth observations.

In April, 1881, Assistant Davidson commeuce11 operations preliminar.r to the measurement of the Yolo base-line. Assistant Colonua visited the. locality of tlH· base, and attende(J t.o tltt· grading of the line aud the building of uecessar>· bridges aud supports. The other members of the party were engaged up to Jnne 30 in rnhicellaneom; work haying reference to the base measun~meut and the transcontinental triangulation. The expedition sent to Point Barrow, iu the Arctic Ocean, by the United States Go,·ernment, for the purpose of making a continuous series of meteorological, tidal, magnelic, pendulum, and other obscr,·ations at that point, saikd lhm1 San Francii<eo towards the latter part of June under co111rnan<l of Liente11a11t. Hay. The ohsetTers iu Sm Franciisco who aecompa11ied the expedition were carefolly drilled by Assistant Daddson in magnetic aud azimuth obsen·ations and the manner of recording tides. Obsenatories for the use of the party were cousti'uctetl under bis supervision, and all practicable assistance rendered with a Yiew of furthering the objects of the expedition. Triangulation and topography.-·with a view to the completion of the triangulation and topog· raphy of the coast of California between W alalla Ui ver and Point Arena, in Mendocino County, Assistant Sengteller commenced to organize a part.}· on J u}y 1, Mr. Fremont Morse. being assig·ned as Aid. Arrangements being finally completed, the part.}· t-0ok the field on Jul;r 13; work was begun on the 15th of that month and steadily prosecuted until the close of the season. While the development of the topography was in progress in the early part of the seasou favorable opportunities were taken to complete the triangulation left unfinished at the close of the preceding season. Four stations were occupied, and a complete closure efiected agreeing satisfac· torily with previous results. The topographical work for the completion of the sheet in the immediate vicinity of the Walalla River was first taken up. Upon this sheet is included Robinson's Landing, a wire cable chute, situated near the mouth of the Walalla Ri\Ter, and entirely exposed to all winds and swells. Here, during the season, a schooner broke f1·om her moorings and was completely wrecked on the beach at the south shore of the Walalla River. The next sheet taken up extends from Haven's Neck to Junction triangulation station, the latter point being the southern limit of the survey of 1870. This sheet includes three landings, Saunders', Iverson's, and Steen's, and the remains of three others, now abandoned. These landings are exposed to all winds a.nd swells, and are dangerous of approach except under the most favorable circumstances. About one-half mile westerly of Sauntlerll' Landing a group of rocks, visible only at low water, spring tides, was discovered and determined, and kelp patches, so far as they could be iden-

tified, were also located, ranging from one· half to three-fourths mile off shore, and having probabJy not more than four fathoms of water under them. The general character of the topography is similar to the work of tbe two preceding sea.sons, the shore-lines consisting of precipitous bluffs, backed by a rapidly-rising timbered country. The weather during the season was exceptionalJy favorable for field-work, being clear and calm. Occasionally the smoke caused by forest fires rendered the work of triangulation impracticable, but this did not retard the topography. Assistant Sengt~ller mentions in his season's report the existence of several dangers to navigation north of Russian River, and recommends that they be suitably marked. Upon the recommendation of Lieut. Col. A. S. Williamson, United States Engineers, Mr. Sengteller was visited by Messrs. G. W. Call and Aaron Schroyer, of Fort Ross, Cal., to confer in reference t;o the site for a proposed light-house between Point Reyes and Point Arena. For ~his purpose Assistant Sengteller recommends Salt Point, about six miles to the northward of Fort Ross and distant from Point Reyes and Point Arena thirty-six and thirty-one miles, respectively, being the most commanding point from the northward or southward by reason of its projection seaward. Before leaving Point Arena, the positions of the new constructions erected at that point since 1870, consisting of a fog-whistle building, tanks, and windmill, were uetermined on the t;opographical sheet of that locality, and the shore-line in the immediate vicinity of the light-house was retraced. The results show that the bluff on the south side of the dwelling-house and the" hlowhole" iu front of the light near the fog. whistle building are gradually washing away. Mr. Fremont Morse was attached to the party during the season, and rendered acceptable service.

Tidal observatwns.-At the request of Mr. W. D. Alexander, superintendent of the survey of the Sandwich Islands, a self-registering tide-gauge was loaned to him for the purpose of securing a series of tidal observations at Honolufu. These observations were commenced in June, 1877, and he has been kept supplied with record paper and blank forms for continuing the series. The results have been transmitted occasionally t-0 the United States Coast Survey Office, and already form a valuable set of records, comparable with those made on the Pacific coast of the United States, Such an opportunity for extending the investigation of the tides of the Pacific Ocean has long been sought by the officers of the Coast Survey.

Topograpky, triangu.latu,;,,, and kydrography of the Oolumbia River.-Owing to the nooessity of repair to the barge Kincheloe, Assistant Cleveland Rockwell was unable to resume the survey of the Columbia River nntil the 5th of Augnst. At that date the river was still high, the bottom lands being flooded to a depth of three or four feet, and the triangulation points on low ground had all been swept away. These conditions rendering hydrographic work impracticable, Assistant Rockwell necessarily confined his operations t;o the t;opograpby, for which triangulation points were available upon the high ground near Columbia City and Saint Helen's. Work was commenced at Columbia City and Bteadily prosecuted until the close of the season in November, when the shoot ext.ending from that place to a point several miles above Sa.int Helen's was oomplet.ed.

The sheet traverses the river so as to include the channels of Lewis River, Lake River, Willamette Slough, and Scapoosa Bay, and extends to the high lands on both sides of the basin of the Columbia. The character of the country embraced in the limits of this sheet is somewhat different from that lower down the river, particularly in the vicinity of Saint Helen's, back of which village is a large area of basaltic table-land, nearly fl.at on its general surface, but much cut up by abrupt gorges and l\,Wamp-holes in the solid rock. The surface of this rocky plateau elevated from sixty to one hundred feet above the river is nearly.denuded of soil and covered with moss and short grasses, with groves of scrub oak and fir around the ponds and through the swales. On the oppo. site side of the Columbia, between Lewis and Lake Rivers, are two or three square miles of very low country, consisting principally of mud fiats, through which project great numbers of rocky islands of many sizes and curious shapes. During the season Assistant Rockwell furnished to Lieut. Col. G. L. Gillespie, of the Corps of Engineers, in charge of the river improvements, such data as his party required in making detailed surveys and examinations at various points along the river. The statistics of the season's work are given below: Shore line of river, miles . - - . . . . . . . · . . . ... _- - . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . 56 Shore line of ponds and sloughs, miles . . . . . . . . . · . . . · . . . . . . . . . . · · · · · · . . . . . · . . 40 Roads, miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . · . 139i Area of topography, square miles........................................... 21 Towards the end of April Assistant Rockwell resumed field-work, and during the early part of the season was engaged in erecting .and determining signals for the hydrography. This work was much retarded by unfavomble weather and the necessity for heavy cutting to open lines of sight. During May six days only were available for sounding, owing to continued bad weather. These unfavorable intervals were spent in taking sextant angles and erecting signals. A temporary tirle-gauge was erected and observations recorded. In June the triangulation was taken up and six stations were observed upon from Scapoosa Station. The signals destroyed during the previous season wer<l re-erected, and the reconnaissance extended for further work. Soundings were executed on three days. The work done lies between Columbia City and a point one mile above Kalama. Special topograpky of the Columbia River.-Assistant E. Hergesheimer has continued field and office work for the t-0pographica,l manual, gi\·ing special attention during the first part of the year to the forms of eroded eruptive rocks, as shown in the basin of the Columbia River, making for that purpose a detailed topographical survey of the narrow portion of the Dalles where many of the prevailing type forms are comprised within a comparatively small area. During the season, when the weather at the Dalles was unfavorable for work, Mr. Hergesheimer made a series of views for Coast Pilot use and for the first four maps of the Columbia River.<". He also made a trip of observation of the topography of the Columbia River Basin as far as Walla Walla, of which he has made a detailed report. His report appears in full in .Appendix No. 7 of this report. Returning to Cali· fornia from Oregon, by the overland route, and thence to Washington, D. O., Mr. Hergesheimer inked his survey of the Dalles and views at the mouth of the Columbia River and continued the drawing of sample topography for the topographical manual and the preparation of a new edition of the "Treatise on the plane-table," besides such miscellaneous t-0pographical work as the assistant in charge of the office from time to time required of him. 'I'riatngulation afl,i/, topography.-The triangulation and topography of Port Orchard and adjacent inlets and passe.ges of Puget Sound was continued by Assistant Eugene Ellicott from June 17, 1880, to November 30. It was again resumed early in June, 1881, and was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. The triangulation of Port Orchard, including Dye's Inlet, Ostrich Bay, and Dogfish Bay, was executed in October and November, 1880. It extends from the south end of Port Orchard northward to a junction at the south end of Admiralty Inlet, with the triangulation executed in 1856. The topography includes portions of Case's Inlet, Hammersley's Inlet, and Eld Inlet, executed

N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Sun·ey, inch1ded soundings in Lower Hood's Canal and the entrance to Hood's Canal and the survey of Oak Bay, Kilisut Harbor, Port Discovery, and Washington Harbor. The schooner Earnest and a steam launch afforded the necessary transportation. ·work in the localities mentioned was commenced in July and steadily prosecuted to the end of the following January, when work was suspended, owing to the necessity for repairs to the steam launch. Operations were again resumed iu May aud continued until the close of the year. At the end of June all of the work as before mentioned was completed, with the exception of the sheet including Port. Discovery and Washington Harbor, which was then well under way. Ensigns S. T. Brown and Henr.r T.

Recnnnaissance.-The reconnaissance for a primary base.line site on the shore of Boundary Bay, in British Oolumbill, was executed by Assistant Stellman Forney during the months of AnguRt,Septem ber, and part of October, 1880. · The schooner FH tmtleroy was used for the transportation of the party. Previous to sending a party to that locality it was deemed proper to obtain tbe consent of the Canadian Gol'ernment for making the necessary examinations, erecting signals, and executing other work of the survey on that territory. Application was made accordingly to the proper authorities, and the desired permission was courteously granted, on the condition that in case of consequent damage to private ~roperty the owners should be duly reimbiused by the Survey. On October 15, Assistant Forney was recalled, the necessary funds not being available for a further prosecution of the work, and directed to return to Olympia and thence t.o San Francisco. At Olympia be remained for a sufficient time to attend to the sale of the schooner Fauntleroy, that vessel being found unfit for further use on the Survey. He arrived at San Francisco in December. Mr. P. A. 'Velker, aid, was attached to the party during the season and rendered efficient a.ssistance in the work. As the result of his examination Assistant Forney names three sites as available for a base· line. These are all on the northern shore of Boundary Bay, and within a few miles of each other. The first and most northerly site proposed is over a corduroy road, covered with six: inches of gravel, running from Ladner's Landing, on the Frazer River, to New Westminster, B. 0. Here a straight line of six and one-half' miles can be obtained, but the ground is unstable, and the disturbance is considerable, caust>.d by passing teams. The second site mentioned extends along the delta near the shore of Boundary Bay. A site of five and a half miles cau here be obtained, running over ground the surface of which consists of a layer of peat eight inches deep, underlaid by tough clay. The ground here is also reported as heing very springy and unstable. The third site examined by Mr. Forney is situated about three miles sonth from the second and

parallel to it, on the beach near the high-water mark of Boundary Bay. Here a line five and a half miles in length can be measured over a hard sand beach. The measurement of this line would, however, have to be made between the tides, which would never allow more than six or eight hours work on each day. Assistant "Forney reports that the rain;y season in this locality usually sets in about the middle of October; that after that time work would be retarded by rain and storms, and that southeast gales have been known to back the tides up to within a mile of the corduroy road proposed as the first base site. This woulcl of course floocl the other two sites proposed. The whole delta from Fraser River to Boundary Bay is a peat bog, which cluring the winter is covered with water, and remains so covered until the rains subside. The honse>s of the settlers are built upon piles four or five feet above the ground, and the snrronnding land is well dyked. Preparittions were in pro. gress to run ditches over the whole delta so as to secure drainage. S E C T I 0 N XII.

Tidal observations.-The self-registering tide-gauge taken out to Kadiak, an island on tbe coast of Alaska, by Mr. W. H. Dall, was put up there at Saint Paul, ou a wharf of the Alaska Commercial Company, and has been run coutinnom;ly by Mr. "\V. T. Fisher. It was started in .A.ngust, 1880, and the curves and tabulated results for ten months~ which have been receiYed, are satisfactor.v in appearance. Coast of Alaslca.-Data for the Coast Pilot and for enlarging our knowledge of the variation of the compass, and other magnetic elements iu Alaska, heing greatly needed, Assistant Dall was directed to proceed to San Francisco, and t11e11ce to Alaska, the schooner Yukon being assigned to him for this work. At the request of the United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries, Prof. Spencer F. Baird, an attache of the Fish Commission, Dr. T. H. Bean, was permitted to accompany the party on the Yukon, for the purpose of collecting information in regard to the fisheries and material for the United States Census Office. The party was divided at first. Mr. Marcus Baker proceeded to Sitka on the May steamer, collecting information and making magnetic obsen-ations on the way at different stopping places, for which unusual facilities were kinc'lly fnrniio:he<l b~' Mr. P. B. Cornwall, agent of the steamer, Capt. James Carroll, commandiug, itud Pilot "William E. George. On arrh·ing at Sitka, Mr. Baker found that a party was about to be dispatched by Capt. L.A. Beardsley, U. S. N., commanding the U.S. S. Jamestown, stationed at Sitka, to the Ohilcat River (latitude 590 15' north, longitude 13."i0 30'). Mi;. Baker was invited to avail" himself of the opportunity of enlarging the field of. observation by accompanying this party, and accepted. He left Sitka ]\fay 20, and returned there on the 5th of June. During this journey in an open row-boat, which was attended with much discomfort from the inclemency of the weather and other causes incidental to such a trip, eight stations were >isited and much information gained in alldition to that already acquired on the steamer voyage from Portland to Sitka. The schooner Y nkon was dispatched from San Francisco direct to Sitka on the 13th of May by Assistant Dall, who then followed Mr. Baker on the Jtme steamer for Sitka, collecting informittion for the Coast Pilot, the entire party coming together again at Sitka on the arrival of the steamer, June 7, 1880. After rating chronometers, &c., thP. party sailed from Sitka .Tune 16 for Port Althorp, Cross Sound, where observations for position were obtained, showing the charts to be in error to the extent of some ten miles in longitude of that station. From Port Althorp the Yukon successively proceeded to Port Mulgrave; Cook's Inlet (three stations visited); Saint Paul, Kadiak Island; N. W. Harbor, Shnmagin Islands; Humboldt Harbor, Slmmagin; Dolgoi Island; Belkoffsky; Lisy ·Island; Unalashka; Saint Paul Island, Pribiloff group; and Plover Bay, Eastern Siberia, where chronometers were rated and magnetic observations made. The Yukon then proceeded through Bering Strait into the Arctic Ocean, stations being selected at Ca.pe Lisburue, Icy Cape, nnd at. Port Belcher. At this last station the pack-ice was met, preventing the party from reaching Point Barrow as had been intended, and the Yukon was directed southward, t-0nching at Kotzebue Sound

and obtaining observations off Cape Krusenstern. These observations on the Arctic coast were very important, showing a large discrepancy between the magnetic variation actually observed and that recorded on the latest charts of this region. On the 5th of September a hydrothermal section of Bering Strait was successfully accomplished. On the completion of it shelter was sought from a gale in Port Clarence, where a station was occupied. On the 10th of September a station was successfull,y occupied on one of the Diomede Islands, Bering Strait, thus determining the longitude of the meridian separating the .American possessions from those of Russia. Plover Bay was then revisited, and the Yukon proceeded to Saint Lawrence Island, where bad weather prevented a landing being made; to Saint Matthew, where observations were secured in the face of great difficulties. From this time the weather became excessively stormy, and after two weeks of incessant gales, being blown away from the entrance t-0 Unalashka Harbor and narrowly escaping shipwreck, the Yukon finally obtained shelter in Uhernoffsky Harbor: U nalashka, d~ring a gale which depressed the barometer to 28.25 (tM lowest ever recorded in this region) and kept it below 29 inches for several days. Observations of importance were secured at Chernoffsky placing that port some twenty minutes of longitude west of its position on the charts. Unalashka Harbor was reached October 6, and the Yukon sailed for San Francisco October 18, and reached San Francisco November 6, after a stormy and tedious passage. During the season the party traveled some 12,000 miles and occupied forty-two stations, at which sixteen thousand observations of different kinds were made, and sufficient materials for a magnetic cliart of the .Alaskan region were obtained. SEOTION XIII.
KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE.

Astronomical.-As mentioned under the head of Section II, Mr. Edwin Smith, before taking the fielll for telegraphic longitude work, proceeded to Greenville, Miss., to determine the azimuth of the base measured near that place by .Assistant C.H. Boyd. After the completion of that work, Mr. Smith went to Louisville, Ky., and determined the azimuth of the base measured during the preceding season by .Assistant G . .A. Fairfield. When this work was finished, Mr. Smith returned to WaRhington, D. C., to arrange for the operations of the coming season. He was assisted at Greenville and I,ouisville by Mr. Carlisle Terry, jr., Ai<l. Reconnai.vsance in Kentucky.-Field operations in Kentucky were resumed early in July. Mr. C. Schenk in charge, devoted the season principally to a thorough examination of the country lying between the measured base nea.r Louisville and Salt River, for the purpose of determining the most economical plan to reach the line Riley-Mountain Top, which was the indispensable geodetic base for the Kentucky scheme heretofore laid out. .After the erection of high tripods at Williams and Prospect Stations, and the exhaustion of all the methods known in reconnaissance to test the intervisibility of points, it was finally ascertained that the line connecting the two stations was impracticable. Under these circumstances, Mr. Schenk examined in detail the escarpment on the Indiana side of the river, and finally succeeded in finding an intermediate station which would complete the quadrilaterals terminating on the desired base. .After the settlement of this question, the different stations were marked and described; tripod signals were erected at two of the stations, and a recounaisance was made to Jeptha. Field-work was suspended toward the close of November. Mr. Schenk was confined to his room by sickness for about a month in the middle of the season. Triangulation in Tennessee.-In the last .Annual Report it was stated that at the close of June Professor Buchanan was making observations from the capitol building at Nashville, for the purpose of connecting the astronomical station in the University grounds with the scheme for the Tenne!<see triangulation. During the season commencing July 1, Professor Buchanan completed the series of observations referred to above; occupied< and finished three other stations, Bennett, Short Mountain, and Hall; and re-oecupied Jennings to obtain the dirootion to Bennett, and to a new station designated Apple. About the middle of the sea.son he erected two additional tripod signals, one at Apple, and the other at Mount Lore. The quadrilat.era.ls so far formed are of excel-

OHIO, INDIANA, ILLINOIS, MICHIGAN, AND WISCONSIN.

Triangulation in Ohio.-Prof. R. S. DeYol resumed the reconnaissance for t11e extem;ion of the triangulation.in Ohio on July 1, and closed the field-work 011 September 4. On the Uth he returned to his duties as professor of mathematics in the university at Athens. It was intended to have continued tlw scheme northwardly from Columbus, but the flat and heavily-timbered lands of Franklin, Delaware, anu Morrow Cou11ties remlered this direction impracticable, except at very great expense. Hence, takiug- ad nwtage of the hills reg-ion 11ear the western sources of the Muskingum River, Professor Devol started from a liue established during the preceding season in Licking County, about twenty-fiye miles east of Columbus, and from that base worked northwardly, laying out a scheme as far as the southern boundary of Huron County. Here, again, the knobs and other eleYations ceased; and after a thorough examination of the intervening thirty miles to Lake Erie, he was forced to the conclusion that a connection with th1~ lake could be made only by the employment of nnusunlly high tripod8 and scaffolds. It should be added, however, that. in his belief the triangulation may be continued east or west. from the present. termination of the seheme in R.ichland County. The net-work of proposed geodetic points laid out this season consh;ts of twelrn stations, forming six quadrilaterals, with sides varying in length from seYen to twenty-one miles. Astrorwmical.-In the spring of 1881, Assistflut G. W. Dean, with Mr. F. H. Parsons as Aid, was occupied in visiting and erecting astronomical obseITatories a.t severa.l points, preparatory to continuing the regular determinations for telegraphic longitudes. Near Cincinnati, Ohio, a site for the observatory was selected at a locality about seven miles from the city, and in 'the vicinity of Mount Lookout. Before leaving Cincinnati arrangements were well advanced for the favorable prosecution of the longitude work. These operations were greatly aided by the facilities a:fforded by the V\Testern Union Telegraph Company, who furnished labor and material for the connection by telegraph of the new observatory with the main lines of wires running into Cincinnati. · Magnetw observations.-In carrying out the regular scheme of magnetic observations in Section XIV, SubMsistant J. B. Baylor determined the three magnetic elements and the approximate geographical position of his stations at the following places: In Ohio, at Cincinnati, Athens~ and Cleveland; in Michigan, at Grand Haven, Mackinac, Sanlt Ste. Marie, and Ontonagon; in Wisconsin, at Superior Oi1!.1; in Indiana, at New Harmony, Indianapolis, Richmond, and Vincennes. Triangulation in Indiana~-The reconnaissance for the triangulation of Indiana was resumed by Prof. J. L. Campbell early in July, and continued until October 20. Starting from the line McCarlin-Irvington, in the vicinity of Indianapolis, the country to the northward as far as the boundary of Michigan, a distance of one hmulred aud twent;r-six miles, was carefully examined, and a preliminary net-work of triangles laid out, terminating on a proposed site for a base of verification, near the northern boundary of the State. The scheme consiRts of twelve quadrilaterals and one heptagon, with sides varying in length from six and one-half to nineteen and Oll0-half miles. On that part of the above route lying between Castleton and the

48

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

Wabash River a second series of quadrilaterals, eight in number, was located further to the eastward and along the line of the Indianapolis, Peru and Chicago Rail way; and this special series is preferred by Professor Campbell, on account of the facilities for transportation. The country over which the reconnaissance extended was found to be generally level, there being no dislocations of strata by upheavals, aud consequently no elevations except such as are produced by tile action of surface water. Moreover the laud is covered with a forest of high trees. The selection of points was made chiefly by careful barometric observations for differences of heights, in connection with a study of the water-courses. The only method to be adopted in a section of country of the character described is the erection of high signals and observing tripods: the average height of which, according to Professor Campbell, must be about one hundred feet. 'Triangulation and reconnaissance in Illinois.-At the outset of the fiscal year the c-0ntinuation of the primar.v triangulation eastward along the Thirty-ninth Parallel in Illinois was intrusted to Assistant G. A. Fairfield. It. was arranged that the reconnaissance should at the same time be continued to the eastward b~· Assistant F. W. Perkins, from the terminal points of the scheme previously adopted. The prelimirnuy arrangements having been made in June, field-work was well under way by the 1st of July, The whole of t,hat month and a port.ion of August were spent in the erection of the necessary tripod sigmtls. The actual work of observing was commenced 011 Augtmt 13, at tl1e station Clarke's Mound. After tlii:-; the stations Sugar Loaf and Turkey Hill were occupied. On October 21, Mr. Isaac ·wiustou, Aid, who had rendered efficient service in the party, wa:-; detached and ordered t<? duty i11 tlte leYeliug part.y of .A.ssistant Andrew "Braid 011 the l\Iississippi Uiver, and at the same time Aissi:staut l'erkius was ordered to close his reconuai:ssance antl to joiu the part~' of Assistant .Fairfield for the continuance of the triangulation. Obserrntions at Turkey Hill were completed ou November 6. Observations at Dre.rer, the next ;;tatio11 occupied, were delayed b,Ynnfavorableweathcr, and were uot closed until the 6th of December, when operations were suspended for the seasou. 'l'be weather during the early part of the work was generally favorable, but during the months of October and November observations were much retardetl b,Y nnfaYorable condHious of the atmosphere. On October la a Yery severe gale of wind, accompanied by rain, set in and continued for nearly three dayis. lu this gale the tripod arnl scaffold sigual at Geoffry and tlie lofty gas.pipe pole at Parkinson signal were blown down. O!Jservations of double zenith distances were made throughout the season upon as many signals as practicable.

Perkins between July 11 and August 11, and between A ngnst 27 and October 24, was successfully carried from the points Hoile and Geoffry to the Wabash Hiver, including about one thousand eight hundred square miles of country. The topography of tl1e State 01 Illinois along the Thirty-nh1tb Parallel is very uniform. Betweeu the bluffs east of the Great American Bottom and the Kaskaskia R.iverthe surface is 81ightly rolliug, but east of the Kaskaskia it is nearly level, except where the streams in their souther!~' course have swept away the li.;ht soil, leaving wide flat \'alleys or bottom lands. l'revious to commencing the recon11aissance, Assistant Perkins collected all available information in regard to heights, &c., throughout this region. The best maps of the country were then ohtaiued, and upon them the watershells were approximately laid down. Trial figures were then laid out, the points to be occupied resting upon the dividing ridges and the centers of the longer lines made to foll in the river and creek bottoms. The highest land near each of these trial points was then found, it.s approximate height above the sea level determined, and an examination made of the country lying between .any two of these trial points. From the data thus obtained, the

Primary triangulation.-At the commencement of the fi8cal year, Snbassistaut· B. 1Y. Blair was in the field engaged in the extension west.ward of the primary triangulation in Missouri. Tt11~ station first occupied was High Poi11t. On the 10th of Jnly Assistant F. D. Granger joined the 1mrty. Ile co-operated in the work until obscrYat.ions at that station were completed on July 18, when he assumed charge of the part.J·, l\lr. Blair being transferred to office duty in Washington. In addition to High Point, six other st.ations were occupil·d during the season, namely, Hunter, North Base, Hughes, Heard, Cole, and Hubbard, in the order given. The first, Hunter, was also occupied astronomically. At this station seven primary and two secondary objects were observed upon. For latitude twenty-three pairs of st.rirs were observed upon five nights. Azimuth was also observed and referred to North Base. On August 14 the camp was moved to North Base, and observations were begun August rn upon seven primary signals. ·work at this t-itation was closed ou August 31, wheu the party was transferred to Hughes, a few miles west of Versailles, Morgan County. The signal at Hughes being over one hundred feet in height and built of t.wo-incb planking·, its occupation was attended by considerable difficulty. These were, however, m·ercome hy the use of guys ancl canvas screens for the protection of the tripod. Pine weather facilitatecl the work of observing, and the field computation gives good results for the work at this station. On account of the height of the signal at Hughes and its exposure to injury, it was tleemecl advisable to close all observations on that st.a.tion before occupying the stations Hubbard and Cole.

Assistant I~dward Goodfellow render1id aid thmuglwut, the year in execntin1 duty, awl in the preparation for publication of the annual reports. Iu order t-0 meet the iucreased dcurnrnl for nrnps and <~harts, it hccame necm;sary to e11largc the printing office hy the building of an a.nucx, awl the establishment of a 11cw press of large sizt'; tliiR work was completetl aud the uew im~ss iu operation early in Decemlwr. '£he adaptation of a room iu the uort,heast part of the basement of the office for comparison;; of base-bars was completed according to the plans of Assistant Schott. In this room were huilt up from the ground the brick piers aud supporto; for the meter h:ns, standards, and comparators; a new floor was laid, isolated from the piers; sudden changes of temperature were guarded against hJ· double sashes to the windows; uniformity in the fomperatures of cornpariso11 w:ts maintained by immersing the bars in a tank filled with glycerine, and connected with a heating aud cooling ap1)ara~us. The tank wa.s armngetl to be moved easily and rapidly upon frames or carriages running over iron rails. These facilities were made available for the comparisons for the deteJ.'.miuatiou of length of the new five-meter primary base apparatus, the construction of which, as designed by Assistant Schott,

was completed in June, 1881. A full account of these comparisons with descriptiom;of the metl10ds and apparatus employed has been deposited in the archi,·es. The work aClmmplished ma,y be summarized as follows: 1. The construction of five steel meters with plat,inum-iridium contad end15, and the comparisons of each of these meters with the stamlanl meter of the survey-the committee meter of 1799. 2. The determination of the coefticient of expam;iou of each meter. ;~. The comparison of the two five-meter ,8tandard steel bars with the joint length of the five melers. !. The determination of the coefficient of expansion of the two five-meter stawhtrds. 5. The comparison of the bars of the five-meter base apparatus. G. Determiuation of the constants of the Bessel-Hepsol<l comparators (Nos. I and II), and of the Fauth & Co. screw level comparators (Nos. III and IV) and observations for scale values, and determination of the corrections of the thermometers used in the comparisons. It may be J1ere stated that a comparison will be made between the six-meter iron standard, nr)on which depend the primary base lines heretofore measured, and the joint length of one of the new five-meter standards and one of the single meters. These operations lmYing been completed, on the 25th of ,June the new base apparatus, after in8pectiou by the Superintendent, was packed for transportation to California, where its practical working qualities will be tested in the measurement of the Yolo Base. ImproYemcnts already matle, aud others pn~jeeted in the eircular graduating engine, demanded incrcase«l Rpace and a more steady water power f'C)r tlwir 1wo11er iqiplication; l1ence a room of larger size a1l,ioining the comparing roolll was carPfully prepared for it, and the 8Upply of water maiutainetl by a resen·oir upon the floor abm·e. The e11gi11e was mounted iu lfoorn No. 7 npou a fouudaLion of a snbstantfal character s1iecially lmilt for it Its automatic part was arranged 80 that as soon a8 the la8t line of any graduation was cut tlw water wai-; slmt oil' and t11e motion stopped. In order to secure a uniform temperature of HS0 I·'., which is Uw temperature of gm1luatiou, an automatic heat rngulator was devis<·«l to limit the amount of gas to be burned for heati11g purpose8. .Much time was also give11 to the consideration of the b<·Ht method of ohtai11i11i::- au automatic arrangement for the correction of the errors of gradnatiou. The ceuteriug-apparatus wa>: greatly simplified, and its working is uow entirely satisfactor~·. The plaus for these improvemonts were d1wised by Mr. Saegmuller, chief mechauician, in consultation with myself, aud for their successful execution much credit is due to him. Mr. Saegmuller's "solar attachment" to the ordinary surveyor'8 tran8it deserves mention here. It consists of a second tele8cope mounted upon aa axis perpendicular to the main telescope and provided with a level by which the parallelism of the two tele8copel'! may be readily determined. The 8maller tele8copc having been set so that the angle between the two is e'Iual to the declination of the sun for the time of observation, the tra1115if tcle1mopc cau then be set to the latitude of the place, and by turning the two telescopes iudcpendent.ly of each other on their res1rnctive axes the snu can be brought into the field of view of the small telescope, irnd the larger telescope will then be in the 11lane of the meridiau. vVheu these successive. adjustments have been carefully made the true azimuth of the sun eau be determined within one minute of arc, a degree of accumcy much gTeater than can h@ reached witlt the orditrnry solar compass. During the ytiar I availed myself of the aid of S(Weral field officers, temporarily assigned to office duty, for the prosecution of iuvcstigrttions relating to the operations of the survey. Assistant G. A. };'airfield, upon reporting at t.l1e office about Um middle of' March, began the collection of material available for the prosecutiou of his field-work during the coming season, and familiarized himself with the practica,1 working of the instruments to be naed. Towards the end of April he was detached to take charge of a primary triangulation party. As8ista.nt E. Hergesheimer reported for office duty in May, and was directed. to take up the preparation of a "treatise on the plane table." He studied, in relation to this, the best mode of dividing telemeter rods, making a st~riC8 of comparisons of the results of telemeter and micrometer distance measures. Towards the eml of J nne he was assigned to the charge of the office division of topography upon its prospective organization during the early part of the ensuing month. Assistant S. 0. McOorkle, upon his assignment t;o office duty in Febrnary, began an exa.mina-

tion of the topographic sheets registered in the archives, with special reference to their need of repair, amendment of titles, and condition of completeness in conformity with the present requirements of the Snrve,y. He had examined upwardi; of eleven hundred sheets up tothe time of being detached for field-service in the month of .Tune. Assistant .J. J. Gilbert reported for office duty in ,January, and was assigned to the computing division. He remained in the office till early in May, and, when not occupied in computing, aided Mr. Schott in the comparison staudardis and IJase-lmrs. Assistant F. W. Perkins was attached to the office during February, March, aml April, and was occupied in an examination of theodolites Nos. 15, 16, 93, and 100; in making plans and estimates for tripod and scaffold signals ; in making a i;eries of practice observations for time and latitude, and in the collection and preparation of material for the field-work which he took up in the month of May. Assistant 0. IT. Tittmann, upon his assignment to office dut~· in January, wa8 directed to examine the records of explorations of tl1e Hnlf Stream, made under instructions from Superintendent. A. D. Bache, with a Yiew of preparing for publication the results already compiled, and such others as need compilation. l\lr. Tittmann completed this work towards the close of March, and during April made such spPcial investigations as were from time t-0 timt\ intrusled to him. In l\lay he began a description of the methods of preciise leYeling as followed in the Survey, and fin. ished it before taking chf1rge of a field-party in June. Assistant Edwin Smith, soon atl.Pr reporting for office duty in October, made a series of comparisons of the st.op-meter of the Saxton dividing-machine wit11 the committee meter, and then prepan·d a room fort he reception of istand:ml balauces. He weighf'd aud adjusted a 11umhe1· of the brai;s kilogramis aud lialf kilograms intemled for distribution to the States, and computed results of the final weighings; tt>sted the new Trot>mnrr halfkilogTam llalauce; rHised p11pers recein>d from the Warden of the Standards, Lo11do11, containing record of the weighings of the United States Arngo platinum kilogrnm with Hie J\liller kilogram, and the determination of the densit.\' of the former; compared six uew stet>l yanll'i; eompared the Rogers provisional bronze ~-ard with tJ1e U 11ited States standard yanl hro11ze No. 11, and, with the aid of Prof. "\V. A. Rog·ers, of Hananl Colleg·e Observat-0r,y, made compai·isou,; of hro11ze yanls (Pratt & Whitne.Y Nos.land 2) with RtNwdanl y:wd bronze No. 11. Before leaYiug the office for the lidd, early in Mardi, he prepa,red the telegraphic longitude instruments for field use. Assistant Andrew Braid reported at the office iu l\fay, and was direct.ed to make a series of observations for the determination of the cof\fficient of refraction upon lines of level over the Potomac River. He deduced the results of these observations, computed the leveling work between Atheiis, Ohio, and Mitchell, Ind., and determined the inequality of pivots of mic_romet.er levels Nos. 2 and 3. Subassistant H. W. Blair, upon reporting for duty about the middle of August, was employed in a comparison and examination of' standards, and in a revision of records aud reductions relating to comparisons of ~eigbtH and measures. He also informed himself fully in regard to the plans for a new base apparatus, and prepared himself for assisting l\lr. Schott in itH construction and verification. In this work, and in the comparisons of the standards and base-bars, his time was chiefly occupied. He made intercomparisons of' Kew F:i.hrenheit thermometers Nos. 966, !H>7, U68, 969, 970, 971, 18411, and 21467; compared the Saxton stop-meter with Berlin brass met.er No. -19 and with the Arago platinum meter, and attemledto some general work relative to st~ndard weights aml measures, including the standarding of a set of alcoholometers for the Internal Revenue Office. In June, having completed the work assigned to him in connection with tbe construction and com· parison of the new five-meter primary base apparatus, Mr. Blair was ordered to field-duty. Mr. F. H. Parsons was engaged upon-office work from the beginning of July till the close of February. He compared the six-meter base-bars Nos. 1 and 2, and 3 and 4; also the four-meter ~nda.ry base-bars Nos. 9 and lo, and duplicated the record of these comparisons; compared twelve thermometers with the standard; examined and adjusted two spring governor chronographs, examined twelve-inch theodolite No. 131; compared sixteen gauges for the Ordnance Office; com-

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

The desirability of a chang-e of the fuu<lnmeutal surface of reference and projection was first distinctly imlicated h,r the rt>Rult of tlic cornliiuatiou of the Nantucket and Pamplico-Cllesapeakc arcs of the meridian and tlle oltl Peruvian are, lint, with the exte11siou of the measure of the oblique arc along the Atlantic coast from Maine into Georgia, the systematic discord between the geodetic and astronomical determinations demanded, for its removal, that a suitable cliange he made in the assumed dimensions and figure of the earth. No adjustment of telegraphic differences of longitude having :yet been made, I subjected t-0 discussion, by application of the method of least sc1nares, tliirty-fonr such dctcrminatious, eut-0ring into Yarious combinations made between the years 1851 arnl 1880, and uniting, thro11gl1 intcrme<liate stations, Greenwich, England, arn.l New Orleans, La. The result of this inYestigation forms now the standard longitude of our triangulations. Theee adjustments will be extcmle<l as the work progresses or new checks are applieil. The work on the Coast and Geodetic Snrww Magnetic Obscryatory at l\fadison, Wis., lias hcen continued. The }Jhotographic traces were read off and tabulated to the end of April, 1881. The operator, Mr. D. l\faso11, resigned Xovcmbcr 11, 1880, and Prof: J.E. Davies undertook temporarily the management of the ollsen·atory, bnt owi11g to other duties awl conseqtwnt waut of' time gave it up, aud l\lr. G. \Y. Suess was placed iu charge l\lay 17, 1881. In co11sc,111cnce of these clmuges t,he work has sufforecl some unaYoidable interruptions, due in part t-0 the iustrume!lts having got out of adjustment, and in part to defectiYe photography. To remedy these defects Mr. \V. Suess visited the obsen·atory J\fay 22, 1881, and provided for its necessities. The suhject of the secular change of the maguetic declination has received my personal attention, autl an improved and greatly enlarged edition (the fourtl1) of rny paper on the seen Jar clmnge of the declination Iias lleeJI brought ont. It is illustrated with three JJlatl'S, and priuted as Appendix \) to the Rc11ort of 187H. It contains tlw latest infor111atio11 011 the ·snl\iect to ,June, 1881. Au iuvestigatiou was made of the tlirection atHl prolmble a111on11t of the 111ag11ctic tlPeli11ation (,·ariatiou of compass) iu the region supposed to contain the lamlfall of Colu111 ll11>< 011 his tirist n1yage to Arncrie<t in Hn~, aud along his track from Palos, Spai11, to Gomera, l\falleira lislautl, and thence to the \Vest Judies. This was accO)upanied by a co111pntatiu11 of' ltiis prolmlile track after lca,·ing Gomera. Special attention was gfreu to the magnetic out.fit of the two polar expeditio11s: the oue to L:tdy Franklin lfay, north of Grecularnl, the other to Point Harrow, Alaska. )fr. l\L Baker had charge of the practical instruction of tlrn ouscr,·1~rs iu the use of tl1e iustrumeuts, for wldcl1, howcYer, the aYailable time was very limited. The demand on the office for special iufilrmatio11 conuected with geodesy, practical astrn1w111y, an(l terrestrial magnetism lrns lJCCH steadily 011 the iucrcasc, and is in proportion with the iucreased area cm·cretl hy tlie operatio11s of tlle Surn~y. .A grcnt porifoa of tuis informatiou is prepared in thiH tliYisiou; besides, certain divisioms of the otlice arc fun\~~jll with data re,1nire·l generally iu the production of charts. 'l'he examinations of the field records, coveriug· tlte subjects mentioned alioYc, for completeness and the care of the duplicate records, were coutiuued as heretofore. The general distrihution of the computing work iunong- the computers has uot varie«l grcat.ly from that of last year, Mr. Christie haying taken the place of l\fr. Main, charged with astronomical latitudes aud azinmtlts; ~Mr. Kumuwll has cl.rnrge of telegrapliie longitudes, the other computers of geodes,r, nml in magnetic computations Mr. Courtenay gave Home assistance. Their work is examined aml reported on lJy mt1, a11d the results am ]H'Otwr]y registered, in which shape they arc readily accessible for immediate m;;e. Between October 8 and October 23, 1880, I wa.s 11laced iu charge of the ofl:ice, duri11g the temporary absence of the 1\ssistant h~Ying charge thereof. The work performed by each computer has been sumumrize<l as follows: Mr. James Main computed the astronomical latitudes of stations, Lum's Point, La., 1880; Lake Providence, La., 1880; arnl t,hc astronomical azimuths of stations, Ll11n's Point, J,a., lia.ke Providence, La., 1880; LoL'l, Cal., 1879; ltouud To11, Cal., 1879; a.11tl furnishc{l 1ncttn places of stars for field parties.

Self.rcgisteriug tide-gauges lmve been hut little used iu the ordiuar.r work of hydrograpl1ic parties, partly, no doubt, because gauges of this form were not well adapted for such pnrpoRes, aml 1)artly on aceount of their expense, though it can hardly he qneRt.ioned that mnch better work would be done with them iu places wl1ere they can be cmweuiently established. At present, owing, it seems, to the te1liousness of making continuous obserYations with staff or box gang't~8, such parties often content themsekes with obsen·ing tide1:1 only during the hours while soundings are being taken. With such imperfect tidal data the reduction of the soundings must be liable to some uncertainty, especially where there is large diurnal ine<111ality or single-day tides. It seems reasonable to expect that some remedy will he fournl for this. All tidal observations made by hydrographic parties are inspected by me when recefred at th~ office, and most, of t11e111 are reduced by the tidal division. Notices of them will be found in the statements of work done in tl1e diO'erent sections of t.he Survey. There are fonr gauges uow in the offic<,, three of which need some I'('llliin,; and new dri>ing elocks to fit them for efficient working. Office irork.-Most of the tabulating of higJ1 and low waters aml hourly ordinates is now done from the curves by the observers before sending the records to the oflice, antl the tabufar reductions are sent hy separate mail. The risk of losR is thus guarded against, and the observerR become more expert and skillful.

With two exePptimrn, the ltydrograpllic operaations have been comlucted by otliem·s tfotailed from the N:w~·. In these two cases this class of work has heen progrt·ssing in conjnnetfrm with the topography nuder the direction of tl1e ci,·il assish1nb~ of the Surrny, and the progress is detailrnl in the reports of cllief:s of parties. Repairs and equipment of nes.~els.-llesides the usual repain; incident to the natural 11<1c:ty of vessels in sen·icc, the steamer A. n. lfache lias had suuli extensi\'o repairs as haYe, it is believed, reudere<l lier a more efficient vesi;el tlian when she was first lmilt. Originally constructed of itou, tlrn gmdual deterioration, due to the action of the salt water and other cau_ses on the material, matfo it unsafe for her to remain at sea on the exposed port.ions of our coast, as required, without some protectio11. A complete sheathing of wood thrne inches in thickness has, therefor(·, lieeu place1l upon her, which, being coppered, makes her tlie strongest kind of it composite vessel, uow generally co11ceded fo he the most durable class of ships built, effecting economy by requiring less fre11ueut dockiugs, mul Jess loss of power due to the accumulations of barnacles, grass, &c., on the bottom, co11se11uent1.r s:wiug iu fuel. Besides this, the Bache has heen fitt~;tl with a steam capstau, saving, it is rtiporte1l, from one to two hours })er day for tlte aetnal work of the Snrw1y hy allowing the small crew to take the time that was usually spent in getting under way for the necessary preparat.ions for the day's work, me:ils, &c. Other minor items, such as a donkey IJoiler for heating purposes and <llstilliug watm·, have been a<ltle<l, thus prodding the crew with imre tlrinki11g-water at :ill times, therd1y tlecrnasiug sickuess a.ud permitting the vesi>el to remain in the tieltl a much longer space of time.

of no further use to the Survey was sold. The details of this disaster are given in the report of C. H. Boyd, Assistant. These steamers, together with the schooners Brisk, En;gre, Earnest, U.esearch, Scoresby, Quick, and Yukon, all of whicli have required more or less repairing, are the only vesRelR that have be.en in general service. The barge Beauty, and sloops Kincheloe and Steadfast, have been used as quarters for parties, but have received some repairs to keep them in order. The steamer Arago was fitted out temporaril,v to take the party attached to the Endea,·or while that vessel was undefgoing repairs, and was prepared with only minor items of outfit. Tile following vessels have been laid up for want of means to put them in service, viz: SteauIPr Arago, at League Island, Pa.; Rtf~amer Fathomer, at Washington, D. C.; scl10ouer G. M. Bache, at 'Vasltington, D. 0.; schooner Drift, at Brooklyn, N. Y.; schooner Silliman, at Brookl,vn, N. Y. BeKides these, several of the vessels above mm1tione1l as in service were laid up before the end of the year; the steamer Barataria at Natchez, l\liss.; steamer Hitchcock, at Baton Rouge, La.; schooner Brisk, at Natchez, Mi8s.; schooner Research, at Algiers, La.; sclwoner Quick, at Algiers, La.; schooner Scoresby, at Baltimore, l\Id.; schooner Yukon, at Oakland, Cal.; sloop Steadfast, at Indian River, Fla. Of the vessels not in use at present the steamer Fathomer is so thoroughly out of repair, and would require such an amount to tit her out, with 110 immediate prospect for requiring the services of a vesRel of her class, that I belie\'e it to be to the best interests of the service to sell her. '.L'he imverative necessity for ext.enAirn surveys in the reeeutly acquired Territory of Alaska, for which a vessel of peculiar construction i8 required, warrants me in submitting to you tbe queR· tion whether a special appropriation shoultl not he reqne8te<l from Uongress to enable the sen·ice to build l'mcl1 a vessel. She should, it' allowetl, he hnilt in tlie strou~esl; manner, fully equipped a8 to sail power, euahliug her to nutke the longest 11as:m_g·es nn<ler sail, with auxiliary steam-power to allow ente.l'ing tlifl:icult. a.pproaclws under steam, yet with t.he least amount of fuel possible. Two steam lauucbes should be supplit'tl he1· for carryi11g 011 the surveys iu the most expeditious manner. A vessel lwst adapted to this i-;prviee would he ahont 011e lmntlre<l and thirty feet long, twenty-four feet heam, aud twelve feet depth. This matter was fully discussed with Mr. U. P. Patterson, the late Superinteudeut, and it was his intention to snbrnit estimat.e8 for a steamer of this class. The sale of the Htea.mers Ha.ton Rouge ancl [·'at.lwnwr (if it is deci<lt>d to sell her) and schooners Caswdl, Fauntleroy, and Catalina wonlct, it. iH thoug;ht, w-urrant this extension of' tbe SP,rvice. Personnel.-'l'here ha\'e been doing dnt.y in Uw Survey tluriug the past year an average of about fifty officers and three hundred aml fifty me11, who h:we been det~tiled hy the Niwy Hepartme11t for hydrographic work. Ou the 11th December, 1880, Commamler E . .P. Lull, U. S. N., was detached from duty as hydrographic inspector of tbe Survey, aud Lieut. Commamler C. M. Chester, U. S.

Ackley, ha\'iug been his full term in charge of a party, was detached from the schooner E:1gre, and the command of that vessel given to Lieut. H. G. 0. Colby, U. S. N.

TYPE FORMS OF TOPOGRAPHY, COLUMBIA RIVER.
WASHINGTON, D. C., J11ly 1, 1881. SIR: In obedience t.o your iiuitrnctfom; for the prosecution of field work in the basin of the Uolumhia Riwr for the Topogrnphical 1\'fanual, I commenced tbe stlr\'ey of the Dalles on the 20th of August latst, and completed the same September 23. (See lllustmtion No. ;),3.) At this reach the river has worn through and carried away the successh'e layers of basalt for a, depth of about 1,000 foet below the present summits, and, as the crests of the eiscarpments are still Yisihle nearly to the summits, a fine opportunity is presented for the study of the type forml'l. The whole volume of the river here runs, for about one and a half miles, through a narrow gorge worn in the basaU, aven1ging about one hundred meters in width and but sixt.y meters wide at its narrowest part. During the snmnrnr freshet it is much increased in volume, overflows its ioclosing- walls, follows and overtlows 8ome inf('rior parallel gorges, and is thus greatly increased i11 witlth. · 'l'he water rntshes and foaml'l throug-11 the main gorge with great. velocit,_y, ha\'ing a fall, at the time of our surYey, of about twenty fret to the mile. · The strata exposed average about seYent.v feet in thicknel'ls, aml incline towards the ocean about one hundred and forty feet in a mile. They were all found to be tli8tinct layers of basalt., except at a point on the southeast side of the river and seven hundred feet above the present rh·er lenil, where a deposit of lime is found; an interesting geological faet, historicaUy. While the snrvey was in progress a fM'orahle opportunity was taken to make a trir of ob!'lervation up the river as far as Wallula, which furnh;hed many objects of topographical interest. The basin of the Columbia consist,s of many layers of basalt of snch wide area and remarkable nniformit,y of thickness as to have recp1ired the emission of a mass of fused rock such as could only have come through great fissures. As the forms of hills and mountains composed of eruptive rocks are mainly due'' 1. To the J>i:esence or absence, paucit,Y or profusion of structural planes; " 2. To the i1hysical chamcter of the rocks 1 "3. To their mineral constitution; " 4. To their chemical composition; " all of wl1icb give direction to the forces of disintegration and erosion, so several distinct types, in accordance therewith, are plainly visible, which comprise the great mass of forms constituting the topography of the basin. The rock, believed to be 3,000 feet thick, remains iu most cases undisturbed in position, with a gentfo inclination towards the ocean. The simple;;t form presented is the nearly level plain of the undisturbed stratum. The next is that where, in several successive layers, the whole of the dd>ri,s of each escarpment has been carried away, and a succession of complete sharp escarpments and fiat benches is left, forming a profile of the following character: These are usually found near the river level, where the lower e.scarpments are within .reooh of the annual floods, and are subject to the maximum atmospheric aqueous action. Immediately above these, where the forces of disintegration are· in excess of those of removal, the escarpments are found with a decided talus of debris, rounding oft' the re.entering angles and forming a profile of the following character:

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

125

Still farther towards and at thP, 1mmmits the cresti; of the eRcarpments disappear altogether, and the forms become those assumed by loose mat.erial over successive rigid planes, under the ordinar,r action uf aqueous aud atmospheric influences. Where a columnar stratum has its base below the leYel of the riYer, the erosfon and abrasion fracture the prisms, leaYiug some stauding alone, or scattered in groups at different heights, Jlre· seuting the following well-known character: Ju a stratum of homogc11eous character, not broken into regular forms byconcretiouary action in cooling, t>,rosiou prorhH'('S irregular conical forms like pinnaeles, as shown helow. In some cases a stratum of this character licsimmediately under one of markt'd columnar structnn'. A form frequently seen is whc:>rc a deep indPntation has been worn into a basaltit· escarpment (columuar) extending to the base of the next escarpment above. The loose dibriH from the upper escarpment finds its way through the fracture in the lmwr OJH , and forms with the debris of the fracttue upon the g-encral taluK a ronmleil o\·erlying talus projecting into the riYer, thm;: At a reach ahovP the ca.scades thl' inclination of the cscar1nnent.'l towards the rh-er on hoth sirles suggests a possible remornl of the lO\n'r strata while the upper ones were in a viscous state, so that they bent h.r their own weight. It is possible, howe\·cr, that the nmlermi11i11g· may have been comparatin~ly recent, and the masis falling so large that the fmctures 011ly appear 1111der the water, and too far back from the river to be observed therefrom. The latter is the more prohable, inasmuch as at another point, as I was informed, dead fir trees are standing at a con' sidera.ble depth in the water. As fir trees do not live in water, they must have grown at a higher level, unless the level of the river should have risen by obstruction in its course below. Most other forms not included in these types will be found to be fragmentary and due to local causes, but can be traced ba.Qk without difficulty to the successive basaltic overflows.

TERRESTRIAL .MAGNETISM.
DIRECTIONS FOR MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS WITH PORTABLE INSTRUMENTS.

[ Thirtl aud eularged edition,· with 4 plat,,s, j

JANUARY, 1882.
i . T11tr111f11ctory rc11111r~~~.-This paper had its origin in a desire to facilitate the field-work of terrestrial magnetism nntlertaken by the snrwy and to secure uniformit;r in the records and computations, and a8 8tIClt was originally inteuded to form part of a Coast Survey Manual of lm;tmctions. With regard to the fir1>t,uamed o~ject the instructions are gh·en in sufficient detail to enable the observer to produce a8 aceurat~ results aR his instruments will admit of; with reference to the second object forms are given hoth for recording observations and for computation. The principles and practical mcthod8 are given in succinct statements and are illustrated by examples drawn from observations. The measure of the magnetic force at any ylace on the earth's surface comprises the determi11atio11 of its 11iredio11 aud its i11tm1sity; the former is generally given with reference to the planes of the n1eridi:rn a1H! of the horizon and the latter is expre8sed either in relative measure or in a hi;olute nwasnre, depe11ding 011 ~he uuit of force selected. There are two classes of observation1> m:Hle on the SUITPy, each employing specially adapted instruments. They are of an essentially tlifkreut clmractcr, the first giving results exprnssed in absolute measure, the second yielding ditlerential results only. ·with these latter, or differential observations made at fixed magnetic ohserrntories and needing photography for continuous registry, this paper is not concerned; but it will co11tain a full account of the usual methods, instruments, records and computations employed in magnetic 1mrveys on shore in which portable instruments are used. \Yherm·er we may expose :t maguet, free to 1110\'e, we will find the space it occupies traversed hy lines of for·ce, due to the magnetism of the earth, and the magnet will place itself with its axis parallel to these lines of force. The direction of the magnetic force at any place and time will then be known by the direction a freely suspended magnetic needle will a.."'iSume and will be defined by the azimuth of the vertical plane passing through the magnetic axis of the needle and by the angle in that plane this axis makes with the plane of the horizon; the former angle is generally known as the magnetic declination (and by the navigator as the variation) and is measured in the plane of the horizon; the latter angle is generally known as the magnetic clip or inclination and is measured in a vertical plane. The intensity of the earth's magnetic force, acting in the direction of a freely suspended needle, is known as the total force at that place and time; it may be made the sul~ject of measure, but more frequently the measure of the horizontal component of the magnetic force is preferred. The force with which a magnetic needle will resist any attempt to deflect it from its posit.ion of equilibrium depends upon the intensity of the earth's magnetic attraction as well a1> upon the magnetic moment of the magnet, and the latter has therefore to be sepa· ratetl from the former before we can express the magnetic force in absolute measure. In general the horizontal component can be determined with greater accuracy than either the tot.al force or its vertical component. While in the scientific treatment the direction and intensity of the magnetic force are inscpl\rably connecte<l, it is tlifforent in the practical appli<>,ation of magnetism for the uses of the surveyor and navigator, to whom the tlirective property of the magnetic needle jg of far greater interest an<l value than the magnitude of the force. Thus, the surveyor jg frequently

called upon to retrace old magnetic courses by which land boundaries had been originally defined and which in the course of time had fallen into litigation; to do this effectively he will not only require to know the magnetfo declination at 11resent and at the place in question, hut he must also possess an accurate knowledge of the secular change of the declination* in order to make JJroper allowance for its effect duriug the interval between the two epochs of' the surn·y. In the d:iily practice of navigation the solution of the problem of converting magnetic into true hearing is con. tinually required; this involves on the part of the navigator a knowledge of the magnetic declina.tion for the place and time, while the int;ensity enters entirely as a matter of secondary importance in the treatment of the cleviation of his compass clue to the disturbance of tlw ship's rnaguetism and, may be, that of the cargo. The methods for measuriug the declination, dip and intensity on board ship will not be inclucled in this paper and rnm~t be sought for in treatises 011 uavigatiou; they are, however, not essential!~· different from certain methods employed on shore and can readily be understood. At sea the azimuth compass takes the place of the decliuometer for the determination of the horizontal direction and the Fox circle is substituted for the dip and int~usity circle in determining the inclination aud relative total force which, by the aid of a land station, can finalJy be expressed in absolute measure. 2. Selection of stations.-The subject can most conveuintly be presented under the healls: 1. Determination of the magnetic declination. 2. Determination of the maguetic dip. 3. Measure of the magnetic force . .Before entering upon it some remarks are d(·simble respecting a proper selection of stations at which to make obRerrntio11s. The prineipal couditiou that ought to lw satistied at itny station is that of freedom from possible disturbing influence, either i11 the 8oil itself or from near presence of iron; places near foundries, 8t.eamhoa.ts and locomotives, aud o~jt>ets of irou or steel, as guns, pipes, railings, rafters, rails, posts, rods, wires, &c., c:m r1~a1Iily be avoided, though no genera] rult>. can be given of what might be regarded a. safe dista111\e, whiel1 rna.y var,Y from 50 to 500 meters or more. The geological forma.tiout of the locality cannot be 11rnde a gni<le whether or not local deflections exist, since snch influence may be quite deeply seatRd; but it is recommended iu all casei:; t.o make Hpecial instrumental frl'lt for loeal distm bance by canyiug au azimuth com puss succes1>livt>ly over a Sl'ri1·8 of point:.; alo11g two Rf raight li11t>s <'fOl'l'i11g eal'h other at right angles at. the station and ohs1,1Ting at. each poiut the hearing of a distaut object several kilometers or miles off, in order that there may be no parallax (or else allowing for it) a11d comparing the results; if these accord within the inevitable observing error the place may be free from local deflection.

!.-DETERMINATION OF THE MAGNR'l'W DF.CLINA'.l'ION.

3. Definition.-The magnetic declination of all.'' place, heing tl1e angle contained hrtween the astronomic and magnetic meridians, requires for its measure two distinct operations, name!.'·: The determination of the astronomic meridian, whicl1 is geuerall.'· doue h.Y means of a theodolite; aud the derermination of the magnetic meridian by means of the declinometer or unifilar magnetometer. The former of these planes is fixed, the latter variable, and the ohservati011s may have for their object the derermination of the declination at a gin<u epocli or hour of tlle day, or of it1>1 average value for any one day, month, or year. 4. l!'ind,ing tlte true meridian.-Respecting the determination of the astrouomic meridian from observations of the azimuth of the sun or of a star, full iuformatiou will be found in the third edi·See paper on Secular Change of Magnetic Declination in the United States au<l at some Foreign Stations, fourth edition, in Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1879, Appendix No. 9. Washington, 1881. t In his report of 1878-'79, Appendix VII, of the Geological Survey of Canada (Montreal, 1880 ), !\Ir. Selwyn, di rPctur of the survey, remarks: "Among other causes iu1luencing the magnetic declination in this region (vicinity of Lake Winnipeg) besides that of change in the geological formation on a large scale, 1 have noticed l1e11R of ruagn .. tie iron, deposits of iron sand, dikes of diorite, great magnetic bowlders, sutl<len change int.he general levd, proximity of a clift' or bank or even of a thick grove, or when very close, a single large tree." In the last-mentioned cases, if true, evidently very peculim: conditions of aetion of electrio currenta had to be supposed.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

t.ion of a paper entitled, "Determination of Time, Longitude, Latitude, and Azimuth," in Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1880, Appendix No. 14. The example of observations and reduction given in Artiele 1 r of the part treating of t.lie azimuth is taken from a record made in connection with magnetic work. It may be stated that for magnetic purposes a ver.r moderate degree of accnra<\Y suffices in tbe determination of the true meridian and a correct knowledge of it within r' will in general fully suffice. It is difficult, even in our middle latitudes, to determine the magnetic meridian within the limit of 1 1 on account of the continuous fluctuations, hence any greater accuracy than tbis in the astronomic nrnri<lian would be useless. To define the. true meridian heyou<l its merP circle-reading on the theodolite, the angle between it, and a mark (any cous1)icuous object.) is mensured a111l the true azimuth of that mark beconrns known and is available at any time. In onlpr to olttain tlte mag-netic declination we need only to tind the magnetic azimuth of the mark and tlw differe1we between the true and magnetic hearings is the declination- To disting11i1'111 between west and east declination, a + sig11 signifies that the north (seekil1g) end of the magnet (or needle) or the magnetic north direction lies to the west of the true north meridian, in sliort, wmit declination; a - sign signifies the contrary, or east declination. Theise signs apply to the sonthern :1s well as t-0 the nortl1er11 hemisphere. Before describing· the use of the magnetic instruments proper, the following article will be devot<~d to the adjustment and use of the astronomical theodolite in connection with tLt) determinatiou of tlte true meridional line. 5. Atlju.Ytment of the theoilol:ite nnd a.lt-a.zimuth instrument.-Tbe various operations for placing tlrn partR of a themlo1ite in proper condition for observing, in order to eliminate, as far as possible, somces of error arir-;ing from i11strunwntal defects, may be briefly stated as follows: To ((({ju.~t the ltwl.~.-After properly setting up the stand, clamping it and mounting the instrun1e11t, :hljuRt tlw rno:-;t Reusitive of the le\·ets attached to it hy brillging two of tlie foot-scl'ews of tlte tlwo<lolitc in line with the direction of the lenil, 1wd after leveling, turn tlie azimuth circle 1800, corr.,ct ai1y defoct, 01w-half by means of the foot-screws (always working tliem in opposite directions), llw other half by meau:-; of the a<l,insting-screws of the level; tum the circle ba.ck to first position a111l mpmtt the (mrtectiou as befortl a>; often a:,; may he necessary. If during this operation we turn the circle once or twice at rigl1t angles to the former positiou aml make the bnhhle play in the lllifldle hy turning the thil'd foot-scrnw of the theodolite, there may be no need of 11si11g- tile r1rwt1w.tio11 to etrect tile adjustment of the Je\'el, the turning of 1800 by estimation being imflieient. to t-tlect tlie JHH'jnme. If tllere is a secontl level attachi>d to the circle at right angles to the former, it may be adjusted like the first, or more expeditiously, by }llacing it in the same direction al'.l the first (when in adjustment) aud correctiug any defect by its correcting screw. Circular levels must be adjusted upon the same principles; they are, however, generally of inferior accnraey. To pla.ce the ttJ'is of tlie uzfowtli-circle ~'ertimil.-By means of the adjusted level we 1llace the vertical axi.~ in 1wsit.ion b,r leveling t.hti instrument with the two foot-screw.., paral1el with the direction of tlie Jere! and tlleu tuming tlle circle 900 and bringiug the bubble again to the middle by turning the third foot-screw. The verticality of the axis is tested by tl1e steadiness of the bubble iu the middle of the t.uhe when the instrument is slowly revolved in azimuth. 7'o 1u1ju.~t the tlmmr111 of the telescope.-Place the threa<ls in the focus of the eye-piece where their hei-;t definition is obtained and test the position by pointing to a distant well-defined o~ject to which t,he focus of the object-glass is adjusted for distinct vision; and if by moving the eye sidewise the object appears to move off the thread or pviutiug in the same direction as the eye, the diaphragm must he slightly pushed in, and pulled out in the contrary case. If there are two threads intnsecting in the middfo of the field at right augles, the vertical thread may be set vertical by sighting a plumb-line suspended at a proper distance, or the vertical edge of a honse may be used i11stt~a11. The whole diaphragm (after loosl'ning its four screwfl) is t-0 be turned around the optical axis to effect the coincidence. The preceding adjustment must not be disturbdd. The horizontal thread may also ue tested by pointing to an object and then turning the azimuth-circle, previously set horizontal, when the oltlect shouJd remain biAActed; it may also be effectoo by pointing on t.be sea-borizou. To at{ju~t tlle line of collimation of the tel1:111cope.-lf the horizontal axis of the telescope admits of being rever>1ed in its supports, a distant object is pointed to; and if, after reversal of the a.xis

in its V1s, the pointing remain perfect, the line of collimation is at right angleR to the axis; if not, half of the diiforence is to be corrected hy the azimuth scrmv and half hy tlie two al\iusting screws of the diaphragm (its former adjustments rem:tining 11tHlifl.tnrhed). If the axiR doeR not admit of reversal in the V's, it must he f(Wersed by reversal of tlw circle, using the graduittiou; and if the' second reading, after reversal, should (lifter from it a little more or less than 1800, the differe11ce must be corrected as beforea11tl the process is to be repeated until the readiugs, direct and reYersed, differ by 180° exactly. Por greater accuracy, we may nRe a collimator instead of the dist:tnt ol~ject. In some instruments the teleRcopes are mount.ell on one side instead of in the middle of the azimuth-circle; their collimation may be oorrected by two distant marks separated exactly hy twice the eccentricity of the axis of the telescope from the vertical axis of the theodolite. The process of adjustment is then the same as described, only changing the mark witll a change of the telescope from one side to the other. For oblique intersections of the threads the poi11t of intersection must be brought into the optical axis of the telescope, the adjustment for collimation being the same as <lescribed. Iu this case a collimator with a yertical thread is used to advantage. To place the horizontal a.ri~ of the telcsco1>e in position.-This axis must, be at right angles to that of the azimuth-circle, and if iu position or horizontal the line of collimation, when revolving the telescope, must pass through the zenith of the observer. His effected by ph1cing au adj11sted Iernl ou the axis and correcting the whole error with the adjusting sprcw of the pivot. If the le,,el is fixe(l or uncorrected, it must he adjusted at the same timn with the axis hy leveling and theu turning the azimuth-circle 1800, an11 eorrecting one-half of the defect hy the pivot-screw and the other half by tlie level.screw. This proeess also requires repetition for its plwfoction. The instrument is now rea~l;-.· for the meaRurement of horizontal a.ngles, either by "directiou8" or hy "ai1gles," with or wit.110ut repetitionR, accorrling to the construction of the instrument or the requirements of the case. In either mctllod one-half of t.he measures must of course he made wi t.11 "circle direct," the other half with "circle reversed" by 180°, which process corrects the augfrs for any 1·mnaininf! defect, after adjustment, in the verticality of the axis, in the height of the V's, iu the form of tlie pivots, aml in the collimation. If the telescope is placed eccentricall.r, this reversal will at the same time refer the resulting measures to the axis of the circle, or what shouhl be the same, to the vertical of the station. In repeating angles it suffices to record the readings of the circle at the commencement and at the end of the operation, the telescope being rC'Yerse<l after half the number of rcpditions an· s1·cure11. During the rm·ersal of the telescope tlw circles remain fi r111 l_y clamped nnt.il aft.t;r the new pointing is made. ·with no11-repeatms, or when used as i,;mch, the records for telescope" D" and for telescope "R" are kept Reparate. The eccentricity of a circle is corrected by taking the mean of the readings of two opposite verniers or microscopes, or tlw mean of the rrntdings of any number of yernit~rR or microsco1wi,.;, provicle<l they are so placed as to divicle the whole circumference into equal parts. To a,dju~t the level require<l for 1'erticnl me<Mures.-The measures of vertical angles depend, among other things, on the accuracy of the adjustment of the level. It is effected hy lernli11g aud reversing the azimuth-circle 180°, using one of the level.screws for correction, provided the former adjustment of the vertical axis has not been disturbed. This h~\'el may eitl1er be attacherl to tlie azimuth-circle or to the arms carrying tl1e \~erniers or microscopes of the a.!titmle-circle; in the. former position it is of course placed parallel to or in 1,he plane of the a.ltitmle-circle. The instrument is now in the llroper condition for the mea.~nre of vertical angles. Generally double zenith distances are measured, by means of which the reflding of the zenith (or nadir) point on the circle becomes known and con8e(111w-it1y all'.!o t.he reading of the 11orizon. If there is any index-error, it may either be corrected (many instrumentl'.! admit. of such a correction) or it may be allowed for as a constant when single altitnrles are measured. This index-error is of no consequence if double zenith-distances are taken (in,·olving positions 7 circle right. and circle left.). Owing to the great diversity in the construction of theodolites, depemling upon the particular use and the degree of perf1:1ction required of tbem, rules cannot be given to apply alike to all constructions; but the preceding notes 011 adjustment will suffice in all ordinary cases of the nse of the portable instrument. To test the grH,(l11at.io11, it.'! eccentricit.r, s.rst.ematic and irregular errors; to acljust the reading microscopes (for run and focus); to test the coincidence of the two horizontal S.

axes, also of the two vertical axes, in repeating instrttments; to examine the perpenclicularity of the planes of the circles (graduation) to their respective axes; to measure the flexure of the telescope aud other circnmRtauccs, will require tlie atteution of the observer wheu engaged in the more refined geodetic or astrouomical u8e of the alt-azimuth. The principle of repetition applies mo8t a(lvantageousl,y wlien the optical power of the telescope exceeds relati\-ely the accuracy of the graduation; in other words, when the pointing-error is less than the graduation-error. If the optical power is inferior, or not commeusurate with tlie perfectiou of the graduation, we may still use the method, the uurnber of repetitions being arrauged so as to spread the readings over the graduation. Although the principle of repetition is au elegant one, iu practice it has been found frequently to introduce a new source of error, namely, a constant or slowly variable error depending on imperfection of the clamping, friction and general instability of the instrument. Unless the clamps are perfect, repeating will introduce a constant error, which cannot be eliminated from the result by the forward and backward movement of one circle upon the other and the observer should carefully test whether m not his pointing will be preserved when repeated I~' clamping and unclamping; this esp1mially applies to the clamps upon which the movement of the inner circle depends (for repeaters). The clamps and tine motion screws should never he at the circumference of the circle of gmduation, hut near tl1e axis, uuless for inferior instruments. Before a(\justing the instrument its clamping apparatus should be exarniued as well as the proper amount of friction of the moving parts and the balancing of weigl1ts. Instruments with light spokes to their azimntl1-circleR (though they may otherwise be high or thick enough), and having a heaY~' superstructure (vertical circle aud counterpoise), frequently Rhow so nmcb flexure or spring as to aflect iujuriousls all horizontal measurrn·, while full thin plates are not liable to this defect. Azimuths in connection with tlie magnetic declination, where an accuracy of a fraction of a minute suffices, may be obtained with a small alt-azimuth instrument sa,v of four or five inches diameter (about 10 to };{c11 ·)- ~npposing the latitude given, but the time only approximately known, the sun's zenith distance and azimuth may be ousen'etl aR follow8: reading of mark, three readings of the sun's upper and first limb, with noting of the chrouometer tinw of conta.ctR; instrument re\Tersed, three readings and timing of the sun's lower and second limb, reatling of mark.

6. Adjush>ient of the declinometer and maunetometer.-Tbat form of construction of tb<~ instrument which has the box with its suspended magnet mounted over the center of the gnuluat~d or azimuth-circle and which is due to the late Dr. Lamont, of l\Iunich, is generally known on the Survey as a theodolite-magnetometer (see No. 35 of the accompan.)·ing plates). It ii:; m1pecially well adapted for work iu a fixed observatory, gives superior accuracy to the measure of the horizontal force and will always indicate the magnitude, howeYer large, of any disturbance in the direction of the declination. On the other baud it is not suited, except roughly, for tlle determiuatio11 of the astronomical azimuth, for which reason the second form of instrmneuti:'\ iK preferred in magnetic surve._ys. This form, which wal'l the earlier one, waR gi\"en by Hauss anll Weber (see No. 34 of platRs); the theodolite, or alt-azimuth, is detached from the magnetic part of the instrument; it is known eitller as a "tleclinometer," if not provided with means for determining intensity (such ais a second or deflecting magnet, deflecting bars, mass ring, &c.) or as a "magnetometer," if it is pro· vitled with all ueecsisary appliances for determining dt,'Clination as well as absolute horizontal magnetic force. In the earlier 1wactice on the Surve;y the theodolite was mounted on a separate stand aud collimated with the magnet at a distance of a few cedimetres; later on, however, theodolite and magnet box were mounted closely together ou a board resting on a tripod. This grea,tly facilitated the operation of collimation. More recently a combination instrument was de,·ised (see No. 36 of accompanying plates). It ma.r be described as an alt-azimuth instrument which admits of a removal of the upper structure (the Y's, telescope and vertical circle) and the substitution for it of the box with suspemled magnet and attached reading telescope. Here, then, we have two te.lescopes, but the advantages of each of the two forms of iustnnnent combined in m1e. The oh. server may arrange bis magnet so that in collimating he may either look south (1mtgnctically) or north aud the changP. from one directio11 to the otl1er can be made by exchanging the Jeni-; a1ul the plane glass of the collimator magnet; hut if, as usual, this magnet is also used a8 inteui-;ity magnet or serves for oscillations, it 11m8t not he disturbed br any such exchange <~ltcr the con>1ta11t8 hm:e been once determined. Wl1en using iu tield~work a declinorueter or maguetomet~r witb sepamte theodolite it will be found prcforable for the ohsen'cr to stand north of his instrument and looking south in collimating, as in this ca<>e he may more readily manipulate the theodolite for olisei·yationK of azimuth without taking off ti1e magnetic box. Should be mm a theodolite mag11Pto111ctcr or the comhi11atio11 instrumeut, he will find it advantageom; to collimate looking north, a8 tlit~ s1111 will then interfere less with vision, and generally he ma~· throw more reflected light through the collimator. There are other forms of magnetic instrumeuts for the determination of the declina. tion and the inten8ity, but these offer no special 1lifficulty in tl1eir use. The station having been selected, a]lparently free from local magnetic disturbance, tbe instrument is mounted with the sides of the box containing tlm magnet direckd nearl~· north itml son th magnetic, which may be done most conveniently by means of a small compass needle; then the instmment will be leveled and the theodolite with telescope will be adjusted. The motion of the magnet is controlled by the obserYer by means of a small piece of magnetized steel (a small screw-driver, for instance), its magnetism (at its free encl) being the same as that of the end of tpe magnet facing the observer, so as to repel it when brought near. It mm;t neither be too strong, nor oo brought too close to the magnet, otherwise the 1wsition of the magnetic axis might be disturbed. The suspension-tube should carry at its top a rack and })inion to admit of au easy vertical movement of the magnet. With a piece of cloth at the bottom of the box, the magnet can oo let down and allowed to come to rest by friction on the fibers of the cloth; it can then be raised and quickly steadied by the magnetized screw-driver, all without opening the liox, which in windy weather must be avoided. The sides of the l>ox, if of glass sliding in grooves, must have pasteboard covers to darken it, and the width of the slit facing the mirror must be specially regulated for the best definition of the scale; the shade placed over the o~iect end of the telescope should nearly oouch the box, in order that all stray light may be excluded. The special adjustments to be made a.re the following: Suspend the torsion-cylinder, which is of the 8ame weight precisely as the magnet and take out the twist of the suspension-fibers, of which there should not oo more than are absolutely needed t.o support the weight without risk of breaking-say about 4 or 6 for the older heavy magnetiS and 1 or 2 for the light ones. With the aid of the ra.ck·motion and the friction on the cloth, the whole

tnrnH of twist are readil,v taken ont, and then the line of detorsion must be placed in the magnetic meridian, in which position the axis of the torsion-weight mm!t b_e parallel with the side of the hox.* lu packiug-i the suspension should be kept free of twit;;t, so that at any new station only the Hmall changeH developed in the twist during t.he interval need attention. The weight should be rcmored, the rnag11et suspended and t.he telescope pointed nearly to the middle of its scale, or to the axis of tlie maguct. 't'he axis of the collimator and the line of collimation of the telescope shouJ<l tht>ll ht-, :us 11earl,v as possihlc, in the same st.raight line. To render the scale distiuct, the telescope must he sl't to sidereal focuK. The azimuth-circle is then read; the reading, when pointing t-0 the mark, t ha\·ing previously been recorded. The relative position of the theodolite and magnet is, of courne, iuvariable, hoth being supported by the same stand. The scale-reading of the magnetic axis of the collimator is determined by readings with scale erect aml inverted, as shown in the following example:

No'J'E.-lt is recomrneudf'.d to make these observations about the epoch of the day when the magnt-t is nearly 8tationary, or between 7 :uul 8 a. m., from May to. September, inclmsive; in March, April, and Octolwr, about 8 a. m. and in .January, February, November, and December, about 9 a. m.; also about 1 ;/z p. m. in an~' month and in any part of North America. The angular value of a division of the scale is determined by successive pointings on the principal divisions and uoting the corresponding readings of tlic azimuth-circle, and repeating the operation ill the reverse order. With that form of the instrument which haR the box of the magnet connected wit,h the aumuth.circle, the combination of the resulta will correct for change of declination during the measures, but a small correetion for torsion may be needed; for the other form of construction the maguet may be fast;ened in its normal position during the scale measures. The usual value uf a scale-dh'ision is between 1 1 and 31 aud tenths may be estimated. It is onJy for those instruments which give primarily the amount of deflection, in the intensity-measures, expressed in scale-divisions, that an accurate determination of the scale-value is neede'd.

·This proc081! may require ro1ietition until the observer is al!Bured that there is no torsion when the collimatormai;:net. is suspended. t'fhe best i;ositiun of the mark is in or near the horizon.

Jfouee oue di\Tisiou of seale=2'.797 No'.l'E,_:If the number of pointings is odd i11st{lad of even, ais above, the mean readiug COIT<'· spondiug to the m.iddle division must he found and subtracte1l from each separate value. The 1lifferences so obtained must be added, and their sum (irresiwetin~ of sig11)~ whl·n di,·ided by the corresponding number of scale-divisions, will furnish the desired value. For an example of the amount of torsion, as measured from four twigt.s of 900 each, see "Observations for Intensit,r-Oscillations" further on. Moistening the fibers with a !'!mall drop of g-1,vceriue will greatly reduce aud equalize the torsion. It appears from observations of the daily fluct1ut.io11 of the declination t.hat. the nwan of thl· extreme easterly and westerly positions in any one da;r approaches nearly (wit.l1in half a minute) to the mean position of the day, as derived from hourl,Y observations continued day aml night. Since corrections to ohserved declinations to refer them to the mean of' the day are generally very unsatisfactory, it, is reeommended to observe the declination for any one day at the epochK of the eastern magnetic elongation and of the western magnetic elongation and to take the mean position as representing the declina.tion for that da.y. The epochs of extreme positions, as ohse1Tcd at Pl1iladelphia, Washington, and Key West, a1iply, with compa.ratively small chauges, to nearly all places within the United Stat.es and may be stated to be as follows: Referring to the north eml of the magnet, the morning eastern elongation occurs, ou the average, from 1\fay to Sept,ember, irrnlnsin-, about 7y.; a. m.; in Marcli, April, and October, about 8 a. m.; in Novemher1 about 8~,f a. m. and in December ,January, aml },ehruary, about 9 a. m.; earliest tiR1e in August, about 7 ){ a. m., latest in January, about 9 a. m. These epochs, however, are sul~ject to grea.t. ttuctuat.ious and cannot be de11ended upon in auy oue case within one boor and frequently Uwy cannot be recoguized at all, either on account of the small range of the thtily ftnctnat.ion-t.he amount of which in winter is but one-half, nearly, of the amount in smnmer-which is easily disguised h,v ,;mall irmgularities, or on account of disturbances, which reach tlieir maxima in Sept(~mber and October aud generally are more predominant in winter than in summer. The afternoon ice.stern elongation occurs, on the average, about 1 ?,( p. m. from May to November, inclusive anti a.bout l ~ p. m. in the remaining months; also, earliest in September-some minute:;; before 1 p. m.-and lat~st in January, about ·U p. m. The afteruoon epoch is subject to kss fluctuation than the lllQl'lling

epoch. . The following table .will be found useful for correcting or reducing an observation of the declination taken at any time between 6 a. m. and 6 J). m. to the mean of the day (or to the mean of 24 hourly observations). It is, however, only approximate, since the tabular values are slightly

For interpolation for any place in the Unitecl States we may consider that, roughly speaking, the greater the horizontal force the smaller the tabular values, or the range of the daily variation iR nearly inversely proportional to the horizontal force. For comparison we have the horizontal force Hat Toronto =J·so, at Philadelphia= 4.16 and at Key West 6.74 nearly. No notice iR taken of the annual inequality, which may amount to about one minute and a half, in maxi mo.

The Toronto results are derived from observations of five years ending June 30, 1848. Tlie Pliiladelphia results are derived from observations of five years imding June 30, 1845. The Key West. results are derived from observations of six years ending April, 1866. For reducing observations to mean of day (24 hours) the signs of the tabular quantities must be rm,ersed. The following tables of the times and azimuths of Polaris wl1en at elongation have boon prepared for the benefit of those surveyors awl others \\'ho may prefer to make URe of the pole-star for their determination of the trne meridian and whose instrumental outfit for tbe measure of the doolina· tion may be. limited to~ compass with sights or t,o a. small theodolite with compa&s-need.Je attached and who may be without a chronometer.

II.-DI<~'l'ERMINA..TION

OF '.l'HE MAGNE'rIC INCLINATION.

8. DeNcription of in.~trument.-The inclination, or dip, is measured iu the Yertfoal plane JHlSRing· through the rnag11etic meridian of the place aud is the angle contained between a borizo11tal direction and the direction of a magnetie needle mm·ing freely auont a horizontal axis whieh ii; directed east and west magnetically. It is rneasuted by means of a dip-circle and ii-I eo11Hidered + wbeu the north cud of the needle dips below the horizon. Thus in the northern magnetic hemisphere the dip will be noted + antl in the sonthern mag11eti1· hemfaphere-. In a plainly constructml circle, the graduation, which is direetly read off opposite the Puds of the needle, is geuerally not closer than qrrnrter degrees or ten minutes and snhdi\'isions are to he estimatd. In the more elaborate instruments, like those made after the Kew patwm," for irn~brncP, the needle does not. swing in the plane of the graduated circle awl the pointing at ernl-marks 011 the needle is done by the aid of two microscopes, with threads i11 the focus and the circle is read off to the nearest minute or half-minute b,y means of t,'WO verniers. The latter coustructio11 iH ad\'antageous onl,v witl1 well-balanced needles, having as perfect!,,, c,dindrical axles as can be made. The circles are also provided with means for determinining relative total intensity. Por this purpose they are supplied with perforated or Lloyd needles for deflection by weights, and have a support for deflections hy a plain so called intensity needle 1 specially su1iplied. Diamefor of vertical and of horizontal circles about 13 cm.; lengtl1 of needles, 9 cm. 9. Adju8tnient of <lip-<fircle.-Iu adjusting the dip-circle, preparatory to obsening, the followi11g conditions should be satisfied as near as may be and the observations should lie arrang·ed so as to eliminate any small out,standing defects in the adjustment of the iustmment: It shonld be leveled, or its vertical axis should be set truly vertical. The agate or steel plat.es t:mpport.iug· the needle should have their upper surfaces level; they should be of equal height aml a horizontal tangent-plane to these surfaces sl1onltl pass below the center of graduation at a distance equal to the radius of tlie axle or piYot of the needle. The zero graduation of the dip-circle sl.ould, for convenience, lie in or close to a horizontal plane passing through the center of the circle; also, the planes of the faces of the suspended needle and that of the circle should be truly vel'tical; m.id finally, the prolongation of the axle of the needle should pass through the center of graduation. For instruments provided with microscopes the following additional conditions should he satisfied: The microscopes must be focussed for distinct vision of the ends of the needle and for their 1i.>cal tbread.s; these threads should be placed in the line of collimation, and for the two microscopes, should be 180° apart; and, if prodncell, the threads should pas8 throngl1 the center of graduation To aid in these adjustments of the focal threads it is recommended to suspend in the vertical plane

of the face of the ueedle by means of a lum11 of bees-wax, a fine silk fiber lightly weighted at its lower· end, so ms to hang freely and accurat,ely over the ceuwr of graduation. 'l'o place the dip-circle in the plane of the magnetic meridian, we liave t.wo ways, eitl1er by the aid of au ordiuar_y long compass-needle, wl1ich is supported on the top of the wooden frame of the im;tnuuent, m· ll.Y means of the 1lippinii-1rnedle itself~ which will point vertically when in the plane of the mnµ:netic prinw n\rtical. Tlw former method is more expeditious; the latter can alwa~'s be resorted to a11d co11sistl'I in fonr readiugi'i of the azimuth-circle of the instrument when placed successively in the 1wsitiovs: face of circle south (magnetic), with face of ue1idlf' sont.J) and face of needle north; nest, face of circle north, with face of needle north and face of needle south; the mean reading + 9o0 and - 900 will then gi\'(' the settings of the circle for the measure of the dip ill the magnetic meridian. A_ more precise n~lue will be fonnd if the process iii repeated, with the polarity of the needle re,·ersed. The azimuth-circle ii'i proyided with two stops, against which the case with mwdle will abut; one for face of circle east, tbe o'ther for face of circle west. The needlel'I, befom magnetization, should bahuice perfectly, and those intended for tlw relative memmre of total iuteusit,y, ac<\orcling to Dr. Lloyll's method, should he guarded as much as possible agai11st any change in their mag11eti1>.rn. It will he noticed tllat the mean resulting dip will, hy the rerer.ml of the dip-circle, be free of a11y small error in the lnel or the Yertkality of axis aud eliminaw any index error; tliat the reuersnl oft.ht: jiu:e of tltc needle ou the agateis will, like the 1irst, free the result from ettect of imperfection in its trawfferse halauce mid trom Hon-coincidence of its geometrical and magnetic axes and that the raenml of the polarity of the 11ee1lle will correct, for any defect iu the position of' its center of' graYity with n·spect to :my longitudinal dit;tance from the axii:> of :rotation. 10. RererNo/ of pole.~ of dippi11g-neellles.-The needles which are exclush·ely usml for the measure of the inclination ·sho11hl have th.-ir poles reversed at each place of ohseryation and the results with polarity north arnl polarit,y south must be combined to a mean value. If exceptionall:r·, from waut of time, tlte JlOlarit.r sltonld 11ot have llee11 reversed at a statiou, the dilforeuce in results between polarit:t 110rth awl 1'onth, as found at statio11s which have uearly the same dip, may be applied a8 a correctiou. To reverl:>e the 1iolarity we may proceed as follows: fasten the needle in the reversing-block anti, lwltliug a lntr-rnagnet in each hand, bring the opposite poles of the two b:u-mag11ets close together at the middle of' the needle so as to touch the same on botl1 sides of the axle; the needle is supposed to he on a le\·el plane and the ham are to be inclined outward about 2 50 or 3 5° to the hori:wn. 'rhey are tlrnn drawn slowly and steadily over the needle, carrying them Ol'f'I' its cuds anll, after liftiug them some inches ahove the lm·el of the needle, hriug th.em back to tlie middle position and move them again over the surface. This process may be gone through t.hme time8, wl1eu the upper face of the needle is turned clown, in which position the magnetization is repeated as before. Care should be taken to have the motion exactly in the direction of the geometrical axis of the needle; the supporting-block usually has a ledge, along which the magnet can he drawn, closely touching it, which will iusure a moYement parallel to the axis of the umgut>tic ueedle. If its north end is to be changed to a south end, place the north (or marked) end Mer that eml of the neeclle when magnetizing-. The polaz·it.Y as well as the face may be designated by means of' the number or letter usually cut on the face-end of the needle. The reversing-bars should ht> carefull_y handled aml should not be allowed to touch each other except at their opposite poles U]l(l when placed in the box the ends of opposi1R JlOlarity sllould be connected by a soft. iron armature. If tl1P r1wersal of the needle is to be repeated a short time after the operation, the method is onI:v changed by usi11g fonr instead of three passes over eaeb face of the needle; if another reYersal is needed shortly after, five passes would be required. This is done in order first to neutralize the existing magnetic polarity and then to give it the opposite polarity desired; if, however, one 01· more days haxc elapsed between a reversal, enough of magnetism of the needle has been lost to render any increased number of passes unnecessary. 'rhe number of strokes 1fopell(ls primarily on tlie strength of the bars and the relative size of the bars and needles. Should the bars lmve too mue.!1 intensity and the needles be long, au irregular distribution Of magnetism 111igl1t be produced. Should tl1e bars be of unequal intensity, it is recommended to exchange thtim in the liauds, after 11erforming one half of the operation of reversal, turning them at the same time eud for end and completing the o_pemtion int.he new position.

OlnserM.fion.~ .fill" faclinaHrm or ilip.-The following example of a record of onliuary ohse1Tatious of the dip will show sufficiently the general arrangement. 'l'lw readings iu tht' >wcond liorizontal li11e are independent of those of the firo;t, and between these obsern1tio1rn the needle ha;,; always bee11 lifted off itK supports. If' the positi011 of the needle is n·corded whill' slowly oKcillating, it is customary to n·cord the left and right extreme t>xcursions and, in order to correct for 1li111iuution of arc, the mean of the reading of tlie first extt·e111e aud of it;; 11ext retnm to it 8honld he taken before eornhining with the reading of tlw oµposite extreme. In this case the lll('aJt for the first extreme Jiositiorn; may be taken mcutally and tlw second (·xtreme iK reconled nrnlt·r it; tlwn t(lllow the readings corresponding to the second line after the needle has been lifted off aud let down again on the agate 8npport,s. 'l'he letter:-; S. a111l N. i11 the form below stand for south (upper) aml north (lower) cud of' tht' needle, wht'll suspended. It is recommended to observe the needle while slowl;y oscillati11g iu preference to noting it8 11ositio11 at rest, i11 which latter case the equilibrium ma~· be influenced by any small irregularit;.· in the axle at the point of contact, which, it may he supposed, would lw pas8ed on·r by au oscillating motion. Defects in the figure of tlte axle nm~· al8o he recognizt'd h~· irregularities in tLe oscillatoQ· motion of the needle. TLe iutro<lnctiott of position needles had11g a moYahfo axle, which may be tnrued b~· means of a key to different positions, with a Yiew of elimiuatiug small detects in the figure of the axlt~, 11as, so far, not proved as satisfactory as was anticipated, owing to the difticnlty of pr,rfoctly figuring the axl1· a1Hl centering the montble arbor; if sueh needles are used their polarity, after the first set of obsernttions have been made, will be nwersed and the ohserYations will be concllHled before tuming to a new positioi1.

It is desirable that in the various positions of Jhe circle and needle the extreme readings should keep within a range of 1° or 20; the closer the better will be the final result. 12. Ob1wrrat-ions of <lip in r1u-io11.v azimutlts.-For the purpose of tel'lting the regularity of tlrn figure of the axle of Uie needle aml the freedom of the metal of the circle from any magnetism, we may observe dips in various azimuths; if fla =observed dip i11 magnetic azimuth then the true inclination is found hy

14. Obsei·vation.J! of rlip 1>.11 met1n,~ of a loa<lerl nee,lle.-But the best method would seem to be that of l\layer, proposed in 1814, whieh is peculiarly titted for elimi11ati11g the efti .. '.t of an ineg·ulm·it~· iu the figure of the pivots, sirwe tl1e dip can he fonud 011 almost any part of the circnmterence of the axle. 'l'bis method consists iu loading tlie needle (near its axis) aml thus changing its direction. The new position is cornlitione·l by the equilibrium of the magnetic force and tbat, of gr:wit.y. The tilt may amount to 90° or more; and tilwuhl the needle be deflected into the adjacent qrnulrant, the algehrnic sign of the observed dip changes and must he attended to. For want of a 11etter contrivance, a drop of sealing· wax may be applied to the side of the needle near its axle, awl observatiom: may be made with the needle variously deflected by changing its quantity, or b;r ·1etti11g it act at a different leverage. The ordinar,Y rule:,; for observing dip are adhered to, out special care must be taken that the weight be not changtd in position in the act of reversing tlte polarity of the needle. This method of reduction may also be followed if onlinary needles <lifter as much as 30 or 40 in any of their separate results, tiither due to change of face or polarity. Let H1, H11 , H,m H1111 he the observed dips, say, with face of needle B, face VI/ au<l after cha11ge of polarits, with face \Y and face E, respectively, and

Determination of relative total inte1rnity l>y means of the dip-circle, combining deflections /)l/ gmvity a.nd mag1ietism, by Dr. Lloy<l'x methorl.-The more recently eoustructe<l Kew dip-circles are provided, as stated, with a deflector, to be applie(l on the outside of the circle, so that the axe8 of the deflected and deflecting needles are in the same Rtrnii.dit line; with these inRtrnmeut8 relative t-0tal intensity may lie determined with great accnracs li,\· a method" devised by Dr. Lloyd. The method c01Mists of two operations: Br the first a11 ordinary dipping·-11eedle iti (letiected hy another so-called intensity-needle, tlteir axes of rotatio11 being in the ,;ame right liue; uy tl1t· second this intensity-needle, which is l>ro\·iuell with small holes for t lie insertion of certain weights, is deflected by a weight aml thus balanced agaim;t gravit,\'·. B_y a com hiuation of thesce two processes tbe earth's relative total intenl'iit_y can be fonud independent of the change of the 111ag11etic intensity of the needle employed. The temperature of the intensity-needle is snpposed the same during the short time needed to put it through the two operations; if uot, a s111<1ll corrnction will be reqnire<L To convert relative into absolute Yalues observations must also be made at a hase station where the magnetic intensiQ· has been determined in absolute measure b,r means of a magnetometer.

III. ABSOLUTE AND RELATIV.E MEASURES OF THE MAGNETIC PORCE.

17. Un£ts of measure of tile magnetic force.-lt is usual, when accurate results are desired, to measure the horizontal component of the magnetic force by means of fl portable unifilar magnetometer and the dip by means of a dip-circle, and to derfre the total force by combining the$e results. In high magnetic latitudes, where the horizontal componeut is feeble in comparison with the vertical component, Lloyd's statical method, employing· the dip-circle, as already explained, or his improved method by deflectors, are to be preferred. The latter method was employed with complete succe1<s even in the comparatfrely low latitudes of the Gnlf of }Iexico. Ilotli methods give relatiye valnes for the total force. To measure the horizontal force b.r means of the magnetometer two distinct operations are required, known as "Observations of Deflections" and "Observ. ations of Oscillations." Their combinat,ion will enable us to separate, in the observed force, that part which is due t-0 the magnetism of the magnet from the other, which is due to the earth's magnetism. Either of these operations, lmt especially the latter, will determine relati\·e horizontal intensity with great precision; and, when coIUbined or when used in connection with a base station where the magnetic force is known, absolute results will be obtained. In the latter case the observer, after occupying the base station, should return to the same after tlie coIDpletion of his magnetic i;;urvey and again measure the magnetism of his magnet, which, in the interval, must have been carefully guarded against changes; the results must be corrected, if necessary, for loss of mHgnetism. Defiections give a measure of the ratio of the magnetic force of the (deftecting) magnet and that of the earth's horizontal eompon~nt, whereas oscillations (of the imme magnet) furnish a measure of the product of these two forces; hence they may be separated and each may finally be expressed in absolut.e measure. The units for the measure of the earth's magnetic force commonly employed in England and the United States are the second of mean time, the foot (in tbe metric system, the millimetre), and the grain (in the metric system, the milligram). In statical measure the unit of magnetic force is the pressure of a unit mass under the influence of a unit force, which force would produce, if the mass be free to move during one second, a velocity of one unit (and not a velocity g or force of gravity, which iu latitude 450 is equal t-0 32.17 feet, or 9m.So6, so commonl.Y adopted in works on moohauics).. This adopted unit of measure, considered d;ynamically, implies that the unit of accelerative force will produce unit velocity in unit of time. This unit of foree is therefore g times smaller than the unit of gravitation-force. Thus, supposing the horizontal force of the earth'is magnetism to be (in British m1its) 4.36 at Washington in 1877, what is meant is that t11is foree is equal. to a pressure of a mass of 4.36 grains when under the infiuence of an attractive force which would produce during one second a ,-elocity of one foot. The same, if expressed in ordinary units

of gravitation-force, would be . 4 ·3~, or 0.1355 grain of pressure under the earth's attraction.
32.17

'fhe unit of magnetic force in the metric system is 118\ 16 of ordinary gravitation measure; lience in this respect the unit of magnetic force in the British system is to that of the metric syst,em as 9806 : 32.17, or nearly 305 times greater thau the latter. To chauge numerical measures of intensity expressed in units of the metric system into their equi,ralents expressed in C. G. S. or British Association measure, or in units of the centimetre, the gramme, and the second, we have only to shift the decimal point one place to the left. Thus, the horizon ta.I force 4.36, given above for Washing-ton, when expressed in Gau.ssiau or metric units equals 2.010 and in C. G. S. units it becomes o.2orn dyne. The earth's magnetic energy acts upon a magnet as a couple, the attractive force exerted on one half of the magnet being equal and opposite in direction t-0 the repulsive force on the other half.· --------·---·--------·A magnetic pole of unit strength in the C. G. 8. system is one which repels an equal pole at unit distance with
llllit

ti:>ree; that is,

1n

a distance of 1 em. with a force of 1 dyne.

The strength of the two opposite poles of a magnet is equal. The fll01nent of a magnet is it.s length multiplied by the strength of one of its poles, and a unit mor:ient is one of a magnet of unit length with poles of unit strength.

J8. l>c1Jcn'ptfon and use (!f the niagnetometer.-There are two forms of unifilar magnetometers: that with a complete astrouomical theodolite, or alt-azimuth, detached from the box in which the collimator-magnd is suspended, but generally on the xame stand with it; and that whicb has the box with s1rnpernled magnet mounted centrally o,·er, aud firmly connected witl1, an azimuth-circle, the reading tele1;cope being mounted eccentrically on supports. The first form, supposed to have been devised by Gaui;s and ·weber, is the preferable one in field use; it admits of greater expedition, allows of greater ease in ohserdng and is almost indispensitblc when the astronomical meridian has to be dBtcrmiuP~L 'Yitb the magnet to the south of the theodolite, it readily admits of obsernttions of the sun, for the determination of time and azimuth (also of latitude, if required), without interfering with the magnetic work proper. Deflections are read oft' on the scale of the collimator-magnet, aud nmst be COJffcrted into angular measures. Tlle second form,* supposed to have been given by Dr. Lamont, is capable of yielding deflection results of greater accuracy and is better suited for a fixed observatory, especially when declination disturbances also are to be ohsen·ed, a11d at all r;tatiorn; where there is a large dail,\- range in the declination. The angles of deflection arfJ at onee read off. In orde1 to obsenre the azimuth-mark, the magnet and box have temporaril.'- to be removed, which is unnecessary in the first form of the instrument. \Yhen observing dcfiectiom;, tbe har aud consequently the deflecting magnet, remain fixed in the magnetic prinw Yertiml, with the magnetometer with detached theodolite; but in the second form of the instrument as dnised by Lamont the deflecting and deflected magnets alwa.'·s remain at right auglell to each othn.t lmpro,·ements ha,-e been made at tile Coast Snrvey Office in the construction of rnaguetometerr;, with a special view of- making tbern more portable than the older instruments, which were found unnecessarily large and heavy. In r8]I a 3-inch Casella theodolite wa8 utilized for this pm·pose. The nrngnet (3 inches Ioug and ;:{inch in diameter) and light wooden box, with glass tube, were first attached to the upper frame of the theodolite, but afterward to its stand, by wldch greater steatliness was secured. The relative horizontal intensity only could be measured b~- means of oscillations. In October, 1874, a similar instrument was fitted up by the writer, for use in South America, with 2 magnets, mass-ring, aud deflecting bar for absolute measure, the magnets being only about 1_1_; and r }~ inches in length. In the year 1877 several instruments were constructed of the kind known as eornbination instruments, with 4-inch theodolites and magnets, i.50 and 1.8.4 inehes in length, respectivel,y; diami~ter, 0.3 inch. One of these 'instruments is presented in the accompanying plate, No. 36. The upper part of the theodolite can be remm·ed aud the magnet-box placed on its azimuth-circle. The operations for either construction of the instrument are essentially the same and the simple modifications necessary in using one or the other form iu observing and computing will be specially noted under the appropriate heads of the work. \Vhen obserYing for time and for duration of oscillations, a mean-time box-chronometer is most com-enient for use; the observer will himself take up the beat (lialf secon<l) and estimate fractions of seconds. For a tra\·eler, who dislikes to be much iucumbered, a pocket-chronometer is much to be preferred, but the counting of the beats, generally five in two seconds~ requires some previous practice. It is recommended to take up aueven beat-say at o, 10, 20, 30, &c., secondsaud count only the cYen beats, repeating the letters a b c d in the intervals; thus, 1 o a b c d, r 2 a b c r7, q a, &c. The letters are afterward converted into their equivalents of time; thus, 14 c woald he 15·.z 19. Ohscn:a#ons of <lejlections.-Tbe instrument being adjusted as for observations of declinatimi, attaeh the deflecting bar, snspend the shorter of t,he two magnets as generally supplied for each instrument; the liue of detorsion having been placed in the magnetic meridian, insert the copper damper, raise the suspended magnet to the horizontal level of the deflecting (or long) magnet, put

In ohserdng with the magnetometer and attached themlolite, we may sayc tinw by noting the two extreme scale-readings of an oscillation, instead of waiting for the magnet to come to rest; a1H l in Form 2, we can also reduce the time of observation hy setting the azimuth-circle beforehand nearly to the rea<ling corresponding to the particular position of the magnet and aft.erw~trd perfecting the tlointing on the middle di\'ision by the azimuth or slow motion-screw. The scale of the deflect· iug bar~ should be examined for graduation and eccentricit;y errors and corrected for them if necessary.

These two operations should, therefore, always immediately follow eacli other. 20.

of the mag·net is put inside the box, the stem pr~jecting outside. The mean-time chronometer,§ whose rate must be known, is placed at a safe distance below the telescope, allowing, however, the obserrnr to take up the time, t'.. e., pick up the beat, without changing bis place. \Yith the magnet at rest, the n·rtical thread of the telescope should point nearly to the reading 011 the scale of the magnetic axis, or to the ceuter dh-ision. Care must be taken that the magnet have· no up aud down ,-ibrations; a horizontal motion is then gi,·eu to it by means.of a small magnetized piece of steel, sufficient to make it oscillate for abont twenty or twenty.ffre minutes before cmming to rest. The oscillations are counted as follows: Suppose the center division of the scale to pass from apparent right to left, call its first transit over the line of collimation of the telescope o, and note the time (the minute hadng previom;ly beeu noted, the second is added without taking the eye off the telescope); its next transit will be from left to right and is called r, the next following one from right to left is called 2, and so on until the tenth transit is observed, when the time iR again noted~ for which purpose the beat of the chronometer has to be taken up in the usual manner. The dnration of ten oscillations being thus approximately known, the intervals and whole number of oscillations to be obserrncl can be properly arranged. With the light magnets uow ill use, two fibers and for those used in eonnectiou with 3-inch Casella theodolites, even a single tiller suffices for the s11spensiou. The best arrangement yet dedsed for ordinaril~' observing oscillations is the following: Begin with apparent motion of the magnet, say, from right to left, and note for a certain number of oscillations the times of, say, three transits; then take an equal number from left to right, to be followed, after au interral of a few minutes (of rest to the observer), in order to get the duration for, say, one hundred oscillations, by a similar set of transits from right to left; and conclude finally witli an equal number of transits from left to right. It will be noticed that for eYen nnmbers of oscilbtio11s the apparent motion is from right to left, for odd numbers the reYerse. \\" e tlnrn pro\'ide experimentally for any effect of a cLange in the declination during the observations, tlie final mean duration of one oscillation being unaffected by any such change. It is advisable not to extend the entire time co11snmed in a set of observations beyond a quarter of an l1our and to make the interval between any two consecuth-p observations (tl1e magnet swinging again in the same direction) betweeu one-third and two.thirds of a minute. This gives ample time to take up the heat of the chronometer, which is done, say, ten seconds before the expected time of transit i11 order to await it deliberately. The arrangement fur a particular case is shown in the form given below; here the three intervals (rough ones only) of 39", 43· and 3m 12" are known beforehand and mur;t he mentall,v added to the observed time in order to be prepared for the next following tra.nsits. ".itlt the time of a transit only roughly known, the observer will not be bir~sed in his estimation of the obser,-e<l fraction of a secoud. I·'or each particular magnet, depending mainly on its mass and 11rng1wtic intensity, a special sche:ue must be dm,isecl, guided by the principles as explained above; but the same seheme may be adl1ered to for a number of stations, unless the sur\·e;r extends over a spaee within the limits of whieh the earth's horizontal force has widely· different values. Special atte11tion is to he paid to the correct noting of the tem11erature and the observations must be accompanied hy measures of the torsion. The correction for induction may be omitted except whengreat accuracy is demanded; it ariises from the fact of the magnet having greater force, by iudnction, when suspended in the magnetic meridian, than in the positionat right anirles to it (as in deflections). On the suhject of induction, see Coast Sun-ey Report of 1869, Appendix No. 9.

I1et H=the horizontal component of tlre earU1's maguetic force; m=the magnetic moment of the intensity-magnet; l\I=its moment of mass (inclusive of stirrnp and balancing ring,t if any) ; T=the time of one oscillation; then, from ouservations of oscillations, we have the expression for the product
where n:= 3.14159 The observations of deflections give the ratio-i and the observations of oscillations the product m H; m and R can therefore be eliminated from the two equations, as shown in the precediug example. To determine M, a trul.v-turued brasl:l or bronze ring of known dimensions and weight (about equal to that of the magnet) is place<l on the magnet. It is correctly centered by means of two wooden centering-blocks and when snHpernled must remain in a horizontal position. The number of suspension fibers must be doubled for the purpose. In this position a set of oscillations is observed similar in arrangement to that already explained; and if T 1 be the time of one oscillation of the loaded magnet, and M 1 the moment of mass of the ring, then

A series of not less than thirteen consecutive sets of observations of oscillations, with the magnet alternately unloa<led and loaded, is to be made, each set duly corrected for torsion, rate of chronometer and difference of temperature, from which t.he value of M is deduced. These results are to be combined with a view of eliminating tl1e effect of changes in 1f during the observations; thus the mean of setN 1 and 3 is used with set 2, the mean of 3 and with 41 &c.1 the firs~ and last sets

In reducing temperature of ring to standard temperature, it suffices to assume the ordinary coefficient of expansion for brass or bronze .0000105 for Fah., or .0000189 for the Centigrade scale. The values of log 7!2 M should be tabulated for different temperatures; we have

where for hard-tempered steel e=.0000068 Fah., or .0000122 for Centigrade scale. The reduction of the time of an oscillation to an infinit:esimal arc is generally so smnll as not to affect the magnetic results.

This correction can be avoided b~· swinging oruy through small arcs. 2r. Con·ection for inequality of temperatnre.-ln general, when the temperature of a magnet rises there is a corresponding weakening of its effectfre magnetism an<l when its temperature falls there is an increase of magnetism. To reduce the measure1.o1 of deflections and oscillations to tlle same temperature, let t = the temperature of the magnet when deflecting; t 1 = its temperature when oscillating; q=the change in magnetic moment of magnet for a change in temperature of 10 Fahrenheit, then the coefficient to be applied to T' to reduce to tmuperature of deflections is equal to 1 -(t' - t) q, as shown in the example. The value of q is not constant, bnt, for a moderate range of temperature, may be taken as constant; it must be obtained experimentally, either from oscillations or from deflections, at various temperatures, bnt the magnet should not be subjected to a greater range of temperature than from about 32° to 1000 Fahrenheit. These observations must be conducted by the alternate use of a jacket of ice and of' hot water, or b,v the aid of extreme natural temperatures; ample time must, however, he given to Urn magnet to establish again an equilibrium in its magnetism; all rapid changes from cold to hot (or vice versa) will give decidedly erroneous values for q. Supposing not less than three consecutive series of observations of deflections for finding a value of q and the first and third series to be at nearly the same temperature, with their results combined to a mean, and the second or intermediate series at a greatly different temperature, then q may be found, with sufficient precision, by the expression

.q=a nootu

t- to

where a= the arc value of one division of the scale of the suspended magnet in terms of the radius; n =the difference of scale-readings corresponding to the difference of temperature t - t0 ; and u =angle of deflection at the lower temperature to. In every case the arrangement must be such as to eliminate, as far as possible, any effects of changes in lleclination and intensity during the observations. If other instruments are available, it is best to correct the readings for observed changes in declination and intensity.

rory, were included between the limits .00076 and .00004 The value given in the text is about an average one. 'l'he coefficient depends mainly on the hardness of the steel. [See Proc. Roy. Soc. No. 181, May, 1877.] If the magnetic moment 'tn of the nrngnet has been determined at a number of stations, the different values may be reduced t;o a st.audard temperature. Let mo= magnetic moment at the standard temperature t 0 ; m =the magnetic moment at any other temperature t, then mo= m [l + (t - t0) q] If the values of m0 are arranged according to time, the gradual loss of magnetism will beeouw apparent in a few weeks, unless the magnet be an oltl one, when yearly determinations of in will indicate but a slight loss. A new magnet is not well suited for intensity-determinations until after the lapse of two or three months. 22. Introduction of absolute for relative vafoes of tltc horizontal force a.s determined by oscillations alone.-For this purpose we require oscillations at a base station, usually a permanent magnetic observatory, where the value of H in absolute measure is known or has been determiued hy means of the magnetometer. These oscillations should be taken just before setting out and again imme diately after the return from a magnetic sur··ey, in order that a proper allowance be made for loss of magnetism of the oscillating magnet during the interval. Let H and T be the horizontal force in ahsolnte measure and the obsenTed time, in seconds, of an oscillation respectively, at the base station; H 1 and T 1 similar quantities at any other station, then T2 H1=Ti2H and it should be observed that all oscillatio11s are supposed referred to a standard temperature, say 590 Fah., or 150 C. The values of T2H for the first (e1 ) and gecond (llz) epochs are kuowu aud their mean is taken to answer for the middle time eo= Yz (e1 +e.2), also their difference L'., which, divided by the difference e2 -ei, expressed, say, in days, gives the effect of the daily loss of magnetism of the magnet. For any time, e we can easily find by interpolation the proper value of T'H by applying the effect for the interval e-e0 as shown in the following example. · To rellnce obsermtious of oscillationR made at any temperature, t t-0 the adopted standard temperature til we have for the corrected value of T'

where q=change in magnetic moment of magnet for a change in temperature of 10 Fah. (or C.). Suppose, for example, that August n, 1871, the logarithm of T' was found to equal 1.18018 at the temperature of 650 Fah., and that the adopted normal t,emperature is 6oO Rah. aud the value.of q=.00031, then l-(t-to)q=o.99845 and its logarithm 9.99933, which added to log T' gives the corrected value of log T'=i.17951 Example:

The difference in log H for e1 and Cot is due t;o effect of secular change. We have e,-e1=592

Ooncludin,g remarks.-The degree of accuracy attainable in the magnetic measures can only be estimated; it will depend not only on the construction of the instruments used, but greatly on the time spent on the measures, chiefly on a.econnt of the almost incessant changes in the action of terrestrial magnetism: With well-constructed instruments, such as have been supposed in this

TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM-COLLECTION OF RESTJLT8 FOR DECLINATION, DIP AND INTENSITY, FRO~I OBSERVATIONS l\IADE BY THE UNITED STATES COAST AND UEODETIC RURVEY BETWEEN 1S.H AND 1882, JULY.
By CHARLES A. SCHOTT, Assistant.

CCOil'UTING DIVISION, June 30, 1882. During the progress of the operations of tlrn Surn>,y from 1844 to the present time, there ham hmm presented from time to time in the annual reports a m1111 her of fragmentary 1mlllicatio11s of magnetic results depending on the obserYations accumulated; principal among these are the 11apers gi,Ten in Appendix No. 43, Iteport for 1854, and Appendix No. 47, l{,eport for 1855. The.r coi1tai11 declination results exclusi\Tely, the former at 136, the latter at 153 stations. The only collection of magnetic results complete to date of publication is that contained iu the Report for 1856, Appendix No. 28 (pp. 215-221 ). It comprises declinations, dips and intensity measures at l 57 stations. This publication was supplemented in the Heport for 1858, Appendix No. 24, which bring8 up the number of stations to 185; and again in Heport for 1860, Appendix No. 28, which terminates wit.h Station No. 204. After this 1late no general publication of magndic rPfmlts wa8 attem1ited, only some partial or special resnlts ht>i11g girn11. After 80 long an iutt>rrnl, a111l 1YitJ1 the rapid den~lop ment and spread of the magnetic operations of the Coa,;t r1ml Gernletic SurYey since 1878 into and over the interior of the country, thus filling up gaps which, for the study of the dh1trilmtion of magnetism needed most att.cutiou, it appeared higl1ly tlesirablc to bring before the public a complete collection of all the results of the SurYey so far obtained. This ha" now been done in a systematic and concise form and aft.er the indh-idual result.shad undergone redsion. The total uumber of stations for whieh results arc giYen is 638. Before the year 1844 we find but a few declination8 recorded, though Huperintendent F. R Hassler intended to introduce the measure of the magnetic declination and relatirn i11temiity into the regular operations of the Survey aml describes and figures his azimuth-compass (pattern of 1 Sor) in th fl Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (vol. ii, new series, Philadelphia, 1825, pp. 354-356) under the title, '' Pitpers on various snl~ject8 connected with the survey of the coast of the United Stat{~s," communicatkid :\farch 3, 1820. For relati,·e intensity he i1roposed the method of o8cillations, for which he had provided himself with a special needle. This was the onl,\· method theu kuow11;" lmt it was useless for the nwasurc of t11e l'i('Cnlar change of the. intensity. The interest in terrestrial magnetism recefred a great impetus after n,rnss had 8hown, in 1833, how the intensity of the earth's magnetic force could be expressed in ahsolute measme; aml the observations for intensity multiplied -greatly after Weber, in 1836, Juul produced the portable magnetometer, to be used in connection with Gauss' theory. The magnetournter came into use in the Survey in 1844; dipt and intensitj' measures were introduced in the Surve;y by Superintendent A. D. Bache in 1844, since which time the magnetic observations have made steady progress. All observations were made on land. Respecting the construction and use of the magnetic instruments, the reader may be referred to preceding Appendix (No. 8), entitled, "Directions for Measurement of Terrestrial Magnetism,"
-----·--------

first observations showing a difference of intensity of the earth's magnetic total force, as shown by oscillations of t.he dipping-needle in the plane of the magnetic meridian, appear to have been made by Lamanon between 17~5 and 1787. These were followed 1111 hy de Rossel (.1791-'94), am1 A. v. Humboltlt (1798-18o3). This coarse method was changed into another, a<lmitting of great accuracy, by Hausteen, who substituted the horizontal for tho vertical needle, and snRpending it by a silk fiber, measured relat.ive horizontal force; he was followed hy Duperrey ( 1822-'25) and others. The method, supplemented by absolute measurn at, the base station, is frequently used in the Coast and

~The

Gilodetic Survey. t All the earlier dip-circles had their needles mounted in the plane of the circle; the later and improved instru ments have graduated circles in front of the needle, read by means of microeoopes.

RXPLA~ATION

OF THE '!'ABLES OF MAGNJl;TIC RESULTS.

The tables are arranged by States and Territories in alphabetical order and end with a table headed "l<'oreigu countries." For each State or Territory the results are given in chronological or!ler, divided into sixteen colnm11s, containing the following information: Column 1 gfre,., the running number of stations, not counted again wlwn reoccupicii; a blank spacn in this column therefore indicates that the station has been occupied before, either once or scYcral times. Column 2 contains the name of the station or of the locality. Columns 3 and 4 contain the geographical latitude and longitude of the station, according to the hest information at present available. Columns 5 and 6 give the date, year, month and day of the obserrnLious for declination. Column 7 contains the resulting magnetic declination, + when the north-seeking end of the magnet (or its marked end) is u~est of the true meridian and - when east of it. Colnmn 8 girns the (late (rear as in eolumn 5), month and day of the obscl'Vations for dip. Column 9 contains tlw resulting magnetic dip, + when the north.seeking end is depressed l1t·Jow the horizon and - when eWMted above it. Column 10 gives the date (year as in column 5), month and day of the observations for horizontal comp011Pnt and for total mag·netic forc('.

CHAPTER I.

THE THEORY OF BAROMETRIC HYPSOM:ETRY.
1. The barometric formula for the determination of altitudes given by Laplace, although a great improYement upon all that Lad preceded it, was not entirely pcrfoct. The vapor correction, included in the temperature correction by means of a modification of the constant in the latter, is only an approximate one, which, in cases of an extremely dry or an extremely moist atmosphere, and in all cases wllen the temperatum is near or below zero of the centigrade thermometer, is erroneous, and this imperfection may at times gin ri:w to considerable error. In the time of Laplace, also, the relatiYe ueusities of mercury and of atmospheric air were not sufficiently well known to determ~ne the priucipal coustant in the barometrical formula, and it was therefore necessary to resort to another method of determini11g- it. This was d01w hy Ramoll(l hy ailopting the constant which gave the best agreemeut8 between the altitude~ gi n·1t IJy the formula and those obtained hy trigonometry. Bnt the immbcr of obserrntion;;; and of comparisons ~was so small, and the temperature correction an<l its annual and <linrual variations were so imperfectly understood then, that the constant which he obtained, and which has been mostly used ever since, was erroneous, except for the summer season and a Pertain hour of t!Je da~-, and is not correct, as it should be, for mean annual and diurnal temperatures. After the accurate experiments of Regnault, by which the relative densities of mercury arnl the atmosphere became better known, and numerous comparisons of the altitudes given by the formula with those obtained by mt-ans of the spirit level, it is now known that the constant ohtainc1l b~· Ramo11d for Laplace's formula is too small. The constant derived from tlle results of Hegnanlt's experiments cannot be much in error; but still it would be well to ha Ye its accuracy corroborated by many more compariso11s of altitudes given by it with those obtained directly h~· me:tnH of the spirit-leYel. But this cau only be done where the differeuee of level of two statfons near to each other arnl'differing considerab!y in altitude has been accurately ascertained, and where the neces:'lary meteorological observations have been made at the two stations. The greatest uncertainty in barometric hypsometry arises from the imperfection of the temperature correction. In determining the difference of altitude between two stations from obserYations made at all seasons of the year and hours of the da~-, it is found that the results vary very much with the seasons of the year and hours of the day, the differences of altitude obtained being generally too great for the wannest season of the year and tl1e warmest part of the day, anti the reverse Jor the coldest season of the year and part of the tlay. This was first noted by I{amond, and has been confirmed b.v all subseq~tent investigators of the subject. It is now well known that these discrepancies arise from the erroneous assumption that the average temperature of the ail' S. Ex. 49-29

column, upon which the difference of pressure between the two stations depends, is the average of the observed temperatures of these stationR. .Much has been done b;v Plantamour and lWhlman· in Europe, and hy Williamson t and \Yhitne:vt here, in inYestigating and explaining these discrepancies; but much more is still required in this direction. Since the time of Laplace the barometric formula has been put into a great Tariet;r of forms, without, however, any great improvement in the convenience of its practical applications, but the vapor correction has been introduced more accurately, and the principal constant has been improved. Since Mie labors of Plantamour and Bauerufiend, and especially of Riihlmau, in this direction, there is little room left for any improvement of the mere sha.pe of the formula or of any of the constants contained in it. The consideration of barometric gradients, in connection with this subject, is somewhat recent, and they have never been taken into account in an;y regular treatise on barometric hypsometry. It is, howeYer, pretty well under8tood now that allowance must be made in some way for the effect of these gradients where there is a considerable horizontal distance het1rnen the lower and upper stations. It is this part of the subject which especially needs yet further theoretical consideration before corrections for these gradients can be accurately introduced in practical applications of the formula. 2. Barometric hypsometry naturally follows as a regular part of the preceding researches, being based upon the same general principles and equations. From the development of the three small equations (1), Part I, of these researches, with the subsequent addition of a friction term, we have deduced the equations of the general motions of the atmosphere, and of '\Yf\]ones, tornados, waterspouts, &c., and from this same development we get the equations showing the relation between the differences of altitudes and barometric pressures of any two stations, so that it is not necessary here to go back to first principles to obtain the fundamental equations of barometric hypsometry. The method adopted at the outset in the preceding researches is completely exhaustive, leaving it entirely impossible for any effect to escape consideration, and hence our equations throughout contain numerous terms, including those showing the effects of the earth's rotation, which had never been taken into account in such investigations. .Accordingly our fundamental equations in this branch of the su~ject, being deduced from the same development, contain likewise many terms, the effects of which have never been consi<lered, aud the consideration of which im·olves the whole subject of barometric gradients. Some of the small terms which, after close examination, were omitted in the theory of the general motions of the winds, ancl of cyclones, tornados, &c., as being too small to 11ave an;y sensible effect under any circumstances, are retained in the equations of this part of the researches, not so much because they are regarded as being of importance, as to show hat even here tlreir effects are so small that they mig·ht have been neglected. From equations (12), Part I, by supplying the omitted terms D,2 h and FA in the first of these equations, we get

This is the complete fundamental equation of barometric hypsometry as deduced from the developments in the first part of these researches. It differs from the usual equation in containing in addition the term o, whicll, it is seen from its expression, contains the effects of the motions and inertia of the atmosphere togetlter with the effects of the earth'R rotation, while the usual equation applies only to a state of static equilibrium of the atmospltere. From (10) and (20), Part I, accenting g in the latter to indicate its Yalue at sea-leYel and on the parallel of 450 7 and putting a=273°, we get

in which, it will be remembered, l is the lieight of a homogeneous dry atmosphere on the parallel of 45°, with a temperature t=O. 3. Since the rectangular co-ordinates Ji, u, and v in the last number of (1) are entirely independent of one another, the differential elements in the integration, say by mechanical quadratures, can be so taken as to extend the integration from the lower to the upper station b~' any line whatever, and since in a fluid the pressure is alwa;rs the same in all directions, we must in every case arrive at the same result. But as friction, which enters int() the expression of o (2), is an uncertain element of which it is not possible to take account where there are surface currents, it is best to take that line which avoids it as much as possible. I~or instance, if it were required t,o dct-0rmine the difference of altitude between the two stations A and B, J!'ig. (1), the integration of the second member of (1) might be carried from A to B along some line near the surface of the mountain, or it might be extended vertically from A to C, on a level with B, and then horizontally from C to B.

In the former case it would be necessar~' to take into account the temperature, or value of t, and also of e, in the expression of a(:3), and likewise the friction F, all of which enter into the integral of the secoud member of (1 ), but in the latter case it would be uecessary to haYe the values oft and e in the vertical line AC only, since both these in the line BC could be regarded as being constant and having the same value a1< at C, except. very near the station B, where this line comes to the surface of the earth. The Yalue of the friction term F in the first term of the expression of o (2), which is that in the direction of the nrtieal line AC, would be entirely insensible unless there were a local and very rapidly ascendiug or desce1Hling· current, and on the; line CB it would be very small, since there is little friction except near the earth's ;mrface. On the part of o arising from the integration from C to H wonld d1~pmHl the barometric gradient at the level of the upper station, and a woul_d be equal O, where there is uo gradient. The temperature along any line near the surface of the mountain would be better known if we had obsel'\'atious at a nmnurr of interveni11g- stations than that on the vertical line AC, and even the mean of the two extremes would generally give an average which would be more correct for a · line from A to B near the surface thau for the vertical line AU. Ilut as the effect of friction cannot be taken into account, an<l may be large on the line from A to B near the surface, it is best to obtain the temperatnre, as nearly as can he, on the line AC Vl'rtical over the lower station, which ma~- be very different from the temperature ou tlrn same level at the surface of the mountain. During the warmest part of the day, especially in the summer season and in clear weather, the air near the surface of rnou11tai11 sides hecome;; much more heated than it tloes at other places on the same level and at a considerable altitude ahoYe the surface, and tlien, it is well known, there are generally strong currents of' air along the surface tom~rd aml up the side of the mountain, and the friction terms in tlie expression of o become large. In this case the temperature is greater and com;eqnently the pres;;ure of the air columu less, but this is exactly counteracted by the friction of the current up the side of the mountain, for relittivc lightness of the air near the surface gives rise to the ascending current. which is· accelerated until the friction exactly counteracts the force which produces the current, after which the current remains uniform as long as the temperature and force giving rise to the current remain the same. This excess of' temperature, the11, near the surface, above that of the air generally at the same level, should not be used unless we could also take into account the equal and counteracting effect of the friction arising from the currents produced b;y this excess of temperature. Early in the morning, espeeially in the winter season and in clear weather, the reverse takes place and the currents are down and from the mountain side. In this case we also have the effect of the friction terms depe11ding upon this current, but their signs are reversed and their effect exactly counteracts that of the increased pressure of the air column arising from dimiuished temperature. It is well known to hunters, aud all who Lave encamped at night on mountain sides in clear weather, that the current is generall~- downward during the night, and hence it is usual to imt the fires on the lower side of the camp so as to avoid the smoke. Of' course, these ascending and descending currents of mountain sides are observable mostly in calm weather, when they are not interfered with, or completely reversed, by the other more general currents of the atmosphere. 4. Neglecting for the present tlie first term in the expression of a (2), which in all practical applications will be Rhown to he insensible, if we snppos1\ the integrations in the second member of (1) to be carried from the lower station A, Fig. (1), up vertically to the height of the upper station C, and then horizontally to B, we shall have

in which the integral must be taken as defined in § 2, and the values of t and e in the expresRion of a (3) must be those belonging to the vertical line over the lower station. The value of o may be regarded as being independent of h, since we cau neglect the first term in the expression (2), and will depend upon the motions, inertia, &c.i of the air at the level of the upper station. It is seen that the value of a becomes a small correction to log P, depending upon the gradient, of pressure, and if we put 6 =to the increase of pressure in the direction of the upper station from the lower, arising from the gradient depending upon o,

If the true temperntnres in the vertical were known in thi1' case, this expre8sion would still contain 6, a quantity which bas different \"alues at diffel'ent altitudes, and hai> 110 accurate and known relation to its value at sea-Im-el or the plane of the lower station, so that if even its valne were known at sea-level or the lower station, there would still he considerable unccrtaint;y with regard to its value above. The various conditions to he safo;fied, both in fhe general motions of the atmosphere and in those of c,yelones and tornadoes, often require the horizoutal motions to vary considerably in difierent altitudes, and hence the value of o, and the corresponding \·alue of 6, must be different at different altitudeo;_ If we suppose the mountain upon which the nprier station iR placed to be removed and its place to be occupied by air, the barometric and temperature gradients whicll would exist iu this case could be determined, at least approximatel,Y, l1y those of the air surrounding the mountains. This might he done in any special case by means of simultaueous barometric or temperature observations at several stations around the mountain, or eYen only two l'tations, if these were in the line connecting the two stations, and not so far apart that the gradients would change seusibly in the inten-ening space. For annual and rnonthl,r aYeniges of barometric and temperature obsen-ations, very accurate charts of barometric and temperature gradients for each month and for the year might be prepare1l for any country wher1i the llf'CeRsary ohsen·ations are at hand, and tl1en from these chart;;; the differences of presRnre between the two stations at tl1f' lm·el of tlu~ lower, and also the differences of tern1lerature, could be obtained wllercnr ohserrntions were made for hypsometrical purposes. If in the preceding exp1'ession we suppose the inte!-,rrations to lie carried from the lower station A, Fig. (1 ), along the horizontal line on the leYel of that station to the Yertical of the upper sLation and then along that Yertical to B, we shall have, by putting 6 ' for the value of 6 at this level,

In thiR case the value of 6 1 can be more readily obtained than 6 in the former, and the temperature at D can be obtained from the observed temperature at A, I~ig.

There would, l10w· ever, be in tl1is case the same uncertainty with regard to the temperature at the upper station since we would need tlie temperature which the air woulll have, were the mountain with its abnor· mally heated or cooled surface removed.

in which s is the velocity of vertical rnotiou, s' being the value of s at the assumed origin of the integration. If this is the surface of the earth we necessarily haves' =0. l<'rom this expression it is seeu that o is positiYe in the case of accelerated ascending currents, and hence the differenct· between l" awl P, as is seeu from (1), is increased in such cunents by the reaction of the inertia. It must not be supposed, howm'er, that the prmisure at the earth's surface urnler imch an aiscending current is greater tlian at surrounding places, for there cannot be an ascending current unless the air of the current is lighter from some cause than that of the surrounding parts, and tl1e diminution of pressure from this cause is exactly equal to the reaction of the accelerated velocity wbicl1 it gives rise to. In the case of friction the pressure must be a little less at the base of the ascemling current, since a part of the force which overcomes the inertia of the accelerated ascending current is spent in overcoming the friction of the surface currents below, which arc ncceEsary to supplj· the draught of the ascending cnrrent. Si11ce the expression of 6 i11 this case depe11ds upon s', tlle result is the same for either ascending or descending currents, sinee i11 botli cases we must have 8 1 =0 at tlie earth's surface. The dhect action, therefore, of the retarded descernling current is exactly equal to the reaction of the erJlially accelerated Yelocity of tl1e ascending current. But there cauuot be a descending current u11Iess from some cause the air of thi;,; current i-; l1ea\·ier than that of tlie surrounding parts, aud hence in thi;,; case the pressure on the earth's surface is increatied from both causes. The effect of accelerated or retarded ascending or descending currents upon the pressure at the earth's surface, or any assumed lm'el at which s=s', is giYen by (9), in which 6 is giYen by (12), and the yalue of P must be that of P', corresponding to tlie leYel where S=s'. This effect is in all ordinar;y cases exceedingly small. If we suppose the velocity at any height to he s=lOm per second, the value of o in (12), supposing tlie lower station to he on the earth's snrface where s' =0 and that the temperature i=O, wonld he 7 -:1;,., and multiplying this into 76()mm, supposing tliis to be the barometric pressure at the earth's surface, we get hy (11) 6 =0.96mm, or less than one millimeter in this extrPnw case. ·with a Yalne s=5m"' at thr upper statiou the effect would be onlj· o.24mro, In aU cases, therefore, in which observations are made for hypsometrical purposes the effects of vertical currents are insernsible. \Vhere a column of air is ascending or descending without any change of velocit;y, or where it is first accelerated and then re'tarded, or rice u;rsn, so that we still have S=s', it is seen that it does not affect tlie difference of pressure between the two stations, since in such cases we have by (12) 0=0.

In the last very small term of this expression, only the term depending upon the temperature in the last of (14) has been taken into account. If we neglect the part of this term depending upon c', we have the expression'of H in the caRe in which the t.emperature and value of e decrease in proportion tD the increase of altitude, for when thiR is the case c' 1 and c' 2 in (16) vanish, and hence, from the last of (17), c'=O.

B.v the preceding more general ancl rigorous method the last term of (19) is added to the usual formula. This term, however, is usually very small, and may be neglected unless either c' is very large, or the va.lue of t'-t, which may occur in the latter if t_!1e dift'erence of altitude of tl1e two stations is

great. Where the value of c' is so great in comparison with that of c that the expression of H in (18) is not sufficiently convergent to make the neglected terms below the third order sufficiently small to be neglectefl, the last term in (19) does not represent accurately the effect of the term in (18) depending upon c', since the neglected terms may be large in comparison with those retained of the third order. Considering only the term in tlw expression of x in (14) depending upon t, since the others are generally very small in comparison, we get from (17) and (20) (21)
If, now, we put in the first of (16) c1 =.005°, which is its value if the temperature decreases 0.5° for each 100 meters of increase of altitude, we get c\ =.0000000458. With this value of c' 1 the last term of the first of (Hl) gives, if we put II =2000 meters, c1 Il 2 =00.1s. Hence the usual formula requires a decrease of temperature very nearly proportional to the increase of altitude, but not strictly so. 7. Since gravity differs with a change of elevation, the barometer does not give the absolute pressure of the air in measures of an invariable unit. It is evident from an inspection of the formula (19) that this unit may be that of any assumed altitude, and hence it is only necessary to reduce tl1e measure at the one station to that of the unit of measure belonging to gravity at the other. I1ct R' and B be the observed 11eghts of the barometer at the lower and upper· stations, respectively, corresponding to the absolute pressures P' and P measured by a barometer acted upon by an nnchauged force of g-ravity. \Ve slrnll then have, since the measures given directly by the barometer vary inversel,y, as the force of gravity,

Where these vary as the first power of JI we have r:'=O iu the expression of O. 8. The effect supJ)()Sed t-0 be due to the attraction of the strata of the earth between tbe upper station and the level of the lower station, introduced into the formula by Utihlmau, has been neglected here. This was introduced by him upon the hypothesis that these strata are so muCh additional attracting miittcr coming between the upper station and the earth's center, and that consequeutly the attraction at the upper station, as at B (Fig. 1), is greater than at C on the 2ame level in open space vertically over the lower station. From theoretical considerations alone

it is not probable that there has been much increase of rnaUer lietweeu the upper station and tlw earth's center from the formatjon of (·ontiuents, table lands, arnl mountain ranges, and 11ence there is little increase of attraction at the upper stati011 from this cause~ for the bringing of a part of the attracting strata, a little ueart'r tbe attracte<l lJod~· l1a8 a nry little dl'ect, 11nles8 it is hro11gt1t from a great distance beneath.

'l'lieorics ma,,· differ with regard to the manner in which continents and mountain ra11ges bani hcc11 formed, hnt they most probably orig· iuate<l in 80llte way from the gradtrnl cooli11g a11d coutractiug of the i11terior part of the earth, lmwing the external strata too large for tlie iuterior, from whid1 cam;e they were forced up to a higher level at some partH of tlrn surfam:, with little lateral transfer of matter, lt·a1·i11g the parts below Jess dense and the amount of attraction ou :my point ah0\·1' ilicu1 lJut little increasetl. The sea origi1mlly, either as vapor or water~ must han· been eijually distrilmted ornr ull pa.rts of tlle earth's surface. The eltwatfon of contiueuLs allll mo1mtain masses aho,-e the general lC\-el of tltc bottom of the sea, displaced that part oi' the :>ea which orig-iually t'xiste<l where the continents now are, aud increased the amonut of matter where the r;ea uow is: and hence from this cause there has lJeen a decrease in the amount of attL·actio11 on·r the contium1ts· a111l au iucrease oyer tlie sea. There is also mneh plausilJility iu Archdeacon Pratt's theory that the iuequalities of the earth's surface, as seen in the ruom1tains, plains, and ocean beds, l.t~ffe aril'>eu from unequal rateR of cooling and contraction, they being supposed to he greater in tlw parts covered by the ocean than under the continents, and hence the continents so formed would 11ot imply au increase of matter. But there is another theoretical consideration which must be l'Pgarlif'd a,.; completely dedsin' of the 'Jnestion of the inferior density of the earth's errn;t, where the continents are, iu compari8on with that of the part covered b,r the oct>an. Tile whole glolie <'all he so di\'i<lt·d into two ht'misphereR that nearly all the land is contained i11 the one, and 11early all tlie ocean in the otlit-r. If t!Je continents antl the parts of' the earth's crus.t nuder them had the .same density as the umlistnrlled strata nuder tllC' ocean, the center of gra \'it;y of the earth would occupy the center of the mass, and the ocean would be <lrawu m-er to the sidti where the coutiuents mo,,tly exist, and lean~ some part,s now covered hy the ocean as dry land. There cannot, therefore, he much increase of matter in the parts of the earth's crust where the continents exist. 9. The preceding deductions from merely tbeoretical considerations are complete]~· confirmed by numerous pendulum obsen-ations made over nearly all parts of the globe. If we examine the discussiom; of these obsen'ations in tbe determinations of the figurP of the earth by Airy, Bowditch, aml quite recently by Clarke,* it is seen that the re8iduals mostly indicate diminished gra,·it~· on the continents, especially for elevated Htatious, and increased graYity on small islarnls in tlw ocean. It is not to be supposed, however, from this that there is really less matter wl1ere th<' continent:-; are, for these residuals arise mostl.r from the reductions of gTa\-i(Y fo sea-lenl upon the hypothesis of an increase of matter equal to the mass of the continents aborn sea-len~I. 'l'hc reimlts show that if these reductions were omitted, as they should be aceording to the prece·ling view of' the matter, the residuals would nearly disappear. Tbis is especiall,Y seen in t11e geodetic operations of India, in which, as the Himalayas are approached, the penclulnm ohsen-ations of the ele,-ated stations, with the usual reductions to sea-le\-el, indicate a great deficiencs of gravity. ·with regard to this Uolonel Clarke says: "Kaliana was fixed on by Sir G. Everest as the nearest approach to the base of the Himalayas for reliable geodetic observations, aud in our tables we see that at that station and all north of it there is a large defect of graYity, attaiu~11g at l\fore a11 amount of-2:! Yibrations. It is very remarkable that this is precisely tl1e amount of the correction tbat had betm applied for the attraction of the mountains, so tlrnt the"apparnnt Yertical attraction of the three miles of earth crust between Mor~ and sea-level is zero. And, in facti at most of the other high stations the residual discrepancy is dimiuished or removed if we omit the corrections for the attraction of the table laud lying between the station and the sca-levcl."t

From cornpatisons recentl,r made hy Dr. Carl Koppe, in Zlirich, and also by Herr Billwiller, between hair hygromet0rs and the psyclnometer, at temperatures below the freezing point, it is evident that this part of the formula. is Ycry erroneous.

If the formula entirely fails for ,·er.r low percentages of humidity, it mast begin to be inaccurate where the percentage of humidity is not yery small. .As the numerical coefficient, however, int.he formula was determined empirically so as to satisfy observation and experiment for ordinary ranges of humidity, the formula for these is sufficiently accurate. Instead of a formula for giving directly the vapor tension, Mr. Glaisber gives a formula of the form (31) t2 =t-F (t-ti) for determining the temperature of the dew-point ti, and then with this he gets from a table giving the tension of vapor in saturated air for the different temperatures the Yalue of b.

"The number of experiments made up to the height of 7,000 feet, var_yiug from twentyeight to sixty-six in each step of 1,000 feet, are sufficient to enable us to speak with confidence; the results are that the temperatures of the dew-poi11t as found by the use of these tables are worthy of full Mnfilleuce up to this point. At heights exceeding 7,ooo feet my experiments do not yield a sufficient number of simultaneous readings to give satisfactory resulb;;, aull before we can speak with certainty at these high elevations more experiments must be made.''* But tbe tensions of aqueous yapor obtained hy Glai8her's method by means of foe factors in the preceding table, uased upon so many observations made in difiereut parts of the earth anrl at nearly all accessible latitudes, difter very much in some cases from those giYen by Hegnault'R formula in (:!8). Both Glaisher's formula and Regnault's have been reduced to tables; the former by Glaisher himself, the latter by Gu~·ot and others. From a com1larison of these tables the dis· crepancies shown in Table XII are obtained. In Gu;rot's tables the computations by the formula extend on1~- to the point where the tensions rnnish and change signs, and it is seen that at this point the tension gfren b~· Glaisher's table is still considerable. It is a <1uestion with meteorologists wh,y these tables, having the high authorities of Regnault aud Glashier, should differ so mucl1, and which should haYe the preference; but a little insight into the history of Regnault's formula clears up the matter. vYhat i!:! called Regnault's formula was, originally, a formula obtained Ly l\1. August from purely theoretical considerations. The constants in this formula were somewhat changed by l~egnault after the data upon which they depend became better known, aud the results then given by tlle formula were compared with those obtained by him from experiment and obserYation. The result of the comparisons was that it was necessary to change the theoretical constant 0.429 to 0.480, as gh en in (28), in order to ive the best agreement between the results of the formula and those of experiment and observation. \VitL regard t-0 the tlwory upon whieh the formula is based, Reguault says: "I do not think ti.tat the fundamental hypothesis a.lopted by l\f. Augm1t can be admitted as a basis of the calculation of the psychrometer; namel,r, that all the air which supplies heat to the moist thermometer falls to the temperature t' indicate,11 by the Ja.tter, and is c_ompletely saturated with humidity. It seems to me probable that the portion of the air which cools does not fall to t', and tliat it is not saturated with lmmidity. The relation of the quantity of lwat which the air takes from thn Lulb by eYaporation of the water to the quantity of heat whicli it loses in cooling is probably greater in proportion as tliat air is more dry, because in this st.ate it is much more susceptible of humidity than when it approaches its state of saturation."t With regard to his comparisons, he says: ''The coefficient 0.480 gives an almost perfect coincidence between the calculated results and those found by direct observation in the fractions of saturation which exceed 0.40; but it produces a difference greater than the coefficient 0.4291 and, in an inverse direction, for weaker fractions of saturation." He hence infers that the coefficient of the formula (28) depends on t-t11 and that this ''results from the fact that the air carries off proportionally more vapor when it is very dry than when it approaches saturation." Uegnault, then, not only does not consider the theory upon which the formula is based reliable, l111t says, al.so, that the formula. with the empirical constant· 0.4-RO does not give results in accordance with observation in fractions of saturation below 0.40. :By referring to Table - - it is seen that for ordinary ranges of temperature and humidity the two tables agree as well as could be expected, and it is onl~· in the case of extreme temperatures and low percentages of relative humidity thttt the differences become large. This is exactly what we shoultl expect from what lwgnault sa;ys of the empirical constant, for he says it fails for low percentages of humidity, and for very low percentages we know it entirely fails, since it gives negative tensions. Regnault had less than 100 obsern1tions, in all, for comparison; while, as we have seen, Glaisher bad many thousands, so that the results obtained from Glaisher'i:; factors and tal>les are undoubteUly more reliable, at least for small altitudes above sea-level, than those obtained from Gnyot's tables computed from tlle formula of (28). :But there is really little difference, so far as we can now see, between Regnanlt and Glaisher, since the results given by Gnyot's tables differ from those of Glaisher's but

little, except for low percentages of lrnmidity, for which, Regnault says, the formtlla from whieh On)·ot's tables ham heeH computed is not accurate. That l{eguault not oHly regarded the formula as being imperfect, hut also that a uew formula was desirable, is eYidenced from a dosing remark. He says: "I shall abstain for the present from establishing a new formula of the psychrorncter: I do uot corn;ider the elements at my disposal as sufficient." It does not appear that lw eYer undertook it, but it has been done hy Glaisher with an abundance of material on hand; with what success must he judged from comparisons of the results with observation. The trouhlP, them, with regard to tl1e flifterenees between the tables, is: not that there it< a ditl'erenc1· behn'en two great authorities, but that a formula calle<l Reguault's formula., but confessedly imperfe('t, bas heeu reduced to tahle8, which carry with them the authority of llegnault whill' they real!~· IUJn no such authority. Li. Jly a rcfercuce to the forlllnlw (28) and (:ll) it is iseen that the former is a fm1ctioll of thP harometric pressure, and tl1at the t<·11sion b should. increase with altHmle or diminution of pressure, all the other data remaining the same; while according to the latter the value of 12 , aml couisequently of b, is th<' same for all altitudeH. Hence, if the two formnhl' gave accordant results at the earth's surface g·enerally, thPy would differ for high altitud1·s, especially for low percentages of humidit~-, in which the last term of (:!R) becomes large. lJnless the theory of .M. August, upon which the formula of (28) is haseri, is entirely erroneous, and the approximat-e aceuracy of the theoretical coefficient 0.4'.!\l is merely accidental, I cannot seC' how the tension of vapor for the same tP111peratnr1\; of tlry arnl wet hulh can he the same at all altitudes. As the presi-mre i;;; diminished tlw Pn1porati011, all other circumstaJ1ces being tlle f'ame, must be acceleratetl~ aud the diffore11ce between tl1e dry aud wet bulb tem11eratureis dimini8he1l, antl hence the formula (::H) must g'i\'c too 8Irn1ll a ,·apor tension. Yet the comparisons of the results g'iven by <Hahsher's factors with obserrntions at Ligh altitudes:, we Jiave seen, seem to be satisfactory, and there are no imlicafoms that the tPnsio11R for the s»me temperatures of dry aud \Wt bulb incr·,ase with altitude ati thr~- 11111:-;t h.r the formula of ('..!8). Jfogmmlt had 110 observations of much wcig;ht in testing thr formula in this I'l'SJH'('t, arnl remarks that it will he desirable to make experiments in very clenttcd localitfoH to ascPrtain whether the second term iu ('.!8) 1~orrects properly the formula for the variations of B. If ~t seriPH of Fmclt expPriments: were made on Pike's Peak, or at some other ,·cry eleYated station, t!wy would be of great value in settling this quPstion. It is seen from Table :XII that, for low altitnd<·s abow sea-level aml small fral'tions of saturation, the ntpor temlions gh-eu by (2i') are smaller tlrnn those given hy Glaisher's factors: and tables; but these teuisions are the same by the lat lr for all altitudes, while by the former they must increase as ll dirniuishes, that is, as the altitude increases. }?or altitudes from 011e to two miles the differences between the results of formula (::l8.) and those of Glaisher's factors are generally s1mtll and of little consequence iu barometric h~'psometr.v. For differences of altitude, therefore, of about three mileN. where the lower station is near sea-level, if formula (28) is used for obtaining the \'apor t.ensious of the air, the results in determining difi'erences of altitude by (25) will differ but littfo from those ohtainetl with G laisher's vapor tensions, since at the lower station the value of e' with the former is smaller and at the upper station the value of e is larger than tlwy would he with the use of Glashiel"s vapor tensinns, and consequently the value of (e' +e) in ('..!ii) is: Yer~' nearl,\· the s:tme with hoth. I·'or sm:1ll diflerences of altitude the uneertainty in the h,rgrornetrical formula is of little consequence. The formnla of (28) will, therefore, be used in obtaining I>, awl with it the ntlne of c in (4), in applications ol' the formula (22) or (25), so tllat if Glaisher's factors are correct for high altitudes, the resnlts obtainrd with formula (28), instead of Glaisber's factors, must also be nearly correct, even in cases in which the differences of the vapor tensions obtained b,y either method ·are of any consequence, uamel,r, where then' are large differences of altitude and low peroo11tages of humidity. 16. It, must he borne in mind that formula (25) is correct onl~· in tlw case in which the decrease of temperature and of the value of e is very nearly as the increase of altitude, and that, eYeu wit.Ji the correction C in (22) it is strictly applicable only to the case in which the decrease of these ·quantities with increase of altitude can be expressed by the first two terms of the expressions ot' (16), and in which the second term is small in comparison with the first. In the annual arnl diurnal averages of one or more years this is, perhaps, always the case, and it may often be so in

EYen the formula witli the correction C (:!~)) is not ap11licahle iu this case, 8ince~ on account of the rapi<l decrease of temperature with increase of altitude near the surface, the temperature cannot be represented by the form of (Hi), at least unless the second term becomes too large in comparison with t,he first for the formula to be applicable, and even if it were, we wouM h:we 110 means of determiniug the constants o and c' iu that expression. But if the lower station or stations, from which the temperature t" is determined, are situated iwar the sea, or large lake 7 where the annual range of temperatures may not be so great as that of the temperatmes of the air above, then the va Jue oft" obtained fr01~ the ohser\'ations at those stations mas be such aK to make ~(t"+t) less than the true ~weragc~, and then the ,-alue of H from formula (:!·i) may he too small. This would especially be the case if the value of t, observed at the upper station R, were, for some reasons, also less thau the temperatures generally in the vicinity at that altitude. This may he the case often where the stHtion B is located high up on tlie t-0p of a mount· ain peak, for, as in warm weather diere are always ascending curreuts up the mountain sides, the. rate of decrease of temperature with increase of altitude approxima.tes to that of rapidly.ascending currents, which. in the case of dr~' air is about one degree for each 100 meters of ascent. But tltis is a much more rapid decrease of temperature than that which exists in the air generally, and hence the air of these currents when it arrives at the top of the peak may he colder than that of th1~ air generally in the vicinity at that altitude, and than the air at B would be if the mountain were away and there were no ascending currents. In the winter season, and especially during the coldest part of the day, we have just the rev~rise of what takes place in the summer season. Then the surface temperatures at both A and B (Pig. 1), on account of the greater radiation from the surface than from the air, are much more diminished than those of the air generally at some height above the surfaee, so that if in this case Ab represent the temperature t", and Cd' that oft observed at B, aud Ce' that of the temperature at that elevation unaffected by the cooler mountain surface, then the temperatures of the vertical DB are not represented by the co-ordinates of the straight line b'd', but by those of the curved line

CHAPTER II.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF THE THEORY.
1 fJ. By means of the formulm in the preceding chapter, with the necessary barometric, temperature and hygrometric observations, the difference of altitude between an,y two stations can be computed, with results more or less accurate, according to the accuracy of the observations and the conformity of the temperature and hygrometric state of the atmm;phere with that assumed in tl1e formulm. Small, unavoidable errors in observations may affect thrse results considerablJT' bnt the greateRt errors arise, as explaine'l in § 16, from assuming tl1at the average temperature aud hygrornetrie state of the air column is the mean of the observations at the lower and upper stations. 'fhese errors affect the results, not only in.the case of one or a few sets of observations, made at any time of the day or season of the year, bnt likewise in the case of monthly averages. With a great muu her of obHervations, however, made at different seasons of the year and hours of the day, and especially if these observations an~ made regularly throughout the year, and at such hours of the day as g·ive the mean temperature nearly of the day, these errors are in a great measure eliminated from tl1e result. But even in this case there is considerable nucertaint.r where we do not lwve tlie means of determining the permanent barometric gradient of the place, if the two stations are a considerable distance apart. The practical application of the preceding forurnlm can be very much facilitat~d by means of computed tables, adapted to the several rnriables in the.formul:e used as arguments. Such tables have been computed with the improved and most recent constants given in the preceding formul~, and much study has been gfren to this part of the subject, in order to have these tables as concise and convenient as possible. Such tables are much needed in this country, since the tables in use here mostly are based upon the old constant, determined by l~amond nearly eighty years ago, which is now knowu to be erroneous. This constant bas been used in seven of tlw eight different formula~ aud sets of tables ginm in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, the eighth being Bessel's formula with the constants correcU,>d by Plantamour in accordance with Regnattlt's (letermination of the densities of mercury and air, but with corresponding tables adapted only to French measures. Besides, neither the formulre nor the tables are in the most convenient form for practicable application. 'Williamson has reduced these formulm to tables in English measures, adapted to computation without logarithms, but such tables require great expansion a.nil are inconvenient, both on

account of their great bulk aud because they must necessarily be tables with two arguments; for every computer knows how iucouvenicnt it is to obtain numbers accurately by interpolation from a table with two argnments. The tables liere given are ~rranged more after the concise and admirable forms giYcn h~' Wihlman, hut are giYen in English insteall of J?reuch measures. 'rhey are, however, so arranged that they can be tisedwith almost the same convenience in the latter as in the former measures. \Yith one exception they are all tables with a single argument, and the quantities to he taken from the table with two arguments are generally so small that they can be obtained with sufficient accuraC,\' with very little trollhle. These tables are adapted to computations with tlie mm of logarithms, ' which is most conv1111ie11t where a table of logarithms is at, hand, bnt it, may sometime:s be desirable to ha\·e tables hr which the computations can be. made without the use of logarithrn:s. For this purpose a modi; of computation without logarithms has been devised iu which the 8amc tablc8, with oue exception; can be used, and therefore re(1uiri11g only one additiomtl table, instead of a complete and separate set of tables.

The principal constant in (:?5), redncetl to feet, is (l05:!1.5, and the term .00183 (t" +t) 1 for degrees Fahrenheit becomes .001017 (t"+t-G40). \Yith these changt~s the formula ('..l.I), hy means of (30), can be put, into the following form adapted to English measures and computation by logarithms: log H=log (log B" -log B) +log (i0,j;!l,5 [l+.001017 (f 11 + f-{iJO)J Table I, arg.

The logarithm of the first term in the preceding formula cau be ohtained from any table or logarithms of Jive or six places, and that of each of the other terms can lw very conveniently obtained from tho tables de;;ignltted with the argmueuts col'l'espon<liug to each. 'fable II can be use1l where b1 and B are gfren iu millimeters by multipl~·ing each h~· .OJ or a11y other number which will bring the products within tlte limits of the range of the arguments given i11 the table· Table III uet>ds oulJ· to be entere1l once if the sum of the argnmeuts of the terms is used, that is,
(t' -t'r )+(t-t1). It is usual to reduce barometric readings to the temperature of fret·zing, but where ohservatiom; are made solely for the purpose of determining differences of altitude it is best to not correct teem for temperature, if the barometer, a:s mmal, lta8 a bras8 scale exteu1li11g down to the ci:stern; for iu Ruch m18e the effect of the correction is more cmn-e11ie11tly applit·tl to the result by mea118 of

In rednciug each of the rea<liugs to the temperature of frcezi11g, a cornpamti\·ely lnrge tal1lc has to be entered twice and two corectioH8 have to he applied. \Vhere the vapor tension,; are given instead of the temperature of the wet bullJ, t 1, of the psyehrometer, as frequently liappeus, Table III must be omitted aml Table Il usetl with the arguments b' and /J i11st1~arl of b' 1 and b1 · In this case Ii' am! bare obtai1wd from Table IX (Table X for French measure8) with t' and t as arguments. But wl1ere h~·gTouwtric ol1sPr\·atio11s are made especially for determining differences of altitude, it is most con \-e11ie11t to urn Table II I and TalJle II with li' 1 aml b1 as arguments, since this saves the labor of obtaiuiug from formula (:!1') the values of b' aml I>, for this, e\·e11 where the last term iu the fornmla is rednce1l to a tal1le, require:s consitlerable time, while the use of Table III is YeQ- conYenient, the table beiJJg Yery 8mall, and having only one argnrnent, which is very readily obtained. It often ltappeus that 110 h~·gTometl'ic obsel'\'ations are maae at either station. \Yhen tl1is is the case Table IV mm;t be used inl'ltead of Tables II and III. This table is computed from the expression ofj(e), gi\·e11 iu §17: reduced to Engli:sh mea8ures for tlw l1igl11·1· te1uperat11n~s, but for the lower temperaturei'l tlw IJUlllbers <lre incrnased a little to remedy tlie <lefh~t of tltis expression for low temperatures aml to make the numbers for these temperatures positiYe. In all eaRei! iu which yearly averages are used this table can he usell without any sem;ihle error, arnl <\Yell with monthly averag-.-,s, or average8 of a11y series of observations exteudiug over a considerable period of time, the error is ver,Y small. 31. The preceding exprm1sio11 of log II cau be llllt into the following form:

Thiis arrangement makes N 1 vanish at the mean temperature of 500 Fahr., and hence makes it small for either extreme; and as all tlie other Yalues of N 0 are geueralls small, the value of' the last term in the expression above is small. \Ve can therefore put H=(A-A') (l+c) in which A=60521.5

The other logarithms of (l+N.) are obtained from Tabler; H to Vll, indu,;i\TC, as iu the compu.tation by the formula with logarithms.

Tlie approximate latitude of Sacramento is :~so ;;:"V, and that of Summit ;:no 20'. The altitude of Sacramento is onl.r al.Jout. 30 feet above sea-level. 'l'he distance of Summit from Sacramento in a straight line is 77 miles, in a dfrection a little north of east. The exact difference of altit.ude between the barometers of the two stations, as ascertained from the railroad levelings, is 6,!.189 feet. lJy computing the values of lI from eitch set of monthly iweragt'S, as in the example of § 25, we get the values above. It is Reen from the column hea!led J, which gi1·e;.; tit£· excess of each monthly value of H above the yearly meau, that there is a large annual iueqnality in these values of H, the values being too great in summer and too small in wi111",er. These arise in part from abnormal irregularities in the averages, but mostly from assuming that the nlue of ~(t' + t) iu the formula expresses the true average temperature of t11c air column between t.he levels of the two stations, as has been already explained in § rn. If we suppose the monthly values of H, as gi\·en by the formula, to be reprcsentell by

H=A+B cos (it-c)
in case all abnormal irregularities were eliminated, then tlw most probable Yalue;.; of the coustantR Band E in this expression, a;; gi;ren br (26), (30), arnl (31), Part I, are H=<iiJ.H foet aud E=l47o.s. With these constants this expression gives the most probable ,-alnes of J, denoted hy J' above, and such a8 would be obtained from a st·ries· of ol1sern1tio11s continued through so long a period of time that all abnormal irregularities would be eliminated. It al;.;o makes the maximum and minimum of this annual inequality occur about the first of June aud December respecti\'el,y, and the vanishing nodes a.bout the first of March and September. The maximum of the inequality, therefore, does 11ot occur in the middle of summer in this c~n·e, and the re1-\Ult. indicates that t.he value of -~(t' +t) difl:ersm10st. from the true 1wcrage temperature of the air column het.wPen the lc\·els of the two stations, a li1.1ut 'the fir8t of June and Deccrn ber. This arises from the 1mrface temperatures, especially in the valley of the Sacramento, being incrmt8ed more rapidly from t.he sun's radiations <luring the spring than the air i;.; at some distance ab(we the Rnrface, and from being decreased more rapidly during the fall h.r the ra.dia.tion from the s11rface. The average of the monthly values of H aborn, G,9H5 feet, ditlers 3 feet from the value of H obtained from the yearly means of the Qhserrn tions. Since the expression of H (2.3) is not strictly a linear function of the observation, the principle of using averages of oh;.;erntt.ions is not strictly correct, especially in the case of the yearly meaus, in wl1ich the ra11ge of the observed values is \'ery great. In the case of the monthly averages this range is less, and hence the mean of all the monthly values of H must be rega,rded as being more nea.rly correct tLau the value of H from tile yearly means of the obsel'vations.

REPORT 01" THE SUPERINTENDENT O"h' THE

Tbe mean of the rn011thl,v Yalne8 of' H, li,%5 fi'et, is 24 feet kss than tlie true valne obtained hy Je,'elinµ;. This; i:s probalil,v due to the effect8 of barometric and temperature gradients in the mean annual 1n·es,.;m·e8 :tll(l tt·.mperatureo;:, which ha,,e heeu necPssarily llt'.glected in the computations, since there were no means of 1letcrmini11g tl1Pm, so that ihe Yalnes of H' aud t' were nsPd instead of B 11 and t 11 , which tlle formula reqnireo;:. That th1~re is an increase of mean annual temperature in a direction from Sacramento to Summit would seem to he indicated h,r the simultaneous temperature observations made h~- Profo1<1'or \Yl1ituey at Colfax, an il1te1Tening statiolJ betwem1 Sacramento aud Summit.. The mean of th·' three years at Sacramento, as seen aho\-e, is 590.H, while at Colfax, which has au altitn1le 2,±00 foet greater, the mean telllperatuw for tile 1'ame time is ()(JO.G, and henc(' gn1ater. This reduee<l to the len'l of Sacranwnto wit.it a11.Y ordinary rate of 1lec:rP.ase of temperature with increao;:e of altitrnfo wonld give a great i11crPase of mean temperatnre from Sacramento to Colfax, n, !lista11ce of only ·i·i miles. Of conrse tht>re cannot he auy hut a Yery small general gradient ext~·n'1iug a c011sii!Prahlp llistauce in that dir<>etion, and the abowi re.suit shows the great m1eertai11t,\· in tcmperatnrP ohsern1tions at the earth's surface, ari,.;ing from great local \-ariatiuns, or from 1lilforeuce,_ of positions of the thermometers with reg·ard to elevations abo\'e the surface, and from other causes. lle11ce the observations of snrface te.mperatures at the two stationH, even in the caf\e of ammal rnt:aus, camiot be relied upon to giYe the :wenq.!·e temperatnre of the air column betwPen the lm·cl of the two statiorns. The ditforeuce above of 24 feet between the true and computed difference of altitude corresponds to an error in the mean temperature of the air colnmu of ahont !! 0 · J~nt a co11Hid1·ral1lo part of the nrO!' in the compntcd ntlne of H may he due to a gradient of increasing- rneau barometric ]H'Pi'Htl!'e in the direction of Summit from Sacranwnto. A graclient which wonl<l (·anse the harornetric ]Jl'(·ssnre at Summit to he ouly 0.02 inches higher tlrnn at 8acrn111tmto, up at tlw same len~l, would account for the difference. of 24 feet. It is not. improbable that there iR a g-radient of that magnitude dne to loeal causes of no great extent, hut that tlrerc is Huch a gradient extc11tli11g to a considcra!Jle distance is not probable. Wl1ere there hi a har0metric p;rad1e11t i11 the mean annual pr<>ssur<>, there iR also au annual inequality in thiR gradient, ttnd hence a Rmnll part of the mrnnal iIH·qnality in tl!e value of II, as given h~· the formula, may be <111e to tliis m11rne, but it is mostly dne, 110 1lonbt, to errors in tl1e averag-e temperature of tlw air column, obtained from the mean of the two stationR. vVith tbe yalnes or (t' -t) in the pre<"eeding table of resultR we gPt the last two columns, showing tlie rate of decrease of temperature with increase of altitude. The aunnal ineqnality in the monthly rateR is YerJ large, this rate being nearly twice aR large iu April in October. This arises from the more rnpiu iucreas1· of temperature in the Sacramento Valley in tlrn spring, tl1an at Summit, where the increase of temperature in tlrn spring iR retarde1l by the J!lelting of the Rn ow on the mountains. The annual mean of this rate of decreaRe of tcmpcratun· iR less than 'usual, hut if it had been determined hy comparing the observations of t.emperatnres at Colfax, instead of Sacramm1to, with those at Snmmit, tlw rat(l of 1lecrcase wo11Jd l1ave heen found to Ge nearly twice as great. ']'hiR shows the uncertainty in the rates of decrease of ti:mperature with increase of altitude as tletPrminrnl from surface observations on the slopes of mountain siues. 2;"i. 'raking the aYerage of ollfier\'ationR made by Professor 1-Vhitney at Sacramento and Summit for the hours of 7 a. m., 2 p. rn., awl !) p. m., we get the following U\'erageR:

B.r reducing tlie barometer and temperature of all the stations haviug an altitude tess than
1,000 meters to tlJe level of Gene,,a, the former by the metlwd given in §33 and the latter by the rate of 00.57 per 100 meters of difference of altitude, we can determine very uearly the barometric

and temperature gradients at the level of Geneva. The uncertainties ii~ the reductions for the differences between tlie altitude of Geneva and the rest of these stations are very large. :Keglecting very small irregularitieis, which may be supposed to be due to local causes, we get from these reduced pressures and temperatures the small clmrt, J<'ig. 2, islwwing the mean annual press1m1s aud temperatures for all places at the level of Geneva. This chart gives for St. Beruard, at tile level of Geneva, B"=726'"ru,5 and t"=10°.ll, which ltave been used in the computation of the altitude of St. Bernard in § 23. The chart shows a small gradient of barometric pressure increasing in tbe direction of .N5W., which indicates that Switzcrlancl is a little south of the maximum of the ridge of mean annual pressure extending from the latitude of 30° or 35° in the Atlantic Ocean over Spain and :France into the interior of Asia. It is not stated in what way the altitudes gh·en in the preceding table luive been determined, but it has been supposed here that those at least of a less altitude t11an 1,000 meters have been determined from actual leYeling. If, however, some of them have been determined barometrieally, it has no doubt been done hy a comparison with some near station of which the true altitude was known, so that even in this case the gradient would not be much affected. But if all the altitudes liad been determined in this way by a comparison of all the observations in all cases with those of the same place, as Geneva for instance, then in reducing the observatious to this level with the altitndei: thus obtained, we, of course, would not get any gradient. · The altitudes in the last column of the preceding table have been computed from the barometric, temperature, and hygrometric observations of each place and those of Geneva, the barometric and temperature observations of the latter place beiug in each case corrected for the eftect of the barometric aml temperature gradients, or, in other words, the values of B" and ti' required in the. formula were taken from the chart, Fig. 2, for the latitnde and longitude of St. Bernard. There is mostly a satisfactory agreement between the given and computed altitudes, except in the case of Sils. Perhaps the given altitude was determined barometrically by a comparison of parometric observations with those of Geneva, without taking into account the effect of barometric and temperature gradients, for in this way we would obtain an altitude too great. If all the altitudes were computed in the same way with reference to each of the other stations as has been done with reference to Heueva, of course we should in each case obtain somewhat dif-

Tbe values of R for St. Bernard n.re 11ot gi,·en, antl the ones here given, to be used in the compntatio11s, are the averages of Si ls and Chaumo11t. By comparing the values of P, and t for Ilasil and I,ugnuo, which are on opposite sides of the chart, Fig. 2, it is seen that the barometric au<l temperature gradients ha,·e only a very small annual inequality, the changes from mouth to month being mostly due to small uneliminated errors in the monthly averages. 'Ve may tberefore assume, without material error, that the gradients are the same for all mouths of the year, and shall, therefore, as in the com1mtations from tile yearly averages in § ~3, deduct the constant on·rn.3 from the barometer at Geneva to get the pressure at St. nernard reduced to the lenl of Genern, and add oo.s to the monthly values oft at Geneva to get the >alne of the temperature at St. Bernard reduced to the level of Geneva. This is supposed to give the temperature t" required in the formula much more accurately tha11 it could be obtained from reduci11g the obserrnd temperature at St. Bernard, through so great a difference of altitude, to the level of Geneva by any observed rate of increase of temperature with decrease of altitude. With the preceding reductions for the effects of the barometric and temperature gratlients, we get the followi11g data for computing tl1e difference of the altitude between Geneva and St. Bernard from each of the monthly averages of the observations: -----·--·-------------------

REPORT OF THE SUPERIN'rENDENT OF THE

The relative humidities R' and R of the lower and upper stations, respectively, to he used in the compntatiom; of H are contaiued in the preceding table. By computing witll tlwse data, as in the example in f.l3, from the yearly averages, we get the several values of H ahorn from each set of monthly averages of the observations. The average of the monthly values, 20G7m.6, differs from the true differeuec of altitude, :!070'", determined by leYeling, oul~ 2.4 m!'ters, and from t11e value in § 23, eomputed from the yearly ayerages, it differs 0 1".ti. The reason of this latter (liftere11ce has bt~en given in the case of Sacramento and ::5nmrnit in § ~5. 'l'he values of J ahoYe show tliat there is an annual inequality in the \'nlues of H computed from the monthl,v aYerages of ohsen'atinns, just a8 in the case of Sacramento and Summit, which is to be explained in the same wa.r. If we suppose the most. probable values of H given hy the formula, independent of all ahnorurnl irregularities, to be represented hy the expression of II gfren in§ 25, we get B=lOm.o, and E=l780.1. 'l'hi8 value of E indicates that the maxima and minima of H occur about the l8t of cTul,Y and ,January, rm;pcctivcl,Y, antl the vanishing epochs of J about the 1st of April and October. These t:>pochs, therefore, are a month later than in the case of Sncramento arnl Summit. ·with tlwse ,~a]ues of B and E in the expression of IT, § 25, we get the most probable Yalnes of H, 10 which correspond the valueR of J', whieh are the true monthly values of the aunual inequality with tile eftects of the abnormal irregularities eliminated. 'l'he mean rate of decrease of temperature with increase of altitmfo is considerably greater in this case than in that of Sacramento and Surnmit, and the ammal inequality in this rate is also greater. The epochs of maximum and minimum also occur later, as in the case of the values of H. If no hygrometric obsenations bad been made, and Table IV had been used im;tead of Tables Il and III, the value" of U iu the preceding table would have been increased by the amonnt;; contained in the column e. These are all 1iositive with one exeeptiou, and indicate that the va11or correction ginm by Table lY is a little too large for the higher temperatures. Tl1is is, 110 doubt, tile case for high altitudt'!'\ in rnouutaiuons regions, hut not so generally, for, the ti·mperature being the same, the amount of vapor in the air near the ocean is greatt'r than in the interior of coutiuents. Table IV, based upon Dr_ Hann's empirical expressinn of the most probable or average value of tbe amount of vapor in the atmm;phere, except for the lower temperatures, is, no doubt, as correct for general applicat.ion under all ciretunstances as it can be made where the amount of vapor is regarded as a function of the temperature simply. The last column in the preceding table, headed c', gives the errors which would have resulted if the effect of the aqueous vapor in the air had been taken -into aceouut hy means of Laplace's modified temperature coefficient in tile formula (25), .002 instead of .00183. It is seen that the errors throughout are negatfre autl quite large for the low temperaturm1 of the winter season, but small for the higher temperatures of the summer season. 28. From the reports of the Chief Signal Officer, United States Army, the following monthly and ~yearly averages of the n1lues of B", B, and t", tare obtainrnl from the monthly aYerages of observations made at, Portland, Burlington, and the top of ~fount "\Yashingtou. The latitude of Mount ·washington is 440 16', and the relatiYeposition8 of the three places are shown b~- Fig. 3. The barometric pressures g·iveu are reduced to sea-level. These show tl1at there is a small gradient of pressure iucrea:sing in the direction from Portlaml toward Burlington in the winter, and the reverse in Rummer. As l\Iount W asbington is nearly on a right line from Portland to Burlington, and at about two-fifths of the distanee, two-fifths of the difference between the pressure at Burlington aud Portland have been added to that of the latter in order fu eliminate the effect of the gradient, and thus the values of B" have been obtained. The pressures on the top of Mount "\Vashiugton were reduced to sea-leYel by means of the constant 6.31 inches from OctAiber, 1871, to March, 1874, and after that by the constm1t 6.:36 inches. These constants have been deducted in order to get the values of B in the following table. The temperatures were reduced to sea-l~el and tile eftect of a t:emperature grad.ient eliminated in the same way as in the case of the barometric pressures. In

As the l1ygrometric ohsen·atious are uot, gh·en, the computations mrn;t be made, as in the case of Sacramento and Summit, by m;ing Table IV instead of 'l'ables II and III. \Ve thus obtain the mouthl_y values of II above. 'l'hc mean of tbt'se is n,:~:.W.l'i fret. Two linct-< haYe hceu run with the t-<pirit-level from the railroa1l Rtatio11 at Gorham to tLe top of Monnt '1Yashingto11, the first by \V. A. Goo1lwin, ciYil engiueer, iu August, 185:!, and tlte 1weo1Hl h_y ('apt. T. ,J. <'ram, of the Topographieal Eng·inep1·s, fo1· tlw Coa"t Surn\y, i11 SPptemher, 18.13. Frnm the tin;t the top of l\Ionnt vYashington was dt'ter111i11e1l to l)(\ (i,285.li feet a hove 8l'H-level, arnl from the latter n,2n:1 fePt. The mean of tl1<>se is G,289 fePt. Tile preceding re,.,ult, tl1en'fore, ohtai11ed harometl'ieall_y, seems to he about 37 feet, too great. lly the same fornrnla we llan' t-<een tlrnt the altitrnl(· obtairn·d for Summit above Sacramento was 2-1 foct less tlmn that obtained from the railroatl s11n1·y. :From t11e Yalnes of .d, or the most probal>le values .J', in the pl'ecediug results, it is seen that liere also we haYe an annual inequality in the valne8 of H g·in·1t by the formula, lmt we liavc the umrnual result of the maximum of H occurring in the wi11ter instead of summer. This indicates that the values of 2(1"+t) are great(·r than tlie arnrag·e temperature of the air 1,olurn11 in winter and smaller in Rummer, jni-:t the reYerse of what is reqnirP(l to explain the tliscrepancies in all tlrn other cases we havP. examined. 'J'his is prohahl~· dne to the fact that at hoth of tlie, lower stations, Portland on the sea-coast and Burlington 011 the t>a8t side of Lake Cl1amplai11, the tliermometer was near a large body of water, which lowered the temperature iu its \"il'iuity in tlie summer and increased it in U1e winter, and thus made foe value of ~(I"+ t) too small in summer and too great in -winter to represent the average temperature of the air aboYe the earth's surface. The same would have occurred in the case of Summit, iu California, if the barometric obseiTations ha-11 been compared with those of Sttn Pmucisco instead of Sttcramento. At the former place the range of temperature is less than so Fahr., while at the latter if, is about 21:-i. Hence the summer temperatures of San Francisco are nearly 100 lesR, and the wi11ter temperatures as much greater than at Sacr:tmcnto, while the diii'erence in the pressures of the two pl<tces at the same level is very small. "\Vi th the temperature observations, therPfom, of San l·'rancisco i11stea<l of Saerameuto, we should have had the value of n(t' +t) nearly 50 greater in winter aud the same amouut less in summer. This would ham completely reversed the signs of the values of.din§ 25, and gfreu values of H having a very ltrge annual inequality with its maximum in the winter instead of the summer, as in the case of Mount vVashington. Treating the values of LI as in the preceding cases, we get 1~=2Ci 0 and H=60.4. The latter indicates that the maximum of H, with abnormal irregularities eliminated, occurs about the 6th of January, and the mean values, or vanishing epochs of A, :ihout the 6th of April and October. These epochs are nearly the same as in the case of GeneYa and St. Bernard, but the whole ine-

quality is rewrsed. The rate of decrease of temperature with increase of altitude is Yery nearly the same as in Swijzerland, both in the annual mean and for the seYeral months of the year. 29. Finally, we have in the Boktiu de la Socicdad l\frxicana de Geographia y Estadistica, Torno iv, p. 216, 1878, the followiug monthly averages of observations made three times a day for one year at Vera Cruz, latitude mo 11', an<l the citJ' of Mexico, latitude 19° 25', and longitude

The monthly valneR of II here are a little more irregular than in the preceding cases, on account of there beiug 011ly oue yt'ar'R obsen·ations from which to get the averages. The range of temperature being small, the annual inequality in the values of H is also small, and scarcely perceptible amidst the abnormal irregularities. The city of Mexico is about :J[i() miles west of Vera Cruz, but notwithstanding the disbrnee there is perhaps ,-ery little barom(~tric or temperature gradient between the two places, so that B' and t' can be used for B" and t" witlwut much error. The barometer at Vera. Cruz was 7 .8 m.-ters above sea-level. This, added to the mean valne of H aboYe, gives 2,287.4 meters for the altitude of the barometer at the city of Mexico above sealevel. The true altitude from railroad surveys is 2,282.5 meters, being nearly fh·e meter:::; less than the computed altitude. The rate of decrease of ternpemture with increase of altitude is yery nearly the same as in California. The maximum rate it1 in the fall and the minimum in tlie spring, and the range of inequality large. 30. From the preceding comparisons it is seen that the excess of altitude given by the formula over that obtained from actual leveling is, for
-24 feet. Sacra111ento and Summit, 3 years' observations, Geneva and St. Bernard, 12 years' observations, -2.6 meters. Portland and Mount "\Vashington, 6 years' observations, +37 feet. Vera Cruz and city of Mexico, 1 year's obserrntions, + D meters.

These results do not indicate that high degree of accuracy in barometric hypsometr.r, even where a long series of obsermtions is used, which was formerly supposed to be attainable by this means. In these comparisons that of Geneva and St. Bernard should have the most weight, both on account of the long-continued series of observations upon which the reailt is based, and also the great care with which the observations have been made. The observations havn been regularly made for about forty years, and the result obtained from the whole series differs very little from that of the twelve years here used. The signs, however, of the differences between the altitudes given by the formula and those obtained by leveling, one half being plus and the other half minus, do not indicate any t\rror in the principal constant of the formula, considering the greater weight which the comparison for Geneva and St. Bernard should have.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

In the comparisons of the results from monthly averages, we have seen that the differences between the true altitude and those gi,·en hy tile formula are still greater, CiJlecially at certain seasons of the ,vear, since there is an annual inequality in the results giYen by the formula, due to errors in obtaining the trne temperature of the air eolumn. \Ve hiwe also seen that there is a diurnal iw1q1;ality of the same sort, even greater than the annual. These inequalities do not only differ in range at diffenmt places, and, in the case of .tlw annual inequality at least, become entirely revenied, but tlw epochs of maxima and minima and of the Yanishing nodes of the inequalities also differ cousilkrahly at different places. For Sacramento and Summit the latter occur the 1st of March and September, but for Geneva and St. Bernard 011 the 1st of April and September, and for Portland and Mount "'Washiugton still a few <la.vs later. It is probable that these epochs are nearly the same for the same country as for California or Switzerland, and if so, arnl these epochs have beeu determined, where only a fow or a short series of obseffations are ma(}e for hypsometric purposes in an)' couutr~', they should be made at or near the times of these epoi;hs, or at least so taken that the effect of the annual inequality will be eliminated from the result. 1''rom what we have seen it would he useless to attempt to gi\'e tables of corrections for this inequality, as has been done iu a few instances, which would he applicable even within a very limited range of coun· try, for we have seen that the rauge of this inequalit~· nrny not onl;y change very much, but that in Califomia it may become entirely reversed by referring Summit t-0 Sau Fi:ancisco instead of Sacramento. · The effect of the diurnal inequality can be very nearl.v eliminated by taking the observations at such hour or hours of the day as will give the mean temperature of the da~·, but if these observations should he taken 1war either of the extremes of temperature, as the early morning or the afternoo11, the results cannot be relied on, as is seen from the results give11 in the table of § 25 in the case of 8acrament<' and Summit. In fact, at whatever hour of the day the barometric ob11ervations may he made it h; much better to US(' the mean temveratnre of the day with them than the extreme temperatures. vniere only a tew ohsPrvations are used those are best wliich are made at times when there is little dinma.l change in the temperature, aml when the diurual aYerage differs but littfo from the rno11t.J1ly :ffernge or normal temperature of the time of year. Sneh observations should not be taken when the air is foggy or rnist,y, since the weight of the air is increased by the particles of fog or rniRt in it. 31. Tl1e variation of the trne from the obseiTed temperatures in the monthly averages arises from the fact that the annual range of temperature is less in the open air at some distance from the earth's surface than it is at the RUrface. The longer the period of the inequalit,~.. the more nearly the temperatures should agre(.'. While in the annual inequalities the v~triatious of the true from the o\)served is generally only from about one-fiftl1 to one.tenth of the whole amplitude of the· inequalities, in the diurnal inequality it amounts to the greater part of it, the temper~iture of the upper strata undergoing but little change in comparison with that of the observed temperatures at the earth's surface. In the numerous abnormal changes o{ temperature with periods of one to two weeks, the amplitudes of the changes in the air at some altitude aboYe tlw surface must he less than those of the observed temperatures at, the surface, but the differences mnst be less in proportfon to the wbole change than in the case of the diurnal changes, and greater tlurn in the cast~ of the annual changes of temperature. In barometric hypsometry, therefore, where the observed temperatures di:ller very much from the average normal temperature of the time of year at which they are made we will get bett~r resnlts, where only a few observations are used, by uot using the extrPme tern· peratnre, but some one jntermediate between the obsern·d antl the normal temperature, just as in the case of monthly averages we get better rc>snlts for the months of extreme temperatures by using temperatures which deviate a little less from the mean temperature of the year than tlie monthly averages of temperatures observed at the earth's surface. In order to avohl the errors arising from using the extremes of the almormal irregularities of temperature it is best to use the normal temperatnre for the lower station, obtained from n~outhly isothermal charts, where such are at hand, or from a table of month l;y normais for the vicinity, which will be equivalent to supposing that the range of the true temperature of the air colunm in these abnormal irregularities of short period is onl~.. half as much as that of th"e observed surfaee tem·

perntures, or eveu lei,;s, since the rauge of the.se abnormal inequalities is generally less at the upper than at the lower station. 32. The principal part of the difference betwr<'n tlie true and observed temperature of the air column where only a few ohseryati011s are nsed, arises from assuming that, there is a regular decrease of temperature with incrca,,;e of altitude. This may be nearly so in yeitrl~< and even in monthly, aYerages, but we know tliat, for var~ons reasons, the variation8 from this law are, at any gh'en time, so great that the temperature may increase instea!l of decrnase as you ascend, and, where the difference of altitude is considerable, the true mean tempemturf\ of the air colnmu may 1lifter from the mean of the ohsmTed tP,mperatnres of the two Rtations several degrees of Fahren· lrnit. Each one of t.hese would affrct the computl~d difference of altitude the 4 ,\ 1 part, an<l lteuce would giye ris!· to large errors. A large part 9f the !'ITors iu barouwtric hypsometry, wliere only a few ohservatious are used, aml the true statio1111 are a considerable distance apart, arises from the local and ternpora1:y barometric gradie11tH, de1wndiug nvon the ,-arious c;rclo11ic disturbances of the atmos11here. 1f tlie stations were se,·eral hundred mileH apal't, au onliuary gradient, 1·mch as occurs frequently without ~1 grPat stor111, might affect the rmmlt a hundred feet or more. The differe11"·'·S of altitrnle, therefore, from one or even sevu·al days' observations cannot be relietl upon as h11ing more tha11 a rough approximation to the true diffl>rence. This has been shown by William:o;o11, who lrnH computed the diff1·rence of altitrnle hetweerr Gene,'a and St. Beruard from the obsen·atiom; for every day of the year Hi62. These differ from the true difference of altitude, in sorue extreme ca;,;es, morn tlmn 60 meters.

This value of H is only 3 foet less than that obtained in § 24. For much smaller differences of altitude it is only necesKary to take out the number corresponding to the last two arguments, and to use this instead of the mean of the five. In the example above tliis would giYe H=67.26x10'.!,!)5 =6925, but the error diminishes Yery rapidly with <lecrease of difference of altitude, and for a thousand feet or more is of no consequence. In Table XII the effect of the last two factors in the formula (2;)) is not faken into accouut, so that it is strictly correct for the parallel of ±50 and sea-len~l. But the effect of tliese two terms in the middle latitudes is \-ery small. Tlteir effect n1ion the diffon·nce of altitude between Sacramento and Summit, nearly 7,000 feet, is only about Ii feet, and proportionally in the same latitude for smaller differences of altitude. Tlie extreme effect of the factor depending upon the latitude, which of the whole difference of altitude. At the equator the is at tlie equator and the pole ouly values in Table XII are too small, and at the pole too large, in that proportion. In order to Imm all tl1e tables necessary in barometrie hypsometry, Table XIII is added, which is reduced to English measures from J>elcros's table.

CHAPTER III.

REDUCTIO:X OF nm lLUW)1ETEH TO

SEA-LE'n~L.

33. ln order to form a clrnrt of isobars, showing the l1arometric gradients aud the general distribution of pressure from barometril' obserYatious at different altitmles, it is necessary to reduce all these obsen-ations to sonw assumed lf'vel, which is ge11erally that of sea-level. This is a prob· !em somewhat tile reYerse of that of determi11ing the difference of altitude of two stations from ohsenatious made at the two lewls. Tbe same equation ('.!5) must be satisfied in both cases, but in the one H is the unknown qmwlity to be determined, and i11 the other B 11 , eitlier of which can be determined when all the otJier quautities in the eq nation are known. lu the uncertainties of reduction to sea-level both of the last factors in (25), at least in the middle latitudes, may be neglected, and the whole effect of the factor for the vapor correction is so small that it is only necessar,y to use its average or most probable ntlue, taken o>er the earth generall.y, for any gi,·eu temperature, neglecting its variations at different times and localities. By so doing we have seen, § 27, that in tl1e case of St. Bernard the greatest error in computing the altitude from the monthly anwages of observations amounted to only 2.3 meters, or 7.5 feet, which at ordinary temperatures, as is seen from Table XII, correspond to onl;y about 0.008 inch of barometric pressure. V\T e, therefore, get from (25), reduced to English measures,

V.There the correction oft" +tis known, it can be applied to the ar.g·nment, or where the errors in the values of R, m; computed from yearly and monthly averages of obseiTations are known, as in the case of Mount Washingtou and St. Bernard, these can be added to the true Yalue of H, and then the formula will giYe the true reductiou to Hea-level, with t" + t used as the true temperature. Puttiug .dR=thc excess of the true over the computed value of H we r,;hall have in place of (b) (c) Log R=log (R+L1H)-('fahle I+Table IV) The Yalue oft" at sea-lernl for yearly and monthly averages may be determined for any given station, as has been done in § 27 in the case of St. Bernard for the yearly average at the l~wel of Geneva, by means of temperature charts of which the small chart, Fig. 2, is a specimen. But for individual ohser\"ations or ·short series of observations, made at any time of year or hour of the day, the Yalue oft" cannot he determined in this way. In such cases it is usual to put t"=t+cH in which c represents the rate of increase of temperature with decrease of elevation. But c is by no means a constant, as we hiffc seen, for it is different for different localities and seasons, and als > at different altitudes, even where we have the average rate for a large number of observations In individual cases not only is c in the preceuing expression entirely unknown, but so great are the anomalimi in the Yertical distribution of temperature that the law of the expression eutirely ails. The value of c is sometimes assumed to be a constant for all places and seasons, but this leads to great errors in reductions to sea-level at the seasons of extreme temperature. Take, for instance, the case of Salt Lake City, about 4,400 feet above the sea-level. The average temperature of .Jnly here is greater than that of the plateau between the Missouri River and the Rocky Moun. tains, with an average elevation about 3,000 feet le8s. We have seen that· tbe value oft required in barometric hypsometry, and the same is the case here, is the temperature of the air generally around the mountain at the same elevation, and not tl1e temperature observed at the he$ted surface of a mountain or in some elevated mountain valley. The observed value of t, then, is too great in such a case to represent the temperature of the air generally at the altitude of the observation, and it is readily seen that if this temperature is reduced to sea-level according to the preceding

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

259

formula, with any average Yalue of c for all seasons and places~ we get a value oft" which makes i(t'' + t) much too large in this case to repre,;ent the true temperature of the air generally away from the superheated surface of the earth or mountain; for both t" and tare mucll greater than the tem perature of the air generally at the respective lewls of the sea and of the upper statiou. 3f>. The mean annual iuequality of the error in the reductions to sea-level arising from these erroneous temperatures is corrected in (c) by means of .J H, wht>re the monthly values of J H Lave been determiued, as at St. Bernard and :'.\louut \Yai:;hiugton, from com1mtations of altitudes with the monthly averages of R 11 au<l t 11 deterrnine(l from observations made at two or a uumber of surroundiug- stations. The meau diurnal inequality iu the error of reduction to sea-leYel might he corrected in the same way if we had honrl,v obser\·ations to determine the diurnal inequalit,\· i11 the ,-alues of J H. · \Ye have ;;een iu the case of Sn111111it, i11 California,§ :!;), that this inequality is very large, and consequently the nrors in reduction to sea-le\·el must he w~ry great where the rxtnm1e t(~mperatnres of the day are used. In faet it is seen from the comparisons of J T with J' r, in the tables of~ :!<I, that the range of the 1liurna.I ineqrnlity in t Lte true temperature of the air column is very small iu comparison with that of the obsen·e1l temperature15 of the two station~. and hence tlle temperature which shonltl be used in the c isr of the extreme temperatnrc:-; of tlie da.r 8hould deviate verJ· little from the mean ~emperature tif the da,Y, aiHl thi8 is especially the case for Rummit. ·where the obsen·ed temperatures dC\·iate from the mean of the day, so far as we now kuow from the innstigation of oul,y two cases, it would he best to add only oue-fourth of this lleviation to the mean temperature of the da~·, excluding the effect of tlte other three-fourths, whl"'re there are a11,y means of determining thi8 wean temperature. At an,Y rate the extreme temperatnres of the day, especially when the diurnal range is great, must not be used~ if we even han~ to rely simply upon a11 exf\rcise of good judgment in determiuing what temperature sboald he used. In order to avoid the errors from using the extremes of the abnormal inequalities, it will be best iu reductionR to sea-level, as iu barometric hypsometry, to use for t 11 its normal value for the season of the year, obtained from the monthly normals, as explained in § 31. This will <limiuish the effect of these obsern:d deviations from the normal temperature one-half or more, and make it generally correspond very nearly with what would be gi\·en b,\· the true aYeragP temperature of the air column. :l6. Since B 11 , i11 the expression of (a), h; a functio11 of three varialJles, B, H. aud (t 11 +t), it it<> 11ot convenient to gh·e tables for obtaining its value under all circumstances, unles1<> the tables arc ,-ery much expanded. ""Where, howeYer, reduction" to sea-level are required to be eontiuually ma<le for the same station, as in tile \Veather Bureau of the Signal SPrTice, R, with reganl to this· statinn, becomes a constant,, aud the expression of B" t:au he reduced to a linear funl'tion of only two variables, arnl hence requiring only t\"rn tables with a single argument Pach.

The last term of this expression comes in where a rnlue of II a little different from the true value is required, in order to correct for error in assuming tlrnt ~(t" +t) is t,he true temperature to be used in the formula. The first term of this expression is girnn by (/),from which it is seeu that it is a function of only one variable (t" + t) entPri11g into the a,rguments of the tables, H 0 aud H being known constant quantities for any given Rtation. Hence, R"11 is readily given tw a table with t 11 + t as an argument. The coefficient of .dB i11 tlie 1<(·coml term of (g) is not strictl.r a constant, since the value of B"o in (.f) depend8 upon the temperature; but liy using the mean value of B"0 it may be regarded as a cont:ltant without material error exeept in 80me extreme cases in which the variations of both B aud the temperature from their rnea11 values are very great. This term, then, can be reduced to a small table with JB as an argument. Or, if thought necessary, the variahlc Yalne of B"0 can be nsed, and a small tahle can lw formed having JB m11l (t' 1 +t) as arg·nmeuts. 'l'he last term in (g) is also a fnnctio11 of the temperature, hnt this term is so small that tlie mean n1J11e of (t" +t) in thr· dPnominator may be used without sensible error. \Vhen JH is known this can be re1luced to a small table, with JH as an argument. In general on]~· the mean monthly \·alm~s of .:HI are known for a11y stati011, <leterminerl as in the precmling secti011s for Hummit, l\lount \Ya,;hi11gfa111, aml St. B('rnanl. Jn such ca~ms only the meau aunual inequality in the Yalue of B''o, arising from errors of temperature, can he take11 into ac1'.onut, and all the remaining part depeudi11g upon tltt> int>p:nlar ab11orrnal rlistnrbances must necessarily he neglected. C"sing the monthly values of JH, a ,;mall table ca11 be formed with tl1t· time of the year a,c; an argument. \Vhere the value of' .JH has not heen dett>rmined for auy station, of course this inequality can be determined in a more direct wa:· h~· reducing by means of (a) and (b) the monthly Yalue,.; of B to sea-le.-el, and then comparing them with tlie trne montlily values of H", determined, as in the case of St. Bernard for the le\·el of Geneva, hy means of monthly charts of barometric pressure similar to that of Fig. 2. 37. The following is a specimen of 1-mch a set of tables, made in the case of St. Bernard t,o reduce barometric observations to the le,·el of Geneva. The values of .JH, used in the last term of (!l), are the differences between the computed values in the table of § 27 and the true ntlue, 2,070 meter8.

When JR in Table II is negative, the correction is also negative. In connection with Table III the mean monthly values oft" are given, to lie used in obtaining t.he argument in t.he first ta.ble, as proposed in § 35. When t is observed at a time of day which does not give a mean temperature, a value oft which does not differ much from the mean must be used, as already explained. Of course this leaYes some uncertainty with regard to the proper value of t to be used generally, but this cannot be arnided, since it is impossible to take into account, in all special cases, the abnormal variations of }(t" +t) from the trne temperature of the air column. As an example of the application of the preceding tables, let us suppose that we ha,·e observed on the 1st of May at St. Bernard, at a timt~ of day which gives the mean temperature of the clay, or nearly, the value of B=573 1m 11 .5 and t=oo.:;. From (d) we get, in this case, L1H=i"i73.5-560= 13mm.5; and from Table III, t"=l:.! 0 .5. Hence t"+t=l'.?,O,;)+o 0 .:l=12°.8. We therefore have Table I, argument Ul 0 .s, i20.1 Table II, argument 13rnm,5, li.7 0.3 Table III, argument Ma~· 1, B"=738.1 If the time of the maximum of the correction in Table III coincides with that of the great(lst temperature of the year, the correction might be included in Table I without sensible error. For St. Bernard the times of these maxima do not differ very much, but in many places, as Summit in California, the difference is nearly two months, RO that in such caRes tl1e correction of 'l'ahlt> Ill cannot he regarded as a function simpl~· of the temperatnre.

l u editing thf· following reports, it has bee11 my enrleavor, while 1n'eser\'i11g· the origfoit l form aud design, to omit such matters as wouhl be of no interest to tlle puhlit:, hnt wltid1 were properly commnnicated to tl1e Superi11tt·1Hle11t of the Suney. Of snch a character I ha Ye c011l'iiderPd the history of the work, in so mucll as it related to the diftienltie,,; e11couutered in it" prost·<:11tio11, and the variont\ reco111111e11dations as to special matters conncctetl willi futnre operation:-;. 1 ln1n· also considered that the same minutcuesi:; of dc:,;cription, either of metlH11ls 01· results. whieh was mani. festly proper iu a report tom~· superior, would be unnceessur.r in a papei· intended for general circulation. I bani, therefore, in some parts, condensed the reports consitler11bl,r, thong-\1 al\\"ays with ca1·e that the reader sltonld experienet> no difficulty in following the stP]lR b~· whicl1 I reached au.\· conclusion. In the inanuscript report;; autl i11 let.ters to tlw Jat-0 Sui~riutendeut, I ha\·e frequently testified to the kindness a.ud assistance rendered me by tlm inhabitants of Crisfield, Md., aud of the shores of the sounds, and I wish to again express, in a more public manner, my appreciation 'of their efforts, and especially my indebtedness to M:r. T. S. Hodson, the collector of the port. M~· thanks are also due to the members of the .Tohns Hopkins Zoological School, to Prof. B. V. l>.ainl. Uuited State;;; Fish Commissioner, to Mr. T. B. Ferguson, Ma1·~·Iaud Fish Comnm;sioneri to ~ll'. H ..T. llietc>, and Mr. W. H. Dall, and especially to Dr. W. K. Brooks for assistance rendered mt>. As such success as has attended m;y labors in tllis field is largely <lne to the zealous and pffi. cient co-operation of my brother officers and eompanions on board the Palinurus, [ lrnw felt it their due that their contrihutious t.o the results should be known. I haw accm<lin~ly pre.fixed to e~wh report the names of my assiRtanti;; and ha Ye specified those portions of tlle work for whieh tbes are in a measure responsible. I regret tbat it is not iu my power to more aclequately expre:ss my appreciation of tile zeitl arnl miergy tbey displayed, the arduous nature of their labors in the field, and the good jndgment they showed in the compilations assigned them in t11e offiee, a,ud while it is difficult to make a distinction, I teel my indebtedness to Master H. H. Barron, U. S. N .., to be greater tha11 to irn;r other one connected with the investigation. FRANUlS WINSLOW, Lieutenant, U. S. K.

INSTRCCTIONS.

Tbll instructions of the Superintendent, <late<l August 2, 18781 directed that tlw iuvestigatiou of the oyster beds should include the following: · 1. The determination of the positions and areas of the oyster beds of the Chesapeake and its adjacent wat.ers and the depth of water over them both at high and low water. 2. The determination of the character of the heds ; whether natural or artificial ; whether the

o,ysters were spread all over a giYeu area, or grew in clusters of large or small size, or were scattered singly or in small groups. · :t Tht· !leterruiHatfon of the temperatures of the surfitce and bottom water at each locality and th!.' v1·locities of the currents. 4. '1'11e preservation of specimeus of oyster8 of different age8, from each locality! and specimens of the bottom arnl bottom water. ;;, The th"tNmination of the existence of any deposit of mud or other earthy or vegetable material a!l(l the deter1uiuatio11 of tht> character of the bottom beneath the oyster beds. (i. Tlic tletermi11atio11 of the source of tli_e sediment if any was deposited and the means of diretti11g· it, if i11jnnon1', away from the lieds. Also to determine whether ice ever rested on the be!fa and so dt».;troyetl them. 7. The determirwtiou of tlu· !leu:sity of the water, with special reference to the quest.ion of displacement of t lll' salt water by tht> fresh water from adjacent streams and rivers.

METHOD OF CONJH'CTING THE INYJ<.:;STIGA.TION.

Tl1e exarninatioll of tlie different beds was carried on in the following manner:
1,-DELI:XEATION OF THE BEDS.

Tl1e senices of au oysterman of experience, and who was well acquainted with the localities
of tile ditfrre11t l1ecls, was first obtained; the Yessel was then anchored in such a position as to

enable h1·r 11:-;e as 011c of the points fo1· angling upon, and her position carefully fixen by sextant auglP>:< upon all points i·pcoguiz;~ble upm1 the chart. At the same time angles were taken upon any ohjPd that might he m:pfn] snbseqnentl~· in fixing positions, either of the boats or schooner. By cHT'l',Ying fonrnrd our owu points in that manner it was possiule t-0 dispense with signals, the erl·ctio11 of' whi1,J1 wrrnld harn oee;tsioned much delay and the sacrifice of time and Ia,bor, to procure an n1111ecessary <legree of aeenracy. The boats then ran traYerse lines, more or le~s open, over t ht> adjacent lw!is, t Jin :-;i:--:e of the interior angle and the length of the fine tlependiug upon the s11 Jl!HlSP!l size <I llfl character of the bed; our general method was to work with the tide and endeavor to crnss the lim·s m; we retnnwd oYer the ground. The "oyster pilot" was sent in one boat and one of the ship'. ., com pan,\·, who was an {)Id oysterman, was sent in the other. They were provided witl1 poles, whid1 ~n·1·e marke<l to feet, and continually probed aud examined the'bottom a.s the hoat passed on·r the luw. The depth of water and character of the bottom were recorded as in ordinary hy<lrogTaphic /'\111'\'P,\'S. Tim position of the boat was frequently e.scertained by sextant angle", but as the "points" were not always well defined, two angles were not considered sufficient, arnl angles on :tll prominent ol:\jects were taken. Occasionally, when in proximity to the schooner, mast-head angleH and bearings were used for ascertaining the position of the boat, and in a few cases the bearing and uistance of some well-<lefi1ted point of land was estimated· .At intervals the boat was auchored, her position fixed, and ~pecimens of oysters, bottom, and water obtained, and the temperature of the air, and surface and bottom water, observed; the character of the 1-;nbstrat um of the bottom was also noted, and the set and velocity of the current recortled. 'fhe obHcrvations fo1· at<certaining the character of the bottom beneath the surface and those for romperature were more frequently made than the others, and the current was measured only at such points as would give a fair idea of the genera.I ~t of the flood and ebb tides; but

whenever an oyster specimen was taken, all the obser\'ations, with the exception of thosl' for strength and direction of current, were made. Only geue.ral instructions <'ould be gin?ll as to tiH· points on the beds where it was desirable to obtain spP.cimeus of any ki11d, or ob,;errntion,; for temperature or character of bottom, and much waK necessarily left. to tlte <liscrntion of thi~ offict>r of the boat, not only with regard to those poiuts but also a:-1 to the general 1leli11eatio11 of the herh;. So far as it went the work was satisfactory, but there were thl'ee g-reat 1lmwliaek.s to tl:e lit"><; of the boats, viz: The time and labor necessary to effect an~·thiug with them, th1· i11aliili!y to Ui'iP the pole with any accuracy in depths over three fathoms, and the failure of the pole to dis<'m·er au.'· thing but the solid beds. We attempted to use with the boats a snrnll an!l lii-dit dredg«· made especially for us, but fonud it impracticable, the largest boat, when under oar:-:, foll,Y 11nm11ell, or when under sail in a stiff b!'eeze, being unable to tow the dredge or eYen to moYe it: (~onseqtwntly tlw boats were useless for collecting any information, except o\·er solid beds in le8s th:rn thrt>P fathom:-: of water. To define the limits of those beds lying in deeper water and of tl10se not Pntirel~- sotid, or where the oysters were scattered either in groups or singly, recourse was had to dn;!lging with the schooner, using an ordinary oyster dredge of 36 inches width aud with twelrn tet·tlt. This method was found to be so much more satisfactory in all respects, that all the boat. work, wlleneYer it was possible, was supplemented by dredging lines run by the schooner. TraYerses "-em made as wiU1 the boats, and observations for ascertaining the character of tlic bottom, both of the surface and substrata, observations of temperature, and the selection of the Yarious specimen1', wen· carried on. The position of the vessel, however, was more frequently ascertained thau had bPen enstornary in the boat work. The lowest possible rate of speed was maintained that was co11.~istent with safo and ready manoeuvering (a matter of some difficulty), and the dredge put OYer at iuterrnls Yaryingfrom two to ten minutes, aud depending upon the character and extent of the hl'cl, depth of water~ and ability of the crew to get the drellge in, it being at times necessary to hean· the Vl't">sel to ill order t.o recover it. The dredge was put over from the weather side~ aud, after haYiug· dragged a sufficient distance to insure its bringing up a specimen, should there he auy o_yster:-1, was ltanled in by band. The presence of oysters on the bottom was readily detected by placing the hand ou the clredging rope, the uneveu, jumping motion of the dredge as it g·athere<l the o~·stt·r:; a111l :-;!Jells being distiuctly perceptible. The dredge was usually ou the bottom from thirty to forty.fin seconds, which length of time was sufficient for our purpose and sometimes eno11g·h to Jill tlie dredge, a catastrophe which was not desirable. Soundings were taken along- the li11e1' 1 and, with the character of the .bott.om, recorded. The following form for keeping the record was used and found to he of great Yalue:

number of young smaller than the marketable size, and other pertinent remarks, were noted after each bani. At intervals during the day the number of dredging vessels in sight was recorded for reference, arnl snbsequentl,v an attempt was made to collect data for the estimation of the number of oysters taken in a day by Pach sail. At each anchorage the current was measured. Frnm the results giren h,\· m;ing the pole in the boats and the dredge in the schooner, the outline8 of the bells Jun-e been traced on the clrnrt, the lines defining their limits including nearl~ a 11 stations wheu the 11tnn ber of oysters was greitter than one-tenth to the square yard, and though in some portions of the beds, as shown on the charts, the number was less than one-tenth, ~-et other ciri·umstauces, such as th!· character of the bottom, the amouut of shell brought up by the dredg(', &c., ban~ caused then~ to he included as part of the beds. 'l'lrn limit of scattered o,vsters can on!~· be considered as approximate, as the lines were drawn Yrom information recl·i\·ed from local oystermen and from such observations as we were enabled to make 01mmln~s. As has been already stated, the boats were unable to ascertain the positions of ~ms I.mt the solid beds or large clm:>ters, and the schooner not being able to work in less than 8 feet of water, onr abilit~· to determine the area covered hy the scattered oysters was necessarily limite1l. As that area, and indeed that of the solid beds also, is variable, changing from year to year, the line indosing· the 8Cattered oysters may be considered as accurate as it is necessary to ham it.

'rhe mean rise and fall of the tides in the soun<ls is 80 slight (amounting t-0 2.8 foet in 'l'angie.r and 2.4 feet in Pocomoke)~ and generally the depth of water over the beds so great, that it was not eonsidere<l nec(·ssary to establish tide gauges except in one case; such tidal corrections as l1a,·e been applied to the sotrndiug·s IHn-e been obtaiued from the Uoai;;t Surrey Tidt> Tables. A compari1wn of the ril'\e a111l fall of 11H~ tides. as givei1 h_y those tables, with tltat given by a tid(' staff erectPtl at Clay lshrnd J,ight Hou8e, showed tl1at during tl1e months of October and No\·ernber t11e gre;Atest diffH·pn1:P waf.\ nine-tenths of a foot. Owing to the vernal and autumnal gale>1 the most considera hie departure from the usual height of the tidal water occurs at those seasons; and it is therefore probable that one foot will represent the maximum erro1: of the Coast Survey Tide Tables, and 3~ fret the maximum rise of the tide in either sound. Uonsidering the great depth of water O\'er the majority of the lwds, it was concluded that the slight variation in those depths caused hy the tides could ham lmt little influence on the oysters, arnl consequently the correction of sonnding>1 excPpt in depths less than three fathoms has been neglected.
SPECIMENS.

The oyster specimens, 754 in number, were selected from large quantittes brought up by the dredge anll tongs, the endeavor beiug to take three specimens of different ages from each locality. One specimen of' an adnlt oyster of two years' growth or more, one of from one to two years' growth, and one less than a year old, were usually selected. Shells, either old or new, and especially those having a large number of young clinging to them, were also occasionally preserved, and though a tew specimerns of oysters that had been transplanted were secured in order to show the· effect of change of water, bottom, and depth, yet no examination of the planted beds was undertaken. In the selection of specimens we attempted to reser'"e such as would indicate the effect of clifiereut natnral cornlit.ions. At the close of the day'8 work the oyster specimens were washed in salt water, opened carefully with a sharp-pointed, thin-bladed knife, and the upper valve detached from tlie mu>1cle, and then replaced. A small wooden peg was then placed between the bills of the i,ihell. tlw ml ,-es tied tightly together with twiue, and the oyster wrap pell in cotton cloth of a very open texture. The whole was placed in alcohol. The wooden peg kept the shell open sufficiently to allow the alcohol access to the· ho1l_y of the animal, a.nd the cloth wrapper preventoo the destruction or loss of anything of interest which might be attached t-0 the shell. Six parts of alcohol to four of water were lised, and to each specimen wa.<J attached a wooden label showing from when'ce tbe oyster came.

BOTTOM AND WATER SPEODfENS ·

273

.. The specimens of bottom were obtaiued from large amounts of sand, mud, and gravel, brought up hy the dredge or tongs. 'Yhen the bottom was hard, an ordinary bottom specimen cup screwed into a 25-pound lead was use,1, but m'er the solid beds, or where the bottom was of hard sand, it was n·ry difficult to obtain anything, either wit11 dredge, tongs, or lead. Tht> specimens of bottom water were secured h~- using the drop-water cylinders, which are fully described by Lieut. Frederick Collirn.;, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Snrrn,\-. in bis report on the "Densities of the \Yatero; of Chesapeake Bay aud Tri\mtaril's," publislwd by the S1u,·ey in tile RPport for 1817, Appendix No. 14. The cylinders worked as successfully as dnrfog the predous summer, and there can be no doubt that the water lirought up by them was a speci · men of that at the bottom. All the Hpecimens were teste<l with a hydrometer, and the rrnulings reduced t-0 those at the standard, temperature of 60° I~.
SFBSTRATPJ\I OF HOTTOJ\l.

The character of the bottom beneath the surface was roughly ascertained by means of au iron probe, ·i feet in length, attaclled to a long wooden staff. The probe was thrust a." far as po;;si.ble into the bottom, and the composition and character of the substratum estimated, the di1forcnt constitueuts, whether sanu, 1;hell, mud, day, or gra,·el, being· easiIJ· recognized. Owing· to tlw velocity of the currents, the speed of the vessel, and the difficulty of handling a long staff, hnt few determinations of the character of the snhstratum were made when the depth of water was gTeater

fathoms.
Cl'RREN'l'f;.

The currents were measured hy a current meter. or by an ordinary chip log, though the latter was not used frequently. The position of the stations for measuring tl1e current was left to tlw discretfon of the officer of the ooat, bnt a sufficient number have been occupied to show the 1'et aml strength of the main ctirrent, arn1 the effect 011 them of the prevailing winds.
N-Cl\rnER OF OYS'l'ERS '.l'O THE SQrARE YARD.

The number of oj·sten; to the l-llJUare yard was found by using a ground log in connection with the dredge. From the informiition derived from experieneed oystermen, and from our own cxaminatiou of those bed1; that had heeu dredged, l was of the opinion that a dredge, when of consideral>le size, and dragged slow l,v, 11s1rnll.v eollected ever_vthing mt\t l>y it in its course. Cousideriug that, at the suggestion of Mr. Rice, 1 used a"'Small ground log to measnre the distance traveled by the dredge. As that instrument was exactly one yard in width, it was concluded that it swept approximately clean one square .)-ar'l for eYery lin~ar ;yard it passed oYer. The ground log consisted of a small lead, a few ounces in weight, attached to a, light line. 1,000 foet long; between the lead and line was a length of cop[>er wire of 20 feet; t.he line was marke(l every 5 fathoms and kept i11 a tub or on a reel ready for use; the lead was conical in shape to prevent its catching on sbdl clusters. When the dredge was thrown oYer the lead was dropped to the bottom and allowed to remain there, tlle liue running out freelJ until tl1e dredge was lifted off the bottom, when the line was stopped and the number of fathoms run off with the uumber of o~·sters in tbe <lredge recor(led. The dredge was not allowed to remain on t.l1e bottom long enongh t.o be filled, consequeutl;v none of the oysters were lo~t from its inability to rccefr(' them. Though the foregoing method was imperfect it was the best ti.tat could be devh;ed nude!' llw circumstances, and a similar methotl was used oy l\loelius in ascertaining the number of oysteri-; 011 the Schleswig-Holstein bed. :From the ,-ery small number of oysters to the square yar1l, as showu by the metlwd, from the small number of oysters it assigns t{) the beds, and from comparison of the latter number with the number known to have been takeu otf t.11e beds daring our stas i11 the sounds, it is e"\'ideut that the ''number to the square yard" given in the recordis of the work are useful for comparison only; for in almost all cases the number uf o~·sters given to the squarl.' p.td must be considered as far below the real number. For instance, the number of oysteri-; on tbe beds in Tangier Sound, sout"b of Jane's Island Light-House, was estimated from the <lata of the S.Ex.49-35

Such could hardly have been the ease Jiad there bem1 hut 8,000,000 oysters on the beds, allll conseqnentl,) we must regard the "number of o.n1ter8 to the square yard," as shown by the rnetlioc1 used, only Yaluable as establisliing an initial number aud standard hy which the increase or decrease of OJSters on the beds may be a8certaiued, and by wl1ich oue bed or locality cau lw compared with ituother. Alone, the results of the dredge and log are Yalneless.
TEMPERATURE OF THE WA.TEH.

·

It was originally intended that the temperature of the bottom water should be obtained by means of thermometers attached to the "drop cylinders" nsed for obtaining the speciuw11s of water from the bottom, ~111d six of those cylinders were fitted at the office with mercurial thermometers, inclosed within the spin11le upon which thr cylinder mo\·es, the bulb of the thermometer ·being a little a born the center of the cylinder when closed on the lower disk, aud the gradnated stem beiug exposed abo\re the top, thus allowing the temperature to be read within any limits that would probabl_y occur. Under the direction of the assistant in charge of the office, a series of experiments were ma<le by Mr. H. W. Blair, in order to ascertain the correction to be applied to the thermometers wheu moved through strata of water of different temperatures, aml from water of one temperature into the air at another. \Yith tables of correction8 derh·ed from those experiments, and with care in using the apparatus, we hoped to arrive at results that would be very nearly correct, but .I regret to say that upon the fir~t occasion when the cylinders were tried the t.Jiermometers were showu to he useless. The cylinder is closed upon the lower metal disk by means of a spiral brass spring, which also holds the cylinder down firmly, thus pre\'enting the escape of the specimen. The spring acts with considerable force, and we fouml thitt invariably the shock of the closure of the <.;up was sufficient, tu break the mercurial column and ·prevent any reading of the thermometer. Attemvts were made on board the Yessel to remedy the evil b,y dimiuishing the strength of the spring, and by placing a rubber buffer ou the lower disk, but we were unable to prevent leakage, and subsequently the same difficulty was experieuced at the office. Owing to the failure of tbe thermometers in the water cylinaers, and the inability to obtain an~· a1)paratmi, at so short a notice, in time to be available for the season's work, we were forced to use ordinary unprotected thermometers, furnished by the Coast Survey Office, with corrections e11tahlished by experiments ma,de previously aud subsequently to the work of the party. The thermometers were fastened to a lead, lowered to the bottom, and kept there a sufficient time to acqnire the temperature of the surrounding water. They were then hauled up as rapidly as possible a1Hl the temperature read; at the same time the temperatures of the air and surfaee water was noted. Owing to the rapid change of reading when the thermometers were moved through strata of different tempefature, the observations are only reliable when the temperatures of the air, surface, and bottom water were identical. As the investigation extended over so short a period of time, and .as the spawning season had closed before we arrh·ed on the ground, the recorded temperatures are of little interest, and have been omitted in the following papers.
NA.MES AND AREAS.

In naming aml describing the beds I have used the local names gi"·en them by the oyst.ermen. Tile form "rock" is with tilem isynon.vmous with "bed," as t,bey regard only the solid porlious of the area co\·ered by the oysters. In the following pages the term" rock" indicates the solid, or approximate!.'' solid, portions of the bed. Areas are given in feet and miles. When the latter unit is used it is the nautical mile of 67080 feet, and not the statute mile-.

OYSTER REDS OF THE

RIVER, VIRGINIA.

The examination of these beds was a very hurried one, and the delineation must be regarded as merely approximate, being the rcfiult of a hasty recouuaissance. On tl1nt account no attBmpt has been made to produce a chart similar to that of Tangier and Pocomoke Sounds, but the ont1ines of the beds, as shown hy a few traverses run by the boats and as indicated h~· the local oysterrnen, have been sketched in roughly. According to such iuforma.tion as it was possible for us to obtain, tbe beds do not extend aboYe lleP-p W atf'r Light, with the exception of a few small ones that are seldom fisheu on the account of the inferiority of the animals. We had not time to detei·mine ourselves whether the information was correct, but I presnme it to be so. Below Deep 'Vater Light the beds of any consequence are tweh~e in number, and of a total area (approximate) of 10.4 :o;quare miles. Taki11g them in order from Deep 'Water Light to Hampton Roatls tl1ey are the Mulberry Point Bed, Point of Sl1oals Bed, Jail Island Bed, Blunt Point Bed, White Shoal Bed, Thomm\s Point Beel, Kettle Bole Bed, Brown Shoal Bed, Bally Smash Bed, Nasmvay Shoal Bed, Cruiser's Beu, and the N ansemond Ridge Bed. The beds are "natural,'7 and the following rt·urnrks apply to all. Cm·re11ts.-Nineteen obser.,,·ations were made of the currents, and established that, over the Mulberry Point, Jail Island, aud Point of Shoals Beds, the general set of the flood is NW., with a maximum velocity of OJi mile per hour, and the general set of the ebb SE., with a maximum velocity of 1.7 miles per hour. Tl1ese \'elocities were measure1l after or <luring· moderate to stiff N"·· breezes and spring· tiues, which conditions woulll increase the velocity of the ebb current cornsiderabl~·; it is probable that that velocity does not exceed one knot per hour under ordinary circumstances. The set both 011 flood and ebb is directly acrm;s t.IJe bed, but the main bod~· of water follows the deep ehannel to th~ southward, the ebb striking the shore in Burwell's Bay, and at times washiug a good deal of it away. Over the Blunt Point, Wl1ite Shoal, Thoma;;;'s Point, Kettle Hole, and Brown'R Shoal Beds the current sets NW. aud SE., with a maximum velocity of 0.8 mile per hour on tile llood. The ebb on the firist quarter showed a velocit.r of 0.8 mile per hour, and inobahly the maximum nlocity is but little O\Ter one knot per hour, as the great bouy of witter iiasses to the soutlnvard of the be.ds. On the southern side of the rh·er, over the Bally Smash, Nasewa.y Shoal, Nansemond Ridge, and Oruiser's Beds, the general set of the currents is NW. and SE., except where the Yery shoal spots are met, wbeu the current, becomes variable in direction thongh not diminis!Jed in force. Wlrnu the shoal ledge lies in the general direction of the river the effect do s not appear to be so great, but where the shoal extends across the main eurrent it is deflected from its usual course, and forms strong counter curreubs and e1ldies. Thus over the Bally Smasl1 Beu the ebb was found to set to the Sl<.J., with a maximum velocity of 1.1 miles; over the Nal'leway Shoal on oue side of the shoal ridge tl.Je set of the ebh was 8 W., with a velocit,y of 0.4 mile per hour; while on the otlrnr sic.le of the ridge an observation made at about t!Je same time sho~ed a set of O.'.! mile NE. When clear of tbeohstructing shoals the cnrrent sets to t,be north ward and westward ou the tlood, and t-0 the southward and eastward on the ebb, with an a\·erage >elocity of 0.5 mile ver hour. Over the Nansemoml Ridge beds and inside of them the flood sets in towanls Ragged Creek, a11d the ebb probably in the opposite direction. · In order to tletermine whether the salt water over the beds in the rfrer, and especially over the Mulberry Point, Point of Shoals, auu Jail faland Beds was displaced by the fresh water of the spring ebbs, specimens of water were obtained at every two fathoms of dept.b, on a section across

Comparing the specific graYity of the water obtained in the sections with that of two stations below Deep "rater Light, which was obtained at nearly high water, a difference of density of 0.0037 is ,.;hown-1.0000 representing· distilled water. So slight a change.of density can hardly have any material f'lfoct upon the o~·ster,.;, and, except during long· conti11ued freshets, wltich occur sometimes (lnri11g the spring, the animals i11 all probability do not suffer therefrom. Aceording to the oysterme11, during the winter ice frequently grounds on the slwal ispots on tlw Berls, but m·,·er remainR there long, unless the weather iR of nnnsnal severity, the strength of the cn1T1>nt and the ntria hilit,Y of the climate heing sufficient to re morn the ice in a short space of tinw. As to the amount of damage donf' the oysters hy the ice, opinions Yaried a good deal; the general imprc8sio11 wns tliat, thongh the oysters were poorer in quality and flavor, the ice did not remain long enough to kill many of them. Ouly a few persons could be interrogated, and they were not very intelligent; hut, in the absence of an~y opportunity to inveRtigate the matter onrsel \'es, their opinio11 is given. All the beds in the .James Hinw are subject to the deposit of mud and vegetable matter brought down hy t.l1e freshets that occur in t,he spring. The l\fnlberry Point, Point of Shoals, and Jail Island Bmls, owing to tl1eir position, arP particnla.rly unfortunate in this respect. The set of the current beillg directly acrmis these beds, they are the first to recei\'e whatever is held by the water. From the charncter and appearance of the river, it is probable: that a large amount of earthJ· matter is brought down by every ebb tide; but the velocity of the current is so great, and the sboal rises so abruptly between the Point of Shoals Light and Deep Water Hght, forming a wall and barrier, that the principal imrt of the sediment seems to be carried into Burwell's Bay, where it has gradually covered and deistroyed a large number of small beds. The springft'eshets always cover the .Mulberry Point, Point of Shoals, and Jail Island Beds, but not always for a sufficient time to very seriously (lamage the oysters, the current managing to sweep off the deposit in time to expose the cultch to the spat. Occasionally the damage is great; for instance, we were informed that during 1871 aud 1872 there were a succession of heavy freshets, which destroyed the fishing for several years. In 1876, tlle mud having hP.en washed away and the cultch exposed, a growth of young oysters was uoticed in all the beds about and above Jail Island .. In 1877 the oysters about Deep Water I1ight were good, and probably during the coming seasons (1878-'79), the catch on all the beds will be large, as at the time of our observations the oysters were numerous, with the young growth predominating. Apparently, then, it requires from three to five years for the beds to reco,·er from the effects of heavy freshets, and as the oyster becomes marketable iu about two years, from five to seven years must elapse from the date of the freshet before the beds can be profit.ably worked. Happily, the other beds are atfocted to a much less extent, though about the shoals on the southern side of the river the oysters are gradually deteriorating, presumably from deposit of deleterious matter. The variability of the currents about these shoal places, and the fact that the depth of wat<'r about them is decreasing and the shoals increasing in size, a.ppears to support the inference. Ou top of the Naseway Shoal, which is completely dry at low water, quantities of sheUs were found, and in its immediate neighborhood, especially to the northward and westward, the

oysters wer\-' of a very poor quality, having deteriorated much of late years. In addition to the deposit l1y the .James Hi\·er, the Nrmsemond Hidge and beds off Pig Point receive a, portion of the, sediment brought down by the ~ansemoud m,·er, but. other causes not operati11g, that deposit would not lw imtlicieut to seriously injure the beds.

'Without incurring an expense uot justified by the end sought, there is uo practicable means of protecting the hed1-; from this evil. Natural efforts appear to have sufticientl~· protected them in the past, and, if the~· are guarded iu other respects, the loss on accouut of the depr>sit of matter brought down h.v the current) which is but occasional, will not interfert=>, to an~- great exteut, \l·ith the industry. ,lfollil'>T.1f Point Beds.-These beds eomprisfl au a1·ea (approximate) of 3,fi;)6,00ll square yards. 'rhey lie to the ;;outhward, and westward of Mnlherr.Y Poi11t, on the north sirle of the Rwash channel, and northeastnn Ride of the main channel. l'oint <!( Shoals and ,fail Island Beds.-The l'oiut of Shoals beds lie to tl1e northward and eastward of the l'oint of Shoals Light, and comprise au area of 14,941,000 square yards, approximately. Tlwy are hounded 011 thi~ southward-and-eastward, southward, aml southward-and-westward, by the main ehannel, the one-fathom cmn:· of which clearly defines the limit of the bed, except for a mile and a half to the Routh ward of the light. Tltc northern boundary follows nearly the edge of thr swash cham1el, which l:leparates this bed from the ,fail hland Bed; the latter lies to the eastward of tlrn swash and northward of the mai11 channel, and has an area. approximately, of fi, 730,000 squart' yardi;;. Both the 1\fnlhe.rry Point and .Jail Island He<ls extPud inshore as far as tl1e sands which are fonntl ahont at thr one.fathom cun·e. The hydrography of the accompanying ehart of the riYer was execute.I in 187 4, a ml Ed nee that time rnry slight changes of depth of watt·r can ha ,-e occurred. It may therefore lle aecf'pted as giving the correct depth at the time of our examination. It shows that oYer the l\lnlberry Point beds the depth of water is from 1 or 2 feet in some places to 24 iu others; 011 the Point of Shoals he<ls the same irregular bottom exist8, the depth heing from 2 feet to 30; and on the .Tail Island beds from 3 to 16 feet are found. The soundingi:; are gh·en for mean low-water, Uw plane of reference; the mean rise and fall of the tides it; 2.6 feet, aud the maximum rise and fall 3.4 feet. The spring tides: howen·r, fall 0.4 feet below the plane of referenee, and consequently all the beds are sn~ject to the grounding of ice of more than 16 inches thickness. As, howm·er, tlte shoalest parts of th!cl bedi:; are situated on the boundary lines, they afford a certain amount of protection to the interior port.ions, tbe ice piling along the borders instead of lying in heayy masses upon the entire bed. On the shoalest parts of the beds tbe bottom was found to he a stratum of shells with a light etweriug of mud and a snbstratnm of hard sand. On these shoal places tlte o,vsteri:; and shells were most abnndant. Thi' oysters were not evenly distributed over the entire bed, but grew in detached patches and ridges on and in the Yicinity of the shoals, with numerous narrow mud sloughs intersecting and scparat,ing them. The deep wat,er was found over these sloughs, and, generally speaking, the shallower the water the larger the number of oysters and the thicker and more solid the bed, thi:; being especially true about the.boundaries, where the beds rise abruptly from the main channel, and where great difficulty was found in attempting t-0 penetrate them with the probe, while in the interior portions and in deeper water the surface stratum was of shells aud mud, with 6 feet, or more of soft mud underneath. On the ;Tail Island beds the bott-0m was of shells and light, yellow mud, the stratum being about 4 feet thick; below it the botfom was mud. From the appearance of the shelh; 1 judged that they had beeu ccwered for some time; and that, combined with the unusual thickness of the shell stratum, leads to the opi11ion that, thii:; bed was receiving a larger amount of the sediment brought down by the rh·er than either the neighboring oyster areaR. The oJ·sters on the three beds are of the class known among the dealers ai:; "snaps." Ther are small a.ml poor, single or in small clusters of two or three, and when not transplanted are used for canning. There was no sponge or grass attached to the "'hells, and but very few of the usual inhabitants of a bed other than the oysters appearell to be present. Young oysters, of about one

year'8 growth and under, predominated, and the proportion of young to mature o:fsters wa:s greater on the shoal spots aud ridges at the e(lge of the bC(l than eloiewhere, owing, probably, to the fact that ,-;u!]Jt portions of the bed being· shoalest, hardest, and cleanest, they oftered superior points for the attachment of tlie driftiug &pat. 'l'he oysters from the Jail Island Beu were considered superior to an;y in the river for planting purposes. though no reason was assigned for the preference. The oysters from all these lieds are generall,v trausplantecl uefore beiug sent to mal'ket. No oysters were found in the main channel, and iu the swash channel only a fow, aml those widely separated. Along tlrn southwestern side of the river aml main chauuel, iu Burwell's Bay, and oft' Day's Poiu.t, are a few small hedH, separated by large mud sloughs and mauy old "rocks" buried in the m1u1. Tue bottom is of red mud, wit.11 a substrat.mn of mud or sand. The adjacent bank:,; of the rin·r are of red clay, and appear to l>e gradually washing away with the swift current of the river. The ossters found were older than those on the opposite beds ou the Point of Shoals, but were of a poorer qnality, aud the bedi'i are seldom worked on account of the scarcity and inferiority of the anirna\8 upon them. Blunt Point Berl.-'l'his bed consists of a number of small rock8 of a few hundred yards area, with mtHl sloughs between them. The area of the bed is about 1,125,000 square yards, lmt al'\ the bed does not 1'i8e abruptly from the channel, like those already described, thus allowing a ready and uenrl,r (·.orrect definition of its outlines, the .nrea given for it must not be considered as more than a rough approximation. 111 the case of the Point of Shoal:s and Mulberry Point Beds the cl1an1rnls and sands defined the limit of the oyster areas. Iu the c.i,seofthe Blunt Point Beds the oysters are scattered in decreasing munbers from the center of the bed to the shores and channels, aud the accurate or even approximatel_y accurate delineation of the area covered by them would have required far more time than was at our disposal. The hed is subject to a deposit of 1m1d from the James Hiver, but to a less extent than those beds already dt~scribcd; it also receives some sediment from the WarI'ick Ri\rer. The bottom was found to be mntl and shells 011 the surface, with a substratum of mnd, except about the shoal places, where the substratum is luud, probably of iomnd. The contour of the bottom is more reguiar than that of the otLier beds, the depth of water as shown by the chart being from 7 to 8 feet. The o,vsttm; were more numerous about the shoals aud were distributed in a manner similar to tlto:se 011 tl1e hells previously 11·>ticed, beiug collected in groups aud patches separated by mud sloughs. They grew singls and iu small clusters with no sponges attacl1ed aud are of poor (1 nali ty. Thouuu1 Point, Kettle H<>le, and lVhit.e Shoat Bed8;-These beds are similar in character to the Blunt Point beds. The shm1l portions embraced by the one-fathom curve show the original format ion of the heel iu the past, and mark what may be termed the ba~kbone of the bed in the present. The area.s (approximau-1) are Thomas Point, 949,000 square yards; Kett.Jc Hole,.1,792,000 square yards; and \Vbite Shoal, 1,300,000 square yards. The bottom on the Kettle Hole and Thomas l'oiut Bells was found to be of mud aud shells on tl1e surface, the substratum 011 the Kettle Hole lwing- of shell aud sand, and on the· Thomas Point Beel of mud, except when near the shoal spots. 011 both betls llO o,vstert>. were fonud on the shoals when the falling tide expo:;ed them, but, great qnautitie., of broken >\hells were mixed with the saml; on ~11 contiguous parts the oysters were very thick. Away from the sancl shoals the beds commence to be broken up by mud sloughs, aud the oysters are found in g-roup:s, the 8ize and nnmher of the groups being inrnrsely 1m1portional to the distance from the shoal. The Kettle Hole Bed is nearer solid and uniform than the others, the rocki;i beiug larg1~r anrl closer together. The depth of w;tt~r over tlie be1ls is shown hy the chart, and the same g-eneral conditions with regard to it that were noticed on those heds already described exi8t on those now under consideration. The covering of mud over the animals was quite light, and the beds appear to receive less of the sediment in the river than those above or on the opposite side of the channel. The o,vsters were single and in small clusters. Those from the Thomas. Point Bell wne small aud of an inferior quality; those from the Kettle Hole were larger, of good quality, and with a moderate amount of wl1ite,and gray 8po:1.,;c· duging to them, and on both beds the proportion of young oyster8 of less than a year's growth to those mature was very large. UtiUy Smash 1tnd Naseway Shoal Beds.-The Bally Smash Bed lies between Goodwin Point and

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SERVEY.

Fishing Point, and about one mile off the southern shore of the river. Its.area is (approximately) 98t,OOO square yards. The Naseway Shoal Beds lie NE. of Fishing Poi11t, about the :Xaseway Shoals, and comprise an area (approximate) of 2,988,000 square yards. Hoth of these beds appear to h~tve been originally formed about the shoals, those parts of the latter that are nncm·ered at low water showing a mass of shellr; brnken and mixed with sand, and in their proximity the oystPrs are in greater uumhers than near the marg'in of the bed. The depth of water on the Ball~· Smash Bed is about 4 feet; on the Naseway Beds it is the same, except in the mml RloughR, where the depth is from (j to 8 feet. The Bally Smash appears to be an unbroken "rock,'' the hottom consisting of shells and oysters with a light covering of mud. The oysters were small arnl of the inferior quality known as "snaps." The strong current setting past aud about the bed shoulil haYP the effect of cleaning it, but the shoal, being dry at certain stages of the tide, appears to offer a barrier to the current in sucll a way as to cam1e a growth of the shoal to the nortll ward and. westward, where we found t,be largest amount of mud. TIJ.e Naseway Shoal Bed consists of a number of detaclled "rocks" separate\] h~· mml slough", except in the vicinity of the sl1oal, where the o;ysters were found in the largest 1111111 uers, au<l where the bed is comparatively unbroken. The "rocks" appear to follow the general direction of tlw shoals, and are in ridg-es and groups, scattering and becoming smaller in size as the distance from the shoal increases. The oysters were single, of all ages, and generally of poor quality, hnt iBsllore .· from the bed, where a number of small detached "rocks" known as mud and sand rocks are found, the oysters were larger and older in appearance, and the young growth was missing. The hottom on the Naseway Shoal was a thin stratum of mud and shells on tile surface, with a snhstrittnm of mud, very thick in the sloughs, alHl of hard sand alHl shell in the ''icinity of the shoals. The ~aseway Shoal Bed is supposed to recei,·e a larger amount of the sediment brought down b,v the ebb-tide than any other bed on tl1e southern side of the river. As will be seen by the chart, the Eastern Shoal runs across the direction of the current, and the water aeepens q nickl;1· to the eastwar1l of the shoal. The "rocks" lie closer to t,he shoal on the eastern side than 011 the "es tern, while the niud sloughs are more frequent on the western side than on the eastern. From the ablwe it would ap1lear that the western part of the bed recefred the larger amount of <l<'posit, and that deposit was injurious to the oysters. Brown'.~ Shoaf Red.-The rocks composing this bed lie to the northwarcl and eastward of the Nasewa:> Shoals on the northern side of the river, and are situated, as their names indica:te, on and about Brown's Shoal. The approximate area of the bed is 1,828,000 squa11e yards. The depth of water is from 3 to 18 feet, the average depth about 8 feet, and the dPep water is fomHl as 011 th.e other beds, over the mud sloughs. The bed follows the general direction of the shoal, and is not so extensively cut up as those previously described. Tl1e bottom was of shell witb a little mud, resting on a snbstrntum of shell or hard sand. The oysters were single, and in small clusterl'.l, and were not evenly distributed, being thicker on the edge of the channel, where also was found the largest number of young. The oysters hrought np ha Ying bnt little mml 011 them, and the soundings and probe discovering but a light, covering of mml, it is presm1rn!l that there is !'om1mrati vely but little deposit on the bed. The principal part of the sediment brought down on tliis side of the river is probably recei\·ed by the Thomas Point and Kettle Hole Beds, and aR we were informed that ice seldom grounded on Brown's Shoal, it, is perhaps protected by the beds from that soil also.
CRUISER'S ROCK AND NANSEMOND RIDGE.

Cruiser's Uock and the beds of the Nausemoud Ridge are situated off RaA"ged Island, on the southern side of the channel, and about the shoals extending from Barrel Point. Their approximate area is 6,925,000 square yards. The beds are similar in character to those already described, being intersecte<l b;y mud sloughs, and the oysters growing in groups and patches, but the mud sloughs are smaller and the area of the groups larger than on the other beds. The deptll of water over the rocks is from 7 to 8 feet, and the surface stratum of the bottom consisted of shells and a small amount of mud. The substratum was, on the shoal 11arts of Cruiser':.; Rock, hard and of 8and or shell; on the Nansemoud Ridge of soft mud and shell for about 5 feet. The oysters found grew in sma.11 clusters or singly, and were of inferior quality. They were not found to the north-

ward and eastward of the beds in greater <lepths than 15 feet, but exist to the eastward, :,;cattered either in small groups or singly, as far as the channel into the Nausemond mvPr. Irnshore from the maiu bt>ds are a number of small rocks an<l groups of oysters. From the character of the bottom on the Nausemoud Ridge, it is inferred that there is a tlcposit of sediment accumulating on those beds, and from which Crnisel''s Rock is free. The fact is that the position of the Nascway Shoals is :,melt· that they protect the uppel' portion of the ridge (Cruiser's Rock), while nothing interferes with tlte lower and mi1l1lle portions, antl the current out of the Nansemoud Hi 1-er supports the iuference. In a·l<lition there is a strong tide up along the Nansemond Ridge which wonhl probabl,v cause a deposit of any matter held in suspension. I was informed th:ctt these Jastnamed beds were less ex1insed to the grounding of ice aud its sulJsequent piling than any in tile riYer. Attached to the OJSters t<tken from the Nan:,iemond Ridge was a variety of sponge, red in eolor, that was subsequently fonn·l on the Craney Islaud fiats, and in large quantities iu Tangier and Poeomoke Sounds. It is not often found where there is mnch mud or sand 011 the bottom, or where the o~·sters are sea tteretl singly, and its presence is a good indication of a, solid ''rock," though its absence is not conclusi \'e as to the non-exit:;tence of the same. l~etween the Nansemond River and the channel into the Elizabeth River, aud along Craney Island flats, are numerous small bed8 of nnimportant area. They extend from the one-fathom cnrrn out to about 2~ fathoms, growing in ridges and group8 with wide spaces of mnd between them .. Tile oysters found were single and larger than any in the James RiYer. There wa8 also more red and gray sponge clinging to them than had been noticed before. The bottom was g·euer· ally of mnd and shells on the surface with, in the vicinity of the Elizabet.It River, a hard stratum of san<l and shell8 underneath, and in the vicinit,y of the Nansemond a substratum of mud. None of the beds are important and arc only fished for the local market. 'l'he practice of depositing on the Crane~· Island fiats the matter dredged out of the Elizabeth River and ~ol'folk Harbor is gradually de8troying the beds inshore, and especially those near Craney Island.
THE FISHERY AND ITS EFFECT::>.

The oysters are removed from the beds in the ,fames Hiver with the tongs alone,, no dretlgi11g being permitted, and this may accouat to some extent for the beds being ma.de up of patches and ridges of oysters. This formation is only advantageous in so much as it assists the rapidity of the current, and in all other respects it is an eYil. Beds such as CrnisP.r's Rock, Nausemoml Ridge, and Point of Sboals,~vherc the oysters in places are too thick, would be much improved liy using a light scrape or dredge instead of the tongs in the fishery. If used with moderation, the surface of the hed would be cleaned, its area extended, the animals would be more evenly distrilJute·l aud allowed more room for deYelopmeut, and the spat, having a larger and cleaner amount of" eultch" exposed, would probalily attach in greater nnrnbers. As, howernr, without stringent laws, rigidly executed, it wonld be impossible to keep the 1kedging within prow~r limits, and ai,; there is but little prospect of such a thing occurring it is perhaps better, on the whole, that dredging is prohibited. The mud 8turounding the bed8 is of too soft a character to permit a n.r great extension of the pre8ent area, and thus one of the principal advantages of using the dredge would be lost while all its Hils would be retained. Even as it is, the fishery is carried to excess, and all the beds, especially those in the neighborhood of Hampton Roads, are deteriorating.
TANGIER AND POCOMOKE SOUNDS.

The charts showing the oyster beds and limits of oysters in these sounds have heen constructed from the data collected during the progress of the work. Only the natural beds are shown on them, and no attempt was made to carry the investlgation beyond the sounds, except in the cases of the Manokin antl Big Annemessex Rfrers, where the beds were large enough to make their delineation and study advisable. The bells have been uamed from the solid '' rockR" which they surround, and are indicated on the charts by the darker shades. In many cases it was a matter of some difficulty to determine the outlines of the beds proper, ou account of their pecnliar formation. It would ha\'e given an erroneous impression to have considered either the solid unbroken portions as the beds, or to have

taken the entire area upon which oysterR are fouud, and I have therefore adopted the number of 0.1 oysters to the square yard a8 the standard by which to determine the outlines, all positions where the number foll below that standard heing exelnded from the beds, unless other circmnl'ltances have led me to a different decision. The light shades on the charts show the arna oecnpieil by sca.ttered oysters, and, as already explained, must be considered only approximate. The broken lines show areas where the oysters are wry widely separated. 'l'he dark lines hav1~ he1m tlra wn thrnug:h those positioni-; wlH're tlw numlmr of oysters to the square yard was abon' tlrn aYerag:e. In designating the oysters, tJie term ''young growth" has lJet>n applied to the small oysters that wer1· evidently but one year or one and a half years old. The term" young'" has heen applied to small oysters of the last brood that were fonuil clini.dng to the mature oysters and ol<l shells. and were, on an average, about one-half or three-qua~ters of an inch in length, or under. Tangier Sound extends north nml south, in i·onnd munbers, :{6 mile1', from \Yatts' fala111l to the head of Fishing Bay, and each side of the chauuel for 3:? milt's is lined with oyMer heds of greater or less extent.

On each side of the channels into the Xanticoke, :Jianokin, aml Big' AnnemPssex Hin·1·s, beds are found, and to a less extent in the \Yicomico and Little .A.unernessex Hh-en;. By reference to the chart. it will be seen that the only parts of the 80tm1l unoccupied by o,Ysteri-; are a short space, one mile in length, off J)eil's falarnl, a space of two milei-; north of Jane':-: h:la111l Light and !Jetween the Big aud Little A.mwmessex Hfrers, and a stretch of 21 miles on tlie western side of the souud off !~each Hammock arni the nortl1er11 part of Tangier Islautl. \Yith these exceptions, the o.rsters are to all intent,.; <·ontinnons, and the total area 1'on·1·etl h,\ them amounts to 6!1.12 square nantieal miles. The area of the beds proper, or tlrnt part of the total area 011 which tlte 1111111her of oystt~ri-; to the square yard was at least 0.1, is 1 i .ffi' square nantic~il miles.

The groups, or'' rncks." arc represented on the chart by the 1lark shades, and are forty-three in unmber, comprising: a total area of :3,GOO,OQ,O square yardi-;. The remainder of the space, 2:5,()05,000 square J·ar'il;o:, is occuph~d h~- small groups a1ul patches of oysters, separatecl hy large mud areas. The beds or "rocks'' uecomc smaller as the hl:',ad of tlw hay is approached; the~ grow about any marked shoal, and all are somewhat broken by small mud Hloughs, especially about the edge:>.

In the northern part of the !Jay the depth of water over the hnb is from 4 to 10 feet; over tbP i,;ontlte1·11 part from 8 to 12 feet; the g'Pneral 1lepth, except in the channel, is about 11 feet.

The rocks are smTonmlt>d, like thost· to the 11ortllwanl, by soft muddy bottoms, except in t,Iie case of those in the southwestern part of tlie bay, where the surrounding bottom is of sand; those beds having Rand as a substratum were less broken than the others. In the channel the bottom was inrnriably of soft, dark mud. On the northem beds of the bay the o~·stcrs were sing'le and of small size, with many of recent growth and probably about one ,rear old. Xo Rponges and but few of the usual molluscan inhabitants of an o,n;;ter hed were discO\'ered. On the extreme northern beds above Fishiug Point, where the water is shoal, the beds oltl arnl much worked, the oyst,ers are scarce, but on the other beds a very fair number were found.

It is <li\-ided about the middle by a narrow strip of sand arnl mud iuto two irregularly-shaped portions, the upper one of which hs similar in character to the Fishiug Hay bed;:, though more broken. On both portions the o,ysters grow in groups and patchc», separate1l h,Y mud and sand sloughs, the separation being more marked about the edges of the hed. <>~·i;;ters art> fouud oYer the eutire sul'face, but are not eYeul~· distributrnl, the largest 11umher Oil the southern portion bring found along its northern and eastern border. The depth of water is from !I to 15 feet, the general depth being about 11 feet. The hot tom is of oysters and :-;hells mixed with sand and mud, for ahout 2 feet, with a, substratum of soft sand or mud. \Vhere the gronps occHr the sltell stratum is \"ery tltick, but is thin over and about, the rnnd and sand spaees. Along the dark line on the chart, indicating the largest number to the square yard, the bottom i;; harder thau elsewhere. The mt11hly bottoms were fuuml principally ou the eastern awl Ronthern portious of the bed, and the bed is bouu(led in those directions b~- bottoms of a similar character, while to the we;;tward the contiguous bottom is of sand. The o_yistl·rs were single, of mo<leratc size antl fair quality; very few young and no drills were found, either on the nrnd1ly or sandy bottoms; there was no sponge or grass among the oysters, and young growth of at least 011e ~-ear pre1lominated. 'l'h~ scattered oysters near the bed were similar to those ou it, though a few small clm;ters were found to the westwa,rd. The nnmber of oysters to the square yard, as gi\·en by the meau of fourteen measurements, is l.'.!5. Ou account of the slwaluess of the water and softness of the bottom, the number is more 11early correct, than usual, but it must be remembered that iu this, and in all otbercases, wlrnre the 11mnher to the square J·arcl is gi\·en, that number 0111.r expresses" marketable" oysten1, and does not include those which would not be accepted by a dredger, or which on account of want of age are practically incapable of rt'production. Shark's Fin Bed.-Directly south of tlie Were Point Bed on the western side of the main channel alHI south of Hooper's Strait Channel, lies a lied of moderate size, but celebrated for the quality of it:s o~-ster:s, cal!Pd the Slnu·k's Fin Ifock. It is regular in shape, extelllling ESE. and ·wNW. about one mile, an<l being about one-half mile broad. Its area is about 1,867,000 square yards. Prac1 ically, it joins the Were Point Bed at the southern extremity of the latter, the space separating the beds being very small. In tile cotmie vf time through the action of natural causes and the dredges thiR space will he obliterated and the union of the beds made compleM.

The Shark's Fiu is a more compact bed than its neighbm·, though ahont the edges, especially those bordering on the main channel, tl1e oysters exist in groups, as on tht· beds alrea<ly upscribed. 'l'he animals are spread over the entire area~ but are found iu largei· 11u111lwrs about the central and more solid portions of tlle bed, and are scattered more aJ1tl more widely a8 the borders are approached. The southern limit is not Yer,Y well. deiine1l, i<cattered o~·r>ters extending farthe1· iu that direction than iu the others. 'rhe depth of water is from 8 to rn feet, thf·, gP1wral depth being about 1~ fret. The bottom is llard, consisting of o~·ster,; and shells with mrnl and sand for ahont :1 feet, and then a stratnm of soft sand or 111ud. 011 the we,.;tern part of the bed the shell stratum is mucl1 thinner and tlw substratum is hard saud. Ea,.;t of the bed the hottom, being that of the main channel, is of mud, and to the west"·ard :tll(l southward of sand. !':oft uear the hed, but growiug harder as the distance from tlw bed i11creasPs. 'rl1e oysters were single, of a moderate size and fine quality. Very few yonug and 110 drills or other euemies were diseo,·ered, but the young gnmth of leiss than a year were found in large num hers, and also a little of the red sponge ou the northern part of the bed. Tbe scattere1l oysters were similar in character to those ou tht> bed, though a larger proportion of young µ:rowth was found to the southwar<l, and the same absence of "yonng" and drills mis noticed both 011 mndd,Y and sandy bottoms. On the bed the number of oysters to the S(JUare ,vard was l.OL The number to the square yard 011 the area covered by 8cattered o~·sters west of the bet! was 0.04, east 0.03, and south 0.03. Nanticoke Jfiddle Ground Bed.-On the micldle gron11tl between the channels into the Nanticoke and ·wicomico Ri'\·ers therP is a large lwd of an area of :~,1!15,000 square yards, called the "Middle Hronnd H,ock." It extends along the cliam1el i11to the Nanticoke abou1 2;j; miles, aud its greate,st hrPadtil is three-quarters of a mile. The bed i;.: lmiken in rnaJJy places, as w-ill he st>eR on the chart, where only tbe larger di,·isions are slw\'rn, arnl the oysters grow in groups and patches of different, areas with mud sloughs separati11g- and interseeti11g tl1em in all 1lirectio11s. The whole bed is broken up in this manner, but it iR less noticeable on tlw northern and southern portions than on tlw central. The depth of water is from 8 to 21 feet, the deeper water being found alo11g the weRtern edge of the brnl, where it borders on the cham1el, bnt, as the shoal rises abruptly, the parts of the bed covered by deep water are of small extent, an<l the general depth may he considered as about 11 feet.. The he1l i:o; clearl,y llt"fi11ed h,v the chaunel of the Nanticoke on the west and the sands 011 the eaRt. 'l'lw bottom is a t11i11 layer of mud m·er a stratum of shells antl oysters from one-half foot to 5 feet in tllieknesP.. A bout the middle an<l western portions Df the bed the substratt1m waR soft mnd, wbile on the northern, eastern, and southern portions hard sand was found nndernmith the shell stratum. The hottom mi the central part of the bed in mans· places appeared to consist, of alternate, strata of slwlls and mud, aml ou tlw northern and southern parts the general character of the bottom was much harder thau on the central portio11. To the uort,hward and ea:otward of the hed the bottom was of bard sand or fine gravel, arnl probably the lowest stratum of the bell bottom, could it be reached, would be found of similar nature. South aml west of the he<l and in the channels the bottom is soft mud. Only a few oysters were found iu the chanuel into the 'Vicomico, and none in that into the Nanticoke. , The oysters were generally of an iuforior quality and small r;:ize, and gTPW sing·I,r and in small clusters, though the number of the former was comparatively small. No young were found, but many young growth, probably about one yeilr old, aml uo sponge, grass, or drills. Along· the edge of the Nanticoke Channel the shells were blackened, probabl~· by the mud. On tlie west, side of the Nanticoke Channel, north and east of the one.fathom sand shoal, there nre a few small he<ls, comprising a total area of 270,000 square yards. 'l'he depth of water oYer them is from 4 to 8 feet, and they are unbroken but separated from eaeh other by spaees of mml or snnd. On>r these spaces the depth of water increases. The bottom is a stTatum of shells, aliout one foot in thick· uess, over a stratum of sand and clay. A liglit eovering of mud lies 011 t{JP of the shells. The oysters were single, with many of a young growtl1. Many shells, hut 110 ~·onng or drills, were touud.

They are of small area, comprising collectively but :IH2,ti00 squar1· yar1ls, arnl lie in from fi to 10 foet of water; they are separated from each other b.r the muddy bottoms of thP cha1111el or slongh8. All the rocks are broken in many places, the oyster groups separated by spaces of mud all(} :-;arnl. the latter species of bottom being found principally m~ar J,oug Point. 011 the roch the hottom is of' shells and mud, with a snb~tratum of mud. Yery few oy1.ters were found 011 the hottorn8 surrounding the rocks, and those discovered grew in ,;mall gToups, the num her and size of which decreased very mueh to the eastward of Long Point. The oysters Wl'rc Yer~· sc;trcc arnl resembled those of the :Nanticoke Middle Ground in ge.neral character, though a larger unmber of single ones were found than on that bed. Hol's1w'.~ Bar mu11);ler's Rock.-These are comparati\·ely small beds, lying on the southern side of tlw SanticokP Chamwl, southwest of tlte ::\liddle. Ground and north of Haine's Point. The first hell Pxte111ls north alHl sontl1 thre1'-Pighths of a mile and east and west one-eighth of a mile. Its area is :!0:!,.100 square .rnr1ls. The secoml bed lies southwest of Horsey's Bar, and is one-half mile in length and breadth, a111l comprises an area, of 4175,000 square yards. Both beds are mi brokt·11, except about the edgl~I>, aml 011 the major portion of each lJed the oystei::s are eYenl~· 1listribntc11. Along the 11ortltern and southern boundaries, where the beds border on the channels, the o~·ster,; are found i11 group,;, ;;eparate<l hy mnd sloughs. The depth of water oYer Horsey's Bar is l:J feet, over Tyler's l:Ock from 14 to 16 feet. The bottom consists·of a stratum of shells from l to 2 foet i11 thiclrnesfl, 011 a stratum of hard sand; ou top of the shells was a light layer of mud. 'J'he oyster" were small. ;;inglt>, and of poor quality, and those of one year's growth prerlomiuatt·(l. Xo young, drills, sponges, or grass were found on the beds. J>nr mining Shoal Bnl.-This herl lips 011 and about. the shoal off Haine's Point, from which it deriws its uauw. It is 011e lllile arnl three-quarters loug and three-eighths of a mile wide, and 1·xteJl(ls in :t 11ortheasterly aud southweMerly direction along the eastern edge of the main channel of tlw sound. ItH area is :!,4:10,000 square yards. The bed is unbroken, the central arnl southern portio11s being remarkably hard and solid. About the edges, as with the other beds, it is intersected by mud sloughs, and the oysters grow in the usual groups and 'detached patches, but gen· erall~· they are evenly distributed, a slight differmtce existing in favor of the shoaler and central part of the bed l_ying 011 the Drumming Shoal. The depth of water is from 10 to 30 feet, the deeper water being found on the northeru part and along the western border. The major portion.of the bed bas but 11 feet over it. On nearly the whole hetl the bottom consists of a stratum of shells with a light covering of mud over a stratum of luml Rand. On the extreme northern part the substratum was mud, and the surface stratum of shells not so thick as elsewhere. The oysters were single and in small clusters; a moderate numlier of shljlls and a little of the red sponge was found. Inside of Drumming Shoal is a small bed called Haine's Point Uock, which has been included in the description and area given for the Drumming Shoal Bed, with which it is closely connected. Cedar Rock.-This bed lies about one-half mile south of the Drumming Shoal and comprises an area of 387,500 square yards. The depth of water ornr it is from 12 to 17 feet and in all respects it is similar in character to the Drumming Shoal Bed. On the westf'rn side of the sound, along the edge of the channel, the beds are nearly continuous from the Shark's Fin to the Terrapin Sa111ls, a distance of about 11 miles. This space was orig'inall,y divided into tliree portions, each locality having a particular designation, but at present it is difficult to define their limits, the spaces separating the beds having gradually diminished until they practically have ceased to exist. The dark lines on the chart indicate the positions where the largest numbers of o.rstArs are found, and will show approximat~ly the situation of the original unbroken "rock" from which the locality derives its name. The oysters taken from this region are known in the market as "Grass Tangiers" and have a good reputation, both for size and flavor. Tlte Cow and Calf Beds.-'l'hese are two small beds lying on the edge of the channel and south of the Shark's Fin. This area is 292 7500 square yards. The smaller bed, called the Calf~ has from

Piney Island Bar.-This bed lies south of Little Island, 011 the eastern side of the cllaunel aud on the western side of the shoal lying between the main ehanuel of the Snnud arnl thP chanuel i11to the Manokin Hiver. It extends NN,V. aud SSE. 3 milet1, arnl it1' greateHt breadth, wliich is near its southern extremity, is about one mile. The bed gradnall~- dimiuiiilH"S in size to the 11orthwar1L and at that extremity is but one~eighth of a mile wide. Its area is 6,!l75,000 square yarcls, a111l it is unbroken, with the exception of a few sand spaces in tlw southern portion a11d a >:mall er nnm ber of mud areas in the northern. About tlie extreme western border the orstPr" are ill detac11ed groups, with mud sloughs between them, and to the eastward and southward the o~·stPr" are morP widely scatteretl and scarce, until they reach the HanJ8 or soft mudcly bottoms of the eha11nel, when they eutirely disappear. The depth of water is from 12 ro 3G feet, and, general!,\· "Jlt·aking, tlie deeper water will be found on the western and the shoaler on the eastern part" of the hetl; there are seYeral holes and sloughs, howeYer, about the middle of the bed. The o.\·;;ters are uot nry evenly distributed, as will be seeu by the lines on the chart, whieh indieate !lie positiou8 of the greatest mnuber, and in the vicinity of the sa11<l and mud areas a smaller 11m11 lwr of o.\·sters were found than elsewhere. The bottom is hard, except about tlie extreme western Pdg!'~ in det·p water, and about the mud holes and sloughs situated in the northern portion. Owing to tlw depth of water the observations of the clrnracter of the hottom werP not as numerous as 011 other ht>ds, hut those that were made showed the existence of a strntum of shells and oysters of from 011e-half foot. to 4 feet in thickness, and mixed with mud and sand, m·er a stratum of hanl or soft sand, the former predominating. West and south of the bed the bottom is mud or stieky sand, the latter being found more freqnentl,y to tlie southward than westward. To the east,rnnl tht> hnttorn is hard sand. The oysters were single, of moderate size and ordinary quality. A Yery hirg(; proportion-fully one-half-were young growth. Few drills and not mauy yonug 'ven' fonnd,.and both young and drills were in greatest number8 abont the extreme southern part 1 and in lea,,:t numbers about the northern. A moderate amount of red aud gray Rponge was fomHl 011 all parts of tlw bed, and some of the sponge on the saud~· bottom8 south of it; wl1ere thP yonng· o,Ysters "·ere in greatest numbers tlte amount of sponge was least. \Vest of tht> bed Yery fe\\· oyster" wen· found, the "rock" rising abruptl:.Y from the chaunel. South aml east of the bed the o.rntPrs w1·re 8<~arce, and the amount of sponge and grass much increased. The number of os,>ters to tlw sq nan· .v:mL the mean of forty-nine ouservations, was 0.69. The number to the square yard on the area oc('npied by the scattered bysters was 0.01. Beds o.f the Manokin Ritier.-These beds lie on each si<le of the channel of the :\la11okiu Hiver and extend about 42 miles from its month. The inrnstigation extended as far as :::faint J>ierre Island, above which point only a few small "rocks," of inconsiderable area, WPre found. The bed8 are fifteen in number and comprise a total area of G,142,000 square ~·ards. Uenerally s1waking, the larger beds are on the nortliern side of the channel. By reference to the chart it will he see11 that beds of more or less area are distributed over the cut.ire rh·er bottom, beinp; SPparatl'd and intPrsected by numerous mud sloughs. The character of the indi,·idnal beds is similar, eaeh being <~nt up by mud slouglis and divided into small groups and areas of oysters, thus on a small scale rl'producing the whole rivt>r bottom. The depth of water is from S aml IO fret 011 tlu· upper beds to 27 feet on those off Hazzard's Point. In the channel tlie depth is :!;i and 80 feet off Hazzard'" Point, shoaling graduaIIy to Saint Pierre Island, where there is about la fret, thong-11 there are many deep holes and sloughs where the dept,h exceeds the aYerage. On the lieds the bottom is nr.v irregular, and the change from shoal to deep water sudden arnl frequent. GPnerally n thick stratum of oysters aud shells were found on the shoals, and where th<> water dt·t·peuc<l a large amount of mud. The oysten1 appear to be in larger numhers on the beds about the mouth of the river than elsewhere, are very thilll~- scattered in groups in the channel, and 011 the extl'eme upper beds are very scarce. The bottom .consists of a, stratum of shells allll o~·sters, from one-haif foot t.o 2 feet in thickness. On the northern side of the channel, near the sands, a stratum of hard sand is found directly underneath the shells, but nearer the channel and on its southern Ride there is an intervening stratum of mud from 1 to 4 feet thick. On the greater part of the beds the oysters and shells am mixed with mud, but in the extreme southwestern portion soft sand is found instead. Many of the bed111 in the upper part of the river are CO\'ere<l by a, stratum of mud <thout 1 foot thick, and near the southwestern border the oysters and shells were covered bJ· 3 to G inches

of sand. In rnnning lines across the river a similarity was frequently noticed in the character of the succeeding surface Rtrata to those of the bottom, as shown by the probe. For instance, in t11e channel soft mud wa" fonn<l; proceeding inRl1ore a surface of shells and mud, then one of mud or soft saud, a11tl, finally, hanl sand was encounterPCl; the bottom on the major portion of the bed is built of similar strata, arranged in re\·erse order, the hard sand being the lowest. The oysters iu the upper part of the river were siugle and in small clusters; most were young growth, and all were of inferior ·1nality. But. frw youug and fow drills were found, and no sponge or grass. On the southern heds the animals increased in size and numbers and improved in quality; a large proportion of young growth was still present, and a larger number of young and drills; a small amount of spo11ge. aml grass was fonnd. The scattered oysters in the channel and on the sands were of the same drnracter as thost· on the lJeds, but no young, drills, or sponge were. discovered. On thP extensirn sand shoal south of Piney Island there are no oysters, but much sponge and grass. The obserrntions for ascertaining the number to the square yard were made only on the southern bed;;, and consequently must not be considered as giving a just average for the whole area. On the lwds, the uurnher to the square yard, the mean of twenty.five observations, was O.!JO; on the area ocenpietl hy scattered oysters, 0.13.
BEDS OF 'l'HE RIG ANNEMESSEX RIVER.

lu this river and about its mouth, aud on both sides of the channel, are ten beds. The largest are the western one:s, 11ituated off Flat Cap Point, and from thence to the eastward the beds gradualJ.r denease i11 size. They comprise a t.otal area of _2,835,000 square yards. Though the heds are distributed O\"er the riYer bottom in a manner similar to those in the :Vla11oki11, there is little or 110 similarity in other respects, except between the western parts of the bedt' i11 the month of the river and where those farther to the eastward are in proximitJ' to muddy bottoms. Iu these eases the be·ls are broken up ~.Y slough8 aud the oysters piled up about the shoal spots much in the same manuer as in the Manokin. The beds in the month of the river, especiall.r when\ the,Y come in contact with muddy bottoms, are also broken by sloughs and the oysters separated into gTonps. Most of the beds, including nearly all in the river, are comparati n:!ly m11Jroke11. They are surrounded by sandy bottoms, and, except near the channel where there ii-; mud, s11d1 few isloughs HIS ruu iuto them are of sand. The westeru beds have from l G to 33 feet of water oYer them, and the eastern beds from 7 to 1:1 feet. Uenerally speakiug, the depth of water may be couisidered as about 14 feet. The bottom consists of a stratum, about 6 inches thick, of OJ'Sters, shells, and soft sand or mud oYer a stratum of hal'(l sand. The surrom1ding bottomi'l consist of strata of soft sand on hard sand, except in the cltamwl where the surface stratum is mud. More mud on the surface was found on the western beds than the eastern. The oysters were small, single, and in small clusters, of poor quality, and with .fow _young, aml no drills (asf,IJrifs). A small amount of sponge was found, and the oysters taken in the vicinity of the mud sloughs ha(l blackened shells. The number of oysters to the square _yard on the western beds, the mean of seven observations, was 0.56. Harri.~ Bed.-This is a large bed lyiug off :Flat Cap Point, on the eastern side of the main cl.Jannel of the Son11d, aml across the channel into the Big Annemessex l~iver. It extends north arnl south 2!! llliles, and its greatest width is a little more than one mile. Its area is 3,420,000 square J'ards. The bed is broken in many places, and is separated into four distinct portions by broad spaces of sand that intersect it. All of these portions are more or less cut up by mud or sand sloughs, and especialls the middle and larger portion, which contains within its limits several large areas that a.re occupied by scattered oysters only. The northern portion of the bed is broken by man;r mud sloughs, and the oysters grow in patches" of small area. The other portions are as represented ou the chart, the groups of oysters heing large and comparatively solid, and the se1mratiug s<t1Hl >1paces of more e-0nsiderable area than where they were of mud. As will be seen by referring to the dark lines on the chart, the oysters are nor evenly distributed, but they are found in larger or smaller numbers on the entire area. The bottom is irregular in contour, as will be noticed by reference to the depths of water plotted on the charts. Ou the northern portion the

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

No oysters were found on the soft bottoms east of the beds. Those scattered to the westwitrd were large and of good quality. Very few yonng and fewf\r drills were !Onnd; where the groups were encountered in a frw <.'a Res, a modern te nrun her of the oysters were "young growth," !mt generally there was a marke(l ahst>nce of that class. Spouges were found ou the sand iu moderate quaut.it,y. The uumber of oysters to thP square yard, tlie mean of fourteeu obsernttions, was 0.27. The number ou the area occupied by scattered o,ysters, the mean of twelve ohse1Tatio11is, wais 0.03. Paul's Bed.-Thi;; bed lies on the western side of the channel, opposite the month of the ],ittle Annemessex HinJr. It is south of the Terrapin Sands and north of a bed called the '''oman's l\larsb, with which it is eonnectell. It is similar to the latter bed, being broken in rnau_y places by mud aml sand slouglls, and with tlie oysters growiug in groups and patches. Its area is 7(i5,000 square yards. The depth of water O\'er·the bed iH from 14 torn feet. The bottom iH g·enerall,\' of sand, but many mml sloughs \Yere found. :Xo specimens were outainerl from this bed, hnt the oysters are probably similar to tltmm found on the Woman's Marsli Bed, which will snbse11nently be de8cribed. · Between I>anl'8 Bed and the Terrapin Sands, on the area covered by tile broken lines, very few oysters are found, a1Hl on the eastern 8ide of tile channel, between Harris' Beel awl the bed oft Jane's Island Light-Honse, none at all, presumably ou account of the character of the bottom, which i8 soft, shifting sand. Btd o:{f Jant?'s bland Light-Houst?._!fo the northwanl of the channel into the Little Annemessex Rh·er, aud to the ea11twanl of th"' chanuel of the Sonnd, there is a bed extending from the chauuels to aud o\·er the shoal ahont the light-house off Jane's Island. It comprises an area of 1,.'lOO,OUO square yardis, au<l is unbrokeu except al)()nt its southern and wi>stern bou11darie,;, where it joius the channels. The dl·ptl1 of water is from 17 to 47 feet, the deep water being found on the wcstcm edge and the shoal water in the viciuit.r of the light-house and shoal exteudiug from it to the Wet>tward. 'flte oysters were lUJCYeuly distribnte<l and were in hrgest numbers about the ceutr.11 portion of the bed in 3~ au<l 4 fathoms wate!'. Along the edges of the bed where it is l1roke11 the oysters are scattered in groups and are i11 smaller numlters. '£he bottom is hard and of sand and slwlls, except near the chauuels, when· some mnd was found over the hard stratum. \Vest of the Led there i8 soft mud and e:1st of it Ji;1.l'd sa1HI. Tl1e oysters were single or in clustern of two or three, the single oyster of moderate size pre<io111i11ating. The young were no more eYeuly distribull'll than the nmture oysters, Lirge uu111ber8 exiiltiug on some parts of the bed, and ver,y few on others. Those parts farthest from the drn1111el appt'ared to ha\'e the largest proportion of J·o1mg to u1atnre OJ8ters. A few spong·es aU<l sotne gr::u.;s were found 011 the northern part. of the bed. 'l'lte Great Rod.:.-On tlie eastern side of the Somal off Great Fog faland, aud south of the cba11uel into the Little A1111emessex Hfrer, lies the largest oyster bed in either Tangier or Pocomoke Sound. It is called the ''Great Rock,'' and comprises au area of 8,505,000 square yards. Its greatest le11gth is :J~ miles, and it:; greatest wi<lth, 1! miles. It is irregular in shape, and about twoth irds of its length to the southward it is (lidded into two portious. Originally the8e portions 1rP1e widely separated, ht1t, thrcrngh the action of 11atmal causes a11d the dredges, each portion has hee11 extended until wLere tlie bottom wa;; har<l the~· have becouie united, and probably iu the eour~e of time tile union will be more complete. The depth of the water over the bed can be seen by referring to the chart. The iuucr limit of the northern and la.rger bed is approximatels indicated by the 3-fatlwm euffe, aud as uo oysters were fouud in deeper water than 8 fathoms, the tll'pth of water orer the heil is, therefore, within those limits. Generally speaking, the <leeve;;t water is over tile lower part of the larger portion. The inner limit of the smaller IJOrtion of the bed i.s not as well definetl as that of the other, and sollle of the oysters on this area are found in 2 fat horns of water, aml on aud about the 2-fatbom shoal off G1·eat Fog Island. The muddy bottoms of th<> main cbnuud I.ring iu from .5 to 9 fathoms of water define the western limit of the bed, and a {foep mu<l slough which separates it from the hed off Jane's Island Light forms the northern houn1lary. The northern and western portions of tbe bed are somewhat broken, the oyste1·s growing in groups, which d.ecrna~e ill size and uum ber as the edge of the bed is approached. Similarly towards the nistern and southern limits the oyst~rs begin to scatter in groups and singly, 1:mt the main bed ma~· he considered solid, only a few mud sloughs and sand spaces of inconsiderable area. existing in

Tbe bottolll is lrnrd, of shells and sand;' the oyster,.; on the imrfaee had a small amount or mud with tht>m, the thickness of which was not uniform, but did not exceed a few inciles. As the cbannel and uorti1ern homular,\· are approached t11e bottom becomes softer and more mud is fouud; on tlie ea:,;tem and southern portious of the bed the sand increased; north of the bed the bottom is mud, to the east wanl a]](l southward, hard sand, aml to the westward, soft mml. Ou the bed itself the 1mbstratnm of tile bottom is prob· ably hard saud, lmt. owing to the great deptll of water it was impossible detiuitel,\· to ascertaiu the cilaracter of the substratum, except in a few iiwlated easeR. The o;yister8 foirnd were single, of moderate size, and good quali1y; occa,.,ioually small dusters of two or three were di:,;covert·d. Many young were found, but the,\' were not eYenly distributed, being in larger numbers about the central portion of tbe bed and decreasing as tlw P11g·es "·ere approached. On the southern and smaller portion the young were comparati,-ely scarce. A moderate 11nmher of young had eddentl~· been deRtroyed by the dredges, and large uumbers were injured by drills; m:rny drills were found attached to the oysters, and where the bottom was clean the drills were g·e11erally in direct proportion to the young, hut where the red or graJ· sponge l!r grass existed there was a marked diminution of the num her of ,votrng and a moderate diminution of the number of ast yr is. Tile ,;:ponge and grass Wt're found in conisitlerable quantities about the western and 1muthwestern e1lgt~s of the smaller portion, and to a less extent 011 the main ht>d. As the bottom became soft or nmddy, both yomig oysters and ost11ris cfomppeared. Thougl1 tlu· bed is so larg1\ aud so favorably situated for production the oysters are not very plm1tifu1, tbe number to the sq uarn yard, the mean of thirty·six obserrntions made at different points, being but O.Hi. The scattered oysters to the eastward arc much larger and fim~r than tlmse 011 the bedl'l. Tlies are siugly on the sands, the distauces separating them being proportiouul to tlH' distance of tlle oysters from tbe mai11 lwd. 'l'o the southward aud eastward tht' o,vstens are not so ti11e, especially those· iu the latter locali(\', where tliey grow on the edge of the mud, and Lan· discolored shells aml au unhealthy appearaucP. The number to the 8qnare _yard, 011 the area occupied hy scattered o~·sters, wai:; 0.04. 1'he Wonwn'~ Jforsh Red.-'l'his bed lies ou the westem side of the Sound, opposite tile Great ltock, and is next to it in size, comprising au area of G,1175 1000 square ;rnrds. It is irregular in shape, exteuds north aud south itlong the edge of the ('hann ... J for 4¥ miles, Hml ii; a little less than one.half mile uroad. All parts of the bed are broken iu nrnny places, a11d tliis is (·specially the case about the middle portion. I.. arge spaet~s of sand arnl smaller ones of mud are frequentls met, and the oyster8 grow iu groups of considerable size, separated br these spaces, except about the localit,Y of the dark line dmwn on the chart, where the bed is nearly unbroken. The depth of water is from 13 to 2'.:! feet; O\Ter the southern arnl middle parts of the bed the usual depth was about rn feet, and on the northern portiou ahout ti feet \nts found. Grnerall.r speaking, the deeper water is near the channel, lmt 011 the extreme eastern edge ot' the hed the water suddenl_y shoals, usually torn or 17 feet: and sonwtimes to as little it~ 2 fotboms. Immediately to the westward the water deepens rapidly. The ri1Ig·c is very narrow a111l 011 or near it the largest number of oysters were found; hence the dark line 011 the chart shows, approximately, its position. The shoal water is found on the western part of the bed, and the 11Pep water oYer thf' soft bottoms a1Hl mud sloughs. The oysters are spread O\'Cl' tile entire area, with the largest number along the eastern edge of the bed, where the bottom is bard, though they are scattered on~r allll about the mnd and sand spaces. The bottom was hard, of shells and sand, except where the mnd islougl1s occnrreu, when the covering of shells was very light, and the mml underneath of considernhle thiclmess. A little mud was found on the solid parts of the bed, the amouut depending upon tile distance from the channel or interior mud s1mees. Yery fow obsen'ation8 wt·re made of the suhstratnm, but it is probably of sand, the bottom to the westward being of that description. East, of the bed the bottom was soft mud. The oyst~rs were large aml singll', o<;casioually of s111all clusters and of very good quality. l\f any ~·mmg and many drills were attacl11~d to them and the old shells. The young were \Tery une\'enlJ distributed, the largest 11umber bei11g fouud ahnut the localit;y indicated by the dark line on the chart and on the bard bottoms. The drills were similarly diRtributed, being usually in proportion to the young, though exceptions t,o this rule w~re more frequent than on the

Hoth yonug· antl a.~t.iJriN were fonnd in greater uumbers on tlle soutllern portion of the bed than 011 the northern. ~-\long the eastern edi,:·e of the bed on the hard bottoms the red sponge was fou111l, and a smaller a111ouut ou the central part; very little was found where the bottom was soft, aJlll the 11t11n her of yon11g dimi11ished where tl1e amount of spouge was excessive. The number of o.ystl'rs to the i:;qnare yartl, the mean of tl1irty-two observatiollS made on different parts of the ht~d, is 0.:!4, which is so111ewhat larger than on the Great Hock, probably on aceount of shoaler water in which the dredging was tlmH>. The o,,·ster8 :-icattere<l around the bed are similar to those on it, though they grow somewhat larger ~11111 have eleaner shells. To the we;;:tward the young were present in 111oderate uum hers awl with tlw nsnal pmportion of astyri.~. Rut little sponge or grass was fo11111l i11 thi8 direction, hut to tlw south wa1·d both increased, and _young and <L~tyris disappeared. The number to tile square yard, on the area occupied by scattered oysters, the mean of Hlirtet'll 11bsen·atio11s, was 0.00. Tlwrn11!fltf11 re Bed.~.-011 the ems tern side of the 8onnd, opposite lAttle Fox lsla1{d and·south of the On·at Hock. are two beds of moderate size, called the Little Thoroughfare and Great Thoroughfan.. Tl11· an·a of tlw forml'r is 7:m,ooo R<prnre Janls, aud the area of the latter, l,fi97 ,ooo square yards. The depth of water m·er the Little Thoroughfare is from 15 to 34 ft>et, the deep water being fon11cl on>r the westem and southwestern portion and shoaling from thence gradually to the northward aud eastwai·d. (her the Great Thoroughfare the depth is from rn to ;j4 feet, the deep watt·r hl'i11g fo11111l orr tire WPHtem and northwestern edge of nm bed and o;hoaling to the southward and eastward. Tlw space SP[HU'ating· tile be<ls i8 about one-fourth of a mih~ wide, and has o\'er it a tlt'11tb of watt'!' from 20 to 40 fed. The hed8 are uubroken except about the edges, where the o_ysters i1rP SL\arteretl. On the "estPrn side of the Great Thoroughfare, where the hed extends to the .1-mft muddy bottoms, tl1e mmal detacl11nP11t of the 0;1·8ters into groups is noticeable, but about the other boundarie..;, wlwre th(· bottom is hard sand, the oy:-;ters are distributed more thinly and the breakage 11ot <lii:;linguitdmble. The distribution of oyKters was more even on the Great Thoroughfarp than 011 the Littl·' Thoroughfon· bed, the largest number on the latter bed being found ou the W(·8tern part, while 011 the fornwr the largest number was about the central portion. The hottolll 011 hoth bmls is hard, cousistiug of a :-itratum of shells aud oysters 1 or 2 feet thick, over a stratum of saml. Very fe\v obsen'ation:-; of the character of the substratum were made, the depth of water being too great to permit it, but as the bottom as far as the channel was hard, and large uumhers of shells and oyster8 were bro.;ght nv from the westflrn border, it is probable that the shell stratum continue8 a8 far a8 the muddy bottoms. 'l'lre OJSters were of moderate size, usually single, but occasional1;1· in small clusters. Large nnmhert' of ~-oung were f'omul 011 the extreme northern part of the Little Thoroughfare and on the central and western portions of the Great 'fhoroughfare bed, while very few young were found on the eaHtern part of the latter. Some of the young had been destroyed by dredges and a few hy drill8, though not many "f the latter (tisty~·i8) were discovered. A small amount of sponge and grass was found about the t>dges of the beds. The number of oysters to the square yard, on the Little Thoroughfare, the mean of nine observations, was 0.14. On the Great Thoroughfare, the nwan of t.en observat.ions was 0.11. On the area occupied by sca.ttered oysters, the number to the square yard, the mean of seven observations, was O.OJ. The Cnl~fornia Bed.-This bed lit~s on t.be eastern side of the channel, opposite the thorough· fare into Pocomoke Sound, aml south of the Great Thoroughfare bed. It extends in a north and sontlr direction ahont 3 miles, and is Yery irregular in shape. About the center it is divided by a rnnd 8lough 01w-eightb of a mile wi<le. The area of the bed is 3,915,000 square yards. Along the wt>stern part of the bed ruus a narrow ridge, which iR comparatively unbroken and appears to be the origi11al of the bed defined on the. chart. To the eastwrtrd of this ridge the stratum of oysters and shells is thinner, though the shells and oysters are spread quite e\·enly, diminishing in numbers as the t'dge of the lwd is approached. West of the ridge and also in the vicinity of the dividing mud slough, the bed h~ Lroken into detached groups of oysters and shells. 'l'he depth of water is from 17 to :m feet, the deepe1>t water being tound on the northwestern and western parts of the bed. Except about the western border, the bottom is bard. Only a few obser\'ations of the cbaract,er of the bottom could be roade, either on the bed or in its vicinity, the depth of wat.er being

This iM minimum

By consulting the table it will be seen that the state of the tide has but little influence upon the dem;ity, though the depth of tlie water has, arlll tlie pre\'alence of strong wiuds may increase

or diminish it. There is shown a giadual and constant increase of density as the southern portion of the 80111111, whrre it opens upou the Che.-;apeake, is approached. There is also an increase of 1leusity when in the viciuity of tlw openings into the bay, a1Hl a decrease in the rnrious rivers and off their months. Though the demiity of the water iucrea~;es, yet the difference between the maximum and llli11im11m de111:1ity steadily decreases to the Ronthward, s11owiug that the o~·stel'S on the northern heds are exposed to greater fluctuations of density, and probably salinity, than those. on the beds to the southward. There were 110 heavy rains during my stay in the Sounds, aud the densities given therefore show onl~- the eouditiou of the water in that respect during dry weather. I was informed that there wa.- it noticeable change in its character about the moutbs of the tributaries of the Sounds after a beay~· rainfall, and the effect upon the oysters was also perceivllble. The ditl:el'ence hetwee.n the maximum and minimum density of the Sound amounts to 0.0053; but the difference between the maximum and minimum density on each bed will give a more correct idea of the changes to which the oysters are exposed. '.l'he greatest difference is 0.0025, which occuril on the Shark's Fin an<l Fishing Bay Beds, and the least difference on an_y of tile main beds is 0.000!1 011 the Little Thoroughfare. It would he perhaps still more correct to divide the Sound into several parts and consider the fluctuation of densit,y O\'er them, thereby assembling a larger number of observations.

tions affecting the other beds, and inclu<liug all those south of Clay Island as far a::1 Piney Island bar, where the influence of the Manokin au<l Aunernesscx Rivers woul<l be folt 1 the dift'c1·ence of density amounts to 0.0028. The difference of densit,,von\r the heels son th of Little Islaml and north of Little AnnemessPx River is 0.0031. 'fhe difference of the beffa south of .lane's hland Light is 0.00'.!0. These differences show that the greatest fluctuation is OYer the beds in the middle of the Sound, and is probablJ· due to the iutluence of the Hig Aunemessex and .Manokin 'Ri\·ers and the waters entering b,v Ke<lge's St.rait. Throughout the Sound there is a marked difterence between the densities of the water taken about the latter part of August autl the first part of September and those takeu iu October.

The earlier observations show the least. density. It will he seen by the table tliat the observations wert' made at from two weeks to six weeks apart; that, genera.llj' speaking, tl1e amonnt of difference in the densities increases with the interval between the observations, and that the northern be1h; and those in the riYers are exposed to greater fluct.nations of density thau thic' neighboring ones iu the Sonml. If the change of density o\·er tl.te beds, as shown hy these tables, represents with approximatl' accuracr the change of salinity of the water, the fluctuation is too slight to seriousl,r affect the bells or oy~ters; but if the slightness of the change is due to organic matter held in solution b,\· tbe waters of the ebb tide, which would replace the salt of the tlood, there may be a much greater difference in the salinity of the flood and ehb tfom lms l>een indicated by the hydrometer.

The general set of the currents iu the Souutl is north and sonth, following the 111ai11 cha nnt>l and diverging slightly ahont. the mouths of the tributaries and straits. In the following statements regarding the currents tlw iutltwnce of the wind has uot been eliminated, and accouuts for many irreg·nlarities, both of velocity and direction, a11tl ahont slackwater, especially of the wind ward tides, this intlnence was most apparent. In l<'i8hing Bay the currents follow the general beud of the shores and dia1111el, setting· o\·er the lower portion, on the flood, to the northward; over tl.te middle portion to the northward and westward, as far as Fishing Point, aud above that point and on·r the Ullper part of tl.ie bay, setting to the north ward and eastward. The maximum observed vdocits of the flood. current was 0.38 of a mile per hour. The ebb in each portion li*f the hay sets in au opposite direction to the flood. The currents about the northern part of the "\Vere Point bed were measured .during and after strong northeast winds, which accounts for the set to tlie southw(lrd nud westward, and also for the slight velocity of the ebb, which was only 0.15 of a mile per hour, the uortheast wind haviug lasted for twc days and having driven a good ueal of the wa.ter out of Fishing Bay.

The observations of the strength of the flood current made on this bed wern too rnucl1 influenced by the wind to he conRidered reliable, but the \'elocity imme<liately south of the hed was O.;> of a mile 1wr hour. 'l'he cnrreuts of the Nanticoke Channel awl over the adjacent beds set to the northward and eastward on tlw flood, following· the bend of the channel, with a maximum velocity of 0.6 of a mile per lwur. The d>h o\·1·r the major portion of the l\fo.ldle Ground sets to the sout.hward, with a Yelocit.y of 0.3 to OA of a mile per hom· on the first quarter, uutil it meets the current of the Wicomieo, when it turns to tlrn ''e,;tward. A strong current sets in and out of Rock Oreek; over the Drumming Shoal arnl Cedar Rocks the current sets NNE. on the flood, with a velocity of 0.4 of a mile per hour, arnl SS \Y. on the ebb tide, with a velocitr of 0.6 of a mile per hour. Over the lwds south of the Slrnrk's Fiu and Ce1lar Rock, arnl north of l'iuey Island bar and Kellgc's Straits, the g·eueral set of the flootl is to the northward, with an inclinahon towards Holland's Straits wheu about Turtle Egg falaud, and tending to the northward and westward oft the Little Thorou~hfare. T!Je geueral set. of the ebb while in the channel i,; to the southward, but on the Turtle }Jgg J;;laud, :\Jud aIHl J\Iusele Hole Beds ,the set is to tlrn southward aml eastward. The strength of these and all currents in the Sound is mqch influenced by the winds that ha\'C prevailed during the immediatcl,v preceding days, and which it was impossible to eliminate in the space of time con~n·1l by this investig;ition. Ornr the westem beds, above Kedge's Straits, tlie maximum obsern·.l n~locity of the flood was 0.8 of a mile per hour, and a mean of all the velocitil's of the ttood <mrTe11t wm; 0.4 of a mile pPr hour.

The rnaximnrn velocity of the ebb was 1.0 mile and the mean velocity 0.5 of a mile per honr. Tlie flood cnrrcnt over Pi11c~- Island bar sets NNW., or about in general line with the Sound at that point. It" ,·e)oeit,\· 011 the third quarter, during aU<l after northerly breezes, wa11 0.1 of a mile au hom, aml probably it is seldom less than that.

The maximum velocit,Y of the ebb duriug am! afkr u01therl~· breezes was 1 mile per hour and the mean of all observations, taken under similar circnmstauces, p;i1·es a velocit~' of OA of a mile per hour. Ill the )[anoki11 River the curreut follows the general trend of' the channel, the flood setting to the nortl11nml until above Hazzard's Point, and then to the northward and eastward. The ebb sets southwest, arnl, wlieu it strikes the shoal oft' Piney Island, currns somewhat to the southwar1l. The curre11ts wern measnn~!l dnriug- light or gentle northeasterly breezes. The maximum velocity of the flood was 0.4 of a mile per hour and the mean of all the ''eloeities of the flood 0.2 of' a mile per hour. The maximum velocity of tile ebb was 0.5 of a mile per hour and the mean veloeit,v 0.2 of a mile per hour. In the Big Auueuie.ssex RiYer the current sets to the eastward on the flood tide aud to the westwar1l 011 tlw ehb, curving to the southward on the latter as it approaches the mouth of the rin·r. 'fhe maxinrnm velocity of the flood current was 0.4 and the mean velocity 0.25 of a. mile per hour. Of the ehh the maximum nilocit~' was 0.5 :ind the meau velocity 0.33 of a mile per bonr. The tlornl current sets ornr Harris Hock to the northward with a maximum velocity of 0.33 ai11l a meau velocity of 0.2 of a mile per hour. Tlie ebb, being somewhat influenced hy the cur· rent out of the A1111emessex and the sweep of the main current of the Sound, sets to the southward and westwarll, with a mean velocity of 0.2 of a mile per hour. The maximum velocity observed wall but a slight increase of the mean. Ove1· the 'ferrapin Sands the flood set8 nol'thwest, with a maximum velocity of 0.9 and a mean velocity uf 0.7 of a mile per 4our. The ebb sets southeast until near the buoy marking the shoal, where it turns to the southward. Its maximum velocity was 1 mile and its mean \'elocity 0.9 of a mile per hour. Tbe currents over the Terrapin Sands were measnretl during spring tides, and after Iip;ht breezes and calms had prevailed for several days. · Over the Woman's M:arsh Hm1ks the flood sets about NNW. until in the vicinity of HQrse Hammock, where it turns to the northward and eastward. The ebb sets SSW. over the upper part of the bed, and to the southward and eastward over the lower. There is a strong set in and

out of the ope11ing between Tangier ancl Smith's Islands. The maximum \'elocity of the tlood wais 0.7 and the mean velocity 0.6 of a mile per hour. The Yelocity of tlte ebb was, maximum 0.8 ancl mean 0.4 of a mile per hour. These currents were also measured during spring tides. Along the eastern side of the Sound, below Jane's Island Light and over the several bells located on the eastern e{lge of the channel, the general set of the cul'rent is to the northward 011 the flood and to the southward on the ebb. The flood sets a little to the eastward or westward of north as the channel changes in direction, and about the northern part of the Great H.oek sets strongly to the northward and eastward into the Little Annemessex. The ebb current out of that rfrer forms a strong tide rip where it joins the main current due east of ,Jane's Island Light aud on the northern part of the bed off that light. The general set of the ebb is the re\'erse of that of the flood, and both currents follow tbe trend of the channel. Througl1 the Thoroughfare, opposite the Ca.lifornia Rock, the flood sets east iuto Pocomoke on the fir8t three quarters, and we8t 011 the last quarter. On the ebb the set is we8tward on tbe first tl:rree and eastward on the last quarter, and this irregularity is communicated to some exteut to the waters over the California Rock. The maximum rnlocity of the flood current on the eastern side of the Sound, below the Little Annemessex~ was 0.3 and the mean velocity was 0.2 of a mile per hour. The maximum of the ebb was 0.8 and the mean 0.7 of a mile per hour. Most of these currents were measured during northerly wimls, which would increase the ebb and diminish the flood currents, and probably t.hey are more equal than the obser\'ations slww tht>m to be. Over the Oak Hammock Rocks the flood sets to the northward and westward, and the ebb to the southward and eastward, with a rnlocit,v of from 0.1 to 0.2 of a mile per hour. Reviewing the cnrreuts, it will be seen that the strongest on both tides were those over Terrapin Sands during the spring tides, their velocity beiug about oue mile per hour. As the observations over the Sound were made during various states of the weather and of tide, the highest velocity 01 ·tained is probably as great as evn sets oyer any uf the beds. The veJocit.v, except within wide limits, however, is not so importaut to the oysters as the direction of' the current, and that has been ascertained with, I hoRe, sufficient exactness to assist, so far as it can: in the study of the beds.
DEPOSIT.

It would require a much longer period of observation than was at onr dil;posal, and a much
more extensive and careful investigation of the character of the water and bottom of the Sound

than I was enabled to make, to allow me to speak with authority or exactness upon this subject; but from the information collected from the most intelligent of the osstermeu whose experience ou the beds was considerable, I am of the opinion that there is little or no s~·stematic df1posit going on upon an.Y of' the beds of the main Sonnd. There must be some sediment containl:'d in the waters of the riYert> and creeks, but it appears to be depositell on those beds near their months. In the upper t.lart of Fishing Bay, ou the Clump Point Rocks, l\liddle Ground of the N:rnticoke, in the Manokiu and Big .Auuemessex ){ivers, there is a larger amount of rnnd in the surface and underneath than elsewhere in the Sound. Those beds lying in deep water are particularly free from an undue proportion of mud on the hottom, the shoalest beds having the thickest mud covering. If there was a constant and increasing deposit upon the beds they would long ago haYe dis· appeared, 01· at least have become of much smaller area, but the reverse is the case, the beds increasing in area constantly. They are, howe,·er, exposed to one species of deposit which is ''ery injurious. Heaxy gales ocourring in winter and summer fre1Jueut.ly tear up the large quantities of grass, sea-weed, and sponge on the sand shoals about the ~onn<l and deposit it upon the beds. If this occurs in summer, when there are a smaller number of dredgers at work, the effect is very injurious, the "cultch" being covered, and the young, if spawned, smothered by the grass, weeds, sand, and mud which it oolloots. The California Rook, Piney Island bar, and Manokin beds are those most su~jeet to this evil. The gales also have the eftect of covering the scattered oysters on the leeward sands, which s. Ex. 49--38

298

REPORT OF THE SUPERIN'.fENl>ENT OF THE

process is called "sanding," and, from wbat I could leant, appears to 'be a very injurious one. The oysters are buried, anrl the bottom becomes smooth and hard. "Where at least thirty bushels of oysters could be taken previous to a gale, not one oyRter eoul<l he fournl subsequent to it. 'l'he winter gales have the greatest effect, owiug probably to their greater se\'erity, and direction, which iis from the northward aucl westward. The "isar1d'' oysteris are found in largest numbers on the eastern shore8 of the Sound, and about Kedge's and Hooper's Straits; consequently they would feel a 11orth westerly gale much more tilan 011e from the opposite direction. They are said not to re· ~mver from the "sanding" for i"lenral months, a,nd upon their reappearance are noticeable 011 account of the whiteness of their shells. Though there were several Yery heav~- blows while we were i11 the Sound, they were not of sufficient severity to produce tile eflect spoken of, and if they had been 1 should not have been able to detect it, on account of the :;hallowness of the water iu which the i-;cattered oysters lie, which 11revented the schooner's dredging for them.
FJPFECT OJ;' GALE8 ANH ICE.

·

As there was no opportunity for me to investigate this question in person, the examination of the heels having been accomplished during- the summer and autumn months, the following infor111atio11 iii derirnd from the queriei-; put to the oystermen and persons inhabiting the shores of the Sound. The heaviest galel'l duriug the winter season are from the northward and westward; during tlw summer st·ason, from the southward, and southward and eastward. 'L'he gales from the eastward, sonthwar<l and eastward, au<l southward, cause au increase of depth over all the beds, amounting Hometimes to 2 feet, and the northerly and westerly gales a contrary effect, hut"not sufficient to leave any of tile natural beds uncovered, except one or two small patcheA in FiAhing Ba,t. !Tales from any direction cut away considerably the leeward sbores and points, especially when the~: are of a sand~- nature. 'l'hose parts of the Sound suflering most in this respect are Bishop's Head, Haiues' Point, and Diel's Island, fattle Island, the shores about and near .Jane's Island Great Fox Island, the shores about Horse Hammock, and the southern part of Watts anrt Tangier Islands. Coll Harbor, in Tangier Island, is said to be filling up with the washings of the sandspit to the southward. Though it is said the amount washed away from these poi.9tS is considerable, no additional deposit was ever noticed on the beds, nor did the gales appear to afle.ct them in any way other t.Iian has already heen described, except in conjunction with the ice in the winter. Ice ne,-er rests upon the main beds except in a few isolated cases where there happens to be a very shoal spot on the bed; as, for instance, occasionally the ice will ground on some of the small rocks in Fishing Bay and once in a while on the Woman's l\farsh, but not often. The injury done the o,ysters by the grounding depends upon the length of time the oysters are in contact with the ice. If it only touches in a few places not much harm is done; indeed, it is supposed to protf>_.ct the majority on the bed by covering them, but where there is a contact all over the "rock," the oysrers are killed in a short space of time. The number "Of points iu the Sound where it is possible for the ice to rest is inconsiderable, and not many of the animall! are destroyed by tbe grounding of the ice, though they are affected seriously by its long cont.inned presence. The winter gales break up the ice fields and pile them up in immense masses on the leeward Hhores and over the adjacent beds. The Shark's Fin Bed sufferi,; particularly in this respect. A good deal of damage is doue to the 8hores by the ice, and the o;ysters feel the effect, showing it by becoming what is called "winter-killed," or poor and weak, having a slimy, sickly appearance when opened. Many die on the beds from this cause, and after the disappearance of the ice ten days or two weeks must elapse before they are tit for marketable purposes. Ordinary cold weather and a moderate amount of ice is said to improve the fishing, the oysters ap11earing to be drawn more to the surface of the bed and the shells to sink more toward the bottom. My informants said this effect was quite noticeable. No one that I was able to interrogate had ever seen an oyster frozen in the water, and the impression was that so long as the oysters WP.re covered they would recover from ill effects of ice or ordinary cold weather.

l>OCOMOKE SOUND.

2H9

Pocomoke Sound extends from \Yatts' falaml in a north-northeasterly direction 12~ miles. Tlie main channel is narrow with a var_ying depth of water, the main body of the Sound being· covered by shoals with from 7 to 18 feet of water OYer them. r.ong sand-spits make off from most of the poiuts and islands and separate the channels into the different crf'eks from each other. The Sonnd iR about 9~ miles broa!l from Rhore to shore abont its middlf1, but the channel occupie,; only ll miles of this space. The change of depth is gradual, except bet\rnen \Ya.tts' and Beach Islands, miar thP son thern extremity of the Sound, where the elrnnge from deep to shoal water is sudden. About the upper and 11ortheastern portion the 1lepth is more uniform, the deep channel shoaling to about 12 feet, and that tlepth being bnt slightly diminii;hed close to the snores. Tlle beds do not, as in Tangier Sonntl, cover tile shoal;,; ou each side of the channel, the majority being fouud 011 the eastern side, and only two beds to the westward of that part of the cha1111el where the water is deeper than three or four fathoms. The total area covered h~· oysters, to a greater or lesser exk.nt, in this Sound is :~4.1:! 8tJIUU't· nautical miles. This ltrea it> that inclosed on tile chart by the boundaries of scattereu oystPrs, and is bnt approximate, as previonsl;y explai1H1d. The solid beds, comprising all parts of the 8ountl where oysters were. found in a greater unmber than 0.1 to the. square yard, or where tlw hed was found to be to all i11te11ts i,;:olid '·oyster-rock,'' or comparati\·ely unbroken, embrace a total area of 4.52 square nautical miles. The groups or rocks are not always contiguous, being: frequently separated b,v the channels into tlie different creeks aud rh'ers arnl by mud sloughs and spaCl'S, aud in only oue case ham the heds extended acros:-; a channel, and peculiar circumstances account for that exception. (l-enerally speaking, they will 'be found to lie on each sitle of the main channel in tlw Sound and on ea.ch side of the chanuelis into the ri,·ers. Taking them in order from the mouth of the Pocomoke HiYer to the entrance of the Sound, there are seventeen of a sufficient size to jnsti(Y a separate comdderation and name; and I have called tltem bj' the names given b~· the local oystC'l'rnen to the solid "o.yster-rock," which was probably the origi11 of the bed. The,y are: 'l'he Old Hocks and New Plantation Rocks, Buoy Rock, Potter·s Rock, Slatestoue Flat Rock, Dog Fish Bed, Drum Bay Point Bed, Trevise'i; Bed, Shell Bed, Buoy Spit Bed. l\fo<lcly "Marsh Bed, Bird Bed, Hern Island Bed, Heach lslantl Hed, Parker's Bed, and Brig Bed. In considering and describing the beds I shall separate the first ten from the othets, and, a!'< they ar·e subjected to very similar comlitious of bottom, current. and density of wat(lr. shall treat them under one head, as t.he Pocomoke beds.

The area covered b;v scattered oysters is det.ermiued onl~· approximately, it being Yery difficult to accurately define the limits. (}enerall,Y speaking, the one-fathom cnrve will nearly mark thP inshore limit, while the soft. muddy bottom of the maiu chanuel will define the outer oue. The depth of wat.er over the scattered oysters and the character of the bottom can be ascertained b;\reference to the chart. No oysters were found iu the deep clnurnels nor on the shoal sand-spits. Tile oysters are scattered singly awl iu groups, but usually grow singlr, though unmbers of small heds of a few hundred yartls arm1 are included within the limits of scattered oysters. In the vicinit~- of the i'\f essongo and Guilford Creeks the oysters seem to be scattered in that manner, the spaces between the group:; being proportional to their sizes. Ver~· few oysters were found along the edge of the shoal on the western side of the channel south of the :Muddy Marsh. In the ehann6l itself no oysters were found. Opposite Beach Island~ in from thil'teen to fourte.en fathoms, a few clams and shetl6 were brought up. In this case, bowever, the bottom was of hard sand. The area covered, to a greater or less extent, by the scat,tered oysters comprises 122,117,000 square yards, or 29.60 square nautical miles. The numher of o;n;;ters O\'er this area, as nearly a;;: I could ascertain, was about 0.12 to the square yard. Pocom<>ke Beds.-Across the mouth of the Pocomoke River lie the "Old Rocks," comprising an area of 1,057,000 square yards, and marking the limit to which the oysters of the Sound extend, only few small rocks being fouml in the river. Below the "Old Rocks,"1)11 the western side of the

300

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

channel, are the Buoy Bed, comprising three "rocks" and 967,000 square yards; Potter's Bed, of seven ''rocks" and 900,000 square yards; Dog Fit-ih Bed, of 720,000 square yards; Flat Bed, of 742,000 square yards, and Trevise's Bed, of 6\n,ooo square yards. On the southern side of the channel, and extending from it to the sands, are the Old Plantation Berl, of 180,000 stpiare ;yardR; the Slatestone Red, of HG7,000 square yards; the Drum Bay Point Bed, of 337,000 square sards, aud the Shell Bed, eomprisiug five "rocks" and an area of 1,102,000 square yanls. The depth of water over the beds can be seen and studied by referring to the chart. The average depth is from 8 to 12 feet at low and from 11 to 11'.i feet at, high water, the deeper water being found near the channel anrl O\'er the murl slonghs. Of the diffnent beds the "Old Hocks,'' New Plantation, and Buoy are iu the shoal<>st water, and the Shell Bed in the deepest. The channel has 27 feet off the Shell Bed, and shoals gradually to 10 and 11 feet off the Buoy Bed. None of the beds are solid or unbroken; those approximating to that condition are the "Old Rocks," New Plantation, Bno)·, and Slatestone Beds. The ID<ljority of the beds h:we been cut up by the dredges or mud sloughs into small groups and ridges, with O,\ sters scattered between them. The divisions, howe,rer, are too small to be shown on the chart. The bottom generall.r consists of mud, and the stratum is both softer and thicker in the vicinity of the channel than elsewhere. On the beds remote from the channel bard bottom was occasionally found, and near the one-fathom curve sand and gravel; the last character of bottom was sometimes found in deep water, but not frequently, exct'pt about Trevi:m's Bed and near the sand shoal, to the southward and weAtward of Ape's Hole Creek. Between that creek and Merem· scot Creek, to the eastward, the bottom is a mixture of 1:m11d and clay, and the locality is therefore a f:worite planting ground, as is .A.p1,'s Hole Creek and the light above the "Old Rocks." On the Oltl Hocks we found the surface stratum of shells, oysters, and mutl to he about one foot thick, and the substratum of soft sarnl or mud. In the vicinity of the bed the hottorn is similar, except that the substratum is of shell. On the New Plantation Bed the surfaee stratum was of sand and shell, 3 foet iu thickness, and the substratum hard sand. The Buoy Bed has a light covering of mud and tine sand on the shells and oysters, and a substratnm of hard sautl a11d shell. In the vicinity of the bed the bottom is soft murl. On Pottel''s Bed the surface stratum was of sand and shell, 1 foot thick, m'er a stratum of soft mud. In one case ou the "rock" most remote from the channel the substratum was hard sand. Within the area north of Potter's Bed, occupied by scattere(l oyster11, the bottom, with one exeeptiou, was of mud over a stratum of hard sand. On the 8latestoue Be(J the surface stratum is of mud and shells, from 1 to 5 feet in thickness, over a stratum of sand, or sand aud clay. Ou the Dog Fish and Flat Beds we found a surface stratum of sand, mud, shells, and oysters 2 or ;3 feet thick, and underneath that a hard stratum. About these two beds there are several places where the substratum was a mixture of sand and clay, similar to the bottom of the 11lauring grounds. .A.bout and inshore of the Drum Bay Point Bed the bottom was of saml anll gravel on the surface, with clay or sand aud gravel underneath. 'l'he probe was uot used on this bed nor 011 Tre,-ise's Bed, but about the latter the bottom is of soft sand for a few feet aud then hard sand. South of TreYise'11 Bed, uear the channel~ the bottom is of mud. The Shell Bed tleriYes its name from the character of its bottom, which cou11ists of a stratum of shells about 11 feet thick, over a st.·aturn of mud of from 1to4 feet in thickness, after which the bottom appears to be hard. In the vicinity of the bed the bottom is of saml, which becomes harder as the distance from the bed increases aud the water shoals. In the chanuel the bottom is soft mud, and no oysters were fmmd iu it. Within the lines defining the limits of the scattered oysters the animals are distributed, but very une\'enly so. E\·en on the heds the distribution is by no meaus regular, or likely to become so, the production aud growth of the oysters varying with the locality, aud the size, coutour, and chamct~r of each bed continually changing from the action of' uatuml causes and the constant fishing.. Throughout the area a~signed to sca.ttered oysters, many small lumps and pafuhes may be found; but gt>neraJly the OJ'Sters are Scattered in small C}USOOrll Of singly, and those 00 the beds are of the same geueral clia.racter, being small, single, or in clusters of two or three, and without parasites or parasitic attachments. There was a remarkable abst'nce of young oysters of less than six mouths' growth, even, rui in the case of t,be Shell Bed, where the bottom was clean and shelly,

and apparently in good condition for attachment. Generally the mature oysters were scarce, though many shells were found, and on the Shell Bed the number to the square :vard was as small as 0.015, though great quantit.ies of broken shells were brought up. The ~latcstone and Drum Bay Point Beds appeared to be in best condition, so far as to the number of oysters. Buoy Bp-it Bed.-This heel lies on the eastern sicle of the chanuel, soutl1 west of the Shell Bed aml opposite the Muddy Marsh Bed. Its area is 427,000 square yards. lt extends NNvY. and SSE. five-eighths of a mile, and has an average breadth of one-quarter mile. The depth of water over it is froin 14 to 19 feet~ the shoal wat,(',r being found 011 tlie Routhern part of the hetl and the deep water on the northern part, and near the channel. The bed is com11aratively unbroken, except about the edges, where the oysters grow iu groups separated by mnd sloughs. Appareutl_v the bed is very old, the stratum of shells beiug very thick. The OJster1' are eveul.Y dhltribute1l over the eutire area. The bottom consists of a stratum of shells, o.ysters, aud mud. about 3 feet thick, over a stratum of hard sand and shell; on t.he southern part of the bed the snhstratum is mud. In the vicini1y of the bed the bottom is soft saml or mml, the latter being found in the channel. The oysters were single, with very fow young att<tched; a moder11te amount of red sponge was found. No oysters existed in the channel. Those scattered near the bed were to the eastward. They were similar in character to those on the bed, but a larger number of ,roung· were found, and about one-third of them had been injured by the drills . .Muddy Jfan1h Bed.-This bed is on the western side of the channel, opposite the Buoy Spit Bed, and compriRes an area of 1,912,00.l square yards. The main bed is loug and narrow, exteuding miles alw1g the ed~e of the channel, and being on au aYerage about one-quart.er of a mile broad. Une-half mile to the northward of the main bed are two detached "rocks," whose area has been included in that just girnn. The dPpth of water ornr the bed, as will be seen uy the chart, is from 11 to 17 feet; the small "rocks" have from rn to H feet o\·er them. The shoalest water found was about the central portion of the principal bed, and the ridge marks, approximately, the original o_yster "rock." From this ridge the water deepens s1ightly to the westward and consitlerabty to the eastward. 'fhe bed is comparatively soliil, ha,-ing few mud or sand sloughs in it; about the shoal ridge it is entirely unbroken. The oyster8 are spread nneYenly m-er the entire area, tile smallest numlJer being found on the shoal, unbroken, central part~ and the largest uumbn about the extreme ends of the bed, where the water was deeper and the bottom softer. On the small beds to the northwt>.rd the oyste~s were scarce, an!l many clams were found. The bottom on the two detached "rocks" consists of a stratum of shells and mud ornr a stratnrn of mud. To the southward, and between them and the main bed, the bottom is of hard sand and broken shells. Where the beJ.s approach the channel tbe bottom is softer, and in the chanuel only soft mud is found. A few mud sloughs and mud patches were discovered at some distance from the channel, but generally the surrounding bottoms are hard. Ou the main bed a w~ry th~ck and hard stratum of shells, with a little sand on the surface, composes the bottom. \Ve could drive the prohe dowu 1;ome 2 or 3 feet, but did not in any case penetrate the shell stratum, except on the southern portion, where the bottom is neither so bard nor so shelly as about the c~nter of tile bed. South aud west of the bed the bottom is sandy, and hardens as the water shoals. A ft.ow mud sloughs were found along the western edge of the bed, but it. is noticeable that on the principal part of the bed there was little or no mud, and that the bottom was fairly cle m. The oy8tet·s on the bed and from its vicinity were of II\.edium size and fair quality, single, a11d yery scarce. Ver.r few young, no young growth nor drills, and no sponge, grass, or parasitic attachments of any kind were found, but an immense amount of broken shell and other dibri.~ was brought up by each ha.ul of the dredge. On one occasion the dredge filled in three minutes; sliells and one o.vst.er resulted. A similar haul produced a dredge full of shells and five oysters. As the dredge hel!l about two bushels, the percentage of debris is thus shown to be enormous. The haul:; were ma.de Olil the shoal, solid portion of the bed, where, according to most experience, the ossters shOllld have been mOl:lt numerous. The number of oysters to the square yard, from obsen'ations in the1<e places, was 0.40. - Tlie Bird Bed.-This bed lies on the eastern side of the main channel and across the channel into Messongo Creek. It is irregular in shilpe, and is the largest betl in Pocomoke Sound, having an area of 3,285,000 square yards. The southern extremity joins the Hern Islancl Bed, thus

practically making the two beds one; but as the oyRters were not very thick in the channel int-0 Guilford Creek, the original dividing Bpace, and as the two beds still retain M1eir original names, I have considere(l them separately. The depth ot w:tt,er over the Bird Bed is from 14 to 24 foot, tlw deep water beiug. fonnd uear the charuwl and the shoal near the Sftnd spits. The bed is unhroken, except about the edgrs; that portion indicated on the chart by the dark line iR less brol·en thau the remainder, and probably in that ,·iciuits was located the original "rock" from which the be<l has exten1led. Abont the westeru edge tl1e bed is broken by mud sloughs, and immediately to tl1P eastward of the bed numerous small, 1letached gronps of o~·sters are found ancl a fow small beds, wlrn;,e area has been included in that given for the Bird Bed. The oysters, though fonml over the entire area, are not evenly distrihuted, but exist in larger numbers on the northPrn and more solid portion ,of the bed than elsewhere. The bottom is hard, of shells, with a light covering of mud. On the Wt>Rtern portionthe substratum was of mud, but elsewhere it was gennall~- hard, probab1,,- of sarnl. To the north ward of the bed the bottom was of sand, soft ou top aud hard undemeath; to the south and west soft mud was found. The oysters were single, of medium size, and goorl quality. No sponge or grass was found, but mans old and broken shells. In the vicinity of t.lie rnucl!ly bottoms the shells were blnck and uo yoimg were discovered, but on the central Ilart of the main hell, where the shells were of ordinary color and moderately clean, large nnmber8 of _young were found. It was noticed that man~· of the young had been destroyed by the drills, afl(l especially about the solid portion of the bed, whne as many as 152 out of 156 on one shell had suffered. A8 the channel was approached the drills (a.~tyris) di<l not appear to be as uumerou:o; nor to have done as much damage, ouly about one-fourth of the young having been de;,troye<l. The number of oysters to the square yard, the mean of four observatfons on different parts of the bc,l, was 0.36. Hern Itdftnd Berl.-Originall_y this bed was sonth of the channel into Guilford Creek, but by the action of natural causes and by dredging it has been extended across that chanuel and conneded with the Hird BP11. It lies due south of that hetl and extends in an east and west direction one mile, a111l has a width of ahout one-half mile. Its area is 2,09:!,000 square yards, and it is next in size to the Birtl Bed. Tile depth of wat.er is from 14 to 22 feet, the shoal water l,ying a little to the westward of the central portion of the bed, and the deep water being found in the Guilford Channel. The be1l is hroke11 about the edges, especially the northwestern one, ancl where it borders on the Guilford Ulmnnel, but elsewhere and in the center it is comparati\'ely solid. A few mnd or soft sand spaces were found in the east:ern part. The oyster8 are distrilmted very eYcnly o\·cr the entire area. The bottom generally is hard, of shells aud sand, though oul.r a small amollnt of the latter was found. In the Guilfor<l Channel awiits vicinity the bottom is softer aud the 8nbstratum of mud. To the southward of the bed hard sand is found, and in the channel to the westwanl the usual soft mud. The oysters were single, small, and principally of a young growth. Those adnlt oysters taken by us were of fair quality. Many old broken shells were brought up by the dredge but no Rponge or grass. M.any young were discovered and a large number, ow~r 2;) per cent., had been destroyed by drills. J,arge numbers of asty1·is were present with the .Yoirng. 'rhe number of o_ysters to the square yard, the mean of six observations, was 0.29. Bed.~ f!( the (foiljorrl C/umne/.-Sonth of the Guilforil Flats, on each Aide of the channel into Guilford Creek, are two 11arrow ledges of o_ysters, extending east and west. and following the trend of the channel. The northern bed is 1 mile in length, aurl.has its greatest width, of one-third of a mile, at itR eastern extremity, and its least, of one-tenth of a mile, at its western. Its area is 585,000 square J·anls. The southern bed is 1~ miles long, one·quarter of a mile broad at its western a.ml one-tenth of a mile at its eastern extremity. Its area is 630,000 square yards. The northern hed ha~ a.n a.verage depth of water over it of 11 feet. The southern bas from~ to 21 feet, the deeper water heiug on the extreme western part of the becl. Both beds, though narrow, are solid, being but little broken lWen about tile edges. They are old and not freqt1ently worked. The bottom is of mud and Rhells for several feet. and underneath that a hard, stratum. The oysters were scarce, and no youug were found. Beach I.~land Bed.-This is a small Bed, lying about 1 mile NNE. of Beach Island, and south of the narrow channel into Deep Creek. It is irr1 gular in shape and com9rises an area of 225,000 square yal'<ls. The depth of water over it is from 12 to 17 feet. 'Ibe bottom is of mud and shells,

Parker's Bed.-This is a small bed l~·jng east of \VattR' Island, aud on tlw \WS!ern sitlP of tltt· channel int.o Pocomoke Sonud. It is long :u1<l uano\\-, extends north and Routh fin'-eighths of a mile, aml ha" a11 lfferng-e width of oue·fiftu of a mile. The uepth of wakr is frnrn l:? to :!-l foet, the shoal water being· found abont the middle of tl1e hed aml the tlePpest water on the 1'011tilea11tern portion. 'rite bed is nuhroken except about. the edg·e", a111l the oysters are spread n11iformJ~· cffer the area, which comprises 4!35,000 sqnare yards. The bottom is hard aud co1111ists of a stratum, ;; feet thick, of shells ltn<l mud, O\'er a stratum of har<l sand or cla;r. Tlw contigwms bottoms are of soft sand or mml, \Yith a hard substratum. The oysters were ;;ingle~ of mo1lernte size, and similar in qualitr to those 011 the other beds of thP Sound. They were not nm11erous, the nnmber to the square yard beiug 0.57, jmt. that nnmher is larger thau on ai.1~· of the otller hedli in Poco· moke. Some of the red sponge wa11 found, but nothing ehw. Large numhers of young- aud drills (astyris) were discornretl, but for some reason the drills appeared to Irnn· been less destructive than elsewhere. Those oysters found nea,r the bed werp larger than those on it, but had 110 young attached to them. The Brirt Bcd.-This bed lies to the northward a]J(l westward and oft' th mouth of Chescouuessex Creek. It is small, nearl,Y onil iu sl1ape, and comprises an area of ."Jl i ,ooo square yards. Hs extent east alJ(l WN\t is ffre-eighths of a mile and its greatest width, north alJ(l south, iR threetentbs of a mile. The cfopth of watt>r is from 19 feet ou the ea:;tern edg!' to 48 feet on the western. The btod is unbroken, except about the edges, \d1ere tile oysters are sornewlrnt scattPrl'd; on tlrn 80lid portions they are not very e\·enly di:strilmte<l, being more numerous ahont tlw center of the bed than elsewhert~. The bottom is hard, autl probahl,Y of sand and :sliPlls, but, owiHg to the depth of water, it was impossible to use the probe sueeessfnllr; tile contiguous bottoms are, howen:\r, of the character deseribetl, awl it is probable that there is uo difference on tht> lwd. The o.ysters were large and single aud of suvl'rior quality to auy ou the other beds. ,\.. mu1lerate number of young and a few drills were found, bnt no sponge or grass, thoui.:-11 some of tlie latter was discov. ered among the scattered oy:1ters. The number to the square yard was 0.2i.
DENSITIES.

The density of the water on the different beds was obtained in thP samt· manner as iu Tang·ier Sound. The least density founti, that of 1.0113, wa8 across the mouth of tl1e Pocomoke Uiver at low water of the spring tide. The water of the greatest density, that of 1.0174, was taken from abont the middle of the Sound, over the Bird, Bnoy Spit, l\lndd~· Ma1·sh, and Hem fa.land Rocks. The density over the beds, therefore, would be withiu ,those limits, the variatiou amounting to O.OOtil, The effect of the tide does not appear to bt\ i11v111fable, as tbe greater densities were found as frequently on the ebb tide as on the tlootl. The 1le1lth of water and the pre,·ailiug winds ha,'e probably a greater effect than anything else, as the density increases with the depth, and the prevalence of easterly or southeasterly winds, hacking the waters of the bay up into tlJe ~ound, would have a like effect. As the variation noticeable during the space of ele'ie11 days, under various conditions of weather, was so small, it can hardly be much gl·eater at any ti11w, and unless much greater than shown by the records, aucl if representing the change iu salinity, it can ha,·p but very little, if any, efft>ct upon the o;vsters on the beds. By the following tables of comparison it will be seen that the fluctuation of density is, as in Tangier Souud, greittest at the head of the Soun<l and least at its eutrance, with au iucreased fluctuation where the intlueuc(· of the Mesongo and Guilford Creeks is folt. On the beds above the Bird Rock the ditlerence of density noticed was O.OH61. On tl1e remainder of the beds the difference was 0.0015, showing that there is a much smaller change in te density over the southern beds than over the northern.

CURRENTS.

Over the Pocomoke beds tltl:' general Ret of the ebb current is westerly until it reaches the sl1oal between and south of Broad and Ape's Hole Creeks, where it turns to the southward into the main cha1111el. The majority of the ohservations of the ebtl current were made during moderate 11ortheast.erl.r breezes, but the direction seems to have been but little influenced by them, though the strength probahly was; as at high and low water lly the tide tables, when there should have been no perceptible current, oue was observed of from 0.1 to 0.2 of a mile an hour. The maximum strength observed was 0.5 of a mile per hour. The flood current sets northeast over the beds, and has a maximum strength of 0.5 of a mile per hour, and is but very slightly influenced in direction by the wind. Tn the main channel of the Sound, below the Shell Rocks and over the Muddy Marsh Rocks the flood current sets to the northward, following the general direction of the channel. The maximum strengtll of this current, when uninfluenced by the wind, was 0.45 of a mile per hour. No observations of the strength of the ebb current were made in the main channel; but it is probably equal, or of slightly greater strength, than the flood, and sets to the southward. Over the Bird and Hern Island Rucks the flood current sets to ti.le northward aud eastward into Mesongo and Guilfonl Creeks, with a maximum velocity, when uninOuenced IJy the wind, of 0.24 of a mile per hour. The ebb sets to the southward and westward, curving to the southward as it becomes influenced by the main current, with a maximum velocity of 0.4 of a mile per hour. Xorth of tl1e Guilford !<'lats the flood sets northeasterly toward Muddy Creek. The maximum velocity obserrnd during light northerly breezes was 0.3 of a mile per hour. South of the Gmlford Fla.ts the current follows the general direction of the channel, the flood having a tendency towards Hunting Creek, where the channel int.o Guilford Creek joins the latter. The maximum velocity obserYed during light northerly breezes was 0.5 of a mile per hour. The ebb out of .Mesongo and Guilford Creeks setl! t-0 the southward and westward, following the channel until it reaches the Bini and Hern Island Beds, where it curves to the southward. Its maximum rnlocity was 0.4 of a mile per hour. The current over the Brig and Parker's Beds sets to the northward a11dto the 80uthward; the maximum strength of the tlood, when unintluencecl by the wiud, was 0.24 of a mile per hour, but a· moderate breeze appears to be sufficient to cause a marked increase of strength and change of direction. Off the mouth of the Chesoonessex, where the wind, though light, hall the width of Chesapeake Bay and both Tangier and Pocomoke Sounds to sweep over, the Hood tide on the third quarter had a set to the northward and eastward of U.4,

UNITED STATES OOAST AND GEODETIC 8URVEY.

of a mile per hour. North of Parker's Bed the flood, on the first quarter, during a moderate southwesterly breeze, was founu to set to the uort!Jeast at a rate of 0.6 of a mile per hour. T!Je oystermeu greatly overrate t!Je strength of the currents ill the Sonll<1:-;, putting the maximum velocity at about four knots on the ebb anti somew!Jat less on the flood; but I could find no reason that would explain so great an increase over the velocities as establii:;hed by oursdnls, and consequently doubt the value of' the estimate.
DEPOSITS.

The fact that on nearly all the beds, and especially those in the vidnity of the creeks and rivers and iu the upper part of the Sound, there is a Jig·ht coYeriug ol' mud, more or le~8 thick, over the oysters, would lead to an inference that there must he a deposit of that l:haracter going on. Ou most of the beds the st1bstratum of the bottom was lrnnl aud tlw tltickue::;,; of th(· surface-(:o,-ering gradually decreased as the entrance to the Soml(l was approaclied. In the np1wr part of the Sound shells were found with the mud for seYcral feet, and of such a number aml character, being old and discolored, as to forbid the Rnpposition that they had recently sunk iu tlw mud or been covered by it. The Pocomoke River, draining au extensiYe tract of the Penin:-;nla, would bri11g· down a large amount of sediment, which the strong ebb current would (·an~- directly oyet' tlw lwds in tlw upper part of the Sound. The set of the ebb is eaRt, and, as will be 1'een hy the chart, the dee1wr water lies neMest the southern shore of the upper Sound, aud those beds lying to fop sonthwar<l of the channel are the hardest and least broken. Tlle sllorns are low and marsh~-, and probably add somewhat, to any sediment held by the main <·-nrre11t lwfore it t>nh'r8 the Sournl. I infer that there is a deposit goiug ou of maximum amount oyer tl1e Old Hock,,: and those to the northward of the channel, and decreasing as the entra,uee. to the Sound is npproaclted. The amount in any given period of time would be difficult to ascertain, but the character will he shown to some extent by au examination of the specimens of bottom. \Yhetl1er tlw nmonut of matter deposited is sufficient in quantity to seriotli'lly affect the beds is a matter of r'.011jeeture; I sllould judge that it was not, and my opinion coincides with that of all the oysteruwn I was allle to interrogate. That it must ha,·e 8ome effect cannot be doullted, and the m·ident deterioration of tlle beds in Pocomoke Sound may be accounted for, to some extent, by the supposition that the effect is injurious; but so many other ancl more dhect can11es exi11t for tlrn deterioration that it is difficult to diminatl\ their influence. The fact that the hells ha\'e existed aud han· lwen \rnrked since the first, setth>n1ent of the country would lead to au inference that the effect, if prejt1dicial, was very slightly so. Tlle scattered oysters lying on the sand.s and those beds in the vicinity of sand-shoals and iu shallow water, the Muddy Marsh aucl Beach Island Rocks particularly, are exposed to damage by "sanding" in a manner similar to certain beds in Tangier Sound, a1Hl whit-11 has already lwen tlescribed. The large amount of grass, sponge, and sea-weed growing on the saud shoals, especial!,:. the one to the east of Hern Island and south of the Ouilford Channel, is frpque11tly torn up by the heavy gales and deposited on the beds with the same iujurious effect that it hatl in Tan~ier Sound. Ht>avy southerly gales will sometimes cover the beds above the Buoy Spit and Shell Beds with mud for a short time, !:mt not sufficiently long, it is said, to affect tlle oysters seriou11ly.
EF.FEC'l' OF ICE AND GALES.

Tlle heavy gales that occ.ur in winter and summer, though principally durinp; the former season, increase or diminish the depth of water on the beds 11ometimes as much as three feet. Strong northerly and northwesterly gales have the effect of diminishing the depth of water, piling up any floating ice upon the leeward sllores, and cutting away parts of those shores. Hea...-y south easterly and southerly gales will increase the depth of water on the beds, stir up the soft mmldy bottom of the channels and beds above Shell Rock; and, during the winter, iu addition to piling the ice on the leeward shores and planted beds near Ape's Hole Creek~ will pile it up on the Old Rocks, Buoy Rock, and Shell Rocks. Generally speaking, tbe beds in this, as in Tangier Sound, are in too much water to permit their being uncovered by even the heaviest, gales, or to allow the

S. Ex. 49-39

306

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

ice to ground upon them at any time; but those beds in shoal water (of about one fathom), and the planted beds, which are generally in 1esR, are subjected to both evils. The effect of gales and ice in Pocomoke Sound seems to be less than that in Tangier Sound, in consequence of its less extent and smaller area.
GENERAL INFORMA'l'ION GIVEN lff OYS'l'ERMEN.

The following information is that derived from the answers to tbe questions propounded to the fishermen and others. All the oystermen and dealers that were encountered during the Reason, so tar as was possible, were interrogated. That which wa8 not pertinent to the sul~ject, or cvident,Jy influenced by selfinterest or other considerations, has been excluded. There haR been no material change of the channel within the men10Q· of the oldest fish~rmen, nor have they eYer found oysters in the deep water of the maiu channels of either Sound. With regard to the improvement or <leteriorntion of the beds, it was the general opinion that the beds had been much extended in size, that the qualit~· of the oysters had improved, both as to size and flavor, but that the uumber ou the beds had been very materially diminislied, so much so, that it was hardly profitable to work on some of the beds. About thirty years back, the large beds in the Sound were not known to the fislwrmcn and when first discovered and worked, the oysters were in clusters, long and tl1in valved and of poor quality, thougli ver~· numerous and easily taken. Sim~e their discover;)', and especiallJ during the last ten years, tlie heds haye been greatly overworked and the number of oysters mncl1 lessened. Former]~', t,Jie hest op;tprs were found on the 'I't>rrapiu Ha11dl'>, all(l tl1e1·e wt'r<' nmw on the sarnls i11sl10re of tlie beds; uow tl1e finest o~·sters i11 tl1t~ ::iournls arc found on the sands bordcriug on the bedr; and are considered better than any ill the g·e11eml market. All the beds have been much extended b~- dredging, especiallj- the Bird Hock in 1>ocornok!~ Sound and the Great Rock in Tangie1· Sound, the former being two-thirds larger thau when first discovered, and the three rocks, of which Great Rock was originally composed, having been dragged iuto one continuous bed. Though thus extended, it was the opinion that there were not as many oysters on the beds at present as were found on the smaller areas. Jn Fishing Bay, at the northern extreme of Tangier Sound, though the beds as a whole had deteriorated, during the last four years there had been some improvement on account of a more rigid observance of "dose time." The ca11se assigned for the deterion.1tiu1J, and P\'Cll the admittance of the fact, depended very much upon the occupation of the iuformant. The tongers, or those who pursued the fishery with tm1gs alone,, were unanimous in laying the deterioration to excessiYe (lredging, while the dredgers, or those owning pungies or other vessels employed exclusively with the dredge, while they admitted the decrease in the number of oysters, laid such decrease to the action of natural and unex. plained causes, arguing that the evident extension of the beds and improvement of the oysters, due to dredging, was sufficient to prove its good rather than ill effects. 'Vith regard to the effect of ice i11 cold weather, every one coincided in the opinion that the oysters in deep water were most affected and those i11 sl1oal or brackish water were least so. In the same depths an<l character of water, those oysters.about ti.le e1lges of "muddy rocks" and close to muddy channels or sloughs were most attected IJy the cold or a severe freeze. After the latter event the packers distiuguish the deep- water oyster b;y its dark, slimy appearance, aud decline it, though at the same time shoal-water oysters are in good order aud arc accepted. With regard t,o the quality of the auim<tls, those in the Souuds were considered finer than those in the creeks and ri>ers, and of the different beds those lrom the Shark's Fin, Terrapin Sands, and Bird Beds were considered superior. Regarcling flavor alone, those from the salt water were the best, and generally the salter the water the better the flavor. ·with regard to an increased freshness of water, due t<l freshets and heavy rains, it was the general opinion that during the winter season it was not of much consequence, but that in spring or summer heavy rains or freshets were ver~' beneficial, especially in the spawning season, hastening its advent and shortening its duration. An increased freshness of water always fattened the oysters. 0,vsters in salt water were always poor, and oyst.ers were generally })OOrer after a dry

season. Planted oysters above Pig Point aud the Old Rocks, iu Pocomoke Sound, have been known to die from absorbing too much fresh water, and those on the Old Rocks have sometimes suffered from the same cause; but this only occurs during heavy freshets. With regard to the depth of water aud character of bottom, shallow water was preferred, and sticky mud or mud and sand, about six inches in thickness over a. hard substratum, was considered the best, though a larger a.mount of mud did not matter, provided it was not so soft as to allow the oysters to sink in it and bad a strong current over it. The oysters were said to feed on the flood tide, having their bills open then and at no other time. No one bad noticed any enemies or animals that pre.ved upon the oysters, and all seemed to be ignorant of the drills and their destructive effects. The oysters are "culled," that is, they are separated from the old shells and other debris, while . the boat or vessel iR on or near the bed. Everything except the oysters is thrown back, sometimes striking the bed and as often the mud. The young oyster" under a year and a half in growth aml less than two inches long are also thrown back. All persons interrogated were of the opinion that at least 713 per cent. of the o;rsters on a bed are taken off each year, and that no more than 50 per cent. should be removed. Off the beds near Raine's Point, at least 100,000 bushels, or about !!0,000,000 oysters, were taken in the season of 1878. Off the Great Roek, about 1001000 bushels, were taken by one hundred boats in October and November of 1877. The oysters on the rock at the end of November were so scarce that but a very small number of boats eould find profitable work on the bed. In the spring about 75,000 bushelt> more were taken up anrl sent north, and aR the oyRters were small, they amounted to probably 15,000,000 at least. Exclusive, then, of the fishiug done <luring the winter months, in one season it is estimated that 30,000,000 of oysters were removed from one bed alone. Nearly all the oystermen advocated a "close time," either from April 1 or May 1 to October 1; many considered a p1·olongatiou until November 1, ancl an entire rest every other year, would be beneficial. With regard to transplanting the oyster and its transportation, all experienced persons were of the opinion that delicacy of handling, and freedom from jars, concussions, and shocks of any kind were desirable. Oysters when under hatches have very frequently been killed by heavy thunder storms and firing of gtms. Any concussion or sudden shock will prove llestrnctivt~ if the animals are in a confined space. O,rnters taken up during the summer are much more susceptible to injury from this cause tha.n those obtained during the winter. Oysters are transplanted at any and all seasons, but generally in the spring and autumn. Oysters obtained by the use of the "tongs" are preferred to those dredged, and generally those taken either before or after the spawning season are most desirable. The dredged oysters are apt to be broken about the bills and will <lie on the planting grounds sooner and iu larger numbers than the "t-0nged" ones. Those oysters planted about the Sounds are generally obtained from ''tongers," but those sent to the north, being in such large numbers, are usually dredged. The size and age of the oysters to be transplanted depend on whether they are for em-ly consumption or not. If the former, the larger and older the better, but in the latter case ~·oung oysters, from one to two years old, are preferred. Generally any and all oysters are taken, without regard to age or size. The oysters for the northern planting grounds are usually taken up as soon as ice clears away and are used during the spring. Those transplanted in the Sound are taken up later in the spring, or during the early summer or autumn months, and used during the following winter. Blunt-nosed oysters, with thick shells; do not thrive on the planting grounds. A change of bottom in transplanting oysters is not considered of so mucl1 importance as a chang·e of water. The planted beds should be laid at the mouths of creeks and rivers having a rapid current. 'fhe bottom best for natural beds was considered best for planted ones. The spawning season was said to he from May until August, inclusive, though most of the spawning was done in June and July. All opinions coincided that the oyster in shoal water spawned first, but differed as to whether, the depth being the same, all oysters on the sa111e bed spawned at or about the same time, as many being for as against the theory. Currents were said to have no effect upon the spawning. Oysters of one year's growth, three· fourths of an inch long, have been seen with the spawn in them, and oysters on natural beds were thought by the majority

to spawn sooner than the planted ones, though there was not much difl:erence. Oysters transplanted with the spawn in them, however, will cease spawning. A wet or warm spring would hasten the time of spawning, but would not shorteu its duration. Heavy freshets were very destrnctfre to the ''spat" in Pocomoke Sound, driving it out into the bay, and large schools of fish, especially trout and tailori-;, clevoured a gooll many every spring and summer. The young were suppm;ed to "strike" m·ery three years, though there was but little regularity about it, a bed sometimes running for ten years with a young growth on it every year and then failing to produce anything for two or three years. Sometimes one part of the bed will be co,·ered by young, and another part totally bal'I'e11. No s~stematic attempt had ever been made to increase the amount of" cultch" in the Sounds, though a few pur1'ons had placed old shells, ballast, boards, and boughs about their planting ground and f\ncceede1l i11 making a good catch. It was the general opinion that the oyster increased in size from oue to two inches in the first year of growth and a little more than that during the f\ecoud; afterwards the increase was much less. Oysters from two to four years old were com;idered as bef\t for the market, and are then from 3 to 4 inches long. Ten buslu'l;; of oyRters were consillered a profitable day's work for a tonger. For a dredger the nnrn ber of bushels varied on account of their diftereut sizes. About 60 bushels were considered a profitable day's work for the larger vessels and from 20 to 30 for smaller craft. The dredging vessels employ from four tu nine men, and the ''tonging" canoes one man and a boy. Tonging could not be carried on profitably in depth1' greater than 4 fathoms in the Sound, and dredging in not more than (i. The dredge,, var,r in si%e, from 2 to 4 feet across the mouth, with from eight to sixteen teeth. Ceuernll,v the,v ar·i· made about 3 feet \ride, with tweh·e or fot1rteen teeth, but Yary a good deal in weight. ::\Iy informant fo1rnd that, generally speaking, it was more profitable to :fish with the tongs exelusinlly, for tlw large oysters used for barreling hy the dealers, an(l to dredge for packing and canning establishments. The tongs are worked at srna1l expense and the "barrel" oysters bring a mudt larger price, though tliey are necessarily selected oysters and more difficult to obtain. 'fhe prices paid during the season of 1877-'78 were about $1 per barrel for "barrel" oysters and from J to 40 cents for the ordinary oysters from the beds; the "snaps," or most inferior quality, liringing tlie lowe1't price, and 40 cents being paid only for "extra culled" oysters. About 20 centH per bushel wouhl allow a small profit. The flavor is not generally take11 into account, aml the <leg-ree of l'atnesR a111l the size settle the price. Salt-water oysters sometimes commaud lwttrr prices whrn intended for a special market or to supply some unusual demand. "Tith the irnproYed appfou1ces in use, as at present, the general opinion wa1:1 that about twenty or tm'nt.1-five years ago 011c-tl1ird more oyster;; could have been taken in the northern part of Tangier Sound thau at present, from t"o to five times as many about Crisfield, and in Pocomoke Sound neai:ly seven times as many aiS at the present day; that without any of the modern contrivances it was possi.hle then for either tongers or dredgers to take many more in a day than at present. The general opinion of all persons in and about the Sounds, with a very few exceptions, was that the beds were being wm;ked much beyond their capacity, and the majority were in favor of extending the "close tin:e" as a remedy for the deterioration. Many thought that a resting time of a year or more would be beneficial. All were in favor of enforcing the law prohibiting the dredging and working of the beds during the "close time," and all testified that there was no attempt toward tlte enforcement of the law at present, either by the oyster police or any one else.
CONCLUSIONS.

The foregoing llages, with the record and charts, contain all the data collected during the season for the study of the bedis and the conditions affecting the animals upon them. Not regarding it as within my province and not possessing sufficient knowledge of the subject, I have not attempted any study of the biology of the oyster, but have confined my report to as concise a description as pos1:1ihle of the beils and conditions surrounding the various forms of life upon them. The foIJowing remarks are sim}ll,\· the conclusions drawn from certain peculiar features and facts established by the im·estigation and testimony and an att~mpt to account for them. In reviewing the remarks upon the different beds, it will be seen that there is a marked absence of oysters classed as "young," or those supposed to be of the last brood, on all beds above Kedge's

Strait in Tangier Sound, and above the Bird Rock in Pocomoke Sound. In Tangier, the young first appeared in considerable quantities on the middle of Muscle Hole Bed and Piney Island Bar. There were none in either the Manokin or Big AnnemesRex Rivers or on the northern part of Harris' Rock, though large numbers were found on the central and southern portions of the latt~r. The southern beds of both Sounds were plentifully supplied. Again, on the southern beds there was an absence of the class termed by us "young growth," or oysters a1Jparently spawned during the previous season, while 011 the northern beds of both Sounds the proportion of this class was very large. Over these different beds the change of density is too slight to enter into the question and the currents too nearly similar, both in direction and strength, to have influenced the difference in production. On nearly all of the northern beds in both Sounds the bottom ii;; muddy or the beds in close proximity to muddy bottoms. 'l'o the southward, however, the bottom is hard arnl the beds surrounded by sand or gravel, except on tlie edges nearest the channels. Again~ all the northern beds in both Sounds are in comparatively shoal water and those in the southern parts in deep water. There are, then, two similar facts noticed in both Sounds with regard to the presence and absence of the young and "young growth"; the former have been found in deep water and on hard bottoms, the latter in shoal water, on or near soft bottoms. 1'he character of the bottom can hardly be of much importance in this case, for though a hard, clean bottom is necessary for a successful attachment of the "spat," yet the bottoms on the northern part of the Sounds must be suf. ficiently so to obtain a large quantit,v, as is shown by the large number of ,young growth on those beds; and that the absence of the young is not due entirely to that cause i;; ;;hown b,v thefr scarcity on the Ubain Shoal and Drummiug Shoal ne<ls in Tm1gier, and Shell and ~Inddy l\farish Beds in Pocomoke Soun<l, where the bottom is bard and moderately clean. Remaining, then, as the only probable cause known to us, is the difference of depth of water. It will be found upon re\Tiewing the remarks and record that almost invariabl.r the young are found in deep water and the young growth in shoal. It was the opinion of the oystermen that the oysters in the Sounds increased from one to three inches in length in the first j'ear of their existence. The class termed "young growth" by us were from three-fourths of an inch to one and .a half inches long; and supposing the o;vstcrmen to be correct in their estimation of increase in size, the class termed "young growth" wonl<l then be of the same season's brood, spawned much earlier than those termed youug. The iuvestigatiou of the beds was carried 011 iu September, and iu Tangier Sound the principal amount of information was collected during the latter part of that month and the first part of October. If, then, the oysters on the shoal-water beds ha<l spawned in the early part of June, they would have had about four months growth when our observations were made. In searching for spawn in the oysters during the latter part of August and first part of September, Mr. Rice was unable to discover any except in those from deep water, an<l that fact, together with the inference drawn from the preceding paragraphs, leads me to belie,·e the oystermen correct in stating that there is a difference in the time of spawning of the shoal and deep water oysters. There is but one other .way of accounting for the absence of young on the northern beds, and that is by accepting the supposition that the "spatting" not only does uot occur every year, but that it occurs only on parts of the Sounds during each, season. Such is the opinion of many people of experience, but I am inclined, from the results already given, to prefer the other solution of the problem, not having found any reason that would support, the opposite theory or lead to its entertainment.· The difference in time of spawning in shoal and deep water ii:; probably due to difference in temperature, the deeper water naturally being of the lowest. The establishment or the refutation of this supposition, as also of that of the difference of the_times of spawning, is very necessary, especially of the latter, as it would afford a sure hasis for such legislation for the protection of the beds as will soon be necessary. Aside from the general absence or presence of young on particular beds, it was noticed that a. much smaller number were found on or adjacent to the muddy bottoms, or on the sands where there was much grass or sponge. On the beds a large number of young were sel<lom found where there was much of the red sponge, though. there was not always a. diminution of the former when the latter was present. The absence of the young may be very readily accounted for if the sponge

had formed previom; to the "spatting," as it would prevent the exposure of the "cultch." The sponge is of very rapid growth, and I was informed that on an unworked bed it had been known to become three or four feet thick in a few months. If, then, it had formed and commenced growing after the "spatting" season, the young would not he as much disturbed b,v it as they woul<l if the growth had been pre\·ious to their adYent. This is another reason in fa·or of the theory that the depth of the water influences the time of spawning, as the effect of the sponge on the numbers of ~·mmg was greater in deep than in shallow water. The number of drills (astyris) was, generally speaking, in direct proportion to the munher of young, and the Pocomoke beds, especially the Bird and Hern Island Beds, appeared to have suffered most from their ravages. A description and sketch of thi:s animal, taken from :specimeus preserved by me, has been made hy ::\:fr. W. H. Dall, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, who has kind]~- furnished me with copies. Very few 8tar fish and welks and no other enemies were discovered in the Sound8, and the drills iire probabl~- the only ones that do any considerable damage. With regard to the beneficial effect, or the reYerse, of fresh water, there can be no doubt that the oysters at least appear fatter and are superior after absorbing it, though they become poorer in flavor. In order to test the e1foct of fresh water upon them and to detsrmine if the low spring tides had any share in causing the decrease in the number:-; on the beds, a dozen oysters were selected from the same bed and haul of tbe dredge. Six of them were opened immediate!~- and inspected and found to be rather poor, of small size and dark color, but of the ordinary flavor. The remaining six OJ:ster:s were placed in perfectls fresh water for twenty-four hours, the water being changed several tinws (lurillg that interYal. Thes· were then opened and inspected. The.) were alive and iu gootl order, ,-er.)· fat, or apparentl~- so, and of a creamy white color and much swollen, but of very insipid taste. As the oysters were alive at the end of a day's immersion in fresh water, they cannot well be destroyed by the brackish water of low spring ehh1', to wl1ich they would not be exposed for more than six hour.s, though a continuance of heavy freshets might very seriously affect them. As there is but one river in both Sounds (the Pocomoke) likely to subject the oysters to this eYil. for the nrnin lwrli;; thne iR nothing to fear. 'l'he evil eflects of sudden jars and concussions are probably due to the breakage of the delicate pedal muscle, which affor the spawning season, in common with all other parts of the animal, is in a more or less weakened condition. I u explaining tlte fact, that the oysters in deep wakr arc Ill ore attectml bJ cold water and ice than those on the shoals, it is nece:ssars to remember that the lower the temperature of sea water the greater its density, and tlrnK as the surface water becomes cooler it would sink. The freezing point of salt water is below that of fre8h. Therefore the oysters in the deep water, or, generally speaking, thoRe remote from the mouths of the streams, may hrwe surrounding them water of a slightly lower temperature, depending upon tlie amount of salinity, than those o;ysters near the creeks and rivers that are surrounded by ice. Again, the deep water would be much slower to lose or acquire heat thau that on the ;;nrface or in Jes;; depth>;, which would necessarily he affected quickly by all changes of weather. The statement tl1at thi~ oysters recover and reappear after the "sanding'' process, must be received with great caution, opposed as it is to most experience. That some few may survive is 11ossibly the case, hut that the majority recm'er after being cow!'l'd with sand for any length of time is very doubtful. The testimony of all penmns in the neighborhood of the Sounds was tM the effect that the beds were deteriorating. In the absence of any reliable observations, extending over any length of time, their opiuious mnst be taken as correct, at least as t-0 the fact, although perhaps only approximately iso as to the degree. Accepting, theu, the statement, it is necessary to account for the deterioration if possible. After the original formatiou and growth of the he.ds they would at some time, the same con· ditions continuing, cease their development, neither increasing in size, or in number of oysters, there being a natural liruit to expansion in either direction. Supposing, then, a bed to have extended itself as far as the conditions of bottom and water or other natural limit would allow, a.ll future expansion could be only in the number of oysters on the bed; this is limited principally by the amount of food and tlie room for development (t,be question of enemies not being considered,

as, there beiug uo increase., if they were not in sufficient uumbers to preveut the growth of tlie bed and number of oysters, the;y would not br sufficient to cause its destruction or deterioration). The numher ot oysters would then, Oil a limited bed, steadily increase as loug as. there was sufficient room and fo()(l supplied them until they had reached their limit, a rather indefinable one, in that direction, the quality of the oysters not being taken into cousideration. Having reached that point, the number of oysters to all intents remain the same as lung as the conditions under which they had previously lived were not changed. 'fo cause, then, either an increasP or diminution of tlie uumber of oysters or size of the ht:>d, a new factor must he brought in, when, aill conditionH beiug· changed, tbt:> life of the animali'i begins anew and prog-resses differentl,v. As there can be 110 doubt that both the beds arnl o,vsten; of Tangier and I)ocomokc Sound;,; have changed greatl,r in cliaracter since their first dist~(ffery, i11 accounting for that chaug·e it is ue<·essary to discoYer the uew factor or factors that han' been i11trod1wetl and that luwe been instrumental in effecting it. Brietly, the change in the be<li-; hai-; bee11 a material expansion of their limits and a material diminution of the numlier of oystt,rs uvon them, and therefore tht· cam1es for sucl1 changes mu~t be sought amoug such as it is known would produce like effect:s. Disregarding for the present the age1w~· of man rn the matter, the qnei'ition is, What natural cause or cam;es would both expand the he<ls aml diminish the number of oysters! A bed is extended rn1turally by the drifting spat or" youug brood·~ attaching the1111selves to auy clean, hard, and moderate!~· rough substance coutig·uous to tl1t' bed. The locomotive powers of the ''spat" exist for but a short time, aud, except when assisted by the current, they can only moYe a short distance, and unless ,;ome suitable object soou prt>seuts itself for their attachment they will sink into the soft bottoms and die. The principal PXJ1<rnsio11 of the lH·<li-i 80 far as <·oulil l1P dl:i·ct<~d hy 11aturP 11111...;t, lw\H'\'er, haYP been accomplished long ago, the beds being .<;urrouuded originally, aml indeed at present, by iioft bottoms of a character which would be most <1estructive to the "brood" unless some Ruhst.ance was interposeLl between it and them for their reception. Natural expansion can only be achieYed to aiiy extent in the manner described, and though probably there is and has been a slow extension of the beds due to na.tural unassisted causes, their great increase in area duriug the last thirty years must be assigned to other agents. · The diminution of the number of oysters may be etlected by several natural causes. An increased deposit. of earthy or yegetable matter upon the beds would, if in sufficient quantities to bur,\- the oyster, pffect tl1e llt>stmctiou of hoth 01'1 aud youug; but uo sueh depo:;it ltas h~wu noticed, 11or could it well occur withont 8howing its pre,;euce iu otht~r ways, principally by ebangiug the channels and causing shoals, aml Ho such changes have occurred, 111~· inve-sti~ation showing but slight deviations in either channels, shoals, or character of the bott-01n from that established b,y the first h,vdrograpllic snrn'y of the loca1it.,v. A change iu the character of the water and bottom which would probably follow a change of cha1111el, a11tl might occur without ~uch chauge, might, hy depriving tlrn animalR of their proper food, cause their dPterioration and destruction: but such a. change, though it would certainly diminish tlie number on the beds, would do :-;o suddenly all(l the evil ettects would be noticed in the uysters remitiniug, their qnalitJ' aml flavor, indt,>ed their vitality, being very much impaired. No such impairment has been obsene<l, however, the oysters being larger and finer tlian when the beds were firilt tliscovere<l. 'l'hat fact alone will elimiuat,e mauy quantities from the equatiou, for any natuml cause injurious to all the oysters on the beds would be evident at once by an examination of those found at present. If', however, the destruction or non-production of the necessary number of young is accomplished by means that are uot harmful to the mature o~'ster, a canst> is tliscoyered for the diminution of all, in harmony with the existing facts. Considering first the destruction ofyonug; large numbers, immense when compared with the production of other animals, are without doubt naturally destroyed by the falling of the "spat" upon unfavorable grounds, the prevalence of heavy freshets which would drive the "brood" into the bay and probably cause its loss, antl the ravages of various enemies. But all these causes l1ave been in operation continually since th@ first formation of the beds, and the animals han· survived and increased while contending with them. Therefore an increase of power for injury roust be assigned to one or all of these to account for the diminished number of oysters. Probabl~· the "spat" falls on more favorable ground since the beds were discovered than was formerly the

312

case, owing to the increased amount of '' cultch" due to the fishing of the beds, and aside frolll that the conditions surrounding and operating upon the heds are so similar to those in the past that the loss of the young could not be much greater from tl1e wa.nt of atJ,acllment. The freshets and other natural causes for uiminh;hed numbers of young have also beeu long in operation and the deterioration cannot be justly assigned to them. Remaining then to be accounted for are the ravages of enemies. 1'hose found by us during the season were aityris in large numbers, a few welks, and a wry few star-fish, hut as the oysterme11 were ignorant of both their presence and destructive effects I am unable to decide whether they have increased or diminished in numbers. There is no douht that ,·ery large uumbers of young are dei;troyed by the drills or welks; fully ilfty per cent. on some beds in Pocomoke Sonnd, aud if these small enemies have only within late years entered the Souuds we have one of the principal causes for the deterioration of the beds. But as there is also a marked detflrioration upon those beds upon which no drills were found, still another cause must be at work aud must be sought in the non-production. of the young. Thiis iis caused b;y the failure of the "brood" oyster8, they having been removed or become extinct, thus causing a failure of impregnation. lf the theory is correct that there is a muttial fecundation, partaken of b;v all o~·sters on the beds, tbe spermatozoa being formed and milted somewhat prior to the formation of ova, then it can easily be underst,ood that if tlie oysters are so much separated that e\·en the tides and curreuts cannot bring the spermatozoa witliin reach of the adjacent animals, there could be no production of young. Taking for instance the most Haggerated case in both Sounds, that of the Muddy Marsh Bed, it will bt> seen that the 8et of the current over it is not geiwrally from any ot,her ·adjacent bed, the uearest. mw being Parker's Rock, which is o\'l'l' ;~ mill's 11istant: the oystns ou the J\Iuddy :'.\farsh B1\d were \'ery fow, aud tlie mas.s of shells immense, affording ample 1:1urface for the attachment of the drifting" spat," should there he any. But supposing the oysters on the beds to have been so much diminished that they were 11ot sufficient for mutual fecundation, the distance and situation of other beds is s1rnb as to prevent the current from bringing the products of generation voided on them to the Muddy Marsh rocks, and there would be, as was not.iced, an almost entire failure of young. In the same, though less degree, would the other beds suffer, the amount of spawn voided depending not only upon the number of mature "brood" oysters, but upon their distance from each other and the spaces separating the beds. This theory is supported b;v tlie inve1>tigations that have been made in England, Frauc1·: and Prns8ia, a11d al moM a 11 opiuio118 coiucille that the 11um ber of young in any spattingseason is dependent UlJOll the number of "brood" o;p;ters upon the beds. Indeed, it seems so self.evident a propol:lition that it is hardly worth while to experimentally establish it. It is necessary, then, having- accepted the theory, to detenniue what prO})Ortion of the oysters should be taken off thf' beds, anrl what proportion is actuall.Y removed. As there is no data to my knowledge derived from obserrntions made in this country to determine the first of these two desired points, it is necessary to turn to the experience of foreign oyster fisheries for guidance, ftnd though the animals and the conditions under which they Jiye are not entirely similar, yet some information ma;v be ohtain1>,d ai1d a line of im"estigation marked out for the future. The following is a synopsis of the deductions of Professor Karl Mobiu.s, professor of zoology in the University of Kiel, whose work, in manuscript, on the oyster was kindlr lent me by Professor Hairrl. The observatio11s were made over the Schleswig-Holstein oyster beds by government officials from 17~l0 to 185:!, and were carried on in, practically, the following manner: Each bell was dredged over in three or six plac~;s, according to its size, and the oysters tuk<'n were divided into three classes an<l carefully counted. The elMses were denominated" market.able,"" medium," and'' young growth." The "marketable" oysters were full grown and mature, from 7 to 9 centimeters in length and breadth, and 18 millimeters thick. The "medium" were half-grown oysters, from 16 tQ 18 millimeters thick and of less than 9 centimeters in breadth. The "young growth" were those one or two years old. From these observations Professor l\IOhius discovers that there was an average of 421 medium ossters to 1,000 full-grown ones. The average of all the observationi:1 dift:'ers very little from the number given by each, and consequently shows that there was but slight fluctuation in the proportion iu one hundred and twenty-two years. The medium oysters are considered by Professor Mobius to be those descendan1:8 of the marketable ones that have survived their most

precarious years of existence and escaped their principal euemimi, and are consequently likel~· to reach their full growtlJ. They thus represent the total number of embr,vos spawned which have survived iu the struggle for existence. From his (Mobius') experiments he decides that an oyster spawns about 1,000,000 embryos iu a season, and that 44 per cent. of the mature oysters give forth "spat." [Otller authorities are of' the opiuion that onl,y abont 10 per cent. spaw11; Professor l\Iobius' data appear hardly 1mfil<'i1mt to justi(y his conclusion.] From the above it h; evident that in an assemblag·e uf a thousand oysters, 440,000,000 embryos will be voided every season, and of them 4:H would sur,·i,·e, or 1,045,000 embr,vos would he destroyed where one was preserved. But the medium sized o,ysters also spawn, though they i'.end forth a much smaller number of embryos. J\lobins estimate,; that the 421 in th!' community would protluce about 60,000,000 of" spat." It would therefr1re require about 500,000,000 embryos to produce 421 medium oyst,ers, or l, 185,000 to produce one. Regarding thes(' results, Professor Mo bins is of the opiuioh that no more than 40 per cent. shonhl be removed each year, but, in my opinion, in order to maintain the oysters at a constant number in the abore case, no more tlrnn 2;; per cent. sl1ould be taken, as the one oyste.r in four would be replaced each year. No compariso11 between the Schleswig Holstein beds and tl10>1e on our coast can well be instituted, but as the beds in Tangier and Pocomoke Sounds are of greater extnt, and as the more exteush'e the bed the greater the hr('C(ling power, I shonld consider that. until the annual number of' mature oysters produced is known, it would he safe to take a!Jout 50 per cent. from the beds, supposing them to be in good condition. That is but an estimate, and ma~· be au erroneous one, but certainly it is not too small. It now remains to be seen what number of o~·sters are actu:illy removed from the beds. I regret that statistics of .the oyster trade in the Sounds are not at haud for reference, aud also that the pressure of other work while I was in that locality prevented me from obtaining them. Such obi:;en·ations as we wern able to make, howeyer, will furnish a basii:; for a somewhat rude estimate of the number of oy11ters and young take11 off the beds during the season. While in Crisfield Harbor, about the 11th October, we counted fifty-seven sail oyster llredgers. The number of bushels carried b~· them was estimated, and the estimat;e subsequently verified by the statements of the masters of the seyeral vessels in each class.

The day had been a bad one tor dredging, aml but a small i111111be1· of dredgers had been at work, and they had come into port much earlier than usual; consequently the average and total number of oysters are below tile usual figures. On the same day, in order to ascertain the nmnber of young attached to the mature oysters that were taken off the beds, I had three samples, of a peck each, selected from different ,·essels entering the harbor and the number of :young on the S.

The total number of bushels brought into Crisfiehl, as seen by Table I, amounted in one day to 2,408, and estimating the number of oysters to a bu<Shel to be between 150 or 200, we ba\'e for tbe results of one day's fishing from 361,200 to 481,600 oysters and about 486,000 young. During the progress of the work in the Sounds, there were twentJ·-four counts made of the dredgers in sight from the vessel. In ordPr that some idea may be formed of the uumher of OJ·sters taken by tlicse dredgers, an estimate bas been made, based upon Table II, of the rmmber of bushels a11d youug carried off the heds. In forming the estimate, all the, vei,;sels in the Sound were divided into three classes-the first being an assemblage of all the different craft, the second only the smaller classes, aud the third, where al>out two-thirds were small, and the remainder large craft. The number of sail counted was then placed in one of these classes, we having observed when among the dredgers the particular class and size of vessel usually working o\·er a particular ground. In order to ascertain the number of bushels to each vessel, the total number of bushels brought in (2,408) was divided bJ· the number of sails (57), which would. give 42 bushels as the average to a sail. A closer estimate is obtained from Table II, where the number of bushels assigned to each craft is that given h,r their master. The total number of bushels (-551 ), di \'ide.d by the number of sail (12), giv-es 45 and a fraction as the number of bushels to each sail. I have dfrided by 12 instead of 11, because the last number in Table II was the result of two days' dredging. The average number of bushels per sail for the second class, by Table I, is 16.6 bushels; by Table II, 17 bnshels. The average for the third class is, by Table I, 29 bushels; by Table II, 33 buHhels. In all cases the smaller numbers have lleen used in calculating the number of bushels of oysters. The total number of bm;hels taken from the beds in both Sournls in thirteen days was 47,842, and allowing from 150 to 200 OJSters to a bushel (though the number is probably larger), there would be rt' moved from the Sounds in the very first of the season from 7, 176,300 to 9,568,400 oysters. This, however, is far below the real number, as the entire area and number of sail were not visible at the same time. Iu order to f'lltimate the number of oysters removed from the beds in each day, I have divided the Sounds into four sections. The first section comprist>S all of Tangier Sound 11orth of Little Island and the Mussel Hole Bed. The second section comprit-1es all of that part of the Sound, including the Manokiu and Big Annemessex Rivers, between Little hi1and and Jane's Island. The third section comprises all of Tangier Sound south of Jane's Island. The fourth secti-On all of Pocomoke Sound.

Though there were dredgers in large numbers at work early in September arnl also many dur· iag the entire 1mm111er, ~·et iu order that an;v error may be under, rather than over estimation, I will consider the working season to be-from the 1st of October to the 1st of l\Ia.r and allow three days in each week for bad weather which would prevent dredging. That allowance will leave 120 working days, and in that time, by the preceding table, over 184,600,000 o;n·ters woultl lw removetl from the beds in the Sounds, snpposing them to supply the same number dt1ring the entire season. By Table Il it will he seen that the average number of young to a bnshel was 202. That number represents the number of young oysters attached to the shells of the full-grown ones that were removed from tlie beds. That the estimate is not a born what is actually the case I am certain from the immense unmbers of .rnuug brought up by our own dredgiug operations. Iu making up the estimate 20 and 30 young were frequently found on one shell, aucl in one case 54 were counted. In estimating the tota,l r.umber remove<l from the beds in one day, oul~· those Yessels dredging 011 such beds as were known to have a large proportion of young upou them ha\·e been considered, and e\·en then the estimate reachC'S the astonishing figure of 1,238, 790. These oysters are those of from two to five mouths' growth, and may be said to have survived the most prt>carious portion of their existe111·e, their shells having hecomP hard enough to resist the drills to a c(·1-tain extent, and they being firmly attached t-0 the mature oyster, and in no danger of destruction _from anJ· cause to which it would not be equally expm1etl. Still, many of them would doubtless perish e\·en if un1listurbed, for though all oysters on the beds, mature or others, would sutler if exposed to unfavomhle condit.ious, yet many of those co11ditio11s would affect the young autl young growth to a greater degree than the mature and more hardy oysters. I will therefore suppose that 50 per cent. of tlw young taken up would never ham reached maturity, aud will also make another aud ,·ery liberal supposition, that by the 1st of April the young would ltave reached such a size as wonld make it prolitable t-0 open them. That woulcl make the working season, so far as the young were co11ccmc<l, 10! days, and the. number of young remov~d would amount in that time to 128,8:~4,000, of which about 64,417,000 would probably have attained their full growth. These ~·onug are a total sacrifice, never seeing the water again after their removal and generally perishing on distant or adjacent shell heaps. Many more are probably destroyed by carelessness in disposing of the old shells brought up by the dredge. The dredging is usua,lly across the bed, and the shoal hard ridges noticed aloog the edges of the beds on the western side of Tangier Souutl and ou all edges at~jacent to rnmllly bottoms are no <louht caused by the dredgers, who, as they approach the edge of the bed, haYing dragged across it, haul in their dredges ju-;t before getting O\'er the muddy bottoms. They then stand on, tack or" wea_r," and as soon as ou the bed drop the dredges again. fo the mean time the crews have been busily "culling" the oysters, aud, as likely as not, have thrown over on the soft mud a far larger number of young attached to the shells than tlle~· have taken off on the oysters. No account bas been taken of the number of mature or young oysrers removed by the tongers, and the estimates a.re rnts~l upon observations made at the oommencement of the fishing se11son, when, the prices being low, a smaller Jmmher of tlroogers would be at work; therefore, there is every reason to believe that the f'.stimnte of both classes of oysters is under rather tha.u above the real number removed. We have, thea, e.Nide from the ra.rnges of the drills, a Je.arly destruction of oT'er 64,ooo,ooo young ,.n4 tbe removal of 184,000,000 mature oysters to account for the detPrk-

Whether this extensive fishing is beyond the capacity of the beds or not, cannot be accurately stated; the only information on the sul1ject obtainable being the statements of the oystermen that the beds are deteriorating from that cause. But an estimation of tbc effect of excessive fishing may be formed by examining its results upon such beds in England and France as have records upon the subject. The most iustrudive of these are the records the production of tbe beds of Can<;ale Bay, 011 the northwest coast of I<rance, which exte11d m·er a period of sixty-eight .v~rs from 1800 to 1868. The beds in the lmy comprise an area of about rno acres, and from 1~00to1816 produced from 400,000 to 2,400,000 a year. This, however, was the period of the Napoleonic wars and the fishing was much disturbed by the presence of the English cruisers. During this time the beds became so thickly stocked that the oysters were in some place:s a yard thick. After the close of the war the fishing improved aud the o;r:sters were removed in larger and increasing numbers until 1843. From 182:3 to 1818 it is supposed that the dredgers were living upon the o:n1ters accumulated during the period of enforced rest, from 1800 to 1816. In 1817 the number of o~· sters produced was i'i,(i00,000, and nut.ii 1843 there was a constant increase, the number taken iu the latter year bciug 70,000,UOO. In 1848 it was 60,000,000; tht"nceforward there was a constant decrease. From 1850 to 1856 the decrease was from 50,000,000 to 18,000,000, supposed to be the effect of overdredgfog. From 1859 to 1868 the decrease was from rn,000,000 to 1,079,000; the oysters having almost entirely disa1Jpeared from the beds, though on account of the sufiering condition of the inhabitants of the shores it was alnm~t impossible to prevent it. In 1870 there was a complete wreck of the bottom which could only be remedied b,y a total }Jrohibition of the fisheries for several years. From the beds of the district:; of Rochefort, Marenncs, and island of Oleron, on the west coast of I·'rance, there were takeu in 1853-'54 10,000,000 oysters, and in 1854-'55 15,000,000. On account of exhaustive fishing, in 18G3-'64 only 400,000 could be obtained. According to the testimou~- of Mr. 'Vebber, mayor of Falmouth, England, about 700 meu, working 300 boat:s, were ern11loyed in a profitable oyster fishery in the neighborhood of Falmouth until 1866, when the old laws euforciug a "close time" were repealed, under an impression that, owing to the great productive powers of the oyster, it would be impossible to remove a sufficient 11umber to prevent the re-stocking of the beds. Since 1866 the beds have become so impoverished from excessive and-continual fishing that in 1876 only 40 men and 40 boats could find employment, and small as the number is, they could not take more than 60 or 100 oysters a day, while formerly, in the :same time, a boat could take from 10,000 to 12,000. According to the statement of Mr. Messum, an oyster dealer and secretary of an oyster compauy at Emsworth, England, made before the Commission for the Investigation of Oyster Fish. eries, in l\Iay, 1876, there were in the harbor of Emsworth, between the years of 1840 and 1850, so mauy oyst~rs that one man in ffre hours could take from 24,000 to 32,000. In consequence of overfishing·, iu 1858 scarcely teu vessels could find loads, and in 1868 a dredger in five hours could not find more than twenty oysters. The oyster fisheries of Jer:sey, in the English Channel, afforded employment to 400 vessels. In six or seven years the dredging became so extenshre and the beds so exhausted that only three or four vessels could find employment, and the crews of even that small number had to do additional work ou shore in order to support themselves. The foregoing are a few of, though by no means all, the instances that may be quoted in order to show the disastrous eftects of overworking the beds, and in concluding the 'remarks under that head it will be instructive to extract from Professor Mobius' work his prophecy with regard to our own beds, which is here introduced: "In North America the oysters are so fine and so cheap that they are eaten daily by all classes. Hence they are now, and have been for a long time, a real means of subsistence for the people. This e1n-iablf: fact is 110 argument against the injuriousness of a continuous and severe fishing of the bedi,;. · · · But as the number of consumers increases iu America the price will also surely advance aud then there will arise a desire to fish the banks more se\·erely than hitherto, and if they do not accept in time the unfortunate experience of the oyster cultnrist.s of Europe, they will surely find their oyster beds impoverished for having defied the biooonotic laws." The question now ro be deeided is how the :proteetlon of the beds aJld their improvement ts to

be brought about. The protection laws of the State of .Maryland, which govern the larger part of the Sounds, are, hrietly, as follows: Dredging is allowed from October l to J\:lay 1. Taking of oysters in otller ways from September 1 to Mar 1. Dredging is not allowed iu the ri,·ers and creeks of the Sounds or in their mouths. No steam dredges are allowed. All dredgn1-1 ancl "tongers'' nmst be licensed. Violations of the law are punished by not more than two years imprisonment nor $200.Jine. For the enforcement of these regulations there is established a State Fishery Force, cousisting of oue steamer and seYeral small sloops; one of the latt1T ltm·iug jnrisdidiou on'r Tangier and Pocomoke Sounds. The officers of this Fisher;\· Force and the sheriffs and coustables of the different connties are empowered to make arrests and enforce the law. 'l'he a hove is the amount of protectiou ammle<l by the law if carried out. In the Sonuds, in reality, there is no11e. ~either the State Fishe.t:y Force, sheriffs, constables, or any other persorn; make arrests or enforce the law, the public opinion of the community being against such a proceeding, though every one recognizecl the necPssity when considered in the abstract. I ha\·e seen nurnl>ers of dredgers at work and the police boat cruising among them, a!l(l this was during the latter part of Augw;t, when, if at an.Y time, the oysters should ham been free from disturbance. Before deciding upou the measure of protection to be giveu to the beds, it ma.r be well again t-0 see what bas been accorded by foreign gonrnments and with what success. On tile ScllleswigHolstein banks the "close time" is from tlle 9th of May to the 1st of October; no oysters less tlian 2~ inches in length are removed at any time. The law is enforced, and 1-till the beds are deteriorating. In Ireland, the "close time" is from May 1 to September 1, ail.din some lomtlities of the coast from the 1st of April and the h;t of Uarch until the ht of October and the !st of Xm"em&er. It is unlawful to dredge or have in possession any oysters or oyster brood during the "close time.'1 The inspector of fisheries can call a meeting of interested persou:;; to decide npon a change of ''close time." Inspectors are empowered to permit the planting of oysters and. t-0 prohibit the presence of dredges on board an.v boat during the "close time.'' The coast guard and constabulary are empowered to enforce the laws, and violators arc suitably pnnhshed. The deep-sea fisheries for oysters ia the English Channel are governed by rules adopted by England and France. The "close time'' is from the 16th of June to the :nst of August. An.r boat having a dredge, or other implement used for taking o.rsters, duriug that tinw, is considered as having violated the law. Competent courts of each country have power to punish oft'ender8 and the cruisers of each nation power to enforce the law, which is strict!;\- ohsern~d by t.he F1·ench fishermen and f'reqoontly violated by the English. In France the oyster beds are protected hy stringent and effective laws, which ma~- be briefl.Y stated as follows: The government assumes control over all oyster banks a11<l fore shores. As occasion may seem t-0 req~ire, an entire bank, or part of it, may be reserYed fnun dredging for a certain time, decided by the local commission. The general practice seems to be to lmoy off a third or fourth of a bank each ;year, which portion is onl~· sufficiently dreclg·ed to remo,·e weeds, mud, vermin, &c.; the remainder of tl1e bed is opened to all licensed pen1ous for a ct'rtaiu specifiecl time; the following year another part, of the bank is reserved, and -0ccasiom1lly parts are resen·ed for a longer period. The local commission decides all matters pertaining to thl· bed1' and their vicinit~·, and is composed of the following officers: The im·pect-0r of the fisheries, tlie commander of the fishery guard, two "Gardes-Jlaritimes," one fisherman, master of a boat. , The following are the most important regulations made for the gui<lance of the commissions b,v the minister of the marine: The heds should not be opened for fishing nntil the spat has acquired strength to resist the action of the dredge; until the eud of January, for example. When a bed has well establislled breeding capacities, a fourth or fifth part of its total area shouhl be set apart as a reserve, and dredging over such part entirely prohibited. A fi8hery-guard boat should, whene\·er practicable, take part in the working of each bed. When a bed is foul or .encumbered with "·eeds or other matter noxious to the development or adherence of spat, it shoultl be open for dredging until cleaned. Beds on wliich there is neYer any production of spat shall be opened all through the season. After the working of any bed is over, it should be carefully inspected and, if necessary, the cult.ch replenished. 'l'he "close time" is between the 1st of May and the 31st of August, and is strictly observed. The foregoing regulations bave caused a great improvement in the ~ds on

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE
the French coast, aud the regulations of other nations have been made and enforced in time to prevent the depletion of their beds. As an mstaIJ(~e of the effect of this protectini policy, when understandingly conceived and rigidly enforced, the beds in the Hay of Arcachon are a good example. In 1870, through overfishing, they bad become entire]~- exlrnusted; but, by the strict protection afforded them, their fecundity has once more become so great (in 1876) that the waters of the bay from June until August are filled with the yotmg swarm. Ou a bed when dry, at low spring ebbs, comprising 26. 7 acres, there were taken by fort.Y or fifty persons, in about two and a half hours, tiO,OUO OJ·sters. That part of the bed was immediatel,y buoJ-ed, and 110 more fislling allowed during the season. Having seen what is coni'lidered necessary for the protection of the beds hy European uations, and why it is necessary, the question is, how we can best use their experience. The best remed,y for an~· evil is the removal of the cause, and we hM-e concluded that the cause of the evil in Tangier and Pocomoke Sounds is O\'er dredging aud the destruction of the young brood. Therefore, until the rate of production aud the proportion between the number spawned and the munber reaclling maturity is decided, only a specified number should he taken off of each bed in the Sountls. If obser,·ations, both as to the number rernove,1 arul the increase or decrease of the number to tlie square )'artl wt>re coutiuued, a basis might be found for the establishment of the maximum number to he remowd; but until that number is established no working of the beds should be permitted betweeu the middle of April aml the h;t of November, and none of the beds in Pocomoke Souud should be dredged over at all, except so much as it is necessary to clean them. There should be a sufficient number of oyster guiird-hoats to superintend the dredging, both in general and w~1en for cleansing purposes, to eollect statistics as to the number of young and mature o,ysters remove1l, and to make all observations as to tlie number to the square ,yard. They might also collect a good deal of other useful iuformation while on the beds. Duri11g September and October they should examine the beds, in ordn to ascertain the number of young, and those beds haYing a large proportion shonld be rest>rved from dredging operations until the young are ahlc to rPsii;t, the action of the dredge. No oy~ters below a certaiu size should be take11 off the beds, a11d it should he puuii,;hahle to have those under the specified size in possession. Wllenever it is jtidged that any bed open to general fishing is being worked beyond its capacity, the oyster guard should h1we power to prevent any further dredging on it. When any I.Jed with a large uumlX'r of -;. oung upon it is open, either the paekers or fishermen should be compelled, as far as JlOSsible, to return the shells to the beds, or the hard bottoms surrounding them, within a certain specified time, provided that the o;rsters were opened in their immediate vicinity. J,arge numbers of ~-onng would thus be saved, and the areas of the beds increased. No one should be allowed to take or to possess au oyi;ter having more than a speeified number of young attached to it. During the time when not otherwise em1ll0Jed, the o~·ster guard-boats coul'1 be usef'nll,y engaged in rernoYing Urn weeds alHl grass from the sand shoals aud tlle mo11s from the elosed beds. It must be remembered that dredging is not an unmixed evil. au1l that the impro\·ement of the oysters and the exteuded areas of the beds are mainlJ· due to it; but it should be condueted under suitable restrictions, and in this connection may he addsed the use of the scrape where it is now prohibited, and the prohibition of the heaYy dredges in shoal water aud on the sofr. bottoms. If there is au,y animal known to natlmilists that is an e11emy of the drill and uot harmful to the oyster, its introdnetion into the Sounds would he a great benefit; and, finally, if in the spring either the State or the fishermen would colleet the shells from the 11ilPs about the packing-houses and deposit them on the hard bottoms contiguous to the beds, thf'y would furnh~h an excellent "cultch '' for the ''spat," and probahl,y make a good catch and a permanent extension of the oyster ground., I ha,·e made the above suggestions with the hope that they ma.y in some way bear fruit for the benefit of those engaged in .i1e oyster fishery in the Sounds and Bay. Some more adequate protection than that now ottered must soou be afforded, or loss and distress among the la.nre number of f'eople in M:arJlaud arnl Yirginia engaged. in the fishery win soon follow from the failure (and that mo1·e or less suddm1) of the oyster industry. Iu conelmling this part.of my report, I cannot do better than to again quote l'rofesaor Mollins, whose remarks on the prei<ervation of natural banks of oysters are well worthy of attention:

UNITED ST.A.TES CO.A.ST .AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

319

"In conclusion, I hereby give as the foundatiou for all oyster culture the most important rules for the improYement of the natural oyster banks. "First. An oyster bank will yield permanently the greatest profit if it possesses such a stock of full-grown oysterR as will be sutlici!lnt to maintain the foeumlit~· of the bank in aceordance with its lJioconotic conditions. "Secoud. When the natural cowlitions will admit of it, the yielding capaeit~· of an oyster bed may be increased IJy improYiug and enlarging the ground for the reception of the young brood. The natural banks should be improved by remo,·ing the weeds and plants with dredges and properly c01rntructed harrows, and by scattering the slrnlls of oysters and other mussels o\·er the bottom. \Vlien circumstances will Ilermit, all the animal:s which are t.aken in the dredge, and which kill the oysters or use up their food, should be destroyed. It would be much more judicious and much better for those who eat oysters if the 'close time' could be extended until the 15th of Se1itember or the 1st of October, so as to allow the osst.ers some time after the eximlsion of the contents of the generative organs to become fat before being brought to the table. If it is desired that the oyster banks should remain of general ad rnntage to the public and a permanent source of profit to the iuhabitauts of the coast, the nulllber of oysters takeu from the beds ;yearly must not depend upon the demands of the consumers or be governed hy high price, but must he regulated sole!y and entirely by the amount of increase upo11 the ueds. The preserYation of the osster beds is as much a queistion of statesmanship as the preserYation of forests."
INVESTIGATION CONDUC'l'ED DURING 'IHE Sl:MMER AND AUTCUN OF 1879.

My assistants during this season were Master H. H. Barroll, U. S. N.; Ensign W. H. Allen, U.S. N.; .Mr. W. E.W. Hall. l\ir. Barron had charge of the eompilation and arrangement of the statistics collect~~d, and, in the field, general charge of the work during the ahseuce of the chief of the party. l\ir. Allen calculated the number of oyisters to the squarf'. yard, and the ratios between the classes; he also tested the water specimens and developed the cunes illustrating the changes and rouge of density. Mr. Ifall was charged with the care and arrangement of the records so as to facilitate their study by myself and others.
INSTRUCTIONS.

'l'be instructions of the Superintendent, issued J uue 30, 1879, dt~sired that the Yessel and party should proceed, as soon as possi!Jle, to the lower Oliesapeake Bay, and coutiuue the irffestigation begun and prosecuted during the previous season. The instructions were. concise, and, being supplemented by Yerual ones, were expressed in general terms. It was inteurle!l that the !icope of the investigation should include as much of that called for in the instructions for the previom; season and such additional matter as the judgment and experience of the chief of the party should dictate. The Yessel sailed from Baltimore, Md., for Tangier Sound on .July a, 1879, and the field work was completed Oil the 30th of October, when she arrived at Phila~lelphia, Pa.
PLAN OF WORK.

In devising the original plan for the work of the season it wm; expected that, not only would the party be much larger than it actually was, but that it would be in the field much earlier in the season. This original plan was, briefly, as follows: One division of the part~·, in a small stea:mer, was to continue the delineation of the beds aucl the search for Rtich new ones as might exist. The extension of the survey was to be from Tangier Sound along the eastem shores of the bay. The other division of the party was, in the Palinurus, to continue the study of the beds already surveyed, the conditions affecting the oysters, and determine, if possible, the effoot of changes of temperllture and density upon the [lroduction and subsequent life of the spat aml mature oyster. They ·were also .to ascertain what was the increase in size of the oyster in a given time, and deter· mine the number of oysters surviving in each successive period of life, or establish the natural ratios between the different classes. It w1.1.s also intended that this branch of the party should

obtain, if possible, satisfactory information in regard to the sex of the oyster, the method of propagation, the number of embryos spawned, and the habits of the animal during the early stages of life; or, in general terms, it was intended t,o ma.ke the study of the embryology of the oyster part of the work of the party. . It was proposed to continue this branch of the inquiry throughout the year, and to make, by means of self:registering thermometers and careful series of density obsen'ations and chemical analyses, au exhaustive studj- of the character and changes of character of tlu~ water surrounding the animals on the beds. Another division of the party was to undertake the collection of statistics, and was to visit and inspect all tlie dredging vessels and packing houses, that some >alue might he assigned the dred~ing factor, to wliich most of the evils affecting the beds appeared to be due. The smallness of the annual' appropriation made it impossible to carr.r out the original plan, which was accordingly modified; and the want of fuutls, which reduced the size of the part,y and scope of the work, also prevented our getting into the field before July 1. Thus the opportunity for studying the embryology of the osster and many other matters of interest relating to the reproductive processes was unavoidably lost. It was decided, however, to attempt the execution of the origiual design so far as was possible with the diminished force and time at our disposal, but upon our arrival at Crisfield, Md., it was found necessary to again modify and change our plan, or else. duplicate au iuYestigation that had already beeu undertaken and ably executed. Members of the .Johns Hopkins Zoological Laborator~· ha(l been established at Crisfield for some months prior to ms arri>al, a11d Dr. W. K. Brooks bad begun the stud;r of the emur~'ology of the oyster, had ma1le experiments in impregnating the ova with the spermatozoa, nnd liad succeeded t-0 some exteut iu raising the oyster from the egg. The study of the emhr,yolgy of the oyster was thus not only uudertaken but concluded, so far as was possible, duriug· that season. The results were alike surpnsiug, interesting, and Yaluable, aml, l1M'ing been accomplished by so able a worker, did not need auy confirmation at our hands, and as it was his intention to continue his experimeuts iu tlrn future and trace the development of the oyster up to tl1e point of attachment, I wrote to the Superiutendent proposing a new scheme for the season, which met with his approYal, and which contemplated the abandonment of all investigation of the embryological life of the o~·ster. The work of the party during this season was, properly, the collection of such information as would conduce to correct answers to the following questions: 1st. \Vere the oyster beds improving or deteriorating? 2d. ·what were the causes for such improvement or deterioration~ 3d. How is the <foterioration, if existing, to lJe prevented and the beds improved? Ju the endeavor to answer these questions it was necessary to investigate many problems and to collect much informarton having apparentls but little bearing upon the rnaiu question, but it was my ende:1vor to limit the extent of the inquiry as much as possible an<l to direct all tlie ener· gies of the party to the decision of the three points mentioned. Though. the biolog,y of' the o~·ster should be studied, yet only so much of it was essential to the work be had undertaken as would ai;sist in tlie solution of the problem presented, and consequently it was desirable to leave an extended investigation in that line to others and to settle ourselves only .such points as would, as far as we could see, directly assist us in arriving at correct conclusions. The investigation conducted during the summer and autumn of 1878 had shown that the beds were deteriorating rapidly, aml so far as could be seen the principal cause for this deterioration was the over-fi;;hing of the beds. Tb.e remaining question to be answered was, then, bow thedete· rioration was to be prevented. The main cause was decided to be excessive fishery, ";hich, by removing too large a number of mature brootl oysters, diminished in a constantly increasing ratio the fecundity of the bed. Other causes operated also to some extent, but their effects were inconsiderable. There is but one method of maintaining the fecundity of the beds, and that is by protection, but this protection can be afforded in several ways: Either by restrict.ing the fishery, by enlarging the field for the dredgers, or by insuring the maturity of a larger number of oysters, by artificially

impregnating the ova of the female and protecting the resultant embryos during those periods when they are unable to protect themselves. To afford protection and maintain the fecundity of the bed in the last-mentioned manuer has been attemped by Dr. W. K. Brooks, and his efforts have been in a measure successful. The ova has been impregnated, and the life of the resultant embryos has been maintained for ntr~·iug periods, the maximum being six days. Whether this success will l>e of practical benefit remains a matter of conjecture, but should it prove practicable to thus assist nature in maintaining the beds at their greatest productiveness, it will require extended experiments before we can feel assured that the protection afforded in this manner will be sufficient. To confirm the opinion a;; to the deterioration of the beds; and to show the best method of protecting them in the two remaining ways, has been the endea\'Or of the party under my command, and to that result ha Ye our efforts been directed. In the absence of positive and correct information as to the life and habits of the o~·ster, all legislation rdatiug to their protection must be to a great extent iuoperafrrn and uon-produ"ctive of the desired results, and uutil such information has been obtained the best and easiest remedy for the deterioration would be an extension of the known fishing gronu(l; in other words, the discm·ery of new and well-stocked beds; as, the number of dredgers being, at least for a few years, constant, they will naturally seek the most profitable field for labor, and leave the ornrworked beds for the newly-discovered ones, thus giving the former a chance for recuperation. That tilis is the case is e\ ident by the record of statistics, most of the dredging vessels working on the uew beds outside the Sound and on those in the Potomac Hiver on account of the poor returni,; gi,·en by the beds iu Tangier and Pocomoke Souuds. The protection afford. d in this manner would, however, be but temporar~·, the demaud for oysters constantly increasing, and the number of vessels working liable to increase with it; consequently it may soon he necessary to legislate for the direct protection of the beds and to limit the supply by law before it is stopped entirel,y !Jy nature. It is well, therefore, for the best iuterests of all clasi>es, that such an amount of information should be collt'cted, as to the character of the beds and oysters and the general conditions under which they advantageousl,\· live, as woul!l direct protective laws into a chaunel productive of most good. The first necessary information t-0 he obtained, and that of greatest moment, would be a knowledge of the positions and areas of the beds. No law could be passed which would protect a bed wbOde position and boundary was not at least approximately known, nor could any stud~- of separate beds or comparisons of many be undertaken without such knowledge. Again, since nature has already selected these areas as those most favorable to the growth and life of the oyst._.r, they eYideutly are the best grounds upon which to deposit the young brood, should the experiments of Dr. Brooks prove successful and of practical importance. Indeed, it is hardl~· possi!Jle to enumerate all the ad,;antages of knowing the positions and areas of the natural beds, and it may safe!,\· be said that a thorough study of the oyister question would be impossible without it. Of next importance is the knowledge when the bed is in the condition of greatest fecundity. In the attempt to attain this knowledge the number of oysters to the square yard of the surface was ascertained during the season of 1878, as described by me in my previous report. The reimlts were of comparative value, and subsequent operations in each ,year were to show whether the oysters on the bed were increasing or diminishing; or, in other words, the fecundity of the bed, as compared with previous seasons, was to be ascertained. During the last season these numbers have been again calculated in a similar manner; but, working with a greater knowledge of the subject generally, and a more correct estimate of the desired results, I have devised another method for ascertaining whether the bed is in its most productive condition. It is evident that in any large community there must he a certain ratio between the individuals of difterent ages, and that any change in this ratio will indicate an increased or decreased fecundity. It was not, and probably will not be for some time, possi!Jle to separate the oysters into clasi1es by ages, except in a very rude manner. The only iudicatiou of the age is the size of

the animal, and the o;rsters were, therefore, separated into four classes, according to size, in the following manner: The first class contained aH tliose over three inches in length, and embraced all full-grown, mature oysters. The second class contained o.vsters between 2 and 3 inches in length, and these were supposed to be mature and fit for market, and between two and three years of age. The third class contained oysters between three-quarters of an inch and 2 inches long, and represented the yonng growth of tlie preceding seasons, being thus oysters from six months to two years of age. The fourth class contained all oy1:1ters under three-quarters of an inch in length, embracing the most minute that could be recognized, and represented the young growth of the last spawning season, or those of less than a year's growth. B.'· obtaining a sufficient number of each class from each bed it was intended to establish ratios bf'tween ench class, whicl1, compared with ratios 011 new and comparatively unworked beds, would show whether t11e particular locality under examination was in a state of greatest productiveness or not, and by comparing the ratios of successive seasons, the increase or decrease, constant or otherwise, could be ascertained, and the yield of the bed in ensuing seasons predicted. In order to have another aml more correct standard for comparison and to arrive at certain conclusions as to whether the spatting in any season was general and extending to all beds, or confined to particular localities, and in order to know accurately the number of oysters surviving each period of their perceptive existence, numbers of spat collectors were deposited upon the ditforcnt beds. It was tbe intention to frequently inspect these tiles, and by counting tbe number of o~-sters on each tile at each examination the number of oysters surviving woul(l be ascertained and the age of the previously-established classes would be decided. Thus the life of a community of 03·sters, free from the dredging influence and protectecl from all but natural enemies, would be before us from the time of tlw finit attachment until they reached maturity. The study of their embryo life properly belongs to the zoological student, and the method of propagation and the successiYe stages of that life must he left to him to determine. It is valuable to the inquiry under consicleration, but not essential; as it is evident that we may neglect the early stages of life and yet arrive at correct conclusions as to the number of mature oysters neces. sary to support the beds in their best condition. ~ext iu importance to the knowledge of the absolute fecundity of the bed is a knowledg~ of tlwse conditions which would influence it, and in order that no cause for the deterioration should be neglected, and that all information bearing in any way upon the propagation and growth of the oyster miglit be collected, se\"eral matters of secondary importance have been subjected to investigation and tl1e results embodied in either this or my previous report. Included under this head areIm·estigations into the temperatures and the intluence of increased or diminished temperature upon the mature oyster and embryo. Investigations into the character of the water, especially a1; regards its increased or dimini1-1hed density. Investigatiomi into the character of the bottom and its influence upon the oyster. A dewrmination of the direction and velocity of the currents and such collection of statistics of the o;yster trade and fishery as would tthow its present condition and give a value to the <lreugiug factor; and, lastly: A collection and stud_y of the famnr1 of the beds, particularly of those animals supposed to affect the oyster. An attempt has also been made to collect tile experience of the oystermen. and dealers as to the habits of the oyster!I, and as to the effect of the various changes of environment. HaYing shown what, in my opinion, were the objects to be obtained and the direction which the investigation should pursue, it remains now to describe in detail the work of the party each branch of the inqnil"j· and to <lecide upon the value of the results.

Tl1e beds in Tangier and l'ocomoke Sounds were 1:mrveyed during the sea8on of 1878 aud described in m.r report of the operations of the partJ' during that ~·ear. During the last season the survey of the bells has been but an incidental part of the work, only such haviug been delineated as time and circum'stances would permit, thougl1 those I.Ying inside the Sounds han~ lweu su~jecte<l to an examina,tiou an<l survey similar to that of the 11revious season.
llEDf' IN THE XANTICOKE RIVER.

These are small and inconsiderable, embracing a total area of 827,000 square yards. Most of tht1m lie on the east-0ru side of the channel and extend a short distance a boYe Raggml Point, though detached groups may be found mnch farther up the river. The oysters and shells are uniformly spread over eacli snrfaf·e. Each bed is Yery hard, and in most cases the probe would not penetrate IJeyond six inches, bnt when it was possible to push through the surface stratum a substratum was found of sand. The main part of the ri\er bottom is of mud, a11d bottom of that description surrounds the beds. Aloug both shores tlw mud is firmer and of greater consistency than iu t!Je channel, and abm·e Roaring Point on tliose bottoms are placed lari.re numheri-1 of o~·sters transplan·ed from the Middle Ground Bed a11d from other localities. The river seems to be a fan>rite planting grouud, and number:s of boats and canrn"s werP working the Middle Ground Bed during the summer in or<lcr to obtain the "plants.'' The oysters are small, single and in small clusters, and not of ''ery good quality. The water being shoal, from 5 to 10 feet, uo dredging could be done 011 tl1est> heds~ am1 eonsequently tl!e number to the square yard has not been calculated.
BEDS IN '.l'HE LI'.l'TLE ANNE::lfESSEX.

There are only a few small beds in this river, and the,y are very seldom worked. Their total area is 464,000 square yards. The o~·sters are in detached groups, separated by spaces of mud and sand, and are small, single and in small clusters. The depth of water varies from 6 to 12 feet.
BEDS IN KEDGE's STRAI'.l'.

The bottom of Kedge's Strait, from the sands on one shore to those on the other, is covered with scattered oysters to greater or less extent, but they are found in greater numbers in the channel on the soft bottoms than elsewhere. The total area of the beds is 2,894,000 square yards, and three of the beds are of considerable size. The first lies on the northward side of the Strait, north of Solomon's J,nmp Light· House, south and southwest of the Western Islands. It extendi-1 in a \VNW. and ESE. direction (that of th1~ channel), and is 1! miles long and from one-eighth to one-half mile broad, aud is irregular in outline. Its area is 1,244,000 square yards. Due west of this bed, south of Oyster Creek and NNW. of Fog Point, is the second bed. It extends north and south five-eighths of a mile, and t>ast aud west one-third of a mile. Its area is 646,000 square yards. Southwest and west from this bed, aud northwest from Fog Point,, in the middle of t!Je Strait and west of the shoals, is the third bed. Its area is 550,000 square ,yards, and its greatest length NNW. and SSE. is three-fourths of a mile, with an average breadth of one.fourth of a mile. The depth of water on the inner bed is from 12 to 16 feet, and on the two outer 1mes from 14 to 19 feet. The oyst-Ors are spread i!l groups of different areas, separated by spaces of mud and sarnl, generally the latter, except close to the channel.wa~., where there is more mud. The beds arc in almost all cases very hard; when the probe would penetrate, soft sand was found. The inner be1l is much softer than the other two, and bas a larger amount of mud. The oyster8 were small and dark, single aud in small clusters of three or four, with no red sponge or grass. Un the outer bed" the shells were larger and cleaner than on tlie inner, and generally the oysters in the Strait are larger and with sharper bills than those inside.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE
INVES'l'IGATIOX OF '.l'HE CHESAPEAKE BAY WEST OF TANGIER .A.ND SMITH'S IHLANDS.

The only information tbat could be obtained with regard to the ground outside the Sounds was that there were a number of bed<> of differ.,nt areas l~·ing in the Bay, on the eastern side of the ship chaunt'l, especially about a11d on the shoals off Smith's Island and Kedge's Strait. The ground bt:'ing so little known, and the accurate delineation of tbe beds being so difficult wbeu attempted with a sailing yessel, 1 considered it bettt·r to employ the limited time at my disposal in running tentatirn lines, off and on shore, and other lines crossing them, with a \·iew to discover the location ot' the beds and to mark these localities for a more thorough and exbansti,·e investigation in the future. In accordance with this plan I dredged over the bottom of the Bay, from Tangier Island northward, running the lines sufficiently close to detect any beds of importance or the pret'lence of scattered oysters. The distance over which the dredge was dragged was alwa.}·s measured-; and, when the depth of water was not too great, the bottom was probed with a view of determining whether it was suitable for the oystt:'rs. By rpfereuce to tbe projections it will be seen tbat these areas occur quite frequently on the shoal ground making off in lt southwesterly direction from Tangier Island; that between Tangier Island and Cbeesman's lslamls there are, in tbe deep water, no oysters; and that from abreast Cheesman's fala11ds as far north as the investigation extended were found large areas upon which oy:sters were liYing, and in some cases iu great numbers. The depth of water does not appear to inflnence the formatiou or growth of these beds, some of them l_yiug on the shoals and others iQ. deeper water. Geueralls speaking, here as in the Sounds, the origi11al becls were formed on the side of the shoals, and wherever there was a sudtlen change of bottom. \Vherever the solid beds or "Rocks" were encountered, they were found to be long and narrow ridges, extendi11g generally in a northerly and souther!~- directiou, excPpt when near Kedge's Strait, where they ran more to tile eastward and westward; and we could, in standing across the beds, hut rarely obtain more than one or two hauls of ti.le dredge lwforc we were off tlie ''Hock." The major axis appears here, as elsewhere, to lie in tbe direction of the current, and probably all natural extension and growth of any bed are in that direction, the 8pat being carried backward and forward by the ebb and flow of the tides. The large number of beds near and off Kedge's Strait is probably dne to the large number of spat brought ont from the Sounds through the Strait. The bottom is generally of hard sand covered with sponge a11d grass. Near Kedge's Strait some mud sloughs were found, and in some cases the substratum of the beds was of clay; but in most of them the stratum of oysters and shells was too thick and hard to be penetrated. The beds outside the Sounds ha>e been comparativel;y free from dredging, and thus present marked differences from those inside. 'l'hey are comparatively longer and narrower, and much more sharply defined. Very few scattered oysters are found near them, and the beds are much more solid, unbroken, and muvh llarder, requiring heavier dredges than tltose used in the Sounds. The most remarkable difference is, howeYer, in the shape and growth of the o.rsters. On the undredged beds the,Y are long and narrow, with the lower shells rnry deep, and bills Yer.r thin aml sharp. In no case did we find any single oysters of any class, but all grew in clusters of from three and four to twelve and fifteen. The shells were clean and white, and free from mud aud sand. Generally there was found a tuft of red or white sponge attached to the clusters, and the mature first and second class oysters were covered and the inter:stices between them filled with those of the third and fourth classes; numbers of barnacles were also found, antl some crl'pidula, but t1,bicola. were present only in small numbers. The oysters found upon beds that have been much worked differ materially, being single and broader in comparison to their length, round and with blunt bills. They are usuall.r dark in color, and have a con~iderable amount of mud and saud 011 the shells. The sponges do uot appear to be as abundant, awl the amount of dredging on any bed may always be known by the appearance of the oysters brought up. Upon an overdredged and almost exhausted bed the oysters will be large and single, blunt-hilled, with dirty shells, and with an almost entire absence of sponges, barnacles, and crepidula ; but the shells will be covered with tubioola and bored in many places by the boring pholad.

Late in the last spring the dredgers begau working on the beds immediately off Kedge'" Strait and the one off Hog Neck, ancl during the present season the returns show that the heds in the Sound1:1 haYe been, to some extent, abandoned for those outside in the hay. As so little dre1lging was done before my examination, I tliink the n'snlts of the dredging operatio11s of the part~ may be considerrd as outaiued from unworked bed1:;. Th!'se rp1mlts will lJP alluded to subsequeutlr.

The above table of the number of oysters to the square ~·anl has been compilerl from all observations made in the bay where there was any e\·idence of a bed exhiting, sudi evidence being given by the probe, soundings, and character of the matter brought up by the dredge. Tile numbers to the square .:yard harn been calculated in a manner similar to that described in my previous report, and are, as was pointed out iu that, report, only of valtie as forming a standard for comparison. It must be borne in mind, howe\·er, in making such comparison, that the liard· ness of the nnworked beds aud the closeness of the growth of the oysters would preYent as many being taken by the dredge as on the softer and more ope11 he<ls in the Sounds. By referriug to the table, it will he seen that the number calculated for each locality is verJ nearly the same as that arrived at by comuining all the obser,·ations, and that this nmn her is about 0.4 to the square yard. Accepting that as tlw standard, the number to the square yard upon a bed which has heeu dredged for some time should certaiul.r not fall below 0.4, and considering the difforent characters of the bottom, the nnm ber, as shown by the dredgP, u1ion an old bed, should he much larger, unless the bed has been oYerworhed. The following table shows the number of o,ysters of each class examined, and also the number of bushPls brought up and the percentage of shells and debris to the whole amouut. As will be seen by the table, the number of the fourth class of this year's growth is ver.1 large, showing that however bad the season may have been inside the. Smrnds it has not influenced the re.production in the bay. TABLE I.-Dredging result:s-Clie:sapeake Bay.

REPORT OF TRE Str:PER!NTENDENT OF TRE

In the foregoing table tht:' ground dredged over has been divided into parallel sections, and all oysters from the beds in thost:' sections lm>e been assembled togetht>r. Section l includes all the beds west of Kcdge's Strait. Section 2 the beds west of that position on the ch::irt marked Red House. SPction 3 the beds west of that position marked White House. Section 4 t.be heds west of Hog Neck and Cheesman's Island, and section 5 the beds west of Tangier Island. In compiling the tables I have entered only those hauls of dredge that have been taken on the befls or wbere the 03sters were in considerable numbers. The scattered and detached groups and single oysters ha\ce not, been considered. Section 5 is not an important one, owing to the very small areas of all the beds encountered on it. By examining tl1is table it will be seen that a total of 54 bushels, amounting to 21,183 oysters, were examined; that from 200 hauls of the dredge we obtained 78.3 bushels of oysters and' shells, and that 31 per cent. or 21.3 bushels of this matter consiste:l of shells or other (Mbris, and this percentage does not differ materially from that found on each section. Section 5 is not considered, as tbe percentage there does not entirely represent shells and other debris of the bed, but rather the sponge and grass of the sand shoals. Regarding these beds as in their natural condition of healthy life, it is inferred from the deduced table that, other things being equal, a larger percentage of debris would indicate that the bed was not gi vi11g, for the same amount of labor, its natural retnru; or, iu other words, that the mass of old shells brought up by the dredge was out of proportion to the number of oysters. This percentage is of value as indicating the most profitable working grounds, and also as indicating, · when very large, that the bed bas been overworked and its population destroyed, as the percentage of shells bears the same relation to the oysters as the unoccupied dwellings in a city do to its inhabitants; au increased percentage means a decreased population. It is evident that there should be a certain ratio between the oysters of different ages, and in general terms the number of young should exceed the mature, thus allowing for the natural depletion in each period of growth. Our present knowledge, however, is not sufficient to allow the assignment of exact values to this ratio, and the ratios between the different classes are too irregular, owing to the variations in tlle spawnings in the several seasons, to allow their acceptance as a standard. One thing, however, may he astmmed as au axiom, and that is, that the number of young growth on a bed i;hould always exceed the mature oysters, for if there are no young oysters in the community there will soon be no old ones, and as there is a constant depletion of each class, the young must sufficiently outnumber the old to allow those ravages and still adequately supply the denrn.nd and fill up tbe vacant places in the higher classes. An inspeetion of Table I will showlst. That 75 per cent. of the fourth class were of this year's growth. 2d. That the ratio between the third and fourth classes is th~ largest, and between the second and tbir1l classes the smallest. As the second class represents oysters of between two and three years of age, and as the ratio between the sec011d and first classes is large, I judge that there was a successful spatting on these beds in 1876; aud as the third class represents, on tbe whole, oysters of the season of 1877 and 1878, and as the ratios between those of that class and those of the second is small, I infer that tbe seasons of 1877-'78 were bad spawning ones. Again, the fourth class is principally of this year's growth, and the ratio of fourth to third class is large, from which I infer-what was the ease-that the spatting of the la:,;t season on these beds was successful. As already explained, the third and fourth classes practically represent the offspring of three successive spatting seasons, and thus contain the young growth on the bed, while the tirst and second classes represent the mature oysters. lf, then, we compare the mature with the young, we ba\e at once a sure indicat,ion of the stare of the bed so far as its fecundity is concerned. In order that the areas under consideration might be as similar as possible to the extensive

By reforring to Tabie I it will be seen that on all the beds in Tang'ier Sound, from Fishing Bay down to the Ureat Rock, with oue exceptiou, that of Chain Shoal, the maximum ratio is that of the second class to the first. The inforeuce is that then· was a successful spatting season on all the upper beds in l8ifi or 1877, prohahly the former. Again, the minimum ratio, a;; far clown the Sound as the Mud Bed, is tbatof the third class to the second, showing that on the beds aboye the Mud Bed there was not a successful attachment in 1878, wliich was tlie case as attested by onrseh-es. The remaining· ratios on these beds show that there has betm some attachment during the present season. LeaYiug the Chain Shoal Bed for the present, the minimum ratio on all the remaining beds is that of tlw fourth class to the tllir1l, showi11g that there has been but little attachment of young llurin~ the season of 1879. The remai11ing ratios show that tllere was a partial attachment of young on the beds between Turtle Egg Islaud Bed and the Great Hock during 1878, aw.1 a partial attachment on the remaining be(h> north of Jaue's Island dnl'ing 1876 or 1877, while there was a successful spatting on those lower beds dnriug 187.-;, which conclusion wa8 fonml to be correct by our observations during t.hat season. Arranging these deductions in 1abular form, we have the following:

I find the ratio of young growth t-0 mature oysters to be, generally speaking, a constantly increasing one from the head of Taugier &mnd to the last section. In my report of the investigation carried ou in 1878, I called attention t-0 the noticeable absence of ''young" on the beds above Piney Island Bar and Kedge's Strait, and to tlte large attachment on the southern beds, and the ratios in Table II begin increasing materially 011 thol'le beds whe1·e there was a successful attachment of young 9uring the previous season. Rieferring to the "Spatting Table," it will be seen that on the upper soot ion there has not b(Wll a successful attachment since 1876-'77; hence, the mature oysters from two to three years old, tl1e S.

growth of those seasons, shoul!l be iu the ascendant naturally, and hence the small ratios on the upper section. Apparently the ratios should be about the same on the middle section, as its successive spatting season was afao in 187fi-'77; but the moderately succt-ssful season was in 1878, while on the upper sActiou it was in 1879; and as brood oysters are constantly taken from the beds in constantly increasing nurn hers it follows that the yield of each succeeding year will be less. As an a1lditio11al cause, mure of the beds in the upper section are worked dmfog the summer than in the others. During the .season of 1878 there was an extraordinary growth of young on Harris' bed, which accounts for its large ratio, and the increasp, of the other ratios over those of the first section is due tn some extent to the attachment of the season of 1878. On the lower section the ratios are very Ltrge by reasou of the successful attachment in 1878, aud the hnt moderate success of the seasons of 1876-'i7. The ntriatio11s in the ratios can thus be accounted for hy the success or failure of different spatting seasons, a11d 110 doubt this success or failure has its intluence, but that its effects are not iurnriable c~w be seeu b.r reference to the ratios of Po11omoke :Sound. \Yith the exct'ption of Parker's Bed, a small bed lyii1g near Watt's Island and which bas not been dredged as extensively as the others in Pocom1Jke Sound, we find the ratio of young growth to mature oysters exceedingly small. In no case do the former predominate. From this, according to the deductions from the Tangier beds, it wollld be inferred that the seasons of 1876 or 1877 were unusually succP>'sful ones for the attachment of the spat, and that subsequently there has been no successful season. By referring to the spatting table we find, however, that the spatting season of 1876 or 1877 was 011 the whole uusuccessfnl, and the seasom; subsequent ham either been successful or moderately so, and this conclllsio11 is supported by our ohservations during 1878. But as the success or non-success as shown by the spatting table is comparat,ive only, we can only assume .that whether successful or uot the attachment was uot sufficieut as one exi>lauatfon of tile small ratios fountl in Pocomoke. Consequently the variation in the success of different spatting seasons is not sufficient to explain unusual and abnormal changes in the ratios of the young growth to the m~1ture oyster. It is evident that tile removal of a large num her of mature oysters from a bed would show apparently an increased fecun·lity, by increasing the ratio of yonug growth to mature oysters, and this appllreut incre~tse would be observable for at least two years, or until the young growth becaa1e in turn mature, when, as the reproduction would naturally be diminished by the remo\·al of the l>ruod oysters and com1equently there would be a smaller numher of young growth, and as the young growth of the previous year would be in that time mature, the ratio would sucldeuly turn in the opposite way, and be as abnormally small as it had been almormally large. Once having takeu this turn, and the fishing still cont.iuuing, the ratios would. constantly 1lecrease. A few titictuatio1rn might occur now and then, but the general tendency would be a diminishiug oue. Nature arranges her own laws of supvly and demand, and the ratios she establishes between the differt-.11t ch1sse>1 iu any community are most likely to be the necessary oues, and such are the only ones that can he accepted as stamlar<ls. We 11a\'e established that upon the auworked beds i11 the Bay the ratio of ;rouug growth to mature .oysters is about 1.5, but as this is the result of but one season's observ.ttions, and those °''er a somewhat limited area, it would be rash to accept that staudard exactly or to draw rigid inferences from comparison with it. Therefore, in order to allow a sufficient margin for the variations of different seasons and localities, it will .be better to cousider the uormal ratio as betwe1·n I and .:!, aud consequently 1wy increase or decrease of that ratio will be au indication of diwiuisbed fecundit,y, and, all things remaining the same, the eventual destructmn of the lwds. Uompariug the ratios of the beds in the Sounds with that established as a standard, we find thatlst. All beds abo\"e the Grass Tangier fall below the minimum ratio. !!d. That tlle gronps iuclu<ling Tangier Grass aud Muacle Hole are within the limit, as are the beds in the Manokin and Big Annemessex Rivers and the Woman's .Manh Bed.

The number of oysters t-0 the square yard ascertained, as described in my report of the investigation of 1878, has been calculatecl for each bf·d, ancl the results tabulated, togt:'ther with those of the previous sea..'lon, for convenience of comparison. Though a standard has been established by the number found on the unworked beds in the bay, no comparison, except in one wa,\', is just, the conditions of bottom aud difference of growth upon the worked and unworked beds differing so materially. The number on any bed, ol>tained by the method we haYe used, will always be mucll less than what is really the catie, but they will be much less true on an uuworketl bed than u1>0n one which has been for some time snhjt>cted to dredging influences, and whl're the bottom is soft and yielding, and the oysters gro\\ sin,:rly or in small cln.iters itu;tead of being cemented together ancl to the surface stratum, as they are on the undre1lged beds.

one. How much so it is impossible to say, but it is evident that a smaller number would indicate a failure of the mature oysters. ln calculating therm numbers only first and second class oysters have been considered. It will be seen by the table that on all the beds above Kedge's Strait there has been a IDl!-rked decrease in the number of oysters to the square yard. That on the remaining beds, with the exception of "\Voman's Marsh and .Johnson's beds, and considering the Thoroughfare beds as one, there has been an increase in the number of oysters. That on all the beds in Pocomoke Sound there has been a marked decrease. It will also be seen that 011 many of the beds the number falls below the standard of 0.4, that on none of them is it very much greater, and that, generall.v speaking, the numbers are less than the Htandard on those beds that show a gain upon the number established during 1878. It would appear, then, by oue comparison, that most of the beds have not a sufficient number of mature oysters upon them; and by the other, that however many were taken off, yet, nature could more than supply the demand. These inconsistent results may be the result of several caui,;es. The standard may be too high; but, as has been explained, if the beds are in equally good condition, the probability is that the dredge would bring up a larger number from the old than from the new beds. The smallnei,;s of the numbers on the lower beds may be due to the greater depth of water and ha.rdness of the bottom, though they do not difter greatly in that respect from the beds in the bay, however much fron1 those in the northern part of the Sound. It would not be wise to decide hastily, upon the evidence of the numbers to the square yard, that the beds are either deteriomtiug or the reverse, especially as the comparison has been of but, t,wo seasons. If, after they have been continued for some time, there should be au increased number shown, it may be considered differently; but, as all experience testifies to the deterioration of' the beds, the inconsistency of the results shown by the table can probably be explained in another way than by assuming the standard number to be too great, and this explanation will be subsequently attempted.
INFOR~lA.TION OBTAINED FROM "SP A.'l' COLLECTORS."

In order to ascertain when the first attachment of young took plaee on each bed, the comparative extent of such attachment, the influence of bottom and depth of water upon the attachment, and, finally, the increase in size of the oyster and the number surviviug each period of their existence, I placed early in .July twenty-four spat collectors on the beds in the Sounds; b11t I regret to say that the collectors were removed b_y some ill-disposed persons almost as soon as placed. The last hurdle, as the buudle of tiles was called, was in position on July 14, aud on July 15 only four remained in position, and after the 1st of August there was but one left (No. 7, in the Big Annemessex River). The hurdles were compostid of eight or sixteen half-round tiles, lashed on a wooden frame, and su arranged tha,t the frame rested on the bottom, the tiles being thus raised about six inches above the bottom. The tiles were ordinary earthenware ones, unglazed, and were always placed so as to have their concave side un<lerueatb. .As long as the hurdles remained in position they were frequently examined in order to ascertain' the advent of the young brood, and from those examinations I am of the opinion that the first attachment of oysters took place about July 17, as on that day we disco,·ered, with the aid of the microscope, oysters on Hurdle No. 12, ou Chain Shoal, and 011 the 19th, iu the same way, found them on No. 7, in the Big Annemessex. On July ~a they were observable on the hurdles on the Great Rock, both in shoal and deep water. Though the attachment probably began abont the middle of ,July, yet it was only evident on the tiles, as our dredging operations did not discover any attachment before the 12th of August, when the young brood were found in moderate numbers on all the beds in both the Sounds. The number found in Pocomoke Sonnd was much smaller t.han in Tangier, and the number on the Upper Pocomoke beds and ou the Muddy Marsh bed was smaller than on the lower ones. The attacl1ment appears to be proportional to the number of oysters, such beds as the Muddy Marsh, for instance, having very few young; b11t as the bed is badly broken up, this may be owing to tbe absence of proper cultch. The young appear to select the cleanest and smoothest shells for attachment, and we always found that tbe ·'boxes," or those shells which bad not been separated

completely, contained the largest number of young brood. We alsu found tliat the size of the yonng de.pended, to a great extent, upon the depth of water. Those first detected by us were from two millimeters to one centimeter in length, and as the shoal-water oysters spawn first, a11d as we found the young of the largest size in shoal water, I i11fer that the attachment of the oyster occurs very near the location of the parent. The hurdle in the Big Annemessex was suluected to four examinations. It was placed in JlOSition on July 9, and on J aly l!J, when the first examination Wa8 made, there were a few oysters on the tiles, but so small that a microscope was necessary in orde1· to recog11ize them. The secoml examination was on August 2, and tl1e oysters were then quite percepti l>le and easily counted. The total number of oysters ou the tiles was then 1,501); tletluetiug those on tile No. 7, which tile was removed, there were 1,177. The number on a tile varied g-reatly, the maximum being 348 and the mrnimum 26. 'l'be third examination was on the 23d of August. The oysters bad increased wr.r much iu size and in numbers. The total number on the tiles was now 1,334, showing an increase of 0.13 per cent. of the numbe1' at the second examiuat.ioo. The number on the lower side of the tiles was much larger than on the upper. A tile (~o. 2) was removed, and, deducting the number of oysters on it from the sum, there were 1,~02 still on the hurdle. A few oysters were injured, prob. ably by raising or lowering the hurdle from and to the bottom. Tl.Je fourth examination was on the 10th of October. The total umnher of oysters was then 539, showi11g a decrease of 55 per cent. At this examination ahout two.thir<ls of t!Je o_p;ters were of the thir'1 class, or owr three·quarters of an inch in length, and two of them were owr two inches l011g, being thus of the second class. All, howe\'er, could be distingnished as of \'er.r receut growth, being ver.v long and thin, with thin, delicate shells, easilr brokeu with the thumb-nail or point of a penknife. The largest 1rnmbers were still found on the lower sideR of the tiles. A moderate 11nmller of oysters had been iujure<l by rough handling. I infet· from the four inspections made of this hurdle, and from the one or two made of utheris IJefore they were removed, that the first attachment of young began, as I han~ said, about the middle of July, aud continued until abotlt the 20th of Ang11st, as on the 2:M of ti.mt month there was no indication of any recent. attachment. rrobahly it reaches its maximum 1wmber about the eud of July, aud decreai,;es aftt>rwards. 'l'he mortality after the 23tl of August was rnr,\- grPat, fully 50 per cent. perishing from some unknown cause, which, though unknown, is certainly natural. We did not 11otice any evidence of the destructiYe effects of drills or other animals, though their agency would only be discovered by the evidence of the boles in the upper ·alves, but as those valves were never present, it cannot be said with certainty that the destruction was not due to them. .What.ever the cause, the fact is that .50 per cent. perislied in tl1e first six weeks of their existence. The tiles ha\'e shown that the increase iu size is much greater than was snppoged, and are the first and only authentic evidence upon that point wltich has been produc(-'d with rt>g·n'd to the American oyster. Again, it is conclusively shown by these tiles and some others that were dredged up from the Woman's Marsh beds (Hurdle No. 24), that the greatest attachment is ou the lower concave side, and consequently that whatever may be the movements of the embryo oyster before attachment, during the period just prior to it they are near, if not on the bottom, and iu seeking· their place of attachment .they must rise. Iu this they are similar to the European rnriet.v. The selection of t!Je lower sides of the tiles and the interior of the "boxes'' may be an pJfort ot' nature to provide some protection for the young brood, by, to a certain extent, inducing tlwm to ·seek dark and secluded point~ for attachment, or tile large number found in such places may be due to the inability of the various eqemies of the spat to get at them when thus protected. It is a matter of very great regret ti.tat we have not a large number of specimens and observations for comparison, as all the future investigations in this field would be greatly assisted by an accurate knowledge of the rate of decrease in number and increase ju size of the oyster~, an<l it is to be hoped that the lturdle in the Big Annemessex will be allowe<l to remain in i)osition long enough to permit the meager, yet valuable, information it can produce t-0 be made public.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE
INVESTIGATION OF
T:l!~MPERATURES.

It was intended that a :self.reg·istering thermometer should be placed ou each hurdle, aud th~t the temperature to which the young were exposed should be noted at each examination. Fortunately, co11sidt>ring the fate of the hurdles, the therm(lmt>ters were not received in time to be ui:;ed as was intended, and after the disappearance of the svat collectors it was not considered advisable to expose the thermomett·r1o; to the same risks. About the last of Jul>·, however, I had the temperature of the 811rface water recor1lell eyery two hours, an1l considering that there is probably hut little variation in the limits of the Sound:,;, I ham plotted the acl'.omp:u1:ying curve of maximum and minimum temperatures from J nly :w to October 1. It will be seen that these curves are ,-ery irregular, aml that the greatest irregularities occur during the month of August, and that the greatest difference is between the 6th and 10th of August, one of 15° in four days. On the i;,th there is a change of 8°, and on the 28th of 120. About the 4th of Angnst I determiued to utilize the chanuel buoy~ as marks for the positions of thermometers, hoping that they might thus eRcape the observation of those who were iuclined to remo\'e them. Accor1li111.~l.r, we placed lour sdf-registerin~ tl1er111ometers on the bells; one at the foot of the buoy oil the Shark's Fin, one ou the lmo.v on Pim'.Y lslarnl Bar, one Oil the buoy off Watts' lsla1.d light-houst>, awl mw on the lrno.r off S,vke's Island, ahout the middle of Pocomoke Sound. 'Ye were enabled to make several examinations of these thermometers; but about the 1st of September, fiutliug that one had been stolen, l concluded to remove the others before they shared the same fate. The curves of maximum and minimum temperature given hy the;;:,e thermometerR, and also the range of Yariation, are shown on the same sheet with the curves of surface temperature. The tluwmometcrs 'wrc in place too late, and for too short a period, to allow any safe conclusio11s to bt> bai:.w<l npon the i11 formation gfren hy them; but it is noticeable, as an intert·sting coincidence, that the emTe8 of both surface and 1Jotto111 temperatures show the greatest variations ahout the time wlwn the ;1·01rng were what is known as ";;:,pat,'' or during the period of and just bP.fore attachment; tlw, yon11g on the Rl1oal he1ls pre8umahl,y :tttaching by early August, aud U1ose on the deep water or· sontlwru bedH somewhat later. I regret that it was impo8sihle for me to more thoroughly study the effects of the change of temperature, as I think tue failure or 8uccess of the spattiug, other tbiug1S heiug equal, will be found to depernl maiul.Y upon the temperature to which the mature oy1Ster and embr,Yos are exposed during the S}Jawniug season.
INVE:>'l'IHATlON OF THE CHANGES IN DENSITY OF THE WATER.

In order to haw, definite information as to the change of density of the water surrounding the o;p·ter,., and regarding such changes dm ing the spattmg season as of most importance, and as the maximum change would he most likely to occur ahout the time of the spring title8, I determined to obtain Hpecimens of water 011 a certain nu111her of seetious across each Sound at hig·h and low water of thP spring tides. The 11ections were located a11 follows, and are shown on the sketches accompan,ying this report: Section No. 1 was just abovt' Hooper's Strait and at the mouths of the Nanticoke and Wicomico lti\'ers 1 in ortler that the influence of hoth the strait arnl rivers might be shown. Section No. 2, f<ir the same reason, was north of Kedge's Strait anll across the mouths of the l\Ianokiu aud Big Anneme8sex Rfrer,;. Secrion Ko. 3 was across the eutrance ot' both Souuds, south of Watts' Island. Section No. 4 wa8 a~ross the mi<l<lle of Pocomoke Sound, that the influence of Guilford and Mesongo Creeks might he known. , Section No. 5 was a hove the natural beds of Pocomoke Sound and across the mouth of Pocomoke Hfrer. Stations were selected on theHe isections in such a manner as to obtain specimens of the watl'r that passt·d ornr the beds, aud the specimeus were taken uy means of the drop-water cslinders at every two fathoms of depth. As soon as possible after securing them they were tested with the hydrometer. The results are tabnlate!l in the "recortl of dl'n.sities," and curves showing the various changes accompany this report. All densities are reduced to a standard temperature of 600 Fa.hr., and 1,000 represents the density of distilled water.

In studying these curYes, it must be remembered that only their Yariatiom; are of particular importance. The absolute densit~- is not tso much so: except for comparison with that of other localitiets; but, the variations are importaut if by them we cau account for the failure either of the propagation or attachmt·ut of the youug o~·sters. The curYes will show certain irrq;:·ulnritie.,;, d1ie to either the variations in depth, or to the tides hn Ying chauged from tlood to ebb, or the reYerse, on oue. sicle of the Sound at a time dift'Pring from that on the other. As will be seen, howen:>r, the greatest ntriations in each mouth are in Tangier Sound, on the eastern si1le, where the influence of the ri rnrs is ti-It to great.est 1·xtent. ln Pocomnke ::3nnml the gTeatest nuiations appear to be ou the western tsidP, and I ai-;sign as a reasnu for this that the influence of' Guilford and l\Iesongo Creeks is of small importance compare(l with that of the Pocomoke Rh·er, the current from which sweeps along; the 11ortl1eru aml western parts of the Sound. The cnrn·s sl1ow that the Yariation is ,·ery ;;light, except on the t:;eptemher <sectio11s. The tsecoml series of curve8, tho8e showing the mo11thl~· change of mean densities, indicate that the maximum change on each section was ahont the 1st of Scpte111lwr; that the variatiom; in Po(·ornoke Sound were much greater than in Ta11gier Sou11d; and that the maximum change8 were at tlrn head of Pach Sound, and the variations 1limi11ished toward;; the entrances. The third series of curves !'!hows the same wht>n all the ollservatious in each Sound are assembled, but with this 1lifference-whilt' th<~ density in Tangier Sound was greater on Octoher 1st than at any other till1e, in Pocomoke Sound the iutluence of the 1frer was still felt; awl uotwitllstau<ling the di111inisl1ed temperature the density 011 tl1P 1st of OctohPr was lPss than ou the 1st of .Angnst. Tue fourth series of curves shows the difterence in deusit.r bt:>tween the upper and lower sections in Tangier and Pocomoke Sounds in each mouth, aud indicates that the deusit~· of the water is considerabl.r greater over the lower beds than 011 tlie upper. The maximum density found during the summer was on section 3, ill October, arnl was 1 OlnG. The miuimu111 deusits was found in section 5, iu September, al)(l was 1.000:1. By referring to the curves showiug mouth ls changes of mean densities, it will be seen th»t in only one ca>:e, that of section 5, does tlie density llecome less than 1.0100, aud that en·n on this section it is eYi<le11t tllat this was 11ot the norma.l eo111lition of the water. There were lle:w_y freshets in tlte Pocomoke J{frer during the latter part of .August a111l dnring Sept{'mher, which accon11ts for the slight llensity as shown by tht> CUITes. l\fr. Barroll waH iuformP<l by the i11habita11t:-< of the vicinity of the month of Pocomoke Hiver that these freslwts had ldlkd larg·l' nnm hers of oysters, both ou the natural aud pla1Jt1·d beds. Au i11Rpt'ctio11 of the other c1u·n's show~ tlmt the rnriatiou of density 011 successive tides was uot much greater 011 this section tlrnu 011 tl1e otliers, and as the oysters elsewhere iu tlle Sounds clid not appear to suffer from the effects of these rnriations, I am of the opi11ion that the fluctuation was not sufficient to affect the mature animal, bnt that iu this case the water continued fresh, or practically so, for too long a periml, tlrns killmg the o_ysters h~· endosmose. From tbe observations of densit_y, then, it may be assnnwd that the dP11~it~· of the water, in these localities at least, cannot fall below 1.01 for an,y protracted period without destroyi11g the oysterl!. \Vlwther the changes in deu8it~· affect the spatting can onl~· be aseertained by eontinning the observations for a number of ~easous, or by direct experiment witl1 tht· ;.;pat artifieially raised.
INCIDENTAL INFOR:l>IATION.

During the summer I have examined, under the microscope, 37 4 oysters, of which 212 were femalee and 1G2 males, or t.he percentage of females was 0.5u. 'l'he o.rnters were not all examined at the same time, nor were they all from the same bed, hut the perct:>ntage in each of the lots examined, tweh·e in number, dot's not vary great!,\ from the iwrceutage given abo\·e. I am of the opinion, tl1erefore, that about 60 per cent. of the oy1;ters in a commuuit.v are females. A larger number of obsen·atious is, however, desirable. In making these examinations I have never seen both ova and Rpermatozoa in tlrn same animal, though I ham made mauy careful observations in order to (letect t.he presence of eitller. I ha\'e alJSo carefully examined the gills and mantles of a large number, and have uernr found an embryo oyster within the shell; and as these observations were made during the spawning season, I do

not think it po;;sible that the spat, if they are at any time contained within the gills or mantle, could have escaped my notice. The ohsernttions as to the sex of the oy;iter were continued late in the season, and though the ova and spermatozoa i11 a llU111ber of o;vsters were in apparently good condition as late as the 1st of Octouer, ~vet those products of generation appeared in best condition in the largest number of animals during July, a11d a collsiderable disintegration of the eggs wa;i noticed by the end of that mouth. As fat as I could ascertain, the condition of both ova and spermatozoa depended upon the depth of water, though the rule was not invariable. The generative products of the deep-water o;-;sters reached a state most fayorable for reproduetion several weeks after the same had occurred in the shoal water; and, in general terms, ueitlter ova nor spermatozoa in most of tlte oyst,ers, in either deep or shoal water, after the middle of August, was in a state favoraule for fertilization. Large numbers of oysters iu all depths passed through the spawning season without expelling the contents of the generative organs. I found tltis the case espeeially on the beds on the western si ..le of Tangier Sotwd, aborn Ke<lge';i Strait, where, on the 8th and 9th of October, we found many oysters fattening with tlie generative matter unexpelled. I was informed that this was not unusual, and that it injured the oyster for marketable irnrposes. As late as the 8th I found oysters witll the generative matter in good condition, and on the 7th of October I succeeded in securing from oysters taken from Kedge's Strait a sufficient amount of ova and spermatozoa to make experiments in artifieial impregnation, and was successful in producing one embryo oyster. Probably bad I used greater care a larger number would ha\'e resulted. During the sp,a;ion of 1878 we observed large numbers of astyris in the shells of the mature oysttlrs and atttwhed to those of the young. In many cases they were found in the holes which had been bored in the 8ltells of the latter. As we could not find any known enemy of the oyster in sufficient uumuers to account for the eddent damage done, and as so many circumstances pointed to ctJ5fyris as the cause, I concluded that the boring must he done by that animal, and alluded to it in m,y prc\'ious report. The specimens preser\'ed were described by J\ir. W. H. Dall, and the description appended to that report. During the past summer we hiwe found a much larger number of the rough welks (urosalpinx cinereus) than during tlie previons season, and though the~' were uot found in as large numbers as the astyris, yet their presence inclined ml:'. to question the conclusions arrived at during the season of 1878. I accordingly collected a large numb ... r of astyris and placed them in an aquarium jar with a number of young oysters, changing the water noustantly and inspecting the animals frequently. The observations were continued for over a week, aml at tlte end of that time both oysters and astyris were alive, but there was no evidence of a11y boring, uor did any inspection show an inclination in that direction upon the part of the ast.11ris; on the contrary, they soon left the shells aud went to the bottom of the jar. I then collected a number of urosalpinx cinere1&.~ and subjected them to the same test. At the end of four da.ys one oyster had been bored and one welk was found at work on the shell of another. The rough welk is known to do great injury to the oyster in Long Island Sound, and the destruc· tion of the yout!g, ttlluded to ill' my previous report as due to the drills, may be effected hy this animal. That large numbers are destroyed by the welks cannot be doubted; but as it is possible that the ltstyris may also assist in this destruction, a more extended investigation of this question than I was enabled to make is desirable. An analysis of several specimens of the water of the Sound and bay, by Prof. C. E. Monroe, of the Naval Academy, is appended to this report for use in comparing the localities innstigated with others whose iIH'estigation may be subsequently attempted. The specimens have bet' n selected from those taken on different stages of the tide and from different sections. The only noticeahle change on the beds this season was that the amount of red sponge appeared to be much lt:>ss than in 1878. In other respects they are, to outward appearances, in a similar state, though the dredgers report them as much broken up and with au increased amount of debr,is.
INFORMATION OBTAINED FIWM "RECORD OF STATISTICS."

The member of the party ot1 duty at Crisfield inspected, during the season, 496 vessels directly engaged in the oyster fi,.;hery, and the results of these inspections have been recorded in the record of statistics, which record, to a great extent, explains itself.

Owing to the large number..of vessels dredging, it was frequently impossible to \'isit and inspeet all that entered during the day. 'When such was the case, those inspected were selected from different classes and from different dredging ~rounds that a fair idea might be obtained of the rrnmber of oysters removed each day from each bed. The method of examination was as follows: The total number of bushels in the load giveu by the master of the vessel was recorded, w.ith the number of hours of labor necessary to obtain that quantity, and other matters of statistical interest. Several samples of one-(1narter or one-half bushel each were tlten selected froru different parts of the load and the number of oysters of each class iu each sample counted and recorded. The number of samples examined depended upon tlte nnm her of hushels i11 the load and upon foe character of the oysters, a large number being taken when the oysters appeared dissimilar, arnl when the quantity was great. At least three samples were usually examined. In most cases the average number of each class per sample was nearly the same a1:1 that given by each examination, and, conseqnentl,Y, it is assumed that a close estimate of the number of each class iu the entire load was obtained by multiplying the number of each elass ill a bushel, as shown b,y the samples, by the total number of bushels in the load. From the record of these inspections I have been able to determine with practical accuracy the number of oysters of' the several classes removed front the various beds b.v each deRcriptiou of dredging vessel. After Septemher 1, when the dredging begau, we counted each UU,\' all the ,-essels in sight from the '' Palinurus," specifying the size and the gronn'l upon which they were working, and tlw 11mster1:1 of the dredging vessels were also requested to note the 1mrnber of dredgers working i11 their Yicinity, which they in mauy cases Yery obligingly did. .As eYen with these data, the number of working days given on each bed is very small, and because no bed is dredged continuously during the season, but at interrnls, I have divided the sections in a similar manner to that described in my previous report. 'rhe first section includes the Led,; uorth of Piney Island Bar and the }luscle Hole; the secotHl SPctiou, those from the Mnscle Hofo and Piney Island Bar to the Great Rock; the third section, tlw remuiniug beds iu Ta11gier t\onnd; and the fourth section, all the Jlocomoke beds. By thrn arrangement duplication of the vessels couuted is prenmted and the average number of vessels working eact1 day is more nea,rly a correct estimate. The ,-essels dredging on these seYeral sections, as counted by ourselves a1Hl by their masters, have been assembled; the number of oysters assigned to each class of vessel working iu the ::;ecti011 has then been multiplied by the uurnber of vessels of each class, and tlw total number of oysters taken oft' the beds in each section thus obtained. The number of oysters taken by any yessel iu a day ntries greatI.r, owing to the weather principall,y, but in assigning the quantity on each day, the number brought in by vessels of the same class, as shown by "record of statistics," has been used, m,; a more correct estimate is thus assured than would be givcu hy usiug the average for the whole season. The following table has been compiled from the calenlatious, aud shows the number of o~sters taken from each section in a specified number of days; supposing the observations to ha,\'e extended over a sufficient period, the number of oysters has been di\'ided b~' the number of days, and the average numbrn· removed in each day thns obtained.

It will l.Je uoticml tlrnt the uuml.Jer of uredging vesselH increases on each succeeding section iu Tangier Sound, l.Jut that the munl.Jer taken by each sail, and the yield per day, decrease. Also, that the number of Hail iu l'oeomoke Sou ml is much sma.ller than in any other section, an<l that the yield per da~· is also much smaller. The character of the bottom and the depth of the water materially influence the yield of the heds, those iu shoal water with soft bottoms allowing more frequent hauls of the 4lredges than those in deep water ot on hard bottoms. lint as the dredges used iu deep water and on hard bottoms an~ usuall~· much l1eavier, this inequality is overcome to some extent. Again, tlle large vessels take a greater proportion of the o.rsters than the small ones, aud those huge vessels usuall.v work on the deep-water beds. Considering the difforent sizes of the vessels an~ the superiority of the crews of the larger ones, and the heavier dredges used by them, I am of the opinion that the disparit;\· between t.he yields of the Upper and Lower Tangier Beds is greater than it should bt·. The beds of the Middle Section are, with the exception of Piney Island Bar, similar to those of tl1e upper section; yet, with a larger number of vessels working, the ~-ield of that section is less than the upper. These facts, I think, show that the bed8 1n Lower Ta.ngier Sound are Jess productfre than those in the upper. The dredging in Pocomoke Sound waH principally on the upper beds, and none was done as far as we could ascertain on either the Brig or Parker's Beds. As the middle and upper beds in this Sound are very similar iu character of bottom and depth of water to the middle and upper beds in Tangier Sound, it would be inferred that the yield per day in l)ocomoke would b 1 about the same. On the contrary, as shown by the table, it is absurdly small; and, considering its size, it is not astonislling that the beds have been to a great extent abandoned. Taking the munber of ossters removed each day, and considering, for the reasons given in my previous report, the working season to be of 120 days, I have compiled the following table, in which is given tl1e number of oysters removed from eacll section and from the Sounds in one day and in the sea.son. I have also given the same estimatt·d in 1878 for comparison.

Two hundrerl osRWrs are allowf'd to a

The estimated number of young rem<ffe<l from all seetiom; in OJW cla,,·, in 11'71', was about 1 ,240,000, or 148,800,000 in the course of the "easou. It will be seen hy t11e table that about one hn111lred million more oysters were remon~cl in 1871'

than would be in 1879, and that about the same <>xce8s existR with regarrl to the young-. Of tlw two estimates, that of 1879 is much more accurate, beiug· based upon a larger unmber of observations, more carefolly and systematically made than was possible in 18 ::;;, but t.he disparity between the two is so great that the estimate of 1878 would appear \7 aluelPHs, conltl not some cause bP assl'gned for a decrease in the numher of o~'St{~rs taken from thP lwtls. 'l'his dpcrease. as may be easily seeu, must ht' due to one or both of the following causes: 1st. The fertility of the beds remaining the same, the dretlgers may not be as numerous. 2d. The number of dredgers remaining the same, the be<ls may be exhaustd; or, becoming so, there would be a smaller number of oysters produced; or, 3d. The nnmher of tlretlgers may have decreased and the fertility of thP lrnds may be great.J~ impaire<l. There are 110 statistics of the oyster fishery in the localities under consideration except those collected by m~·self, and f am consequently obliged to put a greater depeudencc upon them tha11 they intrinsically ml'rit. They are necessarily so mew hat rude, but., in the abse11ce of other iuformation, they can be used as giYing soniP indication nf the prnbal)lf' progres>i of the fi.,hery in the two seasons under consideration. Byexamiuing my preYious report it will he see11 tl1at in thitt.eeu day" we counted l,fi!-)5 vessels working on the various beds in both Sou11ds. From mu records of the past season I find that the number observed by all persons was, in thirty-seYeu 1lays, 2,275, or in 1878 the a''erage number working on each day was 1~2, while in 1879 it wa8 61, or one-half as mauy. Therefore, the sma.11 yield of the beds during the autnmn months of 187!l, allll the small estimate of the yield for the year, may be accounted for by tlrn smaller number of vessels at work, and as in round numbers the number of oysters estimated as taken in 1879 was about one-half that in 1878. I think that tlw prt>,ious estimate may he accepted as practically correct. My last ad vices from Crisfield inform me that there is but rnr.v little dredging goiug on in the Sounds, most of the vessels working in the bay and in the Potomac Uiver. Tue principal cam·<.> assignt>.Al for this is the presence of you.ng growth on the bed8, by which is meant immaturt> oysters under two years of age. The presence of this class in large nnmbers prevents th(' O.YRt.ers from fattening rapidly. Another reason given is that the beds are much broken up, a11d that tile returns are very poor for the usual amount of labor.
CONCLUSIONS.

My additional experience iu the investigation and the information collected dming the pa:.~t season has proved that a few of the conclusions at which I arrived in 1878, aud which are contained iu my report of the operations of that season, are erroneous. Some of them lrn,ve heen alreadr alluded to, and the allusions to the remaining ones here find their most appropl'iate place. . I find my supposition that there is a general attachment of spat on all the beds in any season, to be, to a certain extent, incorrect. The spatting may be general, and a majority of the

340

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

oysters may spawn each year, hut the attachment of the young is a very difft·reut thing, aud as the most precarious period in the lifo of the oyster is that just anterior to its attachment, a series of causes detrimental to tlie life of the embryo, while it is in its free swimming state, may readily occur, and thus pre,·ent such attachment. My investigation of the past season hm.; proved conclusively that the class of oysters termed ''young growth" in my previous report were not of the brood of 1878 but of 1877 01"1876. The character of the young found in both seasons, tlu· determination of the time of earliest attachment, and the growtl1 and appearance of the oysterR 011 the tiles, han' led me to this conclusion. As thr: young do not attach before the milJ.dle of Augm;t, they could hardly reach such a size and shape by October as would prevent their recognition as of the same season's growth. From the inspection of tlie o~'stens taken during- the laist season, many being fou11d with the generati,·e matter unexpeJled, I am of the opinion that a combination of natnral causes may preYent the expulsion of both the male and female cells, and theri> '\\ould consequently be no impregnation during that season. As I mentioned in the report of 1878, many persons of experience are of that opinion, and I now concur with them in thinking that uot only the attachment of young may not he general nor occur each year, but that the emission of the products of generation may also be frequently confined to partial areas, ancl that by a combinatio11 of circumstances there can be a total failure of impregnation on all beds of auy locality. I also find by additional experience, that the young oyster is not fit for marketable pnrposei'i nntil at least a year and a half or two years old, awl cousequently the total number of young removed, as estimated in my previous report, would be a total sacrifice, and, as will be seen by the table showing the number of oysters removed, this sacrifice probably amounted in 1878 t,o 148,800,000 oysters. By refereuce to the tables showing the success or failure of the several spatting seasons, it will be seen that there is little or no regularity of either success or failure, but, as we have only hecu able to investigate the spatting of three seasons, it ma,y be found by snbseque11t observations that two similar seasons of success, moderate success, or failure, will follow each other; but so far this bas not been the case arnl in the period of three years we have, comparativel.v to the other seasons. one at least of snccessfnl attachmeut. I can see po reason for supposing that there is any regular recurrence of the spatting seasons, and am inclined to believe that the success or failure is due to two causes: variations of temperature and variations of density; but I bad no means of ascer, taining the changes either of temperature or density in the years preceding those in which I have heen engaged upon this investigation, wd in both seasons I arrived in the Sounds too late for tlw temperatures or determinat,ions of·density obtained hy the part,y to be, with reference to the spatting, of practical Yalue. 0;5sters will and do live in very dissimilar temperatures and in waters of very different densities, as is shown by their existence in the waters of North America from Nova Scotia to the Gulf, and on both Atlantic and Pacific coasts. That the mature oyster is a hardy animal, readily adapt· ing itself to new conditions and environment, is shown by the ease with which it i8 transplanted from the warm waters of the Chesapeake to the colder ones of New England; from the dense and salt waters of tlie ocean and bay to the brackish waters of the creeks and rivers or vice versa, and from soft bottoms to hard or the reverse; hut, naturally, this hardiness is not a quality of the immature oysters or the swimming embryos. The influence of increased or <liminished temperature upon the formation of the oYa and spermatozoa must be verJ serious, and, judging by analogy, it would seem probable that the formation would be more rapid during a warm spring than during a cold ofie. Whether the fo1 mation bas been late or early when once formed, a sudden change of density or of temperature ma.y so affect the oyster or the generative matter that the latter would not he expelled. Only upon this hypothesi!~ can be explained the retention of the products of generation noticed in so many oysters, and whicl1 is said to be so common, for none of the other conditions are subject to violent changes, such being peculiar to the density and temperature alone. Professor Brooks states that he found both ova and spermatozoa ripe and fit for fertilization about the middle of May, and a.s the oysters were taken from shoal water, probably one fathom deep, the shoal-water oysters were probably spawning throughout June. Both Professor B~ks and myself found the ripeness of' the oysters to depend upon the depth of water from wbicl1 they

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

341

were taken, and this is without doubt caused by the ·difforeuce of temperature. Professor Brooks also states that there was a great deal of cold, rainy weather during June, and two hail storm:;.. The rainy weather would affect the density of the water by increasing the rnlumes of the various creeks and r_ivers, and the changes of density would probably affect the production and emhision of the generative matter. It is an interesting coincidence at least, that the oysters found to be fattening wit11 the products of generation unexpelled were either from beds m comparatively shoal water, or from the shoal parts of deep.water beds, and that those oysters shoulcl have been ripe and spawniii'g during the month of .Tune. Again, it may be that the lowness of the temperature prevented the deep-water oysters from ripening as soon as usual, and the mildness of the succeeding autumn may have pre,,ented the destruction of the 01'a and spermatozoa, thus rendering possible the fertilization achieYed hy me in Octoht'l'. as the oy:;.ters from which l procured the oya and spermatozoa were taken from deep watBr. Probably the influence of ehanges of enYironment, especial!J· of density aud temperature of the water, is most severely felt by the embryo whe.n in their free swimming state, and, in connection with the want of success of the spatting Reason in the Sounds, it is noticed that the temperature curves show a maximum change about the time when it is 8Upposed that the young would attach in largest numbers, or when they were swimming al>out in the water. It is also worthy of notice that Professor Brooks, about this time, met with _the minimum amouut of success in bis efi>rts to artificially raise the embryo. In consideration of the foregoing, J am of the opinion that the success or failure of any spatting 8eason is dependent upon the equability of the temperature; that the higher the temperatun· during the spring months the earlier will lw the advent of the spawning season, and that an increased temperature will a.Jso liasten the development of the spat, and of the J·oung oysters after they have become attached. I also infer that sudden and extensive changes of density will likewise affect tlie advent, dnra.tion, and success of the spawning: though to a less extent. Subsequent to the attachment of the animal, changes of the conditions surrounding it are not of so mnel1 importance, though naturally such changes will more severely affect tlle delicate organism of the young oyster than that of the older and mort~ hardened adult. During the fin·t six monthis of its existe11ce the oy8ter is expoised to tile greatest danger from the numerous enemies which surround it. The thiu, delicate shells~ from one-sixteenth of an incl1 to one inch in diameter, are readily bornd by tbe drills or t-0rn off hy the crabs, and the immense number of both leayes no room to doubt their destrncti1·e effects. As an instance, the inspection of the spat collect-0rs in the Rig Aunernessex l{iyer shows that during the early months of their existence about 50 per cent. of the young oysters were destroyed. Naturally, as the animal progresses, it becomes more hardy and better able to resist the attacks of enemies and changes of environment, and thus we find on the unworked beds, where the oysters are practically in a natural state, that the decrease in passing from young growth t-0 mature oysters is about 30 per cent., or about one-thir<l of a gi\'en numher perish in passing from tlw first. to the fourth year of their existence. Here our information ceases, but euoug·h has beeu gathered to indicate the ratio which natnn' has assigned as necessary between the young and the mature oysters. For e\'ery 1,000 of tlle latter there should be 1,500 of the former, if the number of brood oysters necessary to maintain the fecundity of the beds is t.o be kept up, and though this ratio is based upon data which are not quit<' sufficient, yet, as I have said, it is all that has been afforded as yet, and may be accepted withi11 certain limits. Certainly, whatever it shoultl be, the number of the rising generation of the animals should never be less than that of the older, or there should alwa,ys he as many young as mature on any bed, and a greatly increased ratio of .roung to mature o.rsters would sliow either one of two things-either the mortality in passing from youth to mat,urity was much greater tha11 shown by the dredging results in the bay, or that a very large nnmher of mature oysters had bee11 removed by other than natural causes. In considering these several beds the question of food and other necessar.r supplies lias uot been considered, as it is evident that wliere an oyster bed is formed and exists naturally, all the conditions for its successful life are probably present, and any failure of an important supply would be followed by a speedy extinction of a11 the oyst.ers on the bed. Such determinations of tlu~ quality

and quantity of the food, character of lmttofn aml water, and other matters, are only of interest and desirable for the purpose of comparing one locality with another. Such was not the purpost' of this invesitigation, and consequentl~--the. fleterminatiou of those points has been but incidental to the work. Probably the fecundity of a bed ii-; increased, to a certain exteut, by workiug· upon it. Tlw dredges or other implements nsetl opcu the bed arnl spread it, thus giving more room for develop· ment, and allowing a greater amount of food to reach the animals, aml as the mortality is great in all thickly-populated tracts and in any closely-united commnnit~-, it is evident that no removal of brood oystern could be effected without destroying t.Iw fecundity of the bed, did not this ver~· removal inflneuce the mortality among· the yonng so as to allo\Y a larger number t-0 come to maturity. But tl1e rernoYal of brood oystt>rs may become so great that the most violent exertions of nature to supply others arP un~qual to the demand, and it must be e\'ident that as soon as the number of brood oysters is thus diminished, the fecundity of the hell is impaired. This impairment constant!.\- iucreai;es, int!uencing, as it does, hoth old and young. As t,he number of the latter decreas!', so will the number of the fonner, and as that number is again and again <}iminished, the number of youug produced hy them must co11stantly diminisl1. Thus the cause for the destruction of the foc11adity of the be(l all(l the grndual extinction of the animal;; upon it can be readily urnlcrstood a1Hl as easily comprehemled as the fact that the fecundity or productive power of a be(l tkpcnds upon the nnm her of mature i4paw11-beariug o~·sters upon it. lt is not meant by this that none but the matul'e o~·steri-; ar\· capable of reproduction, as such is not the case, oysters of emu six or nine m1mths~ growth ha,·ing heen obsen·ed by me with ripe ova and spermatozoa iu them, but the mai11 dependence 1111u;t be placed 11pon the adults in the community, as the spawn of tlw yo11ng growth is not eo11si(forahle when compared with that of the ot11er class. \Vithont a k1wwledg·e of the 1m1111Jer of oysters 011 a hed it is impossible to say what number shoultl be removed, a111l a1-1 au attainment of the knowledge of tl1e llllrn':wr on the bed is almost impossible, all that can he dom' j,; to keep tlLe ratios lwtwe1·11 th(' ,vonng aml U1e mat1ue as uearl,Y the same as on the natnrnl lwd.s: ti tis should he the aim a.nd re1mlt of all laws having the protection of the beds in view. Referring to that portion of this re1lort relating· to the focuudity of the beds in the Sounds, it is seen that in some cases the ratio of .voung to mature oysters is greater, and in ot.her cases less, than it shonhl he, and that in a few cases the ratio seems to be within the prescribed limits. Ao; has been shown, the decreased ratios must be the result of a w;~nt of reproduction, while the increase may be due to the removal of the matLire oysters. If we take the total number of the oysters examined in the Sounds we will have a ratio expressiug the general fecundity of tile beds, and this ratio between 70,866 mature oysters and 36,824 young ones is O.u. Assembling all the oysters counted on the beds in the bay we would have as a ratio 1.5. Practically, none of the nmture oysters had been removed from the beds in the bay, while large numbers had hcen taken from those in the Sounds. Tl1e estimates for eaeh show, approximately, how many ham been taken, and if by examination we find that the number of young oysters takeu off the beds in the ~ounds greatl~- exceeds the number of mature removed, it may be assumed that the restoration of both classes to the beds would be immediately shown by a change in the ratio of .roung growth to mature oysters. By the estimate of 1878 we find that 184,600,000 mature aud 148,800,000 young were removed, but ns the number of youug removed would be less and less during the season on account of the mortality among them, and as we have found that mortality t-0 be about 50 per cent., I will consider that the removal of the young during the season of 1878 and 1879 probably did not exceed 7414-00,000. Therefore the total number removed was 25!!,000,000, of which 71 per cent. were mature, spawn-bearing oysters, and as 65 per cent. of the oysters at present on the beds are mature, the add it.ion of the 260,000,000 removed would raise this percentage to 68, which would make the ratio of young to old even smaller. Consequently the small percentage of youug is not due t-0 the removal of that class during the previous season. The two beds of wbicl1 we have the most exact and complete statistiool records in this season

From Table II, dredging results in the Sound:;, l find the j,ercentage of mature oJ·st(>rs to the total number on the two beds mentioned is on the Great Rock U, and on the vVoman's Marsh 3(). Hence, if there had been no fishing, we would ha,·e on the Great Rock 44 per cent. of the oysters mature and full grown, and on the Woman's l\Iarsh 52 per cent. mature. ·"ve find hy making a similar calculation for Piney Island Bar tliat the }lercentage of mature oysters remoYed is 70, and that by the dredging results :W per cent. of those on the bed were mature; hence, 45 per cent. would represent the percentage on l'i11ey Island Bar hatl there Lee11 no fishing. The ratio~ on these beds would then, were the oysteroi removed still present, lie 1.2 on thP GrPat Roek, O.!) 011 the oman's "Marsh, and l.:? on Pine.'· Island Bai" lt will be seen hy the above that there has beeu a se,·ere fishing of rnau,\· of the be<ls in the Sounds during the last four or fh-e years-that is, exhansti,,e of mature hrood oysters-and that consequently the large ratioi,; of youug to mature oysters is not the re1rnlr of a JargP attachment of young, but rather of the removal or the older oystt·rs, a111l he11ce the chauge from a large ratio t-0 a very small one, or riee rersa, may be regarded as a safe indication of the deterioration of the bed; for, as explained in the preYious part of this report, the ratio will remain abnormally large until the young growth reach maturity, when it will become ahnorrnally small, and will so remain for a few years, when it will again become very large, and this process will contiune for some time until the beds are practically unfit for dredging, as is the case iu Pocomoke Sound. Thus not even the ratios are sure indicatiom; of the increase or decreai,;e in the muHher of oyster,;, hut they must be considered together with other facts before we can arrive at ,inst conclusions. By reference to the closing paragraphs of that part of the report relating to the fecundity of the beds, it will be noticed that the amoaut of debris increases on the sontl1ern 'l'angier beds, aml that on most of the beds of the Sonnds it is much greater than it was iu the ba,\·. An increase of the percentage of debris, as already pointed out, is an indicatiou of the deterioration of the bed, and is due to the destructive effects of the dredging, which not ouly removes many oysters, but so disturbs many others .that their destruction is an almost assured fact. 'ro a certain extent this is a necessary incident of the fishers, aml cannot be helped; but overworking the beds increases this evil as well as others, as is evident by the percentage on many of the Pocomoke beds. Referring to the table showing the number of o;ysters removed in 18i8, and comparing it with the table of number of oysters to the square J·ard, the following may be noticed: 1st. In the upper pai;t of Tangier Sound the numbers to the square yard are very large, which is probably due to the shoalness of' the water and the soft bottom, which allowed a larger number of oysters to be taken. In addition, the mature oysters are smaller than on the southern beds, as shown in Table I, dredging results; thus a greater number would be taken in the dredge, and the number to the square yard increased. 2d. Though the numbers to the square yard are very large, yet there is a serious <lecrease from that established in 1878. By reference to the ''Table showing number of oysters removed," I find that the largest number of oysters were removed from this section in both seasons, and, supposing the number of dredging vessels to have been constant, instead of diminishing one-half, the number of oysters removed in 1879 would be greater by 14,000,000 than the number removed in 1878, or, in other words, the fishing is prop-0rtionally increasing. As this fishing is confined principally to the

"T

344

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

mature oysters, it can lJe readily understood why the unmher of these o:n1ter1:1 to the square yard should be mucl1 decrease,1. In the second section we find the uumuers to be nearly the same as those outsiue; that there i8 a gain in the ri>ers where there i8 the minimum amount of dredging, a11d also ou two beds which were worked Yer.r little in 1878-'79, on account of the young growth which had attached to them. '£he proportional increase of dredging, as shown b;r tbe numberR remon~d in each season, and supposing the number of dredgi11g vessels to ha\'e beeu the sanw, wonld be, 011 th i.~ section, 11 1000,000; these were taken 1wincipa.lly from the western beds a11d Piney Island Bar, awl 011 tho;;e beds tbere is a uitninished uumber to the square yard. Again, we find by reference to the tallies, that on the southern belli\ iu Tangier Sound the uumber to the square yard is mucl1 smaller tllau on the bedH in the bay. This is due probably to two causes-the conditio11 of the lied, or the depth of the water, hanlness of bottom aml size of the oysters, and to the reuHffal of too large a nuuiber of mature o_ysters duriug preYiou:s years· As I have pointed out, when· th(· uumber 011 a worked bed falls much helow that on au unworked one, it must, other thiugs beiug equal, be accepted as an indication of a decrease in the producch-it~- of the bed. That much is assured; but ou this section there appears to be au increase in tbe unmber of oyst,~r.s to the square ~-:ml oyer the nmn her found i11 J 878, and that increaHe must be aecounted for in some way. The table showing the uumhel' of oyster,.; re1110Yed proves the u11111ber taken from this section to be a constantly decrea;;in~· one, for in 1878 there were takeu b~· twice aH many ,-eRsels four times a,; mauy oysters as were renHffed in 187!J. This may be tluc to t1Yo canseH, and probably is due, to some extent, to both. 'l'he pro,luctfrity of the heds may be irupaire,l, or tbe fishery may be lesis earnest and exhaustive than in the past. \Ve can oul.r account for the increased number to the square yard b.r :issuming th« latter to he the caRe, t.he hed8 haYing probably enforced a resting period by the material failure. of the uyc;ters. '.rhe numbers to the s'1uare ;vard and yield iu Pocomoke Somal need 110 commtmt. X ot 011ly are the numbers below the standard aud decreasing, !Jut the ;yield is also decreasing, as it. naturally would under such (\ireumstances. Naturally, as soon as any bell ceases to gi,·e au adequate returu for the labor expended npo11 it, the dredging rn:,;sels will snek other illld more profitable fields for exertion, and the desertion of any bed ma.r lie aceeptcd as au indication of it:,; decreased producth'e power. As has been mentioned under the head of statistirntl information, <hedging vessel.s have, to a great extent, left the ~ounds for the waters of the bay and Potomac River. .,. Considering the abnormal ratios between the mature and young oysters, the iucrea:,;ed percentage of deln·is on the beds, the smallness of the number to the sqnare yanl, and the decrease of those numbers ou most of the beds, together with the large number of oysters, young and old, annually removed, I am of the opinion that though the fecnudity of the beds in Tangier Sound is uot yet destroyed, it i,.; very much impaired, and that not only are the beds rapidly and surely de.terioratiug from the excessirn fishery, bnt th:tt thelr total failure, like unto that iu Pocomoke Sound, is but a question of time. So far as it is possible to make any more exaiet prediction than the above, l am of the opinion that, the fishery still continuing, thiL failure will occur first on the beds at the entrances of the Sonnd or those in sections 1 and a, arnl of the two the failnrn of the lower beds is most likely to fir11t occur, awl of all the beds the Woman's Mar.sh will be the first to give out. At1 stated at the beginning of this report, the beds may be protected either indirectly by enlargi ug the areas for the dredgers or insuring by artificial means the maturity of a larger number of 8pat; or directly, by limiting and restricting the fishery. I alluded in my previous report to the manner iu which this latter form of protection wag afforded abroad, and suggested a manner for afforcting it at home. The necessit~- for the adoption of some such measures seems so urgent that I earnestly hop1~ they will shortly be undertake11. · The ext0i11sion of the dredging ground can be easil;y a ttaiue1l b,r depositing the shells from the ,.;bell heaps about the packing houses 011 tlle lmtto1111; co11tiguous to the natural beds; hut such deposit should always be made in the direction of the ebb nnd flow of the tide, in order that the drifting spat may be carrie<l over the newly-ex-pQ8ed cnltch. The bottom is of minor importance

so long a,i;; it is of sufficient consi8tt~1iey to pre\·ent the oysters from sinking into the mud. A sticky clay bottom is preferable, though the beds may be extended oYer sand 11hm1ls. Jn searching for new beds they will probably be found about the mouths of estuaries and riYers, and where t.liere are suddPn chauges of bottom. In the Chesapeake, depths of from two to four fathoms will he most likely to reward a search, and wl1ere there are largp beds iu the creeks and riYers it is like!~' that there has been a natural expans1011 through their mouths, aud beds will probably be found off of them. The search must be carefully conducted, or the beds, which appear to be long, narrow ridges, will be mii;se<l. The dredge should lJ~ drag·ged across the tide, as the beds usually extend in the directiou of the current. A sudden change of depth of two or thre.e feet, and from soft to bard hot.tom wlien 011 an orster groulld, is au unfailillg sign of the presence of a patch or hed. Considering the success which has attended the in\·estigation of Professor Brooks, and the new light which it has thrown upon the embryo life of the oyster, I t!Jiuk t!Jat perhaps the most efficacious means of maiutaiuiug the productiYe power of the beds would be in hringiug, if such be possible, the artificial impregnation of the eggs aud subsequent care of the young to such a state of perfection as would be of practical utility. Professor Brooks is, of course, the best person to deYise the method of suecessfully continuing his experiment, awl I hope that he may he able to do so and that he will meet with eom1Jlete success. As pertinent to his work, which is mainly conducted hy means of aquaria, I would suggest that the stud~~ of the effect of changes of tempflrature, so far as the;y affect the embryo, can he best and most easily done while engaged upon tlie attempt to artificially raise them; or, in order to arrirn at certain conclusions with regard to the effect of changes of density or of temperature, the inYestigation, if conduct.el! 011 the natural beds, must be extended onw many seasons iu Q,nler t.o insure, hy a coincidence of temperatures or densities aud results, the elimiimtion of other affecting conditions. The study of the temperature seems so important that an~- suggestion with regard to it is of Yalue and should claim attention. I would also recommend that some person inspect and count, at intervals, the oysters on the spat collector in the Big Annemesscx R·iYcr. It is securely moored and buoyed with a spar buoy, and probably will remain in place. With regard to the direct proteetio11 of the beds in the Sounds, I can onJ)~ renew my prcYious recommendations. The deterioration of au;y bed will he 1wident b;y an abnormal ratio of young growth to mature oysters; by a small and decreasing num her to the S<Juare yard; by large and increasing percentage. of brokeu shells and other debris, and by the appearance of the oysters, as has been descrilwd. When all these indications are present, if the dredging is not totally prohibited it should at least be so limited as to insure the number of young growth remaining at least one third greater than the number of mature, and great changes from this ratio are to be avoided and gmudetl against.

DESCUIPTION OF THE "DRILL" REFERRED TO TN THE REPORT OF THE OPERATIONS DURING! THE SEASON OF 1878.

By W.

H. DALL,

AsoT. C. & G. St:RYEY.

Only a few specimens were preserved, and hence it is impossil.Jle to speak positi,·ely in regard to its distinctness from tlw allied forms ,4.Ytyris spizantlia (Rar.) and A. lunata Dall (Ex. Say). It differs from the former, so far as the s11ecimrns go, in color, pattrrn, and solidity 1 having also more whorls and a more slender form. · It differs in form very much from southern specimens of A. lunata, but more specimens ot' each are needed to determine the limits of variation in these small shells. The;r belong to a group known to be extremely variable. It mar for the present ue denominated by the varietal name Astyrls var. lfinslovii in commemoration of its discoYerer. Tllougb known to be carnivorous, no species of the genus Astyris bas been recorded until now as an injurious animal.

The classification of the dredging vessels is the result of, and dependent upon, actual obser

vations. It was noticed that those vessels usually at work in a particular locality were generally
of a certain rig and tonnage, and where there was a dissimilarity in that respect, we recorded, when in the locality, the proportion of large and small vessels and of different rigs. In compiling the table the dredging vessels have been separate<! into three classes. The first class represents large.and small vessels; the average" take" of this class was 42

bushels per vessel.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

The second class represents small vessels; the average "take'' of this class was 16.G bushels per vessel. In the third class, two-thirds of the vessels were small and one-third large; the average "take" of this class was 2~J hush els to the vessel. By actual count, we found the average number of young to a bushel to be'!02.

The following analysis of the water of the Sounds and Ba,y was made at m;y request by Mr. Charles E. Monroe, Professor of Chemistry at tlie U11iterl States ]fayal Academy. As in all probability the chemical character of the water in the locality under consideration is not subject to fre(1ue11t or .great changes the constituents of the water as determined by Professor Monroe may be accepted as the normal ones. The aualysis furnishes data for comparison, and in transplanting o_ys_ters from this locality it will be of a1h-autage to the o,yster culturist to consult the table and avoid the transference of the oysteri,; to conditiorn; of marked dissimilarity.

ON THE LENGTH OF A NAUTICAL MILE.
BY J. E. HILGA.RD.

The length of a nautical mile is define1l as Urn one-sixtieth part of tliat of a degree of a great circle of the earth. ff the earth were a perfect sphere of known dimensions, the lengths of a nautical mile, according to the abon definition, would be a definite and invariable quantity. Owing, however, to the eartli's compression, aml the consequent difference in the lengths of tlie radii of cnryature at different points of its surface, much diversit.Y has arisen, in usage and in books of reference, in assigning the length of a nautical mile. Thus it i8 variomily given as equal toThe mean leugth of a minute of latitude on the meridian. Tlle length of a minute of the meridian corresponding to the radius of curvature of the particular Iatitnd~'. TlJe length of a rnirrnttJ of longitude on the equator, tlie latter definition being p"ooably due to the common use among mariuers of Mercator's pr<~jection, in which the degrees of the successive parallel" of latitude arc equal to those on the eqnat-0r. In order to remove all uncertainty and to introduce uniformity this office adopted, several years ago, the value which results from considering the nautical mile a:s equa,l to tlie one-sixtieth part of the length of a degree on the great eircle of a sphere whose surface is equal to the BIJ!face of the eartlt. 'l'his rnlue, computed on Clarke's splieroid, is: One nautical mile o ..-48iMte~6080.27 feet, a \'alue which corresponds to the adopted lengtli of the Admiralty knot=6080 foet In the following tables are gh'en the numerical results of the discussion relatin to this subject:

ON A .METHOD OF REAl>JLY TRANSFERRING THE _l'.l\DERGHOUID TERMINAL :\1ARKS OF A BASE LII\E.
By 0. H. 'rIT'I'::YIAKX, A>"l-'i,.,t.ant.

As a base line monument wliose foundation ii': near the surface of tile grnurnl is liable to <listur!Jance by frost, the ultimate 1mint of reference is usna!J.r an UIHlergronml mark. The cm;tomar~ Q-rrangcment of the surface marks, forming a superstructure to the underground mark, makl·s it difficult to refer to the latter. The usual method of referring one to tl1e other is to ex<'.antte trenches in line between the lower marks and a theodolit<> mouutetl at souw distancl' from it, rso that it is Yisible in the telescope of the theodolite, whic11 is adjusted to describe it vertkal plane at right anwes to the line of measurement. When it was desired to place. t.Le permanent marks at the termi11i of the Trial Base at Fort !llyer, Virginia, suggestions as to the best met110d of accomplishing the desired cud were iiffited uy Mr. Hilgard, the assistant in charge of the office, under whose direction the operntions of tile measuring and marking were execnted. The following pl:w, snbmittl'<l by the writer, waio; approve1l and adopted. The essential features of the plan are as follows: A sta hle um]e1"gro1111'1 mark is pl:Jcpd he low the frost line.· On~r tl1is mark is r;et all eartlrn11warn pipl', which l'Xte11ds upwanl:-; iuto aud through a hollow surface pier, from whicli, howm·er, it is entirely disconnected. Tlw foundatiou of the surface pier is separated from the underground mark by a depth of 8e,·eral feet. of earth, hy w!Jieh the earthenware tnbe is held firmly iu vositiou. The tube is protected agaiu8t the weatlJer hy means of a capstone, removable at pleasure. Terrnina 1 snrfaee marks are made on tlrn pier, below the capstone, in the line of the base and at known distances from the vertical plane, passing through the underground mark at right angleH to t!Je line of t!Je has<\. To refer the lower mark to the surface a vertieal collimator is used. Tuis consists of a telescope, having an eye·piece filar micrometer and carrsiug a delicate level, and which re,·olves about a vert.ical axis passing through a small tripod stand furnished with lm·eling screws. The under. ground mark is rendered visible by means of natural or artificial light reflected downwards by a mirror. The line of collimation of the telescope, being placed in the vertical of the undergrouud mark, i;;en·es a.s the initial point in the measurement of the base. Under the direction of .M:r. Hilgard the details of the collimator were arranged by Mr. Saegmuller, chief mechanician. As constructed, it consists of a brass plate about 14 centimeters in diameter, supported on three leveling screws. The upper surface is turned out so as to leaw a rim about 5 millimeters deep and 10 ~illimeters thick, through which four counter screws pass. The counter screws press against the beveled edge of the circular plate which forms the base of a hollow column in which the t.elesoope revolves about its vertical axis. Attached to the telescope is a delicate level with a scale, 1 millimeter of which has an angular value of about 2". The ocular can be adjusted to different foci by the usual rack and pinion movement, and has a filar micrometer. The telescope has a collar, concentric with itB axis, carrying, at opposite ends of that
·At Greenwich the lowest temperature marked by a thermometer 6.4 feet below the surface of the ground is abont 9~ Fa.hr. above the tneu.n temperatnre of the coldest month in the year. If the same difference holds at \Va$h_ i11gt~11, a cor.reapondiug depth would gi Vil a minimum temperature of about 43° Fahr.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

\Yltich is at right angles to the micrometer thread, two polished steel surfaces, against which the contact slide of the base bars is intended to abut at the beginning of or during the measurement when it is desired to refer tlte end of a base bar to a temporary mark in the ground. Its construction haYiug beeu sufilcieutly explained, it remains to point out the mauuer in which it is to be used In transferring an underr11·011nd mark to the surface.-By means of a small mirror light is reflected upon the underground mark. 'l'he collimator is mountell as nearly as may be O\'er the mark, with one of tlrn leYeliug screws in the direction of the line of measurement. The micrometer thread is set to the reading of the line of collimation. The telescope is made Yertical by means of the leveling scrnws, and the intersection of the cross threads is brought oYer the underground mark, as 11early as ma.v be, by moYing the telescope by means of the counter screws, the rnrticality of the tele1;cope being carefully presernd. Sewral pointing·s ou tlle m111ergrouwl mark are then rnade by rneaus ol' the filar micrometer, aud its readiug and that of the Je,·el are recorded. The telescope is theu revolYed 1130°, and the operation of pointing on the mark and reading the level is repeated. From these readings the horizontal distance of the line of collimation from the under-grournl mark becomes known in terms of the micromet-er. If, as originally contemplated, the undergromHl mark is a line rule<l between- two others at known distances from it, a measurement of the:,;e 1fo;tauce;.; will at once give the value of the micrometer in absolute measure. 1t is, howen·r, praeticahle to determine the Ya Ines of the micrometer for different distances lletween a mark· and tlie ohjPd.iH, and these ha\·ing bren tabulated will furnish by interpolation the Yalue for any distance between the det~rmi11e1l li111its, and to this or some otltcr method recourse nrnst be had if tht.'re is hnt one terminal line. One-ha] t' of the diameter of the collar between the almttiug surfaces will be the horizontal distance of the latter from the line of collimation.

The fact that the rate of a pemlulnm might be Ltrgely inttueneetl b,\· the ela..;tie yi<·lding of its support was first point~d ont by Dr. Thomas Young in his artide rn1 Tides i11 tlw E111:,n~lopa'<lia Britannica, 11·here he g·aye a eorrect matllematical anal.rsis of tl1e prohlem. Kater 111a1k use of thP noddy, or irfferted pernlnlnm of Hard~-, t.o assure himself that its support was snfticie11tl,\· i;;teady. Hard.Y's no1ldy is a peudnlnrn turni11;.;· witl1 a reed spri11g arnl 1n·o\·i1led with an ad.instahl.- hob. It differs from an ordinary pendulum, first, in bei11g upside <low11, that is, h:wiug its 1:e11ter of mass abo\·e its point of support; and secoud, in baYiug a spring i;o strm1g as to act a little more strongly than gravity.

In a note at them1d of this papPr I gi,·e the ma.thmnatical arialysis of this :state of tltiug:s, from whieh it will bes ·1~11 that Kater 111ig·l1t ha1·e ('Olliltl'lleted hill Hrnldy in 1mch a manner as to detect au;r amount of flexure sufficient to ha ye a serious eftect upon the period of his
pendulum.

Bessel, at the end of §3 of his great memoir ou the length of the seco111b' pt·rnlulnm at Kouigsberg, states that he also nsed Hard~·'" noddy, and tllat he swung his p1·11dnlum again after stiffening the >iupport. He adds that the eflect 011 the period would probabl,Y be the sam<' for his long pendulum as for bis short one-a n·ry just remark,--which rna1le it lel:'s 11ee<>ssar.v for him to attend to the rigidity of the stand. The construction of English pendulum supports, that of Hassevi, for example, shows that in that country this source of error was ne,·er overlooked. It is noticed eYe11 in brirf aecounts in English of the process of measuring gTadt_y. Tlms, a \Hiter in the Encyclop;·p1lia Hritanufr»a proposed to make nse of two difforent reversible pentlulnms of tlw same form hut of different weights, in order t-0 take account of the flexure, an idea latel_y borrowe1l b,r l\L Ccllerier. "\Vhe11 the reversible pendulum came into use the study of the writingR of the older observers seems to have been neglected,· aml the grave errors due to fiexnrP were nt·\·er suspcctml until Albrecl1t found a value of gravity at Berlin difforiug by nearly 2 millimeters from that of Bessel. So little was the true cause of this discrepancy at first suspected that it was para1loxically attributed to the neglect of a buoyancy correction. In 1875, however, General Baeyer gravelj· tmspected that the period of a pemlulum swi11giug upon a Repsold tripod was affecttid by the oscillation of the latter, aud in a circular addressed to the members of the committee on the pendulum of the International Gllodetic Congress, he wrote : ''The necessity of suspending the pendulum from a stand is a source of error, since it pendulu 111 swinging on a stand sets the latter into oscillation and so influences the rate of the former. 'fhe effect could be diminished by the use of a shorter pendulum and smaller stand; but whether it would be 'rendernd entire!.)' insensible. is open to question."
"ThUB, Bessel's idea of directly measuring the position of the center of mass was supposed by the Swiss 8avan8 to belong to M. Cellerier.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

It was at this ti.me that I first. received the Repsold apparatus from the makers, of whom it had been ordered two years before, on the occasion of my first beiug charged with the pendnlnm operations of the Coast Suryey. Becoming aequainted with General Bae;yer's doubts, I determined to settle the question by measuring the flexibility of the Repsold tripod at the earli(\St opportunity. This I did at Geneva, where, though I only made a rough measurement, I found that the flexnre was fully sufficient to aecount for the discrepancy between the tleterminatious of Bessel and of Albrecht. On September :l5 of the same year I comnmuieated my re~mlt to the standiHg committee of the Geodetical Cougre.ss. At the same sitting the reporl:; of the different mcmuen; of the pendnlnm commiltt'O were read. Dr. Bruhns said: "The quet<tion whether the stand is set into oseillatio11, arnl whether the rate of the pendulum is influenced thereby is, iu rn;1· opiniou: 1n~1l worth inYestigation. But I should suppose that the stand could he made so stiff as to elirnina te this source of error for a pendulum used only as a relatiYe rnstrument." The \·iews of l\L Hirsch, who is so much occupied with tbe going of time-keepers, are interesting. He said: ''The fear that the tripod of ;;;nspeusion may al::<o enter into oscillation, unless it be a fad. eRtahlisl1ed hy llireet observatioi1s, seems to me unfounded. Indeed, it cannot he supposed that there are auy trne oscillation:; of a bod~- of such a form resting on three points. Besides, the movemeut of the pemlulum whose mechanical moment (moment mecaniqucj is slight on account of its small \·elocity, could 0111,y be comm1111icated to the tripod by the friction of the knife oa the supporting plane. Xow, this frietio11 is insignificant, as the slowness of the decrement of the amplitude shows, this being almost entire!~· due tD tb.e rt>sistancc of the air.'' It may he observed that the rolling frictim1 of' the knife e<lge iH, in trnth, \·ery slight, but the amount of the sliding frietiou is sufficient to hold the knife in place on tlw supporting plane. Dr. von Oppolzer, the de!iigner of the lfopsold tripod i11 its detinit,i\·e form, said that the eorn;truction of th(' stand reudNe<l any seriout< flexure a priori improbable; hut. lw did uot support this opinion hy an~- ealculations. During the spring of 18'ifi, lun-i11g already measuretl the tlexihilit_y Df the triprnl in Paris, I !'erneasureil it ill Bt>rlin, wlw1·1· 111.Y ('X]H'ri1ne11ts \\'t'l'(' witll('SSed hy Om1eral n~ieyer a1i.l a party of gPntlmne11 attad1ed to the Prussian Sm\·ey. In October, 18/H, at the lllt'Pting; of' tlw stamling; committee of the International Geodetical U111ou at BrnHst·ls, tlie ret<ult of my l'XJ>l'I'iments was a1mom1cetl hy General Hmiyer. M. Hirsch describ(·d Ct'rtai11 t·xperimental researcl1es 1111ckrtake11 hy hi111 to ascertain whether there was an,Y t<nch flexure in the case of the Swi,;:,; tripod. He had, iu the first place, e111plo,ved an extremely t<ensith'e 1e,·el, which had not t>ntered iuto oscillation while the pendulum wa>: swinging upon it. It j,. not cll'itl' why M. Hirseh empio~·ed a Yer;1· sensitive leYel, the uatnral time of o;;cillation of which wo11ld diifor mu·\h more from the period of the pendulum than that of a less sensitive le\·d woul(l do. He also used au artifkial horizon iu the same way. M. Hirsch's conclnsiou ii; that "tbert· remains 1111 douht that the Swiss staml is free from every trace of such oscillations." Dr. rnn Uppolzer entirely agreed with the views of M. Hirsch. 111 the following· summer I addressed to l\J. Plantamour a paper upon the sul\ject, to he snhmitt.ed to the next meeting of the Geodetical Oougress. In this note, which it< reprinted at the ('D!l of the pre1:1e11t report, I :first give a mathematical analysis of the prohh·111. I next show experimental\~- that tht· motion of the knife.edge support is not a translation, hnt is a rotation, so that diff~·rcnt partt< of tht· head of the tripod, onl,Y a few centimeters di"tant from oue a11otlwr 1 move through Ycry difl't~rent 'listauces. Consequently, nH'afitues of the flexure rn:tde anywht·r~ !'xcept at. the center of the knife-edge plane require an important correetion before they can be used to eorreeL tlw periods. This is confirmed by experiments with a mirror while the pentlulmn is in motion. I next gin· a brief rh$u.11d of rn)' statical measures of the flexure. I thm1 giYe measures of the actnal flexure. nuder the oscillation of the pendnlum, au<l show that the statical and dynamical tlexibilities are approximately equal. Finally, I swing the same pendulum upon the Repsohl support and npon another having sereu times the rigi<lity of that. one, arnl I show that the differcuce of the periods of oscillation agrees with the tlieory. Immediately upon the reception of my manuscript, MM. Hirsch and Pla.utamour commenced new researches, designell to form an "Ctnde approfondie de ce pheuomene." These were embodied in a paper by M. Plantamonr, which was read to the Oeodetical CongresR, and which has since been

expanded into a memoir entitled "Recherches experimentales sur le mouvement simultane d'un pendule et de ses supports." M. Plantamour finds fault with me, first, for having- measured the flexure with a force five or ten times that of the deflecting- force of the pendulum; and second, for measuring the elasticity statically instead of dynamically. The reply to the first objection is that the properties of metals are known to a great extent, that elasticit;y is uot "une force capricieuse,'' and that no fact is better established thau that an elastic strain is proportional to tlie stress up to near the limit of elasticity, which limit was not approached in the author's experiments. As to the second objection, I had shown by experiment that the statical and dynamical flexures are nearly equal; and I am willing to leave it to time to show whether this will not be assumed in future measures of the flexure of future pendulum supports. M. Plantamour caused a fine point fixed into the head of the tripod to press against a little mirror, mounted on an axis; and then observed the reflection of a scale in a telescope. The length of the path of light from the scale to the telescope divided by the distance of the beariug point from the axis of the mirror he calls the grossissement; so that liad he used a fixed star in place of his scale, the grossissement would have been virtually infinite. From the given length of the lever it would appear that a movement of 011-.03 in the point would turn the mirror 4''· The aperture of the mirror is not stated, but it eannot be supposed that the error of obser\·ation would be less than this. It does not seem to me that the use of this mode of measurement, which magnifies the motion but little more thau my method, is conducive to accuracy, especially in investigating the difference betweeu statical and dynamical fiexure. A certain finite force presses toget.l1er the point and the lever. Dividing this force by the minute area of pressure, we find the pressure upon the metal is very great, approaching the crushing pressure. Now, the beliavior of metals under great pressure is greatl_y influenced by the time. But my objection is not merely theoretical; I have myself made experiments upon this method, and, making them as skillfully as I could, I still found great uncertainty in the results. The following table exhibits M. Plantamour's results:

The table used is the same one shown in Fig. 26 of the Coast Survey Report for 1877. The nmnbers in the last line above should show the eft"ect of the weight of;{ kilogrammes in dimiuish ing the flexure of this table under a horizontal force of 100 grammes. The weights used iu obtai11ing the first two numbers were about 100 grammes; but the last column is one-tenth the deflection produced hy 1,000 grammes. It seems quite incredible that 3 kilogrammes, laid on the table, shoulfl really have an effect of this magnitude, so closely proportionate, too, to the deflecting force. It is highly desirable that this result should be confirmed by imrely optical experiments; and until this S.Ex.49-46

is <lone, we must suspect that these large numbers indicate some error to which the method of obserYation is liable. It is certain that the comparator did not act as a brace to stiffen the instrtfrnent, and equally so that its weight is not sufficient to alter the modules of elasticity of the brass of the support. It would seem, however, that the effect might be due to a film of some semielastic substance under the feet of the tripod. When the tripml is on the floor, no such eftect is oh:;;errnd; when it rests 011 the Geneva pier t.he dynamical flexure is the same as when it is on the floor, hut the statical flexure if' much larger. On the Berlin pier the excess of the statical flexure over that on the GeneYa pier is fh:e times the dynamical excess. On the other hand, the excess. of the dynamical flexure ou the table m·er t.hat at Berlin is half ai,; great again as the statical excess.
MEASURES OF FLEXURE.

l\ly own 1rn~asurm; form two series, those made preVions tA1, aud thm;e made :mbsequent to the publication of M. Plant.amour's memoir. In the first series, I was simply occupied in measuring· tlte tlexure of the Repsold tripod, as well when properly puL 11p as wheu the nuts of the bolts were not tightened, of' the Geueva support as mounted at Hoboken, and of my ''stiffest" support. All the precise measures are statical, and, being made with a filar micrometer, are superior in accuracy to the subsequent ones. In the second series, the tlexures are alwa_ys measured dynamically as well as statically, and the statical flexure is always found to be the greatest. On the excessively flexible Repsold tripod the difforenee is sufficient to affect the length of the second's pendulum by 10µ. Nevertheless, ai,; the axis of motion is different for the two kinds of flexure, there are points at which the motion is less for dynamical thau for statical flexure. And in point of fact, when the Geneva support rests 011 the GeneYa tripod, thti dynamical flexure of the center of t11e knife-edge is [treater than the statical tlexure. Experimeuts were also made upon the effect of lea Ying the nuts of the Repsold tripod entirely loose, of tightening them as much as possible by the hand, and of tightening them by a wrench. It is found that there is little difference between leaving them loose and tightening them by hand, but the effect of the wrench is to produce a stiffening equivalent to a sliortening of the pendulum by 20 microns. Experiments were also made upon the effect of placing a weight of 13 pounds, and afterward" of 25 pounds, upon the head of the Repsold support. The first weight produced absolutely no effect; the second moved thf' a.xis of motion a little, and t.hns caused a slight difference of flexure at some pointi,;. Experiments were also ma<le upon the effect of resting tlte Rc11sold support nvou blottingpaper, upon blocks of oak, aud upon blocks of india-ruhber. In ever,\· cast~ the difference between the statical and dynamical flexure was much increased. The pendulum hail also been su·ung on all these different support:s arnl the period of oscillation determined with a view of ascertaining whether the statical or dynamical flexure should be used in calculating the corrections t-0 the periods. The result, as might have been predicted from the mathematical theory, shows that a value intermediate between the two is to be taken. But the best way is to make the support so solid that the difference of the two kinds of flexure must bt\ inconsiderable.
EXPERIMEN'l'S TO DETERMINE THE FLEXURE·CORREC'l'ION.

A.-Flexure of the Repsold stand.

To determine the flexure, a known force was applied statically t.o the stand, and t}je resulting deflection was measured. The principal experiments were made in the cellar of the Stevens Institute at Hoboken. The floor of the cellar is of brick laid down in cement directly on the solid ledge. The tloor having been carefully cleaned, the three brass pieces which support the screwfoet of the Repsold tripod were laid down upon it, and the tripod itself was set up. The bindingscrews of the feet were screwed up very tight. The pendulum, comparator, and meter were not placed on the tripod, but a mass of iron about equal to them in weight was placed on blocks on the lower part of the tripod in order to ballast it. To apply the force, a si1ken cord was wound round

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

the tongue upon which the pendulum usually rests, just in the slot over which is tlie miudle of the knife-edge, in such a manner that the cord when stretched horizontally was exactly at the level of the knife-edge. The cord passed horizontally and perpendicular to the knife-edge to a pnlle~·-wbeel over which it passed, and frow which it hung down vertically; and to its extrewit~- was attached a kilogramme. The pulley-wheel was one which belonged to an Atwood's machine; it turned with very little friction and itR rim was accurately plane and perpendicular to the axi>;. This 'vheel rested on a stout wooden tripod; its axis was carefully adjusted to be parallel to the knife-edge and the upper part of the rim was brought to the le,·el of the knife-edge. The mmal position of the knife-edge is here referred to; but the pendulum was not actually iu position. Iu the measurements of flexure, one person gentl_y raised and lowered this weight alternately. The measurement of the deflection was made b;r another person, as follows : A micrometer scale on glass was fixed, either to the tongue or to an arm solidly fixed to the tongue, in such a wa:r that the direction of measurement was parallel to the force applied to the tripod. This micrometer scale was obser·ed by a microscope magnif.ring about fifty diameters and provided with a filar miel'omctel'. This microseope was mounted on a separate, Yery stiff, iron stand resting on the floor, aud carrying at its head a brass apparatus for holding the microscope. The optical axis of the microscope was made exactly parallel to tlw knife-edge and the filar micrometer serew was made parallel to the force applied t-0 the stand, and the microscopf' was focused ou the micrometer scale. Each division of the scale usually employed was about 1'..l". The filar micrometer wire (which was Yertical) waR made to bisect one division of the scale and the micrometer was read; it was then made to bisect another dhision, by turning the screw tl1rough about one revolution, arnl the micrometer was read again. Thus, the \"aluc of the revolution was obtained. The weight was then put on, and pointings were made upon the same two divisions. Then, the whole process was repeated until the weight had been put on five times. This made one set of experiments. The following experiments were made to determine the position of the axifl of r11tatiou of the knife-edge support during flexure. HOBOKEN, Jlfarch IO, 1877.

A1> most of the sources of constant error tend to make the observed values too small, the larger result has been preferred. When the binding-screws of the feet were not perfectly tight the flexure was still greater, as iR shown hy tue following means of sets of ohsel'\'a.tions made under those circumstances:

It follows from this that the a.xis of rotation cuts the line of the knife-edge J66m"1 bebintl tl.Je center of the edge, and cuts tlie vertical from that center 68m"' below the edge. Also, that tilt' deflection of the middle of the edge under a force of I kilogramme's w1·ight is 3". t. This i11f·.J111les the flexure of the pier. C.-Ple;r11re of the Oenera. support and pier.

In measuring this tlexure, instead of a low· power microscope and filar micrometer a high-powm· microscope aud eye-piece micrometer were used. A stage micrometer WaR always obRerYed, and the value of the diviisions of the e~'e-piece micrometer determined by it. In ~be following expt!riment.s the scale was 254'""' above the level of tlie knife-edge and 25mw forward of the middle.

It will be seen that the effect of loosening the front taps is to increase the angular flexure about the instantaneous axis. But this axis is at the same. time brought forward, and the consequence is tha.t the flexure at the middle point of the knife-edge is not much changed. 'l'llat tlle flexure of the tripod alone, witllout that of the tongue supportiug the pendulum, appears, when measured, 4ocm hehind the middle point, to be greater than the combiued flexure of the two, is uo doubt due to the axis of flexure of the tongue cutting the leYel of the knife-edge only a short distance behind the middle point. The effect of loading the base of the tripod with brick;,; witR to make it slightly stiffer when wrench-tightened, and considerably stiffer when baud-tightened. All of these measures of flexure seem, however, to be in error, and it seem;; likely that the position of the scale, when in front of the stand, was not really 184""" as recorded, but perhaps iik4"""- \Vitli that change~ these measures would agree with others, which they do not now clo.

The following are dyuarnical measurements. The pendulum swung heavy end down; 21.4 div. of scale=.001 inch. Arc expressed in ten.thousandths of tile radius. t:;crews wnmch-tightened; scale 41cm.4 behind, ocni.7 above knife-edge.

These measures are interesting as showing that while the dynamical flexure at the point of application of the force is constantly less than the statical, yet the angular flexure is less in the statical experiments than iu .the dynamical ones. This fact probably indicates the cause of the difference between the two kinds of flexure, namely, that in the dynamical experiment.s the :tlexnr~wave has not had time to fully reach the distant parts of the apparatus. . ·

The siguificatio11 of tllis is that th~ noddy approaches indefinitely toward settling down to au oscillation strictl,y synehronous with that of the support. Its ultimate amplitude is Yery little less than half what the maximum amplitude would be without resistance. But the phase may differ rnr.v mueh from that of the motion of the sn1>1>ort. Namely, if the noddy is in precise adjustment to the period of the large iwndulum, its phase will be one quadrant behiml that of the support. If the umld~· uaturalls oscillates slower than the large pendulum, its phase may be anywhere from one quadrant in arrear to opposition; if the noddy naturally oscillates faster than the pendulum, it may he anrwhere from one quadrant behind, to coincidence. If, then, y is oue tenth of gravity, r 2 -.T 2 one tbousan<ltlt of a second, and S one tenth ot' a micron, the amplit"mle of movement of tbe nodd~· will be one thousandth of the radius, a quantity ca1Sily memmred with a microscope.

°NEW Yom'", .!uf.11 1:{, 1871. DEAR SIR: Ou taking eharg-e of the Uoast Survey researches upon g1:a,-ity, I ord<·red of Messrs. Hepsold a reYersible pendulum, to he a copy of that of the Prussia11 Geodt:>t.ical Institute. But the instrument makers were at that time so taken up with the com;truction of instrume1Jts for the Transit of Ymms, tbat the pendulum wa8 only ready iu tbe spring of 1-,7.i. I thPn went to Hamburg to receive it; and from Hamburg I went on to Berlin, where l fonnll ( ;e11eral lfat\'·er ratlwr dissatisfied with the rP.~Ult8 obtained with the Prussian iustrument. Iii:' specially mentioned tit(· flexibility of the tripod, a source of error which pendulum experimenters han 1rnrely never on·rlooked. The pendulum apparatus that I bad carried with me from America lia,·i11g heen rni1wd iu transportation, I was under the necessity of employing the new instrnment, and thercfon· undertook to measure and take account of the error in questiou. A pendulum support might be rickety, so that the pendulum ill it;; oscillations should throw the knife-edge plaue from one position to another, without it1:1 undergoing a11j- reshitance to tl1t· motion other than inertia and friction, !Jetweeu two fixed points. This, howPYer, does uot happe11 in the case of anj· of the snpport1:1 that I ha,·e examined; for, upon obsen·illg their heltavior nrnler a high-power microscope, I liave alwa,ys found that they ;:;pri11g hack exactly to their orig-inal position after every tlexure that I ha,-e applied to tl1em. In short, the movement with which we l1art· to do is the oscillatory ficxure of an elastic hod~-. The amplitude of the oseillatio11 is, at rno.;;t. about 5 0100 of that of the lower knife-e(lge of the pendulum, 80 that it8 8qnare ma;;- be 11eglede\l. The pla11e of support of the kuifo is it8elf' nudoubiedly bent during the moveme11t; but J neglect this aud limit myself to the consideration of the mornment of its middle poi11t. '\'hen to this middle point is applied a horizontal force perpendicular to the knifo edge, the latter de.scribes a movement. of revolution aronnd an axis whicl1, iu the case of tlle Repsoltl ap11aratus, is situated bellintl and above the tripod at a <listancl' of about a meter from the knife.edge. "\Ye can neglect the difference between tl1i8 moYement and a translation, until we come to m1~a:,;nre its amom1t. There is also a minute variation in the Yerti<~al pressure of the pendulum 011 the snp1)ort, but this i1; YM,Y far from producing a11~· sensihle effect 011 the perio1l of oscillation.

In making these observations, I saw distinctl;y the little subsidiars dbratio11 at the end of ea-011 oscillation arising from the secoml term of the formula. Finall~', I swung the pendulum 011 two supports of different fie.xibility-mw. was the metallic tripod, by Repsold, to which refer tl1e flexure measurements giveu abow"; the other was made hy fixing the upper part of the Repsold tripod to a thick wooden plank b~· means of bronze bolts passing through the tl1ree holes through which the feet pass. These holes are conical, and the bolts fit exactly. I put on each bolt betwee11 the head of tlie support and the plank a leadeu washer, so that, in tightening the bolts and compressing the washers, great stabilit,y was obtained and at the same time a horizoutal position. The plank (which was 5 centimeters thick) was cut in order to make a place for the 1w11dulum, and it was placed by force between a stone wall and a briek 1dllar. A slit was then cut, in which a pulley of an Atwood machine was placed to mPasure the flexure. E.Ip1wiment,s on the ffexiire of this sitpport.

ON THE INL·'Lm;NuE OF INTERNAL FRICTION UPON THE CORliECTLON OF THE u:;..;tn'll OF THE SECOND8 PENDULUM FOH THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE SUPPORT.

It has heen showu hy Prof. A. JH. Mayer that the only sensible resiista11ce to the motion of' a tuning-fork is proportional to the ·rnlocity. In the caise or a slowly vibrating body the chief elfect is probalily due to that lagging o! the istraiu after the stress, which Weber has calle(l the elastic <tfter.eft'ect (Nachwirk1t1tf/). The inflnence of the former mode of resistance upon the period of oscillatiou of a. pe111lnlum oscillating· 011 au elastic tripod is easily eitlcnlated. The same thing caunot, iu m.v opinion, be effected for the other kind of resistance, in the present state of our knowledge; nevertheless, the mait1 eharactet'isties of the motion mas be made out. Put t, for tl1e time; <p, for the instantaneous angle of 1lellectiou of the pe1;tlnlnm; .~, for tlte instantaneous horizontal displacement of the kuifl:'-edge from its positiou of t·quilihrinm~ iu consequence of the flexure of the support; l, for the length of the corresponding Rimple pemlnluw; h, for the dista11ce from the knife-edge to the center of mass of the pendulum; ff, for the acceleration of gravitJ; y, for the ratio of g to the statical displacement of the point of support, which would be pr(l(luced by a horizontal force equal to the weight of the pendulum; a, for the coefficient of internal frictiott supposed proportional to the \'elocity. Then the differential equations are

lD 2 ,<p+D2 ,s=-g<p liD 2, <p+D 2,s=-ys-aD,s
The solution of these equations will be of the form (using the ratio of circumfen·nce to diameter):

Before proceeding to the consideration of the elastic after·efl'ect, I propose to apply the equations thus obtained to the calculation of the correction of the seconds' pendulum for the :flexure of the stand, supposing the internal friction to be proportional t-0 the velocity. For the pendulum used by me we have the approximate values-l= U){); h (heavy end up)=0.30; h (heav,y end down)=0.70; g (New York)=0.993x@2 =9.89; , =4 706; 111=1.00. y = u.-.n1012 12 1 The accompanying table shows that .;1 =0.000008. From this we calculate that with heavy end up t;2 =0.08, 172=257; with heavy end down &2 =0.1 I, 172 =39~. From this it appears that the correction of 'h is absolutely insensible, or, iu otlier words, the effect of resistance (supposed proportional to the velocity) vanishes. That this is nearly, in fact, the case for iµy instrume11t is shown h,y the circumstauce that the times of oscillation upon stands of different rigidities agree with the mines calculated in leaving the internal friction out of account.

UNITED STAT"ES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

439

M. Plantamour proposes to determine the effect of the internal friction of the pendulum sta-nd upon the correction for flexure, b.r means of the difference between the statical and rlynamical tlexurl'. He has made numerous obsen·ations, wbicli, accoriiing to l1is own interpretation of them, would Rhow that, if a pendulum be supported in a certain. inclined position until the stand has hail time to take its position of equilihriurn under this force, aud then be let go, the ratio of the amplitude of oscillation of the stand to that of the pendulum is not the initial one, but is very different from that. If this were the case, tlie motion of the stand and pendulum could not be represented, even approximately, iu the form (1 ), for by those equations the logarithmic decrement of the oscillation of the stand is the same as that of the pendulum. It is true that the two partt:1 of the oscillation (nearly in the uatnral periods of the pendulum and of the st tnd) have different logarithmic decrements; and, as the ratio of their amplitudes is uot the same for the stand and for the pendulum, a certain change in the total relatiYe amplitude might occur in this way, but only an excessh·ely minute one, nothing like what .\1. Plautamour thinks he bas observed. But it is so improl>able that the motions of the stand and pendulum depart much from the forms (I) that if would be wrong to accept M. Plantamour's results until· they are confirmed by a purely optical observation free from au.r possible influence from the machinery attached to the stand. Such an obsen-ation has been made by me, and, though I admit it was rather rough, it is entirely opposed to M. Plantamour's conclusions. Should the latter be confirmed, the:· would totally nullify the attempt to correct, for the effect of flexure, as they would show the inapplicabilit.v of the analysis which has been proposed for the 8olution of that problem without affording ns much hope of' being able to replace it; and it would seem to be necessary in tlrnt case to reject all the work which has been done with the reversillle pendulum. If the pendulum were started in the manner proposed, and if for any cause the amplitudes of pendulum and stand were altered in different, ratios, there would be a perpetual force at work tending to restore the old ratio, so long as the phases of the motion were the same in the pendulum and stand. But, if the pliases differed, a part of this force would go to diminishing the amplitudes, and would act so strongly in this way that there would be a rapid decrement on account of this circumstance.. Suppose, fur instance, that in the difforential equations we were to imt instead of D/8, D,2s1, where 1:1 is the value of s at a time later than t by a constant. The result. of this would be (neglecting terms involving a) that instead of the square of the exponent of the Naperian base being the sum of two negative quantities, one of tbem veQ· small compared with the other, the smaller of these quantities would be multiplied by an imaginary root of unity. Thi;.; would have but little effect ou the imaginary part of the exponent of base, which determines the period; but it would add a considerable real part, which would represe11t a corresponding decrement of arc. It seems difficult to conceive of a force wl1ich should great!~- change the relath'e amplitudes of oscillation of the pendulum and stand, without at tue same ti.me producing an enormous decrement of the amplitude of oscillatio11, such as certainly does not exist. It is for those who believe that the·existence of such a forue has been experimentally proved to show how great <in effect it would have upon the period of ORcillatio,n. 1\f. Plantamour supposes that the formula given by me in my paper, "De l'infiueuce de la tfexihilite du trepied elll' l'oscillation du pendnle :'t reYersion," would still apply to such a case; hut I am unable to see upon what ground. Meantime, in the preRe11t sta.te of the questiou, it appears to me that we must appeal to iiirect experiment to determine the difference betwt-en the time of oscillation on a stiff' and on a flexible stanii. Such experiments were giYen by me in the 11a11er <ibove mentioned, and I have since greatly multiplied experiments on a stiff stand, with the general re1-mlt there announced, namely, that the difference is slightly greater than my theory supposes (owing, 1wrhaps, to neglecting the energy of movement, of tl1e support), a11d not smaller, as M. Plantamour's views would require.

THE DEfll'CTIOX OF THE ELLIPTlCITY OF THE EARTH FROM PEXIWLl'i\! EXl'El:JMENTf'.

_\uy conedio11 to pe11dnln11i experimeub.; ''ho:'ie maguitn<le cliaugc:-; pi·ogTe:-;:-;in~Jy with the latit1ule lll~l>tl:-; to he Yl'l'Y a('1~uratelj· determined, lrn;t an t·rror be thereby introduced into the rmmlting \'al11e of tlie ellipticity of the earlli. The at111ospheri(: JH'es:mre and the temperature botli give rise to co1Tec1io11:-; of this class, and t!J;; codlicient:-; of these 1·orrections !Jan· heeu, iu general, very i11atleqnat(>ly <leter111illlc'tl. The experi1ue11t8 \Yl1ich hal'I:' 1·e(:ently been published in the fifth \'OlnmP of tlw India Snn·t',\', lioweYer. sufiieim1tly llctcr111i111· these t~oefficients fOl' the Kater im·ariable pendnh1ms. For all otltPr forms of pendnlnms which ltan! beeu used, excepting tlw large. sized Repsolil l'lfft'rsible pemlulnm, their Yalues are qnite nucntain. But by far the greater part of the ntluahle data at hand in reference to the relatini force of graYit~' in different latitudes i·onsist of the time;;; of oscillation of Kater innnfable pendulums. So that even were we able proper!,\· t.o correet the others for temperature and pressure they would haYe wry little iufluence npon the resulting ellipticit,y, for their absolnte uuml.Jer is small, all(l tlwy are not n~efnlly distril;nted in latitude. Subject to nncertaintie8 of reduction as tl1ey arP, the only appreciable effect of admitting them into our calculations would be to increase the apparent probable error without altering the result. Un<ler these circnrnstances, it has S(·emed best to me i11 making a 1ww calculation of the ellipticity, as derin·d from this class of experiments, to restrict' m:n;elf exclusively to those made with the Kater invariable pendulums.* The coefficient of the effect of atmos;pheric pressure npon pendulums of this class wa,i; determiued iu 1829, by Sabiue, allll the later researches under the auspices of the Indian Snney have Bol seriously iuvalidated his determinations. Baily, iu his report on Foster's pendulum experiments, undertook to correct all the former results for this l'ffect, but hiR work is erroneon:s in several particulars. Thus, he applies the correction to 1Aitk1~'s numbers, to which it had already l1een rigl1tly applied; he omits to reduce Sabine's values to the level of the sea, and commits various other cnors which cannot be so easily explained in a few· words. For tlw coefficient of temperature effo('.t a value ha" mm ally been assumed which was first obtained by Kater, and which is entirdy incompatible witl1 the known coefficient of the expansion of brass and witl1 the experiments npo11 the periods of oscillatiou at different tempe1;atures. The value atloptetl in tht' re~luctioms of the India Suney for pe11c1ulum No. 4, which wa1' one of 8abine's pendnlmus, <·oiucides precisely with that fonnd by 'Liitke; differl'! very little from that obtai1wd hy the Indian Sm\'ey for tl1Pir other pendulum, salisties well the experiments by t::l<tlliue at different temperatures, agrees with 0111· gP11eral lrnowletlge of the coeflicicut of expa11sio11 of brass, aml has conseqnentl.r heeu 111rnle use of by me in the reduction of all the experiments made with the Kater invariable pendulumH. I han, thPrefore, made the necessary corrections to all the result;; witli these peJl(lulums, with the i'Xl'eptiou of those of t.110 Indian series au<l of Liitke, which I haYe suppo8ed to have been right!,\' reduced. The corrections for elevation of the station aho\·e the level of the sea ha8 hitherto bcen rnatle h~· Dr. Youug's rule, which is hased on the assumption that all the earth an<l rock rising above the level of the sea is to he (mni-;idered as attracting the pendulum as if it was so much additional matter heueath the pel!(lnlnm iu excess of what i." found at the lernl of the sea. That this assumption, so foreign to the facts of the case, does not accord with the determiuations of gravity made at the isea shore, and at gTP.at. t·le.\'ations in the neig·hhorhoo<l, has often bee11 pointed out; in par· ticnlar b~- M.

It has al wa;y8 been assumed that the secoud term of the polynomial in the pareutliesis would alone be sensible except in extreme cases. If, uow, we eoneein· that the eleYation, instead of being producerl by tlw :iuuition of new matter, has beeu produced hy the upheaval of the crust of thiekne;;s t, then the ~1nantity in the parenthesis becomes

t Ji

\l~;·.;-t2"
It will be secu that ti.tis term, which is the principal part of the whole expression, is nearly inversely proportional to the raditrn of the cap, so that a largl' e;qi will han· Jes;;; rlownwar<l attra<'tion than a small one. The reasou of this is as followK: 'l'hrough auy poi11t, p, let a line he drawn in a n'r'tical direction; througl1 p let a sphere he describerl having its cm1ter upon this line. Taking)! as tl1P origin of polar co·ortlinates, let a new surface be described luwing the radius Yeetor in an:· direction equal to that of the sphere. 'rben this surface will be the surfa(·e upon which a particle of matter anywhere placed will exert a constant rnrtical attraction upon the point p. As the center of the sphere varies its position along the vertical Iiue thro11gh p, a HUcccssiou of these inclo;;;ed surfaces of equal yertical attraction will IJe formed all in contact with one another at the point p. It will be Heen then that the nearly spherical surface of the eart,h cuts all these surfaces iu such a manner that the uplifting of the particles auywhere on its surface other than tlw immediate neighborhood of p will diminish the vertical attraction upon p. 'flit> exact ca,Jculation of the effect of the eleYation of a crust, being extremely troublesome, and the quantity being small, I b:wc thought it sufficient to assume that the downward attradion would be one-tenth of the correction for eleYation. This quautit,y which was adopted as satisfying moderately wrll the (1xperime11ts 011 neighboring high and low levels is equivalent, to assuming that the thickness of the crust is about one-eighth of the diameter of the space arched over; and the assumption has the same effect as if it were supposed that the continental elevations were produced by additional matter 11aviug- three-fourths the density ot' wa.ter.

We ham so far onl.v considere<l the solid material of' the cruo;t. In addition to this there is th(' water, which simply rnus down to the lowest levels; so that its whole attraction is to be considen~d and allowe1l for. J,et us consider a small island lyi11g in the midst of the sea. lu the first place, if there were no water about it, the gradt.r would be iu excess upon sueh an islau<l in couse1pw11ce of the 1lepressin11 of rlio ~ea-bc<l around it. This excess may, as we ha\'e seen, be roughly taken as equal to wlrnt -wonlll be produced by tlie downward attraction of a11 excess of matter sntlicient to build np tht:> islarnl aml having three-fourtils the density of wat<'l'.

This probable error is rather smaller thau thatohtained by the treatment of the late,.;t and best geo1letical operations and is nmcli smalh'r than that obtaiue1l l1itherto from pPnrlnlnm obser,·ntions. Upon comparing rn~- residual,.; with tlwse of Clarke (fi-eodesy, p. 34!}), it will be obserY!'U that, as a general rule, the residuals that iiow remnin larg·e had pre,·iousl.r been mncb larger, and are generally marine 8tations, from wheuee I infer tlrnt a more careful e:,;timate of tlw attraction of the ocean would produce a still further improYcmeut of the result. That wi.Jieh is most needed to im1ir0Ye the state of our knowledge of gra\'ity are additional CXJHcriment.s i11 the Arctic Circle. It is desirable t!Jat these experiments slwuld be made with the IIJ(lia11 apparatns, aud it is also to be desired that tlw same apparatHs should be uscu at Triuidad, Ascension, an<l :\Lmrnham, the three stations which are common to tlie great expeditions of Sabi11e and Foflte1'.

ON A .METHOD · F OUt\EiffINO THE COINCIDENCE OF VIBHATJO:"i OJ' TWO PENDCLl;MS.
Hy C. S.
PF~IRCIC,

N1;w ¥ORK, August 2, 1878. DEAR Sm: 1 luwe ma<le a foll set of experiments with differeut methods of observing the coincidences of two pendulums. By far the most accurate method is the following:

I

-::::Eve

I: F

~

To the wall A of a small chamber is fixed a clock which carries on its pendulum a brilliantly illuminated horizontal scale, say of half millimeters. B represents the middle point of this scale. C or 0' is a large achromatic lens placed so that an image of scale will be formed at B' at a fixed distance from the wall. There are two positions, C and C', which the lens may have to effect this. In one position the amplitude of vibration of Bis multiplied in a certain ratio, say r; in the other position it is diminished in the same ratio. This is a well-known optical principle. The lens moves in a slide, by means of strings, and up to stops, so that it can he drawn at any time from one of these positions to the other. At DD is the plane of oscillation of the pendulum on knifeedges, which measures the force of gravity. The plane of motion of D is parallel to that of B. This pendulum carries a lens which brings the image at B' at focus at E close to the opposite wall F of the room.· When the amplitude of Dis to the amplitude of B' as ED is to EB', the image remains stationary at E, provided the pendulums are in coincidence. The image E is observed by means of an eye.piece, G, fixed in the wall. The effect is this: The lens C being in the position (J (the nearer t-0 B), and the pendulum D S.Ex.49-58

oscillating at nearly the right amplitude, the image of the scale will generally tlash across the field of vision Ro rapidly that it can only be seen at the instant of reversing its direction. But as the penduh1ms approach coinci<lence it moves less and less, and if the two amplitudes are precisely iu the right proportion it finall~- comes absolutely to rest with the middle of the scale just on the cross-wire of the eye-piece (i. e., just where it would be with the pendulums both at rest). As a general rule, however, it does not come absolutely to rest, but finally gets over, say a millimeter in a second, after which it begin,; to mo,-e fa8ter. The approach to and departure from the minimum amplitude is not ,-ery gradual hut rather sudden, so that there is no difficulty at all in deciding which is the minimum oscillatio11. 'l'he obRerver has to note at what second the minimum oscilllttion occurs, and also what part of the scale is on the cross-wire at tl1e turning points before and after this oscillation; then, by the applicatiou of a formula, the time can readily be determined to near 1filth of a secornl. The lens C is then pulled forward to the position C', am! the obi;ervatiou is repeated when the pendulum has diminished its arc of oscillation sufficiently. The formula which applies is aR follows: Lets be the apparent oscillation of the scale; then, 11=a·1 cos (b1t+c1)-a2 cos (b2t+0ii)

By observing the value of s on the turning points of the :smallest oscillation the amplitude will give (a1 -a2 ), and the difference of amplitudes on the two sides will give dt to about a sixth of a second on substituting in the last rquatiou the k11owu values of a2b1 aml b2 and the value of a 1 determined from the amplitude. This will determine the time to about 1 ,f6 0 of a 1'eco11d. My opinion, however, is, that the best way of making pendulum observations is with m,y relay described in my printed paper.

NOTE.
Since witnessing Ma;jor Herschel's experiments, I have done some additional work with the method cf coincidences. I have used a scale of half millimeters pasted on the clock pendulum, and brought to focus by a good lens, on the plane of oscillation of the point of a fine cambrie needle placed vertically on the gra"ity pendufum. The correction for decrement of arc-an effect Major Herschel detected and for which Mr. Farquhar has obtained a formula--is considerable in the case of the reversible pendulums. I have read off its value from a diagram constructed for the purpose. FEBRUARY 20, 18&1.

ON THE VALUE OF GRAVITY AT PARIS.
By C. S. PEIRCE, Assista11t.

1'be ver,r good agTeemeut het.wee11 tlte figures giveu by Borda aud 1Hot for the \'alne of at Paris, and the qimutit.y found by Kater at r~oudou, reduced to Paris by means of the transportation of irffariable pendulums, gives us great confidence in the exactuess of the re;mlt. The three values for the length of the seconds pendulum are as follows:

Now, it is not necessarily to be suppm.;ed, before ha,·ing made t.he computations, that this correction Ahould he the same for all three pendulums; Borda's being· composed of a plati11um hall aud an iron wire -Imeters long; Biot's bfling the same platiuum ball, to which was attached a copper wire 0"'.fJ long; and that of Kater heing made of brass, a111l irrt'gnlar i11 form. Bnt the effect of the atmosphere upon a sphere suspended by a thin cylinder cau be exact]~· milcnlatt'tl by the formulw which .Mr. Stokes has given in his important memoir 011 this subject. 1'wo 1·.le111rn1ts nuit.e. in producing this effect; one ariAes from simple atmospberi<' pressure, and the other from chat property of tl1e air which the English physicists call vi.scosity, and the Germaus internal friction. 'l'o cal<"ulate this last element we must take tl.!e value of the vi1u~osit.r of the air' gin·11 h.v modern experiments, those of Maxwell, for instance. Stokes adopted a rnlne for the viscosity much too small. 'fhis affects especially the values expressing the eftect11 of the i·iscosity 011 tlle suspended wires, anrl this is why his comparisous between obsen'ation and theory do not :show the true value of the latter. The atmospheric effect on the caps attaching the platinum ball, and on the sides of the chamber in which the pendulums of Borda and Biot were swung, can be approximately calculated. Of course these corrections are confirmed as well hy tlH' obserrn.tio11s of the pendulums at <lifforent pressures as by analysis. Biot.'s observations were also affected hy the oscillation of the supports. In regard to the supports used by Borda, according to his description, I believe them to have been ''ery solid, anti the correction to be applied to the \'alue of gravity, being inversely proportional to the length of the pendulum employed, must be small in this case. Biot's supports are still at the obserrntory; however, they have received two moditi.catimts: 1st, the sides have been strengthened hy two cross-pieces; 211,-,he piece which held the pendulum has been replaced by another, which is \'ery solid. With the kind permission of Admiral Moucbez I took off the cro:sis·pieces and measured the flexure of the supports (still provided with the new head), sul~jected to the effect of a force of 2 kilo11. and 5 kilos., applied in a horizontal direction.

In order to appreciate the effect prodncert, not by the large support, but hy the little piece which supported the pendulum in Riot's experiments, a careful experimental study will be necessary, aided with the application of a theory entirely different from that which is applicable to elastic supports. For the present I neglect this effect. Applying the other corrections I get the following numbers:

If we adopt Se\·tm microus as the efl:ect of the unknown part of the fl.exure of Biot's support,
it will be seen that far from weakening our confidence in the exactness of the obsen·atious of those

illustrious physicists, our corrections ouly bring int-0 agreement their results. The number expressing the result of m.r experiments (9!13.934) differs sensibly from the others. Nevertheless, a careful study of all sources of error has couvinced me that it is correct within 10 mierons. The length of the seconds pendulum at Paris, eaJcnlated from the ex1wriments of Kater, is t)U>J}!)387; that lS, Shorter than lllJ cleterminatiOIJ h;v t)n>lll,t)7, If We place Confidence in the e:xperi· men ts of Genera,l Sabine, .made with Kater's p\',ndult1m at different pressures, we must a<ld to his measure a correction not less than omm.16, which is two times too great for the agreement of the determinations. Rut General Sabine made too fow experiments to el'ltablish so improbable a result. We can, therefore, assert uothiug from the experiments of Kater. In any case, I think, I have sufficiently proved by wb"at precedes, that the number heretofore given for the value of gravity at Paris must be increasell by its l ten-millionth part.

NOTE.
In my report upon tl1e Measurement of GraYity at Initial Stations, the unit of measure used is derfred from the German )formal Meter So. 49. But Professor Forster has commlnicated new data with reference to the correctfon of that har, in com1equence of which it appears that the assumed meter of my publication was 16.6 microns too short. In an article in the .American Journal of SciNice, Vol. XX, October, 1880, it is stated that the United States Otlioo of Weights and Measurt·s makes the same meter 19.2 microns too short. But this sta.tement assumed the oommittee

meter to be correct. Accor(ling to Barnard aud 'fre8ca, howenw, this meter is 3.4. microni; too long. Tht- meter of rn;.· paper is, therefore, B_y the German comparisons, 16.6 By the Auwricmi cmnpari;;ons, 15.8

too short. Applying the mean of these corrections, rnx rnlue of the seconds' pendulum at Paris becomes Om.99:W175, which is substantiall,,- ideutical with the Yalue from Bor<la's corrected experiments, and is probably very elofle to th(· correct couclusion from Biot's work.
Oorrection.-Ou page 432 above, the heading ·'Dynamical Flexure" is not in the original. This heading correctl_y describes the experinwnts, but thifl phrase was first used later by Professor Plantarnour.-fC. 8. P.]

REPORT ON A /\'.EW Hl'LE POH CURRENT:'< IX VEJ,AWAlrn BAY AND HffER.
By HENRY Mr.rCHEJ.L, .'!.,.,.,i,.tant Coast and Geodetic Survey, in charge of' .Physical
Hydrograph~r.

BOSTON,

January 12, 1882.

DEAR Sm: I submit berewitb a rule which, 1 hope, may be of some service to the mariner.

The amount of labor it represents is rather more nearly in proportion to this hope than to its real merits, perhaps, but my experience leads me very earnestly to recommend that the times of the currents (so much more im1>ortant, u15ually, than the heights of the tide) should be furnished, if not on our charts, at least i11 the Coast Pilot, and that. this information be in t.11(' customary language of seamen. Hoping that, in itis proper form~ you will adopt this rule, I am, Yours, respectfully,

HENRY MITCHELL.
Prof. J. E. HILGARD, Superintendent Coast and Geodetic Survey.

PROPOSED NEW R f!LE FOR THE CURRENTS OF DELA WARE B.d Y AND RIVER.

In all of our harbors and bays s11bject to tidal influence the presence of landwaters, from rivers or smaller drains, renders the epochs of slackwater variable by irregularlJ augmenting the ebb-cnm:mt while climinishing the ftood, so that tables embracing these elements are often misleading. In many cases the onl;r epochs that can safely be given to the navigator are those of m11ximum ebb and maximum ftood which are not affected by any Jaudwater supply that cau be regarded as constant for six hours. It would he exceeding I~· difficult to determine the time of maximum velocity, because of the n~r.r gradual change in the rate of movement near the strength of the current, were it not that the curve representing this movement, from slack to slack, is usuaJJy symmetrical, and even wJ1ere this is not the case the middle time from the whole curve has been found, from great averages, to fall at maximum. Another advantage in tl1e nse of middle time lies iu the eliminatiio11 of the diunial ineq11alitythis inequality, M1 rt~gards inten·al after moon's transit, having oppmiite signs at consecutive slacks. Still another advantage lies in the elimination of the effects of steady winds which enter as oonstants in so short a period as six hours, so as not to affect the time of maximum velooity of

current.
Our manner of computing tl1e middle time calls into use every observation. We plot these observations upon profile paper, from slack to slack, then draw a line down from the summit of the carve so as to biaect all the chords, and the mean time of this line is the ·middle time sought.

In the tables at the close of this report, lfr. J. A. Sullivan, of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, has compiled anew the excellent observations of Lieut. J. R. Goldsborough, made for our service in 1847, to which have been added the new data from Assh;;tant H. L. l\farindin's snn·ey of 18il-'i8 and 1881. From these tables I gather but one rule that bolds good at all seasons; this rule, bow ever, is, I submit, a very useful one.
RULE.

When the nwon souths the ebb-c-urrent at the entrance to Delaware hay and th~jlood.current at Philadelphia are at their strength. At the intermeniate reach, known as the "Bight of ~ew Castle," the strengt1i of the .twod occurs three hours before, a ud that of the ebb three hours <~f'for the southing of the moon.
In the above rule ea.ch of the two clauses presents an antithesis which assists the memory, and the two,clauscs taken together imply, as they should, progressive change anrl grarlnal reversion At the entrance to the Bay the rvle applies correctly to the grand channel nt-arly lllidway between Cape May and Cape Henlopen, while at Philadelphia its application falls in the neighborhood of Uichmond, with a sl1ift either way due to kalf-montltly ·inequality. It sometimes happens, when a great freshet occurs iu the upper river, that the ftood currellt is obliterated at Phila<lel1,hia1 but still the rule holds good practically, for it predicts the times of greatest and least outflow. The familiar word ''strength," which bas already been adopted by the Coast and Geodetic Survey t-0 replace the technical term "middle time" in the_ heading of tables for pnhlication, comes in rather awkwardly in the extreme case just mentioned, but it can never deceh·e.
*This method first

NOTE. Relative to the times of high and low u:ater in Delaware Bay and River.
It bas seemed to me that in the case of a long arm of the sea like Delaware Bay, it would be

better to write across the face of the chart the times of the tide in proper location, rather than to gh'e these times in a separate table for points where acutally observed, provided we could. get enough data to determine the law of tidal propagation. At your request 'capt. Wm. Ludlow, United States Engineer in charge of the improvements in Delaware Bay, sent to me the tidal observations that he bad caused to be made, and which had been referred to the breakwater as a standard station. These observations, when plotted for time and distance, gave such smooth curves that I wrote to Captain Ludlow inquiring if any formula for adjustment hacl been applied. He replied that there bad not, and that the only liberty taken had been to refer any station of brief occupation to the next one above and below and balance the differences. 'l'his was before any careful table of distances had been made out. I give below the observations as furnished, with two additional columns containing the elements of the best fitting parabolic curves. These curves furnish the law of propagation in the sense that I have employed the phrase before, but in no wider sense than a local rule for interpolation. The formulre usetl are y = 2.2 x + 0.018 x2 and y' =3.4 x + 0.018 af', in which'!/ is the time of high and y' the time of low water respectively, while :r: is the distance from the breakwater in nautical miles, measured along the channel-way. I never before have seen observations of natural phenomena fitting so perfectly to a simple theory. It seems to me that here we have a case where local names can be dispensed with, and the times placed on the chart at eqni-dj!!ltant points without fear of error. The true establiskmenta of the breakwater have not yet been com.pated.
