.

report is for Ghe fiscal year ended June 30, 1924, and is the uine~yc th.ird a~nual report of this .bureau. · · · INTRODUCTIO.N

SIR:. There is submitted herewith iny tenth annual report.

:Washington, October 6, 19YJ4. This

Th~· Const and Geodetic Suney has jnst closed the one hundred and eighth year of its active existence and, as in the case of last year, · it has been a successful one. The fact that the bnrean has a generally well-satisfied, high-class personnel, and the elimination of a majority of its inefficient ships replaced by modern ones, is in a large way responsible not only for various sncc<>ssful accomplishments, .but als? for a much greater amount of work being completed at a lower umt cost than c\·er before. In this introduction I will endeaYor to point out bril.'f\y some of the accomplishments, and in Part I indicate onr most pressing neeCls combined with reasons, from an economical standpomt, why the.v should not be put off from year to year.
THE EFFECT OF IXCREASED SALAIUES

In my report last year reference was made to the effect on the Government personnel due to legislation making it possible for the increase of salaries; that is, the legislation generally known as the reclassification act. Since this legislation became effective there has been a problem of concentrated effort on the shoulders of tho:.~ charged with putting the machinery in operation to give every immediate benefit to ('\'ery individual that properly could be benefited imd<>r this law. It is not strange that the act itself, which might be considered in its various stages ns having been worked over :for nearly half a century, should contain di~crepancies resulting in some confusion, hut· to. those who have studfod the history of this legislation and understood both sides of the many questions that have arisen it ·is r.~ally gratifying that Con~ess was able to offer so much' relief at th~ start to the unde~·pnid uovernment employees. The· whole mat; '' . !' .

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

ter should appeal to all as a great constructive step taken by the late President Harding and Congress, which certamly has paved the way for ultimate uniformity and fairness to all the civil employees in the Federal Government. It is a fact, and necessarily so, that everybody could not be satisfied with the first results of an interpretation of the act, but it seems, considering the comparatively short limit of time that those in charge have had to work over this tremendous problem, that their untiring efforts and conscientiousness should bear a mark of approval and appreciation by those who have been materially .benefited by this act of Congress. The conclusion is that CongreS's has made. it possible for a hnppier and more substantial existence for the Government employees and that the machinery for interpreting the authority gfren by Con.s-ress has been generally well handled'!,,. considering the great task anc:I the time within which to do it, and J. have not a doubt _in Yiew of the :facilities that are offered by CongreS'S to hear those who see inequalities, injustices, and ambi~ities in the act but they will be ready to consider changes that will carry in full force later the full intent of Congress when it passed the bill. The results of this legislation are far-reaching. Not only ha~ it taken the Gov· ernment worker from a mere existence to a state of contentment of mind and bodv, but the investment that the Government has made by this or any other salary increase will be returned to the country at .a higher rate of interest than almost any other investment the country has or can make. · ·.
l'HF.SEN'f HETIHIDfF.XT INADEQUA'l'f:

.. Cl~sCJy interlocked with the relief of the Government employee by increased salnri1:>s is tlw question of retiremen~ .. _Under th~ present law the nwtholl. ns well as the terms of retirement, are ma.de" quate an<l in~quitable. The ch·il employee to-day 'who serves th~ Governnwnt for 30 to 50 years must retire at 70 years (and in some cases at fii'i or H:2) at the rricage'r sum of not exceeding $60 per month~ This arLitrar~· and meager amount mnst Le accepted ifrespective of what the rnluP of the employee has been t.o the Government or what range of salary he might have received during the various .stages of his actiYity. . . ·A ~oncrete instance, which tells by true facts a sad case, which no dy11bt has been repeated ·over ai1d ovei· again throughout the Gornrnment. is lmrnght out in the case of Ernst G. 1.<'ischer, who ,,vas. the mechanical engineer of this bureau for 35 years. In 1922 he l~ad re~1ched the salary of $3,000 per annum and he had also come t.o the retirement age of .70. ~Vith his passing out the Government i·ecogniz<'cl this valuable servant o:f the people by giving him retii·e~ ment pav at the rate o:f $720 per annum.for the balance of his life. J,\.nyone '.can see at a glanc~ that his salary during his active service was so ·small. that it was ..J?ractically jmpossible for him to sa,_·e nnythi11g, and, so just· in thls: case the two striking unjust elen1entf? ~hat stand. out in our pref'ent retirement law are these: Mr. Fischer _durin.g _Ns ~01ine~ti911 _with .the Go~·ermn~nt, th~ougl~ his ,irigenpity aud inventffe mmd, contributed . mstruments to the- Gov~rnment that :from n commN·cial basis alone benefited· this 'country in many

. ways to the extent of many hundreds of thousands of dollars, for which no recognition was ever given to him; and the other. outstanding point is that his retirement should not have been based on an average sum fixed for all, but on a basis of what he had enrned in active service, that would assure him of a comfortable living during the remainder of his days, as well as a recognition for unusual public service. · As I stated above, there are many other cases similar to Mr. Fischer's where underpaid employees have saved the country thoufiands of dollars, and it is hoJ?ed. that at an early date legislation will be enncted whereby a fairer basis of retirement pay can be given to nll the civil employees of the Government.
'EFFECTIVI~ Dl8TJUB'C?l'IO!ll' 01' D.\TA Rl~SULTl~G FHO:U SUR\"EYR )lADE BY THE

BURJ·:AF

Three years ago a plan was inaugurated in this burean . of placing more readily at the disposal of county surveyors, land surveyors, city engineers, and other civil engineers the data resulting from surveys mn:de by this bureau. This plan had its inception in the realization that. in making surveys for the establishment of arcs of triangulation and precise level nets across the country to provide, geographic J?OSitions and elevation be~1ch marks primarily for controls m mnppmg the counh·y the resultmg data would. be of immense practical use to those engaged in making local surveys or in other engineering work iri areas covered by the oontrol surveys. Some investigation was made before the plan whs attempted and this investigation disclosed that many local engineering projects were being undertalrnn 'vithin the areas covered by these control surveys without .knowledge of the existence o:f the control surveys, and thus at considerable extra cost in providing controls and elerntions for the local projects. The publications Of this bureau containing the results of the national surveys were compiled with the purpose of placing the in~ormation in· thmn in shape thnt would be readily availabfo for nrnp-mnking organizations operating on n large scale and covering large areas of tlw. country. The data. they contained · were not indexed by the smalle1· subdivisions of the country. To make these data avaj}nble for county surveyors, city engineers, and others interested generally in making surveys of smaller proportions, it was apparent that the. classes of information necessary :for use in making local surveys must he segregated from those neceSSt_ll'Y for map making on a lnrge seal<', and that some means of showmg quickly what a're ava.ilable in a small nrea must he devised. This \vas accomplished by undertaking to make a digest oi. the publications of .this bu~·eau for each Sta~. This digest contains a. base map of the State for which made, which shows graphically the kind.s of work done in the State and what areas are covered. See illustration No. 1 opposite, showing what has been done in the State of Texas. The <.l1gest contains an alphabetical a11.·angement of the counties in the State and an index of the places in each coun~y where. reforence marks have been established. A digest .has been prepared and published for pach of the following States: Alabama, Arkansas, Colo-

Hydrographic surveys off our coasts require seaworthy vessels. a number of years the survey was forced to use old and· weak vessels: and during that period the operations were confined, in a large measure, to sheltered waters or close to good harbors. As .stated in my previous reports, during the last few years :four adequate vessels have been acquired, namely, the Sw·veyor, Discoverer, <Jwide, and Pionee1'. The former was built for the bureirn in HH7, but as it was soon a.fter assigned to war service it was not engaged in surveying work until 1919. The latter three vessels were Navy mine sweepers, which upon transfer to the sm·vey were altered for their work and placed in service in 1922 and 1923. , These vessels are capable of withstanding all stresses of weather which they may encounter in the regions 0£ their work on the Pacific coast and in Alaska. They are completely fitted with such appa·ratus as has been found by long experience to be best adapted for the examination of those areas. The Swrveyor carries three special-type hydrographic launches for work close inshore in the numerous indentations of the southeastern .Alaska coast line. The Guide is equipped with a depth finder for sounding by the sonic method and a radio acoustic sound ranger for the determmation of the vessel's position while sounding. The latter apparatus is especially valuable on the California and Oregon coasts on accou:r;it of the large percentage of weather of low visibility. All the vessels are furnished with electric sounding machines and carry several open boats :fully equipped for work by detached parties. Burning fuel oil, the supply and storage' of fuel for a large steaming radius is entirely solved. Their size permits accommodations for a large officer and crew personnel to caITy on the various classes of work necessary in completely surveying a given section. The value of modern, adequately equipped surveying vessels such as these is reflected in the volume and completeness of the data. collected by them during the past year.

SPECIAL SUl?VEYS REQUES'l'l:D FOR MILITARY AND OTHER PURPOSES

The demands upon this bureau for special surveys for the military arms of the Government are steadily increasing, and during the past year thes1;1 surveys have constituted no small part of the field work. Mention was made in my last annual report of special surveys re~ quested by the Secretary of the NaYy on which the bureau was engaged during that year. Most of these surveys were completed dU:r~ ing the period covered by this annual report, but some of the work "till extend over into the next fiscal year. To those surveys hav~ been added several more for which requests were receiYed this year. Some of these surveys are strictly of a military nature and are for the construction of defense maps or for the efficient location of

<l.cfense works, and consequently are confidential. Others are not :strictly of a military nature, but are for the convenient and safe operation of naval vessels in ·waters little. used by conunercial vessels -or for the. mapping and description of military reservations or the location of cables and the like. Requests for the early survey of -certain heretofore unsurveyed a11eas ·do not place any particular additional burden upon ;the ·bureau, 'hl1t rather cause a rearrange. ment of the bureau's 'Surveying p:lans so :as to give precedence to the -survey of those areas. [n other cases, however, the work desired by the military ·a:uthoriti~s is ·such as would not be done by this bureau unless s,pemally requested. ·Some of this work is a little out of ·the line of the usual activities of the bureau, but such as the engineering personnel of ·the :bureau is equipped .to handle. The wire-drag survey ·of Vieques :sound, requested by the Navy some years ago, was completed early in this fiscal yea:r, and the party -engaged upon that woi:'kfook up the survey -0£ the waters of the Virgin Islands; The latter survey is not strictly for military operations, but in the matter of detailed hyd:rography and wir~-sweeping operations this survey ·has been extended far ·beyond the needs of the mer-chant marine in order to safeguard naval vessels which may, ii.n connection with annual maneuvers, have. occasion to enter those waters which a're as· yet of little importnnce ·to coinmeree. · ·. · A cadustral survey was made of the naval reservation .on :Culebra Island for the purpose Of ,fixing and describing -thC>: bounds of .the Government's property. 'l'b.is survey was performed by Coast .Survey personnel and financed by the Nary Department. · · · In Alaska one-of·the largest survey vessels was employed through-out the. flscal year on a: special survey for the N a-vy, It ·is iexpectcd this work will be completed 'in the fnll of 1924. · · · ·· · At t~e request. o:f the ·Signal O~rps ·of 'tI~e Airmy the ·.bu.reau <!Mp~ (lrated m the laymg <>f the ·new m1htairy C'aible to lretc'lnkan, Alaska. Fortunately, the waters through which ltbe cable ·must .'I.'> ass in entering. from the, Paci~c Ocean had been. surveyed recently nn~ for that part o:f the ·work -it was irncessary ·on1y to select f.rom the data ·on file in this office the most suitable locati-071 for 'the ·cable;· There was one section :pf't11e~cabfo; however, which fuust be laid 'through unsurveyed :waters, a:n,d ·at the request of the W O:r Department a vessel was fa'ken off 'of her regular work ·and' sent into tbose wa.ters in advance ~:f -tlie cable ship. · The survey was completed in time to supply the mastel' of the ca:ble ship with sufficient data to enable him· to safely lay the caple. In this connection the Secretary of War stated: "The safe na.vigatiop of ihe ea.hie ship Dellwood of Twelve Mile Arm and Trocadero Bay could hardly have been successfully accomplished witbotit tbe nssistn·nce received from the Ef1Jplore1·." · · · In the Hawaiian Islands special work was performl.>d for both the Arn1y u.nd the Navy. The work de..sired by the Navy was performed under. the .direction of .n.n officer ·Of this bi.ll'eau, but with personnel, v~ls, and boats provided by the Navy. In the case of the survey ~or the War Department ~me of the personnel, the equipment, and trangportat10n were provided by the 'Var Department. The work was in cha.rge of a.n officer from the bureau but conducted in accordnnce with the wishes of the ·war Department. .

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR,. CO,AST AND GEODETIC SU~VEY ·PROGRESS IN ALASI{A .

Excellent progress in, Aiask11J1 surveys has been l).lude duri~g· ~fie past year and will depend in the future largely U,l)On prope~· equipment. It has been· fo11nd that a large, stanch slup; mothermg. several launche.s which are. self-sustaining for a· reasonable period Qf time and able to operate in the restric.ted 1md dangerous areas wh~i:e the ·ship can not go, makes a most effective and economical combination. The three large ships now employed on Alaskan surveys are all that the bureau can utilize efficiently at this time; but tliere is. a pressing need for launches of from. 60. to 70 foet .in length with accommodations sufficient :for.one or two detached parties. Two such launches could well be attached to each ship;;. At present,. there are not enough of these larger la.unche.s available for the assignment of even one to a ship, and in the near ftiture it ·will be necessary to condemn an<l dispose of two that are now old and dangerous. . . For a number of years this bureau has followed the policy of making its surveys contmuous., The value of continuity in survey opera~ tions -is illustrated by the surveys in southeastern Alaska, where work along the outside coast has boon extended northward from season to season and has shown marked progress. '\Vire-drag operations along the main ship channel routes have likewise b.een expedited by the same' policy. . . . .. ' . : ·:Wire-drag operations have been confine.d tothe commercially important bays adjacent to the steamship. lanes. previously .dragged. At the request of .the :We.1~ Department, a detailed,.survey and wire drag has been made. of Kasaan Bav and Twevle Mile Arm. This work was essential to t11e successful ~aying of the .Alaska cable, as stated in a letter to this bureau by the Secretary of V'{ ar .. The work on .the outside coast 0£ Alaska, has, as previously stu.ted, been continuous and now has reached a .point 25 miles north from Cape Omaney. This work not only includes the surveys of the shore line, bays, and inshore areas, but has been carried westward to the 1,000fathom curve, and in the course of the work many fishing banks have been a«eurately located. . ·. · The extension of the extremely important work in western Alaska, which could not be undertaken earlier, owing to.lack of equipment, has been made possible by the three vessels ·of the mine-sweeper type now in operation. Oue vessel, the Pioneer, has been engaged in continuous surveys in the vicinity of Morzhovoi and Cold Bavs llnd is progressing eastward. In addition a survey is being maae of the passage from the Pacific to the Bering Sea, generally known as False Pass, and at the end of the fiscal year the shallow Bering Sea entrance has been surveyed. The Discoverer has completed 'Wide and Jute Bays and extended the surveys at the entrance of Portage Bay. This project is of great importance, owing to the fact that the oil fields lie immediately behind and these .bays· are the normal outlet for this district. The survey of Castle Bay, locntcd at the entrance to Chignik Bay, has been completed and marks the beginning of the systematic surveys which will be Cttrried eastward progressively and Joined to already completed work.· .·

Along the Atlantic coast, 'hJ;drography, inclnclfog offshore wo1·k, was extended southward as far as Ormond, Fla., .and a hydrogrnphic survey was made in the vicinity of Cape Fear. The offshore work on this coast is no~v complete frmn Cape Fear on the Xdrth Carolina coast· tO the vicinity o'f Ormond on the Florida coi1st, wit.h the exception of n gap mi: tlw S6nth Carolina C'.JUSt nortln'\'arc1 from Winyah Bay, which is yet to be done. : · On the. Unlf coast tlH' snney of the approach to Sabine Pass was ('Orn l)]pted. A hycl1·o~mphic Slll'\'ey of. thP waters :rf t lw Virgin Islf,rnds was begun in this fiseul year and nt tlw cloSP. of the yrar was about hidf finished. · A survey of Lake Okeechobee, Fla., was lwgnn dnring the year. A triangufotioll' net of control stations has bc>en rxtendr'd entirely around the lake' and connected "·ith the Atlantic coast control by a high-grade geodetic traverse>. This will he followed Ly u topographic and a hydrogmphic snney. · A survey of Scituate Harbor, )fuss., an<l a resnney of Baltirnore Ha1·bol', l\fd., were in progress at. the close of the tiscal year und were neal'ly completed. ' ' On the Pacific coast offshore hydrographic smTeys wc>re accomplished northward of and extending nearly to Cape Blanco. On the southern California const offshore hydro¥rnphy was extended. northward from the work of last year to a pomt ahont halfway between San Diego and San Pedro. The passage of the sur\ey steamer G1liilc, the newest of the survey fleet, from the .Atlantic coast to her station on the P~cific coast was marked by a further extension of the ocean surveys mentioned in my last report. The track of the Guide was so laid that tlw soundings taken by this party supplemented the ocean work of the steamers Disco-vere-r, Pioneer, and Lydonw, and of the vessels which performed similar work in eadier years, so as to fill gaps and complete the oceun survey from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast via the Panama Canal. In the Philippine Islands the most important work of the year was the beginning of a hydrographic survey of the waters north of the island of Luzon. Because of the peculiar difficulties attending surveys in these localities and because of the relative unimportance of these waters from a commercial standpoint the survey of the north and northenst sides of Luzon and of the adjacent waters has been deferred until other mo1·e important parts of the arehipelago were surveyed. The beginning o~ th<:o work this year on the northern coast of Luzo~ marks the initial step in a pl'oject for the eompletion of the suney of the Philippine Archipelago. A marked accomplishment 0£ the bureau during the year was the introduction of acoustics in hydrographic surYeying. · Dming the Year the bureau perfected and adopted appliancc>s making use of the Velocity of sound for measuring distance both vertically and horizontally. The bureau is now not only measuring the depth of the ocean but is determining the exact position of each depth me.asurement by .means of apparatus whic,li records:the tlistancc:- in ~eruis 'of the velocity of sound waves through the water. ·

SURVEX" OF THE W.\TERS OF THE PIIII.IPPIXE ISLANPS NEARLY,l'INISHED

. During- the past year the.owners and operators of deep-sea ships of American and other registry have found it desirable to send their ships directly to hitherto unused ports of the Philippine Islands, and there lood the local export of sugar, hemp, and copra instead of loading only at such ports as Manila, Cebu, Iloilo, or Zamboanga. Previ" ously, it was necessary that the small intedsland vessels collect and carry to those ports all cargoes for overseas shipments. This departure has resulted in u reduction in freight costs and also has created ' a new demand for Philippine charts to insure the safety of these larger ships. · From the beginning of surveys by this bureau in 1900, the Federal and Insular Governments haYe cooperated in the work of chartinO' the Philippine Islands. At this time approximately 75 per cent o~ the origirnll suney has Leen completed and within this area ships may safely go. There remain, however, several areas where no reliable charts exist and for which but little information is available. (See fig. 2 opposite.) .. · These mismTeyed regions have had little or no development of their' resources, consequently they are lmimportant commercially, This fact 'increases the difficulty of surveying them.. Local bases for coal and supplies will ha:ve to be established to avoid long runs. North and northeast-0r11 Luzon present diffic9lties not found elsewhere. The long st1~tches of coast without harbors will compel the Vessels ope1;ating OU SlU'Yeys to put. to sea and ride OUt the storms that frequent this coast during the only season. ,of the year when may \1e done. Between storri1s the sea is sinooth and landing the beach easy. The wooded mountains which rise abruptly fro1i1 the coast are extremely unfuyorablc for the establishment of coastal control. ·western Pnlawan n.nd the Sulu Archipelago present much less difficulty; although a vast amom1t of hydrog~hy will be required in both of these areas properly to develop tlie many shoals kna wn to exist. . . · , The objective of this bureau has bee1i the completion of the orig~ inal surveys of the entire group and practically all of its efforts, lin;llted by the. ships and equipment .a''.~ilable, have been and will oontinue to be directed to this end'. Any plans for keeping the char~ '4P ·tO dat~ after the completion of the original suflveys may well b,~ left for later considerati-Oll. ,

The eastern section of the boundary triangulation assigned to the United States, extending from Lake of the Woods to Lake Su· perior will be almost, if not quite, finished during the field season of 1924. Slower progress was made on the western end in northern Montana, dne largely to the yery short working season. ln southeast Alaska a party was engaged at the end of the fiscal ye!lr in connecting across Dixon Entrance the Canadinn triangulation to that already executed by this burenu, thus completing one of the longest belts of precise triangulation in the world, reaching from San Diego, Calif., to near the head of Lynn Canal, Alaska, thou~h two or three bases still remain to be ·measured near its northern ena. The cooperation of this bureau with the Geodetic Survey of Canada on these major- projects hns sawd each nation a large amount of money, since ench benefits by the work done by the other. Besides these ma.jor projects seveml minor ones have been prosecuted or completed. Reobservation of the old triangulation ii1 California. hns shown movements of the enrth's surface of such magnitud~ tha.t they become of prime importance not only to scientists but also to the entire population of thnt region, presaging as they do the possibility of predicting the localities which are in greatest danger from earthquake shocks. The geodetic location of two boundaries was completed, and 800 miles of precise levels were run in various portions of the country. A complete list of field projects is given on pages 53- and 54 of this report.

The prime pmpose of the magnetic survey of· the United. States [ nnd i·cgions under its jurisdiction and the waters adjoining them is to fm;nish jnfonnation which makes it possible to place correct compass rose's l.m the charts. The mariner considers the compass rose. which shows him how to lay off a ('OrrC'ct magnetic course, as one QT the most important features of the chart. Determinations of· the ) earth"s mngnetisrn are made bot.h along the coasts and some distance into the interior to accomplish this result. The further ·extension of the magnetic work to the interior of the l:'nited States , has had very practicable and Y11l11able results. · One of the most { striking results is brought out by the recent' successful around-theworld cruise of the Army Air Service planes. These airpltrnes \1 :were equipped "·ith mugnetic compasses of the earth inductor type. 'l'his bureall during the last year furnished magnetic information ) for the new aviation map of the United States. County and local surveyors are making constant use of the magnetic information supplied by this bureau to l'enm old lines and also ·to make new sun-eys in forest lands und other places where precise methods nre not called for. . '~'o render the results of magnetic obsenntions of continued value, fin' observatories nre kept in constant operation, so placed that they con1· the region from Porto Rico to Hawaii and from Arizona t'o Alaska. These observatories, together with repeat observations at regular intenuls at a number of po~nts throughout the United StutPs, form the source of our knowledge of the continuous chang-es in the earth's ma~netism. The results of. observations at these obsernttoriPs nre bemg furnished to organizations interested in cable and radio .transmission in their study of various forms of interference with the reception of signals.

YAIXE OF 'l'H:t; SAN J>nANCISCO HAimon C:lJllRENT AND TIDE St;R\'EY

For a number of years, owing to insufficient funds for detailed. current and tide surveys, it has been necessary for this bureau to make predictions of the future state of the current in the various harbors for the use of the mariner :from meager instrumental observations. Obviously, the results could only be approximate since the prediction of currents is very complex even with a consid-· erable amount of data upon which to base conclusions and .from which to prepare constants' for these advance predictions. . Congress realized the value to the mariner of the accurate adv;ance· knowledge of the state of the current in our important harbors, and for the fiscal yea1· 1922 appropriated $15,000 to cover the cost of a current and tide survey of New York Harbor. The following year a like amount was appropriated for a similar survey of San Francisco Harbor. The latter survey wns made dul"ing the fiscal year 1924, and definite knowledge of the tide and current phenomena for that harbor is now available. To the navigator the current tables issued by this surve)' are of invaluable aid, since they inform him in advance of the time of slack water and the time and velocity of the strength or current-the first of considerable importance in the berthing of large vessels; the second, in keeping account of the position of the vessel in thick weather. · . · Aside from the importance of the survey to the mariner, the byproducts which are obtained a.t no increased cost are of importance to the engineer engaged in harbor improvement (both of a civil and a military nature), or in wharf construction, etc., who cnn undertake his work with a better k~dwledge of the current and· tide conditions under which the operations wm be carried on. The data from the survey·of New York Harbor have been computed and the results interpreted and discussed. The manuscript of a publication covering in detail the tide and current phenomenll of ea.Ch section of the harbor is now in· press. The .data from the San Francisco survey are now being computed and, after being correlated' with the ~various scattered observations made at different .times 'in previous years, the conclusions will be issued in ·a publicn.· · · .. · tfon similar to that for New York Harbor.

The progress of. this bureau as a whole is directly related to ·its adYancement in the development' of its instruments, as they are

t'he tools with which the '.basic work is performed. Stagnation in such development, or neglect. to make use of the most modern. and efficient eqmpment and materials, would be immediately reflected. in the efficiency of the bureau' . .·. . · 'Constant work is carried on in improving the existing apparatus. and in developing new instruments to meet the survey's ever-mcreasing requirements, making use of new materials and methods which" render the equipment more efficient and durable and reduce the cost of field operations. Such work often involves prolonged scientific investigations regarding the properties of metals and alloys, magnetism, electricity,. light, gravitation, etc., and the result of such researches has made possible the development of instruments of precision whose accuracy has never been surpassed. Many of these instruments have been adopted by other governments. and are being. widely used by other branches of our own Government, municipalities, and private organizations. We are frequently in receipt of requests for information regarding the construction and procurement of our instrumeqts. and for the ·results of our investigations. The field activ:ities have been increased manyfold during the past two decades but no change has been made in the number of employees provided for instrument. development. The force is so· busily occapied with performing the current repairs to the instrument stock that work on new devices must perforce J?rogress but slowly ana the snrYey is now seriously he.mpered in this important branch of its work by lack of personnel. . . GEODETIO LEVELING, Ron.-A device was perfected which puts·the invar metal strip of the level rods under tension, thereby eliminating a slight error which was found to occur due to the sa~ging of the strip under its own weight. This is a comparatively simple device consisting chiefly of a spring bearing upon a shoulder at the top of: the strip. This device has proven to be very: effective. PORTABLE AuTOMA'l'IC TIDE GAUGEs.-During the past year a small portable tide gauge wus desi~ned l}nd built which differs rasfically from the portable gauge usea heretofore in that the train of gears and the screw traversing mechanism is reflaced by a direct-acting rack and gear, thereby eliminating severa possible sources. of lost motion and making a· somewhat less complicated gauge· to construct.· Several improvements were mad~ in the older type of portable· gauge which remov~d various sources of .friction and ~Ioggmg, and made :the gauge easier to operate· and ad3ust. These improvements eliminate practically all objectionable features of construction of this gauge and it has given satisfactory records throughout the year. AUTOMATIC LIGHTING DEVICE FOR S:mNAL LAM:Ps.-A small switch was designed for use in conjunction with· a standard type o~ clock for the purpose of lig-hting signal lamps. This switch, which weighs less than 2 ounces, is of simple and. rugged construction. and is so designed that the current fr0m a. small battery will light the lamp· for any desired period of time after setting the switch. The mechanism is entirely automatic and will cause the lamp to burn for a given number of hours, beginning at any predetermmed time, over a period of one week without attention. A number of these lighters have been used during the present season and ha.v&

given excellent results, u.re much lighter, less expensive, and more reliable than the devices used for this purpose heretofore. RADIO AcousTIC RANGE FINDEn.-Work with the radio acoustic range finder was continued and a simple and inexpensive bomb was designed by this bureau after a series of tests were conducted, using various types of bombs and exploders under varying conditions. The bomb as finally designed consists of a commercial type of tin can loaded with trinitrotoluol to which a standard form of exploding device has been attached. This bomb has functioned satisfactorily in the £eld and has been an important factor in the success of the radio acoustic work. ELECTUIC SouNDING l\iAcHrn:i-:.-Two types of electrically operated sounding machines were designed and built during the year, and the larger of these has been put into operation. The results so ~ar indica~~ ,th11-t. it. is gre.,aHY, s.~p~rior to the form~r ty~es of sounding machine; It is of ·srmple and rugged construction, and the electric-motor drive gives it a smoothness of operation which not only increases the speed, permitting a greater number of soundings to be taken in a given time, but allows the ship to be run at higher speed. A vessel equipped ·with this type of niachine will be able to obtain sounding data over a. considerably greater area during the season. A marlrnd. reduction in breakage of the sounding wire has also been noted, evidently .due' to 'the steadiness with which the. sounder ope~ates. A similar: bu'~ smaller tyJ?e of sounding machine ~1as been designed for o:perat10n m comparatively shallow water and will be to this type of work what the larger machine is to th~ greater depths. DrvIDING l\fACIIIX:E.-A machine has been designed and partially built for the purpose of applying· the a~curately spaced checker work painting to the Geodetic level rods. This work was formerly done by hand and was a slow and laborious process and it has beeri i~J?OSsible to obtain by h.a~d. metl~ods. ~he desired .accuracy ~f. div1s10n or sharpness of d1v1dmg hries. The machme as designed wholly eliniinates the necessity or accurate, hand work. It will space the cl~ecker work with an accuracy in ·exce8s of that which is necessary and the actual painting is done by mechanical m·eans. It is esti:mated that this machine will reduce the tini.e required to paint u rod by 75 per cent. ·

CHAPTER I
NEW BUILDING f':l·EEDED

Much has been said in my past annual reports regarding the handicap under which the bureau is operating ii) its present quarters an.d the extent to which production o:f nautical charts is retarded, due to the utter impossibility o:f organizing prod11ction units so that the maximum results or results that ought reasonably to be expected shall he attained. This is due to the fact that the bureau is housed in a group of eight buildings, more or less detached from each other, each, with the exception of one, built for purposes other than the housing of this b11rea11 and not at all adapted to th11 efficient 11se of the burenu. The subject has been discussed so thoroughly in the various annual reports that there is little additional to offer except to urge that the importance of the matter shall have the consideration it merits by the l~gislative. b~ancl~ of t~e Governmer_i.f and that steps l;le taken to provide a bmldmg m which the maxurtum of production can be · realized at. the mimmum of cost per unit.,.

CHAPTER II
NEW VESSELS NEEDED
PACIFIC COAST

,

.As rirnntioned previously in this report, the survey is fortunate 111 l1aving four modern surveying vessels adequate for the extension of surveys offshore and in the more remote waters of Alaska. It would be ex'tremely hazardous, however, to permit these large vessels to attempt the surveying required close to shore. Therefore, tenders nre assigned to them for the particular work of sounding in shoal m·eas alongshore and among submerged reefs. These tenders occasionally strike uncharted rocks in the ·course of thC'ir work. which, if encountered by the vessels, might result in a total loss of these expensive units. The ·damage to the tenders, however, is unimportant, and their sbr.e permits repairs to be made on the working grounds. · For example, the Oos11to8 has on numerous occasions been stranded on nnknown reefs, submerged by rising tide, raised, repaired, and . replaced in service by the party to continue work in the same section for the remainder of the season. . On account. of the hazard in which these tenders have been forced to operatP, thefr condition at the present time is extremely poor. Three of them lrnve been in service in Alaska for over 20 years. Considering their age, it is ren1arkable that they have been able to remain in service during the past year. This has been possible only by limiting them to work in favorable weather, as they could not survive in heavy seas. Consequently, their original usefulness is gone. 'Vithout these nnits the large vessels are operated ut a serious dis· advantage. If open boats must he used to do their work, the vessel inust halt other work to stand by them. Moreover, only the most favoraLle weather conditions would permit the t1se of small open boats on such work. It can therefore be seen that unless these tei;iders ·are rep_laced. by similar vessels their work must be accomplished jn an meffic1ent manner. For these reasons the need :for new tenders is most appnrent and is without question the· most vital need in the matter -0f new equipment for the prosecution of ~urveys along the Alaskan coast. .
ATLANTIC COAST

. On the Atlantic coast the Bache, a vessel 23 years old, reached the condition some years ago where her annual cost of repairs and upl~eep amounted to a sum out of proportion to the .original invest· n1ent ·in the vessel and made her a liability. She may continue to

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

operate with considerable repairs :for some time longer, but only in comparatively smooth water. There is needed to replace this vessel a new one of about 600 tons displacement. The Hydrographer, a vessel 24 years ol<l, is in the same predicament as the Bache, and she should be replaced as soon as possible. Efforts are being directed to meet the increasing demand for lurgescale charts of those inland waterways traversed by motor boats. At the present time large launches are used which base upon cities adjacent to these waterways. As the work progresses, however, these bases will become less accessible and time will be lost from field work by the necessity :for long runs :for fuel and supplies. For the purpose of connecting these surveys there should be constructed a shallow-draft, self-propelled boat provide<l with .quarters :for smveying personnel, storage :for fuel, and repair equipment for maintaming several launches.
DEllIA:SDS FOR HYDHOGRAPllIC WORIC

· There is an increasing demand for hydrographic work, and the accuracy of the chart of to-day is more essential than ever for safe. navigat10n of the large a.nd expensivPi modern vessels. · In 1885 one of the lar~est. vessels afloat was the sailing ship Great Republic, of approximately 3,3o7 tons and carrying a cre"of 65 men. On her maiden voyage to London there was no dock at tJ;e port large enough for this vessel. Comparing her with the LevuLthan of to-day, 0£ 59,956 gross tons and currymg a crew of 1,200 men, will give some idea of the great development of oceangoing vessels. A chart adequate for the safe navigation of the Great Republi<J would no more meet the requirements of the Leviatharn than the original surveys of New York City made with inferior instruments when property values "ivere low would meet the requirements of to-day. · The great development in the size and rnlue of shipping, together with the development of modern navigational instruments, necessitates that the old hydrographic surveys be supplemented by additional work, and that sea areas :formerly unimportant be thoroughly developed. The advent of the submarine has necessitated that .the chart shall be adequate to protect subsurface navigation. During the last year two new instruments have been successfully used by this bureau in hydrographiQ surveying-radio acoustic method of position determination and the sonic depth finder. The hydrographer's duty is not only the determination of depth but also the actual location of that depth. The first-named instrument is used :for the determination of the position of the sounding and its use has made it feasible to do hydrographic work in :foggy and misty weather where heretofore it. has been impossible to work owing to the necessity of seeing signals. The second instrument has been successfully used in the determination of depths and has the great advantage of being· able to make frequent SQundings without stopping the vessel', as has heretofore been necessary in dee.I? water. Instruments for the measurement of depth by ·the some method are being devised in this and :foreign countries by governmental

and private agencies, ·and such instruments will most likely be used in nnvigation. The use of these instruments on nissels will greatly increase the importance of the .chart to the na ,·igator and will neces~itate additional hydi,ographic work to thoroughly de,·elop the bottom so all characteristic submerged ,-alleys, ridges, etc., may be shown on the chart in their correct positions. A Yessel equipped with such instruments will be able to get many soundings during a 1ninute and by having charts showing n9t only the depth, but the n-ccnrate location of different characteristic :features of the bottom. the navigator can locate the Yessel by comparin~ the soundings ob~ tained with the information shown on a correct chart.

The importance of completing the drag work along the Kew Eng1a11d coast, where the existence of bowlder and pinnacle rockf' is most ·often not indicated by soundings taken with a lead line, hos been stressed h1 previous annual reports. During the first part of this .Yeal' appropriations warranted doing some of this work and the area. along the ont.side coast from Portland south to Biddeford, Me., was .completed by a wire-drag party, It will be impossible, owing to lack of approp1;iutions, to continue this very important wol'k during this fisl'Hl year.

Jil'DROORAPllY, A'il'LAXTIC COAST

. Th~ important work along the Atlantic coast necessary to the protection of shipping is a resurvey of certain changeable areas and 1111 ·extension of the work to the 100-fathom curve. Vessels in transAtlantic yoyages and approad1ing this coast are often m1cl.'rtai11 of their positions and the detailed information furnished by a surrey -extending to the 100-fathom curve is especially important to the navigators o:f these· vessels and, as mentioned befon', will he cspe· ·cially important when the sonic method for measmin~ depths is <'ommonlv used on vessels. The most urgent areas of tlus chnrricter are from 'Winyah Bay north to Chesapeake Bny <'lltrnncc nnd sout.hwnrd from the completed work in the Yicinity of Orm.and Beach, Fln., to Cape Canaveral. . . . The Lydonia, one of our ocean-going vesse)s has been currying on thif;l work dnring the entire fiscal year, working in the Yicinity of Cnpe Fear Ri \ er dul'ing the summer months. nnd southward along the Florida coast during the winter months when it is impossible to <.:al'l'y on economical work farther north. During the latter part of the fiscal year the Ba~llc, together with the launch El.~ia, has been -engaged in the inshore surveys along the coast from St. Augustine, Flu .. northward and will continue this work during this fiscal yea1· northward to 'Vinyah Bay. Most of the work upon which this party is engaged is over' changeable areas and includes the development o'f the bars and entrances to ports along the coast.

It is hoped to complete this work during the next fiscal year.
HYDl!OORAl'HY,,PACU'IC COAST

In marked contrast to the work along the Atlantic coast, which previously has been surveyed, comparatively little work has bPen accomplished along the Pacific coast, and the surveys being executed by this bnrean are in most cases original surveys. "Tith the. addition of the three seagoing vessels of the mine-sweeper class, mentioned in my previous reports, it has been possible to keep one of these vessels, the Guide, continuously engaged on surveys of the west coast, working in the winter months along the southern California coast and in th<' summer months alo~ the coast of northern California and Oreg-on in the vicinity of vape Blanco, which is a very important turning point for all coasting vessels, and where previously only a Yery few scattering soundings were charted. This vessel is equipped with the sonic depth finder and has established stations for the radio acoustic method of position finding, both of which methods hnw added materially to the output of the party.

A stupendous task confronts the bureau in charting- the coasts of western Alaska, comparatively little of which has yet been suneyed. Owing to the lack of adequate equipment, it \Yas impossible for a number of years to do work in this area, but with the addition of the three mine sweepers it has been possible to assign two of themthe Discoverer and Pioneer-to this task. Each of. these Yessels has one additional lar·ge launch to work·in conjunetion with the ship along ·this ·dangerous and treacherous coast. ·work was accomplished last year by the party on the steamer Pionee1· in the ,·icinity of Morzhovoi and Cold Bays, and the work is to be continued this fiscal yea.r, including Pavlof and Ikatan Bays and Isanotski Strait, and the approaches to these areas. The Di~ooverer \Vas engaged on Sltrveys on the southern coast o:f the Alaska Peninsula in the Yicinity of Portage Bay, Shelikof Straits, where important oil fields have been developed. The work in this vicinity will be completed this year .and the party will take up the surveys of Chi~ik Buy and its approaches. If possible, the 100-foot motor vessel Natoma. will take up urgently needed additional work in Prince 'Yilliam Sound during this fisca_l year. . .

Considerable work remains to be done 'in these islands, the importance of which has been called to the attention of the bureau by numerous requests for suneys from other Government departments, commercial firms, and indi,,iduals. In addition to the work in the vicinity of the larger group of islands, there is need for the examination and correct charting ·of islands and shoals extending westward to the Midway Islands. One shore party has been engaged during the fiscal year in executing work in these islands and will be continued on this work during the next fiscal year.

SURVEYS

Committees of Congr<'SS and special committees of other organizations haw spent a Yast amount of 'time in investigating the overlapping of functions and duties in the various Government bureaus. Their recommendations have in some instances resulted h1. actuar or contemplated improvements, yet at the same time a most important economic corollory is being lost sight of. · From the standpoint of efficiency n concentration of duties of a similar character in a single bureau must be followed by a granting of the means of performing that function. The Coast and Geodetic Survey is charged with the duty of furnishing accurate elevations lind geographical positions for other mapping agencies as well as for its own charts in order to avoid the duplication of expensive instrumental equipment and specialized personnel. The appropriation for such work remains· woefully inadequate· for the needs of all agencies concerned. A few of the results of this policy will be briefly pointed out, so far as they affect other bureaus and the public interests which they serve. PUBLIC RoADs.-At first glance there appears to· be little connection between road construction and the latitudes and longitudes of points, or their elevation above sea level. Yet construction must be

preceded ·by locatfon ·surveys; ;and preliniin11ry location surveys can, most. cases, be' avoided altogether where modern topographic maps are avnilable: · . Satisfactory top~aphic maps can be based only. upon data"supplied by. preci~e triangulation or .traverse and leveling: The savuigs to the nation's road-construction program alone would, in a few years, pay for the completion of the topo" graphic tnap together with its basic control sl).rveys. . . GENERAL LAND 0FFICE.-Connecting the monuments of the public ~and surveys to the general triangulation scheme of the· country insures the permanency of property surveys. If the latitude and longitude of a section corner· are ol'lce known· accurately, it can always be exactly relocated by triangulation. Cadastral engineers of the General Land Office cooperate with the field parties of the survey in tying together the two great survey systems of the country. In Alaska there is · even more urgent need by the General Land Office for precise triangulation surveys, to remove the necessity of a large number of local land survey systems, each with its own reference meridian and parallel, for when such local cadastral sur'Vey systems join there are unavoidable gaps and overlaps of large extent. Dur111g the past three summers a party of this survey has extended a system of precise triangulation from Cook Inlet to the Tanana Valley, but the smallness of the.appropriation for such work will necessitate the removal bf even that party during the summer of 1925, although the economic demands of that region would warrant the maintenance of at least two parties for a number of years. Foru:sT SERVIOE.-One of the chief ·sources 0£ revenue of the Forest Service arises from its grazing permits. To administer them and to lay out the necessary roads and trails, the reserves must be mapped. In the absence of a standard topographic map it carries on extensive mapping operations. Many large forests are lacking in adequate control surveys upon which such maps can be bas~d. Year. after yet\r requests have been madP npon thi.:; lmrC'att i'or triangulation data iu forest reserves which have not been supplied because of lack of funds. · GEoLoGICAL SURVEY.-Upon the topographic branch of the Geological Surve'y devolves the duty of making the standard topographic map Of the couritry and as such it is by far the largest user of geodetic data. Specifications adopted by the 'Federal Board of Sur'\·eys and Maps prescribe that precise triangulation stations and precis.e level bench marks shall be so distributed that no part of an area to be mapped. shall be more than 50 miles from such a point. Yet there are ·three areas in the United States proper, each exceeding ~00,000 squnre miles, without a single pr~cise ~riangulation. station m them,. and one area 0£ 265,000 square imles without a precise level be'nch mark in it. Manv smaller areas are so deficient in control stirv~y~ that any extensive mapping operation in them is practically · · proh1b1ted. · WHEUE DurLWATION ExrsTS.-To sum up, the real duplication hes in many organizations, both Federal and private, making partial surveys in a region, each of which is adequate for only one particular pu_rpose, where.as a standard topographic map would suffice for all. The early. completion of the standard topographic map is an economic necessity recognized and urged by many great mterests

throughout the country. The mapping can not be done with even approximate accuracy without precise control· surveys. It can not be done economically unless the scheme of control surveys is completed in advance of the topographic mapping. These control surveys are years behind even the present demands of the topographic mapping program, and their acceleration should by no means be further delayed. They are the foundation of the. map structure of the Sation and can not be neglected just because they do not show on the printed map. .
CHAU'rING OUR COAS'l'AL WA'l'ERW.AYS

My annual report for 1923 stressed the growing importance of the motor-boat traffic through the sheltered inside waters which fringe our Atlantic coast from New York to Key West. These waters constitute a highway for a large and constantly increasing volume. of traffic, for fishermen and oystermen, for freight carriers serving a vast adjacent territory to which other adequate transportation facilities are not yet available., and for motor~boat men, who find in cruising these waters renewed vigor with which to meet the rigorous exactments of modern life. . .
COAS'l' i·:HOSIOX A:SD J>ROTECTION

The problem of the protection of our coasts from the unrelenting attacks of the waves and currents is one that is rapidly° increasing in importance to the States and municipalities that border uur Atlantic and Gulf seacoasts.. . The many requests that have recently come into this office regardjng- the condition of our shores, the demands that are constantly bemg, made for new surveys in changmg areas have served to emphasize the justification for pioneering in this Aeld of work. To the lay observer the meeting place of land and .sea is but a fascinating playgro11rnl whose elenw11ts are unchanging in their relation to each other. Little does he know of the pent-qp .forces that every incoming ·wave carries with it, to be released on its relentless work of destruction. · · ... · The physiographer and engineer, on the other hand, fully apJ?l'e7 ciate the impress left by every wind and wave that beat agamst an exposed shore. They see in this. meeting place not a playground but a battlefield where. land and sea are constantly strug~ling ·for supremacy and where too often the sea has been the victor. n is to them that we must ultimately look for a solution .to the intricate and perplexing problems of coastal evolution. . . .

serving their water fronts. Their first step in the direction of checking the destructive work of the sea will be to appeal to th.is · hnrenu for' information regarding the successive changes that their I'>nrticulnr portion of the coast has undergone. "\Ve can be in a position to furnish such information only by anticipating this futme development. The broad scope of the work, the need for a proper coordi~1ation of the many sources of information, the necessity of studying the ~ffects of similar conditions on different localities, all make it impernti,·e that the work be lodged in some central agency. Aud the1·e 1s no organization in this country to-day that is better fitted to undertake this far-reaching problem than the Coast and Geodetic Sur\'E'V. This bureau, through its corps of highly trained engineers an(l c1uto~raphers, is in a··position to make invaluable contributions to the study ·of the protect10n of exposed shore lines with but slight ttddition11l expenditures. First aud foremost in the study of coast erosion and protection we !'equire a series of adequate snrveys showing changing conditions over a long period of years. From these observations, combined with dMa regarding weather, currents, shore forms and materit1ls, a detailed study of the fiuctuutions·can be made and the 111ws governing shoreline changes deduced. ·with these laws definitely es~ tablished the engineer would be in u position to apply them to th~ particular project under consideration. For this purpose a comprehensive study should be made of the entire eroduble shore 'along tht> Atlantic and Gulf coasts irom existing surYeys, supplemented liy ndditionnl surveys from time to time where changes are fre11uenti as in· the various inlets that: connect. the successiYe bays and sonnds with the ocean. . . · · ·There 11re at present but few places along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts ,~·here periodic sm·yeys have been made. In many instances but one survey existS; and in other places two surveys comprise the entire number made .jiJ. the last 100 years, a condition wholly inadeqnate for satisfactory study. ·

The charts issued by the survey have on them nbont 2.000 compass roses, each of which shows the present direction of magnetic norlh with regard to true north for the point indicated, and the annual rate of change. in the direction. Every year 300 of these are fur· nished for new editions of the charts or .for new charts. It is therefore of great importance that magnctiC surrnys on which this information is based should be continuously in progress nnd, necessarily, coYer n very great area. There are in the United States 3,06j conn.ties, and in a very 111rge number of these counties the county and other local surveyors are called upon to make magnetic surveys or to rr:·trace old lines of which tlie. magnetic bearing at some date is known. Practically the only relinble source of information for these surveys und for cori·ecting tl1e instruments with which they are made is the .lllagnet.ic survey o~ the United States made by this bureau. The survey made for this purpose also served to meet the recent demand for magnetic information for use in aviation charts.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC, SURVEY

The around-the-world cruise, carried out by the planes of the Army Air Service, emphasizes a new use for our knowledge of terrestrial magnetism. These planes were ·equipped with earth inductor compasses and, accordingly, knowledge of the dip as well as. of the declination was of use. The results of the magnetic work of the bureau are thus used on earth, air, and sea. The collection of the needed information for the United States hus been carried on for many years and intensively during the lust 25 years. Information is now available for all parts of the Unit<.>d States and the regions under its jurisdiction. As the earth's magnetism is constantly changing, it is necessary to make observation,,; to record the changes. Observations are made at five fixed observatories and at numerous points or stations. Records of these chang0s are made by continuous photographing of the position of the delicately suspended needle{>. These observations have to be made in isolated places, as there must be no electric railway, electric powl'r, telegraph or telephone lines, nor ·iron or steel in any structure in thcit· vicinit,v. Acco~·dingly, the observer must live in seclusion and suffer many mconvemences. Any suspension, even though tempornry, of the work at any of the observatories is a serious matter. Accordingly, as the expiration of the lease of the land occupied by the observatory on Vieques Island, P. R., will expire on June 30, 1925, every effort is being made to replace it without undue delay with an observatory on the main island of Porto Rico. The willingness that has been shown by the present governor to cooperate is gomg to make it possible to start the erection of the necessary buildings during the present fiscal year. It is hoped that a site on public land will be obtained, so that future interference with the work by the expiration of a lease can be avoided_ Not only are the results at this observatory essentially needed for the charts :for those regions, because o:f the exceptionally rapid change in the direction of the earth's magnetism, but scientists consider that an observatory in this region gives exceptionally valuable results fot· a study of the earth's magnetism. The limited appropriations make it especially difficult to carry out this project in an adequate matml'r. It is most desirable that the atmospheric electricity work which was formerly carried on at Cheltenham magnetic observatory be taken up again as soon as practicable. This is an essential part of terrestrml magnetism, and more know ledge is necessary in regard to it before the problem o:f terrestrial magnetism can be solved. This work has a most important bearin~ on the discovery of the causes of certain difficulties in radio transmission. The general program of field work in the United Sta~s includl's the regular occupation at five-year intervals of about 200 stations throughout the country in order to determine the changes in the earth's magnetism. Additional stations are needed, especially in the ·western ]\fountain States, as they are at present too far apai·t to give adequate lmowledgl'. Wl1ile the surveys along the coasts nre :fairly complete, a much closer survey than has been made heri>.tofore is needed along the entire coast. This has been carried on during the past ·season along the coast of southern California with very satisfactory results. Another urgent need is the . replacement of magnetic Htations at county seats throughout the country. These are

r.Ei:ORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

25:

utilized by county surveyors who use magnetic instruments in test-· ing the correctness of their instruments. The ·conditions resulting from the growth o:f towns and cities :frequently eliminate or destroy the marks at these stations, so that the points of previous observations can not be found. In so far as it is found practicable· these stations 'Jt.re being replaced with others so located as to be secure :from fntllre disturbance wherever possible. One party in addition to those that it has been possible to operate in the past is urgently needed. · There is great need for a magnetic survey of Alaska especially in the interior and a.long the Aleutian Islands. M8.i:,onetic maps of Alaska. are based 011 insufficient data and the results at the Sitkn obserrntory, while invaluable, do not give the change :for the entire region. The completion of the Government railroad, availability ·Of power boats on the riYers, and other forms of transportation make tlw interior of Alaska more accessible. It is hoped that cooperation with the Coast Guard will make it possible to do magnetic work in the Aleutian Islands during the next fiscal year and at the same time to secure additional information. Magnetic data for Alaska are nowhere more than barely sufficient, and in many cases entirely insufficient for placing correct magnetic information on the mariner's chart. · The needed resurvey of the Philippine Islands will start during the next fiscal yea.i· and be carried on to completion. This will be made possible by the cooperation o:f the insular government. Repeat stations will also be occupied in the Hn,wa.iian Island~ It is hoped thnt the needed occupation of repeat stations in Porto Rico and on Vieques Island can be accomplished during the present year. · The work that is being accomplished is far from adequate to meet nll demands. The coastal nnd interior surveys are large projects and each wm require steady work for a long period. Many surveys which have been requested ha.ve been postponed indefinitely. A great deal is being accomplished with the funds available but they ha.ve been wholly inadequate for years to meet the demands of the public as they shonld be met. . .. ·
WHY sYSTE:lrATIC SEIS:ICOLOGICAL WORK IS NEEDED

·within the last three years earthquakes have been :felt. in 28 States and in Canada near the border; both under the sea off the coast of Oregoi1, and in·Porto Rico, Hawaiian Islands, the Philippines, and Alaska. Some of these caused more or less local damage. In this same region during historic times there have been at least eight major en1·thquakes which caused widespread damage and loss of life. Earthquake study is therefore important to the country ns a whole. The first real attack of this _pr~blem in the United .States is the im·estigation now going on in California, carried on hy the Carnegie Institution of 1'Ta:shington, with the cooperation of this and other GoYernment bureaus. This investigation is beginning fo give excellent J>romise of practical results, as well ns solving problems which are of interest to the seismologist. The part of this· bureau in this inn·stigntion hfi~ been the preeif.;(· dPtermination of ch:rnges in posi-

·

tion of triangulation stations, resulting either from earthquakes 01· from movements of the earth which result in earthquakes. An important part of the California investigation is the determination of the point of origin of the earthquake by instrumental methods, and this is being made possible and practica'.l by the development of i1ew and inexpensive instruments. . The purpose of this California work is not only a scientific stud~·· of earthquakes but also a very practical one of useful information to architects and engineers in regard to places where they must use special precautions in order to avoid the danger of catastrophe. The outstanding purpose is to make it possible to reduce loss of life and property in great earthquakes and eliminate it entirely in minor ones. The work in California standing alone is handicapped by the lack of investigation of n. similar character for the country as a · whole.
NEED OF A CURRENT AND TIDE SURVEY IN DELAWARE RIVER AXO BAY

The current and tide surveys of the various harbors are being taken UJ? in the order of their importance from. a. civil a11:d military standpomt and with reference to the needs of the marmer. Th,~ Federal engineers charged with the development of the harbor of and approaches to Philadelphia have requeste,d that that port ~e the next taken up in order that the data obtained may be applied to the study of the dredged channels, with a vie.w to so laying out tlws£' channels as to take udva.ntage of all natural flow and therefore decrease the cost of maintenance. 'V11at has been done in New York and San Francisco Harbors i11 the past two fiscal years is now planned for Delaware Bay and tributaries, for in addition to the value of such a survey to the Federal engineers, a knowledge of the behavior of the currents is of great importance to shipping. Beginning in July, 1924, a comprehensive current and tide survey is to be made in Delaware Bay and tributaries and, as soon as possible with the small force of mathematicians in the division of tides and currents, the results of this survey will be made available.
IMPORTANCE OF SURVEYS JN ALASKA

One of the greatest tasks which confronts this bureau is the completion of the survey of Alaskan waters. Alaska may be considered as the last American frontier, and as it is not connected by railroad with the continental United St~tes, it is entirely de.Pendent upon water-borne transportation for its development. It 1s known that Alaska is extremely rich in -its vast and varied amount .(>f natural' resources, which includes such much needed· products as crude oil, coal, timbe11 for paper, pulp, marble, hunber, and enormous quantities of food fish. The. greater part of Alaskan wn.ters still remains unsurveyed; even though the bureau's activities throlJghout the pas~ years have extended to the limits of the appropriations.of Congress, available for such work, and ·great headway has .been made. :By far the largest proportion of the Alaska waterways is e:x~ tremely deep; in many ca8es 25 to 50 yards from the high-water

mark there is a depth in· excess of 100 fathoms of water. However, to the hydrographer the survey of these waters presents one of the tnost difficult problems on account of the prevalence of pinnacle rocks which rise abruptly from the bottom to near the snrface, the existence of which can not, in most cases, be determined by the usual method of sounding. To meet this problem it is necessary to be as-1 sured that all dangers to mwigation are located and accurntely determined, that these waters be covered with a wire drag. In l!H4 ! he dragging of the main ship channels of southeast Alaska, through which most of the vessels entering and leaving the Territory pass, was commenced and completed during the year 1923, nnd a. similar . survey of the different bays which are now of commercial im- \ portance is being executed this year and will be cont inned next year. I The survey of the thousands of miles of shore line of western Alaska \ presents an extremely difficult and important problem. which here' i tofore, owing to lack of proper equipment, could not hr l'conomicn lly un~ertaken. Dnring the last fiscal year it was possible, owing to I the addition of seaworthy vessels, to commence work in this vast / area, which will be continued to the limit of the availnble appropria- \' tion during this fiscal year and in the future. Only the roughest sort of reconnaissance has been done in the Aleutian Islands, which lie wrstward of the.A1nska Peninsula. and it is 'hoped this yeRr to be \. able to make at· least a reconnaissance of this area so that a definite plan may be adopted to chart· adequately these :11rnny islands and shoals. As mentioned in my report of last year, numerous requests for sin·,·eys in this Y\}st territory are rereiYe1l by the bnrean. illl of which are given ·very careful'consideration, and emphasize the ·importance nnd magnitude of· the tasks which con from this bureau with the limited: equip~1ent and appara~us avni.lnble for the work, ns well as the comparatively short durat10n of time when work c.an be economically executed. During the present fiscnl year the survey has made a careful wire-dray surwy of Kasaan Hay nnd 'f.w111Ye Mile Arm at the requl'st of the ·war Dep11rtment for its us{>. in laying the Alnsknn cable. Extensive surveys have been and are now being exe·cuted at the reCJ.uest. of th~ Navy Departmen~ in this v~st area. Every request which is received from steamship compnmes operatin~ vessels in Alaskan waters, or from private citizens and corporations, is given very careful consideration and is executed at as early a date as possible. For the completion of the work in , southeastern Alaska two main projects have been borne in mind and work will be continuously carried on until they are completed. The first and most important is the wire-drag development of the important waterways. As stated above, this fiscal year saw the completion of the most important part of this project when the inside passage from Dixon Entrance north of Cross Sound via 'Vrungell Straits, was completed, and now the different important harbors and bays along this steamship route will be dragged at as early a date as possible. The other project is the completio? of tl~e sun·ey of the \ outside coast of. southeastern Alaska from Dixon Entrance northward and extending from the beach to the 1,000-fathom curve. The largest of our vessels has been engaged on this work for the last four seasons and should be kept on this project until this area is coml pletecl. l

CHAPTER III
SUPPLY BASE FOR WESTERN ALASKA

For many years I haYe strongly advocated the purchase of a Government supply base in western Alaska. Up to the present time there has been no action taken for securing such a reservation for the use of Government vessels. With the increasing commercial and ~ornrnmental activities in western Alaska and the very great need !or a place where. vessels can take on fuel, water, make repairs, and for other purposes, we are not only facing the difficulty of getting a suitable place but we are certainly each year by the postponement making it certain that we will have to pay a large price to secure a proper location when such action is finally forced upon ns. Twelve years ago the Government could have purchased a suitable place for a nominal sum in an excellent harbor in the Aleutian Islands and a property that would meet 'the full needs for years to come. Whether this can be purchased now is a question. In any event it wo\lld be an economical mo\·e for the Government to consider seriously the wisdom of securing such a base in ,Bristol Bay .or Dutch Harbor. ·

ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE WASHINGTON OFFICE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR

The organization of the Washington office of the bureau is presented by the organization chart opposite. The accomplishments during the fiscal year by divisi~ns and sections follow.
CHIEF CLER!{

. The principal .duties of this division are the care, custody, and upkeep ot_ the buildings occupied by_ the b~reau; the supervision of ~he expenditures for office expenses, mcludmg the purchase of supplies for the office, for chart printing w<;>rk, and to some extent for the field, the care of .most of the original records of the field surveys, as well as the library of printed publications; the general supervision of all. matters relating to the 'personnel work, including reports of leaves of absence; the custody and accounting for the receipts from the .sale of charts, publications, etc.; and the direction of the engineer, ~lectrician,. watch, messenger, labor forces, and other employees engaged in the care, maintenance, and protection.of the buildings occupied by the bureau in the District of Columbia. · . The more important accomplishments during the Y.ear have been a continuation of the thorough renovation of the bmldings. While this work is still in progress and it is a lengthy ;Program with the small force of employees and funds available, the improvements and sanitation that are necessary, the present accomplishments in· the way of painted rooms and modern fixtures offer a very· pleasing contrast when compared with conditions and equipment previously ex-. isting.· ' . . . During the year plans were perfected. for. the installation of allmetal storage racks in which to place the copper plates. from which are printed navigation charts issued by the bureau, and racks for one storage room were completed. These racks are to replace old wooden racks that constitute a fire hazard, besides having become so weakened by necessary overloading, due to lack of other storage space, that they are collapsing under the load they are carrying. Storage space ~ records which are not used frequently but are of such importance that they must be within access when needed has always been considerable of a problem, due to the lack of adequa.t.e housmg quarters. During the year consideration was given to the utilization of an inclosed attic in the chart, instrument, and archives building. The matter of the structural stren~h of the framework of the building was placed before the Supervising Architect of the

This involves about:75 .per.cent ofth.e f·ntire personnel of the bureau and:8omething over 60.per cent:of its .(·Ost.' of operatie>n. Consequently, the accoxµplislunents 1of._tl;tis di_vii.;ion ·in·'the Washingtonoffiae have been largely of a.n.admuustrative and routine nature, which are evidenced only by the efficiency of. the Jield ope1·iltions. . : : . . .. . . · However, beginning two yea.rs ago and continued thrpugh this last fiscal year, afe.w additional field officers were given short details to· the office from time to time.; a.S ·they could, be spared from the field, to assist ill! the solution of some .o.f the problems of the ·division. · "With such assistance· it :has. been pos8ible tO. carry on some reseai·ch in sub9£>.c'ts 'Pertaining' fo, hydi·ograiphic .su.rvoyinQ". · .

A type of sounding machine suitable for navigation and for sb.rveying in depths up to .500 fathoms was designed and constructed during the year·. The latter mnchine·will be used .for navi~ation und for surveying up to tJ;ie.limit of its capacity. It is much ·smaller and cheaper than the deep-sea machine ..both in co8t of construction and · · operation. That the time which has been devotd to these investigations and experiments and the cost have been fully justified by results can not be questioned. The art of hydrographic surveys has been materially advanced by this work an~ th.e future should show a marked decrease in the unit cost of such work. Some 0£ the apparatus is rather costly, so that it will not be possible to equip all vessels at once, but as funds become available additional equipment will be purchased and installed upon .other vessels of this fl~et. · . . The office work on .the aerial phototopographic survey of the Mis~ sissippi River Delta', on which an· officer was ~ngaged at the time of my last annual report, was completed early'this year. A complete report of the methods used and the results obtained will be found .in special publication No;)05~ Aerinl Survey of the Mississippi River Delta~ · · At the request of the Signal Corps of the .Army, the division prepared special charts show~n:~ the most practicable location for a s~b marine cable from Ketchikan, Alaska, to deep water of the Pacific along a prescribed route, This involved careful study of all field notes and unpublished data in this office to find the shortest track as free as possible from rock; and abrupt changes in' depth. Where adequate information was not available this was obtained by a spe. . . . cial survey by one qf tho. parties ~hen in the. fiel~. . The section of vessels and equipment mamtamed superv1s10n over the floatjng equipment of the bureau and directed repair and upkeep work to the limit of the avai1able funds. Preliminary plans were prepared for the construction of a vessel of about 600 tons to replace two small >essels on the Atlantic and for two tenders for Alaska duty to replace two no longer fit for operation. This section desilQled the sounding machines mentioned above. The temporary detail of an additional .field officer to the section for three months assiste~ greatly in .the preparation of plans for reducing the cost of maintenance of the vessels. This officer also made a thorough inspection of all suryeying instruments in this office which are commonly used by parties working under the direction of the division, and all instruments worth repairing were put in serviceable condition. The coast-pilot section completed field work on Coast Pilot, Section C, Sandy Hook to Cape Henry, and brought out a new edition. Field work was also completed on Coast Pilot. Alaska, Part I.

DIVISION 01'' CHARTS

During the fiscal year the division of charts continued· it.s task of furnishing to the maritime public correct and up-to-date charts on which were incorporated the data obtained in the mass of information reaching this office from sources both within and without the service. It also made gratifying progresp in the production .of new charts resulting from the recent completion of surveys by our field parties or fro~ the policy of replacing certain existing charts with others conformmg to our present-day standards. . . . The quantity of the division's ·service is measured .in the long run by the volume of charts issued. It should be. noted, however, that the functi()n of the bureau is largely limited to the passive one of · supplying a demand which is determined by factors over which it has no control. The demand is determined by economic conditions, and the quality of the product has little to do with the number sold. We have a monopoly of a product indispensable :for certain purposes, and the chart-using public must· take what we give it. Therefore the distribution of charts in any one year is not a measure of their value in comparison with that of some alternat.ive product, but rather an indication of the relative activity of cerfain agencies of the Federal Government and of the fluctuations in economic conditions as they affect merchant shipping and those classes of our people who look to the sea for recreation. The total number of charts disposed of during the year was 221,543. This total constitutes a slight increase over that for 1922 and 1923. The sales, however, are slightly less than in 1923, the increase being in the free-issue column, particularly in the issue of char.ts to the Navy Department. In the improvement of the quality of our charts we have made continued progress. Every new or reconstructed chart which comes off the press l'esults in a ·better quality of service to the mariner. Last year'.s program of 27 new and 17 reconstructed charts was an unusually heavy one, and the results accomplished constitute a most gratifying ~hievement. · . . UP-TO-DATE CHARTs.-An item deserving major emphasis is the frequency with which our charts nre printed. Our coasts and harbors are undergoing constant and mpid evolution. Radical chan~es in certain of the areas covered by the charts are constantly bemg reported. These changes result to a minor extent from the operation of natural forces but in much greater degree from artificial improvements. The prompt charting of these changes is considered of such importance to the safety of navigation that It is given precedence over all other work. In order that the charts may be kept correct with respect to these chu11ges they are printed fre~uently in. small editions ; before each reprint the printing plate IS cor-: ~·ected to show tl1e new .data received .since the last preceding print.; and finally, before the chart is allowed to leave the office, it is cor~ rected by hand to show still later information of major importance.

36

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, !JO~T AND. GEODETIC SUR~Y

Thus, during the year just ended, while the number of cl,l,art;s disposed of was 221,543, the average stock carried was only 89;293. · The resulting turnover o:f stpck is 2.:0 times for all charts. · As a matter of fact, the actual. service ren,dered is even mor~ creditable than is indicated by !these fi~res. Chart6 of remote or unchangeab1e areas are printed in quantities to last several times the five months average, and ,that average is reduced to the figure given by a still greater frequency of printing of those charts where the changes occur. For example,· chart 8550, Prince William Sound, Alaska; covers an impo~a.nt ?:Ut unchangeable area. This chart has boon printed only ~w1ce durmg the last four fiscal years. Conversely, chart 369, New York Harbor, was printed five times during the past fiscal year and . was in hand for· a sixth printing at the cloSe of the year. I think we· may fairly assert tha.t our service in It.his respeet is unequaled ~y i;tny ·other principal maritime nation, although it is pr<>per to add 'that probably no other nation is confronted to the sam'e e~ent with'this prob~ei;n. of r'a pia ·and constant evol uti?n· . · · ! D~rmg the' year the d1vis10n undertook two new ·proJects, ·each representing an improvement in the quality of service to the public. · '.fhe5e projects were, first, char~ showing results of wirecdrag Work in Alaska, a'nd second, a new series of charts of the inland waters from Noi-~oll('to Key West, prepared· with special reference. to the neOO.s·of motor boatmen:. · · · · · Wnrn-Thu"<l CnAnTs.-For the past 20 years the Coast and Geodetic Survey· hll:S·.beem· making v.rire-dmg surveys ·of those areas of the United States and its possessions where are found abrupt in~ualities of depth. ··The dangers discovered ·during the course of tl11s work ha:ve been charted promptly and to that extent we have a:ff orde~ additional security to vessels. 'Ve have also told the mariner 1n a general way that certain wa.ters have been dragged and' the dangers discovered· charted, but we have not heretofore informed him definitely as to the areas to which that assurance applied. · Until this last item of information has been furnished the mariner we have not rendered him all possible service. Wire-drag work can not mean as much to him as it should until he is in a position to kn:ow definitely the exact location and extent of the waters it has rendered secure. For example, a vessel sailing between two ports may have an alternative of two ro-6.tes, one of which has been dragged, while the other has not. On the basis of the information heretofore frirnished the ~ariner could not choose the safer route, no matter how strong his inclination to do so. ' The problem of charting the results of wire-drag work in a way that will be readily comprehensible to the mariner is a difficult one. V e.rious factors make it impossible to pass on to the public any conception at once comprehensive and a:ccurate of the effective depths at low tide to which all areas covered by the drag have been swept. · Those difficulties constitute an explanation of the fact that the results have not sooner been shown on the published charts. However, last year it was decided that even though we can not 1Pve the mariner everything, we can give him enough to be of matenal help to him. Accordingly during the year the survey adopted a method of showing on the charts of southeast Alaska the areas which had been swept in such· a manner as to safeguar~ navigation. The

.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

·87

method used was to indicate ·on the chart by a green overprint all areas which had been swept to an effective depth of 30 .feet or more at. mean lower low water. Alaska was chosen for this first att.empt, because the great depth and ample width of channels had greatly simplified the results obtained. The easiest task was chosen first in the hope that our experience there might aid in the sloution of the problem in more difficult areas· elsewhere. · A number of the charts of southeast Alaska have now been issued containing this information, and it is being applied to the remaining charts of that area as rapidly as they come up for reprint. INSIDE RoUTE CnARTs.-The program of chart production for the year included a new series of 10 charts showing the inside route from Nor folk to Key West. The series was designed especially to meet the requirements of motor boatmen cruising in this section. There has been a tremendous increase in recent years in the number ?f craft of this character,, .both in .those engaged in fishing, _oystermg, or local transportation, and m the pleasure boats which annually make this cruise or some portion of it. · · On the series. of general coast charts these waters are covered by 25 charts, scale 1: 80,000. In this series the number was reduced to 10 charts on the same scale by charting the route in strips, usually three strips to the chart, thus elin'linating much general detail of no particular value to boats making this trip. The charts are printed on thin paper so as to be readily folded into compact space.
DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM

Special emphasis was placed during the year on certain phases of the work; this included: Maintenance of information service to local surveyors on practically the same basis as last year. The bureau is now in touch with 2,000 local surveyors who use niagn'e'tic metho'ds, 11nd has obtai.ned information in regard to the usefulness.to the local surveyor of .about 33.;3 per ~nt of its magnetic stations. A~ong other purposes ~o~ which magnetic inforltl.~tion ha~ be~n furnished are druta for av1at10n maps of the Army-; mformation m regard to magnetic storms to ·the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and tlw Experimental Publishing Co.; magnet~c.. declination tables for tl;te World Almanac ; tables ior ManuaJ ·for Northern Woodsmen for use in the Forest Service; data for the Carnegie Institution in its investigation of m11:gnetism by rota.tion; results of special observa.tions for the use of Docto'r Millikan, of the .California Institute of Technology, in his determination of the mass of the electron;. seismological data for Prof. Bailey Willis, of Leland Stanford University, in connection with the investigation of the Chilean earthquake. . . . . There h11os been continued improv~~ment in the methods of comP.uting and prepa:dng for publication its observatory publications; economics and new devfoes deyeloped within the divjsion .during the last two, years have reduced. the cost of the biennial .publications ~£ its .oqservatory results at. each of the five observatories by 62 per cent and have removed much of the drudgery and eyestrain previously suffered from the work.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

·Special attention has been given to the improvement and replacement o:f observatory instruments, much o:f this work having become .imperative on account of defects that have developed. Instruments long in use have been remodeled so that they are as satisfactory as new instruments at a very slight cost, through the effective work of the instrument division. The obser~ntory situation has been studied and special attention has been giYen to modernizing the conditions of the various observatories. The transfer of the P.orto Rico observatory from Vieques lsland to the main island of Porto Rico has been carefullv studied, in order to keep the cost at a minimum. The replacement of obsolete and unsatisfactory seismographs at the magnetic ob- · servatories is being studied and the installation o:f a single component of the new type at the Tucson observatory is exfected to meet the information that will be needed for this eventua replacement. Members of the division have taken part in the work of the American <Teophysical Union and the International Geodetic and ( l:eophysical Union, and hold- positions in these organizationi:. Contact with the work of other institutions and countries is particularly useful, as all of the work of the division is related to the study of the earth as a whole. Close cooperation has been maintained .with the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism 0£ the Carnegie Institution· 0£ Washington. The follo,ying publications have been issued during the year:
Magnetic Declination In Arkansas. (This is the first of the publications of magnetic data b~· States.) Horizontal Intensity Variometers. (Useful in observatory operation and improvt>ment in observatory instruments.) Observatory Results for 1919-20 for Porto Rico, Tucson, and Sitka. (Per,· ma.nent record of changes in the earth's magnetism.) Instructions for . the Compensation of the Magnetic Compass, prepared jointly with the division of hydrography and topography. (Instructions to officers of the survey In the use of the magnetic compass In hydrographic and magnetic work. ) · Results of Observations at the Time of the Solar Eclipse on September 10. 1923 (which was published by the Journal of Terrestrial· Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity).

. The following publications were in the hands of the printer but not issued at the close 0£ the fiscal year : ·
Magnetic Surveys. (A pamphlet for distribution to the public to meet demands for information which is now given with some detriment to field and .office work.) · Observatory Results for 1921-22 for Honolulu, Cheltenham, and Sitko. , · Magnetic Declination in Florida. Results of Observations made by the Bureau in 1923. (This makes available Jn convenient form the results of the year's work.)

An intensive campaign by the chie:f clerk to get in touch with local surveyors was extended to Alabamai.... Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Georgia, and New York. .Keports received from North <.Ja1·olina made the campaign unnecessary. It may therefore be c'onsidered that the contact with· local users of magnetic data is ·now on a satisfactory basis in 13 States. The new series of State publiCa~ ti on has proved most useful in furnishing information ·in a satisfactory forrn and in reducing the amount that has to be :furnished by letter; · · ·

PERSONNEL.-The need for an additio~ial ·mathematician~ two computers, and an additional clerk in this division is extremely urgent. The strong demand for its results has been indicated. It has only been possible to meet this demand by the temporary assign' ment of two computers normally assigned io another division. It is no longer possible to spare computei~s from that work, and unless relief is offered very soon the office work will begin to fall in arrears and the service to the public will have to be curtailed.

The work of the division of tides and currents is comprised under the following heads: Tidal observations and computations; current obse'i·vations and computations; predictions of tides and currents and preparation of annual tables of tide and current predictions; current and tidal surveys of our principal harbors; computation of data and discussion and interpretation of the results of such .:;urveys; physical oceanography; and the preparation of technical publications dealing with tides: currents, and related phenomena. Tidal observations were made at seven principal stations on the Atlantic coast, four on the Gulf coast, five on the Pacific coast, three in Alaska, and one at Honolulu, Ha:waii. The tidal inarigrams as they are received at this office have been tabulated as to hourly readings for the definition of all tidal planes. As a byproduct of the tidal work at these stations, these tabulations furnish a long ~eriod, sea-~evel datum for the use of engineers loc1tlly, and for initial or "tie-m" points for the net of precise levels which is being extended to all parts of the United States. The predictions of the tides for the calendar year 1925 were made during this fiscal year and the manuscript submitted for printing in three separate parts: Tide Tables. Atlantic Coast; Tide Tables, Pacific Coast; Tide Tables, United States and Foreign Ports. These tables have been printed and are ready for the mnnner. The following table showing the number of copies of the tide tables issued for each fiscal year since 1915 is indicative of the usefulness of these .publications:

are issued annually all over the country. These appear as separate tide tables for different localities and in almanacs and calendars. Some are sold and some given away in the form of advertisements, all reaching the public in useful form. In addition, the public receives the benefit of these predictions through the medium of the daily newspapers, a great many of which publish the tidal data in their columns, these data being furnished by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Observations of currents were ma.de at two light vessels on the Atlantic coast and one on the Pacific coast. Analysis of these observations have been made with regard to the relation between wind and cnrrent in order to correlate wind and current for the formulation M general rules on coastal currents for the aid of the mariner. The first results of this current work appeared as a separate current table for the calendar year 1923. These tables are being enlarged in scope and size from year to year. For the calendar year 1924 the current tables for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts included full predictions of slack water for every day in the year at 18 principal stations and data for 1,020 secondary stations, from which the times of slack water for these secondary places may be obtained by reference to t11e prediction of the currents for the principal stations. The predictions of the currents for the calendar year 1925 were made during this fiscal year and haw been printed, ready for the mariner, in two separute parts-Current Table..<> Atlantic Coast, and Current Tables Pacific Coast. The. following table shows the number of copies of the. current ta.bles issued for the fiscal year 1923:

The manuscript of A Manual of the Harmonic Analysis and Prediction of Tide.$ was completed and printed. This work is intended as a manual of instructions for the tidal mathematician and comprises 422 octavo pages of text, tables, and harmonic constants for the world, with 34 illustrations. The manuscript of a publication on the currents and tides of New York Harbor was prepared during the fiscal year and submitted to the printer. It will comprise about 150 octavo pa!reS, and constitutes the discussion and mterpretation of the results from the recent current and tidal survey of New York Harbor, correlated with scattered observations made at various times in the past. The sounding records as received from the hydrographic parties in the field have been checked promptly for tidal planes so that no delay has been occasioned the chart division in the publication of charts.. The manuscript of a publication on tidal bench marks in the District of Columbia has been prepared during the fiscal year, and

it is expe,ct.ed it will be ready; for printing about the middle of'the next fiscal year. . . , · . In compliance with a progr~m O"Qtlip.e<l in my annual report ~or 1923, a.n investigation was ma.de during this yea.r in connection with de,·isinO' a large tide gauge for our principal tide stations. somewhat along the lines of the portable uutomatic tide gauge recently developed by this bureau for field parties, looking toward a more efficient gauge than the present large one, both from the standpoint of· JI\Qre accurate records and economy in tabulating the records. Upon investio-ation, it was found that a. gauge had been developed i·ecently :for the Geological Survey by Carl H. Au, of Washington, D. 0., somewhat along the lines of t.Jw gauge proposed for development b:}' this bureau. One of this type gauge was purchased for testing as to its fitness for the purposes of this sQrvey. It is planned to install the gauge at 'W'"ashington soon after the beginning of the :next fiscal year. The· observations obtained from tlw <:nnent and tide survey of San Francisco Harbor have been partly analyzed during this fiscal year as they came from the field. T,hese analyses will be completed during the next fiscal year,, the. results discussed and interpreted,. and tlfo manuscript of a publication prepared similar to the one sent to· press for the port of New York. In addition the improvement to our prestint current predictions made possible by this survey are being incorporated in the present current tables for the use of the mariner. During this fiscal year, in addition to the duties of his own division, the chief of the division of tides and currents has devised a new type of pressure-sounding tube and a graph for temperature anq barometer corrections to soundings made with pressure tubes. This sounding tu.be has been tested, and the indications are that the necessary accuracy for surveyin~ purposes has been obtained when the tub.e is ~sed in cqnnecti~n. with the correction gr_aph for b~rOJI?- eter and .tempera.tu.re cond1t1ons of the field. Th1s tube will, If finally : adopted, make for considerable accuracy on surveys iu dep'ths from 15 to·100 fathoms, since heretofore all tests have proven existing pressure-sounding tubes unsatisfactory and not of the desired accuracy for hydrograpbic. surveys.
.. Dl\'ISION OF , ACCOUN'l'S

From July 1, 1923i to June 30, 1924, the actual disbursements on accoun:t of·· appropru~ti~~s, for . the Coast and Geodetic . Survey amounted to $2,128,984.97. It must be understood, however, that this does not ..represent the actual expenses of the survey for the fiscal year 1924, but only the actual disbursements. In· a separate report.' to Congress wil~ .be. 1oun~ an itewized statement showing disbursements from each a,ppropriation and subitems thereof with all detailed information as to the character of the expenditure. . These expenditures include the acco1:mts of all chiefs of parti~s in the field locate«;! throughout the Umted .States, Alaska, Hawa11, ·P0t>to Rico, the Philippines, and the Virgin.Islands.

sion, and accounts arising under such advances were submitted to and through this division to the Treasury Department. The total appropriations for the fiscal year 1924 were $2,186,275.
INSTRUMENT DIVISION

The instrument division is charged with the duty of providing the instrumental eqmpment used by the survey which involves the acquirement of standard instruments and preparation of drawings and specifications :for those of special design; repair and adjustment of instruments returned after use in the field; and issue and maintenance of a property record system. In addition this division· designs new instruments and apparatus to meet the survey's ilnusual needs and makes any improvements in existing types which experience indicates advisable. . Efforts are constantly being made to improve the· instrumental equipment in accuracy, portability, ruggedness, etc.; to make use of improved materials and methods of construction; and to reduce the cost. . ,.. During the past year several new instruments were developed, ' including a triangulation signal lamp £or use in mountainous regions, which is smaller and lighter than those used heretofore; an automatic time switch for the above lamp which permits the lamp to burn for a given number of hours each night for a period of a week without attention. · Experiments were made in connection with the radio acoustic· work ~nd a simple and inexpensive bomb was perfected, using an_ explosIVe charge of trinitrotoluol. Improvements were made in the desi~s of the Coast SurveJr model portable automatic tide gauge which resulted in· practically '. total elimination.of loss of records due to failure of the mstrument and increased its sensitivity to the rise and fall of the tide. ,, This division cooperated with the division of tides and currents in develoj>ment of the Rude-Fischer sounding tube and w~th the other divisions by analyzing and working out suggestions they have made for improvements. ·

DIVISION OF CHARTS

,

The di vision of charts, in its task of constructing new charts or reconstructing existing charts basing them on modern field surveys, is now so nearly caught up with the field work of the survey that the division can not lay out jn advance a program of work of this character based on recently completed field work which will be tidequate to tax its capacity for the coming year; nor can it. anticipate the receipt. of records of field vrnrk now in progress with sufficient. certainty !\S to d.ate of receipt and condition of records to justify a general inclusiol;l of such field work in the program for the year. A program of chart production calling for the completion of 16. charts has therefore been a9,opted tentatively. In nddition, ns much time as possible :will be devoted to the following two items. REPRODUCTION 01" vVORN-0UT ORIGINAL S1rn1-;;rs.-As the result of age and :frequent use, a considerable number of our c.arly original sheets have reached a condition where their early redrawing becomes imperative if the records are to be preserved. As these records are invaluable and can not be duplicated, this task is one which should not be delayed .any longer. It is hoped to make material progres:: with this task durmg the year. . . CHARTING 01''.-'\VrRE-DRAOGED Am-:As.-During the. year it is expected.to ~mplete the application to Alaska charts of the ove1·p1'.int showing areas '\'>;hich have been swept by the wire drag. ·Further st\idy, will also.~ given this subject with a view to extend.ing. the work.to include areas, oh the Atlantic coast .where the shallowness of the. water: and the oonseq.uent (:omplication o:f the field records mnkes the task a much. more difficult· one. . . DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETIS;\f The program for 1925 is as :follows: · 9omplete the observ;atory pul:>li~ati.ons of Tucson illld Porto Hico for the printer. · . . Complete the pu,blicfl,.~ion ;for Missouri. · · · Pt·eparefhe ~t~te pubHcations .fo1~ North Qarolipa, Cal1for'nia, aud. Texas~ . . .. Prepare' for pi.lblieatio~ magnetic results obtained ch11fog rn24. · Prepare a new publication to replace Principal FactB of the Earl h ·s Magnetism.

Fun1ish information to local sur,·eyors :md those persons or· institutions investigating: difficulties in radio. telegraph, and cable communication. Furnish magnetic information .for charts. . Direct u.nd make plans for the transfer of the magnetic observa-' torv at Yieq11e:' Island to the main island of Porto Rico. Study the seismograph results from. Tucson to determine whether an insti'Wnent of low cost is now available for replacing the obsolete instruments. · Begin the discussion of observatory results a.S a .whole in coopero.-' tion with other organizations in an effort to solve some of the my$ries of the earth's magnetism. Continue work on the preparation of observittory results for 1923-24, in so far as the limited personnel permits. This important part of the work will suffer seriously if additional personnel is not proYided.
DI\"ISION OF 'l'IDF,S AXD CURREXTS

The program for the division of tides and currents for the fiscal year ending ,June 30, 1925, is as follows: The predictions for the tide tables for the calendar year 1926 will be completed, the manuscript scanned to prevent errors creeping in, and submitted to the printer intime for issuance before July 1, 1925. The predictions for the current tables for the calendar year 1926 will be made and the manuscript submitted to the printer. The sounding records received from the hydrographic J?arties will be checked for tidal data as received, so that no dela.y will be occasioned the chart division in the publication of charts. The bench-mark records received from the field will be compute<l for those demanding immediate attention and the remainder kept up to date as the force of mathematicians will allow. The manuscript of a publication on the currents and tides 0£ San Francisco Bay and trioutaries will be completed and sent to press toward the end of the fiscal year. This publication will include the results and the discussion and interpretation of the current and tide survey made in that ha1·bor during this fiscal year, correlated with all obser,·ations made at various times in .the ·past. The manuscript of a publication on tidal bench marks in the Dis-. trict of Columbia will be completed and sent to press about tl1e middle. 0£ the fiscal vear. .A,s, the depleted force of mathematicians becomes filled by reason of increased compensation due to. the classification act, the study of mean sea le,·e.J, an important mn.tter, will be taken up and the manuscript of a publication prepared ;when results warr.ant. · · A study of the efficiencv 0£ present methods of tabulating tida 1 records will be continued, fooking toward a saving 0£ time of mathematicians engaged on this work. An investigation will also be made as to ijie.pra.cticability of utilizing mechanical analyzers for the harmonic analysis of tidal curves. . . At present, in .the prediction of tides with the tide-predicting mo.chine, the machine automa.tically locks when each high and each low wa.ter is indicated until the observer has recorded the prediction. The observer then unlocks the machine by a slight pressure on the

48

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SUBVEY

handle, which he. turns until the next high or low ·water is indicated. Early in the next fiscal year it is planned, if practicable to do so, to install a light electric motor for the operation of the predicting machine and add an attachment which will print automatically the times and heights of the high and low waters in lieu of the locking of the machine. Should the plan· prove feasible, a considerable saving in time will be accomplished and, in addition, an increased accuracy obtained by the elimination of the human-error factor. The observations obtained on the current and tide survey of Delaware Bay and tributaries will be analyzed as soon as po913ible upon their receipt from the field, the results discussed and inter- · preted, and the manuscript on this important piece of work prepa,red for distribution to engineers and the interested public. In addi~ion~ the improvement to our present current predictions made possible by this survey will be incorporated in the present current tableE< for the use of the mariner. Heretofore the current tables ha,·e given the mariner the times of slack water only and the mean current velocity. Due to the diurnal inequality in the currents on the Pacific eoast, it is also of value to the mariner to know the velocity of each flood and ebb current at strength and the time of such maximum strength, since the velocity at strength on one flood or ebb current may differ materially from that of the next. It is planned, therefore, during the next fiscal year to prepare constants for the tide-predicting machine from such data as may be available and include in the Current Tables, Pacific Coast, the additional information relative to the prediction of the time and velocity at strength of each flood and ebb current at the principal current stations for every day in the year. A publication detailing the methods of determining tidal datum plane~ will ?e be~run, a~d it is hoped that it ~vill be possible to ~om plete it durmg the commg fiscal year. It will be of very considerable assistance to engineers in the establishment of datum planes that can be reestablished in the future, and thus correlate surveys made at various times. . The foregoing constitutes the outstanding features of the program for the next fiscal year in addition to· the normal routine work of the division of tides and currents. In general the work will be so arranged as to take up immediately the work upon which the publication ·of charts and the prosecution of the general field work of the bureau depend; after that the energies of the division will be directed toward keeping the tidal and current tabulations and computations up to date and to issue in the form of publications the large masS' of material that has accumulated and which is of considerable value to the na,·igator, engineer, scientist, and public generally.

The program for the fiscal year 1!}24-25 will be to maintain the existing stock of instruments in readiness for use, making needed repairs, and replenishing depleted stocks: to make improvements in instrumental design and construction, and to design and build such new instrument8 and machines as muy be needed: to construct about 100 new instrnments of special types, including sounding clocks, automatic signal lamplighters, heliotropes. etc.; and to complete the machine designed and partially built during the previous year for applying the graduation on geodetic level rods. It is estimate~ that this machine~ in addition to doing more accurate work than has been possible heretofore, will reduce the time for finishing a rod by 75 per cent.

PART III.-IN THE FIELD
CHAPTER I
ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE FIELD DURING THE FISCAL YEAR
ffYDROGR,\PHIC WORK

The Jiscal year 19:24 has been an exceptionally ,oucel·ssful one in regard to the amount o:f hydrographic surveys aceomplishcd. One of the most important advancements made in hydrographic work was the successful use o:f the sonic depth finder on the steamer Guide. During the enrly part of the fiscal year this vessel was undergoing repairs and testing out an apparatus :for the determination o:f the ship's position by the radio nccoustic method. Late~ the vessel left the east coast undn orders to proceed to the coast of southern California via the Panama. Canal. En route an extensive program of deep-sea soundings was carried out. On this trip the sonic depth finder was used with success in var~·ing depths of water from 100 to 4,600 fathoms. The sonic soundings were supplemented by 'vire measurements, in which the serial temperatures of the water and samples of same were obtained, as well as samples of the bottom. From the results of this cruise an extensive stud,· hns been made of the wlocity of sound in water under varying coi1ditions of density~ salinity, etc .. which knowledge is essential for the successful use of th~ sonic depth tin.der in hy~rographic sun-eyin!f. The results obtamed were except10nally satisfnetory, and n det111led st11dy of them has been made. The instructions under which the oeennographic work was carried on by the party on the steamer (;11.irlc. called for soundings in the deep· north of Porto Rico. and all soundings were so arranged as to supplement the soundings taken }.ll"Pviously by Coast Survey vessels along the sailing route from the l'ast to the west coast via the Panama Canal. On the Atlantic <'oast a party on one of our n~1;i:;e]s has been employed in surveys off the coast of North Carolina 'lnring the summer months and the east coast of Florida in the winter. 'l'he survey of the approach to Sabine Pass, Gulf of Mexico, has been completed bv two suneying vessels. The wire-drag work of Vieques Sound, P. R:, was completed early in the fiscal year, an<l the hydro~raphic surveys, including wire-drag work, 0£ the Virgin Islands were approximately 85 per cent completed. It was possible to continue the important work of wire dragging along the New England coast during the summer of 1923. Unfortunately it was not practicable to organize a wire-drag party for this work during May, 1924. as previously planned, as such a party could not operate after July L owing to insufficient funds appropriated :for the fiscal year 1925. The triangulation of Lake Okeechobee, Fla., was exP('lHed ~lnring the

year. Thii-; will furnish control for making a detailed topographic and hy<lrographic surv.ey of this im.portant inside waterway. Detadw1l launch parties were engaged i.1;1 resurvey work in important areas such as Baltimore, Md., Cape Fear Hirnr, Hawaiian Islands, and Portsmouth, N. H. Owing to the· lack of adequate equipment and appropriations it has been impossible to accomplish much of the extremely important 'rnrk along the Pacific coast. The arrival of the Guide marks a new Ppoth in the surveys of this important area. Upon her arriYal at San Diego the party undertook ·work along the southern California ("Oast during the winter months. This work marked the first suc<'essfnl use of the ru<lio accoustic method of determination of the ship's position in actual hydrographic work. Owing to the prernlence of foggy weather along the Pacific coast the pro~rress of t.he hydrogra phic parties in the past has been slow, Ill'> clear "·eather is neces;.;ary to accurately locate the position of soundings. The successful use of the accoustic method of the determination of the ship:s position has made ~t possible to carry on hydrographic wot·k in foggy and misty weather, which is so prevalent in this area. During the latt~r part of the fiscal year the party was also engaged in the execution of important suryeys in the vicinity of Cape Blanco, all' area in which few soundings have heretofore been made, and extremely important as one of the turning points on the main steamship ront'.e along the Pacific ~oast of the United States. In .Alaska four vessels have been operating: <lnri.I1g- the fiscal year during all months when it wus possible i>c·onomically to accomplish :-;1irYey work. The moist important work in Alaska-nmnel~', the wire dragging of the inside passage from the boundary line north to Ca.pe Spencer, via 'Vrangell Strait--\\·as completed durin~ the fiscal yea1·, and the vessel engaged in drag operations in the important bays and harbors along the main steamship i·oute. This work included t.be completion of wfre-drag work of Tweh·e :!\file Arm and Kasaan ~ny, which work contributed in no little degree to the successful laymg of the Alaska cable. One of the surYeymg vessels accomplished a gre~t dca1 of work in extending. the surveys_ northward along the outside coast. At the end of the fiscal year tins work was c~mpleted to a point about 30 miles north of Cape Ommaney. 'With the addition of the two mine sweepers it has been possible to undertake the much needed surveys in western Alaska. · ·One of these vessels completed the survey of Kachemak Bay and bays in the vicinity of the oil fields in 'Shelikof Straits. The other complet~d surveys of bays along the Alaskan, Peninsula, thlil suney of which is important, as the work previously shown on the chart is :based on rough sketches and from the copy of the old Russian charts of this area. · In t~.e Philippine Islands three vessels haYe been employed in extendmg the surveys of these .waters. Two of these were executing work in the Sulu Sea, while one was engaged during part of the j'ear on the south coast of Mindanao and later in the execution of Sl~rveys on the north coast of Luzon.

of the fiscal year until October 29, when the season's work was completed and the launches laid up for the winter, the party returning to this office on November 2 to complete the field records. The launch Mikawe was engaged in inshore hydrographic work in the vicinity of Cape Fear River, N. C., and also a survey of Frying Pan Shoal from the first of the fiscal year to November 15, on which date the work was discontinued and the launch laid up, the party returning to the office at Washington to complete the 1·ecords of the season's work. The launch Elsie was engaged in the triangulation work necessary for control for a topographic and hydrographic survey of Lake Okeechobee, Fla., from January 14 to March 17. Upon completion of this work the launch was used by the party on the steamer Bache in the execution of inshore hydrographic work in the vicinity of St. Augustine, Fla., on which work it was engaged at the close of the fiscal year. · A party was engaged upon a revision survey of Baltimore Harbor from February· 6 to the end of the fiscal year. A wire drag examination of the entrance to Portsmouth Harbor was executed by the party in charge from June 7 to 13. A party was engaged in a resurvey of Scitutate Harbor from June 19 to the end of the fiscal year. · · In addition to the above, small parties made a search for a rock reported in the harbor at Blaine, Wash., and a topographic revision in the vicinity of Long View, Oreg., and located the new wharves along the water front of Philadelphia, Pa. A party was also engaged in hydrographic and topographic surveys· in the Hawaiian Islands from September 25 until the end of the fiscal year. These surveys are important and are being done at the request of other departments of the Government.

The field projects, either completed or on which progress was made during the year, are as follows: The triangulation from the vicinity of Pocatello, Idaho, northward to the Canadian boundary, begun in 1V22, was completed during the fiscal year. . The triangulation was run along the forty-ninth parallel about 50 miles east and west of the one hundred and eleventh meridian. This work is part of the cooperative plan between the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Geodetic Survey of Canada, by which precise triangulation will be extended from the Pacific coast along the international boundary to Lake Superior. A. precise base has been measured .at Boundary, Mont. Reconnaissance was continued along the forty-ninth parallel from Glacier Park to one hundred and eleventh meridian. The triangulation begun in the fiscal year 1923 at the request of the commissioners of the Supreme Court for the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma was completed and a copy of the final results sent to the commissioners.

At the close of the fiscal year a reconnai;;:>unce was being made for a line of precise traverse which is to ·run from the ninety-eighth meridian in the. vicinity of Mitchell to Chamberlain, S. Dak. Triangulation will be run westward from that point to the one hundred a.nd fourth meridian. Triangulation was rnn along the boundary line between the counties of Maricopa and Yavapai,· Ariz. This work was requested by the officials of the two counties involved. Xnmerous disputes had arisen in regard to the boundary, which was originally based on astronomic observations for latitude. The work o:f the Coast and Geodetic Survey consisted of an arc of precise triangulation along the boundary. with triangulation of n lower grade connecting the precise stations with points on the boundary itself. Toward the close of the fiscal year a precise triangulation party was being organized to operate along the international boundary between Minnesota and Manitoba. The triangulation started in 1922 in Alaska northward of Cook Inlet was continued toward Fairbanks. A primary traverse. was run from West Palm Beach to Lake Okeechobee, Fla., for the purpose of furnishing starting data :for the triangulation of Lake Okeechobee. At the close of the fiscal year a primary traverse which is to run from Beaufort to Charleston, S. C .. was in progress ... This project also includes trian_gulation around Charleston a1id north along the coast to 1Viti.yah J:Say. A primary traverse line from Myrtle Beach to 'Vinyah Bay was also in progress. It is believed that this work will be completed during the fiscal year 1925. The tritmgulation in California begun in the' last fiscal year to detect, if possible, nwrnments of the ground which haYe taken place since the first establishment of the triangulation stations about 30 years ago was continued. The operations were carried on from the vicinitv of Mount Hamilton, on which is located Lick Observatory, sm1thward to Santa Barbara Channel. It is expected that a junction will be made in the fiscal year 1925 of the triangulation to the north and that to the south. A precise tl'Urnrse "·as run along th<' Canadian National Railway from Warroad, Minn., to Fort Frances, Ontario, thence on the ice through Rainy Lake and N nmakan Lake. At the eastern end of this line are two quadrilaterals of precise triangulation. This is a part of the cooperative work between the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Geodetic Survey of Canada . .A. party w11s operating in southeastern .Alaska during the latter part of the fiscal year in measuring recise base lines and observing horizontal angles for the purpose o controlling the lengths of the triangulation and to connect the triangulation of southeast .A.la.ska to that to the southward of Dixon Entrance made bv the Geodetic Survey of Canada. . · The geographic position of the Pacific milestone of the Lee Highway Association at San Diego, Calif., was determined by a short traverse from established trianguliition. Secondary triangulatio~l. was executed to furnish points for the control of a hydrographic survey. of Lake Okeechobee, Fla. The. starting datum was obtained from the line of traverse from ·:west Palm Beach to the eastern shore of the lake.

REPORT OF THE DIREOTOR, CO.AST AND GEODETIC SUR.VE!:

·. The precise leveling in Montana begun in 1923 to provide elevations along ·a number of roads through the Yellowstone Park,. Wyo., was completed during the year. This work was done at the request of the United States Geological Survey .. Precise leveling was: con:tinued in the States of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Ma.ine; and also·inthe States of California and Oregon· for revision puriposes. The precise leveling line' begun in the summer of 1922 along the railroad; which runs from Anchora~ northward to Fairbanks; Alaska, and .along the highway. from the latter place southeastwa.'rd to Valdez, was continued during the fiscal year. This leveling was requested by the United States Geological Survey. , A·party determined the val~e o! gravity at nine stations in so~th-' eastern Texas. These determmat10ns were requested by the United Sta~ Geological Survey and were a continuance of the work started during the: previous year. · 'A .-combined astronomic and gravity ·party operated· in Alaska~ Latitude, longitude, azimuth, and grav:ity were observe-0 at s&.ven stations. The new Eckhardt-Karcher radio recorder was used sue-' cessfully in connection with the longitude and gravit)' workv. A party operating in the State of .Washington determined the longitude of Alki Point; a Laplace station "<if the Pi1get Sound triangulation. · ·
MAGNETIC WORK
,!
'I

The magn.et~c work accomplished during the yefll" is. as follows: The magnetic resurvey of North Carolma, made with the·cooper· ation of the Geological and Economic Survey of that State; was about 64/er cent completed at the end of the y·ear. · " A goo start was made on the magnetic resurvey of Georgia, and observations ";ere made at the county seats of seven new counties where there had been no previous observations: also a resurvey of Texas;' particularly in the eastern part. Several stations were occu-' pied in South Carolina. Considerable resurving with replacement of stations was done in California.. 1'he special survey to determine the existence of IOce.l disturbances was made along the coast from t.he Mexican bo1·der to San Pedro. Repeat stations were occupied in the northern tier of States from Illinois. to yermont, and also in Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyommg. 9bservations were made at Lompoc, Calif., during the total solar eclipse of September 10, 1923, and special observations were made a.t all of the observatories at that time. Magnetic observations were made by the parties of the various vessels in Alaska. Routine observations of all the magnetic elements were continued at all of the observafories during the year, as follows: CHELTENHAM.-A small building for special observations was compl~, and experiment.al l!ork was started' which it i~ hoped will l-eSult m future economies m the work. : A tornado m June nearly wrecked the variation building, but serious damage to the instruments was escaped. A part of the roof was removed but was quickly replaced. During the year comparison observations were made,·with the instruments of the department of terres~al magnet.ism ·of the

at Atlantic City, on the Atlantic coast, a contract was let on May 8, 1924, for the establishment of a princii;>al tidal station on the ocean wharf of the Scripps Institute for B10logical Research at La Jolla, Calif. The officers of the Scripps Institute have expressed a willingness to cooperate with the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the maintenance of this tidal station, to the mutual advantage of both organizations. For the purpose of protecting the tidal series and insuring the safety of the tidal observations made along the Atlantic coast a precise leveling party began operations at Cape Charles, Va., on August 4 and continued to September 4, 1923, releveling between existing bench marks at all stations from Cape Charles, Va., to Southport, Conn. New stan4ard disk bench marks were installed where found necessary or advisable. In order to insure the proper functioning and efficiency of the t.idal stations on the Pacific coast an officer of this bureau visited all of the stations along the Pacific coast during the past fiscal year, releveled to all existing bench marks, and where necessary installed standard disk bench marks. The portable automatic tide gauge recently developed by this bureau, with a view to economy of installation and maintenance for short series of tidal observations, has been established during the past year at Biddeford Pool, Me.; Dumbarton, Suisun Point, and Los Angeles, Calif.; Duwamish River, Wash.; and Valdez, Alaska. The combined length of these observations is about 22 months, and the indications are that the instrument will prove a success for the purpose for which it was intended. . . TEMPERATURE AND DENSITY OnSERVATIONs.-Temperature ·and density observations, frequently requested from this office by prospective builders in connection with cold-storage plants, by fishing concerns, and especially by men enga~ed in scientific investigation, ure being made at Diamond Shoal Light Vessel, Nantucket Shoals Light Vessel, and at the following principal tidal stations:
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Portland, Me. noston, Mass. Atlantic City, N. J. Phlludelphla, Pa. Baltimore, Md. 6. Chui:leston, S. O. 7. Cedar Keys, Fla. 8. Pensacola, Fla. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. Galveston, Tex. San Diego, Calif. Los Angeles, Calif. San Francisco, Calif. Seattle, Wash. Anacortes, Wash. Olympia, Wash. Ketchikan, Alaska.

In addition, short series of temperature and density observations were made at 51 stations during the tide and current survey of San Francisco Bay. Since these observations are obtained at no increased cost to the survey, it is planned to gradually increase the scope of this work so as to include all of the principal tidal stations and as many of the light vessels as possible. Current observations were made during the year on two light vessels on the Atlantic coast and two on the Pacific coast. Ln nddition, short series of observations were made at six stations. The combined current observations total 3 years and 10 months of records.

CHAPTER II
PRESENT CONDl'l'ION OF HYDROGRAPHIC, GEODETIC, MAGNETIC, AND TIDE AND CURRENT SURVEYS
Il YDROGUAI'IIIC WOUK

It has been found convenient to arnrnge this work in the form of separate projects. These projects may be divided into two classes! as follows: (1) .Unchangeable areas, (2) changeable areas which will require contmuing operations for an indefinite period. In the first class there are offshore hydrography of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts; wire-drag work on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, including Porto Rico and southeast Alaska; the first complete i;:urvey of certain sections of southern and western Alaska, which are of immediate commercial importance. No estimate is made of the Aleutian Islands west of Unalaska, moRt of the area in Bering Sea or Arctic Alaska, since their commercia.l development seems to belong to the distant future. For the offshore work we have planned to go seaward to a depth of 100 fathoms in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico and to a depth of 1,000 fathoms in the Pacific Ocean. When these ocean surveys have been accomplished in accordance with present standards there will be no necessity for additional work mside of the 100-fothom depths on the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico and the 1,000-fathom depths on the Pacific Ocean except in those places of comparntively shallow depths, such as Georges Bank. Nantucket Shoals, Diamond Shoals. and the shallow coastal waters which are subject to constant changes. Likewise, after the surveys of the desiit.,mated sections of Alaskn., the Hnwaiian, and Phili:r,pine waters have been completed, the only additional w&rk that will be required in these ureas will he such as may result from changes in localities of shallow depth or where greatly increased commercial importance necessitates more detailed- surveys of small bodies of water or where changes have resulted from publir works undertaken rnbsequent to the original survey and. work in the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean. · The second class of work--chart revision and the resurvey of the bays and inside waters of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States and, to a lesser extent, o:f Alaska and the insular possessions-must be carried on indefinitely, just as we are to-day resurveying waters that have been adequat<lly SlllTeyed several times in the past. This is due to the fact thati the forces of nature ,are continuously cutting out and building up along the entire shore whefo the formation is not solid rock; and also to the :fact that the indnstt·ial development of the country is continuously changing both the ~vaterways and shore faw by .Qn,clginµ· r.hunneh;, filling in, constructing piers, and other works. ln order thiit the l'h11.rts may be kept up

to date and be of real service to the mariner, it is necessary that they be correeted from time to time to show these changes. The oceanographic work which the bureau should carry on can not be treated as a project on which any time limit for completion can be ginm. At the present time there is an urgent need for the detail of one able vessel on this work on the Atlantic coast, for the exploration of the Gulf Stream is one of the problems that was laid down in the organic act creating the Coast Survey. \Ve have done very little work of this kind in the hundred and more years of the existence of the survey. These projects do not inclu<le all of the work that should be performed by the bureau in the line of hydrography and topography, but it is believed that they do include all the projects that should be undertaken at this time or in the near future, the other work to be deferred until the completion of some of these projects. After the completion of any of these projects the personnel and equipment that had been employed on the project ·will be available for other work. This other work includes hydrographic investigations beyond the limits of the: present projects and other special investigations. It is clearly the duty of this country to perform its share of ocean investigation, and there is a large field for such investigation in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico contiguous to our coast but outside of the lOO~fathom contour. Thero is a like need for such work in the Pacific Ocean outside of the 1,000-fathom contour, which is comparatively close to our coast. There are fishing banks seaward of the 1,000-fathom contour in the Pacific Ocean that should be investigated for the benefit of our fisheries. There is a stretch of unexplored water extending hundreds of miles west of the Hawaiian group through wh~ch our ships are required to pass. These waters are known to contam many shoals, reefs, and rocks that are a menace to navigation. The survey of these waters, together with resurveys of ~he shallow, changeable offshore waters, would fully employ any ' equipment and personnel that would be released on the completion of any of the projects which require similar equipment. .

·

GEODETIC WORK

There are several phases on the subject of geodetic surveys which of necessity must be considered in any comprehensive report; but I wish to emJ?llllsize, first, that phase of geodetic surveying whi(!h is of great practical value to the people of this country. This is the money value of geodetic surveys to those engaged in commerce and industry Qr. in the affairs of the various political units of the country. A century or more ago the countries of Europe realized that the only way to safeguard the property rights of their citizens was to base the surveys of the private property lines on definite systems of coordinates. By this means there could never be any doubt as to the exact points which control the area of a farm or other pieces of property. It is easy to see that if the latitudes and longitudes of points on the earth's surface are determined those points can be found at any subsequent date ~ven though the markers have been destroyed. Latitudes an<i longitudes !must be shown on all sailing charts to enable the navigator to find his way from one port to nu·

REPORT OF THE DffiECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

63

other. It is also necessary that latitudes and longitudes be used on the maps of the different parts of a large urea, such as that of the United States, in order that a correct idea of the relative positions of different unit areas may be gained. As far as private property surveys are concerned, latitudes and llon¥itudes are not essential, for a system o:f plane coordinates for ·limited areas may be used, but it is necessary to have a survey based on latitudes and longitudes over the whole urea in order that the local plane coordinate urea may be correlateu. It might also be noted that the connection of the :farm survey, large or small, with the main triangulation of the United States, correlated as it is on a standard geodetic datum, would make the 20,000 and more points o:f the na, tional survey witness marks for the .local survey. Although latitudes and longitudes are necessary for the proper correlation of maps of wide areas, it is impossible by observations on the stars alone to determine latitudes and longitudes with sufficient accuracy for surveying, mapping, and other engineering purposes. This is due to the fact that the plumb line is pulled away from the true vertical by mountain masses and other topographic features. There are a number of classic examples of the inadequacy of astronomical observations to determine the distances between points. In Porto Rico the astronomic latjtude was observed at Ponce, on the southern coast, and at San Juan, on the northern coast. Later these two stations were connected by an arc ·of triangulation which furnished the distance across the island with an error certainly less ' than 10 feet. The difference between the distance measured directly r by triangulation and that computed from the difference in astronomic latitudes was more tJ1an a mile. The Spanish charts used prior to the acquiring of the. island by the United States, some 26 years ago, had the island of Porto Rico 1 mile wider than it actually is. It is probable that this discrepancy led to disasters to ships navigating the surrounding waters. Certainly the distortions in :the charts that were inevitable in trying to fit the surveys based on ·these two astronomic stations would be great. : In Thibet, in central Asia, the distance between two stations de·rived from astronomic latitudes was nearly a mile and a half · i shorter than the distance obtained from accurate triangulation. !There are many cases in the United States where the astronomic ; position of a point differs one-fourth mile or more from its true lposition as determined by triangulation. These difficulties with asltronomic observations and their inadequacy to{roperly control suri"Veys and maps nave led to the development o a system called triangulation for the determinations of latitude and longitude which meets all of the modern requirements and certainly will be adequate for conditions that may develop in the future. The Coast and Geodetic Survey immediately on its organization . more than a century ago laid plans to have the highest grade of triangulation extended along our shores in order to properly co;rrelate the surveys and charts of our outer coasts and of the various · harbors, bays, and rivers· along it. The ·bureau has always realized the impossibility of extending surweys ..and. charts over .great areas Without the control furnished ,by triangulation.!, !tr.even went so .far as to extend an arc of precise triangulation from the Atlantic to

the Pacific uoast, approximately along the thirty-ninth parallel, in order to obtain the proper relation in geographic position between points on the east and west coasts of the country. When maps were first made, in the interior of the country there were no triangulation stations available, and in consequence separate astronomical stations were used on which to base the several maps that were. made. The result of this early work and especially the laying out of the boundaries between States and even between counties by astronomic observations has led to much confusion. There have been many cases where resort to courts was necessary to straighten out tangles in the records of boundary surveys. There are pending now a number of cases which may result in court action. There is much confusion in the use of topographic maps which show the configuration of the ground as well as geographic positions and elevations of topographic :features when they have been based on astronomic observat10ns and assumed elevations. This may seem to be a small matter. to one giving only casual thought to the case; but when we realize that these maps are the basis to-day :for many engineering projects, including the extension, improvement, and upkeep of our vast highway system at a large cost per mile, it is realized that the distance, as shown by the maps; should have a high degree of accuracy. A small pe.r cent of error in the length of a roud, as scaled :from a map, will affect the cost of the road proportionately. Either the county 01· the State or the contractor .will suffer, and as is always the case where accurate data are not available the contractor must add to his estimated cost ~nough to guard against inaccurate data if the error should be agamst him. The leasing of grazing lands and the utilization of the forest products of the country depend on the area· involved. These areas should be aoouratelv indicated on the map, and will he if the map itself is accurate. The map cnn not be accurate without the proper control which is supplied by the geodetic survey carried on by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. ' After extension of the transcontinental arc of pr~ise triangulation and the lines of precise levels which were imn incident thereto there was u]most immediately created a demand for similar accurate geodetic data fo other parts of the interior of the country. The control surveys of the country must be made at some time. They a.re needed now, and for any great degree of accuracy that is requisite for the uses to which the data are put one organization for the whole country should do the work. It would he a most wasteful procedure to force each State to have its own geodetic service, with ·its overhead expenses, office buildings, equipment for the office and field, including expensive instruments, and a tra:ined staff to do the geodetic work within its borders. It is far better that the public should turn over some of its funds in the form of taxes to the Coast and Geodetic Survey to·do something for it at a far smaller cost than would be possible if the work were divided among the several States. Every geodetic survey that is -made adds to the wealth of the countcy1 .not in a direct way but in an indirect way, ·and there.fore the cost of making the surveys should ·not be conside1-ed as a part of the upirnep of running expenses of the Government but as an actui1l

Any engine.er of wide ex- , perience witl'i. maps in extending highways, erecting du.ms and Power plants, making city plans, and numerous other operations Will ~tify as to the great value of maps based upon accurate geodetic control. He will nlso testify as to the losses which have oeen or may be incurred by ha.ving to work with poor or inadequnte lllll.p data. A long step toward securing topographi~ maps for the unmapped portion of the country was taken by the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives when, on May 27, 1924, henrings were grunted to representatives of organizations interested in or using maps very extensively. The result of the hearings was. a favorable report on the Temple bill by the committee. In order that this mapping- may be done properly, howeYer, it will be necessary to have thousands of miles of new· arcs of precisu triangulation und lines of precise leveling connecting the areas which are to he topographieally mappe.d. This work will have to be done 'by the Con.st and Geodetic Survey, and it should precede thP. topographic mapping. In fact, it is necessary thnt the precise-con. trol surveys should be done ahead of it if the mapping is to be clone in. a satisfuctory mu.nner. While we may not know it, we are really losing money and restricting thei activities of our people by not having had the geodetic control surv{'.ys. completed before now. The facts set forth above should convince the appropriating officials of the Government that far more :adequiitc provision for the 0ontrol system .of the country llmst be made than has been done in the past. It should· be remembered that when the precise control surveys are mnde over. an area they do not have to be repeated in the future. Outcropping· rocks nnd heavy concrete blocks are used in marking ·the triangulation and leveling stations, and these last for many vear8 u.nd make it. unnecessary to reproduce the geodetic surveys. · · TwQ ·notable cn.seS' of .the mm of geodetic methods in· boundary surveys have occurred during the pust year. One wns in connection \Vith the establishment of the boundary along the Red River between 'rexas nnd Oklahoma to .the westward of the ninety-eighth meridian. lt was desired by the commissioners appointed for that .bound:i.ry to ha.ve the coordinates of the topographic features along the boundary determined with great :iccnracy.. After careful consideration and consultation between the commissioners and the officials of the Const und .Geodetic Survey it was decided that the commissioners nnd the surYe;\' should cooperate in the ·extension of precise tl'iangu~ation along that portion of the boun:dnry for which .surveys were linme~liately net,tled. ·This work was undertaken by the engineers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and carried through to a successful completion nt a very small cost. The field expenses, aside .from the. salaries of the regular employees of the Coast .and· Geodetic Sur~ \rey, 'yere paid from funds raised hy the commissioners. The sur".ey furnished all instrumental equipment and made the computations necessary to obtain the finitl geograi)hic positions. .This is . th.e first instance, as far as this office.is aware, of the use ,of precise ti·1angulation ulong a boundary 1ine· bAtWeen two'8taites, to be used for the accurate location and perpetuation 0£ the boundary line.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

The great advantage of having precise triangulation for the control of boundary surveys is that it makes it possible to recover very accurately the position of any topographic feature, monument.' or other mark essential to the proper identification of the boundary line should such mark be destroyed between the first and subsequent surveys. The other instance of the use of geodetic methods for a boundary survey was that between Yavapai and Maricopa Counties, Ariz. This boundary was defined by- law as following for most of its distance certain parallels of latitude and oblique lines between designated points. It was laid down by engineers of the two counties working separately and at different times. Necessarily the astronomic observations for latitude were affected by the mountain ranges in the vicinity of the work. As the two or more engineers involvecl in the surveys used different points for their latitude observations, their results were affected by different amounts. The result of this situation was that a strip of valuable territory was claimed by each of the counties. After correspondence with officials of the Coast and Geodetic Survey the officials of the two counties involved decided to ask the survey to establish a line by geodetic methods. This consisted in carrying an arc of precise triangl}.lation along the boundary and connecting the precise stations with f:>oints on the boundary itself by means of triangulation of a lower grade. The work was successfully carried out to the mutual satisfaction of the officials of the counties and the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The cost of the work was exceedingly small. The field expenses were paid from the county funds, while the Coast and Geodetic Survey paid the salaries of its regular employees connected with the work and furnished all instrumental equipment and automobile trucks and made the computationd of the field observations. It is believed that in the future there will be many cases where this bureau will be called upon by States and counties to establish accurately the monuments along their boundaries. A broad field of surveymg which is but now awakening to the great value of precise control covers the making of topographic and cadastral maps of our cities. What little has already been done in providing control for such uses has been largely with the cooperation, direct or indirect, of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The first triangulation of a large city made as a major undertaking-the survey of Greater New York-was by direct cooperation, that survey being under the charge of an officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey ana. the adjusted computations being made in this office. A little later a precise survey of Cincinnati, including triangulation, precise leveia, and topography, was executed under the direction of a man who was wholly trained in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, but who at that time had no official connection therewith. This also was true in the case of the triangulation of the city of Richmond, Va., completed but two years ago. Frequent aid has also been given cities/lanning precise surveys in the way of conferences, inspections, an (in the case of Columbus, Ohio). the preparation of a set of specifications to meet the particuln1· needs of that city;; ·

Special Publication No. 91, The Use of Geodetic Control for City Surveys, was prepared especially as !ln aid to cities in the making of accurate surveys. When one considers that 51.4 per cent of the people of America live in cities, and that a little more than onethird of the taxes on real pro:perty is collected therefrom, one can not question the wisdom and Justice of extending precise geodetic control over the areas of these cities in order that they may have accurate cadastral maps for all tax purposes and accurate topographic maps for all planning. Geodetic surveys are a necessary part of the surveying and mapping and some of the other engmeering activities of the Federal Government, States, cities, and private corporations and individuals. The geodetic work is not a prominent part of these various operations, but it is just as essential as the work done in a mine to strip away the surface material to make the ore available. Geodetic work may be likened to the steel fromework and foundation of a large modern building which are covered up by the various parts of the building but perform an essential function. The country is losing money in two ways because of inoomplete topographic mapping. One is that there are no maps in many critical areas in which engineering work is being undertaken. A lack of complete knowledge of the oonfiguration of all of the area that influences engineering operations may result in money being spent in building plants of one kind or another which may be too large for the purpose served or totally ina.dequate for it. Take, for instance, a case of power development. The most complete information should be available in regard to the area drained, the rainfall, the rate of run-off, and the possibility of storing or holding back the waters during flood seasons in order 'to have a certain minimum flow requisite to operate the plant and supply the customers who use the product. There are cases where forests and mines can not be economically worked because of a lack of knowledge of topographical condition!'! in their vicinity. · The cost to the public in the form of losses in thr operating of the projects are far greater than would be the cost of makin~ the topographic map for the area involved. The money spent m many projects which fail would have boon saved had adequate topographic information been available before the projects were started. The second way in which the country is losing money because of inadequate maps is the direct loss owing to the fact thnt lack of data keeps concealed the possibilities of initiating and completing many enterprises which would be extremely profitable and useful. This is notably the case along watercourses which are susceptible <;>f power development where, owing to a lack of knowledge of the configuration of the ground, the power is not developed. Even where the private corporations mnke surveys before engaging in engineering operations the public really pays ~or that work. The corporation must add to its capital account or take from its surplus the costs of all private surveys, whether it is found that the proposition investigated is ·or ·is ~not suitable for industrinl plants. These surveys serYe no useft1l p\11·1iose 'ttfter the ·corporation has

All of tlwse los&'s could he obviated if the topographic map based 011 accmatc control suneys were rapidly <~xtended over the eo11ntry to uit·et all tlu·1;e nePlh. It mu:;t lH' renw111hcrcrl that suitnhh~ topogrnphic 1111tps can not Le made aheiHl of tlw geo<lctic control surn~ys. In fact, there arc cases on record where the topogTnphic brnnch of the United States (jeological Survey woul<l not undertake topographic rnapi:i in certain areas, en'n though the States involved offp1·('>(l to pay half of the expenses of the work, l>~cansP the Coast and Geodetic Survey had not at the time Pxtende<l its control sm·veys to those areas. I nn\Stigations caniPd on by tlw Coa1;t and Geodetie Survey during the past. 25 years haye n'sulted in a large increase in the knowlP<lgc of the earth's crust and the processes which change the elevation and g<>ogmphic positions of points on its 1;11rface. The information 11sed in these im·estigations has been lurgply the Yalue. of the attractiYe force of the earth, called gravity, cletPrmined at a number of stat ions in tlw country. The geologists l'll{!ai.re<l in ho th theoretical and prnctieal work arn 11sing the results of these investigations, and it is reasonably <~e11 ain that in the vears to come the economic geologists on whoin depends the development of our mineral resources will b<> able to work mo1·e pfff>ctivelv n8 11 l'<'Sttlt of these investigations. · Much remains to be done, as, for example, tho determination of the ''alues of gra.vity at stntions on islands and coasts -near our borders; This does not apply to the Canadian border, for the Government of that D0111inion, realizing the importance of determining the value of gravity. has Pstablished a nu111ber of gravity stations within its area. It i15 felt that the geological processes which have been at work in this country ha vn extended to contiguous areas, and hence the necessity of collecting information from them. The desirability of loeating gnn-ity statious in. rugged, broken, mHuntainous country has long been recognized, but the difficulties of transporting the heavy instrumental equipment and in finding or huilding a suitable constant temperature room for the pendulum has made the cost almost prohibitive away from the rn,ilroads and telegraph lines. The new i11"ar pendulums and the new radio recorder have (hme much to overeome these difficulties. The invar pendulums change so little with changes of temperature that a tent may be used in which to swing them, and the Naval Observatory time signals transmitted by the Annapolis radio station can be received and recorded with the new recording apparatus anywhere in the United States and at least in the nearer parts of Alaska. A very interesting group of gravity stations was occupied in southeast Alaska during the season of 1923. This work was a very severe test for the radio recorder, as the distance from Annapolis is nearly 3,000 miles. Several of the stations are on small rocky islands surrounded bv deep water, and all of them are in or near mountainous country. The anomalies at these stations are of unusual value for

· making studies of the isostatic condition of the earth's crust and in learning more about the densities of rocks concealed in the crust. In spite of recent improvements in the methods and apparatus the determination of the intensity of gravity is still a long and expensive process. Even w4en the stations a.re close together an observer can not average more than about four per month. The chief of the division of geodesy has for some time been studying the problem of a. new type of apparatus ·which will be easier to transport . and will not require so much time per station. His efforts along this line have induced several other scientists to tackle the problem, namely, Prof. A. A. Michelson, of Chicago University; Dr. F. E. 'Vright, of the Geophysical Luborntory; and Dr. Louis T. E. Thompson, of the Aberdeen J>rovin~ Grounds, u.nd as a result there are now thr.ee new types of apparatus which have reached .the experimental . stage. One is ba..,ed on a special form of interferometer, another on a qmu·t.z spiral spring-, and the third depei~ds on measuring the ucce]cra.tion of a freely falling body by means of a quartz tuning fork. Doctor 'Yright ·expects to test his apparatus (the quartz spring) in the field in the very near future. The laboratory tests so far have been promising. ~--·--I wish again to ca11 attention to the value .of the triangulation which has been extended along th~ Mississippi River in times past by the commission appointed to control floods and build dikes along that river. This triangulation had its geogruphic positions based on sep:1rato astronomic stations, each of which \YUS affected by the attraction: of the nearby topogmphy, and. therefore these geographic positions do not Jit into the. triungu1ution system of the countr,v as a whole. The results of the t.riangulation are really not now available to the surveyor und engineer, but they could bl'. made available by a recomputation whi~h would place the geographic positions of the stations on the natrnnal datum. A small amount of money ma.de available in each of two fiscal vears would enable the Coast and. Geodetic Sur\'ey to recomputl~ tii.i!? valuable material. The Missis. sippi River Commission feels that it is not authorized by law to make a recolll(lutation of its triangulation, as it claims that the positions now available mct>t. nil the needs of that body. . For two yPars Congress has uppropriutl'd money to makl>, n. computation and adjustment of the Hawaiian triangulation which was executed many years .ago while Ha.waii mis a kingdom. This work . ~s being canied on expe;<litiously, and it is believl'd that only a small sum will he needed durmg the fisca.l year 1926 to complete the com. putations. The results of this work will lie of great value to the. . Federal Govemment and to the Territorial goYenuuent in the execu. tion of surveying and engineering operations. The outstanding accomplishments of the year m the geodetic operations of the bureau are indicated below: A Jong step forward was made in the science and encrineering of geodesy when an observer of the Coast nnd Geodet.ichSurvev tle. termined the astronomic longitudes of n number of stations in s'outheastern Alaska during the summar of 1923, using the Eckhardt. Rarcher longitude apparatus ;for· receiving and recording- aut.otnatically the.,time signals which. werQ se:i;it. from; the N u,yal. Observatory at Washington through the Annapolis radio station. The

distance between 'Vashington and the stations averaged about 3,0011 · miles, and the results obtained were as accurate as those for much shorter distances. A station was also established near Seattle, more than 2,000 miles :from "Washington, with the same apparatus. The success of this radio recording apparatus, which was made by Drs. B. A. Bckhardt and J. C. Karcher, of the Bureau of Standards, at the request of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, will make it possible to determine with great accuracy the longitudes of places which are not within reach of the land wires and oceanic cables. With so many high-powered sending stations distributed over the world, accurate geodetic longitudes can now oo obtained almost anywhere. Thus, surveying and mapping operations may be greatly improved over what they were in the past. ' The Coast and Geodetic Survey has continued throughout the year active geodetic cooperation with the Geodetic Survey of Canada on the arc of precise triangulation which will extend :from Puget Sound northward to the head of Lynn Canal, near Skagway. This is part of the cooperative plan between these two organizations which, when further extended, will make· it possible to compnw triangulation in Alaska on the same datum that is used now in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Continuous triangulation is of great benefit in avoiding discrepancies in the maps of two countries at their common border. The geographic positions of the topographic features shown on the two systems of maps will be the same, and thus confusion as to the location of the boundary is avoided The cooperation between these two bureaus involves also the completion of an arc of triangulation which will extend from Lake Superior along our northern boundary to the Pacific coast. Eitch of the bureaus .is doing approximately one-half of the work. The two bureaus have also cooperated in the coordination of the precise level lines of the two countries where they touch each other along the boundary between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic coast. The :friendly spirit shown by the officials of the two bureaus in furthering the interest of the two countries in this geodetic cooperation is to be highly commended. They are working in the most unselfish and generous way. A traverse party of the Coast and Geodetic Survey operated along the Rainy River and across Rainy Lake, part of the boundary between Minnesota and Canada, during the midwinter. The party measured distances over the ice between a number of observation stations located on small islands. The temperature was at times as low as 38° F. below zero, but in spite of this and many other hardships there was no injury to any member of the party, owing largely to the forethought of the chief of party and his 11Ssistants in planninp: for the work. . Horizontal angle observations had been measured at a number of the stations during the summeri of 1923, but the water was too nar~ row to permit accurate triangulation to be carried along it, and the contiguous land areas were so swampy that triangulation with sides of reasonable length would have been exceedingly expensive. The shores· .of these bodies of water ·a..r~ so r;ugged and so overgrown with trees and ibrush that ·it was. impossible to measu~e along them. The expedient of measuring over the ice was forced upon us, and

though it was something new in the way of geodetic work by this bureau the work was done very successfully, and the results were most satisfactory. Triangulation in California for the purpose of detecting earth movements was continued during the summer and fall of 1923. The operations were carried on from the vicinity of Mount Hamilton, on which is located Lick Observatory, southward to the Santa Barbara channel. Owing to fog conditions late in August, which prevented observations along the Santa Barbara Channel, the party was moved: to the southward, where observations were begun at the old triangulation station on Cuyamaca Mountain near the Mexican border and were extended northward along the coast into the Santa Barbara Channel. · Exhaustion of the funds available for this work prevented a connection of this southern end with the work to the northward. This connection and other important triangulation will be undertaken during the fiscal year 1925. The work in California is a remeasurement of the horizontal angles of the triangulation starting from stations Mount Lolra and Round Top in the eastern part of the State and extending approximately along the thirty-ninth parallel of Latitude to the Pacific coast and thence along the coast to the Mexican boundary. The. geographic positions resulting from the new observations differ materially from those computed from the earlier observations made 30 or 40 years ago. Important discoveries in the form of unmistakable earth movements, some of which are as great as 10 or 15 feet, justify the continuation of this work to study the rates of movement of mountain peaks and other points in California. It is hoped that this work will result in a better knowledge of the laws which govern earthqUJ8.ke activities and will make it possible to determine within reasonable limits the place iind time where earthquakes are most likely to occur. This work was undertaken at the beginning of the fiscal year 1923 as a part of a cooperative arrangement made between the committee on seismology of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and the Coast and Geodetic Survey. It is believed by those who have investigated the accumulated data that the work is of exceedingly great importance in the attempt to solve certain major earth problems. A party of the Coast and Geodetic Survey continued the triangulation in the interior of Alaska which was started two years previously. This triangulation begins.at the coast at the head of Cook Inlet and will extend northward to Fairbanks and thence will branch in several directions in order to furnish accurate iO'eol;l"aphic positions for the use of the General Land Office, which is aymg out public lands, and the United States Geological Survey, which is making topographic ma.ps of Alaska. The work in Alaska is exceedingly difficult owing to the lack of roads, the many rivers and streams which must be forded, and the soft character of the ground. In many places the soft moss makes travel extremely difficult. During the year four precise leveling projects were completed. The work in Connecticut, whi~h had been done at the request of the United States Geological·Survey,- wastcontinuetl·through Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, to Portland, Me. ·This

is the first time that some of these States had been entered by the pre~:ise leveling operations of the Coast and Geodetic Snney and the work supplies a region greatly in need of accurate elevations. At the request of the United States Geological Survey a system of precise levels was extended along the roads through Yellowstone National Park, "\Vyo. The system was connected with the precise level net of the United States in that locality and with the bench marks of the survey at Cody and Moran, "\Vyo. The first link in the proposed precise level net of Alaska has been completed. This link, the result of two seasons of work, extends along the Alaska Railroad from Seward through Anchorage to Fairbankl:l, and thence along the Richardson Highwa~1 to Valdez. At Anchomge and Valdez the work was connected w1th mean sea level obtained from short series of tidal observations. The precise leveling along the Southern Pacific Railroad between Weed, Calif., and Portland, Oreg.; along the Union Pacific Railroad between Portland, Oreg., and Centralia, W?ash.; and a short section.near Fort Ste:vens, Oreg., was revised during the yeai·. This revision work makes possible the assignment of definite values to the elevations of the bench marks in this territory. It is proposed to pub~ish the results of all precise leveling in Ore::on during the commg year. . There has been effective cooperation between the Coast and Geo-. detic Smvey and other organizations and individuals during the year. The Coast and Geodetic. Survey has cooperated with. the Geological Survey to the extent of determining the value of gravity. ~ta numb~r of stations in Texas for testing certain theories involved m ccononuc geology. . . In the isostatic investigations macl~ by the Goast and Geodetic Survey it was found that the value of gravity at a station depends to a certain extent on the distribution of materials of different densi-· ties close to the station. As the eiu-th's crust is in approximate equilibrium iit all places as far as the investigations have be~n. carried on, it is evident that if two gravity stations close together have· decidedly different values, where theoretically they should ba the same, the cause must be in the outer portion of the earth's crust rather than far below in the lower part of the crust or lo~fill'. Cer7. tain oil investigations indicate that there arc decided differences in· density in the material of the old fields. If gravity observations can detect these abnormal densities, the ohselTa.tions may be of very grca( economic importance. The Coast and Geodetic Survey has been coopera.ting with officials of the Geological Survey for a number of years in studyin" these very important phases of geology, · The Coast and Geodetic Survey has cooperated with the Seismological Commission of the Carnegie Institution of ·washington by. reobserving the angles of the triangulation in California for the purpose of detecting changes in geographic positions of 1i1ountain peaks and other places on which the old stations were established 30 or more years ago, with the commission appointed by the Supren1e Court .of the United Stutes in establishing the boundary between Texas and 0.klahoma. along the ~ed .liiver to, the westward of the ninety-eighth ,rn~ridµln,, a.n<l with Yavaj)ai and Maricopa Counties, .t\riz., by extending an arc of triangulation along, their common boundary for the ptirpose of fixing the boundary line permanently.

The Bm·ean 'of Standards has cooperated with the Coast and Geodetic Sune~' in continued study of methods for recording graphically the radio tmie sig-nals usr<l in precise longitude and gravity determinations, and also in tcstinµ: the stability of invar tapes used in precise base measurements. The Superintendent of the Naval Observatory and his staff cooperated with the Coast and, Geodetic Survey by sending special time signals between 3.f>5 and 4 o'clock a. m., eastern standard time, for use by the longitude party operating in Alaska. These special signals made it possible to compare the vVashington time with the time observed at. the Alaskan stations without having to depend on the chronometers for currying time for several hours. Greater accuracy was the result of this effective cooperation. L. A. McArthur has cooperated with the Const and Geodetic Survey by checking manuscript prepared for publication to make the descriptious and the names of the stations conform to the information obtained by the Oregon Geographic Board as to names of places, mountains, streams, and other grogrnphic features. The Coast and Geodetic S11rvey has cooperated with many engineers and others in and out of the Government by furnishing geographic positions of thousands of .triangulation and traverse stat10ns and the elevations of thousands of bench marks, and with several cities in their efforts to secure geodetic c.ontrol for their surveys. The cooperation of individuals and organizations in carrying on the geodetw work of the survey has been very much appreciated by the officials of the bureau, and it is hoped that such cooperation may be even more extensiYe in the years to come. Members of the Coast and Geodetic Survey have taken an active part in the American Geophysical Union "during the past year. This organization is a branch of the National Research Council and is the National Committee for Geophysics for this country of the International Geodetic and Geophysical Union. Several members of the survey have he.ld offices in the union and haYc been represented on its executive committee. The union serves a most useful purpose in bringing together the workers in geodesy, oceanogrn.phy, meteorology, voJcanolobry, seismology, and terrestrial magnetism and electricity, thus enabling them to cooperate in those phast>s of geophysics which have to do with more than one single branch. Members of the Coast and Geodetic Survey took an act.ive part in the formation of this union in 1919, just after the vVorld 'Var.

old stations, including the station and reference mark. The two lastnamed parts of the work are chief in ma~itude and importance. A program has been adopted which mcludes the occupation of about 40 stations a year for the purpose of supplementing the observatory observations in recording the changes m the earth's magnetism. These stations are scattered throughout the United States, . and the work is so planned that in so far as possible each one will be occupied at five-year intervals. The effort which was started the previous year to get in touch with county and other surveyors was successfully continued, and the bureau is now in touch with about 2,000 local surveyors. As a result of information from these surveyors and the field operations of the bureau the condition of 1,241 out 3,743, or 33.3 per cent of the total number, is now known. This is an increase of 12 per cent over the previous year. Four hundred and ten of these stations need replacement either in part or entirely, in addition to 159 which have been replaced or inspected during the year. The replacement program is now a very important part of the work. OnsERV.ATORIBS.-Each of the observatories is now furnishing a complete and continuous record of the values of the magnetic elements. As these instruments record only the variations, determinations of absolute values are frequently made. The result of this work is that at five widely scattered places within the jurisdiction of the United States-namely, Vieques, P. R.; Cheltenham, Md.; Tucson, Ariz.; Sitka, Alaska; and near Honolulu, Hawaii-continuous values of the magnetic elements are available. As a result it is possible to . reduce the values obtained in the field surveys to the standard values. Nood for this is indicated by the statement that without such correction the change is declination from year to year could not be furnished. The observatory records show magnetic storms for periods when the actual values differ more or less from the normal values. The observatories near the sea coast have an important function in that they indicate the rates of change from year to year over adjoining sea areas. This makes it unnecessary to remeasure the declination at fi·equent intervals. It has been definitely determined that during the next fiscal year the lease of the observatory grounds at Vieques, P. R., can not be extended beyond the next fiscal year. Plans are being made, therefore, to build an observatory on public land on the main island of Porto Rico, the replacement to extend over several years. Even with the old-type seismograph in use at stations except one a great amount of useful information in regard to earthquakes has been obtained. The observatories are in a position to do a much higher grade of seismological work. A test is being mo.de at Tucson to find the proper type of seismograph to replace the obsolete ones in use. . This bureau has not made magnetic observations at sea :for a number of years, as it has been felt that the observations of the . Oarnegie, combined with shore observations along the coast, give all necessary results. There is urgent need, however, for observations in the,shallpw waters along the, Atlantic, const, and the~ could be made.by JM11ns of.a nonmagnetic 1 launch or scow,which could' be held in a given direction.

shore observations, and accordingly the charts do not show areas of local disturbances. Unless it is found that t~e O(Jll"ll,8gw can be put into active service and can find it possible to make more detailed observations in the waters adjoining the United States and the regions under its jurisdiction it will be necessary to J?rovide a nonmagnetic vessel, preferably of moderate size. Pendm~ such a solut10n of the problem it will be very desiral!le to contmue along-shore determinations of declination, such as have been made during the. year in California and Alaska. ·
TIDE AND CURRENT WORK

It hus been recognized for a. number of years that insufficient observations in tide and current work have been made in our principal harbors, and that the conditions, particularly in regard to currents, were not so well ·known as present engineering problems and sizes of modern vessels require. However, tl1e surveys in New York Harbor in 1922 and in San Francisco Harbor in 1923, follow. ing during the coming fiscal year by surveys in Delaware Bay and · tributaries and in the Inside Passage to Alaska in 1926, will bring this phase of the work fairly well in hand. The field work of the New York Harbor. survey was done in cooperation with the Army engineers charged with the development of that harbor, who stood half the expense of field operations, the Coast and Geodetic Survey making all office computations, discussing, interpreting, and publishing the resulting data. In the San Francisco surve,r the Army engineers in that district were unable to cooperate directly in the field work on account of shortage of personnel and equipment. The Navy Department, however, furnished a part of the floating equipment necessary to the survey. Due to the fact that the currents in Seymour Narrows, British Columbia, are of the hydraulic type brought about by temporary differences of tidal action in head at the two ends of the strait, it is possible to make predictions on the tide-J?redicting machine of such currents by the analysis of tidal observations at the two ends. While these straits are British Columbian waters, accurate predictions of the times of slack of the extremely strong curr~ts are of considerable importance to United States vessels plying between our Pacific Northwest and southeastern Alaskan ports. No satisfactory series. of tidal. observations for these analyses were available for each end of the Narrows, but the Canadian Tidal and Current Survey, with a fine spirit of cooperation and· at the i·equest of this bureau, obtained three months of observations in the summer of 1923 and has furnished them to this office for analysis. From these observations it is expected to make a decided improvement in the predictions of slack water for this important thoroughfare. · Another example of cooperation in tidal and current work which has continued during this fiscal year between Canada, England, and the United States is the exchange of predictions for a number of por.ts, ~hich are. published bot~ ·in the:· British Admiralt.y and the Umted States Tide Tables. "Frve 'statwns were exchanged at the beginning of this· arrangement; this number was increased to 9, and for the past fiscal year to 15 stations. ·

REPORT OF THE DIR.ECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

In or<lcr to obtain oceanographic data in the Arctic, this survey is cooperating with the National Geographic Society by the loan of a number of current and other oceanographic instruments to Capt. Robert A. Bartlett. Under the direction of the National Geographic Society, Captain Bartlett is going to northern waters on a summer cruise of the United .States Coast Guard steamship Bem·. The Coast and Geodetic Survey is also cooperating with the de~ partment of operation and maintenance of the Panama Canal by the loan of instruments for the observations of currents on the lighthouse tender Frworite in the vicinity of Serrana Bank and Quita Suena, Reef in the Caribbean Sea. The information obtained will be forwarded to this oflicc for analysis. The survey has had three requests from foreign countries for information relative to the port.able automatic tide gauge re<.:ently developed by this bureau~ with a view to its adoption in harbor work-from the Harbors l:Soard of the Governm<>,nt of South Australia, at Adelaide; from the Rockha.mpton Harbors Board, lfockhampton, Queensland, Australia; and from the Hnrbor DP,pn.rtment of Public Works, Rotterdam, Holland. The funds available for tide and current work do not permit of extended observations in physical oceanography, comprising miscellaneous oceanographic observations and computations for the purpose of furnishing information on densities and temperatures of sea water, open ocean currents, and related matters, to na:vigators, · engineers, and scientists. Little has been done on this subject except :in a general way and of a reconnaissant nature. A study of the Gulf Stream is of considerable interest and value and may he considered us one· of the most important matters in oce1m0graphy, not only to the United States whose shores it parallels, but to Europe as well. Considerable reconnaissance work was done for a numoor of yoars by this bureau in this important field, hut lack of funds hus held up any further work. Systematic current and othe1· ocounograp_hic. observations should be continu_ed by the survey in this oceanic river. This office is using evm-y avaihtble means for obtaining density and temperature of sea water along our coast..~. They are being obtained nt 18 of the principal tidal stations maintained hy the bure,au a.nd on two light vessels, on which cmTent observations are being made through the cooperation of the Lighthouse Service. · The officer$ charged with the ~vork of the division of tides and currents are making every effort to reduce to a mini1irnm tlw routine w01·k necessary at this office. The desired re~mlts nt·e grnduallv Leing accomplished by the devising of new instruments, methocis, and forms for lessening this class of work. A burden on the division of this class of work, however, was added during the pust fiscal year .. Due to indications that some tide observers were being biased on · entering comparative notes on marigrams due fo their tabulutinµ: the records at t!1e field stations, this tabulating has practically all been done at tlus office for the past year~ The necessary means of precaution against the abov.e practice having been worked out, the method of fteld tabul11t.ine: has again been resumed at a number of tidal stations,.~nd it js planned to allow all of this WQrk to he han~ died by the fielJ observers by the end of the next ifiscal year. .

PROGRAM FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IN THE FIELD
IIYDHOGHAl'HlC A:XD 'fOl'OGHAI'HlC WORK

i ATLa:xnc CoAS'l.'.-0/J'slwre hydrography.-The steamship Lydonia will be employed on offshore hydrogrnphy from Cape Fear to "\Yinyah Buy during the summer seai:;on and southward of .Matanzas Inlet on the Florida coast during the "·inter season, If funds are then aYailable, the steamship Ranger will be employcu upon similar work during the last j)art of the tiscal year after having completed the sun·ey of the Virgin Islands. Re·v·isional sw·ve.1J8.-The steamship Bache, 'vi th one tender as an auxiliarv, will be employed on a resun·ey of the inshore waters along tlie coast from St. Augustine, Fla., to the Savannah RiYer, Ga. This will include also a hydrographic survey of the sounds and bays along this stretch of the coast and a revision of the shore line and adjacent topography. The steamship llyrographe1· will make a resurvey of Tampa Bay and approach, mcluding tributaries. A resurvey of Baltimore Harbor and of a part of the coast in the vicinity of Fire Island Inlet, N. Y., are now in progress. Several small re,·isional surveys will be made along the northern Atlantic coast if funds arc available. lnte1·ior surveys.-A surrny of Lake Okeechobee, Fla., begun last winter but discontinued late in the spring, will be resumed and carried to completion, if possible, next winter. Virgin lslands.-The steamship Ranger, with three wire-drag launches, will continue the hydrographic survey of the waters of the Virgin Islands. This will include all harbors and the coastal waters to the seaward limit of all danger. It is believed that this survey will be completed before next spring, after which the vessel and launches will be available for work on the United States Coast. PACIFIC CoABT.-Offshore hydrography.-Thesteamship Guide will be continued on the Oregon and California coasts, working in the vicinity of and southward from Cape Blanco during the summer season and northward· of San Diego during the winter season. One of the western Alaska vessels, the Discoverer or Pioneer, will join the Gidde on the southern California coast next winter, remaining on that work until time to take up work in Alaska next spring. The other western Alaska vessel will survey Monterey Bay and sea.ward to a depth of at least 1,000 :fathoms during the winter months. Revision surveys.-During the winter months several small revision surveys will be made at various places along this coast. Som:HEASTEUN ALAs1u.-The steamship Surveyor will be continued on origi_nal offshore and inshore hydrography, top?graphy., and triangulation along the coast of Baranof Island. This work is part of

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

the project for the survey of the seacoast of southeastern Alaska. It begins at Dixon Entrance and should be completed to Sitka Sound this year. This survev will be continued each year until it has been completed to Cross Sound. The steamship Ewplorer, with three auxiliary launches, will be continued on detached surveys of the most important of the yet unsurveyed bays and arms within the so-called inside waters of southeastern Alaska. WESTEnN AI,ASKA.-The steamship Discoverer will continue on original hydrographic surveys, topography, and triangulation along the southern side of the Alaska Peninsula from Chignik northward. The Discoverer will be employed on similar work southward of Unga Island. Each ship will have one tender in addition to her regular launch equipment. It is desirable that both vessels be continued upon this work until the entire southern side of the peninsula and approaches from seaward have been surveyed. If funds are available for alterations and for O,l)erating expenses, the motor ship Natoma will be put in commission and used on original surveys in Prince "Tilliam Sound. HAWAIIAN Isr,ANDs.-Inshore hydrography will be continued by one party around the coast of Oahu, and if funds are available the work will be extended to other islands of the group. PHILIPPINE IsLANDs.-Three steam vessels-the Pathfinder, Fathomer, and M arinduque-will continue the work now in hand until after a project has been adopted for the completion of the survey of the Archipelago. It is expected that before the close of this fiscal year such project will have been adopted. In general, the work for this year will be '-Original surveys, triangulation, topography, and hy<1rography north of Luzon, between monsoons, and in the Sulu Sea and west of Palawau. GEODETIC WORK TmANGULATION.-The work along the forty-ninth parallel will be continued during the fiscal year 1025. Tl11s is a part of the cooperative work with the Dominion of Canada, which has for its object the completion of an arc of precise triangulation along the boundary from the Pacific Ocean to Lake Superior. Another party will be engaged in running triangulation in northern Minnesota between Lake Namakan and Lake Superior. This project will complete the eastern. section of the cooperative work with Canada, which provided for the execution of the traverse and triangulation by the United States from the Lake of the "\Voods to Lake Superior. A party will also run precise triangulation in Utah from Salt Lake to Needles. Another project contemplated is a line of precise traverse in South Dakota, beginning at Mitchell and runnmg to Chamberlin. From Chamberlin triangulation will be run westward to the one hundred and fourth mendian, thence to the one hundred and eleventh meridian. · Precise triangulation will be continued in Alaska along the arc beginning at the head of Cook Inlet and running to Fairbanks. . . PRECISE ThAVERBE.-A precise traverse line will be run from the ninety-eighth meridian in the vicinity of Mitchell, S. Dak., to Cham-

berliri., S. Dak. Another line of traverse will be run in Texas from · the vicinitv of San Antonio westward to the Rio Grande River. PRECISE 'LEVELING.-One leveling party will run a line of recise levels in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and another a line o levels in the earthquake region in California. · ASTRONOMY A~'"D GRAVITY.-A number of Laplace stations will be established by a party working in California. Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma, and Colorado. No gravity work will be done during the fiscal year. MAGNETIC WORK

f

PnorosED FIEw ·wonK.-The magnetic resurvey of North Carolina will be completed during the first half of the year, work will be done in South Carolina and Georgia, and the magnetic resurvey and the occupation of county seats in Texas, where observations have not heretofore been made, will continue. Repeat stations will be occupied in New England, the Middle Atlantic States, in the Northwest~rn States, and in the Hawaiian Islands. A magnetic resurvey of the Philippine Islands will be made, with the cooperation of the insular government, and a survey of the Aleutian Islands, which will be carried on jointly with other work of the survey, will be started during the present fiscal year. This work is very urB'ently needed to meet the demands of vessels and to remedy defects m e:d.sting charts. The obscn'atories will continue their usual routine work. New construction in Porto Rico will make necessary the post12onement of needed impronments nt the other observntories. Their buildings nnd grounds w·ill be maintained in ns good condition as fonds permit. Preliminnry suneys of possible sites for the Porto Rico Observatory early in the year. The replacement of defective instruments will continue. During the months of July and August, 1924, it is proposed to make a comprehcnsiYe and final current and tide survey of Delaware Bay and tributaries for which an appropriation was made by the last Congress. Principal tidal stations representative of tidal conditions along the different stretches of coast will be maintained at the following places:

cont. r~l also of hydrog.mphic wo. rk 0~1 the c~ast!? of the Unit~d Statei;;/ Density· and .temperature .ob~errnt10ns will also be contmued at these stations. · . . . A tidal station will be established at. Washington, D. C., for the 1rnrpose of obtaining tidal data for the upper reaches of the Potomac ~iver .and tp furnish .a m~ans for'testing new instrwnents and appfr ances for the observation of tides under the direct supervision of this~ .office. . ' . Preliminary arrangements have been made for establishing a tidal.I station at Daytona, Fla., when the new wharf being erected at that place is comp)eted. This station will furnish tidal data for the e:x:_treme south Aqantic coast, replacing .the station at Fernandina, wl1ich was continued 'as \t principal station i.n· June, 1D24. . · It is u part of the progru1i1 of the tide and cprrent '"ork for the .fiscal year to con,tinue the installation of standard staffs and backing pieces to replace the old staffs at all the principal stations maintained by the. survey, . In orde1' to maintain a -fixed zero of staff, a most essential matter in obtaining a long series of tidal observations, tide stu:ffs of standard design with special backing piece, cap, and stop were designed in the division in 1V20, and installation of these is being made as the differcn't stations are visited, until all the priw cipal stations are so ~quippe(l. . . Provide~l the present appropriation for the year permits, a precise level !?arty will visit the locations of discontinued tidal stations along a sect10n of the Atlantic coast for the purpose of leveling to old non; re~ulation bench marks as they may be recovered nnd installing sufficient standard disk bench marks to comply with the present policy of the bureau of maintaining five standard marks at all stations having a year of observations, and one additional for each additional year of observations to a maximum of 10 standard marks. This work is nee· essary in order to perpetuate long series of obsenations wl1ich are , iiow preserved by :few nonregulation bench marks, many of which have been destroyed and others in danger of being lost. It is the program of the general tidal work of the bureau to extend this work over a long period and bring it graclu'.1-lly up to date l;>y .doing. S.j small amount of work each year wlnch the approprrnt10n will' warrant. During the year tidal bench marks at San Francisco will be checked by levels with the tidal series and sufficient new standard bench marks established to bring the number up to the requirements as set forth above. In order to carry on this essential bench-mark work:, it has been found necessary to curtail somewhat the current observa/ tions on the light vessels on both coasts. On the Atlantic coa~' observations will be continued 011 Nantucket Shoals, Diamond Shoals,,· and Overfalls Light Vessels. On the Pacific coast current observa· tions will be continued for the full year at Blunts Reef Light Vessel: Respectfully, E. LESTER J oxEs, Dilrect01·. · To Hon.
