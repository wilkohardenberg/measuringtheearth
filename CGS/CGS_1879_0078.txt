SIR: I have the lrnuor to transmit lterewitli a 1lPtaile1l report of the uperatious prosecuted iu the course of the fiscal ;rear 1·111ling .J1111e :~o, 1879, in co11ti1111atiou of the Cm1st aud Geodetic Survey of the United Statf>s. It will he seen by the table gfreu as Appendix No. 1, which shows the distribution of the fieltl aml h,v<lrographic parties, tbat tlw work has been ad ·auced in thirty of the States of the Union and in four of tbe Territories. In general, the \\'(\ather was f;worahle, and the regular work has been externled as far he,rowl the limits n'al·hecl in tl1c prl·et·tling ~·t·a1· as could be expected with the means aYailaule for the p<uties sen·rall,L During tbe earlier :rears of the surre;rJ neither the urgent 1lernaml for the irnportaut pmJimi· nary results, 11or the general state of the survey perrnitte<l eTery class of work for which the !:illl',,e~ was instituted to he taken in hand and advauced simultaneously. But I am glad to record the fact that during the pa:st year all branches of the work were fiuall.r orga11ized and in progress, so far as the reduced appropriations,.wonld Jlermit, aloug the Atlantic, Gulf, aml Padfic coasts, and in many of the interior States. These classes of work include the measurement of base Iiues; primary, secondary, and tertiary triangulation; astronomical determinations of azimuths and latitudes; determinations of telegrapllic differences of longitude; pendulum obser,·ations in the fit'ld; verification of stamlard:s of length : lines of leYel of precision to extend across the continent; s;p;tematic magnetie ohserYations, both on land and at s~a; inYestigations in relation to tl1e best signals for use at nigh9 in geodetic wurk; topographical work of seYeral claRses; simultaneous meteorological and magnetic observations on mountains uleven thousand feet high, and in \'alleys at their bases onl,y two hundred feet above the sea le,·e~; inshore, offshore, aud deep.sea h,Ydrogra11hy, including serial temperatures, current observations aud dredgings, in tlie study of the Gulf Stream; tidal obserrntions at poth permanent and u~mporary tidal stations; obserrntiom; of sea currents, other than the Gulf Strett.m; full tidal discussion by harmonic anals sis; observations relatiug to possible tidal or other periodic action of the earth's surface; obscn'atious relating t-0 possible change in the surface affecting primary poiut,8 of triangulation; publication of the Coast Pilot and charts, hand-books and manuals of the several classes of work; meteorological researches in reference to practical uses for the Coast Pilot; physical bydrography of rivers and l1arbors; discussion of eighteen Jrnudre<l miles of primary geodetic a.res in relatfon to the figure of the earth; the substitution of glass for metal in theodolite limbs; a.nd the planning of a general map of the United States founded on the most accurate geodetic, astronomical, bypsometric, and geographical data available. At first onl~· the most necessary classes of work were taken in band; as the work progressed others were added; some carried on continuously, others from time to time as 011portunities offered; but at no one time have all these classes of work beeu carried on simultaneously until the past year. The appropriations that were sufficieut when only a certain number of branches of work were in progress, a.re certainly not adequate·to keep them all in hand at the same, time aud h1t\·e tl1c Slll'Y<'Y carried on with an enm front, every part ~ming its llne propurtiou to tile whole. It is rnauifeist th&t economy and the best interests of tbf. 1mne;y rc1p1ire that no one patt, or a11y one class, he

It..,; oscillations of position, differences of Yelocity mouthly aml anuually, and iuerease of n>lnme north of Cape Cauaveral from thf' open sea, if any, are also to be determined. Congress ha,·ing partiaH~- proYided means, the wo1·k of outaiuiug data nuder the tirst. ti Ye ltea<ls wai; begun in 18i2 in the Gulf of )Iexico, by Lieut. Commander J. A. Howell, U. S. :x., Assistant Coast Survey, commanding successively the steamers Bache aud Blake. Howell successfull,y ran ;;;even hundred and forty miles of sounding linei,; from shore out to depths of twefre 1111111lred fathoms, by the old metlwds, obtaining the collateral data. Sir William Thomson's wire sounding apparatus llaving been successfully used in the Pacific in depths of forty-six hundred and tiftJ·-five fathoms by Comma11der George E. Belknap, U.S. N., '·ommauding steamet· Tuscarora, with impro\·elllents dedsecl by that officer, one set was obtained ;or use in l'C\~earcheR to he made by officers attad1ed to the Coast Survey. At this time Lieut. Com-· mmller Howell was trausforred to other duty. He was 1:mcceeded in the command of the Blake l)y Lieut. Commander C. D. Sigsbec, U.S. X., Assistant Coa.-st SurYey, and by that officer the deep-sea sonutliugi; (generally beyoud one huntlt'l'<l fatlwms and to depths of twenty-one hundred and fifty fathoms) of the whole Gulf of :\lexico were complete1l. He obtained :tt the same time fall data under the first five lieadings named. When Sig_sbee saw the Thomson wire soundiug apparatus he at once suggested important improyements, and devisec.t additional apparatus to relieve the strain on the wire during violent and rapi<l mm·ements of the Yessel.

An aggregate of forty stations wern occupied in t.hc conrse of. the year for determinations of magnetic deulina.tion or variation of the compas.-i at points in the region between "Wyoming Terri· tory and Yucatan, and inclnding ali.:o points on t.be shores of some of tl1e \Vest India Islands. The stations will be mentioned in the .'lf'Veral sections t-0 which I.hey lielong, between Sections VI and XVII, inelusi'rn. All previomi results in r(~gartl t~' magnetic doolination were embodied in the map i;;sued with m:v annual l'('}>ort for t11e. ;-,·ear 1876. The data since collecred verify the courses then drawn t-0 represent lines of equal magnetic variation, and with the observations now in poogress means will be afforded for extending the lines from north to south a.cross the Gulf of Mexico. Within the year a third edition wa,s issued of the paper by Assistant Charles A. Schott on the secular change to which the variation of the eompass neeclle is 1ml>jeet. This will meet a. demand

Bache, late ~uperintendeut of the work now under my direction, and hence the name by which the deceased was known through life. His phyl'lical constitution was apparently sufficient for any actiYe Rervice, hut was conjoined with a t~mperament peculiarly sensitive to changes, and especially RO to the efiect, on his system, of labor in the field.

Of the several otlice bra11ches, tlw h~tlrogrnpliic didsion hears near relation to arrangl'lllt'nt;;; for work done in the fiehl or artoat. Co11n11a111lt'r Edward P. Lull, lI. S. N., in charge of the diYisiou as hydrographic inspector, confers with the chiefa of parties wheu vessels are uectled, a11d hy his intimate acquaiutanee with details pertaiuing to hydrogrnph ic work, thP operation" of tl1c year ha,·e been greatly facilitated. As lieretofore, the original Lsdrographi<: sheets are carefully inspected iu this divi1o1ion, in a1h·ance of their reference to others for 1lrawi11g and eugTaYing. Last yoar the authorities of llollart College at GeueYa, N. Y., applied for a<hice iu regard to m<:>thods proper for a topogrnphical, h,vdrogn1phic, am! pl1~·sical SlllTe~· of the Seneca Lake baRiu, in which work it waR proposed to eugage members of the l'lophomore 01· junior class for a short period in each yl·ar, as a scliool of practice. A matter of such public utility being worthy of eucouragement, Assi8tant Hichard D. Cutts was re<1uested to coufer personally with President Hinsdale, and for that purpose st~journed two days in the spring of 1878 iu the Yicinity of the lake. A rapid reconnaissance was made, and the proper locatiou of a hase line wa8 indicated. Suggestions were also given in regard to stations for the needful triangnlation. In the emus<:> of the year, arrangements were completed at the college, stutlents were selectPd and a:o;signed, field w9rk was begun, and, wlieu sufficiently advanced, preparations WP.re made for undertaking work needful for constructing a chart of the lake. In May last Commander Lull passed four days with the ,;ophomorP class, attended hy Hamilton C. Smith, LL. D., and Prof. ,J. Towler, in llracti<-e with instrumeuts for locating poRitions, sounding, dredging, ol>fainiug water and bottom specimens at all depths, aml for plotting the re~mltR. 'l'he great depth of the lake: itR n1.i1s11al sources of suppl~'; the temperature of the water at diftere11t 8easo11s; au<l the Hpecialtieti of its famrn, will doubtless afford useful exercise under the direction of the profoRsorn who will he in immediate connection with this interPsting smTe,y. Ju the conrse of tlie year Coumnmtlt'r J,ull wa::; associated with hydrograpbic partil'.1' working at the entrance of Merrimac Hi Yer, and near Mount Desert lsland, and also with .-;pecial work in .Mississippi Uiver. 'l'he channels from 8ea at some of the barred harbors of our Atlantic coast, are so often chauge<.l in direction hy great storms, as to lessen the usefulness of tbe charts, but more especiall,y in crossing tbe bars. This fact is well known to navigat.ors, and in snclt ca!>es they depe11d upo11 the local pilots entirely for crossing the bars. Of conr:-:e the utility of the charts hohl:-i for all other purposes of commerce and uavigatiou at any one of the ports, the entrancc8 of which am ~o affected. SJmetimes, but not alwa.vs, the depth is maintained notwithstanding the change in position of the bar and channel. lu regard to :such ent.ra.nces it -is therefore of much interest that record should be made at least of the ,·al'iatious of depth at st,ate<l period,; throughout the year, if practicable, and· this, it wa.s judged, miglit be eftecte<l by tmgaging a single person residing at, eacl1 of the localities to report the condition of the bar once in each month, such conditions to be pub. lished iu certain dail.v commercial and local papers. Uudcr that dew, Lieut. Commander Philip H. Cooper, U.S. N., while attached to the survey, under my instructions visited all the harbors of which the bars were known to be subject to change, along the Atlantic seaboard. Full inquiry

at each made it certain that persons of sufficient intelligence could be engaged, but the allotment of means for the ordinary work of tbe year did not admit of completing the proposed arrangement. The suQ_ject is reserved for consideration when means are availatle, and in order to be of immediate use to navigators the results will be 1mblished without dela~-. On the 8th of November, lf\78, Lieutenant-Commander Cooper was 1letached from the survey, and then entered on special dnty required by tbe Navs Department. Lieut. H. E. Nichol,.,, U. 8. N., who had predously rendered acceptable service in the hydrographic division of the smTcy, was again asi;igned from the Navy Department, at my request, for <lut~- after his return from the Mediterranean, and rlljoined the office on the 1st of February. His readiness in details pertaining to cbarts, and to arrangements for the outfit and repair of vessels,· has greatlJ· assi8ted in the. dispatch of business connected with the division. After a yery active period extending beyond the term usually allowt~rl to officers for na,·al Sl'JTiee in the Coast a]l(l Geodetic Survey' J,ieut. Commander Charle8 n. Sigshee, lT. s. N., was rnlieverl on the 13th of November, 1878, from the command of the 8teamer Blake, and then entered upon dnt.r in the hydrographic office of the Nav~~ Departmeut. It is gratit~·ing to record of this accomplished officer that hi1' iugennity and aptitude in profeissiuual details" were enforced by energy ~.wd constant de\·otiou to the interests of the survey. Intelligent earnestness in securing accurate results, and steady determination equal to the greatest emergencies that, ba\·e yet arisen in bytlrographic operations, have added special value to the charts which lJear l1is name. In m,y preceding annual reports full mention has been made of the difficulties encountered in the l1jtlrogra.pliic development of the Gulf of Mexico, and of the successful eompletfo11 oft.hat work. The records were iutrusted to Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee, after his detachment, and tlie observations will be cli;;cussed by l1im under· permisfliou of the honorable Secretary of the Navy, for the publication of results from this office.

De.~ert 111la.nd.-The surface of this island is dirnrsitied by almost every variety of topographical details, and affords scenery which attracts m:my visit-0rs to the place as a resort Jn sumIIu:>r. Its harLors are convenient, and the.outline, the approaches aud views from the sea, a.rt~ such as to inviw all who have leisure for excursions afloat. During the i;ummer of each yt",ar the i:·lland will doubtless be as heretofore a point second in importance only to the interests whic11 cluster a.round a commercial center. This is true in refereuce to the whole area. Parties from the mainland pass along the eastern and western sides in steamers, enter Hollll'R Sound, land at points in the iuterior, traverse the islaml in carriage:o;, aud fiuaH~· reach landingt-1 from which the steamers take them to the mainland. The same facilities an1il for tbe inmates of man~· summer resiucucei; that are steadily increasing in uumber, aml thus all who resort to the place ma.Y in the course of a few hours enjoy the impressions due to association with lakei; and forests, mountains aud ra\·ines, the broad ocean bei11g in dew of the spectator while passing· m·er ground, picturesque by uature, aud now more enticing to the eye by successful cnlth-ation. Six separate mountains, al·eragiug upwarcls of twelYe huudred feet iu height, and i11 proximity a:;; many lakes, all consideralJly abo\·e the ocean level, are distinguishing features east and west of Somes Soul!d. The remainder of the insular area, which in all is about one hundred sqnarn miles, presents topographieal gradations that contrast agreealJly with the bold features of the middle zone of the iisland. On our eugraYed charts, Mount Desert Island is shown in detail, with the adjacent hydrograrh.r. For the selection of types of representation to l>e emb0<lied in the Topograpliical }fanual, .Mr. Edwin Hergesheimer was directed to make special examination of parts of the topographical survey, and to take views of the chara-0teristic features, and tha.t service was snccessfully performed in the course of the summer of 18i8. The eight sheets returuetl to t.he offiC!~ contain drawings of Eagle Cliff, Brown's Mountain, Echo Mountain, autl Robinson's Mountain. At the end oft.he fiscal y{lll,r he made arrangementis for adding to the material already gathered for the l\fannal, specimens characteristic of the topography of the Pacific Coast.

N., Assistant in the Uoast and Geo·letic Survey, working with the schooner Eagre. The pr~jection made to receive the somitlings included the space westward of Shwe Islaml and .Jordan's Island. At Har Harbor (Mount Desert faland), Uommarnler E. P. Lull, G". A. N., hydrographic inspector, joined the iiarty, and a1l\'ised iu regard to methods for prosecuting the work. After identifying points of the triangulation, signals were 8et np ou t.he island, and soundings were commenced. The hydrogn1phy from Bar Harbor includes t,J1e waterl:'I around the Porct1piue Island8, and also the ltarb01· between StaYe hland and the eastern side of Freucbmau's llay. During September tlie weatlier was generally fan>rahle, but in the mouth following wind;.;, rain, and cold greatly impeded the progrei'is of the work. The statistics are :

Haviug advanced the hydrography 80llle di8tauce uortl1warrl and westward of Swan Island, the vessels were moved to ::Xaskeag Barbor, Oil the 18th of October, 1878, aud soundings were prosecuted around Pond Island, to fill the upper vart of the pn~jection for work iu this quarter. As opportunity offered, 01te of the sounding parties was sP11t tn run tines over shoal spots previously developed by the party of Lieutenant Hawle,\' in Eggemoggi11 Heach, Jericho Bay, and Isle au Haut Ba_y. In se\'eral instances tlw l:ist soundings showPil that the shoals l1ad increased. Three ledges were developed in the l'Onro:e of these subsidiary operations: one, which has been named Thurlow's Rock, with eigl1t feet on it at mean low water, lwtween Green's Ilead aml Thurlow's Island; the second lies about a third of a mile northwe8t of Swan lRlarnl and Las been marked on the chart as Hanus' Ledge.

REPORT OF THE St!>ERINTENDENT OF THE

Assistant Mccorkle returned to Philadelphia on the 11th of November, 18i8. His work in ,that vicinity w-ill he mentioned under a separate head in Section II of this report. Re('onnai.~gance in rnm011t.-Between the work mentioned under the preceding head, and the triaugnlatiou H"l1ich hiclnues Lake Champlain and the valley of tbe Hudson, an inter,·al remained in whid1 110 point>< had liPe11 determined iirevions to the opening of the present fiscal year. This interYal embraces nearly all that 1)a!'t of the area of Vermont lying between the Connecticut River and the Gw·en Mountains. In due time as tlte work of triangulation advanced westw:m:l i11 .New Hampshire, the govl.'rnor of Vermont requested that the benefit of the lnw of Congress in regard to geographical pointi;; might be extended to that State, antl pr°'· is ion wal'! ma1lc accordingly. This application was tiled on foe 20tb. of July, ISiS. Prof. Y. G, Barbour, of the Unfrersit.y of Yermont, was mcommeude1l by the governor, mul also by the State gr·ologii;;t and faculty of the unirnrsity, a8 qualifiNl for the iichl operations, and was accordingly })laced in charge of tlrn work. HI.' conferred persomtlly with Assistant Richard n. Cntts, who wa,. eugagell at a primar~· 8tation in the vicinity, a.ntl commenced 1:econuaissam'e from the line Killington-Hawkes, early in September. After tl101·onghly examiuiug the country to the southward of ~utland, Pmfessor l~arbour 11rese11te<l a 11racticahlc sclwmc of triangulation. '!'bis, as most desirable, eonsists principally of qmulrilatemls, and extends southward from Jforrick 1\fonntaiu opposite to tlw south end of Lake Champlain. The southern limits of the scheme are at ]{rattkboro, on tbl.' ConneC'ticut, arnl Oreylol·k, a primary station in tlw w<·stern part of 1\fassachnsPtts. The monntaiu featnres of Yermont are well known. In prosecuting t.he reconnaissance the diffil.'ulty was, to avoid higlt mountains, as they are generally wooded and comparatively inaccessible; and in lieu of snch to select stations sufficiently eleyated to secure not only a go°'l scheme of work but economy in its execution. The sketch forwarded to tl1e office in October, witl1 the re1)0rt of J>rofessor Barbour, shows that he has successfully awomplished the preliminary work. Ry<lrograpliy of Merrimac River entra.nce, 11fass.-In order to develop changes known to hM'e taken place near the bar of .Merrimac River, a party was detailed under the charge of Lieut. Commarnler C. J\f. Chester, C. S . .N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, to make the needful examination. The steamer Bache with the party on board reached the entrance of the river on the 8th day of August, 1878. .At the outset, the hydrographic inspector, Commander E. 1~. Lull, U. S. N., personally examiJ:?-ed the place and advised in regard to the method JH'Oper for conducting the hyflrography. Hanges were erected on sl10re sixt;y yards apart, on an east and west bearing, and lines of R0tmdi11gs were run from the beach outward to depths of six. or seven fathoms. This work was 1lone by two parties, one conducted by Lieutenant-Commander Chester and Lieut. A. V. 'Wadhams; the other by I,ieut. Uriel Sebree and Master T. G. C. Salter. Tlie bar was fouud to be of coarse sand, shifting with gales, freshets, and strong tides, and marked by a succession of ridges and gullies. \Vhi1e soundings were in progress, the Outer Badger Rock was determined in position, hMing ouly senm feet of water on it, and also a ledge known as "Breaking Rock," about three miles to the northward of the bar, and half a mile from shore. For the adjustment of soundings, tidal observati<>ns were recorded at Black Rock Spindle, and al.-10 at a station on the north end of Pl nm Island, as near to the bar as the sea would permit. 'l'11e frequent changes at the bar of the Merrimac make it unsafe to enter at any time without a pilot. For the information of the light-house inspector of the district, Lieutenant-Commander Chester marked the best pmiition for the outer ra.uge light and gave suggeRtions for moving the outer and inner buoys.

Lieutenant-Commander Chester was conducting hydrograpldc work in tlle apprmt<'.l1es to 1luuut Desert Island, as already mentioned under a preceding head. Topography of Boston Harbor.-In my last annual report mention was made of the determiuation of points by triangulation, at the request of the board of harbor commissioners for the surwy of the upper harbor of Boston. :Means for the topographical surYey having been provilled by the city authorities, Assistant H. L. Whiting, at the request of the commissioners, was authorized to superYise the work. As the result of subsequent inspection, l\Ir. ·whiting remarks: "The accuracy and style of this surYey are of the firi,;t order, and the details miuut(~Jy rl·presentcd. These include the marginal ground between the outer faces of the wliaITes, awl the 1irist street bordering the general wharf line. ·within this spaee the outHnes of all structnn·s W!.'rP determined, and the character of each is expressed by a con veutioual sign, in wh:trHi; <lh;tingnislling betw!.',en pile work and solid filling, and in buildings dilstingnishing between wood all(l b!'ick or El!,?De. This marginal work embraces a large amount of detail, valuable in tlle stud~- mul treat mel1t of change and improvement in the harbor frontage." The results of this resurvey are on twelve full-sized plane-table sheets. El(·Yell of tlwm :ll'{' 011 ii scale of Ttoo, ttnd include l~ort Point Channel from Dover street bridge to its mouth: the South Boston sea walls and dock; the frontage of the city prop1;r; Charles Hin;r from tlIP 11a ,-yyard to "Test Boston bridge; Chelsea Creek from tlle u:lYy-yard to l\Ieridia11 i,;trnet awl Clwls1>a bridges, with all intermediate improyements; the south channel of l\lyi,;tic Hin'r: awl tl1e frontag·t.· of East Boston. The twelftlt sheet, on a scale of -" 1t;;,1, includes Charle8 ltiver or ( 'ambrillg-e H:rni11, from w· est Boston to Brookline bridge. 'l'his suney is ba;;ed 011 sixty-seYen point'! carefully (fotermiued by triangulation. The work was completed cal'ly iu ,1 auuary. Assistant ·whiting comlucted iu per.':>ou a plaue-tahle 11arty on t11e shorPs of Umh;on Hin·r, of which mention will be made in the next section of thit-1 rep01t. 8ea currents, Oulf of Ma,ine.-.As detailed in m~y last annual report, a 11nrnlJer of po:Jitious \H're occupied for the observation of sea currents along a line cur\·ing southward and eastward between Cape Sable and Nantucket Island. Four additional statiorns, in1licated as herl'toforc h~· ..it<sistant Henry Mitchell, were occupied in the course of the fiscal year by the same party, iu charg·c of )faster Robert Platt, U.S. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Surve.r, with t,he schooner Drift.. Other stations were att.empted, hut the n,ssel was forced away from her anchorage b,> had weathrr. ln the operations of this year the first position successfully occupied was iu the open sea ahout twcn tyfive miles southeast of Mount Desert Island. 1\lidway between the tin;t i,;tatiou and <Jape Sa\Jle, another position was occupied, aud a tltinl to the ;,;out1nvanl of Brnwn's Hauk, where similar ohsPrvations were made last year. To the westwanl of that Lauk, and in the Yicinity of ,·ery ltt'<ffY tide ri1)s, a fourth station was occupied. In· ea.ch case the i,;chooner wa1i brought to anchor, aml held while the currents were recortletl. The schooner remaine<l twenty-six hours at anchor in 100 fathoms at the fourth position. For some days the weather had been good, and the wind very moderate, but the sharp, irregular, and confused sea at the nip, was much like that found lal"t year when Master Platt was near the same station. Excepting 011 slack water, the Yessel rolled and pitched very badly. "bn the flood tide it seems to be made up of numerous small hrokeu rips with toppling sea, but on the ebb it is continuous. 1Vith great noise awl confusion the 8e<t rnus up and sometimes combs orer against the current as a breaker does he fore read1iu g shore in modt>ra k weather." Even in favorable weather the rip was extremely rough. Master Platt i,;ugg<'i,;ts thal it must be dangerous to small vessels during storms. Coasters and fisbermen aware of their roughness avoid the vicinity of the rips, and some European traders make the land as high up :ts ."\iouheg·aJJ Island, and from thence pass to the westward of the rough water. Master Platt was assisted in work in the Gulf of lfaine, b.r :Mates John Otkmlbal awl Harol1l Neilson. As bad weather was frequent after the completion of obsen-atious at the four i,;tatiuns, the party was recalled on the 8th of October. From Boston southward the passage was storm~-. l )ff Barnegat Master Platt was constrained t-0 turn back and aucbor inside of Saud~' Hook, aud agaiu at the Delaware Breakwater in consequence of a hurricane on the 22d of October, 18i.'-l.

After detention of two days at the Breakwater, )laster PlaU sailed for Xorfolk, and there the schooner was r<'fittetl for sen-ice which will be the 1mbjed of mention iu 8edio11 YIU of this report. The part;r on board the Drift while that YCS8el was becalmed off Hace Point, Cape Cod, saw "·ithin a few hundred yards of them what seemed to he a Yery largl' round spar prQjecting twelve to fift.een feet out. of the sea. In the course of three minutes the ol~i<·ct eurrnd and disappeared, hnt in half an bonr ag·ain appeared, at some distance on the opposite side of the Ycssel, pr~jecting as much as thirty-fiye feet above the water, and near it au oqject. ha Ying the form of au enormomi clorsal tin.

A ins to mi l'igation-In April last, Ass1stant .T. S. Bradfor(l ma<ll· a comprebeusi rn report in regard to change8 desirable in the po8itiom: of tlie buo,Ys then in place aloug the coast westward of Bo;;ton. His reeommt-mlations were communicated for the iuformation of the Light.-Hou8e Board. The report i-;pecifies iu each cai;e the precise po8ition to which 1he lmoy shouhl be moved. In this section the recommendations include the aids to ua\'lgation in the approaches to Chatham Ba,y and at Kill Pond Bar, in Kantucket Sound. Other suggestions in reganl to changPs of position wil1 be me11tio1wll in Section II of this report. A.tlantic Coast Pilot.-'Vhile the seoond l~uition of the Coast Pilot for the Gulf of l\Iaine was in progress, means were taken to embody in it <les«riptive notes of the more important changes which haYe occurred along the coast of Xew England since the issue of the first edition. As hcret-0fore, tlw work connecled with the publication remains in charge of .A8sistant .T. R. Rradfrird, and under hiis direction several localities were Yisited in October, 1878, by Mr. .John W. Parsons, for the purpose of noting the alterations ])roper for mention in the new edition. ~\t Newburyport, Mas8., record was made of prominent featm·es now presented in the approacl1e8 to that port by the recent erection of large hotels and other structures. It was noticed that the main channel had shifted in position, but without auy change in averag<· depth. l\fr. Parsons consultell with the be8t pilots, and carefully drew up sailing directions to suit the present. c011ditions for enteriug the harbor. A few change.s were obsen·ed at Gloucester, but the c·hart of Umt harbor in respect of a.ccurac;r is reganled hy the pilots as sufficient for all 1w1uirement1<. ~':l..t Salrm change8 in the appearance of the shores ha,-e takeu 11laee siuct~ thl~ first issue uf the ( 'oast l'ilot, dne mainly to the erection of numerous lmildiug,;, and in particular to the erection of the reform ;;cltool, a large rstrncture on ·winter IRland. Here, as at the places already noticed, the Hailing lines were tested, and the ranges for e11te1'ing were fonnd correct. At Lynn considerable changes wen'l t'ouml in the channels, increased depth haYing been gained hy frec111ent dredging. Alterations thu,; occasioned hy pri\·ate parties, include the cutting of a secoml channel from the vicinit,y of Sand Point to what is locally known as the Gas house wharf. As these operations ha.-e been pr-0secuted since tlw co1111)letio11 of tlie hydrographic suryey, the chart merely represents the contlitiou of the harbor as it formerly existed. Before leaving the section a 8hoal "ith twelre feet at low water, and known as Cliff Ledge \Vas marked in approximate 1msitiou on a copy of the engraYed chart.

Parsons haye been used hy Assistant Bradford in the revision of the Yolume, the issue of which mas be expected soon after Urn close of the fiscal year to which this report corresponds. Tidal obs<'rmtion.s.-In t11e autumn of 1878 a systematic examination was begun of the tides of .Buzzard's llay. :Assistant Henry Mitchell selected positions at which recol'lls were desirable, and Mr. C. H. Van Orden was assigned to make arrangements for the observations. By himself and others teu stations were ooeupied. At the two outside stations (lHoek Island and Clarke's Point) Relf-registering gange.'i were used for periods of about three months. The other stations w~

Geodetic operntions.-In pursuance of the scheme of triangulation for connecting the survey of Lake Champlain with that of tlw Atlantic coai;t, Assistant Hichard D. Cutts compl<'ted arrangements for field work late in .r nne, 18i8, aml occ11pii>d Prospect 11ountain, a station about twent:r miles to the southward aml westwanl of the soutl1 e11t1 of tlie lake. lustr111neuts were i1romptly set in place and adjusted for ddermilmtions of tiwt-, azinmtli, am! latitude, as well al'l for the measurement of horizontal and vertical angles, but during a.u entire mouth the region north aud l'lonth of the station was em·eloped ill smoke from the uurning foreists in Xortltern ~ew York. The ontlying signals of the triaugnlatiou were in Yiew oul~' once preceding the 20tli of .Jul.'·· After that date the <lrnwbaek lessened, aud the re<JUisite obsern1tio11s were completed h;y the 2!1th of August. To provide for the J'eady occupation of Killington Station to the eastward of the :,;;outh end of Lake Champlain, Assistant Cu tt.s stored liis camp fixtures aml iustrnments at Hutland, reserdug only the theodolite and observing tent for occup~·ing l\Jount ::\louadnock, in New Hampshire. The sea.son proved to be unfaxorable, and for days in sncressiou that summit, was em-eloped in fog, but the chief of the party arnl his aid, Mr. C. IL Siuclah', watched patiently nntil the close of September, and finally COID})leted the recof(l of horizontal anglrs. The length of the lines obser,·ed in the course of the season Ya1'ie'1 from thirt.v-sen·u to sixty. three miles. On Prospect l\Ionntain horizontal angles were measnred b.r means of heliotropes stationed at Helderberg, Greylock, Killington~ anll Potato Bill. 'Yhile at )foua<l11oek heliotrope:;; were observed on at ~lmrnt Tom, Gre;\-lock, and )lonnt I~qainox. The horizontal augle;.; were det~r mined by se"\"en hundred and eigl1ty-four poiutings, and the rertical b~- one hundred arnl eiglity-th"e don ble-zeIIit11 di1itances. Besides the usual ohscnatio11s for <lctermi11ing local tiUH', :uicl the ,-ahw of Sl':lle tli\·isions of tlrn level and micromekr, the latitude at Prospect was dmlnced from one lmndre<l ancl twenty-eight observations on twenty-six pairs of stars. For azimuth, two hnn1lre1l and Stffenty-two obse1TationR were made on PolariR at a111l near it,s eastt"rn elongation. The records of the field work in elen~n volumei,; have hee11 1luplicated and placctl in tlw officf'. Before lea Ying the section an examination was ma.Ile of the region along the west side· of l1ake Champlain for selecting a station near Plattsburg to perfect the gemfotic co1111eetion het1n'Hll the primary triangulation and that of the lake. After his.return to the office, Assistant Cutti-: computed and turned in the results of l1is field ohsen·atiow; for triangulation, latitude, azimuth, and local time.

In the course of the following three weekR all the approaches to the island were carefully sounded to the distance of one mile off shore, and the results are given on two hydrographic aJieets. On a third sheet, Lieuten;i.nt-Commander Chester r>lotted the soundings made in the

R.EPORT OF THE SUl'ERU\TENDENT O:F THE

course of a close survey of Southwest Ledge. The following remarks are taken from the con· eluding report of that officer: "The southern and southwesterl'I shores parUcularly are i:;tuddeu with large bowluers, man;r of them entirely below the surface, making it extremely hazardous to approach nearer thau half a mile from the lan<l. Ily inquiry it appeared that most of the acciuents hare occurred on the southwest coast an1l in foggy weather, the strong title from the sound forcing ressels on the isla.nu. Owing to the rocky nature of the bottom only a small proportion of the wrecks get off again even iu smooU1 weather. "'Vith a chart, careful leadsmen can know when they are nearing this part of Block Island, as Southwest Ledge is joined to the island by a ridge with eight or nine fathoms of water. This ridge is steep-t-0 on its northern side, and shoals gradually on its southern side. ''The breakwater now in course of construction on the east eoast of :Block Island makes a sung little harbor for small ,-essels during a southeast gale of wind, lmt with wind to northward of eastnortheast heavy sea sets in, making it dangerous to remain near for auy vessel that cannot enter the basin. "The basin, about one hundred yards square, is dredged out to seven feet at mean low water, and in it 8mall vessels can lie in almost any weather. ''To the northward of the breakwater vessels may anchor, protected from westerly winds in fi rn and six fathomR of water; hard, sandy bottom. 'l'hc best anchorage, 110"·ever, is on the west side of Lile islaml, abreast of low land adjoining the salt ponds, where in eight or nine fathorus a soft clay mixed with sand makes very good holding ground." :For the aJjustment of soundings the tides were obscnTed at a station on the west side of the basin, east coast of Block Island.

The party was subsequently engaged in Sections I, VI, and VIII. .A idg to narigation.-After personal examination, Assistant J. S. Bradfonl reported in April last Uw changes desirable in the positions of buo_)·s that heret-0fore have served as aids in coast navigation between Boston aIHl ~ew York. Thirty-four separate localities were examined. The rPcomme111lations iudicate iu each instance the exaet position to which the buoys should be moyed so as to be most effective in aiding the naYigator. In this S(iction the entire sailing course was carofnlly followed through IJong Island Sound, and continuously by the way of New York up the Hudson Rh-er to Troy. The changes deemed expedient ha\'e been made known to the Light-House Board. Surrey of Jamaica Bay, N. Y.-Field opemtions for this survey were resumed early in .July, 1878, by Assistant J. \V. Donn, who extended eastward his triangulation work of the preceding year. Additional points were determined to the eastward to include Far Rockaway, and also the head of the bay. The shore lines were tra.ced as rapidly as possible, and results were f'urnisbec1 for the use of the hydrogra1}hic party. In its progress the surrny by Mr. Donn was made so as to show the changes that have taken place, especially in front of Far Rockaway. At Rockaway Inlet the shore was resur\Teyed, proyiug that a retrograde mo\·eruent had oecurred in the course of the year. This, however, is regarded as temporary. Assistaut Donn reports that the inlet is surely moving westward, and at a considerable rate. "The small sandy island called Duck"Bar, by recent accretions is now abo,·e the mean high-water level, and lies nearly due south of the east end of Manhattan Beach. During the summer of 1877 no part of it was .visible at mean high water. The point. of the beach has receded abont three hundred meters, but very shoal water extends as far into the inlet as the high-water line of last year. "The shore line of the beach from the point at which the survey was begun in the present year, and on as far as the site of the hotels, has suffered little by abrasion or scour, notwithst.anding the fact that the sea swept over it in many places during the storm of January, 1879.

Hydt·ography of Jamaica Bay, N. r.-Soundings were commence.cl in the eastern part of ,Jamaica Bay on the 14th of August, 1878, by Lieut. ,V. I. Moore, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Surrey, with a party on board the schooner Ready. The requisite shore Jine was furnished by Assistant Donn, of whose work mention was made under the preceding· head. Lieutenant Moore at the outset of work established a fafo-gange on the wharf in front of the Holland Honse, on the south side of the bay, at a point nearly midway of the spaee to be inclnded in soundings. After joining properly with the 11,nlrograph~- done b_v Lienternmt 1\fa_vnard in the summer of 187i, the sonrnlings were extende1l to inclmle tlw eastern part of thr bar. The lines W('re run genemll:· at high water, a111l were crossed uy others for deYeloping the channels. "In the channels of the eastern part of ,Jamaica Bay the bottom was found to be uniformly hard sand. In the small passages, or in deep water cnt off by liars, the hottom is soft, black mm.I, probably washings of the peat formation of the marsh islands."

Tidal observations.-Observatious with the self-registering tide-gauge at Governor's Island, iu New Yor!' Harbor, were kept up by Mr. R. T. Bassett until the 1st of May, 18W, when the series was brought to a close, fair observations having been recorded continuousl;y for a period of nineteen years. The occasional breaks in the record were ca~ISed by ice in extremely cold weather, lmt that inconvenience in late years was generally overcome by the free use of hot water. The self-registering gauge was first started at Governor's Island in 1852. Owing to the difficulty of keeping it in opocation during cold winters, the series of continuous obserrntions was not begun unt.il the year 18GO, but since that date the series ha11 been well maintained. The records are of great value, and will be subject to further discussion. At Sandy Hook a well-furnished self-registering tide-gauge was put up in October, 18i5, 011 one of the wharves of the New Jersey Southern Railroad. Since tl1at date the record hwi been kept up by Mr. J. W. Banford with success. The best position was selected for the gauge, yet the water is sometimes very rough, and causes rapid wear in the working parts of the apparatus. As might be expected, the tides at this })lace when great storms are raging are much affected by tlrn wiml. Topography of Hud~on River, N. Y.-In continuation of the detailed snrwy of the slton·s of the Hudson, Assistant H. L. Whiting took the field early in the fiscal year, and prosecuted the work northward from the limits reached in the previous season near Peekskill. Two sheets were filled in the course of the season preceding the 1st of Decemher, 18i8, representing the topographir~a1 details of the east hank of the river. The survey was c~rried iuland to the best practicable boumlary, and includes the characteristic features of the valley of the Hudson between the wot·king limits. The headlands known as Sugar Loaf and Ant.hony's Nose are shown on the map of the

present year. The locality included in this survey is of peculiar interest; many difficulties offer in its ad-

vance, but it is nevertheless desirable that the work shoulcl he done with precision. In alhtding to the topographical features, l\Ir. Whiting remarks: "Most of the hill-sides and summits are thickl,v wooded with trees common to the latitude arnl soil-oaks, chestnut, hickory, maple, hirch, &c., with some pines and ce1lars, the deciduous trees being the characteristic growth. Mon~ment with instruments was much impeded and obsenTations rendered difficult, the summits being as inaccessible as the valleys and ra-vines. Changes in contour are abrupt, and the feat.mes of such magnitude that no system for generalization can be assumed. It became neces1mry, therefore, not only to go o\·er all the ground, but to record observations and measurement.R muler difficulties which made the progress of the 8UrYP,V laboriom; and slow." As the historical interest arnl general importance of this particula,r section of topography call for the ntmost'that can be uone in the way of delineation, Mr. "'biting spare1l no effort. The results of his work will meet all possible rnquirements. Bxpedients suggested by his experie11ce in the fteld, bnt not commonly employed, were brought int-0 requisition when it became apparent that ordinary methods, carried of nece8sity in this case li<1yoml controlling points, would involve errors in position and in detail.

Gerdes examine<! the vicinity of eight stations of the secondary triangulation of the coast of ~ew Jersey. These were occupied many years ago, and ground markR had been set sufficient for the time, tlle advance of improvement beiug slow. But here and elsewhere along the coast the surface of the ground ha:; been materially cl1anged in recent years. Knolls and elevations on which signals once Rtootl ha,·e been levelled, the ground thus couyerted has heen planted in corn, and in some cases no trace remains of points formerly marked and occupied by tbe theo(lolite. Such change;;; were to be expectea; hence, at the outset, range minks were set at some distance from the triangulation point, and so described iu the record as to admit of ww in idt>nti(\'ing the position, e-ven after the remm·al of the original ground surface. Five of the stations visit,ecl were i1lentifi.ed by Mr. Gerdes, three in the upper part of New Jersey, at Bound Brook, Bloornll.eld, and Throckmorton, and two in the vicinity of Cape l\fay, at Baird and Learning"s Point. At the former station, Chew, it was made eYident by outlying range mark8 that thP hill on w hic11 the tlieollolite stood has heen levelled, and a turnpike now 11as1ms oYer the site.

I, 326 During the winter of' 1878-'79 the movement of ice in the Delaware was closely examined hy Assist;ant McCorkle along the stretch of river from Bridesburg, above Philadelphia, to Fort Miftii11, below the city. After completing his observations, the courses taken by the floating ice both on the flood a.nd on the ebb tide were traced on charts. It was noticed that between Greenwich Point and the Horse Shoe, and also immediately opposite to the Horse Shoe, the tendency of the ice wa,., to pack on both tides, but below the old navy yard the ice packed mostly on the flood tide. TbP ebb deposited ice opposite Gloucester, N .·T., an·l the flood above and below on the same sitfo of the river. During \he winter the channel wa.'J generally free of ice abreast of League Island, hut ftoa.ting ice packed on the flood. at Fort Mifflin. Opposite to Philadelphia the ice when moving with the flood tide kept a course along the city whan·es, but on the ebb the ice left the main channel near the upper end of Smith's Island, ancl passed down in the ea.filtern channel miclway between the island e.nd the Camden wharves.

S. Peirce. .Flexnr(~, as a source of error in the orcliua.ry support used for pendulum experiments, aud the possibilit;\· of allowing for t111i error, as suggested by him iu 1875, are now allmittecl by European obser~ers to he essentials for l'lll\C('ss in the investiga.tion. Mr. Peirce says: "There still remains a question in regard to the difference between the tlexm·e under a forc1~ applied continuously and under one intermittent like tlta.t caused by a swingin~ pendnlnrn. Experiment.8 at Hobo-ken, N. J., show that this difference is large upon a woo<len support, lint "insignificant upon a metallic support." In a. mathematical analysis published in the "Proceedings of the American .Academy or Arts and Sciences," Assistant Peirce has shown that any difference between the statical and dynamkal fle:11100 which could po!!ISibly ha.ve an a11prcciable effect on the time of oscillation of the penclulum, would largely increase the rate of decrement of the am}llitude of oscillation. He remarks fnrth<·r: "No considerable eft'ect of' this sort exists, tlte rate of decrement being almost exactl.Y th(' same upon the Repsohl tripod that it is npou anotl1er support of much greater stiffness. But, alt.hough the di«'erenee betw~ the irt;Q,tical and dynamical tle:u1re will be yery small when good

judgment has been usetl in u10uutiug the pt·ndulum, the correction for fiexurc remaius a source of anxiety and trouble in making the experiments. l·'or this reason a careful mathematical study has heeu made of the method of avoiding the difficult~·, as proposed lly 1\1. I<'aye, which consists in swingiug two similar pendulums sinmltaueom,;ly on the same support, with e·1nal amplitudes of vst·illation, lmt opposite phases." The yfows of Assistant Peirce in this connection are fully set forth in his pa11cr ou l"ase's method, communicated to the American Jomual of Science. The concluding report of the season mentions, as a spechil difficulty in determiuiug gravity, the uncertain effect of the wearing anu blunting of the knife edge uvon which the iiemlulnm rests, and of its motion upon the plane which supports it. Experimental in\'estiga.tions of these subjects ha,·e already been undertaken, and will be fnl'ther prosecuted in the course of the coming year. The acceleration of gravity has been accurately measured by Assistant Peirce, at the Alleghany Observatory in Pennsylvania. Stations on the mountains in that i:-;tate will be occupied in successio11, as means for estimating the disturbing· effel'.t of the mass of the Appalachians on results for latitude, longitude, aud a.zinmth. Ju geuc>ral reference to researches for completing U1e i:;pectnuu meter, ~\s:-;i;.;taut Peirce tlms remarks: "01H· of the difticultiel'i iu the measm·erncnt of graYity is the circumstance that metallic bars, hitherto our ult,imate standards of length, prohalJly change iu length in t.he course of :years. The l'onfn:;iou into whieh such spontaneous cbaug·es in stamlartls of length may throw all vreci:;c meas11rements rtiforre<l to them, is too obvious to be insisted upou. Hence search has been made for a h'ugth in nature which should be more strictly invariable than that of a metallic bar." The idea that a wave length of light would be more invariable than any substantial memmre has been entertained by sernral distinguished physicists, such as Arago and Clarke :Maxwell, but tlleir suggestions are to be regarded as purely speculatirn. 'L'he means of -comparing with great Jll'Ccision a wave length of light with a tangible object were not known when the sugges.tions were recorded. In reference to the basis for his subse<1uent development of the idea, Assistant Peirce thus observes: "It was not uutil our ingenious countryman Lewis }I. Uutherfurd, b;r variouis mechanical achicwments, and especially by his manufacture of diffraction plates of extreme accuracy, had made the attempt practicable, that any one could seriouslJ· propose to measure a warn length to 011e-rnillionth part of its own length. ··The length of the wave tlepends, first, 011 the iuternal constitution of the chemical atoms of t lw sttllstance which gives rise to the spectral line, and this we ham reason to believe the most unalterable thing known in nature; seconlll;v, on the densit,\· aud elaRticity of the luminiferous ether as it exists iu Yacuo; aucl though we have as yet no positire information in regard to the inalterability of these qualities, we have reason to suppose that they are free from influences whfoh cause the s11ontaneons alterations of metallic bars." The matter must necessarily remain tentative, but the end sought ii; well brought out in the results. After many essa,ys Mr. Peirce succeeded in manufacturing in .Mr. Rutherford's laboratory, with the aid of his trained assistant, :l\-Ir. D. C. Chapman, a comparator by which a diffraction plate or one centimeter width has been compared with each one of a decimeter scale of centimeters accu· raJely to the one-millionth part of a centimeter. The fnrtlier comparison of the decimeter with each one of a meter scale of decimeters has been commenced but not conclmled. The ot11er part of the investigation, to compare the waye length of light with the breadth of the difl'raction plate, has been successfully accomplished by means of a spectrometer of orif,rinal construction, IJrovided with a circle divided upon glass, after Mr. Rutherfurd's design. In studying the various sources of error in measurements of the deviation of a line in the dif· fraction spectrum, Assistant Peirce observed the supplementary images, commonly called "ghost-I!!," due to irregularities in ruling the lines. These he found to be an entirely new speciea of diffraction J·henomena, and tha,t instead of their position depending on lihe amount of irregularity in the ruling, as had been commonly supposed, only their brightness depends upon this, while their position depends solely on the period of the inequality. After confirming his mathematical analysis of the sab.jeet by carefiµ angular and photometric measurements, Mr. Peirce preseuted the results in a Il!emoif which was read. at tpe last mi:ieting of the National Academy of Sciences,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

Recently, inquiries on the subject were renewed by the United States Fish Commissioner, Prof. S. F. Baird, with reference to the adoption of snch means as might be practica.hle for preservingtl1e supply of fornl-pro<luciug mollusks in Chesa})Cak(" llay, aud as all needful appliances were at hand the in\·estigation desire(l l)y the Commissioner w~ promptly unrlertaken. The work was committed to Master Francis \Vinslow, U.S. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, with a party in the schooner Palinurus. Earl.\- in Angnst, 18781 Master "\:Yiwslow cxaminetl the oystt·r h<·tfa i11 the ,Tames Ri\'et from Sewall's Point upwards, ai11l clol'.let1 inYestiga.tion i11 that rinir on tlle 171.h aft(lr tmnm-1ing forty miles of existing heels. During the 1>1tnmgth of the title, cnrrtmt ol>serv1~tio11s wen· recurifod at th{· separate beds, and specimens of water were taken at different tleptlit; for amilysi8. The tem1wratllre of the water was carefully noted. The latter part of August was employetl by the party in Tangier Sound. Many specimens were taken of dift''erent ages, some from ·each bed or "rock," as the' mass is termed by the local oystermen, and with the living mollusks specimens of the bottom on wbicl1 they were fotind. Over each "rock" the current was me.asured as nearly as possible at half flood and ebb. A1l the beds were marked on copies of the engraved chart, and traverse lines of soundings were nm to de\"elop the locality, the proceeding at each being like that conducted in reconnaissance about a shoal. Subsequently the oyster reef:; in Pocomoke Sound were examined and mapped as in the localities already referred to. B,r the schooner, and her boats, upwards of nine hundred stations were occupied for determining positions, and eight hundred and fourteen miles were run in sounding. The records show five hundred and seventy.fixe observations for temperatnre, and four hundred and twelve specimens of bottom were preserved. The dredge was u11ed :in depths varying from twelve fathoms t:-0 as little as eight feet. Master R. R. Barron, G. 8. N., was attached to the Pa.Iinurw;, and effectiYel;r assisted in the investigations. In his concluding report, Master Winslow cordially mentions his obligations to Mr. T. S. Hodson, collector, and )Ir.·J. E. Sterling, postmaster at Crisfield, for their kindness, and for suggestions that facilitated the work in many way~. Mr. T. B. Ferg-uson, of the Maryland Fish Commission, futthered the im·estigations, and Mr. H.J. Rice garn direct assistane~ in the details and valuable suggestions for prosecuting the work. The informatfon gathered by Master \'Vinslow >l'iH be placed at the disposal of tlie United Stats Commissioner on Fish and Fisheries. )!asters 'Vinslow and BarroH were subsequently engagetl in hydrograpbic work, notice of which will be taken in the next section iu this report. Tidal ohserrt1tion.~.-The serieR of tidal obst>rvati<ms continued for many ~·ears at Furt Monroe, Va., with lt oolf-regisroriug gauge, was clo11ed in Jul;r, 18i8. l'he observations will in time be thoroughly discussed by the method most suita-ble for a continuous record of many ;rears. S11Yrey of James Rii·er, Va.-Field work for the (letailed survey of the river between City Point aud Dutch Gap was resumed b;r Assistant J. \V. Donn early in November, 1878, his party using, a.s beret.afore, the schooner Scoresby. Above the Gap, signals were set up for extending the sur,,ey to Ihchmond and Manchester, and computations were made of the points requisite for the planetable work. .As opportunity offered, tlle stations were occupied with the theodolite, and angular measurements were made on spires and objects in Richmond for connecting with points used in the early survey of tbe riYer. The markings of the base line of that survey were sought for, but have not yet been itlent.ified. Thorough examination will be made in the course of the ensuing season when the party wUI again be a.t ~fanchester, a.ml it is deemed probable that the ground-marks may yet be recovered. The topographical surrey was adrnnced to a lWJiut a.hoiit tixe miles below Richmond, and includes inft.etail the jettees an1l ot.her works of the James Uiver Improvement Company. Owing to restriction in the means for work and the necessity of maintaining parties on stretches of the coast not previously developed~ it was found inexpedient to continue the survey in the vicinity of Rich· mon<l. The. detailed survey, including tbe hydrograpby, will, however, be extended up to that city in the course of the ensuing season. Geodetic oonnection in Virginia.-After completing the chain of quadrilaterals along the Blue Ridge between Harper's Ferry and tbe base line at Atlanta, reconnaissance w!WI made for stations by wbieh a similar chaia might be e:xtooded from the headwaters of the Rappahannock we8tW'atd

to the Ohio River.

Some of the stations having been selected aml marked by signals in the usual

way, Assistant A. T. Mosman rook the field on the 20th of April, 1878, and occupie.d Humpback
Mountain, and in succession, in the c,ourse of the present fiscal year, four other primary stations in comwction with it to the westward. Three of the points occupied are upward8 of fort~·-thrPe lrnudred feet above the sea level. In addition to angular mea:mrements requisite for t11e geodetit' connection, twenty-four mountains of the Blue Ridge, Great North Mountains, and the main Alleghany range were determined in approximate position and elevation. Tweke of these peak81 mostly at the headwat~rs of the Potomac, James, and Kanawha Rivers, are more than four thousand feet above the sea. Mr. Mosman also included, by proper measurements, the astronomical station occupied at Staunton, Ya., in 1866; and incidentally traced a meridiau line two miles in length near that city. As usual, the ends of the line were marked by stone posts. After completing work at Humpback, the twenty-inP-h theodolite was used in succession at Elliott's Knob, Bald Knob, Paddy's Knob, and State Springs, the last-named station being some miles to the northward and westward of Harrisonburg. Three secondary stations were occupied in the vicinity of l::ltaunton. At Elliott's Knob, azimuth was determined by two hundred and forty-five observations on Polaris. For"time, forty-two stars were obsen'e1l on ten nig·ht:-1; and for latitude one hundred and eighty-nine obRer\'atious were recorded with twenty-three pairs of star:oi on eighteen nights. All the points observed on from the four primary positions occupied within the fiscal year were determined in height by the measurement of vertical angles. Observations were completed at Elliott's Knob on the Gth of August.. llaltl Knob was occupied a few days after, but of necessity the camp of the party was 8ixtel'n lmndreil feet below the 1mmmit, as no water could be found near the station. Paddy's Knob was occupied early iu October, and State Springs later in the same mouth, Both are difficult of access and distant from an,\- roa<l. The party put up log cabins for shelter, ancl occupied them while the obserYations were iu progTeS8. TTp to the middle of October the weather was such as to admit of rapid progress, but observations were interrupted by a Yiolent storm of wind, hail, and snow, continuing four days after the 17th of tliat month. During two days tlie temperature was below freezing. ObAernt.tions at Padd,r's Knob were finaUy completed ou the 24th of October, and the measurements at St~.t"' Spriugs 011 the hit of Nornmher, 1878, the temperature for som('; days previous heiug as l<lw as t:)O Fah., with a st1·011g wind. The secondary work at Staunton was completed early in ~ol\'ember and gave clata for determiu. ing the position of the court-house, and other public buildings, as well as fo1· c.,-ounecting the a>itm· nomical station with the primary triangulation.

Assistant Mosman, at the end of the .fiscal year, ma.de arrangements for occupying stations near the headwaters of the Kanawl1a Rinr for extcmling the geodetic connection westwarll towards the Ohio. Oe<>ietic le11els.-Me.n.tion was made in my report of last year that a line of levels of pr<>cision had been st.arted westward from Hagerstown, )[d., and run towards the Ohio River, and that work on the line was :resumed by.Subassistant Andrew Braid in May, 1878. After testing the work previm.tsly done, the line was extemlec.l westward with the geodesic micrometer lm-el, No. 1. At the office the constants of the instrument were carefully determined, and in the course of operations in tltc field have been verified. Instead of working in opposite directions, two lines were ruu simultaneously, and generally the rods were at difterent dLtances from the instrument. The record of each rod is a complete line, so that it is unneoossa.ry t-0 apply any correction for difference of zero poiuts of their scales. A.s the work advanced, two orders of permanent bench-marks were used, the primary being specially distinguished from the secondary. The first primary was marked on the court house in

'kEPORT OF THE SUPERtNTENDE:ST OF THE Hagerstown, and the last of the working season on the pier of the bridge across the liockhocking River, at Atl1ens, Ohio, where llfr. Braid closed operations in December, after including an aggre· gate lengt,h of three hundred and thirty-five miles in operations with the levelling instrument. Sixteen primary bench-marks were inscribed for future identification, and fifty secondar;r ones. Temporary hcnch-marks were set at three hundred and seventy positions on the line. In the main the weather was favorable, but duriug NoYember and December the work was carded on under many disadvantages. In the middle of the last-nametl month the party was disbanded. Mr. Braid then returned to "\Vashington and entered upon the computation iucident to his field operations. These involve great labor, due to t111~ 11rocpsse11, and clwcks fon11d needful for securing· ae<>ura,cy in t11e observations. At the close of the fi;;ral ~~f'ar, Subassistant Braid agaiu took the field, to a<hance the geodetic leveliug westward of Athem>1. In 111,v next anunal report, this work will he referred to nnder tbe lwad of Section XIV. Life-saving stations.-In the course of the fiscal year tlw position.~ of a nmnher of stations of the Life-Saving SerYice were di~termined Ly .Assistant F. IT. Gerdes. On the coast of X orth Carolina Ile took the field in .June, 1878, and again in October, and proceeded northward t-0wards Cape Henry. Most of the stations being in Section IV, the work done in that service will be describt>Al in the next chapter of tbif! rt>port. The occupation of l\fr. Gerdes in the summer of 1818 has heen mentioned il1 Section II.

I.A/esal'ing sf,<1-tions.-In preceding seasons the stations of the J,ife-Saving Service have been determined in position, and marked on the original plane-table sheets of the survey of the Atlantic coast from the northeastern boundary as far south as Cape Henry, on the coa8t of Virginia. Some of the engraved chart plates have been already marked with the positions, and all others will be when charts are iRsucd in future. Of the ten stations between. Cape Henry and Cape Hatteras, eigbt, were marked in position last year by Assistant F. H. Oerdes. The serYice was re1mmed early in ,June of the present year, and the two remaining stations, Chicomicomico and Little Kinnakeet, were determined and recorded for office use in marking the charts. }'or the same district Congress appropriated means for thirteen additional life-saving stations, hut 1\iI r. Gerde8 found that Yery few of the localities were selected, and that the construction of station-houses had not been commenced Pending the aetion towards that end, he therefore returned to Washington, and after due prepara· tion took the field for other duty, of which mention ha-s hoon matfo in Section II of this report. Early in October Assistant Gerdes again proceeded to North Carolina. In Albemarle Sound tbe use of the T:nited States Revenue Marine sloop Saville was courteonsly offered by Lieut. Walter "\Yalton, and with the co-operation of tliat officer the work of determining positions was resumed. finding that the Oregon Inlet station had been mo>e<l southward on account of sea washings, :Mr. Herdes carefully determined the new position, and two others, which had been in his temporary absence from the section decided upon near Bodie's Island Jight-honse. The buildings were then in progress at Pea Island and Tonm1y's Hammock, and for cha,rt purposes were located by angular measmements from adjacent trigonometrical stations. At the ne"r stations, Hatteras aml Creed's Hill, four posts were set by officers of the Life-SaYing Service to mark the intende,d locations, but the erection of the buildings had not been begun. The positions of the post were determined b~· reference to known points. While engaged in this service the Saville weathered in Pam1)lico Sound a lmrricane of seven hours' duration. At Cape Hatteras the velocity of the wind was eighty miles per hour, and by its force a vessel was cast ashore :tll(l totally WTeeked at a position only a few miles from that of the littfo revenue sloop. When the weather moderated, Lieutenant ·walton sailed outside and Mr. Gerdes rook angles and bearings for marking the position at Big Kinnakeet, where the foundation of a lite-saving station had been laid out. At Cedar Hammock the house was finished, though not then occupied, and fixed in position by reference to trigonometrical points. The passage to Currituck Sound was boisoorous, but the

Jlarty safely anchored in Kittyhawk Bay, and in that vicinity two new stations, known as Kill Devil Hill and Gamel's Hill, were located in poRition by reliable observations. .At Caffrey's Inlet Assistant Gerdes left the vessel and tra\elled north ward sixty miles along tl1e beach, accompanied by I,ieutenant Y'i'alton, who had official business at several stations in the direction towards Xorfolk. On reaching the new station, Poynes Hill, Mr. Gerdes made needful measurements for marking its position on the chart.. At Currituck light·house he was detained several days b~· stormy weather, but as soon as practicable visited the stations at Old Curritu<:k 1nlet and Deal Island and ascertained their positions by good observations. SeYere weather delayed operations two days, during which the party remained at the olll station lwuse, False CaJle, but then passed on without further delay. Little Island station had been ma1·ked by four posts for the site of the building, but after diligent search, in which Lieutenant Walton pe1·sonally assisted, the posts could not be found. As a dense fog prevailed at the time, a sketch was left with Lieutenant Walton, who subsequently measured the necessary augles and forwarded the llata to 1\Ir. Gerdes. The last of the new life-saving stationfl determined in position was Seatack, about ftve miles below Cape Henry. From the site of tlte iutendell building (marked as in other cases merel.Y by four posts) no permanent OQject waR visible, and of neces>1ity the location was approximately fixed by reference to tbe topographical sheet. In connectio11 with the work here described Assistant Gerdes examined tlte ground marks of six of the principal triangulation points in this section, and also the marks at the ends of the base line on Rodie's Island. Additional marks were set where they seemed to be required for ready identification in future. Before taking the field for service on the eoast. of YirginiaandNorth Carolina, l\Ir. Gertles ~s furnished at the office of the Life-Saving Service with notes and i·eferences to aid in his moYements from station to station along the coast. The Superintendent of that service, S. I. Kimball, afforded all the facilities in his power to further the work. Assistant Gerdes closed operations on the coast of Virginia on the 29th of November, 18i8. After his return to the office the results of his obser vations were adjusted and applied to the original sheets. The life-saying stations thus determined in position will be marked on the engraved charts without delay. Atlantic Ooast Pilot.-I11 continuation of his work of last. year, whil'h was confined to dl:'scriptions of the onter coast of the Southem States, I,ient. Frederick Collins, r. S.S., AsRistant in the (Joast and Heodetic Snrvf'y, with a. party in the schooner l'aliunrns, sailed from Balti11101·p on the 21st of October, a.ml in the com·se of the following six weeks exami11ed all points of interest to naYigators in Albemarle and Pamplico Sounds, including the t.rilmt.a.ries. As heretofore, noteR for the com· 11ilatiou of tlie Coast Pilot were reconled itt all point8 like].)' to be resorte1l to hy trading yessels. Mr. J. R. Barkei' accom11anied the party as draughtsman aml sketcl1ed views of Hatteras Inlet, · Ocraooke Inlet; <>f the entrances to Core Sound and X euse m \'er; of the >icinity of New Berne and Washington, X.

J,ieutenant Collins wa.s assisted in this service by l\fasten~ Francis "'inslow aml H. II. Barrull, U. S. N. After the retnru of the Palinnrus to ~orfolk 011 the 1st of December, 1878, the officers proceeded to ·washington, and there completed the descriptfre 11otm1 pertaining to the work do1w in Albemarle and Pamplico Sounds. Cape Lookout Oove.-It has been noticed for some years that the small bight in!:)ide of Cape Lookout so increased a:s to promise the a.dvantages of a harbor of refuge. In orller to denlop the improved condition of the place, a careful survey of tlie cove was included in the plan of work foi· ... the party in the schooner Palinnrus, the prosecution of which was mentioned under the last head.

J,ieutenant Moser returued to Section IV, and commenced inshore sou111lings al)ff\"e Cape Fear on the 3d of 1\farch, 1879. As heretofore, the erection of Rignals along tlw beach proyef1 to be the greatest difficulty in tlie work. The coast line being inaccessible, lmnber for signal;.; was of necessity brought into place by transportation on land. Only a ff'w of the triangulation points could be found. New Inlet was de~med unsafe as a harbor for the vessel, antl the part.y was ('Onstrained to double Frying Pan Shoals in going to and from work. After setting np signals along the beach as far to nortliward as Barren Inlet, lines of soundings were run off shore to a distance of about teu milm;. At the southern limit t.he hydrograplty was joinetl with sourn1ings Jll'eYionsly made in the approaches to Cape Fear. The weather during the time employed hy the party in this section was unusuall~, severe.

Topography of Cape Fear, .J.Y. 0.-For completing the survey of Smith's Island a party was sent iu tl1e s<·hooner Caswell early in .January of the present year, to work under the direction of ARsiRtant C. T. Iardella. Jn consequence of very low tides and head winds the vessel was compelled to remain some time at a11ch01· opposih> Smit.hville, the party meanwhile going daily to work on the island, Ji rn miles distant from the anclwrage. Soon after the middle of the month, weather and tide 1mn-ing favorable, tlrn schooner was taken into the Sine, near the working ground, and the detailed snryey without further hindrance was completed at the end of ,January. During much of the time employed near the cape, the cold was extreme and high winds prevailed. The temperatnrn w:is frequently below the freezing point. As represented by the plane-taule sheet, the interior of Smit11's Isla.ml is traversed hy nnrncromi water-conrseR, ancl marked by many hammocks surrounded with marsh. During high water of spring ti aes the marsh is entirely submerged. Among the details are the coursPA'! of Cape Creek and Light-Honse Creek. Points requisite for the plane-table survey were obtained by erecting thirty-six signals, and determining the positions by observations with a theodolite.

Assistant Edwin Smith reached the last-uametl place in the middle of December, and selected a station in the grounds of Simonton College. The resulting determination for longitude was, however, referred by proper measurements to the cupola of the college building. Assistant G. W. Dean, in general charge of the work, aided by Mr. F. H.

The space sounded incll1dc8 the sea approaches to \Vinyah lfay, R O., and inshore soundings along the coast of South Carolina as far northward as Murrell's lnlt:'1t. Thiis work wa;-; closed at the end of February. The steamer Endeavor was theu mo,·ell to the Yicinity of Cape Fear, and the party engaged in work, of which mention has already becu made. lu reference to the eastern approach of Winyah Bay, Lieutenant :Moser remarks: "There appear to. be several ridges running parallel to the coast.

Tidal obserrnfi,ons.-A t Fernandina, Fla., the continuit~- of the record of tidal aud meteorological obsen-ations was iuterrnpteu h,y the illness of the obsen-er, ::\Ir. H. '"· Bache, who died at Bristol, R. J., on the 7th of Xo\ember, 1878, a.s mentioned elsewhere' in this report. So far. the endeavor to maintain the gauge iu operation with untraineu observers has heen unsuccessful, but arrangements will be made for resumiug the record at an early da;y. 1\Ir. M. O'D. \Yhite, a natiYe of the climate, is now preparing to fake charge of the apparatus. A series of obsen·ations at this station is very desirable, and in due time will be secured. · Triangulation and topOf/Y'<l/111!/ of Indian Rfrcr, Fla.-For 1·011tinuing this work Sul.Jassistaut \V. I. Vinal completed preparations iu the early part of :Nm·ember, 1878, and reached Georgiana on the 22d of that month. The 8loop Steadfast serred in pre,·ious seasons for transportation, and was relied on for continuing the survey. But the vessel had been blown from her moorings at Titusville by a hurricane on the 11th of September, and was thereby considerably injured. As soon as possible the sloo11 was refitted, and was atloat when ::\Ir. Viual arriYcd, yet much labor was requiretl for replacing on board the articles taken on shore of neccssit.r at the time of the accident. All arrangements were complete early in December, and the party rnoYed to th(' working ground, and resumed the triaugulatiou at l\Ialabar station, wllert· the operations of the preceding i<easou had been closed by Assistant. R l\I. Bache. After setting 1:1ignal1:1 to extend the triangulation soutllward, obserrntious with the theodolite were i·ro,,;ecuted as st.eadily as the ,-iuying conditions of the weather allowed. On the :.?:M of }larch the work was clooicd for the seat>ou at station!'.' about teu mile.-; below l\falahar. '' Observations ou signal,,; along the ocean beach were rendered difficult. and oft.en impossible, by almost constant Leach fog; and the work wa,,; fre11uently interrupted in. consequence of tires started by settlers in clea.ring laud, or h~· sportsmeu in driYing game. The air ornr cxtensiYc tracts was thus filled with <lensc smoke for day.-; at a time.'' A.t snch inten-als the party was employetl in cutting trails t-0· the beach through tlie thick scrnh and heaYy undergrowtli, and lines were opened to make signals inten-isible. Most of the natural difficultieis of the ground were overcome by erecting scaffold signals, with platforms elentted from eightePn to twcuty-1fre feet above the general surface. 'Vhen a sufficient number of signals ha.tl been determined, the topograpliy vrns hPguu, aml was carriell forwanl with the triangulation. The weather gn·atly improved as the s<·ason ad ,-auc{·tl. Below Malabar the ocean !Jeac!t antl the wesforn shore of Imlian Jtiyer were included in tlte 11l:rnetable snrvcy. Ensign ,fames P. Underwood, U. S.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

After returning to the office, Suhassistant Vinal turned in the topographical sheet, and engaged in computing the results of his triangulation. At the close of the :fiscal year he was assigned to field duty in Sectiou I. Suri·ey of the Gnlf coast between Charlotte Harbor and Sarasota Inlet.-For defining the Gulf coast to the northward and westward of Charlotte Harbor entrance a party was sent in Nonimber, 1878, under the charge of Subassist.ant Joseph Hergesheimer. The schooner Quick was assigned for the needful transportation from point to point. Much of the ground to be pa-"lsed over is impracticable for ordinar,Y processes in triangulation. All the station points would of necessity be eleYated structures put up at great cost, and the return in accuracy would not be commensurate with such outlay for mapping a stretch of coast, the extremities of which connect with triangulation of the usual character. Hence the part here under notice was defined principally by beach measurement. Triangles were laid out at the upper and Jower ends of the work, where the lagoons occur known as Little Sarasota Bay and Lemon Bay, antl by the points thus determine(l the. shores of the two bays were surveye.d. While the party remained in this section, the anchorage of the :schooner was in Lemon Bay, and was reached by Stump Pass, on the bar of which the de11th wais six feet. at high water. For extending the work southward from pre\';ous limits near Sarasota !'ass, Mr. Hergesheimer erected nine signals, and occupied seven points with the theodolite. Iron screw piles were set as marks at the stations, and careful measurements from each of the points to permanent objects were recorded for reference hereafter. From the la,st station on the shore of Little Samsota Bay, the beach wa{'I measurt!<l b~- couri,;ei,; in a direction soutliward ancl eastward, to an aggregate distance of ahont ten and a half miles, terminating at a station of the triangulation laid out for including Lemon Bay. ·Fourteen tripods were set up between that station and Gasparilla Pass, where the triangulation of Charlotte Harbor was dmmd in a, former season. The work in charge of Subassistant Hergesheimer was well aclyanced towart1s completion when it was found that all the parties in the field could not he retained with the balance of the appropriation for the year. In con8e11uence the operatiom; on the shores of Lemon Bay were closed on the 10th of March. Previous to that date fifteen lines had been opened through the pines to admit of the use of the theodolite in measuring horizontal angles.

An early opportunit~· will be taken for completing the connection along the beach between the separate surveys of Charlotte Harbor and Sarasota Bay. Thirty-:fi\·e miles of the coast of the p.ulf of l\Ie:x:ico are included in the operations of this 11arty. Gulf' hydrograpky nea-r Charlotte Harbor, Fla.-The plan of work laid out for the party in the steame; Bache included the extension of the inshore hydrograpby of the Gulf of Mexico, abo·e and below the entrance to Charlotte Harbor, and also in the vicinity of Tampa Eay. Lieut. Commander 0. M. Chester, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coast ancl Geodetic Survey, arrived at Charlotte Harbor with his party early in January, 1879, ancl made arrangements for prosecuting work afloat, to fill the projections sent from the office. In the course of a fortnight, however, an emergency arose, calling for the transfer of the steamer anll party to Section VIII, under which head mention will be made of the work done in the spring of the present year. The party was engaged also in Sections I aml 1I. Magneti{> observatiom.-In pre"ious reports reference was mad.fl to determinations of the magnetic elements at points so selectOO that the results would yield the utmost in regard to present knowledge of the distribution of magnetism over the area, and also seaward of the coast lines of th.e United States. For the compasses which appear on our charts, the data have been so procured, and in the course of the fiscal year additional points were occupied for the same purpose in the interior, north of the coast of Texas, as w'\n be mentioned elsewhere in this repor~nder :uropeP heads. In gen· eral the positio~ here refe~ to are on isogonic linest hat iu their extension.southward~ the Gul

of Mexico. It was, therefore, desirable to procure observations of the magnetic elements at points along the northern coaRt line of the islands which inelose the Gulf basin. This duty was intrusted to Lieut. S. 111. Ackley, U.S. X, Assistant in the Coast aml Geodetic Survey, and has been successfully accomplished as to the eastern series of stations marked for occupation. If practicable, the western stations wiU he occupied in the ensuing year. Before setting out with his party in the schooner Eagre, in .Tanua.ry last, I ..ieutenant Ackley practiced at the magnetic station of the surve:r with instruments for determining the declination, dip, and intensity, and conferred fully with Assistant Charles A. Schott in regard to the requirements for precision in obser,·ing and for keeping the field record. On the paAsage t-1onthward the Eagre touched at Fernandina, Fla., and was there swung, in order to aseertain tlw 1lcYiatim1 of tht> compasR due to tlw iron used in tl1e construction of the \esscl. Subsequently U1c Eagrc was swung for the same purpose at Bahia Honda, on the north coast of Cuba, and again at :Fernandina on the return of the party from the Gulf of Mexico. No perceptible change had taken place during the run of the vessel in the vicinity of the West India Islands. Lieutrnant Ackley was provided at the office with a good azimuth compass, a magnetometer (C. S. No. 8), and a Kew dip circle (Casella, C. S. No. 18), tbe latter provided with needles for deflect.ions, and also to be used with fine weights. The schooner Eagre being a wooden-built sailing vessel, was specially adapted for the work here under notice. After recording observations of the magnetic elements at Fernandinai Lieutenant Ackley occupied stations at Nassau {New Proridence); at South Bernini and ·water Cay; at Matanzas and Havana (Cuba); at Key West, Fla.; at Bahia Honda and Cape San Antonio (Cuba); at Belize on the coast of Honduras; at Cozumel Island, and at Mnjeres Island, oft' the east coast of Yucatan. ''When the weather and other circumstances won ld admit, obser,·ations for tlw. magnetic decli· nation were taken at, sea, with variable results. The amplitudes when the snn could he observed directly we1·e very good, lmt the azimuths not so, ou accouut of the vibrat.ion of the sun·s image on the refleetors." While at sea Lieutenant Ackle,v recorded observations fm- the declination at twenty positiom1. The interest manifested in the work by that intelligent aml energetic officer enlisted the members or the party, and all familiarized tbemio;ekes more or lesio; with the use of the instruments. At Belize, in British Honduras, Go,·ernor Barlee received the 11arty with great cord;ality, aud afforded all facilities for conducting the magnetic observations in the grounds of the gornrnment house. A true meridian line was traced there and marked, at the governor's request, for the use of tlie colonial surveyors. At all the stations occupied, twelve in number, three complete sets of observations were recorded, except at Water Cay, on the northwest side of Salt Key Bank. The vessel remained there four days, but landing was impracticable on account of a northeast gale. Lieutenant Ackley was assisted in these obser,ations by Lieut. II. T. l\fonahon, U.S. N.; Master F. E. Sawyer, U. S. N.; and Ensign ,V, If. Nostrand, U.S. N. The schooner Eagre, after closiug work in the Gulf of Mexico, returned north, and arri\ed at Washington, D. C., at the end of May. Under Section I, mention has been mru:le of work previously conducted by I..ieutk\nant Ackley.

Reconnaissance and geodetic uiork in Alabama and Mississippi.-In extending triangulation west· ward from the ba-<re line near Atlanta, Ga., special difficulties have been encountered in the selection of points. As stated in former reports, mountain ridges, that under other conditions would be favorable, are in this region hindranees to progress. Being of equal height~ near together, and running in a direction transverse to that desirable for the chain of quadrilaterals, lines of requisite length have been obtained only by unusual labor. .Assistant C. O. Boute1le remained in the field during the first half of the fiscal year, snd pushed the reconnaissance westward of stations in Alabama at which angular measurements were com·

JJleted in the preceding season. After a thorough examination it was fouud that, in general, structures will be required to eleYate the the,odolite when the stations are occupied. Points were Belectea by l\Ir. Boutelle for extending the triangt1lation across tlie bonrnlary line between Alabama aml Mississippi, and at these the greater labor of openiug lines of sight on wooded mountain ridges will be avoided by constructing high platforllls when the angular measurements are made. . \ssistant F. D. Granger was in tlle tield when my last annual report was closed, and had traversed the region of northern ::\Iississippi lying eastward of Holly Springs, finding llifficulties, such as have been mentioned, in obtaining a phtu for continuing Held work towar1ls the :Mississippi Ri\·er. Beyond the western limits rnanhml b~· ~\ssistant Boutelle, l\fr. nranger select{"l two stations, and in succession others to extend the series of points be,voml Ripley t{J stations in the ,·icinity of Holly Springs. On some of the ridges (all being heavily wooded) extreme labor was incmred in identif.ying a1\jarent point8 at which flags had been plared on high trees ; at others it was found necessary to open a\·enues to bring into view the outlying flta.tious of the s<~heme of triangulation. The line~" Yary in leugth from tm1 to thirty miles, but the surf':we of the region is such, that tripods , of fifty anll sixty feet will be requisite, arnl, at some of' the stations, strnctures of greater height for bearing the theodolite. \Vhile on reconnaissance, ~<\ssi;;;taut Granger mounted trees frolll seventy to ninety feet high, and obserYed on flags attached to long poles, and nailed to th<· top8 of trees of even greater height. The region traYersed affords few facilities for comfort in travel, but the people are hospitable, and readily aided in further~ng the purposes of the reconnaissance. The descriptions of the stations adopted include mention of the height of the tripod required at each. ):Ir. Uranger remained in the field until the 20th of January, 1879, and then returned to the office. At Wilson station Assistaut Boutelle put up a tripod, witLt a .'lcaffohl for supporting the twenty- , inch theodolite at an elevation of seventy feet above the grournl. J uue and ,July were pa<ised in measuring horizoutal angles frolll that JlOint, the excessh'e heat and consequent exlialations aml haze having mucb delayed the work. During twenty-two consecutiYe days in .July, a" shown by the field report, the tem1)erature of tbe air ranged night and day between 85° and 98°. Warnock l\Iountain was occn1lied in August, and early in September the party was transferred to Smitlier's Mountain. Herc the operations were further dela.;re11. Yellow fever, then ragi11g at Memphis, had advanced along the Tennessee River to Tuscumhia, l?lorence, anll Decatnr, or within twenty miles of the geodetic station, aml directly upon the lines of railroa1l used in posting and communicating with the heliotropers at outlying stations. By the 20th of October, however, all obsern1tions were 1·ompleted at Smither's. Tile instruments were then removed to Tanyal'd ::\fountain, three miles west of Court.land, Alabama. Assistant Boutelle proceeded to occupy that station, retaining the aill, l\Ir. C. Terry. :Mr. J.B. Boutelle was sent to observe at Summit station the angles u11on "Tilson, whid1 point was not Yisible when Summit was occupied in 18i7. At Tau,vartl Mountain a tripofl with scaffold l·fovated one lumdre1l feet from the ground was re,quisite for bringing iuto view adjacent points of the scheme of triangulation. Armngements were made for its eom;truction, but while the work was in progress Assistant Boutelle, in consPquener. of a serious hurt early in No\'emb<~r, was compelled to leave the field. The astronomical work was continued by l\Ir .·J. B. Bout,elle. After closing the angular measurements at Summit he recorded ohservatious for latitude on twenty-nine pairs of stars duri11g ten nights in December. Azimuth was determined in the latter part of N ovembei· by obseryations on Polaris with the twenty~ inch theodolite; local timll wa8 ascertained as usual, aud the customary tests were made during lhe nights for the value of tl1e micrometel' of zenith telescope, No. 5. :Nineteen directions upon as mauy 8tations were tleterminell in the course of' the season by thirty-three series of observations; forty-three subsitliary o~jects were obser\·ed on from the primary stations, for position and elevatiou, all(l ninetoou zenith distances wei·e carefully recorded for ascertaining the heights of the 1irimary stations.

In his field report Assistant Boutelle remarks as follows: "An inference of the late Assistant Webber from the discussion of his record of vertical angles, has been verified bs the obsenations of this season. 'Ve fo1d the ollserve<l coe1licient of refraction to be lesf! on the western than un the eastern slope of the Appaladiian chain, for points of equal elevation. This may be due to a srnalher amount of aqueous \·apor in the air of the western slope.1; than in that upon the ocean side of th~ great dividing range of mountains.'' Currents ttear the 1lfiRsissippi I>elta.-For observing and recording the currents of the Gulf of Mexico in the approaches to the :Mississippi Delta, a party was assigned early in .Ja.nuar,y for serdcl:' in the schooner Drift, untler the charge of Master Hobert Platt, U. 8.

In the phm of wor·k, thfrteen stations were imlieated lJy Assistant. Henry 1\:litcliell, and it was tlesirahle Uiat tlJe current:-; ,..,lwnld he ohsm·rnd while tLe schooner was at anchor. Ma.~ter Platt joi11Pll the party at. Port I~ad:-i ou the 18th of Februar~·, aml found the vessel in readiness for the int('nded work. Efforts ma<le in '.\larch to occupy stations were mtwh intermptetl l>.r fog and win<l. l':ltweral of the stations were ocenpit~tl twief>, anll one of them three times, in order to secure tlic ol.J1:11~rvations tlc:,;ired. The mouth of April was fayorable in respect of weather, hnt difticuJt.y was experienced in cousequence of the softuess of the bottom on which t.be anchor was dropped. Slight lweeiws caused the ressel to drag awa~· from tl1e station; and the currents were sncl1 as to take the vessel off her <·onrse as mnel1 as three or four miles, in a run of only twelve miles. By the pilots this peculiar moYemeut is t('rme(l the "witelt c1trrent.'' From the observations thm; fal' reco1-.led l\faistt>r Platt could uot identify, near the Delta, any regular current 01· tidal currents, to conipare in any dPgree with what has ueeu so well (lefined by the operationis of the same paL't,y in the <lulf of l\iaiue. Of tile stations O<'{~upietl, four were ueur the entrances to the four i·asses. Ontsilfo of tltese a 1'ecoml series was obse1Ted with stations ;1t several points between the appro~whes to tlrn passm;. 'l'he cnrreut..s were ol>sern·tl at t.he surfaee, and at depths of tweh·e feet, five fathoms, ten, twenty, thirty, forty-five, eighty, anti nfoety fathoms. according the depU1 of water at the stations occupied. The ouh'r series was at an average distance of about eleven miles from the entrances to tlJe 11as:;es. All the positions o<·.cu})ietl were preyiously indicat.ed by Assistant Mitchell. .l\faster Platt was assisted in this work h,v Ensigns J. W. 8tewa1·t a11d .r. C. Colwell, F. S. X. 'l'he schooner ])rift again reached New York near the mrd of ~ras. At the several current staticms the temperature of the water was l'ecortletl at the surface aml bottom, and also at each station, at a de11th intermediate between the bottom and the surface. An aggregate of four hundred aml ninety-sen·n obsernttions was recorded with thermometers. 'l'be currents at varying depths for the thirteen statiotrn were lleter1uined by twenty-one lumtlred au!I thirty-one observations. As might be expect~<l, Master Pla~t found the currents in the yicinity of the Delta extremely variable. Occasionally it was ohserrnd that while the sul'tace curreut was iu one direction, the water at a few feet below the surface was moying in a coutmry direction. Work done by the party in the schooner Drift t>arlier in the fho;cal year has been mentioned under the head of Section 1 in this report. Tidal obserration.~.-Tl1e observatio11s rec<rnl<itl regularly at intervals of six hours on a st:1tr gauge a.t New Orleans, by ~fr. G. Faust, begun January 1, 1872, were closed Oll the 1st of .Tanuar.v, 1879. Tlte daily iluctllation is of course nea,rJJ insensible, hut the rise and fall iu the eourse of the year amountiug to eleven or twelve feet, due t-0 floods and occasional dry seasons, are worthy of investigation l>ecaW!e of their seeming periodicity, and it would appear that without question such periodicity must be related to meteorological conclitions prevailing over large tracts of C'ountry in the region of the Mississippi. Triangu!,a,twn of tlie 1Jfissi.~sippi River.-The scheme of triangulation laicl out by Assistant :F. \V. Pm-kins in the summer of 1878, and of wlaich the details were resumed in the present season and. prosecuted ·until the cloae of the fiscal year, includes about twenty-four miles of the river coarse above the base line at Donaldsonville. Owing to the topographical peculiarities of the region the selection of stations was diffioult.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

The highest land and principal obstructions lying along the middle of the tract to be trianguJated, it was necessary to rnn ont eiwl1 line hefore <leciding upon the location of a point for advancing the scheme. 1fa11y of the points were not iut.erYisihle because of the growth of corn and cane, but these came into Yiew aft.er t.he n·nHffa 1 of the rl'ops. In 1Si8, Assistant Perkins remained at work on the l\Iissisl'lippi until late in Augnst. Yellow feYN' was then pren1lent above and below the site of operations, hut no case of sickness had occurred in the party. The air was unusually still, and there was rarely wind enough to admit of moving the schoont'!r Researc11, on which the party relied for transportation. As a consequence the hands were constrained to travel unusual distances while employed in erecting signal~. The :fiel<l report fo1· that summer sLows that rain fell eYery afteruoou, almost without exception, dnl'iug the stay of tlie party, arnl that the beat was extreme. As the snmnH'l' of 18i8 drt>w on, tlJi; alarm on account of yellow fon·r beeauw general. Parties from an infectetl district were not admitte1l elsewhere, and finally it became uncertain whether supplies eould lip had for con tinning work, or communications be maintainetl hy mail with the office in Washiugton. The bands were willing to remain, but nuder the <'ircumstances it ,\,as deemerl inexpedient to prosecute further operationfl. Assistant Perkins wn,14. therefore directecl to close for the season and 11is)iand llis party. At the en<l of Aug·ust, 18iS, he retnrn(;d to the office. Capt. Henry T. Hutchinson, sailing master of tile schooner Research, Jll'eferred to remain at Donaldsonville in charge of the veRRel. He had passed several summers at and near New Orleans when fever preniiled, an<l had no fear in regard to the disea..:;e. A few weeks after the close of work on the rin'r, when infection became general in the town, it wa.s deemed achTisable to moor the schooner at a conYeuient place about a mile and a half UJ? stream, and for that purpose the sailing master wa:; antlwrized to ship it st>amau to assist in the transfer and fnture care of tile vessel. The Research TVas ta.ken to her anchorage, ahove Donald.~om'ille, on the 18th of September, 1878, and fise weekl'I passed without incidt-nt. But, notwithstanding all 1irecautions, and in a position which Captain Ilutchinson regarded as exempt from infection, hp, was seized with yellow fever, and died on hoarcl the yessel on the 30th of October, after au illness of only five days. In Deceruher the Rcbooner was d.isinteeted and refitted for service hy the part.y. ·Fielcl work was then resumetl hy .Assistant Perkins, all the points of triangulation were finally selected, 8ignals were erect~d, and lines of sight were opened. Up the riYer a careful reconnaissance was ma.de for continuing tlie work as far aA the hend below Uaton Houge. Throughout this stretch of' the river close examination ha.s hee11 fo11111l necessary, in a.11vance of locating the signals, bJ preserve the seale of the t.riangnlatinn. The work was a<lvancing favorably in the middle of May, when Mr. Perkins re.ported that it 1~oulrl well be continued through the summer unless there Rhould be a recurrence of yellow tevPr.

N., Assistant in the Ooa.'!t and Geodetic Survey, :reached New Orleans on the 21st of January, 1871-1, provided wit.11 a Pl'<1iection for soundings between Grand View Reacli and Point Houmas. Work was commenced without delay, and while the hydrography was in progress the tides were observed a.nd recorded at Homestead Plantation and at New Hope Landing. Soundings were made also at t.he mouths oft.he Atcl1afalaya a.ml Red River, and at several of the crevasses. Commander E. P. Lull, U.S. N., hydrographic inspector of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, accompanied the iiarty while engaged on the Mississippi, and oollooted important particulars in regard to changes which have affected that great highway to the Gulf within recent yea.rs. These include the history of thf' Atchafalaya as an outlet of the Mississippi during a pe.riod of fifty yea.rs, and remarks on the relation of 'both to Red River.

Sixty-nine miles of the course of the riYer are defined h,,. the operations of this party during the season. In order to avoid heavy cutting, and the claims for damages incident thereto, the triangulation stations were in general located on the immediate lmnks of the rirnr. But the disadvantage of the reduced scale for triangle sides was m·ereome, as far as possible, h;r the care of Mr. Dennis in arranging the scheme of work so as to ohtain doulile, aml often triple, detcnuiuatious of the station points. Not.with8tauding the lessened size of the tria,uglcs, au aggrt>gate of twentyfi>e miles of cutting was uece8sar.r, mostl;y through the light growUJ of willows, anll for this no outlay was incurred in damages.

Triangulation of the Mississippi Rirer from Bennetts Landing to Jfemphis, Tenn.-For continuing the triangulation of the Mississippi, the 11arty of .Assistant C. H. Ho;nl was orgimized on the 20th of December, 1878, on board tl1e 8teamer Bato.n Uouge, at Helena, Ark. As the yellow fever had not then entirely ce~sed in that locality, the repair8 to the boiler of the vessel were hastened, and all arrangements were complete by the end of the month, but se\·erc weather closed navigation for several weeks in JanuarJ. \Vhen the ice gave way the party proceeded to Bennett's Landing, and resumed work at the limits of previous operatfon:-;. .For a fortnight progress was interrupted, and the nssel enda.ugered by drift ice, but inconYeni1mcc from that. cause proved to be temporary. Field work was continuetl up the river without iotnruption until the middle of March, when the engiueer, Mr. '\Y. H. Pleasants, was suddenly taken with the country fenr, and died after being ill only three days. He was a faithful antl energetic memlwr of the J>arty on the llaton Rouge, and was in high esteem among his associates. The condition of the grournl in the latter part of }farclt being farnrable for the measurement of a cheek base at the end of the triangulation, J\lr. Ro:yd prepared aml measured a line of twentyfi ve hundred and fifty meters at Hopefield, directly opposite the cityof'J\lemphis. The emls of the line are in proper geodetic connection with the astronomical station occupied in that city in the year 187i'. Substantial monuments were set, as usual, to mark the lfo11etield base liue. Azimuth was determimitl at the southern end of the bitse, aml equal altitude obsenTations were recorded during a fortnight for rating chronometers. A ft:er completing the azimuth obsen-ations, the triaugulation was resumed, and extended down thf', rh·er to a junction witlt the work done at the outset of the season. In general the stations occnpied were in the immediate vicinit,r of the shore lines of the iiver. About thirty-one miles of the couri;e of the Mississippi is included in the work of Assistant Bo;yd during this season. Bady in May the lmutlis iu the imrty became affecte.d by the sickness incident to the region. and the further prosecution of field work was deemed inexpedient. Afte.r the discharge of the crew the steamer was laid up at Helena. Master '\Villiam Kilburn, U. S . .X., was attached to this party, and rcu<lcretl acceptable se1Tice in th<> management of the Yessel, aud care of the crew while field operations were in progress. 'file character of the country cornretl by this work, is similar to that passed over last season1leno;e swamp forests, extensive sand shoals, and caving river banks.

Several da~-s were employed in reconnai8sance and in erecting arnl determining the positions 8ignals, but as Yery few of tire station marks of the triangulation conJtl be found, determinations were made by reference to Matagorda light, Balf 1\loon Heef light, aml the remains of houses, the chimneys of which, as points ollserved from other points of triangulation, were marked on the projectiou taken b~y Lieutenant-Commander Gedney. Sounding:,; were begun on the 20th of March and closed on the 19th of .Tune. Beginniug at a point near the upper end of Matagorea peninsula, the bydrogeaphy of the coast of Texas wa15 made continuous from itis previous limit, and pushed i;outhward and westward about fifty-five miles to a position tweh·e mil(·s south of Pass ()a,·allo. A.t inten·als of about a mile, lines \Vere run normal to the coast, and into the Gulf to au average distance of eleven miles, and thei;c were crossed for wrification hy two line;;, one in three fathoms, aud tlie other in se\·eu fatl1oms of water. );o shoals were found, the depth iticreasinp: en~nl.Y in g-oing outward to tweh-e or thirteen fathoms at tweh'e miles from the shore.

Hydrog>·apky C!,f We.Ht Indicui approarltes to tke Gnlf of Mc.vico.-ln order to complete the hydrographic development of the southern approaches to tbe Gu1f of l\Iexico, the steamer Blake was refitted under the direction and supervision of Lieutenant-Commander 8igsbee, and passed south· ward early in December, 1878, with a party in charge of Uommandcr J. R. Bartlett, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Snrrny. Provision was made, as in the cruise of last year, for procuring specimens of life to be found in the watern traversed by the hydrographic party, and, as before, Prof. Alexander Agassiz, with his assistant, S. 1V. Garman, accompanied the vessel. The steamer Blake reached Key \Vest on the 6th of December after a st-0rmy passage. Coal was taken in, and the vessel prooeeded to Port Royal (.Tamaiea), making, off Havana, several succeRsful hauls with the dredge, and others in t.llf· hight t<i the eastward of the f',ntrance to the harbor of Port l{oyal. _A line of 1muu1lings was nm a1'.ro1;,.; the ohl Haliam;1 clrnnnpl abreast of I1obos Uay light, showing in tlH' de(·pcst part 0111~· 1i·rn lm1111re1l fathoms, l~lthongh the onliuary charts are marked "niue lumdred fathoms, uo bottom.''

On hiK course :-mnthward Commander Ba.rtlett note1l a. number of enors iu the charts hitherto relit>d uu b.v uayigat{m;. On the course from Kingston t.o St. '.l'homa.s work was impractkahle in cousrntuence of the heavy sea; the tmdes were almost a gale, aml the steamer conld make only a\Jout. two knots per ltonr against wind and sen between Jamaica and Hayti. :Prom .Jamaica to St. Thotnal:l a current was fonnd settiug to the eastward, at times with a rate of two knots per bour, making a very short, di.,agreeable sea. In reference to this murent Coinrmtnder Bartlett ob1Serves: "The captain of the English telegi:aph i,;teamer at St. 'l'homa~ !',a.,vs that at Uii:-; time of the year he generally found the current Sl~tting to the eai;tward, south of St. Domingo and Porto Rioo; and mention of it is a.lso made in the Sailing Direction;; issued liy the Hydrographic Office, in which it is said to be south of .Jamaica. In my opinion the Daribbe:m Sea has a circulation of its m\·n, independent of any source of supply or waterway for the Gulf Stream." After leaving the aucborage under Ile de Vache, strong trade winds were met. in going ea.st. ward until south of l'orto Hico, and there soundings and dredgings were made in eight hundred and seveuty-four fathoms of water. At St. Thomas the Danish governor Yisited tlte steamer Hlake, and manifested special interest iu the appar!ttm,; and inoposed inYestigations. The gover1101· ha<l examined the outfit of the ChaL lenger when that wssel was at St. Thomas, anJ recognized that im11r0Yements had been made. in the sounding apparatus used on board the Blake. }:ar1~- in .lanuar~· a week was pa.:ssed iu somHling an<l dredging between the island of St. Thom:h< a.nd S:mta Cm~. Twenty-seven hauls were ma<le, antl a, variety of living specimens obtained, some from a depth of twenty-three hurtdred att<l seventy· six fathoms, the trawl bringing up at the same time from that depth a roek weighing three hundred pouucls. , Ry the middle of .;Tauuary the opera,tiorns of the party muler Commander Bartlett had procured specimeus sufficient to enable rrofessm Agal'isiz to de:scrihe the characforistic fauna of the sea in the vicinity of Onba1 Hayti, .Jamaiea, l'orto Rieo, aml the Virgin group of islan1ls. The latter part of the month OCCU})ie1l in dredging along the islands from St. Cbristopber to Dominica, and in that neighborhood one hundred hauls were successfully made. In the passages from island to island tlic trade winds continued. to be ·ery Rtrong. Ilredging was carried on uncler the lee of each iisland and along the Grenadines to Grenada; also across the channel to 'tlte southwar<l of the lastw1 med island. Barlmdoes was rcaehe<l on the 4th of March, 187H, aml a week was spent in dredging uucler its lee. Herc man;r of tile crew were affected b~- malarial fever, though all bands remained well until a few days previous to the aIThral of tlw Blake. The fo\'er a1>peared soon after toucliing at G renatla, but fortunately no case took a serious turn. At Barbatloes, l'rofessor Agassiz left the vessel and returnell to i·esumc professional dut-ies at Cambridge. All the dredging apparatus was then unrigged in pre1>aration for recording soundings ilming the remainder of the season. From Barbadoes and St. Vincent lines were run in passing from one to another of the Windward Ii;lands, and the soundings show that in the passages between the islands the depth in each case is less than the depth of wat~r inside or outside of the range. The channels thus developed seem to be merely depressions in a range of partly submerged

In general reference to the subject, Cornmanrler Bartlett remarks: "The water does not set into the Caribbean Sea through the channels between the islands to any great extent.. Thi.\ tra1le wi11d bankf< the water against the windward side of the islands, and near their ends the current setR Htrong t.o t11t> westward; but near midclmnnel between the islanrls l haYe D!Wt':t' fonrnl a west.cl'ly current.

"Tbe Blake made the passage from St. Yinceut to Barbadoes with a Yery light easterly breeze, and was set ftfteen miles northwest. Returning to St. Lucia, l found a. northerly set of niueteen miles in twelve hours, aml when steering north from Barbadoes a current was found of a knot arnl a half setting north. H. B. M. ship Blanche reported at Barbadocs that on the course from l\fartiuiqtte she had a northerly cuITent of forty miles in twenty-four hottrs. "North of Guadaloupe the current was very strong to tbe northward. It was quite :,;month after leaving Saba Islaml, and I found the culTent north-northwest, about a mile per hour. ~.\ current of one knot was also observed setting to the eastward on the course from Xevis Island to Santa Cruz." The Blake sailctl from St. Thomai;; on the 27th of April for the Mona Passage. There the current showed an ebb and fl.ow, but after clearing the Passage, and to the northward of St. j)omingo, a current was entered setting to the westward over one knot per hour. The depth of water found between St. Domingo and the Bahama Banks was two thousand fathoms. While the steamer was at work in the vicinity of the 'Vindward Islands large patches of seaweed were observed, during light winds and calms always t.ending in long lines to the northward.

also from the last-namea bank to Cape St. Antonio, gi\'ing depths of oYer two thousand fathoms in the Gulf of Hondura~. Commander Bartlett, in his report accompanying the record of the season's work, deduces from his obsen·ations on the currents, tliat the equatorial cuneut which sets directly against the Windward Islands is hy them and their connect.ing ri<lges <lefiected northward, and so follows their outer edge, and passes around the Yirgin Islands to the westward through the deep channel north of St. Domingo. Ile suggests also that on reaching Ouba the current divides, part flowing north throngl1 t1ie old Baliama Chanue1, a.ml part through tile 'Vindward Passage by the deep channel llt'tween Cuba arnl .Jamaica, an<l thus h~- (Jape Ht. Antonio into the Gulf of Mexico. His report states tl1at the sped mens of bottom taken in the \Yind war1l Passage gh·e eYidcnce that tlJe eurrent in that passage morns in depths greater than eight hundred fathorm;, and that it reaches the bottom. The temperature found on the ridge at eight hundred fathoms was 39°, and tlJis temperature was always found ~it, and below that depth imiide, as is also the case in tlH· Gulf of Mexico. Outside of the ridge the temperature fell w 3(i~o, at two thousand fathoms. Between Rosalind Bank and ll11ba the current.<; were observed to he Yery feeble, and there was a total absenee of Gulf weell in tliose waters. On the current found south of Greua,da, and especial1y in referenee to its origin, Colllman<ler Bartlett remarks as follows: "The current always found flowing north a1ong the eastern side of South America, on reaching the island of Tobago diYides, part joining the equatorial current setting north along the chain of islands; the remainder following the coast line of Trinidad and the Spanish Main, and so around the entire circumferen-0e of the Caribbean Sea, finding at last an outlet at the Mona Passage and the Anegada Channel to join the equatorial current on its way t-0 the Gulf of l\Iexi,po." Aft~r closing opei:ations for the seasou at the south, tht>. 11teamer J)]ake reached New York at tht> end of May. In the work here noticed, Commander Bartlett was assiste£1 by Lieuts. \\". 0. Sharrer and .T. P. Wallis, U. S. N.; Master H. M. Jacoby, U. S. N., and Ensigns G. N. Peters aud :KI~. Reyno1<ls, U. S. N. The records of the various operations in seryiee afloat were made b,Y Assistant Surgeon Charles ,J. Nourse, U. S. N., and Mr. L. C. Sigsbee. Commander Bartlett's suggestion in regard to the course of the currents in the Caribbean Sea is based on observations made during part of a single season. Similar obsenations repeated in other years would be requisite to substantiate the theory. Professor Agassiz, in a very interesting communication (Appendix No. 6), remarks as follows: "One of the most interesting results reached by this year's cruise is the light thrown upon the former extension of the South American continent by the soundings taken while dredging, and those subsequently made in the passages betweeu the islands by Commander Bartlett. These, t-0gether with the souudings alrea1ly known, enable us to tmce the outline of the old ·continent with tolerable accuracy, and thus obtain some intelligible, and at the same time trustworthy, explanation of the peculiar geographical distribution of the fauna and flora of the \Vest India Islan<ls. As is well known, Cuba, the Bahamas, Hayti, and Porto Rico, irnstead of showing, as we might naturally &'iBume from their present proximity to .Florida, a decided affinity iu their fauna and flora with that of the Southern United States, show, on the contrary, unmistakable association with that of MexiC{>, Hon<luras, and Central America. The Caribbean Islands show in part the same relationship, though the affinity to the Y eneznelan and Brazilian tanna aud flora is mu-0h more marked." 41 Jn attempting to rooonstruct, from tlJe soundings, the state of things existing in a former period, we are at once struck by the fact that the Vil'gin Islands are the outcropping of' an extensive bank. The greatest depth between these islands is less than forty fathoms, this same depth being found on tbe bank to the east. of l~orto Hico, the one-hundred-fathom line forming, in fact, the outline of a large island, which would include tlw whole of the Virgin.Islands, the whole of Porto Rico, and extend some way into the ~Iona Passage. The one-hundred-fathom line similarly forms a large plateau, uniting Anguilla, St. Martin, and St. Bartholomew. It also unites Barbuda and Antigua, forms the Saba Bank, unites St. Eustatins, St. Christopher, Ne\is, and Redonda. It forms an elongated plateau, extending from Bequia to the southwest of Grenada, and mns more or less parallel to the Sooth American coast from the Margarita. Islands, leaving a comparatively narrow channel betw~n it and the one-hundred-fathom line MOnth of Grenada, so as t-0 iuclose

Trinidad and Tobago within its limits, and rnns off to the southeast in a direction also about parallel to the shore line. At the western end of the Caribbean Sea the one-hundred-fathom line forms a gigantic bank off the Mosquito coast, extending over one-third the distance from the mainland to the island of Jamaica. The Hosalind and Pedro Banks, forRled by the same line and a fow other smaller banks, denote the position of more or less important islands which must have onoo existed between the Mosquito coast and Jamaica. On examining the frrn-hundred-fathorn line, we thus find that Jamaica is only the northern spit of a gigantic promontory, which once extended toward Hayti from the mainland, reaching from Costa Rica to the northern part of the Mosquito coast, and leaving but a comparatively narrow passage between it and the fi\'e-hundrcd-fatbom line encircling Hayti, Porto Rico, and the Virgin Islands in one gigantic island. The Jlassage between Uuba and Jamaica has a depth of three thousand fathoms, aml·that between Ilayti and Cuba is not less than eight hundred and sernnty-three fathoms, the latter being probably an arm of the Atlantic. The five-hundred-fathom line connects as a gigantic island, the banki;;; uniting Anguilla t-0 St. Bartholomew, 8aba Bank, the one connecting St. Eustatius to Nevis, l3arbuda to Antigua, arnl from thence extends south so as to include Guadeloupe, Marie-Galante, and Dominica. This five-hurnlred-fathom line thus forms one gigantic island of the northern islands, extending from Saba Bank to Santa Cruz, and leaving but a narrow channel between it and the eastern end of the fh·e-lmndred-fathom line running round Santa Crnz. As Santa Cruz is separated from St. Thoma.s by a channel of forty miles, with a maximum depth of over twenty-four hundred fathoms, this plainly shows its connection with the northern islands of the Caribbean group, rather than with St. Thomas, as is also well shown by the geographical relations of its Mollusca. The five-hundred-fathom line again unites, in oue gigantic spit extending northerly from the mouth of the Orinoco, all t.he islands to the south of Martinique, leaving Barba.does to the east, and a narrow passage betwe(iln Martinique and the islands of Dominica and St. Lucia. "At the time of this connection, therefore, the Caribbean Sea connected with the Atlantic only by a narrow passage of a few miles in width between St. Lucia aud 1\I arti11ique, and one somewhat wider and slightly deeper between Martinique and Dominica., anot.lier between Sombrero and the Virgin Islands, and a comparatively narrow llassage between .Jamaica a]J(l Hayti. The Caribbean Sea, therefore, must have been a gulf of the Pacific, or have connected with it tl1rough wide passages, of wl1ich we :find the traces in the Tertiary and Cretace.ous deposits of the Ist.hmns of Darien, of Panama., and of Nicaragua. Central America and Xorthern Soutl1 A.merfoa at that time must Lave been a series of large islands with passages between them from the Pacific into the Caribbean. It is further interesting to speculate what must have become of the great equatorial c:mnent, or rather of the current produced by the northeast trades. The water banking up against the two large islands, then forming the Caribbean Isla.nlls, mnst, of course, have been <letiected north, have swept round the northern shores of the Yirgin Islands, Porto Rico, and Ha;rti, an(l poured into the western basin of the Caribbean Sea, throngb the passage between HaJti and Cuba. This wattir being forced into a sort of funnel, by the ftve-hundred-fathom line forming the southern line of the Great Bahama Island, which connected nearly the whole of the Bahamas with Cuba and formed a barrier to the western flow of the equatorial current, must, therefore, for the greater part, have been deflected north, and either swept in a northeasterly direction, as the Gulf Stream now does, or round the north end of the Bahamas, acros.s Florida, wllich did not t.heu exist, across the Gulf of Mexico, and into the Pacific over the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

" The soundings made by Commander Bartlett, after I left the Blake, to determine the ridges uniting the various islands between Sombrero and Trinidad, show plainly that the cold miter of the Caribbean can only come in through the passage between Sombrero and the Yirgin Islands, which is about eleven hundred fathoms, with a bottom temperature of 3so, while the tive.huudredfathom line, as I have said, forms a gigantic island of all the islands to t1ie south of Sombrero, including Dominica, with a narrow passage of one thousand fathoms between it aud Martinique; the five-hundred-fathom line again uniting into one large spit, as a part of South America, all the islands to the south of it. Thus the bulk of thP; water forced into the Caribbean Sea has a compat"atively high tempera.ture--;-an average, probably, of the tem1)erature of the three.hundredfathom line.

It is, therefore, incredible that with this huge mass of water pouring into the Gulf of l\lexico, there 8hould be an~·thing like a cold current forcing its way up hill into the Straits of Florida, as has been asserted on theoretical gwnnds. The channel at Gun Ke;v can onl,v discharge the surplus by having a great velocity." ]}fagnetic Observations.-"'\Vhen .my last annual report closed Subassistant J.B. Baylor was in tl1is section, determining the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity at points in Texas. He had completed observations at Dollar Point, Austin, Hempstead, and Groesbeck; and at the opening of the fiscal year, to which this report corresponds, a station was occupied at San Antonio. Passing on northward ::\'Ir. Ba,vlor determined the magnetic elements at Fort Worth, and at Sherman in Texas, and subsequently at Atoka and Eufaula in Indian Terrttory. ThiPty-four stations in all were occu1>ied in the course of the season. Of theser not already referred t-0, mention will be made further on in this report. Late in July, 1878, l\lr. Baylor proceedecl to Humboldt, Kaus., of which station, and others occupied in that region, notice will be taken under the head of ·section XV. Subsequently he recorded observations in Colorado (Section XVI); in Wyoming Territ-0ry (Section XVll l; and before closing for the ;year, also in Wisconsin and Illinois, as will be stated under the head of Section XIY. Notwithstanding the disadvantage arising from its variations from the meridian, the compass needle is almost exclusively used to mark out the boundaries of a(\joining properties. In his intercourse with the people, Subassistant Baylor fonud that every one of average intelligence recognized the practical importance of a work establishing means for the corrections of an instrument so universally used as the gurve;yor's compass. Of many of this section, who tendered courtesies and aid in his operations, Mr. Baylor's report speciall.r mentions the Hon. Guy 1\1. Bryan, of Galveston; Capt. C. Uornly, U.S. A., stationed at the San Antonio Arsenal; and l\Ir. l{hodes Fisher, chief clerk of the land office at Austin.

Geodetic operations, Santa Bm·bam Channel, Cal.-As mentioned in my last annual report, Subassistant D. B. Wainwright was in the field at the opening of the fiscal year, July 1, 1878, and was then occupying the primary station on San Clemente Island, and observing on signals previously stationed on Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands. During the stay of the party on Clemente, dense fog· generally hung around tlrnt island, but occasionally the heliotrope on Santa Barbara was seen for short periods. By watching closely, the measurement of horizontal angles was completed on the 21st of August. Before leaving the island, :Mr. Wainwright recorded observations on Polaris for azimuth. · Early in September, observations with the theodolite were begun at the primary station on Catalina Island, signals having been previously set at San Pedro Hill, and Las Bolsas on the mainland abreast of Santa Catalina. The weather proving moderately good, observations for horizontal angles and for azimuth were finished by the 5th of October. · San Pedro IIill was next occupied, and the measurement of horizontal angles needful there wa.s completed. before the middle of November. The party was then transferred to Las Bolsas, but the work at that station was much hiudered by thick smoke from burning stubble drifting from the interior down to the coast. The required measurements were, however, obtained by the 9th of December. The statistics of the work are:

Topography of Catalina an<l San Clemente blands, Cal.-The topographical survey of Catalina Island, in progTess at the opening of the fiscal year, was completed on the 2flth of .August, 1878. On the day following, Assistant Stehman Forney went to Sau Clemente iu a small sloop, and, after reconnaissance, found that his party oould be supplied with fuel and water only by trans· porting what might be requisite from the mainland or from Catalina Island. L.\_n old tank at the landing on the northwest end of San Clemente was repaired, and used for storing water while the survey of the island was in progress . .After securing the property used on Catalina, and Relecting essentials for use on San Clemente, Mr. Forney again rea.ched that island on the 14th of September with his party and supplies of water and provisions. The month following was occupied in establishiug hydrographic signals and identifying the triangulation })Oints. All the station marks were recognized, and also the astronomical station which had been occupied by Assistant Davidson in 1852. The detailed topographical survey of San Clemente Islaucl was bf1gun on the 22d of October, and was completed on the 22d of January, 187H. This island is high and hold at the southern end, the land gradually falling to the northward. Its lengtl1 is nearl.)- twenty-one and a half miles ancl the average width about two and a half miles. The southern part at one point rises to nineteen hundred and sixty-four feet above ha,Jftide, and from that, height the land gradually slopes to the northwestern end of the island. The southwestern face is marked Ly a succession of well-defined terraees, or old sea-beaches, all of wJ1ich were carefully delineated on the plane-tallle sheet by Assistant Forney. Rio; concluding report mentions Wilson's Cove as a useful anchorage. This ii; an open roadstead on the ea!'.tern Ride of the island, and rather more than two miles from its n.Jrthern extremitv. All the wool raised fn the island is sl1ipped from Wilson's Oove. Thirteen and a half miles sout:hward. and also on the eastern shore of the island, is a small co,'e called Mosquito Harbor, and that i~ reported as a gootl shelter for boats of ten tons during snmmer months. Smuggler's Cove, at the southern end of the island, affords a good lee from northwest and northeast winds, but its shallow saml beach makes the landing uncomfortable . .Along the northeastern face of San Clemente, boats may laud anywhere, but on the opposite or southwestern side there are only three practicable boat-landings; one of these, called Seal Harbor, is about midway between the northern and southern ends. This is a noted sealing-station. The other landing~ are near the north end of the island. During the stay of the party, the sea approach to the western shore was very rough, most of the time being marked by immense breakers rolling in upon the beach. "The entire surface of the island is broken up with deep gulches, especially on the southern and southwestern slopes, where some of them are eight and ten hundred feet deep. But in general the surface shows extensive plains of rolling land, thickly covered with wild grasses, oommon along the coast of California." "The geological formation is almost entirely of black volcanic rock, impervious to water, and covered with a shallow soil. In the deep gulches and other obscure parts of the island, clumps of scrub-oak aml lmshes are found, but not elsewhere. The entire southern and southwestern slope is covered with cactus, in many places so thick that it is impossible to ride a horse through it." On the plane-table sheet Mr. Forney denoted the positions of ten tanks for maintaining a supply of water for the stock raised on the island. From eight to nine thousand head of sheep arc supported annually. During summer and autumn the animals feed at nigl1t, while dew and moisture from fog are on the vegetation, and thus derive enough water to sustain themselves. On the 22d of JanuM'y Commander Coffin, by previous arrangement, transferred .Assistant Forney and his party from San Clemente Island to San Diego, where preparation was made for the survey of San Nicolas, and the party was taken t-0 that island in the Hassler on the 8th of February. Field work was begun immediately, and was prosecuted until the 15th of .March, when the means available for this work were exhausted. Mr. Forney, in consequence, disbanded the party and returned to Santa Barbara to engage in office work. His plane-table sheets of San Clemente

HydrograpTty near Santa Catalina and San Clemente Islands, Cal.-The party of Commander G. W. Coffin, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, working with the steamer Hassler, was engaged during the summer and part of the autumn of 1878 in sounding the approaches t-0 Santa Catalina Island. The results were returned to the office on three hydrographic sheets, showing the depth of water to an average distance of .five miles from the shore line, and all the reefs found within the limits of the work. After completing the survey about Santa Catalina, the Hassler sailed for San Clemente Island, taking a projection for the hydrography of its western and southern approaches. Points on the island had been determined in position by Assistant Forney, as also at Catalina, when soundings were in progress there. At San Clemente all favorable intervals were employed, and by the 17th of February the projected sheet was filled. As usual, all reefs in the vicinity of the shore line were carefully developed and marked on the chart. The statistiics of work are:

At the end of the .fiscal year the party in the steamer Hassler resumed duty afloat off the coast north of San Francisco entrance. Hydrography of Bahia de los Tremblores and adjacent coast of California.-In the prosecution of inshore hydrography of the coast of California north and west of :Sewport Bay, good progress has been made by Lieut. E. H. C. Leutze, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, with a party in the steamer McArthur. Between the 1st of July and the 16th of December, 1878, three sheets were filled with soundings. Of these, one represents the inshore hydrography from Newport Bay northward and westward to Point Fermin, developing the bight known as Bahia de los Tremblores. In connection with it the second sheet defines the character of the sea-approaches above and below San Pedro, or between Point Fermin and Point Vincente, and in the last-named vicinity joined with hydrography preYionsly completed. · Farther up the coast Lieutenant Leutze filled a third projection with soundings required to complete the Rnrvey of the ~outheastern approach to Santa Barbara Channel. The southern limit of this sheet is Point Dume, and seaward the lines of soundings were extended aoout twenty miles. A.bove Anacapa Island the work joins with hydrography done in the year 1869.

Lieutenant Lentze was assisted in the operations of the season by Lieut. E. K. Moore, U. S. N., and by Masters L. C. Hellner, W. P. Elliott, and R. H. Galt, U. S. N. At the close of the fiscal year the party in the steamer McArthur was again organ~ to prosecute soundings in the vicinity of San Clemente Island. Further mention of the work done in th&t quarter will be made in my next annual report. Triangulation and rop<>graphy of the coast between Point Arguello and Point Sal.-The party of Assistant W. E.

resumed the triangulation at points to which the work had been brought from the southward in a previous season. In going northward, stations were selected along the coast line, and others at distances inland suitable for defining the shore line north and south of Point Purissima. In the vicinity of Point Sal, l\lr. Greenwell connected his work with the primary: station I~ospe, and with points formerly determined in position. After occupying the stations of his scheme with the theodolite, and completing the angular measurements, a plane table sheet was filled with details representing the coast features north and south of Point Purissima, the work in general being carrieJ about three miles back from the water line. "The character of the topography is peculiar. Sand dunes with a trend to the eastward denote the prevailing winds of eight months of the year. Within a mile of the shore the dunes are nearly destitute of vegetation, but further inland they are covered with low bushes." Twenty-two miles of coast line are defined by the triangulation.

At the close of the fiscal year I1is party was reorganized for extending the topographical survey north and sont.h of the limits of the sheet already completed. Hydrography of Sitisun Bay and San Pablo Bay, Cal.-For this work the schooner Yukon was placed in charge of Assistant Gershom Bradford, on the 27th of July, 1878. Arrangements were made immediately by setting up a self-registering tide· gauge at Magazine wharf, on Mare Island, and in the latter part of August the hydrography was in progress in t.he vicinity of Army Point in Suisun Bay. 'l'he wind very frequently interrnptell soundings, but at such times the party was employed in erecting signals and determining the positions needful in the work. By taking all favorable intervals, the hydrography was extended to the lower end of {)hipp's Island, and through the Suisun Cut-off, and between Roe Island and King's Island. Tides were recorded steadily at a station on the eastern end of King's Island, and also at Collinsville and Benicia Arsenal. The upper part of the bay, including the mouths of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers was sounded, and all the work needful in Suisun Bay was completed by the 18th of December. Smoke from the farm refuse, which is ordinarily burnt at the approach of the rainy season, much dela_yed the operations of the party, the smoke being more dense when the wind was light, and on that account favorable for work afloat. . In the latter part of December, station marks were identified on the t<hores of San Pablo Bay. The signals needful were set up, and a tide-gauge was established at a position about three-quarters of a mile east of Penole Point. The space sounded was on the south side of the bay, abreast of Point Wilson, and extending about four miles northward. This work was completed by the 14th of March, 18791 when tl1e party was <lisbanded. Permanent bench-marks were establishe1l near the positions occupied by the tide-gauges at Magazine wharf (Mare Island) and Arsenal wharf, Benicia. The soundings were numerous, and the determinations of position made with great care. In reference to results Mr. Bradford observes: "I found considerable change in parts of the shore line in Suisun Rtty and near Collinsville, apparently the effect of the growth of tules, and the wasting and building of the banks by the action of the current. Lump.s of tule turf were noticed floating, either torn away by the water or eut a.way by dike-builders, and these lumps if deposited in an eddy would tend to form new banks. "The greatest changes have occurred at the mouth of the Sacramento, near Collinsville; at

the mouth of the San ,Joaquin, near Bush Point, and opposire to that point, at the mouth of Monrezuma Creek. The changes are also considerable at the western end of Suisun Out-off." In the prosecution of the hydrograpl1y, Assistant Bradford erected seventy-five signals, .and from shore stations meas11red seventeen hundred angles with the theodolite. Thirty-seven natural objects were determined in position.

The more important changes found by comparison with the previous sun·ey are thus noticed in the concluding report: 1. "The closing to deep vessels of the passage south of the Seal Islands by the extension of the shoal eastwartl from the eastern part of those islands. 2. "The cleepcning of water on the bar northwest of the Seal Islands from fourteen and a half feet to fifteen and seven-tenths feet. 3. "The narrowing and shoaling of the channel passing close t-0 the eastern end of Roe Island where sixteen and seven-tenths feet can now be carried only by careful steering, as against three ancl three-fourths fathoms, the last-mentioned depth being formerly found in a channel of considerable wiclth. 4. "Increase of depth eastward of Beacon 4 t-0 some se>enteen to nineteen feet, giving a clear passage thence to Middle Point. . 5. "The deepening of the bar southeastward of the Middle Ground, from fourteen feet to fifteen and a half feet." On the completion of the charts of Suisun and San Pablo Bays, Mr. Bradford resumed tho compilation of matter for the Coast Pilot of the Pacific, as heretofore under the direction of Assistant Davidson. Tidal observatfons.-The selforegistering tide- gauge established at Saucelito by Assistant George Davfrlson has been kept in successful operation during the year by Mr. E. Gray. The series has already been continued through two. years, and promises to be one of the most complete in respect of continuity. At Mare Island navy-yard a good series of observations extending through seven months, and closing in March, 1879, was recorded by Assistant Gershom Bradford. The record was kept while his party was engaged in soµnding parts of San Pablo and Suisun Bays. Geodet-ic operations in California.-At the outset of the fiscal year, as intimated in my last report, Assistant George Davidson was at Paris as a commissioner for examining and reporting upon geodetic and other instruments of precision, deposited for exhibit in the International Exposition of the year 1878. Tbc specified duties were such that attention to other branches of the exhibit would severely tax bis endurance, yet being urged to accept appointment as one of twenty-two jurors on machines, Mr. Davidson was with g1·eat unanimity at once chosen by his fellow-members as president of that jury, and throughout assisted in its deliberations. In the latter part of July, 1878, the presentation of his detailed report on machines left him free t-0 pursue the special object of the sojourn abroad, and hy arduous application through the month of .August, Mr. Davidson was enabled to complete examinations of theodolites, transits, levels, and such telegraph apparatus a8 might be useful in longitude determinations. Subsequently some of the most noted workshops in Paris were visited, and in the course of the autumn the principal manufactories of Geneva, N eucbatel, Munich, Vienna, Dresden, Berlin, Hamburg, Cassel, London,_ and York. Professor Davidson gave special attention to such graduating engines as were not carefully excluded from view, but in Paris he was prohibited from even testing the graduation of theodolites, or from making any sketches or drawings. One of the principal cases of instruments at the Exposition was kept permanently closed, so as to proolude inspecti.on of the details of construction. As Professor Davidson had with great patience made tests of graduations in America, it was judged to be part of his duty to inquire of manufacturers of repute in Europe, but no one of the number questioned had ever tested a theodolite after graduation. The coneluding report states that the inspec-

tion of instruments revealed much of de,ep interest, but nothing to discourage ohservers aml mechanicians in the United States from claiming equality of rank vdth any i11 skill and precision. After his return from Europe, Mr. DaYidson made a short stay at the office, aml earl.)' in December," 1878, was again at San Franci~co. The winter and spring were passed in the CO.!llJJlelion of office work, computations of former field work, and details connected with the service in Europe, and in arrangements for resuming geodetic operations in California. In some previous years Assistant DaYidson had annually repeated obserYations for the magnetic elements at San l'rancisco. The series was resumed under his direction, and the declination, dip, and intensity were observed by Assistant B. A. Colonna (luring four llays near the middle of ;\larch. The records of this work will yield important. data concerning the secular motion of the magnetic needle, which motion near the coast of California has gradually diminished t-0 a small annm1,J rate. In the course of the next twenty years it is inferred that the direction of the needle on that coast will have reached a stationary condition in which it will probably remain some years before reversing its movement. In February temporary structures were put up on the summits of Lola and Round Top for the shelter of the party and instruments, in adnmce of occupying these, the most eastern stations of the Davidson quadrilateral. Arrangements were made also for stationing heliotropes at different stations of the geodetic scheme in connection with that quadrilateral, when the condition of the snow admitted of occupyiug high stations. Subassistant E. F. Dickins joined Assistant Davidson in February, ancl was efficient in details requisite for the field operations, as was also Subassistant J. F. rratt. Assistant J. J. Gilbert joined in the micldle of May, aml on the 20th of that mouth the party set out for Mount Lola. The course lay through deep snow, but by the 7th of ,June the large theodolite was placed in safety on the summit of the mountain. There the earth was found to be frozen to the depth of two feet and a half. Bad weather dela:yed arrangements for observing, but ceased on the 12th of Jnnc, after sixty consecutive hours of snow, sleet, rain, and wind. The nights were intensely cold, and ice formed frequently to the thickness of an inch, but, notwithstanding the incidental hardships, Messrs. Colonna and Gilbert set up }Jiers for the instruments, and obser,·ations from the summit of Mount Lola were commenced on the 18th of June. All the heliotropes, e·en the most distant ones, were in view, and the prospect was fair for an early completion of the geodetic work at that station. On Mount Shasta, one hnndred and sixty-nine miles distant, Assistant Colonna made arrangement,s for mounting a l1cliotrope in tl10 course of the month, at the instance of Assistant Davidson, who confidently expected to include that station in the series of angular measurements to be recorded at Mount Lola. At the close of the fiscal year the work at that station was well advanced. The progress there and at Round Top will be stated in my next annual report. During the stay of Assistant Davidson in Europe, tlie details of business at the suboflicc in San Francisco were conducted by Assistant A. F. Rodgers. Office data and tracings required in the operations of the parties on the Pacific coast arc supplied as usual, under the direction of Assistant Davidson, by Messrs. F. "\Vestdahl and G. Farquhar. Under the supervision of l\Ir. Davidson, additional notes have been collected for the Coast Pilot of California, Oregon, au<l ·washington Territory by Assistant Gersbom Bradford, and opera· tions maintained as heretofore with tbe self-registering tide-gauge at Sauoolito. Triangulation and topography west of Fislierman1s Bay, coast of Oalifornia.-In the operations of previous years, the detailed survey of the coast of California was extended northward and westward from Point Reyes to Fisherman's Bay. The work was there resumed by Assistant L.A. Sengtellcr on the 15th of September, 1878, the plan including also the de·elopment of a scheme for the coast triangulation from Stewart's Point northward to Point Arena. In the course of the season previous to the 25th of February, 1879, the detailed topographical survey was extended from Fisherman's Bay to a point north of the entrance to the '\Yalalla River, and the tertiary triangulation (somewhat further in the same direction) was closed for the season at Haven's anchorage. In general the plane-table details include, in the stretch of coast reforred to, all features within a mile of the Pacifi.c sea-board. The ground along the inner margin of' the plane-table is represented as haYing an average elevation of seYen hundred feet. Near the northern limit of work the Walalla was traeed, and is shown as a small stream not na,vigable. It has two

North of that point the survey is continuous as far as Rocky Point, north of Trinidad Ilead. In the reconnaissance for triangulation, Assistant Sengteller kept in view the expedient of mounting the theoclolit,e on high trees, cut off at such elevation as would bring into view the outlying points that should in turn be occupied in like manner. In his party this plan hoo been successful in practice in regions that, owing to the density of the timber growth, could not otherwise be coverp,d by triangulation. Geodetic operation1>1 nortk of San Francisco, Oal.-For perfecting the system of points to be occupied in the region north of Sau Francisco, ARsistant B. A. Colonna took the field on the 5th of July, 1878, provided with instruments all(l means for determining the interYisibility of stations that had been inuicated in a general way in the preliminary examination. After makiug the requisite angular measurements on Sanel l\fountain, Mr. Colonna proceeded to ·walalla, and was there joined by Subassistant J. F. Pratt, who had previously gone northward under directions to select a station near the Pacific coast at Point Cabrillo. In order to pass the red-wood region, through which the opening of lines of sight was impossible, Mr. Colonna decided to erect a ltigh signal and platform for sustaining the tlleodolite. The details of this work were subsequently committed to Mr. Pratt, who selected a suitable tree and built around it a secure structure, with easy access to a platform one hundred and tl1irty-five foet from the ground. Above the platform a pole projects twenty-two feet, making the height of the distinctive signal available for observing four adjacent stations one hundred and fifty-seven feet. Subassistant Pratt rejoined the party at Walalla in the middle of August, and Subassiistant E. F. Dickins later in that month. Angular measur_emen1s were completed there, and at the adopted stations signals were erected, after the question of intervisibility had been settled by the use of heliotropes. On the 6th of September, 1878, the party arrived at Cold Spring, a station north ward of W alalla. vVhile the measurement of 11orizontal angles was conducted there by Subassistant Dickins, outlying stations were selected and marked by Assistant, Colonna. His course from station to station was extremely difficult, as the trails on which he mainly depended were crossed in all directions by others that terminated abruptly in places resorted to by hunters. In some instances Mr. Colonna passed the nigllt on the mountain top in order to perfect the arrangements needful at the point then under consideration as one in the geodetic series. The re.qa.isite observations were completed at Cold Spring station on the 16th of October, and on the day following the triangulation party started for the Great Caspar station. There Mr. Pratt, who had been detailed for the purpose, was about completing the construction of the high signal already mentioned, and the theodolite was mounted on its platform on the 23d of October, but the weather was then unfavorable for observing. Mr. Colonna therefore passed on to Chimise Mountain by a trail along the coast, and there stationed a heliotroper. Subassistant Pratt meanwhile remained at Great Caspar and when practicable observed on the outlying signals including :that at Chimise station, and four others to the southward. The good judgment manifested in selecting the Great Caspar as a station, and in erecting the high signal there, has been already illustrat.ed by the results. Assistant Colonna visited Lassac's Peak seventy miles to the northward and eastward of Great Caspar, and accompanied by Mr. Dickins, who acted as guide, passed the night of Novem· oo.r 2, 1878, on the summit. The height was estimated to be about six thousa.nd feet. Oa.l'eful

examination was made, and six stations to tlH· ca. .;;twm·<l, so11tltwa1·1l, aud wc.-;tw:n·1l, were ideutilied, oue of them at a distance of sixt_y-fh·e miles, but tile Great Caspar coul!l not be Reen. In going northward, and in selecting the primary poiuts, close attention was given t-0 J'1'oper connections with the tertiary triangulation 011 which the topographical survey of the eoast depends. Angular measurements were completed at Great Caspar on the 29th of November. A few days after, tlte instr.uments were mounted at Paxton Rtation. The horizontal a11d rnrtical angles required there were obtained by the 18tli of Deccmbn. After storing the propcrt.y and i11strume11ts in the court house at. -Ukial1, which in the course of operations was connected with the triangulation, the }lart;y was disbantled. The field notes show that on rcconnaisMance A:>sistaut Colonna, anti SulJassistants Dickins aud Pratt tmversed an aggregiite distance of more than twenty-six lmnclrc<l miles, much of the "ay being on mountain trails dangcrous for horflcs, and all of it difficult and laborious in travel.

The comprehensive report made by Assistant Colonna, after completing his office work and computations, contains a valuable rei·iew of tlie field of work, including its connection with the seriPs of geodetic })Oints now goi11g eastward from the vicinity of San Francisco, aQd also the exteusion of the main work northward along the coast abo\'e Shelter Cove. At the end of tbe fiscal year J\lr. Colonna and Messrs. Dickins and Pratt. we1'e assigned to field duty connected with the geodetic operations in charge of Assistant George Da\·idson. Tides at the Sandwich Isl,ands.-As mentioned ill previous annual reports, a tide-gauge of the best construction was sent from the office, at the request of .Mr. \V. D. Alexander, superintendent of the surver of the Sandwich Islands. The records of an entire year were receiyed iu return, in August, 1878, and the series of obsen1 ations will doubtless be continued further, as recording paper was sent since that date at the request of Mr. Alexander. The records of this station will in time be of much l.i1terest, in connection with the final discussion of tidal observations recorded at stati-0ns on the Pacific coast of the United States.

Triangulation of Columbia River, Oreg.-In previous years the triangulation of the Columbia was ru:lvauced to the vicinity of K<tlama.

In passing up the river, stations were selected on the banks, and when practicable the scheme of triaugnlatiou was enlarged by adopting points a few miles from the riYer. Through May and June, in heavy rains day after day, the party worked in clearing lines for sigbt. Soon after the air suddenly became very dry, and by the 1st of August the smoke was so dense that positions could not be even roughly determined iu reconnaissance. Signals on lines onJ.r four or iive miles long could not be seen. At that time the air was full of white ashc8 and scorched feru, and during September an obserYer on one Lauk of the rinit· could not sec the opposite banks, and sometimes was unable to recognize objects ouly one hundred yards distant. As before when rains prevented observations with the theodolite, the smoky season was employed iu opening lines, and 8. Ex. 17-S

At the close of the fiscal year the party was reorganized for prosecuting the topographical survey and extending the triangulation. :Triangulation of ll'ashington Sound, Wash. Ter.-Stations for this work were selected in a pre· vions season by Assistant J. S. Lawson, and, as mentioned in my last annual report, preparations were made for occupying a station at Point Partridge with the theodolite. :Much difficulty was experienced in the necessity for clearing parts of the lines leading from that station to the point 011 Smith's Island, and also to .Mount Brie, a station on J<'idalgo Island. In order to connect the larger triangulation of the sound with that of Admiralty Inlet, signals were erected at Admiralty Head, Manowstone Point, Point Hudson, Point Wilson, and at Ross, a station occupied when the triangulation of the inlet was in progress. At l'oint l'artridge observations have been greatly retarded by unfavorable conditions of the atmospheri·. On the 9th of December, 1878, the observing tent was totally destroyed b;y a furious storm, and four of the outlsing signals were thrown down.

Triangulation a1ul topography of Hood'N Canal, w-a.~h. Ter.-At the outset of the fiscal ~yBar, Assistant J. J. Gilbert htHl au vanced the triangulation, and commenced the plane-table smTe.r of the sltores of Hood'8 Canal. 'Vhcn the winter rains set in, the determination of points had heen extended as far as Hooq's Point, four miles above Seabeck. Dabop Bay and Quilcine Bay were included in the triangulation. The topography was prosecuted as far as possible while the preliminary work was in progress. A sheet was eomplete(l representing the shores in aetail between Point Uamble iuul Ha7.iel Point, and on another the :shore line of the canal was traced fo its junction with Dabop Bay. Operations with the plane-table were marle laborious by the necessity of <mtting lines of sig!Jt through the brush in order to obtain points for contouring the ground surface. In mm-iug from station to station the party used the small steam-cutter Tarry-Not. l·'iel!l work wa!ii continued until the rniudle of December, when the party was disbanded, and Mr. Gilbert returned to Olym1lia, where the steam-cutter w~ts laid up for the winter.

The topography of Carr's Inlet, for which poiuts ha!l been llt>.termined in the preceding year, was prosecuted by moving with a small sloop from the station on A nder:son Island. Late in August, 18i8, .Mr. ElliPntt moved to a s1m1U b;ty near the head of Case's Inlet, and from tltat as a workiug ce11ter pushed the triangulation of the inlet northward and westward of Heron Island. The branch known as Pickering Passage, on the northwestern si(le of Hartstein Island, was also defined by t.riangnlation. This occupied the party nntil the middle of November. A stat.ion was then select. d at Dofflemeyer Point, six miles north of Olympia, and from that position the party conducted the triangnla.tiou through Eld Inlet, Peale's Passage, and Totten Inlet, and proper1y joined with the work previously done in Pickering Passage. But little inconvenience was experienced in carrying on the field work dnring the winter. Ice forme(l while the party wa.s in Totten'.s Inlet, but- its thickneA'ls difl not exceed half an inch.

ALASKA TERRITORY.

Coast of Alaska.-Since my last annual report was closed, the preparation of material for the Coast Pilot of Alaska has been continued by Assistant ,iv, H. Dall, and tlie part descriptive of the Columbian and Alexander Archipelago is now ready for the printer. This comprises ai>out on.-.half of the coast line. Of the remaining half of the work a considerable part is in hand. The coast line of the Territory, inclU<ling that of the inner passage from the Gulf of Georgia to Fort Tongass, makes an aggregate about four times as great as that of the Atlantic coast from the northeastern boundary southward to Key West. .A. monograph of the climatology of Alaska and adjacent region, together with a list of books and charts relating to that iiart of the western hemisphere, is in the hands of the pr:iuter. This will be appended to the Coast Pilot, arnl contains isothermal and isobaric charts for each month amt for the year; illustrative diagrams of the winds; records of temperature, of rain fall, &c., at difforent stations, and a view of the magnetic and meteorological observatory at Sitka, where observations of high chamcter were recorded for many years. Papers on collateral su~jccts, especially on the anthropology an<l biology of the Alaskan region, were prepared by Mr. Dall at intervals in the course of the year, and have been accepted for publication by the Smithsonian Institution, the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences, the Zoological Society of London, and other scientific bodies. At the request of Mr. Dall, a i>aper treating of some of the Nudibranchiata obtained in bis explorations while in charge of a Coast Survey party in Alaska was prep11rcd by Dr. R. Bergh, of Cupenhagen, and has been published by the Phila<lelphia Academy of Sciences. Other papers on different groups of similar material, treating of specimen11 procured by Mr. Dall, are in preparation by eminent naturalists. In details pertaining to bis work 'OD the Coast Pilot of Alaska, Asllistant Dall has been efficiently aided by Mr. Marcus Baker.

Geodetic operatfon11 in Kentudcy.-The reconnaissance for the selection of geodetic points in Kentucky, was actively pushed by Prof. William BFd rage from the opening of the fiscal year until the midclle of October~ 1878. As stated in my last annual report, his party took the fielcl early in tlie preceding May. 'l'he difficulties and delay incident to the Sl}lection of intervisible points in a country so densely wooded and of such uniform eleYation are fully described in the field report. In the course of the season Professor rage traversed an area of four thousand square miles, and examined one hundre1l and thirty points with more or lm;s 1mccess for the progress of the work. As an expedient for identifying distant points when Yiewed from other stations, Professor Page devised a cheap form of heliotrope by joining small mirrors in pyramirlal form so as to move on a vertical axis, and attaching fonr small tin hemisphert's arranged like those of the anemometer. These signals revolved in the lightest breeze, and the flash of the mirrors could be seen on the longest lines. Including the results of the present season, the scheme of triangulation in Kentucky now extends in a northwesterly direction from the Cumberland Mountains, on tlte Virginia and Tennessee boundary line, to Louisville, on the Ohio River, with some few connecting stations on the Indiana shore. The system is made up of triangles and quadrilaterals closing at a base site a few miles southwest of Louisville. In prosecuting the work rrofessor Page used the aneroid barometer, and determined the approximate altitude of each station and of many points on routes intervening between the stations. The results will be a valuable contribution, and will aid in the future t.opogrnphical delineation of the State. Airer closing the office work incident to hi.a .field operations, Professor P.a.ge, having previously

made arrangements for taking residence in a distant State, to my regret, resignetl the charge of the geodetic work in Kentucky. .. Geodetic operations in 1'ennessee.-As stated in my last annual report, the partr of Prof. A. H. Buchanan was in the field at the opening of the fiscal year. In July, 18i8, the erection of signals, which work had lJeen begun earlier in the season, was sufficiently advanced to admit of the measurement of horizontal angles. l<Jight signals in all were constructed, ranging in height from forty to fifty feet, and in the months of August, Se1)tem!Jer, October, and part of November four stations were occupied. All the requisite angular measurements at the stations were made with a twel"rninch theodolite. The field records, original aml duplicate, and the computations connected with the work have been received at the office.

Reconnaissa.nce in Ohio.-As stated in my last annual report, arrangements were made nenr the close of the last fiscal year for commencing geodetic work in Ohio. After full conference with Assistant IUchard D. Cutts in regard to the scheme of triangulation, Prof. I:.. S. Devol took the field for reconnaissance at the end of Jnne, 1878, and continued at work until the close of September. The country between Athens and ColumlJus, a distance of seventy miles by air line, was thoroughly examined, and a chain of quadrilaterals was marked out to connect at Columbus with a site selected for a base line, and also with the astronomical station previously occupied in that vicinity. The lines of the proposed triangulation vary in length from five to twenty-two miles. The tOJlographical character of the country over which the scheme of geodetic work extends is described by Professor Devol to be, between the month of the Hocking River and Lancaster, a succession of hills of nearly uniform height-some densely wooded. Beyond Lancaster and to the north and west the hills become less abrnpt until a rolling country it:1 reached, and· finally ground almost level in the vicinity of Columbus. The general absence of prominent elevations required a very close examination before any two stations could be declared intervisible. At the close of the fiscal year .Professor Devol wa-s preparing to resume work in the field. Reoonnaisgance in India,na.-The arrangements in progrt>ss at the close of the pre,·ious fiscal ~·ear for beginning geodetic work in Indiana, were stated in my last annual re.port. After a full understanding in regard to preliminaries, Prof. J. L. Campbell took the field in the middle of June, 1878, and was occupied uutil the end of August in a carefol reconnaissance of the country between Indianapolis and New All>any, a di::1ta.nce of one hundred miles. From this examination, frequently repeated, and comparison between the natural elevations in regard to their respective advautages, twenty-one points were gradually and finally selected as stations for the llfOJ>Osed geodetic work. l>escriptions of all tl.ie stations are given in detail in the report sent in by Professor Campbell at the close of the season. , The grnund passed over in the reconnaissance presented no insuperable obstacle to the triangufation, but stations in the section north of Columbm~, which is generally level aml bears a dense forest growth, will doubtless require high artificial structures for observing with the theodolite. By these, however, the greater labor and expense of opening lines of sight will be avoided. After a. minute description of the surface features, Professor Campbell states that so far as observed the hills in Indiana resulted from denudation, the strata being for the most part horizontal. The barometric measuremeuts show that eveu iu the very hilly parts of Bartholomew and Brown Coun-

ties, the rongbei;i,t in the State, tbe summits have a very nearly uniform elevation above the sea level. Abseuce of prominent heights increased the Ja.bor of reconnaissance, and rendered longer lines impossible, yet the scheme made up of lines varying from four to twenty-two miles in length, covers a wide and important section of the State. Near New Albauy some further examination may be necessary to determine the intervisibility of a few of the stations. In the vicinity of New Albany the scheme laid out by Professor Campbell will be connected with the geodetic work of Kentucky by a base line common to both chains of triangulation. The geocletic series, after the measurement of angles in Indiana, will be continuous from the Cumber· lancl Mountains near the southwestern corner of Virginia, northward to Imliauapolis. This con· nection will illustrate the process by which a groundwork of geodetic points may be increased in number from year to year until the entire country is covered, each and all of the points being determined by tl1e same scientific and precise methods. The points, few or many, serve for correctiug the State maps, and will be 80 applied long in advance of the time at which the State allthorities may deem it expedient to provide for det~1ile(l topographical surveys. Geodetic reconnais.snncc.-At tbe opening of the fiscal year, Assistant G. A. Fairfield was engaged in examining the ground eastward of the Mississippi, for a scheme of iutervisible points in Illi'llois, to be in geodetic connection with work already extended westward from Saint Louis, l\Io. In July, 1878, a signal was put up at a station eastward of the two selected in the preceding season, and its direction from ea.ch was ascertained by flying signals, the points not being iutervisible from the ground. As heretofore, the lines were run out with the leveling instrument to determine the practicability of occupying the stations with the theodolite by erecting platforms for the instrument. Subsequently, tl1ree other points were selected for extending the work eat;itward, and the result is a practicable scheme of triangulation with lines from eight and a half to twenty-five miles long, leading from the base line measured in the autumn of 1872 on the American Bottom in Illinois for the series of triangle8 going westward. After applying all requisite tests, Mr. Fairfield reports that five stations can be occupied for angular measurements when tripod and scaffold signals are erectell at the selectt1d points, no higher ground intervening on either of the lines. He states also that the difficulties met in the vicinity of the American Bottom, on account of unusually level ground, will not so greatly impede the work in going further eastward. Field work was closed for the season on the 19th of December. Magnetic obserMtion~.-In July, 1878, after completing observations at stations in Texas and Indian Territory, of which mention has been made under the head of Section IX in this report, Snbassistant J.B. Baslor pasRed into Kansas (Section XV), Uolora<lo, and Utah Territory (Section XVI), and subsequently occupied stations in Wyoming Territory in Section XVII. The points occupied in each will be separately meutioned under tbosc respective beads. In November, 1878, Mr. Baylor reached Madison, in \Visconsin, and observed for declination, dip, an<l intensity at a point about one mile east of the University. The magnetic observatory establisl1ed in the Univer8ity gronrnls in the spring of 18i7, bas continued its records under the care of l\ir. David Mason, in accordance with the plan of operatious arranged by Assistant Charles A. Schott. Unfortunately the magnetic traces of one month were lost in the mail by accidental fire at the Chicago post-office, but, with that exception, the photographic register is complete for nearly two years, and has been submitted to discussion by Assistant Schott. Although every precaution was taken in selecting the site for this observat-0ry, the instruments are at present atfecte·l by the recent erection near it of a large building. covered with -iron shingles, but as the action of t.be. instrument.'\ is <liffer·eutial thefr proper adjustment can be again secured. Absolute measures for the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity have been recorded at this station annually since its erection, autl similar observations were made near the same place in 1876. In September, 1878, lfr. \Verner Suess recorded a series, aml in November the series was repeated b.Y Subassistant Baylor. These are intencle1l for tlte verification of earlier results which in discussion yielded an unusually large secular varh1tion. The series of observations will be repeated annually. At present it seems probable that the secular change at Madison is much greater than has been found at any Rtation along the coasts of the United States. The field report of Mr. Baylor states that his operations at the station iu the grounds of the UniYersit.y of Wisconsin were furthered by the assistance of Prof. J.B. Davies.

In Deeember, 18i8, the magnetic elements were determined at Springfield, Ill.; but the inten~ty of the cold made it impracticable to include two other stations, as intended in the iilan of operations for the year. After completing the record;;; at Spriugfield, Subassistant Baylor returned to the omce in 'Vashington. His previous observations will be mentioned under the h1>ad of Section XY. At Springfield the work, while in progress, received the friendl~· encouragement of the Hon. ,John T. Stuart and J. 0. Parsons, esq. Geodetic work in Wisconsin.-The measurement of the base line in the valley of the 'Visconsin River was remarked on in detail in my last annual report. The connection of the line with the astronomical station at Madison has been already accomplished. In the course of the present 8eason the scl1eme starting from the measured base was exteuded in a southwesterly direction, and the terminal points are on the banks of the .Mississippi Hh·er. The geodetic scheme of the fiscal year consists of four quadrilaterals, and one large octagon with sm·eral checks. Prof. J. E. Da\ies prosecuted the work here under notice during the months of July, August, September, and October. New points were intrnduced for the gradual enlargement of tlie scheme in respect of length in the triangle sides.

Geodetic operations in Missonri.-Triangulation begun in 18i2, in the vicinity of Saint Louis, has been extended westward to stations on tlie Gasconade River. The work done in the present fiscal year was conducted by Assi8tant J. A. Sullivan. Subassistant II. ,V, Blair co-operated, and in the course of the season occupied isix stations at the eastern end of the series of points selected in raconnaissance. While he was so engaged, Assistant Sullivan examined the country westward of Jefferson City, and marked out a scheme for extending the geodetic connection to stations in the vminity of Sedalia. Near Versailles, on the prairie lanil, a hase line firn miles in length was located. Tlle site is eas.r of measurement, and connect8 favorabl~' with the scheme of triangles. This line is about one hundred and fift,y miles westward of the hase line referred to in the preceding section of this re1>ort, as having be.en measured in the autumn of 18i2, on the American Bottom in Illinois. Subassistant Blair completed the me-,asurement of horizontal and vertical angles at Berger station before the close of September. After observing for azimutli, he occupied five other positions in succession, closing at Geyer Station on the 28th of November. :Mr. Isaac '\Vinston servell as :recorder. At four of the occupied stations the theodolite was mounted on scaJfoldis, some of the lines of sight not beiug clear at the <listance of a few feet above the :surface of the ground. l\Ir. Blair erected a scaffold tbirt.v foet high, and anotlter of sixty foot elevation for occupying stations in immediate connection with the points at which he closed his augular measurements in November. ln passing westward M:r. Sullivan put up signals for facilitatiug the operations of the triangulation party which will again take the field at the close of the fiscal year. After storing his instruments at Pilot Knob, Mr. Blair joined Assistant Sullivan cal'lj· in December, 1878, at Jefferson City. Tlte statistics of triangulation are:

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

In condncting the reconnaissance in Missouri the aim l1as been to obtain lines as long as the nature of the ground woulil afford, bnt much difficulty is met in maintaining the scale of work desirable for geodetic purposes. The higher elevatiom; onl.v ha,·e been used, .but in going westward the necessity of elevated structures for the theodolite will probably continue until the work is joined with tlie scheme of triangnlation in Colorado. In a general way the region westward of Sedalia, Mo., has been examined beyonrl the houndar.v line between Missouri and Kansas. Early in Decem her Assistant Sullivan discontinued field operations, and returned to the office. Subassistant Blair then t-0ok in hand and completed his computations. ,l1agneticobsermtionR.-In .lnly, 1878, Subassistant .T. B. Baylor, after closing work at stations in Texas, and Indian Territory, as already mentioned under the head of Section IX, proceeded to Kansas, aIHl in the course of that month and the following occupied five stations. .At Great Bend and at Sargent the magnetic declination, dip, aucl inten.sity were determined. .At three other }Jlaces, namely, Humboldt. Emporia, and Do1lge City, in Kansas, the observations were limited to the magnetic declination. Under the next succeeding heads ment,ion will be made of obse1·vations at other points in the interior.

Geodetic operations in Nei·ada and Utah.-For extending eastward the geodetic work mentioned under the head of Section X in this report, carefol reconnaissance has been made through Nevada and Utah, along the thirty-ninth parallel of latitude, by Assistant A. F. Rodgers. In the course of the examination, Assistant William Eimbeck was assigned to co-operate iu the selection of stations and to occupy such as might be practicable within the fiscal year. Eastward of Lake Tahoe intervisible stations were readily found, but not related so al3 to admit of' laying out a scheme in quadrilaterals going eastward. Hence, after due examination, a pentagon was adopted, the angles meeting at Genoa Peak, and, in geodetic connection with it, two hexagons, the middle stations of which are within a few miles of the thirty-ninth parallel. By fourteen intervisible stations the work will be advanced due east to a distance of four hundred and fift.y miles from the California boundary. Assistant Eimbeck passed the mouth of October in the measurement of horizontal angles at Pah-Rah, a station connecting with the Davidson quadrilateral. · The adjustment of the scheme of triangulation necessitated the ascent many mountains exelush-e of the positions finally adopted. At each of' the peaks, .Assistant Rodgers carefully. measured the angles made by lines leading to others, and sketched the outlines of the horizon near the identified stationi:s, and the mountain masses iut.ervening betwt>,en them and the point of observation. The summits visited for purpoi!es of reconnai~ance range in height from eight thousand to upwards of twelve thousand feet. Aft~r traveling in the aggregate more than two thousand miles; Assistant Rodgers closed field operations on the 7th of November, 1878, and reported in person at the office in Washington. At the close of the fiscal year Assistant Eimbeck made preparation for occupying stations of the pen- · tagou in Nevada. Assistant.UodgerR at the same time arranged for extending the coast triangula·. tion of Northern California. Until he took the field for ret:',onnaissance in Nevada, Mr. Rodgers directed details in the sub-office at San .Francis<',o, the charge deYolviug on him at the departure of Assistant Davidson for the International Exposition at Paris. Recon·na·issance for geodetic points in Colorado.-In the preceding section mention was made of the progress in triangulation along the thirty-ninth parallel across the State of Missouri, and of the selection of points for continuing the work westward. For p~rfecting in advance a scheme of geodetic connection, the region along that pamllel in Colorado wa,s examined in the course of the fiscal year by .Assistant 0. H. Tittmann. After visiting Pike's Peak, Platte Peak, and Mount Morrison, search was made for the site of a base line to connect properly with a scheme of triangulation rnuning east. and west. The line finally selected ·is nea,r the thirty-ninth parallel, about fifteen miles northeast of Colorado Springs, and affords a length of se,·en miles, requiring for measurement only the removal of large tufts of grass along the liI1e.

Eastward of the base site, Mr. Tittmann selected eleven stations for extending a series of triangles in that direction to 11oints beyond the Kamias Pacific Itailroad. Iu general the region does not ofter the facilities desirable for geodetic operations in a given direction, the drainage beiug nearly parallel with "the proposed scheme of triangulation. Of thirteen stations selected east and west of the base site, observing scaffolds will be required at fuur, varJing in height from thirty to forty feet. Tripods were erected at eight stations, which in succession will be occupied by Assistant Tittmann, whose party was reorganized for that purpose at the close of tlie fiscal year. In field operations Mr. J. E. l\foGrath served as recorder. The party was disbanded on the 22d of November, 1878, when Mr. Tittmann resumed duty in the office. In a favorable position at Bijou Basin, in Elbert County, Colorado, Assistant Tittmann observed the solar eclipse of July 29, 1878, confining himself principally to nofo1g the d11mtion of totality. At the moment of greatest obscuration Mount Evans was distinctly seen, though fifty.eight miles distant. The place of observation was ap1woximately determined in position by reforeuce t-0 known points of the Hayden survey. Mr. William Ferrel, of the office, being at the same time in the vicinity, observed the eclipse from the summit of Gray's Peak, a.tan clmration upwards of fourteen thousand feet al:Jove the sea level. The appearance of the corona, and the phenomena generally, were carefully observed and described in a report from Mr. Ferrel, but no special provision had been made in regard to instrumental out· fit by himself or lfr. Tittmann. Several other qualified observers, not connected with the survey, noted the moon's passage across the disc of the sun, but no two of the Colorado observers agree in descriptions or drawings of the coronal features. ltfagnetic observations.-As mentioned in the preceding section, S11bassistant J. B. Baylor recorded magnetic observations, in August, at several stations in Kansas. Before the close of that month he passed into Uolorado, and determined the magnetic declination, dip, aml intensity at North Pueblo and at Denver. The declination of the magnetic needle was determined subse· quently in the vicinity of Fort Lyon, and also at Colorado Springs and Greeley, in Colomdo. After completing his record of observations at other places, of which mention will be made under the head of Section XVll, Mr. Baylor occupied stations at Castle Rock, Ogden, aml Salt Lake City, in Utah; at the first two determining the declination, and at Salt Lake City the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity. Under preceding heads mention has been made of the earlier ousernttions of S u.bassistant Baylor. The determinations in Utah were made in October, 1878. SECTION XVII.
MONTANA, IDAIIO, AND WYOMING.-(SKETCH No. 31.)

Magnetic observations.-U11der preceding heads twenty-six stations have been mentioned at which the magnetic declination was determined in the course of the season b~' Subassistaut J. B. Baylor. In September, 1878, he passed into Wyoming Territory, and before tlie clmm of that month determined the declination at Laramie City, Rock Creek, Ureston, and Point of Rocks. All the magnetic elements were determined by observations at Che~1 cnne, :Fort Steele, Green Riyer, and Carter. Mr_ Baylor closed operations in Wyoming Territ-0ry late in October, and was subsequently engaged at other places, as already stated, until the 13th of December, 1878, when he reported at the office in Washington. Ile is now employed in similar duty in Section I. At Fort Steele, in Wyoming Territory, Subassistant Baylor had the useful co-operation of Surgeon Calvin De Witt, U. S. A., who is stationed at that post.

Hcports of the execution of the important public duties committed to Assistant Hilgard while abroad liave been prepared by him, and will be in readiness for publication at an early date. As a member of the Interuational Committee on "\Veights and Measures, he was instructed to co-opera,te with that bod;y in perfecting tlie organization anll assist in initiating· the practical working of its establishment near Paris. He dsiterl London to make a recomparison of the Coast Survey standard yard (Bronze :X o. 11) with the British lmperial standard, and appeared as a representative of the Ooast and Geodetic Survey at the annual session of the Lnternational Geodesic Association, held last year at Hamburg. No essential change took place in the organization of the office throughout the year. Assistant Edward Goodfellow remained on duty, aiding the Assistautin Charge in administrative details aml in the office.correspondence. Efficiency of administration is maintained by the active co-operation of the chief's of the several clivisions, by their immediate responsibility to the Assistant in Charge, and by monthly reports, stating in detail the occupation of each person employed. · All records and computations of the field work of the survey are sent to the office, with a view to their discm;sion and verification by such scientific methods as may be established with tlle approval of the Superintendent. These records or computations may relate to the preliminary work of reconnaissance; to astronomical and magnetic observations; to measurements of bases; to the primary, secondary, and tertiary triangulations and azimuth determinations conl!ected therewith; to observations of tides, and to topoi,'I·aphy and hydrography in the forms of topographic and hydrogra1ihie field slieets. Upon the receipt of these records, and after acknowledgment duly made to the officer trarn!rnitting them, they are referred for action by tlie Assistant in Charge to the chiefs of divisions in the office. Some special scientific investigations were prosecuted by Mr. Hilga,rd, as opportunity offered, with the aid of field officers temporarily assigned to office duty. Under his direction, Assistant H. G. Ogden examined the grad nation of the limb of twent,y-fo11r-inch tbeo1lolite U.S. C. and G. S. No. 2; made comparisons of twenty-four thermometers with a Kew standard; ma<le a series of experiments with the prismatic salinometer, designed by Mr. Hilgard; determined the relative lengths arnl expansions of the Committee meter, iron meter No. 6, steel meter No. 19, and the JJeuoir iron meter at temperatures ranging from 370 to 810 Fah.; took a series of observations for determination of the errors of reading the telemeter in field work, and for ascertaining the errors of incidental determination of a vertical lllane. He made ahio a series of micrometric readings for testing the graduation of the limb of theodolite ~o. 118, and supervised the preparations for marking foe ends of the trial ba.se line established at Arlington, with a view to its preliminary measurement, comparing for this purpose the new sixmeter measuring rods with the standard six-meter bar. Mr. Ogden was detached for field duty towards the eml of June. A11:sistant \Villiam Eimlwck reporte1l to the office e:~rly i11 ,Jaunary, and was directed to make a complete series of mag-netic obRmTatiom; for the irn~tr1tctio11 awl practice of one of the naval otlicens assigne<l to dnty on the Cuu,st and Geodutic Surve;y. Ile then made a special set of obset·va· tious for testing vertical circle No. 100, and, upon the completion of the computations required for the adjustment of his ti'iangulation in ~evada, made a design for and description of monuments for marking the terminal points of a base line; also, a design and description of two instrumeuts for referring the ends of base bars to the groundmarks of primary base lines during measurement. After assisting in an examination of the Arlington trial base-line with a view to its extension, and in the comparisons of the six-meter standard bar, Mr. Eimbeck then begun a collection of maps nnd data needed for arranging the plan of a magnetic survey in California and Nevada, Oregon and ·washington Territory, and was occupied in other preparations for fielJ. work till he left the office late in June. Assistant 0. H. Tittmann, upon reporting early in January for office duty, was direete1l to take up a revision of the list of latitude stars (two hundred and fifty-eight in number) included ill the Coast Survey "Catalogue of Stars for Observations of Latitude," in regard to the places of which more accurate determinations were t-0 be made at some of the leading observatories.

complcte<l, he made comparisons of relati,·e length between the standard Uritish well-yards bronze No. 11 and iron No. 57; arranged and reduced the obscrYatious marle by .Mr. Hilgard in London for the comparison of standard yard brouze No. 11 with the Imperial standard ~o. 1 aml the accessible standard Xo. G; compared two six-meter snbsidhiry base rods with the six-meter comparing bar; made an examination of the newly-constructed geoclesic level No. 3, and determined its constants; supervised arrangements for comparing the primary ba8c apparatm; at a high temperature, and commenced the c;ompilation of that portion of' the report of standard weights and measures relating to comparisons of measures of length, ;yards among themselves and_ meters among themselves. About the 20th of ,Tune he began the pre1mration of a subsidiar·y base apparatus aml other appliances for the work as>1igned to him in Colorado. Subassistant Andrew Braid reported for duty at the office in April; aided Assistant Ogden in the observations made for errors of determination of a vertical plane; examined the magnetic observations of' Professor Nipher. of Saint Louis; redetermined constants for geodesic le\"el No. 1; ran trial lines of levels with geodesic levels Nos. 1 aud 3, and aided in experiments with difl'el'ent forms of telemcwr rods. Early in June, Mr. Braid entered upon duty preparatory to resuming field work. Subassist.ant H. W. Bl_air, who reported for office duty January 15, tissisted Mr. Tittmann in comparisons of the standard yards; arranged and classified papers relating to weights and measures; made the verification of a set of grain weights for the United States mint at Philadelphia, and dcwrmined the values of a set of metric weights (kilogram to milligram) for the New Orleans mint; discussed the comparisons of relatiYe lengths and expansions of the Committee meter iron No. 6, Lenoir iron meter, and swel meter Xo. 19; detel'mined the lengtll of four sample pieces of steel for experiments in regard to their expansion to be made in France; made a determination of the absolute and relative lengths of the Rrnnner centimeter scale, and the new centimeter scale of the Coast and Geodetic Survey; revised and prepared for printing the Bache F1md Magnetic Observations, and tested the office regraduation of theodolite No. 118. Towards the close of June he took up work preparatory for field duty. Mr. F. 11. Parsons, aid, assisted Mr. Blair in his examination of theodolite No. 118, and, under Mr. Hilgard's immediate direction, was occupied in compilations of records for the Bureau of Weights and Measures, in experiments with a drop cylinder specimen cup, in comparisons of thermometers with a Kew standard, and in other miscellaneous work. Hgdrographic Division.-The direction of the Hydrographic Division has remained with Commamler E. P. Lull, U. S. N., whose labors as H~'drographic Inspector have been referred to elsewhere in this report. As chief of this division, he inspects all records and results of h;yrlrographic work; directs the protracting, plotting, and drawing of the hydrographic sheets, their verification by comvarisoa with the original tidal, sounding, and current records, and their reduction to the scales of publication, taking care that such a selection from the soundings is made as to keep in view their equal distribution with special reference to a correct representation ot' the depths. A verification of the reduced drawings with the tidal, sounding, and current notes, positions of buoys, &c., completes the office work required in this division to prepare a chart for the engraver or photolithographer. The Hydrographic Inspector performs also the duty of maintaining the correctness of' the aids to navigation shown on the charts by taking cognizanc-0 of all changes in or additions to buoys, beacons, and lights that are made by the Light-House Service, and preparing guide-copies for engraving the same on the plates, and entering them on the printed editions on hand in the maproom. The changeable nature of the channels on the greater part of our coast occasions a very frequent necessity for corresponding changes in tlie aids to navigation. Commander Lull had the aid of Lieut. Commander Philip H. Cooper from July 5 to November 8, 1878, and of Lieuts. Henry E. Nichols and John l\I. Hawley, the former from February 1 to June 30, and the latter from February 1 to April 9, 1879. The work of the byclrographic draughtsmen may be summarized as follows : Mr. E. Willeubucher protracted, plotted, and drew fifteen hydrographic sheets, verified, inked, and finished seven, and plotted and drew additional hydrography upon five sheets.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

Mr. W. C. ~Willcnlmcher plotted and drew eighteen hydrographic sheets, verified and inked :five sheets, and brought up to 1late the progress sketclies for the annual report. During August, September, anil part of October he was employed as hydrogmphic draughtsman with the party of Assistant Junken on the Delaware River. Mr. F. C. Donn was assigned to duty as draughtsman in this division October 15, and was engaged in miscellaneous tracings and reductions, and during three months in the preparation for publication of a table of depths. He plotted, verified, and inked eleven hydrographic sheets. Computing Dirision.-The Computing Division was in charge of Assistant Charles A. Schott throughout the year. All original and duplicate rel:ords of geodetic observations, with the field computation of results, after being duly registered in the office, are sent to .M:r. Schott, who makes an examination of them to ascertain whether they are in accordance with the established forms, reports serious irregularities or deficiencies, and has the field computations checked by an entirely independent office computation, the results of these discussions beiug from time to time brought to the attention of the Assistant in Charge. Discussions of sufficient importance, or such reports relating to the methods and results of the Survey as are deemed wortby of publication, are referred to the Superintendent for ultimate action. Such final results of the labors of this division as are needed for constant office reference are preserved in the form of mgisters, in which are systematically arranged all data relating to stand· ards of length, to base lines, to azimuths, to determinations of g·eographical position, to heights of' stations, arnl to determinations of the magnetic elements, absolute or relative. Mr. ,Schott gave his personal at.tention to the preparation of data for the construction of charts aml for the use of field parties, and to replies to requests for information, especially on subjects connected with terrestrial magnet.ism. He completed two registers arranged by States and Terri· tories-one containing results of all astronomical azimuths measured, the other relating to the measuring apparattts used on the surrny, aIHl giving resulting lengths of all base lines measured to date. Under his direction, Mr. ,V. Suess 8et up aucl put in complete working order a set of Kew magnetographs, by which it was intended to obtain at a station upon the Pacific coast a continuous register of the changes of the magnetic declination, and of the horizontal and vertical components of the magnetic force. 'fhe instrumental constants for the magnetograph were determined by Mr. Schott. He made also, with the aid of Assistant Birnbeck, the usual annual magnetic observations at the station on Capitol Hill; discussed the secular chauge of the magnetic declination, as modified by the latest available results, with a v-iew to the preparation of a third edition of his paper upon the "secular chauge,'1 and directed the work at the magnetic observatory, Madison, Wisconsin. Additions made during the year to the force of computers gave Mr. Schott increased facilities for efficient work in the di vision, and enabled him to devote personally more time to general discussions and reports. Details of the labors of the computers are as follows : Mr. ,Tames l\fain computed the latitude of the following stations: Summit, Cal.; Moore, N. C.; King, N. C.; Mount Diablo, Cal. Revised the latitude of Elliot's Knob, Va., and of Lebanon, Tenn. Computed the astronomical azimuths of Mount Diablo, Cal.; Elliot's Knob, Va.; Mount Helena, Ual.; Vicksburg, Miss.; Helena, Ark.; fort near Vieksburg, Miss.; Donaldsonville, La.; Lebanon, Tenn.; harbor, San Clemente Island, Cal., and Catalina Peak, Cal.; and computed the telegraphic difference of longitude between Summit Station, Cal., and Washington, D. C., and San Francisco, Cal. In accordance with special arrangement five hours' labor constitutes his day's work. Dr. Gottlieb ltumpf computed the followingjl~COndary and tertiary triangulations, viz: Puget Sound, between Nisqually and Budd's Inlet, Wash. Ter.; of Budd's Inlet, Wash. Ter.; Coney Island, N. Y.; Jamaica Bay, N. Y.; Barataria Bay, La.; Indian River, Fla.; Saint John's River, .Fla.; vicinity of Cape Cana\·e1·al, Fla. Comput~d the positions of light-houses on the coast of Massachusetts, Rl1ode Island, Connecticut, and New York, and attended to miscellaneous geodetic work. After March 12 he was detached from the Computing Division for special duty. Mr. Edward H. Oolll'tenay was engaged in computing the supplementary triangulation near Philadelphia; computed ·the annual magnetic observations at ~ladison, Wis., and the magnetic

Baylor aml Braid; had charge of copying and the care of the duplicate records; directed work of some of the temporary computers; attended to rlata for field parties and to the geographical registers of the office; assisted in the preparation of the annual statistics, and made progress with the computation of' the triaugulation on the Upper Potomac. Mr. M:yTick II. Doolittle was engaged on the least square adjustment of' the primary triangulations between Georgia and Alabama, and between Maryland and Georgia, following in general the Blue Rirlge; developed the secondary triangulation between San Pedro and Newport Bay, Cal., on Clarke's spheroid; a<ljm;ted the primary triangulation vicinity of Eastport and Calais, Me.; computed the length of the Lebanon base, Tennessee, the Spring Green base, Wisconsin, ancl the Daughtry Island base, Florida; computed the vertical angles and heights of the primary and sec· ondary stations of the Inue Ridge triangulation between Maryland aml Georgia; prepared abstracts of directions at stations Elliot's Knob, Va., Mount Helena, Cal., and made good progress witll the adjustment of the primary triangulation between Charleston and Sa,'mmah. Dr. Jermain G. Porter aRsisted Mr. Doolittle in the solution of numerous normal equations arising from adjustment of principal triangulations; com1mted sides and positions (on Ularke's spheroid) of the primary and secondary triangulation of' Santa Barbara Channel, and the same for the primary and secondary triangulation bet,ween Maryland and Georgia, along the Blue Ridge. He assisted J'tir. Doolittle also in the adjustment of the triangulation near Eastport, Me., and took part in the preparation of horizontal directions at Elliot's Knob, Ya., and Mount Diablo, Cal.; computed subordinate triangulations near Staunton, Va., and near Simonton College, N. ().; and assisted in the computation of heights of the Blue Ridge surny. Mr. Marcus Baker was assigned to duty in the Computing Division September 17, and has since been engaged on the computation of the telegraphic difference of longitude between \\~ashington and Savannah, Ga.; and Savannah and Atlanta, Ga.; and made progress (reduction of transit observations at Washington) with the difference of longitude between ~Washington and Atlanta. He was on leave of absence for one mouth and gave but fiye hours a day to the Computing Division, being on other duty for the remainder of bis official time. He also collected magnetic results relating to the Territory of Alaska. Mr. Alexander S. Christie reported for duty January 15, and has since been engaged on the computation of the following astrnnomical latitt1des: l\fount Helena, Cal.; Elliot's Knob, Va.; Aurora, Ala.; Lebanon, Term.; and made progress with the latitude of Nashville, Term. Mr. Erasmus D. l>reston was assigned tu duty in the division toward the close of the 1hical year (June 24), and commenced the reduction of transit ohserrntions for time and longitude at Washington, D. C., in connection with the longitudes of Atlanta, Ga., and Statesville, N. C. '.fhe following computers and writers were temporarily connected with the Computing Di vision, and their work may be briefly snmmedup as follows: · Assistant Edwin Smith was engaged between November 1 and November 12 in preparing h()rizontal directions obsened at l\fount J)iablo, Ca1., and Monnt Helena, Cal. Mr. P. Lobanoff was engaged in reading oft' and tabulating llhotographic traces of the magnetic observatory at Madi.son, Wis. His connection with the survey ceased October 15. Mr. F. A. Sawyer was engaged upon miscellaneous computations and copying, especially of geographical positions, and revised spirit-levelling reductions. Mr. B. F. Warren was engaged in computation of triangle sides and positions during four days in November. Mr. R. A. Marr wa.s aM1igned to duty November 11, and after making himself familiar with ordinary geodetic computations, com1mted tile secondary triangulation of Laguna Madre, Tex., computed a number of geographical posit.ions ot tertiary o~jects in tbe Blue mdge triangulation between Maryland aml Georgia, iu;;sisted Dr. Porter in miscelbneons geodetic computations, and made progress in preparing abstract of' horizontal directions at staions of the coast ttriangulation of California., north of San Francisco. He was assigned to field duty June 24. Mr. J. E. McGrath reported for duty December 12, an<l acquired familiarity with triangle side

and 1iosition computations. Ile was principally engaged in reading off and tabulating photographic traces and some thermometric registers taken at the magnetic ohservatory at Madison. This ardn· ous dut.Y lte performed with rapidity and in a satisfactory manner. Mr. Isaac "\VinRton was assigned to duty January 2, and was chieflJ· engaged in miscellaneous copJ·ing and on plain geodetic computations aml re\isions under Mr. Courtenay's direction. He also assisted in preparing data for field parties. He was transferred to field duty June 24. Mr. Carlisle Terry,jr., reported fordnty Januar:,' 6. He was occupied with miscellaneous writing and in inserting geographical positions in the office registers; computed apparent places of stars for latitude work at eight stations and aided Assistant Ogden on field work for a few days. l\fr. T. E. Norelins was assigned to duty in this division May 21, and was engaged in reading oft' chronograph sheets, under Mr. Baker's direction, and upon miscellaneous clerical duty. Tidal Division.-Mr. R S. A very has had charge, as heretofore, of the Tidal Division. To him are referred records of tidal observations, consisting either of t,idal curves automatically recorded on self-registering tide-gauges, or of readrngs of the height of ticle on tide-stafl:s, records of the establishment of bench-marks, and the observers' tabulations of heights and times of high and low waters. The results of the office discussion of these observations appear in the form of tide tables for charts, and in the tables of tidal data for the principal sea-ports of the United States, published annually a year in advance, the laws of tidal action upon onr coast having been determined by long series of observations with sufficient accuracy to admit of the prediction of times and heights. Tide-Tables for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts for 1879 were published in August, 1878. In the following table are given the localities of the principal stations (all self-registering, with one exception) from which records have been receiYed during the year. Hecords of short series of tidal observations, received from the hydrographic parties, have been referred to in the statements of hydrographic work under the heads of the several sections.

The self.registering gauges established at Clarke's Point, Mass., and at Block Island, were intended as reference stations for the tidal survey of Buzzard's Bay, observations every fifteen minutes with glass tube box-gauges being made simultaneously at eight other stations for shorter periods, genera1ly about six days. The self-registering stations at Governor's Island, New York Harbor, and at Fortress Monroe, Va., having been discontinued, both series are ready for discussion. In view of the speedy resumption of observations at the Fernandina station, Mr. A very renews the recommendation made in a former report for the establishmeut of a station at the Bermuda Islands, in order that data may be obtained for comparison of the ocean tides with those of the coast. In the office work of reductions and other computations, Mr. A very bad the assistance of the following-named persons : Mr. John Downes was chiefly engaged in the tabulations, reductions, and prediction of tides for the Atlantic coast. Mr. L. P. Shidy reduced many short series of observations received from hydrogmphic parties; predicted for ports at w bicb tl1e diurnal inequality was large, and aided in discussions and mi.8cellaneous work.

Miss M . .Thomas att;ended to the simpler computations and to cop_ying; Mrs. M. E. Nesbitt and Miss Turnbull were similarly employed. Drawing Division.-The scales upon which the topographic and hydrographic sheets are executed being usuallj· ruhU-, 20tnr0 , and 40h 0 , while the published charts vary in scales from 20 600 to 120l 000 , a project is prepared for e\·ery chart, in which are defined the limits of the sheets from which it is to be reduced. These projects are based upon sheets which have been approved for registry after passing the careful scrutiny given to them in this division. If the cllart is intended to be engraved, the engraver is furnished with a reduced drawing, such details as may be general· ized being supplied by photographic reductions upon which the character of the topography is indicated by conventional signs. Charts' intended to be published hyphotolithography arc drawn in full detail, and either the original drawings, or tracings from them, supplied for reduction in the camera. Mr. W. T. Bright, in charge of this division, has kept it up to its usual degree of efficiency, all special calls for information having been promptly met. Apµendix No. 3, which gives a statement of copies of charts and maps and other data furnished, shows also how various are the demands made upon the office for results of the work of the sur\-ey. In Appendix ~o. 4 will be found a detailed statement of the charts completed or in progress during the year for which tllis report is prepared, with the name of the drauglltsman who executed the work. Projections have been furuished to field parties and drawings ma<le for illustrations t-0 the annual rcrwrt. The distribution of work among the draughtsmen and other persons employed bas been as follows: Mr. A. r~indenkoh1, chief draughtsman, has, as usual, reduced all the new material for the small scale sailing-charts, as well as that for the gcneml charts of the coast, and the numerous coast charts upon ~he 1ioi 00 scale; kept up to date the annual additions to the progress sketches, and constructed upon copper the projections necessary for new charts of large extent. :Mr. II. Lindenkohl has been empfoyed in reducing the material for habor charts of various se,a,Ie.s, compiling and drawing charts for photolithographic publication, and upon engra·dngs npou st-0ne of sketches and illustrations for the. annual report. l\lr. L. Karcher has continue(! upon the hydrographic recluctions for coast and harbor charts, and supplied a large number of field projections, diagrams, and tracings. }fr. 0. Junken made hydrographic <lrawings, field projections, copper-plate projections, and indicated the longitudes corrected for the latest telegraphic determinations upon the Illates of a number of charts. In August he was asRigned to make a hydrographic resurvey of a portion of the Delaware River, in the vicinity of Cherry Island Flats, upon the completion of which, in Oetober, he was again attached to the division. Mr. P. Erichsen has been engaged chiefly in drawing for publication in the annual reports, plans and viewR of many new and improved instruments of precision, upon hydrographie reductions, and upon topographical details upon engTarnd o~tlines of harbor charts. Mr. B. ,J. Sommer has drawn for publication by phot-Olithography se\·eral small harbor chart1-1, and has made re1lnced drawings for the 80-fi-00 scale charts. :\fr. C. A. Meuth was employed upon the miscellaneons wor·k of the dhrision until February, when he resigned. Messrs. H. Eichholtz and E. Molkow have continued to supply, by liand, to the chart room editions the aids to navigation that were placed after the editions were printed. Miss C. B. Turuhull was gh·en employment in miscellaneous duties from October until May, when she was assigned to the tidal division. Mr. T. L. Moore did practice work in the division from March until May, when he left tlie office. It has heret-Ofore been the practice that the original topographical sheets, drawn with hard pencil in the field, were subsequently inked by the persons who had made the survey. This course, while it has the advantage that the final drawing is done with personal knowle<lge of the ground, has the disadvantage on the other hand that good surveyors are not always good ilmughtsmen, which resulted in very unequal style of representation on the .original maps. This was, indeed, not a matter of great moment so long as for purposes of pttblication these maps were redrawn in the office, generally on reduced scales. But since the perfection of the processeR of reproduction by photolithography and other modes based upon photography, renders 1)facticable the pnuli· cation of maps obtained directly from the original drawing, either on the same or on a rednceil scale, it has become desirable t-0 have the drawing matle in a suitable and uniform style. \Vith a

ImrORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

view to this end Assistant E. Hergesheirner was instructed to prepare specimens of drawing, on the scale of the original sheets of the various topographical featn.res to be represented, to serv·e as a guide for the draughtsmen in the office who will hereafter ink the original sheets. Mr. Herges· heimer has tlischarged this dut,y with great snccess, as will be seen from the specimens and cxplan· atory text appended to this report. (Appendix No. 11.) Engraving Division.-Assistant J. S. Bradford had charge of the Engraving Division during the year. The system of engraving adopted in the office is the result of a careful study of the methods of topographical and hydrographical tlelineation which ham been found most effective for representing the varied features of lantl and water upon the maps and charts. In the :finished coast and harhor charts a high degree· of artistic as well as of mechanical skill is required for the adequate representation of the· undnlating formations, hold slopes, and broken or irregular contours of the coast line. The style of lettering must also be selected with a view to good effect, and be made to conform to the several scales of publication, and the arrangement of title and explanatory notes must be studied in forming a project for each chart. Careful inspection is made of the progress and quality of work upon the plates by proofs taken quarter]~·, which are suhmitted for inspection to the Superintendent and to the Assistant in charge of the office; final proofs being taken upon the completion of every plate for ap1lroval before puhlication . .Mr. Bradford reports that twelve chart plates have been completed, eight begun, and work upon nineteen continued during the year. Corrections and additions were matle upon one hundred and sixty-six plates, including those of the charts for the Atlantic Coast Pilot. For the same work, the engraving of twenty-six views was nearly finished. In the assignment of work the aptitude of each man for that branch of engraving in which he is most skilled must bf\ kept in view. The force of tlte division remained about the same as last year: Messrs. J. Entboffer, H. 0. E··ans, A. Sengtt1ller, J. J. Young, W. A. Thompson, and RF. Bartle w~re continued as topographical engravers; E. A. l\faedel, A. Petersen, H. M. Knight, J. G. Thompson, ancl F. Courtenay as letter engravers, and E. H. Sipe, WlTh H. Davis, Th. ·wasserbach and A. C. Ruebsam, as miscellaneous engravers. Mr. J. J. Young was employed during a large part of the year in etching views for the Coast Pilot; and Mr. George McCoy upon standard topographical specimens from the originals by Assistant Hergesheimer. Appendix No. 5 gives a detailed statement of the work of the several engravers upon the Jllates completed, continued, or begun during the year. The clerical duties of the division were satisfactorily performed by Messrs. Leeds C. Kf'rr and Jno. H. Smoot. Electrotpying and Phowgrapking Divisi-On.-The engraved plates being the standard plates which it is desirable to preserve unimpaired, but a small number of proofs are taken from each before subjecting them to the process of electrotyping, by which the slow labors of the engraver are multi1,lied rapidly and with perfect :fidelity. As soon as the standard plate is ready for an alto, it is sent to the Electrotyping Division, the operations of which are in charge of Dr. Anton Zumbrock. After being cleaned by rubbing with soft canton flannel, precipitated chalk and water, it is ready for being rubbed with a solution of argento-cyanide of silver, this rubbing being continued until the plate is evenly silvered; the s1irface is then washed with water; the plate drained; any water remaining washed oft' with alcohol; and then there is poured over and allowed to dry on it a weak solution (straw-colored) of iodine in alcohol. This process was devised some years ago in the office, and has proved entirely successful in preventing adhesion between the standard plate and the alto obtained from it in the battery. From the alto, bassos or printing plates are produced as they are needed. Dr. Zumbrock has made also \he photographic reductions from drawings or from field sheeta required for the use of the engravCJ:"s and draughtsmen, duplicate photographs being taken, one upon glass for the engraver to be used in tracing outlines and contours, another on paper for the draughtsman, so that there may be shown upon it the colors and conventional signs adopted in detail representation. Twenty-six uegatiYes, nine positives, and one hundred and six.teen prints were t.aken during

the year. Fifty altos and thirty-three bassos were made, inclucling four altos for the Hydrographlo Office, United States Navy. The batteries for the office sympathetic clocks and call-bell were kept in order. All of the collorlion, varnish, silver solutions, and other preparations used in the work were made in the laboratory. Dr. Zumbrock was assisted as heretofore by Mr. Frauk Over. Miscellaneous Division.-Under this head are classified those branches of office work which relate to the printing and distribution of the charts, reports, and other publications of the survey, the charge of the official blank forms and stationary and their supply for office and field use, the care of the office building, and the general direction of work in the carpenter shop; of the details of these duties Mr. M. W. \Vines has had charge. He attended to the systematic distribution of the reports of the Superintendent t-0 the several departments of the Government, and to the principal scientific associations, colleges, and public libraries in the United States and foreign oountries; also to the calls made for charts, Coast Pilots, and Tide Tables from the sale agencies established in all of the principal sea-ports. ~'ollowing is a list of the publications of the survey received during the ;rear, comprising, it will he seen, a number of extra copies of papers embodying the methods and re1mlts of the work, which are published as appencliccs t-0 the annual reports. Due d_istribution was made of these imblications, the extra copies of appendices being freely furnished t-0 applicants. One thousand copies Tide Tables for the Pacific coast of the United States for 1879. Two thousand copies Tide Tables for the Atlantic coast of the United States for 1879. Three hundred copies Notice to Mariners, No. 17. Five hundred copies .Atlantic Coast Pilot-Boston to New York. Two lnrndred oopies Atlantic Local Coast Pilot-Boston to }fonomoy. Two hnndred copies Atlantic Local Coast Pilot-Nantucket and Vineyard Sounds. Two hundred copies Atlantic Local Coast Pilot-Buzzard's and Narragansett Bays. Two hundred copies Atlantic Local Coast Pilot-Block Island and Fisher's Island Sounds and Gardiner's and Peconic Bays. Two hundred copies Atlantic Local Coast Pilot-Long Island Sound and East River. Two hundred copies Atlantic Local Uoast Pilot-Harbors in Long Island Sound. Two hund;ed copies Atlantic Local Coast Pilot--Soutli coast of Long Island, New York Bay and Hudson River. Two hundred and fifty copies On Registration of Tides-Appendix No. 8, Report for 1876. Five hundred copies Notice to Mariners, No. 14, second edition. Fiv"e hundred copies A Catalogue of Stars for Observations of Latitude-Appendix No. 7, Report for 1876. One hundred copies Review of the Characteristics of the South Pass-Appendix No. 12, Report for 1876. One hundred copies Report on the Physical Survey of New York Harbor-Appendix No. 10, Report for 1876. There were distributed during the year from the chart room, under the immediate care of l\Ir. Thomas McDonnell, twenty-three thousand two hundred and thirteen copies of charts. Of this number twelve thousa.nd two hundred and seventy-one copies were sent to sale agents, and seven thousand five hundred and forty-two copies were for the use of the several de1>artments of the goverrnnen t. Sixteen thousand seven hundred and nine copies of charts were received from the printer, all of these being copper-plate impressions; in addition to these there were sent to the chart room twelve thousand four hundred and ninety-two copies of charts published by the processes of lithography. Mr. Frank l\foore,assisted by Messrs. D. N. Hoover and J. S. Beck, executed the printing from the copper plates; Mr. H. Nissen attended to the preparation of backed drawing paper for field sheets, and to the miscellaneous work of the foltling room. Ile had the aid of Mr. I~ T. Bassett after June 1. Arckives.-The care of the original records of the survey in the fire-proof building provided for the purpose remained with Mr. G. A. Stewart. These records are Rystcmaticall;v registered as soon as received, the t-Opo6raphic and hydrographic sheets being numbered in order of registry. S. Rx. 17--10

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT, ETC.

Duplicate records of observations are, for convenience of cornmltation, kept in the Uom puting Division. Fifteen topographic and fifty-one hydrographic sheets were received and registered during the year, making the total number of topographic sheets registered to the close of the year fourteen hundred and sixty-five, and the total number of hydrographic sheets fourteen hundr~d and two. Of original records and computations, eight hundred and eighty-five volumes were added to the archives; and of duplicate records, four hundred and sixty-six voh1mes. Library.-The office library, consisting mainly of books of reference, and of publications of a scientific character received.i.n. exchange for the publications of the Survey, was in charge of Mr· Samuel Hein. The library now contains nearly four thousand titles and volumes. Two hundred and eighty.one volumes and four hundred and fifty-two copies of pamphlett! and periodicals were received during the year. Instrument Room.-The instrument room was in charge of M:r. G. N. Saegmuller, chief mechanician. Under his direction were made, as far as practicable, the repairs of all instruments required for field and office use, and such instruments of precision were constructed as were needed for the more exact processes of geodesy. Accountability for instruments furnished to field parties is secured by returns made at the end of every season by each chief of party of all instruments retained in his possession or forwarded to the office. Examination is made as soon as possible of all instruments returned by field parties ; those found to be in good order are sent to the fire-proof building; those needing repairs are put in hand in the instrument shop. Early in the year Mr. Saegmuller began an examination of the limb of the dividing engine in order to form a table of corrections which could be applied in the regraduation of one of the twentyinch theodolites, and submitted plans for the construction of a new tracing and cutting apparatus intended to secure greater effectiveness and ease of arrangement. This improved apparatus was made during the year, and tests of its working proved to be exceedingly satisfactory. One of the twelve-inch theodolites was rcgraduated with a high degree of accuracy. An account of these improvements and of the tests applied is given in Appendix No. 12. Mr. John Ulark, mechanician, was occupied in constructing from designs furnished by the office, two levels of precision, intended for use on the several lines of transcontinental levelling. He took part in the experiments with the subsidiary and primary base bars; and made an apparatus to facilitate the processes of comparison of these bars with the standards. Mr. Saegmuller had the assistance of Messrs. W. Jacobi, E. Eshleman, and P. Vierbuchen, in the miscellaneous work of the instrument shop. The carpentry work of the office, eomprii:iing the woodwork of all instruments, their packing for transportation, and the repairs of office furniture, ·&c., was done by Mr. A. Yeatman, aided at different times by U. Webster, G. W. Clarvoe, and L. F. Dorn. In the office of Assistant in Charge the .clerical duties were performed by Messrs. W. B. French and W. A. IIerbert, with Mr. C. D. Gedney as stenographer during part of the year. Occasional assistance was rendered by Mr. G. A. Morrison and by l\Ir. F. H. Parsons. Expenditures for field and hydrographic operations are based on detailed estimates presented by the Assistants for consideration in advance of taking up work; so also the outlay for repairs of vessels and for outfits. Each item is carefully examined, and when approved by the Superintendent the aggregate ii:i allotted from the appropriation, for the work corresponding to the estimate.

APPENDIX

No. 6.

LETTER TO CARLILE P. PATTERSON, SUPERINTENDENT UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY, WASHINGTON, D. C., FROM ALEXANDER AGASSIZ, ON THE DREDGING OPERATIONS CARIqED ON FROM DECEMBER, 1878, TO MARCH 10, 1879, BY THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY STE.AMER BLAKE, COMMANDER J. R. BARTLETT, U.S. N. (With two maps.)

I joined the Blake at Washington, on November 27, 1878, for a second dredging cruise.. .According to your instructions we intended to proceed to Nassau, and there dernte a few days to dredging and sounding, in order to trace the connection between the fauna of the northern extremity of the Bahama Banks and that of the Straits of Florida. Owing to rough weather this was not doomed prudent, and we were compelled to put into Saint Helena Sound, and, for the same reason, when off Jupiter Inlet, instead of crossing the Gulf Stream to make ~assau, it was thought best to put in to Key West. From there, when the weather moderated, we started for Kingston, Jamaica, calling at Havana for the purpose of making a couple of hauls on the Pentacrinus ground discovered by Captain Sigsbee off Moro Light. We made two casts of the dredge in 175 to 400 fathoms, and obtained a few specimens of Pentacrinus. 1Ye kept on along the northern shore of Cuba, through the Old Bahama Channel, without stOJ)ping to sound or dredge, Mr. Pou.rtalCs having, in former years, dredged and sounded, in the Bibb, Acting Master Platt, U.S. N., over the greater part of this line. At the eastern end of the Old Bahama Channel we ran a line of dredgings and soundings across from Caya Cruz to Lobos Light. In the deepest part of the channel we found only 500 fathoms, although the hydrographic maps indicated 900 fathoms, no bott.om. This is an excellent example of the uncertainty of the old method of sounding with hemp rope, even in moderately deep water, when there is a strong current, such as we found here. Nothing of special interest came up iu any of the casts made either with the trawl or dred~e. Wound around the steel-wire rope on this line, however, we found a few pieces of the deep-sea Siphonophores (Rhizophysa), described lately by Studer in the Zeitscbrift f. wissen. Zoologie. Subsequently we frequently found more or less complew specimens of these Siphonopbores, generally entangled on the wire rope or attached to the trap of the trawl. Studer gives a long list of the depths from which they came up attached to the sounding-line, but it is by no means certain tha.t these Siphonophores belonged in the depths indieated by the wire. They may have become caught on the wire while it was reeling in at only a short distance from the surface.· The fact that Studer never succeeded in bringing up any of these species in the tow-net, even when lowered to a considerable depth, is as little conclusive, since, at any rate in the Caribbean Sea, their isolated parts and fragments a.re not uncommon floating on the surface. It is probable that tlJcy usually live at a certain depth below the surface, and some of them may, like Cassfopea, prefer to dwell near the bottom; but until we possess a net so constructed as to give some sure imlicatiou of the intermediate depths at which the animals living at various distances between the surface and bottom have been gathered in, it seems hazardous to define the bathymetrical range of a large number of pelasgic animals, such. as the A.calephs, Siphonopbores, Heteropods, Pteropods, numerous Fora.minifera, Radiolaria, and the like, the habits of which are scarcely known. In the case of fishes, when dredging in deep water at a moderate distance from the land, we ought not to take it for granted that they invariably live at the depth to which the trawl may have been lowered. The young of many of the deep-water fishes arc undoubtedly pelasgic, often
"In one caee, dredging in 1,000 fathoms, numerous fragmenta of a Rhizophysa came up after drawing in 100 fathoms of wiro ! On another occasion the ea.me species came up after drawing in 300 fathoms, while dredging in 500

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

till a late period of growth, and thus many of the deep-water fishes have probably come to light, especially in the proximity of oceanic islands, or along coa!'lts situated near deep water. We made three casts off the coast of Cuba, between Nuevitas and Cape Maysi. In latitude 210 2', N., longitude 740 44', "\V., off Cayo de l\foa, in 1,55-i fathoms, we found a patch of green sand, made up of large Globigerime, similar to that mentioned by Mr. Pourtafos in his "Deep-Sea Corals." ·we also obtained, in 094 fathoms off Nuevitas, large blocks of genuine white chalk, composed mainly of Globigerinm and lfotulinm. Large quantities of ooze and white clay, which proved to be only the white chalk in different stages of compression, also came up in the trawl. If the conditions now existing at that depth at all resemble those of the time of the white chalk, I couhl readily understand how perfectly Sea-Urchins or l\follmiks would be preserved if once inclosed in this homogeneous substance, to be gradually compressed into solid white chalk. In one of the hauls taken between Cape 1\IaJ·si and Jamaica (1,200 fathoms), we obtained the til'st $pecimens of Phorn10soma I had seen alive. I was much astonished to find themr folly blown up, hemispherical or globular in shape. This was the shape they always took in subsequent hauls, and on several occasionR, when they were obtained from comparatively shallow water, near the 100-fathom line, tliey came up fully alive and retained their globular out.line. The alcoholic specimens I had seen in the Cliallenger collections came up as flat as pocket-handkerchiefs, from great tlepths, and were naturally regarded as fiat Sea-Urchins, although of course endowed with great mobility of test. These Echini, with their globular, flexible tests, recall vividly the Perischoechinill:e, with which they have also points of resemblance of great interest in the structure of their amlmlacral and interambulacral plates. In the dredgiugs taken off the southeastern end of Jamaica we did not bring up anything of great importance. From Jamaica we were obliged, owing to the strong trades, to keep on toward St. Thomal:l, without either sounding or trawling till off Porto liico. During the winter months the trades blow sufficiently hard to make dredging and soun<liug quite uncomfortable on a vessel of the size of the Blake. We had, therefore, no opportunity of adding anything to the hydrography of that part of the Caribbean Sea. Ou arriving at St. Thomas we made a 11rogmmme for our season's work. This we were fortunate enough to carry out to the letter, as far as the dredging and sounding were concerned. With the exception of the time required for coaling and overhauling the engine at Martinique and St. farnia, not a single day was lost. Although Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee, U.S. N., did not comnutnd the Blake, yet the improvements which were made this year in the dredging and sounding apparatus were all carried ont under his supervision, the vessel having been fitted out for sea before he was relieved by Commander J. R. Bartlett, U. S. N., who commanded the Blake during this winter. It was also my good fortune to find on board the majority of the officers with whom I l:lailetl in the wint~r of 1877-'78; Lieutenant Sharrer, the executive officer, Messrs. Jacobi, Peters, L. P. Sigshee, and lk Nourse. Now, as before, I was indebted to their cordial interest and efficient assistance, as well as to that of' Lieuteuant Wallis, Mr. Pemberton, and Mr. E. L. Reynolds, who had joined the Blake for the first time. We thus started under the very best auspices. In the use of the improved machinery, suggested by our former cruise, the experience of the old officers sarn<l us from the annoyances which always accompany the introduction of new methods. The Blake was this year provhled with a new double-cylinder reelillg-engine, built l>y Copeland & Ifacou, phwed at right angles to the reel, on which our steel rope was wound. A small double engine revolved the reel, so that the wire rope was wound independently of the main roolingcngine. The wire rope was led to the }}Ort side directly from the main reeliug-engine, then by a farge wronght-irnu sheave along the deck to the mainmast, thence across to the starboard. side, and then along the deck to the 1·eel upon which it was wound. This worked admirably, relieving the reel, which thus became a mere spool, from all strain either in winding up or in dredging, the whole stmin being taken up by the t(!n turns of the wire rope on the surging drum of the main reeling-engine. The arra.i1gemeuts for leading off the wire from the bow of the ship, through a large sheave at the end of tlle dredging-broom, were practically the same as last year. '.the steelspring accuurnlator was, however, replaced this year by one of car-rubber springs, suspended along the foremast, a.ud to this acc11mula.tor was attached the pendant running along the dredging-boom which carried the dredging-pulley.

of the Reports of tlrn Coast and Oemlctic Snrn>J'· a full account of the dredgfog- aml sonrnliug· apparatuR 1rned on hoard th<> Blake, I will not fipeak in g-mater detail of onr apparatus. No change waR ma<lf· in onr dre<lg-es. Iu tht> trawls SP''t>ral 1ww formR Wf'rC triC'd, hnt W<' found that the most, satisfactory trawl waR of the shape :\(lopted last ~·<'ar, th<' only important clJange being- the gTeater height of t,he runncrs-:m inche8. 'l'he bar eounecting- the runners was used as a frame to stret,ch a sheet of netting acrosR the whole h<'am, so ns to <lh·ide the trawl opening into two hal ms, eaeh opening into the trap. '!'his enabled UR to giye a longer h'n1l liJw to the mouth of the double trawl, without danger of fouling from tl1c lt>atl line of the other Rid<'. The only clrnnge I could still suggest would be that thiR lead line :should nm through ring-s at thP corners of the runners; the Rtrai11 on tlw Ride which fell on the grournl wonl«l takt' up the slack of the n11per side, and thus increase still further the i'IWCt~p of the trawl. Onr trawl-nets were madP much shorter than last year; and for deep work, when so much oozp is alwa;n: likely to choke tlw trawl, it would he advisable for a 10-foot lwam to Lan~ a net of not rnort' than 1~ t() 1:1 feet in length. \Ye also tried dragging a hea'Y tow-net rapid!~· over the> ground at great depths in hopel'< of catching the more active crustacea aml fishes; but we fournl tliat, after all, 110 deep-sea macliine worked better than a trawl, which, when u10ved rapitlly o\·cr tlir ground, at the rate sonwtimes of two to two and a half miles per hour, inYariably hroug-lit up a tinr hanest of Fisl1es and Crnstaeen, in addition to the usual contents of the sedentary and more sluggish forms. Al though th(· 1le<>p8ea tow-net was used seYeral times, we never brong-ht np any of tlw Ro-called <lerp-st>a Siphonophora> of Studer, even in localities where t11ey came up on tlw wire rope. Captain Sigsbee's new sounding-rnaehine worked admirably, and hf· has <·n·ry rrasm1 to lw entirely satisfied with the improvementR he lias made upon his former machine. \Ve carried 6,000 fathom8 of new, g-ah'anized steel -wire rope, 1,16 inchC'R circumference, ma1lc liy the Roebling Sons' Company, which, O\Ying· to itR gre:it<:'r pliabilit,\, prm·ecl eren more o;afo~factory than the wire rope userl on the last cruise. The Rteel-wire ro)le contiuuetl during- onr whole cruii<<' to giYe complete satisfaction, antl m1ahlerl nR, as in tile preYiOU8 year, to work with the greatest possible rapidity consistent with safety and with the proper handli11g of the tra.wh; arnl drctlg·cs. \Ye usually lowered in deep water at tile rate of four to fonr and a half or Jh·e minutes per 100 fathoms, and reeled in at the same rate. In the many place:< where \W found rough or rocky bottom we used a flat bar of 6-foot beam, to which rings were atta<"hed for fastening tangles :11111 a shot. This bar, with from a dozen to fifteen hundles of tauglcR, proyed perhaps our most effl·et in~ machine in rough bottoms. It rarely fouled, as the <lredge8 or trawls arc so apt to do, wh<>n working oYer unfa,·orable ground. The region oYer which we chiefl~· worked this year extm1detl from St. Thomas to Trinidad. Over a limited area like thi8 it was post<iihlc to coyer the grourn1 very satisfactorily. The work done off the priI1ftpal islands hegan usuan~~ at the 100-fathom li1w, and extended into the deepest water off the lee side of the Carihbea,n Islands. l{ut little conld h0 done in the way of dredging in the passages betwl>en the islarnls or to the windward of th1·111, owing t-0 the strong trades. \Vhile working off Barbaqoes wt' untlouhtrdly ohtaiiwd a fair r<>prPsentation of the fauna to the windward of the Caribbean Islands, which dot>s not RPem t.o diffrr from that of the lee side. During this season we occupied no less than 200 1;:tation.1:;, and made owr 230 hanls from the 100-fathom line to the depth of 2,412 fathoms. A few hauls wPre occriRionall-'- matle in slrnllow water, but they formed no part of our.regular scheme. Although we ha Ye obtainetl from tlw "\\'c~t India Islands some of the most interesting InvertebrateR, yet WP did not tlml thP fomia of t Ii(' eastern extremity of the Caribbean Sea materially different from that of the Gnlf of :'.\Iexico a111l the Straits of Florida. It certainly is hy no mcaus as rich in animal life at great, depths.

I was greatly struck with the largP nnrn her of onr Rpecies which, if not identical, are at. least closely alli£>1l to those bronght liorne by the Challenger; and I was specially disappointed at the absence of tnwoS not alrea<l;y collected ll,r tlrn great l~ng-lish expedition. I thiuk it cau be fairl;r stated that tht> great outlines of the 11eep-8ea fanna are now known, and tllat, although many interesting forms will nnilon btedl,r he 1lrcdged i11 the shallower waters, between 100 a11d 300 fathoru;;, we can hardly expect to add matPrially to tlie types discowre1l by tlw dredging expeditions of the htst ten ;rears. As has heen well said hy J\Ir. Mosek>y, of the Challenger, it becomes somewhat . monotonous to find constantly the sanw associations of lnYcrtclirates in tlt(' deeper l1auls, and it is only iu shallower waters that it is possible to keep up one\; cntlrnsiasm ttfter a few months' work. l 8IJOnld !Jr inclined, from thr experience or the past two years, to carr)~ the range of the dee1l·sea fauna as high as 300 or 350 fatliomH, and to call tlte littoral fauna the species extending mainly to the 100 or mo fatho111 line ; from the 100 to the 300 or 400 fathom Jiue extend the species which are neither littoral nor ;ret han the wide gt\ogra11ltical range belonging to species found beyond tllat 11epth. Bnt this upper limit of the del'p-sea fauna must, of course, dcpe1Hl npon thP temperaturt·, and undonbtedl~- varies greatly from local or partly local calrne8. " 7 hile dredging to tile leeward of the Uarihbean Islands we could not fail to notice the large accnnmlations of Yegetahle nm tter and of land dehri8 brought up from de(lp water many miles from the shore. It was not an nncommon thing to find at a depth of OYer 1,000 fathoms, ten or fifteeu 111ilt·i; from htll(l, masses of leaves, piece8 of bamboo, of sugar-cane, dead land-sllells, and other land debris~ which are nrnloubtedly all hlow11 out to sea hy the prentiling caRterly trade-winds. \Ye frerpwnt1y fomul floating 011 the :·mrfaee masses of vegetati1m, more or le1'S water-logge1l a111I read;r to sink. The contents of some of our trawls would certainly han~ 1mzzll.'d a paln·ontologist; bet ween tlw deep-watPr forms of Crustacea, A nnelidR, Fishes, Echinofierms, Sponges, &c., and the mango and orange lean'8 mingle1l with branches of ham hoo, uutmegR, laud shells, both animal and vegetable fonns bei11g in stwh profm;ion, he would lt::ive found it difficult to decide whether he bad to deal with a marine or a land fauna. Sneh a lwul from some fossil deposit would naturally be explained as representi11g a shallow estuary surrounded by forest8, and yet the depth might ham been 1,i'JOO fathoms. Thi" large amount, of vegetable maMer thm; carried out to sea, seemR to l1ave a matPrial Pfi'cct in increaRing, in certain localit,ies, tl11· number of mariue forms. 'l'he collectiou:-. made have all arrirn!l in Uarnbri1lge, a11d will he sent for determination, as fast i1s practicable, to the naturalists "-110 ham undertaken the reports OIL the different groups of last year"s eolleetions. As their 1m)limi11ary n·port8 are well m11for w-ay, I need only allude here in genflral to some of the most iuteresting types. Among tlle l<'oraminifora are a number of the arenaceonr< t;vpes noticed hy JI.Ir. Brady in the collrn~tim1g of the Challenger aml Porcnpiue; among the SpougeH, a RJWcies alli(·d to l'hno11ema, a small Hyalonenm, tufts of large, silicious spicules (Hyal01w111a proper), covered at one eIHl with Zoantlnrn yer,Y similar to the common ,Japanese type; fine Rerics of Dad.ylocalyx, showi11g Uw whole mode of growth from a simple globular form, and a gigantic Euplectdla. The collt>ctio11 of HtarJislwis was quite ismall, and contaiued nothing worthy of Rpecial noticP. The collectio11 of' llolothnriam; contained, i11 addition to the deep-sea forms mentioned ia my former 11-;tten;, a larger nnmher of s1)eciel'1 than last yea.r-genera allied to l\folpadia, Caudina, Echino1·tteumis, aml the like. Among· th<> Echini, with the excPption of tl1e PonrtalC'sia group, all the types collecte1l by tl1e Challenger are well l'PJ·resc1nt<>il, with a fpw SpatangoitlR, hitl1erto unknown~ The number of Echiuothnriw mm quite larg·c. Of the l'ourtalesia group, but few specimens in good condition were ohtaiued, thougl1 the trawl bronglit np numerous fragments of several of the geuem (if I am not rnista"ken) collected by the Challenger in (leep water in the Southern Oce.'tn. The sma.11 1rn111her of Clnw:tHtroid;; colkcteAl, \'\·en when apprnacl1ing the South American shore, at the 100-fathom line, near 'frini<lad, wllere they are so common, shows pretty conclusively that tlle group, with the ('XC<>ptio11 of l~chinoc~·anms, is an eminently littoral one. A large colleetion of Comatulre was made, and a uumher of specimens of Hhizocrinus were obtai1wd, but only a few were in perfect 11ondition. Of lfolopns 0111.v a 11art of a specimen was found.

straug·e associations with Corals, Gorgoni:P, Spo11ges, and even Mollusks. A species of Phorus was frequently accompanied by a large A m1e.lid, comfortably established in the axis of the shell, with the head clm;e to the aperture. Among the Crustacea "·e fouud agaiu the Bathyoiwmns gigautcus A. 1\L Edw., discoYered bst year. ,,~e ahlo brought up from 734 fathom::; a l'ygnogouium, measuring not ll.'ss than two fol.'t along the legs when full~- extended; :i tine .1stw.·us zaleucus, an<l from 41G fathoms a magnificent species, allied to ::"ephrops, hlind, but with rmlimentary e~-c-8talks. Au interesting Isopod, with g-igantic lateral processes on the posterior spg·meut, was also oLtaiued from 300 fathoms. Ma11y Hermit-crabs oecupietl tulles uf lla1111100 or cavities iu dead wood and Spo11ges, of which they completely close<l tlw orifice, witlt one of the large claws tlatte11ed like the opcrenluru of a Serpnla.

I hope to supply Jnr. Hall with the material 1wccssar.\· for au auatorn_y of this iutcrcstii1g genus. But h,y far the mo:;t interestiug of the l\lollusks is a t\pirnla, from a 11epth of !JJO fathoms, in excellent condition. The small nnw lier of \Vald. lieimia collected this .rear is 11uitc striki11g. Other species of Tereora.tula: were more common. '\Ve fouud, as was usual last year, an immense number of dead l'teropod shells at all depths, playing a most importaut part i11 determining the nature of the deep-sea llottom. The collection of .Fishes is excellent; its S]Jecial characteristic is tlle large number of Lopllioitl types it contains. 'Ve also obtained rnan;v of tile genera collected by the Challenger. Some of the ran~r pclasgic :Fishes, whiclt are occasionally caught at sea, are undoubtedly either full grown deep8ea Fi1::1ltes or their ~-oung. It becomes an iutere:;;ting· problem to know where the young remain, before they become permanently inlutbitants of deep water. The pelasgic fauna of the eastern part of the Caribbean Sea is, during the winter sea~mn, rather scanty. Owing to the constaut agitation of tbe water, I bad no opportunity, as in the Gulf, to make mnch use of tlrn imrface tow-net. 1''rom the 1mmber of fragments of Siphouophora· coustantly fouud tlwy must be YcQ' numerous. Iu the roadstea1l, nuder tbe lee of the islands, there was but little pela:;;gic life to lie found. E''erythiug eitlter remains at a short distance below the surface, or is blown ont to seawanl of the island8. Tim phol"JJhorcscmrne, in conscqnence, is far less brilliant than iu the Gulf of l\lexico, although occasioually the nrnsses of Ctenophorrn (a species of ~Inemi. opAiti ), swiuuning at, different depths, produced a YPry striking illumination; sudden flashes of light 1m1ldenl,y appearing as if corning from great halls of fire floating a sl10rt distance below the snrfaet~. The most strikiug· phosphorc;-;ceut phenomena were produced by a small .Amielid allied to Syllis, which rnowd oyer the surface of the water with great rapidity, performing the most nmrnrlrnllle gyratious, aml tracing its path, wliieh n:maiued phosphorescent for a sl10rt time, lly a hrillim1t line of light. Among the llcep-water fomu; 8eYeral of tlrn species of Gorgouire antl Antipathes (espeeially Hiiima) shmn~d a bright Lluish phosphoresce.nee when comiug up in the trawl. One Ophinran, also, like oue of the J\Iediterranean species mentioned by Panceri, was exceedingly phosphorescent, emitting along the whole length of its anus at the joints a brilliant, bluish-green light. 01w of the mo;,:t interesting results rcaehed l·y this year's cruise is the light thrown upon the former extension of the South .American eoutiuent by the SOUll!liugs taken while dredging, and those suhscqncntly made in the passages between the islands by Commander Bartlett. These, together with the soumli11gs already kuowu, cualllc us to trace the outline of the old continent with tolerable accuracy, antl tlm8 obtain some intelligible, and at the same time trustworthy, explanation of tl1e 11eculiar geographical di,;trilmtion of tl1e fauna and fiora of tbe West India Islands. As is well known, Calla, the Bahamas, Ha,\·ti, an<l Porto l{,ico, instead of showing, as we might natural!,\· assume from their present proximity to l<'lorida, a decitlcd aflinity in their fauna and flora with that, of the Southern United States, show, 011 the contrary, unmistakable assooiation with that of l\lexico, Honduras, and Centml America; the Caribbean Islands show in part the same relationship, though the affinity to the Venezuelan and Brazilian fauna and flora is much more marked.

things existing iu a former 1>eriod, we are at once :,;truck by the fact that the Virgin Islands are the outcropping of an exten:-;ive bank. The greatest depth hetwee11 thei,;e ii>lawfa is less t11an 40 fathoms, this same dept11 being found on the !Jank to the east of Porto Hieo, the 100.fatlwm li11P forrni11g, in fact, the outline of a large iHla)l(l, which woultl i11clwle the wl1olc of tht· \'irgiu fola111l><, the whole of Porto Rico, arnl exteml some wa,r iuto tlrn :Moua Pm;H:tg'!'.

It formH au elougatcd plateau, extending- from Hcqnia to thl' Hontllwe,;t of Crenada, and runs more or less parallel to tlie South Alllericau coa1->t from tl11· ::\[argarita l;;lamls, lt>a\·i11g <t comparatively narrow channel betwel'u it autl the 100-fathom line i-;onth of Gn~n:Hla, ,;o aH to iuduse Trinidad anll Tobago within its limits, and runs off to tlic soutllC'a,;t iu a direction a!Ho about parallel to the shore line. At tlie wcstem eml of tlie Caribbean Sea the 100-fathom 1i11e forms a gigantic bank otf the 1\Iosquito coast, cxteudiug oyer one-third the distance from the maiularnl to the island of Jamaica. The Rosalind and Pedro Banks, formed by the Haine line, and a few oth0r smaller banks, denote the position of more or less important islamh; which must !taYe once existed between the Mosquito coast and ,Jamaica. On examining the 500-fathom line we thus iiull thM Jamaica is only the northern l'lpit. of a gigantic promontor;r, which once extended toward Hayti from tlic mai11larnl, reaching from Costa Hica to the nort,bern part of the l\foRqnito coa:st, and lea-riJJg but a cornparntin~l.>· 11arrow passagP between it aml tlie 500-fathom line encircliug Hayti, Porto Rico, aud the Yirgin lshlnd1', in one i,:·igantic island. The pas:sag-e between Cuba aml .Jamai«a has a ([(>pth of 3,000 fatlwms, aml tliat between Hayti and CulJa i:s uot less than 87::; fatliorns, the latter bei11g' prol>a1J1y au arm of the .Atlantic. The 500-fathom line co11nects, as a g-igantic islaml, tltP bauk8 u11iting Anguilla to Ht. Bartholomew, Saba Bank, tlie one co1111ecting St. Eustatius to Nc,·is, lfarlm<la to Antigua, aml from thence extends soutli so as to iudude Guadeloupe, J\1arie-Galantt>, awl J)omiuica. 'l'!Jis :;oofatbom line thus forms one giga.ntic island of tlie northern islands, extending from S;tlm Bank to Santa Cruz, aml leaving lJnt a narrow charmcl between it aml the eastern end of the 500-fat hom line nmniug around Sauta Cruz. As Santa Umz is separated from St. Tlloma8 by a channel of forty miles, with a maximum depth of oYer ~,400 fathom:s, this plainly shows itt"> eonneetiou with the northern islands of the Caril.Jl.Jeau group rather titan with St. Thoma!', as is afao well "hown h,v the geographical relations of its l\follusca. 'I'he ;)00-fatlwm line again uuites in oue gigantic spit, extending nortlterly from tlrn month of the Orinoco, all the islandi;; to the 8outh of 1\Iartini·iuc, leaving Barbadoes to the cast, and a narrow passage between ::\lartinique and the islands of Dominica and St. Lucia. At the time of this l'ouuectiou, therefore, the Caribb<'an Sei1 co11neete1l with the Atlantic only by a narrow passage of a few miles in "·idth between St. Lucia aud .Martinique, and one somewhat wider and sliglttI.r deeper between l\Iartiui(fllC allll Dominica, auot.lwr hetweeu Sombrero aud the Virgin lslauds, antl a coruparati,-el.r narrow passsage between .Jawaiea and Hayti. The Caribbean Sea, therefore, must have h1xm a gulf of the Pacific, or lt:n-e f'ounected with it through wide passages, of wliich we tin<l the traces in the Tertiary amI Cretaceoui-; deposits of tlie Isthmus of Darien, of Panama, and of Nicaragua. <'entral America and nortlH'ru Sonth America ftt that time must .have been a scrit'S of large islands with iiassages between tltem from the Pacific into the Caribbean. It is furtlier interesting to speculate what mnist haYe become of tlle great equatorial current, or rather of the current produced h,r the northeast tmdcs. The water hanking up against the two large i:slamls then forrniug the CarilJbean Islauds must, of course, han· been deflected north, haYe swept round tlic noLthern shores of the Yirgi11 Island, Porto Hko, a111l H1yti, and poured into the western basin of the Caribbean Sea through tlle passagt' hetwe1m Hayti and Cuba. This water being forced into a sort of funnel by the ;iOO-fatholll liue formiug the south em line of the Great Bahama Island, which connected nearly the whole of the Bahamas with Cuba, and formed a barrier to the western tlow of the equatorial enrrent, this must, tliereforn, for tl1e greater part, ha,·e been detlectc<l north, awl. either 8\nipt in a nm·tlwasterl,r directiou, as tlie Gulf Stream now does, or round the north eutl of the Haha1mt8, acro>iH Florida, wliid1 did not then exist, across the Gulf of Mexico, and iuto the Pacific oYer the I:sthmu:s of 'l'ehuantepec.

''I counected the islands lJy rn11uiug trn\erses across the ridges. From St. Yincent to St. J,ucia. the ridge was only from 150 to 170 fathoms IJelow the surface, with a channel of 400 fathoms near St. Vincent. The channel hctweeu St. Lucht and Martinique had 500 fathoms in mill-channel, slopiug upwanl fo each islaml. The diannd between 1\lartinique aud Dominica was a. tough one, and I thought I ishoultl nernr find a ridge. 'l'he sonndiugs increased regularly on a rillge to 300 fathoms in mid-clrnnnel, where l got a ::;onuding of 883 fathoms, and then 1,000 fathoms; beyond this the ridge was some ten miles tu the westward, witli an average depth of 400 fathoms, but I foullll two peaks with only 40 fathoms. The deep water from the (.);iribbean Sea makes in between (}n:ulelonpe mul :Montserrat, but 1 found a ridge of about 300 fa.thmm; connecting Antigua with Gna<leloupe. In this channel I also fouml a pea,k with only 40 fathoms. I finished up the line connecting Saba Bank with St. Croix. l found the connection perfect, but the ridge has 700 fathoms of water 011 it near St. Croix. There is 1,000 fathoms three miles north, and 1,800 fathoms tiYe miles ;;outh of the ridge. I mu a line from Uog Island to vVhite House Shoal, and back to Sornhreru. lfrre l found a clrnmid about ten miles wide, with 1,100 fathoms.

The soumling::i 11uHle hy Commander Bartlett, after I left the Bhtke, to determine the ritlges uuiting the ntrious isht1Hh between Sombrero and Trinidad, show plainly that the cokl water of tlw Carilil1eall ean only come iu tllrough the pa;;sage between Soml>rero aud the Vil-gin lslamls, which i;; aboHt 1,100 fatl10111::1, with a bottom temperature of 38°, while the liOO-fathom line, as I 11m·e 8:thl, fom1s a gigantic bland of all the i;;lands to the ;;onth of Sombrero, including Dominica, with a uanow passage of 1,000 fatl10111s betweeu it aml llfartinique; the 500-fathom line again u11iti11g i11to onP large spit, as a imrt of South America, all tlie h;lamh; to the soutll of it.

A,.;,.;JST.\XT

In the geographical reconnaissances hy tl!e Coast and Geodetic Stir\·ry on the I 1 acific Coast for the determination of tlte latitudes of numrrous points rtnd their differences of longitude from well-established stations, accuracy of results and rapidity of manipulation were cspeci;1ll,v d(·mandcd. The instruments first use1l in s1wh work were the :.!(;-inch 'Yiirdc111a1111 JlOrtable transit aud th1· 45-inch zenith telescope, witl1 a singh· ohsern~r, and only one night for ohserrntio11 at each statiou, frequently landing through the snrf at enming and returning to the Yessel before morning. For the support of the in;,truments a woode11 block was :mnk 21 feet in the gronnrl, all(l stood'..!~ fPi:t abon> the 1mrfacc, and a small portable wooden obsernttory wai;; used for protPdio11. ThesP rpquired about twenty minutes' lal>or to he in readiness for tlH' instrurnen ts. 'l'hp transit was plac<'d in the meridian, and ohserYations for inRtrnmental and clock emrection;;; ntrt<le therewitli. The transit was then replaced by the zenith telei;cope for latitude ohservatious, whielt p;enerally l'Ht· braced twelrn pairs of stars. In 1853 this special dnty led me to make the proposition to seem'<' a fine lenl to one of t!JP finders of tl1e transit, and to ad<l a micrometer with Yertical mon·nH~nt of tht> horizontal thn·ad, so that after the completio11 of the transit ob.~errations the same instrument wonld lw at ow·e aYailable for the latitude obsn>ations by the zenith telescope rnetl101l. This ill\"Oln·d the liftiug of the telescope from its bearings after the ohsen-atiou upon the first star, and rPrersing tlw trau;;;it. axis and directing the telescope to the same zenith distance on the oppo;,itc sid!' of tlw ;wnith for the second star. In January, 1858, drawings of such an instrument, with prismatic teleseopc, &c., wPn· 1rn11k for the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, and are on file in the arc11h·cs. In my geographical reconnaissance along the coast of Alaska in 18Gi, the peculiarities of tht' climate especially demonstrate{! that rapidity of adjtistment. and of ohsenatiou \Yerc p;.;;scntial to success, and a study of the problem le<l me to th<> present improYed form of instrument, wh!'n1h:.· the zenith telescope as an independent instrument is abandoned, because tlw ue.w nwrillian inRtr11ment. combines all the essentials of the transit and zenith instrnmPnts, and afforlls 11w:111s for 1liP accurate determination of the instrumental and clock corrections, for the tletC'rmiuation of' tlw latitude by meridional zenitJ1 distances, aud for the determination of the astronnmieal aziurntli of a given mark by observations upon a close circumpolar star at a,uy hour angle. The main idea in this new form is that the cast-iron horizontal frame of the transit stand i~ divided into two parts horizontally, and that tlic upper part, for carrying the supports of till' transit axis, moves on the lower part hy means of a short hut large central vertical axis; t11nt 1111' lower frame carries the foot screws; that the two frames can be very firmly cl:unpe1l togpthl'r directly over each other, or when making a moderat~ly s111aH angle with eacl1 otlwr (I.i 0 or :!0°); and that the ends of tl1e frames a.rt· parts of the same eircle, with gradnatious 011 Jl11· l1mff awl a vernier on the upper frame. The short vertical axis would, per se, afford doubtful stability, hut the bem·i11gR of tlt(· circular ends of the two frames are ground to each other where they come into contact, and, therefore, in latitude observations, the upper frame bears upon the lower as when they are clamped for trat1sit

work.

The size of each frame is 11~ inches broad, with an extreme lcngUt of 21t inches,:the emh; being arcs of a circle of tha.t dimurter. ~'he firRt advantage of a donhlc fmmr is tlw greater rapidity with which the instrnment can he adjusted in the plane of t.hc meridian, or int.he plane of the Yertical of a close circumpolar star; for, wlieu once leYcllcd, 110 dmngc of position of the lower frame is rr.qnired, and repeated leYellings after each approximation an· aYohled. 'rhc telescope carried hy the upper frame is mo>ed smoothly and uniformly in searching for the star. This monm1cnt of the upper frame is effected hy mea.nR of a horizontal tangential screw at.tached to the lo"Wer frame, and which can be thrown into gear with a depressell scr(~W cnt in a brass plate upou the external cireular end of the upper frame. "'hen the star is found it is followed with the tangent screw until within reach of the finer azimuth screw·. The two frames are> tl1en strongly clam1wd together h:y fonr large capstan-headed steel :;crews, which pass throngh slots near the four angles of the upper frame; and screw into tlle lower frame. Then the fmal tHljnstment for the meridian is made with the azimuth sere"'.', after a prt·cautionary re-examination of the lwrizontality of the transit axis le,·el. Another auu ver_y decided adrnntagt' in the mm of the double frame is in placing the instrument in or ver,y close to the plane of tlw meridian by obscrYationii ou rolaris, cnm in daylight and when away from the meridian. Knowing approximatcl;r or closely, as tlw casl' 11my he, the hour angle of the star, and computing its zenith distance and azimuth," the telescope is pointell to the require1l altitude, and moved by 1he. tangent screw in {tzimut.h until tlle star is <letecte<l. '.l'be azimuth of the star at that hour nngle is then laid off by the arc graduation on either end of tbe frame, and the frameR clamped. The telescope is then in the plane of the meridiau, arnl transit ohsern1tions ma.r be commenced. After the transit ohserTations are furnishPtl, the stops are adjusted upon tl1e lower frame, hy "'liich the position of the meridian is readil,y found; the four clamping screws arc relieved, and thc nppcr frame is frpe to u10Ye on the lower, antl ohscryations for latitude are at once commenced an<l are made in lH'ecisely the 8amc manner as with the zenith telescope. If transit observations nre again needrnl, the upper frame is simply clampctl at the stops. '\Yi th teleseo1ws of eqnal power tliis uew form has advantages ornr the best form of the zenith t(·lcf::cope in the stability of the support.s and the longer transit axis of tbe telescope. For astronomical azimut11s at the main stations of the triang,nlation, tbe instrument affords sonie Lkcided adYantag-l'S in lieing clamprnl near the vertical of a close circumpolar star at any l1onr angle, and tlrns allowing measurementR to be made between the Rtar and the, azimuth mark or collimator with tl1e ocular micrometer. · The latest arrangement of the instrument haR thr<'c finder circlcs. The larger one, reading to 10", is furnishe1l with a delicate chambcn\<l le.\'Cl for the latitude observations, and is placed on the teleHcope tnbe hetwcen the tra.nHit axis and the ol~jectiYe; the two small finders arc of four inches in <lianwter, f'nmii-;l1ell with small anll Jlroportionately delicate levels, and read to one minnte of are. 'l'he telescope also earrif's a fi1w ocular micrometer, capable of rca<ly adjustment in the vertical and liori:r.ontal pl:uwR. ~Wl1e11 tl1e micrometer iR horizontal and cfamped, transit threads ,·ertical, n minute steel stop·Rcrew abnti-; against a small sttwl stop to recover the position after the clamping has been free<l and the micrometer used in the vertical. \Vhe11 the micrometer is in the horizontal position, there arc uine vertical transit threads at equatorial intcrvalF; of 10 seconds for the transit ohsenations, and also the micrometer thrcat1, wl1ich is parallel with the middle transit thread. Thr a<ljnstment of the system is made in the mmal manner. '\Vhen tlie micrometer is turned 90° for latitude ofiservations, the horizontality of the micrometer thread is a11jnsted 11y means of a collimator, hy a slow moving star, or by a sharply defined terreRtrial ol~ject..

In order to measure the incli11ation of the tranF:it axis in transit observations when tl1e trle· scope is })Ointing t-0 or near the zenith, where the ordina.ry F1tri(ling level is nmwailahle, a hanging level was devised for that purpose; hut in practice the striding le"rnl is preferred, and the form of the transit axis pivots is accurately determined hy lcvPlliug with the telescope remoYed from the transit axis. To prevent unequal expansion of the transit axis ph·ots by tlie heat from the mumination Jamp both pfrots are made hollow, and a lamp used at each ext.remit~·, while a YN'.Y small reflect-Or is inserted at the intersect.ion of the lines of tlie trausit and optical axis. To prevent irregular cutting of the pivots from grains of 8and, &c., the V's an' facf'd with plates of agaro having a curn)d surface of large radius. One of the Vs for the transit axis pivots has a horizontal moYement hy means of a large but fine micrometer screw; hut in order that no unknown mo»ement sha.ll take place in this V during observations, a horizontal slot has been cut iit the body of the V parallel with the transit axis, and a clamping screw passerl through tlle outer brass guide-plate, tluongl1 this slot, and into tl1e inner brass guide-plate. When the Vis in tht· desirell position this clamping screw is tightened, and the V becomeR as Recure as the pillar itself. The second V for the transit axis pivots has a nwtical movement by means of a large finP screw and two heavy steel guide-pins, &c. Having satisfied m:vself that this was equally objectionable with the olcler forms of the azimuth V, e\·en when Ride guide-pieces were also added, a Yertical slot has been cut in the body of the V parallel with flif' transit axis, aml a clamping screw passed through the outer brass guide-plate wl1ich I had Mlded, through the slot and into the inner brass guide-plate, which I had also added. Vvhen t11e V iH in the desired position this clamping screw is tightened, and the V becomes as secure as the pillar itself. In the work of geographic,11 reconnaiRsanee, and also in tl1e geodetic work in tlie great mount. ain chains of the United States, the question of size, weight, and portabilit,r of the instruments in nse is a ver,r important one, and therefore I ha,·e uot introduced reversing apparatus to the instrument. But to prmrent the wearil1g of the pivots of the transit axis by pressure upon tlie V's and by the weight of the lm·el, graduated springs can readily be secured to the uprig·hts or pillars carrying the V's, and press upward on the under side of the transit axis near the pivots, or on the under side of that part of the pivot which pr~jects he.vond the V's. To th~ inverted V's of the heavy striding level of United States Coast Survey transit No. 3 I have adapted an analogous arrangement whereby most of the weight of the level is borne on the upper surfaces of the V botliPs. In order to make the instrument practically available for the douhle duty of transit and lat.itnde obsen·ations, the telescope must be able to show stars of the seYenth magnitude with fair illumination, and to bear a power of at least 100. It had been found that the portable transit" of 26 inches focal length would fairly show stars of the sixth ma.gnitude and stand a power of 6.J. The Troughton and Simms zenith telescopes of 45 inches focal length aml 2i inches aperture sometimes failed to show stars of the seventh magnitude, and certainly were unavailable for smaller stars. When the first instrument of the new form was projected it was decided to try a telesco}Je of 30 to 32 inches focal length, and to properly proportion the cast-iron stand thereto. The telescope of the new instrument, ha.'1 a. focal length of 31! inches, witl1 an ol~ject glass of 2~ inches tliameh~r, and gives good definition with a power of 100; the length between bearing points of pivots llei11g· 17~ inches, and the height of the transit axis 17t inches above the horizontal frame. In experimenting with the instrument for stability when three foot-screws were used I fonnrl that horizontal strains upon the Yertical support over the single foot-screw had fa,r greater <'1fect in the derangement of its adjustments than with similar strains upon the support over the two footscrews. The third foot-screw was abandoned, and two foot-screws added at that end and placed similarly to the two at the other end. Of course this involved the Jlracticability of leveling the instrument so that equal bearing should be borne by each of the four foot-screws. This was soo11 found t.o be practicable and very satisfactory. The tests consisted in placing the instrument in adjustment, with the striding level on transit axis, latitude level set, and teleseo}le.collimat.ell; t~1eu eqno.I strains were made upon the supports by spring llalance. The test can reathly he made with· out the spring balance. But another decided advantage is obtained with the four foot-screws in

January 31, at 2h 50m p. m., turned instrument off meridian and found Polaris; transit axis Yer,y nearly level; then from the altitude and azimuth table of Polaris,+ with the approximate time, determined the azimuth of the star; mo\·ed the upper frame through the required angle and clamped the frames; telescope is now in the meridian, or sufficiently near so for obserYations, \rhieh may he commenced at sunset for the smaller stars, or earlier for the larger ones. In this case a discussion of part of the transit observations sh0wed that the instrument poi11tetl l."1!) west of north. The stops were adjusted to the lower frame in order to be ready for the latitude obserYations. A single st,ud stands out one-eighth of an inch from one end of the upper frame, and care must be taken in a<1justing the stop on eacll eud of the lower frame, so that wl1e11 the tdescope is pointing eit.lier south or north the stud is a.gainst that side of the stop, by which either star may be followed iu azimuth off the meridian if necessary by moYing the upper frame. For latitude ol>smTations after the transit work is finished, the four heaYy stTC\YS chimpi11g the two frames are re!lloved. The clamp securing the micrometer tulle, when tlle set-screw is up to its stop, is loosened, the micrometer turned 900 until the stop comes to the second sct-scl'ew, and tlw clamp tightened; the graduated head of the micrometer is down war<l, and the instrument is I'l'lH lr for work. I fiud that it is pi'eferable to set the mean of the zenith distances of the gh-eu pair of stars by one of the small finder circles, clamp the telescope to the re·1 nircd altitude, and then mo\·e the latitude circle until the lcn1l thereof is ceutral. This amids handling the more delicate cil'eh· and its attachmeuts, and keeps the level free from the near approach of the reading lamp or candle. To indicate how rapidly the change may be made from the transit obserrntious to the lntitmle observations I give an example from the experiment record . .A complete list of transit stars was selected to determine all the instrumental errors and the clock correction. The list emled with the close circumpolar Radcliffe 1311, of the G~ magnitude I was my own recorder, and had no assistance whatever. 1 had made out a la.titude list of tweh-e pairs, of which the first pair was Rad. 1311 north aml B. A. 0. 1544 (5 mag.) south. Thi8 pair had a meridional difference of zenith distauee of about fourteen minutes, and it was desired to rea<l each star equally distant from the center of the micrometer rack. Uad. 1311 was observed for time upon the first five transit threads, thus including the meridional thread. The micrometer was unclarnped, turned 900 to the stop, clamped. Tile latitude circle had been placed nearly iu a<lj11Ktment, but the telescope was moved slightly in altitude to observe the star near a given part of tlw micrometer; the latitude level was set and clamped to suit this change. Then three micrometer measures were ma.de upon the star,t and the chronometer times and the micrometer rf'.adi11gs rc·corded in sixty-one seconds, and finally the level was read. The third observation was nm·ll' at ~ ' 20· after the transit of the middle thread, lea\-ing 2m 42" t-0 the next star of the pair. The four frame clamping-screws were now removed, the instrument turnetl to the south, aud three micrometer measures and the readings aml times noted and level read. Similar oh;ervations were made upo11

Level: N. end. 34.7 At third observation, 41.::J 34.6 At fifth observation, 41.4 Indicating the stallility of the instrument and the absence of flexure in the telescope or in the vertical clamp. After the twelve pairs of latitude stars were observed, the two frames were clamped when the stud was at the stop; the micrometer turned 00° to the set-screw and clamped thereat, ready for the transit work of the next night. Objection has beeu made to the m;e of this method of determining the latitude on geographical reconnaissance, on account of the length of time requiretl for the different operations. The actual time and latitude lists obse1Ted are appended, to indicate what may be done in a reasonably short time. It will be noticed that the last eight stat'S for time and azimuth and collimation occupy but one hour, and the first nine pairs for latitude but one hour and twenty-three minutes, in all two hours and twenty-three minutes. Previous discussions of actual field work show that the probable error of the clock correction does not exceed :I:: O·.O:> when eight stars haYe been employed, arnl that with twelve pairs of latitude stars the probable error of the latitude therefrom does not exceed ±0."!W.

DrvrnroN CoAs·r AND GEODETIC SFRVlJY, December 9, 1879. nEAr. Sm: Tl1e den·lopme11t of the primary triangulation to the sonthwa]'(l and westward of \\'asllingto11, D. C. 7 between tlw years lSllS and 1878, and "-hicl1 gani au additional extent of nearly 600 statute miles to the ohliqne arc along our Atlantic Coast, brougllt out the fact that the geodetic latitudes, used up to the present time in this region, arc no longer in close accord witll the astronomical nwasures nrntle tluring tlH' abon~ periotl on the southwesteru exteusiou of this arc. Iiefore ~·onr 1lirections, attached to my report of May rn, 1879, conl<l be mtrried out, it was essenti:tl to snbmit the local deflections of the plumu-line * of the primary tria,ngnlation between Maine and Georgia to a 1ww discussion, aud, further, fo render this discus1iion usefnl for the elucidation or :-wttlernent of the important <1uestiou whether the Besselia11 or Clarke's spheroid uettcr suited the figure of tl1e t\arth's snrface aloug which our arc extends. This of course also iu vohw1 the discussion of Uw gemletic azimuths, as well as the georletic longitw.les, allll it is this last consideration which has (lelayed thfa report some months, since the important result of the telegra,phic lougitude of Atlanta, Ga., was absolutely needed for the completion of the necessary data. The local deflections were brought out by rn.1-sclf iu ~ornmlier, 1878, and the discussion was c<1mplete<l last J\Iarel1, requiriug now ouly tlle introduction of the uew result for telegraphic lougitmle of Atlanta, Ga., just reached by l\lr. l\I.

Co:)IP1JTING
DETER:cl-fINATION OF THE STANDARD GEODETIC LATITUDE.

The geodclic latitudes of the primary triangulation have necessarily been changeu from time to tirne as the field and office work progressed. Every additional astronomical latitude and every refinement iu the adjustment of the triangulation produces a small correction to thn value preYionsl,Y used. The last general change was made in 1863t when the standard latitude of Blue IIill, J\Iass., wmi iucrcased by 0".240 7 and the value so increased (4:.lO 121 4211 .140) was introduced into the geographical positions about 18tiu. Tliis value rests on 20 astronomical stations between Cooper, 1\le., and Sandford, Conn. Our present triangulation comprises 58 stations,t and extends to Georgia. The utilization of this accumulated material alone would have demanded a new discussiou, even apart from other considerations. The immediate occasion, J1owever, which determined me a year ago to take up this suQ.ject was the following fact: \Vhen the northern geodetic latitude was carried southward through the Blue Ridge triangulation into North Carolina, and there cornpare<l at the junction line with Assistant Boutelle's southern latitudes l>r0t1ght up from Georgia aml South Carolina, a discre1iaucy of 3" .95 appeared;§ the triangulations seemed to overlap, and thus 11lainly indicated that the triangulation had been <levelope(l upon a spheroi(i too small to eorrespond to tl1e earth's size. The conclusion supposes that our uuit of length is correct, but abont this there could he no doubt. To determine a standard geodetic latitude relative to an

adopted spheroid (which shonld he a close approximation to the arnrage fignre and to the size of the earth), we use the mean result of all astronomical latitudes reduced geodetically to the middle latitude of the arc, or we satisfy the condition that the sum of the differences of the astronorni<'.al and geodetic latitudes shall he zero, as {'xprcssed hy !: (A - G) = O; that i;;, the latitudes will balance about the middle point. Practicallr tlle astronomical latitudi·s are irregularly diRtrihnted, and in order to obtain a corrPct result the further condition tl1at the astronomical latitude ;;;tations should be equally di8tributed oYer the arc should be satisfied in some wa~-, otherwise the local deflections of the plumb-line would introduce unequal weights~ and thus di~place th(· position of tlle triangulation on the surface of the spheroid. For in::;tancc, near arnl uortlt of Philadelphia tllerc is awaYe of deflection hctwccn 6" and 7", and if sc1eral or more than the an·ragl' 1m111hcr of astronomical stations 1rerc located 1rithin its hrfiucncc an erroneous ;-alnc for the standard gco· detic latitude wonld Jtece11sarily he obtained, since the result, as found by '!:(A - C) = O, would accommodate itself to this abnormal feature. To secure equal weight to each part of the arc antl at the same time make use of all the astronomical stations, no matter wltetlwr they arc greatly crowded together in number in one place (as near "·ashingt-On) or sparsely inserted iu anoth<'r (as in North Carolina, and Yirginia), the follo\d11g method was emplo;rnll: The local deflections wer.plotted as showu by dots in tlw accumpau~·ing diagram, and a smooth mu.-e was drawn hetwecu and following them as closely as possible. To do tliis a mere free-hand curn' would he too arbitrary aml unsatisfactory, hnt by apvlying· the process of su.ccc~sin: means, and limiting· onrseln·s to the third order of meaus, the smooth curYe of local deflections in the meridiau \Yas obtained, aR shown on the diagram. Ordinates to the central axis, marked O, wl1ich represents the nndistnrhell or geometrical zenith referring to Bessel's spheroid, were then dra wu, or supposed drawn, say for every quarter or for m·ery fifth of a dcgTcP of latitude. Tims in the latter case ii ordinates i11tl'rsecting the smooth cmTe of deflections and representing magnitude of detlection, equally di;;trihuted, were obtained for each degree of latitude, and the 5(i values so found were made to take t lit· place of the 58 differences* A - G depeuding· directly on the observed latitudes. This trt'>atmc11t supposes a continuity, in a general way at least, of the larger waYes of deflection as distinct from features quite local, tlle two however combining to i1roduce the more or less irreg·ular position of dots of deflection, as shown in the diagram. \Yhcn the principal part of the lot'al dl'lh·ctio11s is removed by the process explained, there remains the wayy outline of tllc larger or more. cxte11dnl disturbances which have their origin in cam;es operating· in the same sense over large traets of country. That the greater part of the deflections of the plumb-line ma~· result from nneqnnl <listributiou of the density of the earth's crust below the surface, and the smaller part from its visihle irregularities, has been sufficiently demonstrated, and little would he gainCll for our purpose wen· we to attempt to correct for the supposed disturbing effect of the presence of the sea, or for surrounding hills. Appendix A, Table 1, contains in tabular form the astronomical latitudes, and needful information connected therewith. Appendix A, Table 2, contains the astronomical and correspomling geodetic latitudes, tl:e latter as they actually stand at present in our registers of positions.

The value 1;<1> changes to +2''.685 and the starn1ard latitnde l>ecomes 39° 35 1 36".722. The correction ol1tained by the ot'd.ina:ry pTo~ess or +l".57 is changed by the introduction of ''Sugarloaf" aml ''Atlanta'' to +1". 72. The change in the adopted standard latitude w,mld only amount to+ 0".030 anti has not been introduce.!. [Note appended in Octooor, 1880.-Scn.]

This table, as well as Table 2, Appendix A, shows the unequal balance of the geodetic latitude as at present in use; the correction to it is by above u
<F 'a, -1: .0. -u= 5

+ 2".G55. Had we followed the

ordinary process, taking no cognizance of the distribution of tbe astronomical latitudes, the correction would have been + l".57. The new standard geodetic latitude for the whole arc, and for the station I'rincipio, which is nearest to its middle point, becomes accorclingly 390 35' 34".037 + 2".65:3 = 39° 35' 36".692 = <p0 'l'he probable uncertainty of this -value is ± 0".30. Contrasting this value with the average probable error of a single aRtronomical latitude determination; :I:: 0".07, we see the overwhelming influence of local attraction combined with imperfect assumption as to the figure of the earth. The value 90 being introduced in the position computation (together with corrected values for "· and ). 0 , given further ou ), will produce the best latitude which the data afford, and if another spheroid be substituted, the same standard values ¥'o, a 0 , 20 should be employed, in order that the two sets of deflections for the spheroids may he directly comparable.
DETERMINATION OF THE STANDARD GEODETIC AZIMUTH.

The treatment of the astronomical and geodetic azimuths is similar to that employed for the latitudes. In 1863 and 186(l the geodetic azimuths were increased by+ 211 .2 and+ 2".4, the latter as determined from a comparison at 23 astronomical stations between Howard, Me., and West Hills, N. Y. The standard geodetic azimuth so corrected in 1866 is Blue Hill to Copeeut, 3550 14' 56".36. The present list of azimuths, given in Appendix B, Table 1, oontains 48 sfutions· between Howard, Me., and Lavender, Ga. This table gives the results of the astronomical azimuths; the probable errors gi-ven are intended to be the combined errors of observation and of transfer to triangulation; but certain parts of the column need further critical examination if used for other t11an the present purpose. Appendix B, Table 2, contains the astronomical and corresponding geodetic azimuths as given by our present registers of positions; also, their di:li"erences, or the deflection in the direction of the plane of the meridian. For the full exposition of the deflection of the vertical it is, however, more convenient to convert the azimuthal deflection into prime vertical deflection or int.o deflection in a plane at right angles t,o that for which the latitude deflections have ah"t'.ady been stated, and

further to convert the deflection8 in longitude into defiection8 iu the prime vertical, thu8 makiag the azimuthal and longitudinal differences directly comparable. They are clo8ely relatd, and the di8tance and direction of tlle di8turbed from the urnlisturbed zenith at any one place can h·\ equally deduced either lly means of the latitude and azimuth or lly means of the latitude and lougitmlt> as observed at the place. 0 Let 6 a= deflectiou iu azirnutlt, 6p =deflection of plumb·liue in the prime nrtical, cp = latitude of the place; then 6 p = - 6 a cot 'h by which formula the numbers in the last cohunn of TaLle '..l have bt.,>t.1u computed.

whereas in the latter case they are more nearly free of them if the arc be a meridional one; but in an oblique arc the angular errors of the triangulation enter more or less in both directions.
DETERMINATION 01·' THE STAND.ARD GEODETIC LONGITUDE.

Respecting longitudes our data are comparatively scanty, and as the distribution of the telegraphic longitude stations is tolerably regular, after omitting certain stations as too imperfect (Jerse,y City,~- J., Philadelphia, ll. S., J>a., and Staunton, Va.) and otliers as too close to principal stations (Duxbury, Mas:s., to Cambridge, and Seaton to Naval Observatory, Washington), the deflections of the vertical in longitude are easil.Y exhibited. The longitude results are fhml, except that reaction from additioual lougitmle measures on the present values may change the least s11nare at~justment by a small irn101mt. The standard longitude adopted and introduced in onr registers, viz: Camllridgc, Mass. (E. transit), 41t 4J-m ;:~o·.85, was approved April 2, 1869, and iu my report of May 2!J, 187:J, I fnrtlter sltow that this standard longitude very nearly equalized the differences between the telegravliie and the geodetic longitudes at the stations'Oalais, Me., Cambridge, ~fass., New York, X. Y., autl \Vashiugtou, D. 0. In the place of i we now have 7 longitude stations bearing on tlw arc; tlte rcst1lts are gin~n in Appendix C, Tahle 1. In the second tal>Ie of this appendix the astronomical longitudes are expres:scd iu arc and compared with the register lougitude:s. 'l'he differences :::iJ, arc eonyerted iuto difforeuce:s up in the prime w.rtical by the relation up= 61.cosp ·which quantities ~tre shown by crosses on the diagram containing similar quantities derirnd from the azimutlJs. ·we have tlle correction ~'S'p = - 1".28~* and reverting to longitude uJ. = /',p j :sec 9' the eorrectiou to the lougitmle becomes -1".673, the value of 9' being 3()0 .35'.6. Nearly ouetenth of a secoml of time is to subtracted from our register longitudes, and the new standard geodetic l011gitmle of Principio becomes 760 00' 1811 .080 -1 11 .673 = 760 001 1611 .407 = ),0 The probable uncertainty of this value is ± 1".2, whereas tlrn a'"erage prollable error of a single longitude determination is but ± 011 .8 It; for any one astronomical station where latitude, azimutl:, aIHl longitude were determined, the values of :c,.p as derived from the obsen·ed and as derived from the observed ..l, differ by more than their rmipective probable obsen"ing errors would indicate, the explanation will be found in the fact that the accmnulatetl errors of the angular measures of the tdaugulatiou had been left out of account.

EXIIIllITION OJ< THE APPARENT LOCAL DEFLEC'.L'IONS OF THE VER'l'ICAL WI'.L'H REFERENCl<: TO BESSEL'S AND CLARKE'S SPHEROIDS.
l~or the direct comparison of the remaining deflections of the plumb-line on the two spheroids we have only to develop the triaugulation upou their respective surfaces, starting with the same starnlard geodetic latitude, longitude, and azimutl!, or with the values 'fo ). 0 a 0 for the miudle station Principio, as deduced on the preceding pages. It might appear, at first, as if the old position computation for Bessel's spheroid could be made use of by appl,Ying the change in the data, or+ 2".655 in latitude, + 011 .342 in azimuth, and -1 11 .673 in longitude as so many constants, but the change in latitude i8 so great that the relative positions become affocted, considering the whole arc, to ~tu extent to tell nearly on the tenths of sec-0mls in the latitudes and even on the nearest whole se0ond in azimuth, but less in longitude (about 011 .3). A partial recomputation of the positions had to be made for Bessel's spheroid, and, of couri:;e, a new computation for Clarke's spheroid.t The results are given in full in the following table: ------. ---------------------

.The values originally reported wore -l".120, and, for 6il, -1".453; but they have now boon improved by the introduction of the results from tlie least square adjustment of the telegraphic longitudes in August, 1880, and by the revised longitude of Statetiville, N. C., which before restP,tl 111>on a rough computation ma.de in the field. [Note added in October, 1880.-Scn.] t For a similar roaeon the small corrections in latitude of+ 0".030, and in azimuth of - 0".066, as mentioned in t.wo preceding foot-notes, and which are due to the iutrotluctiou into the original paper of two additional latitudes and of one ILzimuth, were 11ot introduced here, eijpecially 8ince these corrections are far within the limits of the probable errors of the values of qio and of <ro. It is different, lmwever, with the longitude for which the new value or .l., = 750 00' 16".407 baa been iutroduood, and to which value the longitude tables appended have also been made to conform.

Respecting the signs in the columm~ of A - G, they ham the following meaning: For latitudinal deflections a + sign indicates zenith thrown to the north (or plmuh-line to the south) ; a - sign the reverse. For azimutlwl deflections a + sign indicates zenith thrown to the eaRt (or Routh meridian thrown to the east); a - sign the reverse. For umgitudinal deflections a + sign indicates zenith thrown to the west; a - sign the re\·erse. Squaring the numbers of the last two eolumns, headed A- G, we hase the following comparison for the sum of the squares, or ~(A -G)2, and for the square root of the mean square or for the a>erage deflection:

For our Atlantic coast the superiority of Clarke's over Bessel's spheroid is therefore demonstrated. While the latitudes are fairly better represented on the surface of Clarke's spheroid, the azimuths are improved but a trifle ; in fact, they are almost indifferent as to tho one or the other of the spheroids (the signs at the beginning and end of the columns (A - G) simply change from - + to+ - ). On the other hand the longitudes are 1ery greatly impro1ed, the smn of the 11pw differences being nearly one-half of that of the former differences. In Yiew of these facts, alHl considering that this paper contains the largest induction the present state of the surwy a1fonls, I 110 not hesitate to respectfully ask your attention to the question wl1ether the survey would not hr benefited by the adoption of Clarke's spheroid as its surface of development. It would seem to me that the present time is favorable for making this fundamental change, since nearI~- all th1e State surveys are yet in their infancy, so that no time would be lost in starting at once the Oeodetic survey on Clarke's spheroid, and allowing the Bessel spheroid to gradually disappear witl1 Uw olll Coast Survey work. The use of Clarke's spheroid, as recommemletl in my report of March 2S, 1S7S, was only partia11y ru:lopted, i. limited to the triangulation of the Pacific coast. At the time this was approved by you we were not in possession of so complete a proof for the Atlantic coast as is now offered for your consideration. With a few S}lecial exceptions (longitudes) the astronomical results given in this paper, and the results of the 600 miles of primary triangulation southwest of Washington, are as yet unpnhlished. The character of the deflections between Calais, Me., and Washington, D. C., has long been known in this office ; the heavy deflections in latitude in the region abo11t Boston had already been brought to light by the Borden survey,· and in January la.st Prof. Young, of Princeti0n, N .·J.,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

wrote he had a difficulty in reconciling 1 his astronomical aml our geodetic latitude and longitude. He was informed of the existence of a wave of deflection iu that region. This latitude deflection had already been mapped in 1856. The deflection of the plumb-line. in the vicinity of ·washington is Yery remarkable, the zenith heing heavily drawn to the east or the plumlJ-line attracted to the west. The object of this report, however, is not a discussion of the local deflections, but a comparison of the value of two spheroids with regard to their respective fitness for the Coast and Geodetic Suryey. Physically the Atlantic arc, which is now 1200 statute miles in length, can he extended 42° to Mobile Point, increasing the prese11t length from 1i ~o to 22°; its value for geodesy would thus be increased 25 per cent., and the Atlantic and Gulf coast triangulations would be united. I remain, sir, yours, very respectfully, CHAS. A. SCHOTT, As.~istant in charge Computing DiviHion.

ON THE SECULAR ClIANUE OF MAGXET1C DECLINATION IN THE UNl'l'ED STATES AND AT SOME .FOHEIGN STATIONS. BY CHARLES A. SCHOTT, ASSJST,<\NT COAST AND GEOHETIC SURVEY.
[~'ourth

edition, June,

111.~l.*J

The present inYestigatiou incorporates the additional obsernttious made or collected 8ince June,
18i!I (date of Uie last e1lition), aml containR the extended aml impr(rrnd rmmlts of old stations as

well :ts those for a number of 1101v loc.tlities. The geogr.iphica1 muge of the lliscnssion includes ~1 station in Europe, a station in Brazil, two on the Sandwich Islands, and oue in Asiatic Hussia. The demand for the contents of tllis article llas been constantly on the increase, not only by scientistR and surveyon;, but also by lawyers, arising chiefly from cases of disputed land boundaries, which originally had been nm hy compass and are uo~v required to be retraced. To reuder this investigation more useful to practical men, I have thought it Llesirable to preface it by a brief account of the nirious and principal motions, systematie aIHl irreguhtr, to whicll the direction of the magnetic needle is subject, and thus clearly to separate and distinguish these eltanges from the secular chang<', which is here the special ol\ject of treatment. 'l'heoreticall.r, a knowledge of the secuhtr change is of great importance aml practically is indispensable iu order that the coast charts published by this ofllee ni<L)- be supplied with the variation of the compass for the date of issue. The magnetic declination (or variation of the compassi as it was formerly called by surveyors and still is by navigators), at auy place, is tlie angle contained between two vertical planes, one heing the astronomical or trne meridiau, aud the other a plane in whicll the horizontal axis of a freely strnpended magnet lies at tlte time. The fimncr plane is fixed; the latter variable, since it is fouud that the needle i.,; in a state of coutiunal motion. Tue magnetic declination varies with re:;pect to space and time; it h·, therefore, necess~try to gi\·e with the statement of its measure the exact time (year, day, and hour) when an observation was made, as well as tlle geographical position of the place (tlte latitude and longitude to the nearest minute of arc). The declination is called "west" when the north end of tlte mag·uet poiuts to the west of .true north; algebraically this fact is indicated by a+ sign, and if "east" by a - sign. It is a matter of observation that the magnet, when ligl1t and delicately suspernled (by a single fiber of raw silk), is sel!lom or never at rest, but is always shifting ]ts direction, or is in a state of oscillation or of tremor, or it may be of sudden chau~es. These angular motions h:we heen classified as regular (periodic) and irreg·ular varia· tions, and of these we propose to uotice briefly the principal ones, such as may generally be exhibited within the limits of the United States. The solar-diurnal variation consists in a systematic movement of the magnet, having for its period the solar day. Its character is the same for the greater part of the northern hemisphere, viz, about the time of sunrise the north eml of the needle is generally found approaching to or uear its most easterly deflection from the average magnetic meridian. This phase happens, for instance, at Plliladelphia, on the yearly average, about 7 lh a. m.; at Key ·west, I<'la., about Si;h a. m.; and the same at .i\fadiso11, "-is. It is snliject to all annual variation, being about {/; of an hour later in the months wheu the sun is south of the PIJtrntor, aud about ~ of an hour earlier in the summer months than its yearl,v average epoch. The north end of the needle tlten begins its principal dail;v motion, and reaches the opposite extreme position, or its western elongation, about llalf past
·This paper originally appeared in Coast Sun-ey Hq1ort for 1859, Appendix No. 24, pp. 2'J6-305. In tho second Pditiou, in Coast Survey Report for 1»74, Appendix .No. 8, l'l'· 72-101!, the iU\·.,,..tigation appears greatly extended; the substitution of a sine for a co8ine function wa· made and t.1111 e'11<1eh was changed from 1830 to 18.'lO; also wrue use wa,s made of Cauchy's met bod of interi·olation for the estahlikhme1Jt, of s<>Ultl second iieriodic terms.

1 o'clock p. ru. It is reached a few minutes earlier in summt~r and a few minutes later in wiuter, and hardly varies ha1f an hour for different localities. .After this epoch tl1e needle takes up an easterly movement, and gradually returns nearJ,y to the direction from which it set out iu the morning. Frequently an interruption, or small rm-ersed motion: i.s cxhiuiteu during the uight. 'l'lie ' a. rn. aml iu wiutcr about 10] 1' a. m. at average daily direction is reaclwd iu summer about 101 1 Philadelphia,, and generally within half au hour of thet>e timet> at other places. The maguetic meridian is crossed a second time, generally Letween i anu !J p. rn. The augular range between the morning and afternoon elongations, or the diurnal range, is about 8' on the average at Jlbiladelphia and about 5:!' at Key 'Vest; in higher maguetic latitudes more, in lower less. 'J.'his range is subject to au annual inequality, being- much wore cou:spicuons in summer tliau iu winter (10:2' at Pbiladelphia in .August and fY in NoYember). It is further sul~jeet to a, perio!lic inequality related to the eleveu-.rnar cycle of the sun-spots. It is least in years of minimum stm spots (as iu 1878, for instance) ancl greatest in ~·ears of maximum sun-spots (aEI in 1870) the factors beiu~ 0. 7 ancl 1.:~, about, of the aYerage amount of these years rm;pedinl~-. This !laily variation appears at times intensified, at other timet> eufoeliled, and during the winter months there are Lla,ys 011 which it cannot Le recognized. Obser\·ations must he corrected for time of day iu order to reduce the result to the average direction of the :?4 hours; a table gin~n for this purpose is found in Coast Survey Report of 1875, p. 2G3. The annual variation of t11e declination is so small tl.H1t a mere mention of its exii,;teuce suftice:-;; its amplitude is at most 1~ minute of arc. The lunar inequalities: These we likewise pasi,; O\'er 011 account of their small amplitude. The principal inequality is the lunar diurnal Yariation exbil.Jiting the peculiarity of two maxima and two minima values on each lunar day. Tlie range of tliis inequality at Philadelphia is about 2i", and at Toronto, Canada, ahot1t 38 11 · Other lunar inequalities are of yet smaller order. The secular change of the magnetic deeli1wtion, our subject proper, is most i1roba1.Jly ah;o of a periodic character, but since it requires centuries for its full deYelopment, awl as yet no one c~·cle has actually been completed within the r.mge of observation, we arc obliged, iu the absence of any reliable theory, to follow up tl.ie phenomena b.f coutiuuous obsernttions. Tlms from time to time our prm-ious deductions or supposed hnrn ueed cliangiug or amending in order to presern.1 the required harmonious relations with faeb;. The sccuhr motion may he compared with a w:n-e motion or with au oscillation of a i)enduluq1 wl1ieh comes to rest momentarily at its extreme po;;itions or elongations and moves fastest midl\·ay between these extreme,;. Smaller Yariations within this period have also been detected, but the general moYemeut (of the uorth end) of the magnet ma~' be described as follows: About the times of maximum detfoction the magnet appears almost stationary or oscillating about the siime a\"cragc directiou (to ordinary or rongh iustrument1') for several years; soon, however, tlie effect of the secular change IJecomes perceptible, increasing gradually, year by year; the progressive motion soon reaches an annual maximum chauge, after which it slowly diminishes, becoming stationary at the opposite extreme digression and possibly returning again to its first position. "'ithin the area of the United States and south of latitude 490 a complet~ oscillation of this kind may require between two and a half and three and a half centuries, during which time the magnet would swing twice through an arc of se\~cral degrees, ge11erally keeping within the limits of 3° and jo of total range for our geographical boundaries; iu other localities the period and range is Yery much greater. The great regularity of the motiou is well shown on the aceom1mnying diagram for l'aris, :France, for which place we possess tlw longest series of observations; the period is about 4a centuries, aud the rauge uearly J3°. To illuiitmte further the effect of the secular change we may take the case of New York City. In this locality the needle was observed to be in nearly a stationary condition about rnsti, pointing then !P to tlie west of north; it then mo,·e<l easterly and reached its easterurnost digl'ession al.lout 1 Wi, slt0wi11g at tliat time ouly 40 west declination. Ever since tl1is epoch the motion has been wet>terly, i ti; yalue being now 7~0 "\V.; the greate8t mumul change (nearly ii') hm; apparently heen passed. The times of these stationarJ epochs arc difforent at different localities; the last epoch was noted earliest in Maine, later in :Florida and Texas, and has uot yet been reaeltetl in California. At present, all along our Atlantic and Gulf coasti:;, and over the middle allll eastern partt> of the United States, the effect of the secular change is to increase wet>t declination, or (what is the salll~)

ea.~t declination; but on the Pacific coast and for some distance interior the effect is opposite, Yiz, an increase of east declination. Alaska, howe,·er, is to be excepted; there easterly deelination seems to tlecrease slowly. ~'lwre must, conser]lwntl,r, be a region of no change, which will be noticed farther on. 1t is thi8 motion, known as the secular change, which renders it necessary to recoHstrnct from time to time our isogouic cliarhl. Alt.hough the secular change is perfectly regular it may not ahvays 11ppear so, especially when deduced from few obsernttiom; made at diftere11 t stations in the same geuernl locality, either on account of small observing errors and possible local detlectiom;, or for the reason that ordiuary perirnlic variations and disturbances are not full.r rliminated. Among the latter must be classed tbeJfo!]netfr disturbance~; these may occur at auy t.ime, allll are, when takeu individually, beyond the power of prediction i lmt attacked by the statistical method, i. e., when cla8sifiell and averages ar{' taken of many thonsands, they are found to he subject to various laws. Their 11resence is generall.v indicatc11 by sudden deflections and by rapid and great ffuctnatious iu the direction of the needle as compared with its normal position, which otherwise might have been expected. They of'tcu take place simultaneously at distant regions of the globe and in duration may be confined to a few hours, or tlwy may last a day or eYen for several days. They arc frequently accompanied by auroral lights aml by strong electric earth-currents. \Yheu aualyzetl in large numbers they exhibit a ;;olar-dinrnal variation, the westerly and eastel"ly uisturbauce8, lwwever, following different lawis. 'l'Iwy also hn rn an annual variation and seem to depend large!,\· on the sun-spot period or an eleYenyear ('.rde. Irrespecti\·e of direction of the disturbing forces the most disturbed hours of the 1la.r are g'Ciu·rally those hetween ih and IOit a. m., and the least disturbed those between 2 11 and 6 11 p. m. \V t>isterly tlistur11;111ces ocenr most frequentl.\· about Sh a. m. aIHl least about Sh p. m. They exhibit :i t:-1i11gle 1bil,Y progression. Easterly llii-;turba.nees reach a maximum about 8 11 p. m. and a minimum about 2i. p. m. ; they exhibit a double daily progreRsion. "'eskrly and easterly disturbances appear to agTee in their annual variation, in their times of maxima, i. e., in .August, September, and Octoher, and in their times of minima, i. e, in Jannar;r and .Tnne.

IIISTORICAL N01'E.

'!'lie following brief J1istorica.l remarks on the magnetic declination aml its secular Ymiation were extracted from Ilmnboklt's Cosmos tOtte's translation, I1omlo11, 1849-18.'JS), vols. II and V; from tlw Encyclop:t'!lia Jfritauuicn, Uth edition, Art. Compass, Yo!. VI (Boston, 1877), and from E. \\'alkcr's treati8e Terrestrial and Cosmical Magnetism, Cambridge (England), 1866, in which works fuller n·frn~uces will lie fonllll.

ceutury n. C., and, according to traditio11, even at a Yer~- much earlier time (~11:31 n. l'). In 1lw third aml ibnrth centuries of onr era, Chinese yesselfl were guided by the magnetic 11ee<1le, and through them a knowledge of the polarity of the needle was co1ffcyctl to India, and tl1e11c(· west. ward. Ju the ninth century Chinese merchants traded in ships to the Persia11 Gulf and the Heil Sea. Probably through the influence of Arabian mtYig·ators, or through the agency of the crusaders, the use of the mariners compass wa8 introduced into Eastern Europe. Among the fir;;t European writers of t11P middle agps who rt·fer to the loaclstone or to the com pas:,:: is the foelamli1· historian, Are Frode, who li\-ed about the eml of the cJe,·enth eentnr,L Ile states that the llirect1n property of the loadsto11e was then knowJJ to Reamen in northern countriPs. }frxt, Alexarulpr Neckam, in two treati8es, "De Utensilibus" and "De Naturis Hernm,'' of the hrelfth century; Guyot, of l'rovins, in ll!IO, aml Jaques de Vitry, behrneu 120! and 1213. ltaymond Lull,\·, in 127:.! and 1286, r_emarkR tllat the seamen of l1is time ernplo~-ed the magnetic needle, and from 'l'orfa·n;:: we learn that the compass was in use amoug the Norwegians about the middle of the thirteenth century. Among western nations the construction of the instrunwnt umlerwent great impron·ments, particularly by the hands of Flavio Gioja, of Amalphi, in 1302. The dcclination.-J<'rorn a Chine8e work written between 1111 and 1117 A. D., we learn that the needle was then suspended hy a thread, and that the mode of rneaRnring thP amount of thr 1lec1inatio11, it being tl1en west (or as rx1n·cRsed east of south), had long been mHlPrstoml, and it can hardly be supposed that the fact. of the needle, in general, not ])Ointing to the true north arnl south could htn-c lwen o\-erlooked in the twelfth centnr;1-, on the Metliterraneau, in places wlterP the declination reacl1r1l C. 0 or 10°. A passage iuterpolatecl in a Pari:> :MS., a copy of "Epistola l'etri Peregrini, &c.,'' of 126!1, states the declination t,o haYe been tletcrminetl hy him iu Haly at 50 B. Columlms probably was the first who records the clm11g-e in the declination with clrnng<' of position. On starting from the west coast of Spain he had east dPclination. In September, U!l~, in latitude 28° longitude 2so (~tbont) he obflern·tl ll 0 IY. Ile has also the merit. of being thP 1ir,.;t to <liscoYer a part of an agouic line. The first scientific work in Europe iu which the dt>i'li11ation i8 treated at any length and deduced from actual ohsen-ations is that by Boroughs, pnhli,;lwd in 1581, entitled "A discourse on the Yariation of the Cnmpas or :rtlagneticall ueetlle,'" aud i,.; dedicatetl to the "travaillers and mariners of l~nglaud." In lii!.!U, Jlriuce Maurice, of Nassau, the lortl l1igh-admiral of.the Low Countries, recommended seamen to keep a regif:trr of ilie dPcJinatiou in cver;r iiart of the world they might yisit. lsogonic Charts.-Tlte declination was marked on the chart of Andrea Dianco, drawn np in the J&'1r 1436, aml Alonso de Santa Cruz, in 15:m, constrnctetl tlle first general declination chart, though based upon yery imperfect material Upon the chart by Father Chri:,::topher Bmru,.; (dit>1l in 1632), published at Lisbon, the lines are called" tract.us chalylloelitif'.Ds." Abont 170 years after Alonso de Santa Cruz, Bd w. Halley published his celebrated isogonic chart for the ;1-ear 1700, based entirely upon observations. jTabnla Nantica, Yariationnm J\fagneticarnm Index, jnxta obser,·ationes anno 1700.J His yoyages of the ~-ears 1!WS, 169H, and 1702 were mHlertakPn at tlw px1iense of the Rritish Go,-ernment,.

In 1635 he published his work entitled, "A discourse matlwmatieall 011 the Variation of the Magneticall Needle, together with its admirable diminution lately <lisro\·cre,l.'' He based llis conclusions upon tl1e recorded ohscrrntions of Boreughs (1580), of Gu11tPr (1G2'.!): and his own obserrntions (1633-'3!), showing that in the vicinity of London the dirPction of the nt>edh· ha.d changed in the interval fully 70 to the westward. Prom this time the fact of thP ;::pcnlar Yariation was completely established, and it remained to later times to determine itt; extent and develop the law governing this change, and endeavor t-0 fincl its rntuse. That the Yelocity was not uniform was soon percei\·ed, and the apparent perioclie character of the Yariation was promineutly forced upon the attention of the observers when the needle reacl1ed a st.ationary coudition, as for instance, in the eastern part of the Unitell States towards the end of t,he eighteenth cet\tury, and

In some cases where certain observations were C\-identls less trustworthy than others, yet which nevertheless coulll not be dispensed with owing to the small numher of ohsernitions, or on account of their special valne with reference to time, special weigl1ts were assigned to tl1ese obsernitious; generally each observation received the weigl1t unity, a few imperfect obserYatio11s tlie weight one·half. 111 these cases the conditional equations wen· multiplied b;r the square root of their respective weight. Of obsernitions eddently grossly in error uo notice whaternr was taken. lu finally selecting what seemed to be the best expression for the secular chitnge at a st;1tioa, I have also occasionally been guided by the accord of the ,·ariom; values entering into the e.qm1tion when compared with corresponding values in the equations for surrounding stations. \Yhen appl,yiug Cauchy's method of interpolation the form

was found more com·enient in use. This method was employed for establishing such second or tbh'<l periodic terms as appeared demanded by the observations, but ouly a few of these could be determined and they generally failed on account of insufficiency of obsen·atfons or for want of sufficient accuracr.

Jn other caseR the obsernitio11s twident ly were not eorrect('d for 1liurnal Yariation, and the honr of the dar of ohRernition not hring kno\\n the receiYed imperfect value had to be accepted. There are a f<"w stations where from want of a snffieient number of ohservations, or from shortness of record between the first and laRt obseiTation, no period of the secular change eould be made out. In such cases the annual change rlne to the secular motion ma;y he expreRse<l hy means of an exponential function, thus:

D =do+ y (t - to) + Z (t - to)2 + .. , ,
where do= magnetic declination at epoch t 0 · I adopt, a'1 in the preceding formula·, t 0 = 18;"10.0 and put d0 = IJ + x, where IJ =an approximate value of an<l .r a correetion to it to he determined, as well as y and z, &c., from the ohsen'ations themseln'R.

a =annual change = y + 2.z (t - to) = y + 3z. m ; also
T = time of maximum declination =

In case the change of declination can be represented hy a straight line, we haw D = d0 +a (t - t 0 ) and the conditional equation 0 =do - D +a (f - t,,) ·where d,, =mean of all observed declinations, aml t0 =mean of corresponding times. The principal uncertainty in the investigation thus arises partly from large ohsen-ing or im1trnmeutal errors in the older observations made with ordinar,\· compasses or with rude instruments generally, and partly, in modern observations, since the introduction of more retine<l instruments (the magnetometer, with collimator magnet and the0tlolite) from change of local po~ition aml imperfect elimination of irregular variations from the normal direction of the magnet. From the extended use of iron and the rapid growth of cities, it is difficult to S('lect and pr('serYe at Rnch phlces a suitable locality for use at future times. Accurate investigations of the secular clrnuge can only be made at permanent magnetic observatories or in localiiies not liable t-0 disturbing

influences. S. Ex. 17--17

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

In applying at preseut a periodic fuuction for representing tlle secular clrnnge it should be understood that this rloes not necessarily imply that the phenomenon is a periodic one, or ha,s a period of the length assigned, or that it must exhibit a second and other periods of like character to t11e first, or ern11 that a first period will be completed without change of law.* The aim i8 simply t-0 represeut hy a suitable and comprnhensi.ve formula the changes which are obsen'ecl in the directio11 of the resultant horizontal magnetic force, aml to in·o\·ide the means for the further 8tmly of the phenomenon as well as for predicting, at least for a few years in ad\'ance, the vrohable dirf'ction of the needle as reqnirerl for 11se 011 Olll' 11ydrogra.phic charts. 'l'he process is thns one of a tentath'e character, and the formul1P are empirical. Employing- a formula of interpolation capable of rppresenting the phenomeno11 as far as obserYed, it would manifestl,Y be unsafe to extellll the numerical results beyond tl1e limits of observation, arnl they are here gi,·eu with in safe limits and should not he ext.emled unless it shouhl he fonud that additional observations sustain them.
f10LLEC'l'ION OF MAGNETIC DECLINATIONS FOR THE lHSf1USSION OF 'l'HE SECULAR QHANGE.

The collection of the material i8 presenterl first, the stations JJeiug arranged in approximately geogrnphical order, beginning in the northeast, passing to the south and west, and ending in the northwest. This approximates to an arrangement proceeding from the greatest western to the greate8t eastern declination. For each localit.y the observed tlecliuations are giyeu in chronological order, together with such notes and reference!\ re8pecting obser\'er, place, publication, etc., as could be sUpJllied. 'l'lrn stations here gi\·en are the only ones, as far as known, at presm1t suitable for a discussion of tlie secular change, hut it is expected that future accumulation and collection of data will render the character of the work more comprehensh·e and reliable than it can now he made.
~ff we snppo~e for the moment that the Recular change consists simply of a swing about a mean position, the deflecting force being a m:txinrnm at the times of elongation and zero for the epoch midway between, we may obtain some roup;h evaluation of tlw magnitude of the horiwntal t1P.flecting force wl1en greatest. Thus at Philadelphia t.he half-am11lituile or the secnla1· detlection either W:t.Y from the normal equals nearly :io.3, and the last extreme deflection 3 happene<l ahont 11307. At that time, then, the rleflecting force corrcApondetl to ,:" ·· = -1... nearly of the nonual hori3 1' ·">7 ·· zontal force acting in the plane of the meridian. This deflecting force is very much greater than the deflecting force whkh protlm·rs t.he 1laily solar variation, the latter being at most., at. Phila.delphia, for an averal{e amplitucle of

ANALYTICAL EXPRESSIONS OF THE OBSERVED DECLINATIONS.

The resulting empirical expressions for the secular change of the magnetic declination, given below, were derived from the prncediug observations by applying to them the harmonic analysis as explained in the preface. The stations are arranged geographically, as far as practicable, and their positions are given by latitude and longitude (west of Greenwich). Total number of stations 55, and of observations about 6!4. The epoch to which the formuhe refer is 1850 or m = t - 1850.0

To facilitate the comparison of the results at widely different localities there has been added to this paper the accompanying plate, headed "Secular change of the magnetic declination." It exhibits the observed and computed declinations for Paris, France, for New York, San Francisco, and for Sitka. The :first.named station bas been introduced for the special purpose of showing in a conspicuous manner the great regularity of the secular motion, and thus impressing the mind with the fact that the explanation of the secular change must ultimately be referred to forces of a periodic character acting for centuries with great regularity. So far no approach ha.a yet been ma.de towards the discovery of the cause of this motion. The diagrams also assist in connecting the phases of the secular change as exhibited for places in the United States with the correspond· ing phases of the motion in Western Europe and Eastern Asia. The following Table III shows for each station: (1) the number of observations used in the disoussion of the secular change, numbers in parentheses uncertain; (2) the apparent probable error, in minutes of arc, of one observation (including all sources of error, namely, those caused by imperfect value of the average declination due to variations of the needle, those caused by difference of location of station, those arising from purely instrumental defects, and those due t.-0 imper· footion of formula); t3) the computed epoch of greatest easterly deftootion reached in the secular motion, i. the date when last reached or the dare (in parentheses) when it is next expected. to be in that position; (4) the amount, in degrees and fractions, and direction (+ west,-east) at this the, nearest stationary epoch; (5) (6) and (7) the computed. annual changes for the epochs 1870, 1880, and 1885, expressed in minutes of arc, a + sign indicating north end of needle moving west"'*1'd, a - sign north end moving eastward.

UNITED STATES COAST AND G:ElODETI<J SURVEY.

169

The actual number of observations at Pro\'iLlence, R. I., and Hatborough, Pa., are uuknown, and probably are less than one.fourth of the values used in the discussion. The probable error;; given will serve to convey some idea of the relative value of each series of observations. The imperfections in the instrumental means and methods of the <ilder observations in many cases react unfavorably on the modern oUservations, which are made with more precise instruments and hy more refined methods. If we take, for instance, the observations of Hudson, made in 1609, in tlw ticiinity of New York, we find each fairly chargeable with a prollahle error of about:::!:: 4°. While these observations are very imperfect, those of Champlain of about the same period (1604 to J 612) are still cruder. These two navigators differ nearly 90 at the mouth of the Penobscot, Maine, and double this amount at Cape Cod. The observations made by Vancouver on our western coast, between 1792 and 1794, are subject to a prolJable uncertainty of :I: 10 (each). Increased precision was attaine(l with the improvement of the azimuth compass and b~· allowance for disturbiug effoct of the ship's iron, and, with respect to shore stations, greater accuracy was obtained by the introduction of the theodolite for determining the astronomical meridian. \Vith a portable rnagnerometer and a collimator magnet, the instrumental means need not introduce a greater uncer· tainty than about one minute; but the actual probable error of any determination is dependent also on the accidental variations in the mean direction of the magnetic force from day t~ day, thus making it desirable and indispensable for precise work to continue the observations for three or mo1·e days and to correct the results for lliurnal variation. The amount of the probable error of the ob· served declination depends also on the intensity of the horizontal component of the magnetic force at the place, i.e., in general the smaller the horizontal fo1·ce the larger the apparent proliable error. To facilitate the use of the deduced annual change for bringing observations up to date, and for a more comprehensive general view of its distribution in sign and amount, the Yalues of the last column but one of Ta!Jle III were laid down on the accomp~uying chart nearing the tit.le "Annual change of the magnetic declination," to which a few results derived from other sources, and discussed by means of exponential functions, ham been added. It will be seen that tlle annual change has the positive sign for by far the greater part of the United States, a belt of' negati ''e sign lying along the western coast. Between these two areas there is a region of present little or no change, the outlines of which cannot now be cxactl,y defined, nor has it been found, as yet, practicable to constnict a system of curves of equal annual change (such as was attempted for a limited area in Coast Survey Report for 1865, plate No. 28). The maximum amount of annual change, as charted, is in the vicinity of Lake Champlain, with an indication that it may l>e surpassed in Wisconsin. The pre8ent motion of the isogonic curves is southward along our Atlantic and Pacitie sea· boards, but slowly JJOrthward in the vicinity of Sitka, thus i)ointing to a region of no annual change between that }lla.ce and Vancouver'8 falall(l. There are also presented two agonic lines (or line8 of zero declination, the magnetic needle pointing due north), one for the e1loch 1790, when it and the system of isogonic lines in its neighborhood had reached nearly their extreme position to the northeast; the other for the epoch 1880; the space between them showing the shifting to the southwest of the first·named agonic line during the last 90 years. The agonic line is now in rapid motion to tlte south and west, carrying with it the system of otlier isogonic lines in its vicinity. A cursory examination of the column containing the eJlOch of the greatest easterly digression, a.t which time the dedecting force Jlfoducing the secular change had an easterly maximum, shows that in Western Europe (Paris) this phase of the secnla.r motion occurred about 1580; lint near the coast of the New England States the needle became stationary in direction and then reversed its previous angular motion at a v~ry much later epoch, viz, about or before 178(), Going westward or southward, this epoch was observed later, about 1800, in Indiana or Illinois, and ahont J 810 in Fl-Orida. It oecurred as late as 1836 (about) in Mexico, and 1835 (about) in Mississippi. Tl1e needle baa not yet reached this state in Lower California and along the western coast south of Vancouver's Island. This stationary condition may be expected on our western coaHt Houth of the Columbia River toward the close of the present or early in the next century. We a.re thus directed to look to the extreme northeastern limit of the United States for pro liable indications of the magnetic change, which may be expected to follow and spread from the 8eaboanl westward and southward. Respecting this secular change the phases of the phenomenon on the coast of Maine and the coast of California are almost in opposition. At t.he time when the needle

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENlJENT OF THE

took up its westerly motion in our Northeastern States in the last quarter of the past century, it had but for a short time acquired its easterly motion in the States of the western coast. At present in Nova Scotia the motion appears to be approaching its westerly extreme, and in California it is tending toward its easterly extreme. If we fix now for a moment our attention to the oi1posite or western extreme of stationary condition, which happened at Paris· about 1813, or GS years ago, we find that at Saint John's, Newfoundlaml, the needle had arrived at this phase about 1859, and at Halifax, Nova Scotia, we are led to expect it to occur shortly (about 1891). In the State of Maine, and further on to the west and south, this phase is expected to occur some time in the next centur;y. We thus see the progressive motion of the secular change from eastern to westem conntriPs, anll are enahled to take a more comprehensive view of the whole phenomenon. J,ooking over the numerical values of a in Table I, they would imply a secular-change cycle forstations in the United States extending over or varying between the limits of about 2_20 and 360 years; the numbers themseh·es are, however, yet very uncertain. On a third plate appended to this paper I have delineated the secular change of the agonic line of the North Atlantic, to illustrate the effect of the chang·e iu the declination in a manner quite diflerent from tabular numbers. It shows the position of this agonic line for the epochs 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, also for 1880 and 1900. The earliest position is more or less conjectural, and rests on the authority of Columbus for its place near the Middle Atlantic; we also know that it must have passed over a region near Paris, France, and not far from a region including tl;le Antilles. The position for 1600 is taken from Hansteen's work (1819) and may be considered as a rough approximation; it has been corrected by me near its western end. The position for 1700 is more reliable, since it depends on numerous observations collected by Halley; it is taken from bis chart. The positions for 18e() and 1880 require no further explanation. The position for l 900, though prospective, is quite certain. Upon the whole, the azimuthal motion of the isogonic system in the vicinity of the agouic line of the North Atlantic, and as represented hy this line, bas been, since 1600, in the direction of the hands of a watch.
TABLE OF DECENNIAL VALUES OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION COMPUTED FROM PRECEDING EQUATIONS.

Table IV has been constructed for the purpose of facilitating the reduction of observed declinations from one epoch to another, and for supplying the Coast Survey charts with the latest deducible declinations. These values will be found especially useful when old lines, originally run by compass needle, have to be retra<led at a later date, and they are also required for the construction of isogonic charts for a given e11och. Two places of decimals are given for all localities and dates for which the obset·vations wern considered reliable; one pla-ce of decimals indicates a less satisfactory result, and blanks indicate that no trustworthy results, or no results at all, could be bad. The table should not be extended eitlier hy interpolation or by extrapolation beyond its given limits except when supported by new eYidence or new observations. The declinations are given in degrees- and decimals of a degree, a + sign indicating west and a - sign east declination. The epoch is the first day of the year given.

Although the writer has made some attempts to investigate the secular change of the magnetic
1lip,· and of the magnetio horizontal intensity,t neither of these subjects admits of such precision and range as could be given to the discussion of the declination, and for them in particular the use of a circular function in the place of an exponential function is as yet hopeless. The cause is sufficiently

e\'ident; with us, reliable observations for dip hardly date back to the year 1700 on the western coast, while on the eastern coast there are but few observations earlier than the year 1833. Respecting recorded horizontal intensities, there are but a few determinations made in the United States prior to 1830, these and other early observations are, of course, only of a differential eharacter.f
~See preliminary investigation in Coast Survey Report for 1866, Appendices Nos. 32 and 33. t See preliminary investigation in Coast Survey Report for 1861, Appendix No. 2'. t In 18331 Gauss showed how the magnetic force oonld be expressed in absolute mea.snre. In 1836, Profe88Qr Weber applie<l the principle to the small portable instruments, since in UBe; in 1838, he introduced the collimator magnet as proposed by Sir George B. Airy.

PHYSICAL HYDROGRAPHY OF THE GULF OF MAINE, HY JJENRY MITCHELL, ASSISTANT UNITED STATES COAST ANV GEODETW 8URVEY.
BOSTON, Octoba 10, 1878. Sm: In accordance with your instructions, I have attempted a careful study of the data accumulated by the Uoast Survey in the approaches to the New Euglarnl coast, and tl1e following pages are offered as tlJe result, in 1mrt, of this study. Free to draw any inferences J'rom the data that seemed warrantable, I have venture<l upon some inductions, which, if they serve uo other purpose tJian stepping-stones to wider and firmer conclusions, will justify tllemseln's. DEAR GENERAL DESCIUPTTON.

The great bend of the coast bPtween Nova Scotia and New E11gland, which includes the Bay of Fundy, Massachusetts Bay, &c., as subsidiary features, hftS recently recein·d the general designation Gulf of llfa:ine. (See Diagram A.) The seaward limit of this gulf is marked by a chain of shoals, forming, in effN·t, a submerged weir or barrier intersected by several channels which separate and distinguish shallow <listricts known as Nautucket Shoals, George's Bank, Brown Bank, and Seal Island Bank. The channels therusehes ban~ receirnd no distinctive names upon the chart and non(' arc known to be in general or 1111iform use. I haye therefore ado1ited the following as perhaps the most ordinary titles : Great South Cliannel, l;ying between Nantucket Shoals aml George's Ba.nk; Great Ea.~tern Cluomel, lying between tlrn aforesaid hank and Brown Bank; anll Northern Chnnnel, lying between Brown Bank and 8eal Island Bank. Of the two isolated banks, George's is distinguished from Brown as a danger to navigation, the former presenting several spots shallow enough to tetch up vessels of ordinary draught, while the latter has nowhere less than 30 fathoms by chart. After crossing the threshold and entering the gulf, the navigator finds himself" o:tr soundings,'' in the ordinary use of the phrase; for between the chain of shoals a.t the entrance aud the aproning of the coast within, a broad belt or basin of deep water is found. 'Vit.11 a little stretch of the imagination one may conceive of tlte Gulf of ,Maine as a bowl with a break in its rim. I shall use the word .<iill to designate specifically the line of least section along the chain of shoals from Nantucket to Cape Sable, because, as will presently be obvious, the words dam, weir, and bar, as we ordinarily use them, mean too much. I fi1ul the sill, then, lying 011 the arc ut' a circle of 167~ nautical miles radius, with nearly a quadrant of de\·elopment oonrnx toward the ocean. The length of this arc from Nantucket to Cape 8able is 259 nautical mile8, aml upon its site the mean depth is 43 fathoms, giving a section of 406,000,000 of square feet. Along the chor1l of this arc, i.e., in a straight line from Nantucket to Cape Sable, we firnl the distance 2:~5 mileR a.nd the average depth 76 fathoms, giving a section of 651,000,000 square feet, or ahout 50 pet· cent. more water way than is fouml over the sill. The whole area of the gulf within the sill is 36,000 square miles, in mund numberR, of whil'l1 over 101000 square miles have depths exceeding 100 fathoms. The greatest de.pth in the westem portion of the gulf is 180 fathoms, about 46 mile.'l ea.'ltward from Cape Aun, and the greatest depth in the eastern portion of the gulf is 184 fathoms, about 67 miles sonthweRtward from Seal I:slaIHl light. The general average for the entire gulf, including all its navigable hays and angles, may be set down at 75 fathoms at lea.st. Were the level of the sea to fall 43 fathoms, i.e., to the present average lm'el of the sill, the gnlf would hardly lose one.third of its present area. It would still offer an expanse of 24,000 square miles; but instead of 259 miles width of entrance there would be but 50 miles, divided by

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

Brown Bank int-0 two channels; in other words, the sill would emerge throughout some 200 miles of its whole development. There are indications of a state of things not unlike this, in ejfect, as having once existed. No general subsidence need be assumed, but simply the long continuance of familiar agencies, to assist the imagination to the conception of the Gulf of Maine as once a nearly incloscd sea. The dash of the waves and the scour of currents may accomplish as much as this; for "nature doesn't lack time," says the proverb, and here there is uninterrupted exposure in one direction half way round the globe, and great tidal moyements.· The coast of Nova Scotia, especially in the neighborhood of Cape Sable, is ragged with the wrecks of islands and headlands, which the peoIJle of the province call "tlirums"-a wonl which is only proYincial in this happy application. Cape Cod and Nantucket are thrums, and haYe crumbled into the sea to a considerable extent within my own experience as an observer. Mr. H. L. Marimlin's comparison of the several plane-table surveys of the Chatham shore (page 106, Ooast Survey Report, 1873) shows that the beach at this place had fallen back 700 feet since 1847, and Mr: D. Koppmann, engineer of the Massachusetts Harbor Commission, is my authofity for the statement that "during the past year the crest of the glacial bluff on which the light-house stauds bas fallen back 46 feet before tile dash of the sea. In the same way the southeasteru portion of Nantucket Is1aml, which is a glacial deposit of considerable elevatiou, has been encroached npon to such au extent that the site of a row of houses existing at the time of my father's survey, in 1838, at Siasconsett, is now beyond the breaker line, a1thougb a broad beach lies between the present cliff and the sea. On the Cape Sable shore, Chabert's surrny of 1750, compared with the receut survey of Captain Shortlaud, ll. N., shows but little wear: the shores, strewn with rocks, resist the wear of the sea ou this side, so that the enlargement of the gulf is almost entirely to the westward, and is uot likely to be arrested by the uncovering of ledges till the meridian of 70° 30' is reached, which passes within a mile of the Plymouth shore. \Vhen this is accomplished, the entrance to the gulf will be increased about 26 nautical miles, or over 10 per cent. of the Jlresent width. St. George's Ba.uk, the sm11rnit of which is called George's Shoal, is probably a wasted island. It is coYered with pebbles and small stones, except in shallow portions and pot-holes, where the material ground down by the sea has accumulated.. This may fairly be inferred from the official report of Oaptain Hull and the chart of Lieutenant -Wilkes. Capt. Isaac HuU, U.S. N., made note, in 1815 (T), of the assertion of Cape Cod fishermen that "part of the shoal bas been seen quite dry, with gulls sitting upon it," and states that his own shoalest water was three feet after subtracting over seven feet for height of tide. There would 1mem to be no rea8on why the Ra.ml8 should not heap up occasionally so as to emerge at Jow tide ; but the testimony is not direct, and I find much the same report mentioned with cfomredit iu Hol1ingsworth's Nova Scotia, printed in 1786. To what limiting depth the erosive action of waves extends bas never been determined. We hear of sunken vessels broken up during violent gales that had Jain previonsly in twenty fathoms; and Captain Tower, of the Boston Marine Society, is my authority for the statement that a diver of his, on the coast of Maine, having coiletl a chain about his waist for extra weight, ventured 1lowu to the deck of a vessel twenty-three fathoms below the surfacet and there noticed that ropes were swaying to and fro, aud that the eud of his chain was whipped about by the passing swell. In the case before us the tidal currents have been introduced as working forces as soon as the waves have removed the dry laud; this has been noticed on the ea.stern shore of Nantucket particularly, where we find strong currents in localities only recently oocnpied by the sea; and in the great channels 011 either side of George's Bank the currents, although more feeble than those upon the shallow ground, have greater resultant power for the removal of material. There are strong flood and ebb streams over George's Bank, but these are nearly in equilibrio so that the shoal is no doubt maintained rather than reduced by their action. It was during the physical survey of New York Harbor in 1859 that it first occurred to me that I could treat the hourly current observations of a tidal day as simultaneous forces, where their in:fluence upon a sandy bottom was in question,
·In a previous pa11er, entitled "Notes concerning tb6 all6ged chaugeti in the relativ6 elevatiODB of land and l!tla," 6Vid6UC6 is produced to show that the shores of the Gulf of Maine have undergone no V6rtical change since the voyage of Champlain in 1606.

and ti.tis moue uf trt·atr11cut suun rcyealed the causes of ,-,Iioals of light sand iu the midst of strong tides. It will be seen, from the tables that I shall presently refer to, tLat the currents oYer George's, workecl up by eornpo.~itfon of forces, give but a small and doubtful resultaut. The summit of this shoal is a quicksand, llC\'er at rc1;t but BC\'Cr escaviug, and this condition of wixtable equilibrium must continue till the u11equal wear of the shores has materially altered the tidal fluxes. The narrowest section at the entrance to the gulf is found between Cape Cod (just hclow Highland Lights) a1ul :::le:il lflla11d, Norn Scotia, where the distance iR about 198 miles. Here the average depth is 90 fathoms (double the average depth upon the Sill), and the section is (l;J0,000,000 square feet. As compared with the chord of the circular Sill, before described, the variatioll of de11th is found to be about iu the inverse ratio of the width, and the section, therefore, very nearly constant. The agreement between these two sections, as regards area, or the slight decline which is in about the right proportion to tidal volume, might, in the absence of other facts, seem to indicafo that the opening was the result of scour, in the same sense that we should speak of the section of au inlet through an alluvial coast; but when we come to the Sill and find the section more than 50 per cent. less, the semblance ceases. A bar at a river's mouth or at an inlet through the littoral cordon, presents, in plan, somethiug very like what we have here, but not in elemtion, for the bar cannot have less section than the river or inlet itself, under ordinary circumstances.
TIDES AND TIDAL CURRENTS.

The soundings over this region of our coast approaches were completed a few JCan; ago, and made it possible to compute the area of entrance section and tl1e average rate at which the currents should flow in order to fill and drain the great tides obsen-ed within. This computation did not enable us to determiue tlie directions of the currents, except in a general way, a11d left UR altogether in donut as to the distribution of velocities. It was evident that the rate could not be uniform for the whole width of the entrance, or the time of turning from ebb to flood everywhere the same, but whPther the current should flow more or less rapidly in deep than in shallow portions could not be foreseen. In rivers where the bed is alhwial, the thread of greatest velocity is coincident with the track of greatest depth, at least in straight sections; at the bars of tidal rivers and inlets the same is true, especial!~· if we consider both flood and ebb as joint agents; but in the case before us we had from popnlar report and from such obsen·ations as had heen made upon George's Shoal by Ilull, ·wilkes, and Howell, an intimation that the usual rules for bars would not apply, and this induced you to issue instructions to Master Robert Platt, of the Coast Sun·c;y schooner Drift, to make obserYations all along the line of least section. These current observations, made with faithfulness and skill, have widened our knowledge of the peculiar tides of this section of the country and induced this report, which is designed to bring into aceord and unite into one chain the various observations aml studies that have been made in this section since 1854. The tides of this region are peculiar in the respects that they present an abrupt departure from the general rule for tre tide on this side of the Atlantic and are accompanied by strong tidal currents which often sweep vessels, especially those under sail, out of their reckoning. These peculiarities have been long known among seafaring men in a general wa.y, but to Prof. A. D. Ba.che, our former Superintendent, belongis the credit of having first made them the subject of scientific inquiry, while it has remained for you to bring this inquiry to a practical focus by supplementing the coastwise observations of Professor Bache by others wide out at sea directly in the track of the mariner. There is a popular rule among our coasters and fisl1ermcn which runs thus: "To tlie ,wuthward of Na.ntucket southeast moon makes high ivater; to the 1wrthward of Nantucket south moon make.~ it." It would be nearly as correct to say, al01ig tlte oeeau frontage of the American coast, from the straits of Belle Isle to the strait& of Florida, southeast moon makes high water, except in the Gulf of Maine, where "south moon maku it:" for leaving out the stations between Cape Sahlt\ and Nantucket, it will be seen from the tide tables that the characteristic lunar interyaJ is seven and a half hours from York Point, Labrador, to Cape Canaveral, iI1 Flori(Ia.· ·The Bermuda. all.d-Bahama. outer islands fall under this rule n~arly, whff~the Pla.centi;-cii~tM~t of N0wfoumllan·l

l'erlmps I can best introduce the details of the nodal phenomena (adopting I'rofesso1· Pcirce'l:l term) by refeni11g first to tlie practical inquiries connected with the pr~ject for the coustruction of the Cape Cod Canal, which was designed to connect Buzzards' Bay (visitetl by the ocean thlc) with Cape Cod Baj· (visited by the gulf tide). l<'ig. 3, Diab'Tam B, is a plotting of the tidal curves of August 14, 18HO, as actually observed at gauges separated u.y the seven miles of isthmus tha.t lie hetwee11 the two bays.t The t.irle of Oape Uod Bay, which is eharacforistie of the Gulf of Maine, has an average range of !).17 f(,-et, aud its high water follows the moon's transit at an inter\·al of llh 15111, or precedes the 11ext transit u,y 1h 9m; while the tide of Buzzards' Bay, representing the tide of our southern coast, has an average range of 4.11 feet, aud follows the transit at an intern1.l of 711 52"', or precedes the next transit 4i. 32m. In tlle diagram offered here, a, large diurual inequality g"ives to the morning tide a r-.111ge below, and to tlle afternoon tide a range above the average. It presents very well, however, the variations of slope likely to occur in the canal. At 3i o'clock in the morning, for instance, Buz.

zards' Bay was uearly 5 fot't ahove Uape Uod Bay, while six hours later a reverse slopP of somethi11g o\·er G feet obtained. \\"p h:we no 1lifficnlty i11 concei\·inµ; of slopes like thesP in a canal, au<l as eaRily }H'P<lict the currents they would e11gemler under tlH· local action of gr:wity, bnt the more ditlicult c011c·.pptio11 to \Yhich we now turn is that of slopes in the open ocean, the ejfcct rather tlmn tlle cause of ltorizolltal 111oveme.nts. Upon JJiagr:uu U are plotterl tidm; olJRervf'd upou the outside of Nantucket Island Septernher 24, 185.t. It will be obt'ervcd that the Smith's Point and Great Point tidal cmTes are small but near!~- symmetrical, an<l differ in time, like those at either end of the caual-onl.Y in grnat.er degre(', for here the~- are fonr or five hour" apart. 'l'hey represent, respectin~ly, tile ocPan awl gnlf tides ah110'4t u11affecteu hy each other. As we pass on to Siai'\conset a111l \Yewt'eder we ti111l the tides m nd1 red11ct>d and distorted, but still distinguishable as belonging to ditien·nt sy'4tt'111s. The cmTc.s irllich tlle plottt><l ti meil and heights reveal are still about four hours apart from centt'r to ceuter. 111 thh; short dii:;tauce from Siascouset to \Veweeder, less than 7 miles, we\ firnl differeuce8 of lt>Y<·l of :1 foot autl a half or two feet. A slope of three incheR to the mile, which we lmn~ !Jere in the ope11 ocea11, is donblC\ as great ai:; t11at of the Mississippi River 400 mill's a hon; it" mouth i11 gre<lt floods. The surface of the ocean is warped, uot for a single instaut, a;< in tlm passage of wind waye, but for hours together. Its surface slowly tilts up aull down ou either side of a nodal li11e enw_y six hours. The i'at11e two tides make a node i11 the Vineyard Sound along a line wl1iclt rm18 nerosR from Falmouth to \Yest Chop. ilPre we find within lialf a mile titles of Reniral hours' variati011 of time, and occat'ionally (precisely on the node) we have four distinct high waters in a day, so nearly equal that one camiot Ray within four hom·R at what time it is high-water or low-water. The coaster arridng from tlrn Sonth wonld claim tlrnt the i;;well wbich occuri;; with the moou in the southeast i;; reall~' higll-watt>r, ,1-hile tlie "Dowueaster" would claim the swell occurring four hours later as tl1t· genniue tide. Upon Diagram B, Figs. 1 arnl 2, will be found simultaneously observed tides of N o-11mu':da1Hl, I<'almonth arnl M011omoy, tlie fir"t and last representing, respectin1ly, the ocean and gnlf tides, while Falmouth reprcse11tK th« nodal fluotnation betweeu them. Two sets are gh-eu to show how the two tidal s~·stcms affoct each other, aucl how the fluctuations at the node altematel~· hetray the Jlresencc of the g;re~r ti<le, first 011 one side then 011 the other. It is m'ident that the two elPmentary tides am no~uliject to the same law of i?wqualities, but this may be due largel_y to tlte obstructions tlte~· i.Yiclmtlly meet. The diurual and semi-diurnal tides, for i1rntauce, luwi11g different massPR arnl mm·ing at. different rates, would give rise to different effects due to obstruction. I find in attempting to construct the tide near the node out of multiples of the other two superimposed that there i" always n residual, regularly recurring but not to be accounted for. The very fact that the cun·es of rise aud fall, as they near the node, lose their synm1etry show,; that each before merging- into the other has lost its primal elli11tical form, for no combination of elli11tical figures would destroy the symmetry of the resultant. As the point of ohservatiou recedes from tlie node, the tidal curve shows lei:;s and less trace of transition, although the distortion of figure may sometimes be traced as far as Monomoy in one direction, an<l Block Island in the other. Let us now turn from the phenomena exl1ibited at the western extremity of the nodal arc, and inquire wltat takes place at Cape Sable, to which this arc extends. In the table which follow" (No. 2), and its illustratirn diagram (D), the results of recent observations made by l\fr. E. H. Lincoln and myself will be found. The ol~ject of our visit to Noya Scotia was to ascertai11 wltetl1t·r the point wbere the arc of least section runs upon the coast is the same at which the sltift of esta,blishment is initiated, and whether at this place the same warps of the ocean's snrface occur that we bad found at Nantucket. The inquiry involved much less difficulty tlrn11 was anticipated, because remarkably quiet weather had so stilled the sea that we were able to place g-auges in situations exposed to the ocean aud beyoml the suspicion of local inthieuces. A tisl1erma11, who had been cruising off tlw i'd'1pe the day previous to our occupation of the stations at Cape Sable Island, told us that he Jrn<l distinctly seen objects upon the bottom in 17 fatho111s of water, the surface of the sea was so uuruttled !

It will be seen at once, on inspecting the table, that the heights observeW-t Port La Tour and Cat Point, to tbe eastward of Cape Sable, are almost identical, or correspoud very nearly with Donald, 011 tlte east side of Cape Sahle Island; hut in passing the point of the cape a ''ery decided increase of range aucl a sharp change of lnnar interval present themselves. Simultaneous observations made every 15 minutes at Donald, on the ea!'teru, and Cla1·k, on the western side of Cape Sable Island, show a change in the position of the tidal curve of 36 minutes from center to center. This shift of time, which is effected in less than miles, measured coastwise, is greater than can lie found going eastward the whole length of Nova Scotia bordering upon the ocean. The curve for Donald, given npon our Diagram D, will answer pretty well for ernry salient upon the coast for 300 miles to the eastward-in the same way that the similar tide of Smith's Point, Nantucket, will answer for the southern shorns of Martha's VineyarLl and J,ong Island. The shift of time hetween Donald and Clark is 10 minutes to the mile, and the increase of range is 8 per cent. (compounding) to the mile. 'l'he new tide, rapidly evolving itself as it passes into the gulf, goes on shifting its time as it proceeds, but at a diminished rate. On reaching Seal Island it has fallen back 6 minutes to the mile, and increases its range 3 per cent. Beyond this, although it l>ecomes in the Bay of Fundy the higl1est tide in the world, it lOBeS only 1 minute to the mile, and acqnireH itH gTPat mnge gradually. It never again warps the ocean's surface to the extent that it does at tlle place of its hirth. · It will he seen from a little closer examination of the table (No. 2) that about the time of tra.nsit the ocean is level at Cape Sable, the heights being the same at Donald and Clark ; bat a half an hour later the warp amounts to 0.3, and goes on increasing tlll at the fourth hour the sea, which is nearly lm·el in the approach from the eastward, makes a dip of over a foot between these two stations. After this the slope declines till at the sixth hour level is again restored. Still later the

.

3z

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

181

ocean tilts the other way, and the warp at the ninth hour amountfl to a foot and a half, returning again to a level at the next tranRit. The surface le-ml is restored at two periods 6 lunar hours apart at elevations of+ 1.81 feet, and-1. 76 feet respecth'ely as measured from the meau ocean level; but at the time of greatest warp the sea at Donald (where the break in the sea level first occurs) is at the ocean level or near it. Although the tidal curves are not distorted at the Cape Sable shifting point, they warp the ocean even more than at Nantucket. Three inches to the mile was stated as a fair maximum at Nantucket, but at Cape Sable it cannot be estimated at lesis than 5 inches, which is greater than the slope of the Mississippi River 1,000 miles from its mouth during floods. These slopes are greater than will be found at the entrance to any of our commercial harbors, but they do not give rise to currents of the same order as those excited by the s!Opes in our harbor channels. Iu the entrances to our smaller J1arbors ~md iulets, we observe that flood current begins as soon as the surface of the ocean rises above that of the basin within, and ebb current begins under the reverse relations of surfaces, these movements being due to the direct local action of gramity. But in the ocean the horizontal motion is independent of the slope in the surface. Indeed, it is the slope which is dependent upon the pushing in or withdrawal of the water; as a matter of fact, both flood and ebb are running up hill at opposite ends of their courses, ant! there exchange names.

I confess to a very great surprise many years ago, wheu I couducte<l the tidal and current observations of the Vineyard Sound, to find that the horizontal motion was about as often opposed to the direction of the slope as in accord. Off West Cho1l, at the junction of Nantucket and Vine-

182

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

yard Sounds, it tnrued out that t.he currents were most rapid near the time of restoration of level between tlw two 80llrnls, an<l slack-water occurn·d near the time of gTeatest differeuce of lcn~l. Over the great llO(l~tl arc, at the entrance to the Gulf of Maine, to wllicl! I have called your atteution, the saml' appears to be true; the currents are most active when tlw sea is nearly level, and tltc water ii; runniug up hill for three hours of each tide. Slack-water ocem·s when the ocean is lying at or near its greatest slopt"-as when om~ swings a pendulum tl!e p;reatest velocity is attained when tlte path of tl!e boll is horizontal, and this bob comes to rest at the rnomeut when at its highest poiut. In Captain Platt'R instructio1l8, the geographical positions he was required to occupy were stated, and these were :,;o nearly attained t1rnt liis eight stations between Nantneket an<l Ca1w Srthle fell Yers near the <lt·:,;imble points in the arc of least section as we ha·e finally th:_awn it. There i" coJJsi1lerahk tlitforence of merit among hi:s ohi;ervatious, because of varying weather, an<l tl1e Tal>lc 5, compiled from his work at station 5, on the eastern slope of George'R Bank: is 11ot o1fored as an anrage s1wcimeu, but as an ill11stratio11 of the varying courses and velocities of the current under tlw bl'St circmn8tances. 'l'lie cune11tR. prove to be simply tidal, there being no indication of any constant stream. Takiug thP whole 8el'ies together, it appe£trs proba,ble that ebb aud flood currents are exactl;y ec1m1l, altltongh in applyiug factors deri\'Cd from comparative ranges of the ti<le, to corTect tlw Yelocities of different da.rs or half da;ys, an cqualit;y of the outflows and inflows is not actuall;y reached. By plotting the rise at North IlaYcn for every half l10ur, with the Yelocity olmerved at. tlw station of thC' 8am<· tlate, arnl 1fotermining the tlifference iu time of the centers of the two curves, it has been pm;sible to make use of every oliserYation in determining the epochs of the current. In the following table (No. 4) these difte.renccs of time are furnished together with tlic cm1seqnent establishments given by appl~'i11g these differences to the means of the whole tidaJ series at North Ilaven.

Comparing this table (No. 4) with No. 1, it will be seen that the current runs into the gulf, over our great arc, until bigl1 water l1as occurred in every part of the basin. There are differences of time both among the tidal and the current stations, but these cannot be, in the main, attributed to 1lcla;y in tl1e transmission. The oce.an at our arc is in motion from surface to bottom, antl in the communication of this impulse through the deep gulf there is {and should be, I submit) no sensible loss of time. The wbole scheme of cotidal liues devised for this section by Professor Bache, after the plan of Dr. Whewcll, is open to the objection that the loss of time is too great at the shifting places for any possible effect of friction. It now appears that an impulse observe<l at one of our

current stations on our nodal arc is almost iu1111ediately followe1l hy a Yertieal d1a11ge upon the mm;t distant sl1ore, as if the horizontal motion were the .fi1rce aml the Ye1tical titl(· the i11111wdiate mechanfoal e.fj'eet producNl through an inelastic medium. The current ol1sene<l is a proximate cause of the lift of water beyond, but only in the sense that an iutermediate wlieel i11 a trni11 is the cause of motion beyond. Of course it is not denied that the horizontal motion is the dkd of graYity in that wider scuse that includes a wider region of unexplored ocean. lu Table No. 5, which follows, specimens of the tides at the wc;.;tem t·xtrcmity of our 11udal arc are furnished, while in Table No. u a generalization for characteristic stations iu tlie gulf is attemptetl.

\Vith the help of the foregoiug tables, it is now proposed to describe the phenomena hour h~· hour, presuming that the agTeement in the testimon~· gives tl1e results for certain hours a degree of certainty, while the disagreements do not indicate errors of obser\'"ation so much as the impoRsibility of reducing oh~rvatiom; of different dates to the same terms. The ltoman 11umeml1' will be used to indicate lunar hours after transit, and comments upon thPm will cover the halt' honr before and after each hour, and point out the distinctive feature8. In mder to conshlcr first the direct action of the flood stream, we shall begin our descriptions with the eighth hour after the transit of the moon when the gulf is nearly level, and when the ocean's surface is at the same height as that of the gnlt: VJ1111 · This hour of general restoration of level corresponds nearly with that of g-retttcst horizontal movement across the 11odal arc. At all our stations the strength of the flood current now prevails, and a great mass of water is being pushed into the gulf through the deep channels and over the shoals. lXh, The effect of the great influx, which has scarcely abated, is observable in the rapid rise along the coast of Maine and in the Bay of Fundy, while at and beyoud tlic nodal arc thP ticlfl of the ocean is falling. 'l'he dip of tlrn entire Gulf iR seaward exce11t in the immediate neighborhood of Nantucket. Tile greatest slope is at Cape Sable, where it is 5 inches to the mile, althoug·h the general slope from the shore of Maine to the nodal arc is only 0.15 of an inch to the mile· This slope is very remarkably sustained, as we shall see, and it is difficult to conceirn of a curre11t steallily moving up hill, except we give it priority and make it the cause of the slope. Xh, The conditions continue much the same as at IX11· The Minas Basin is the highest place, and Nantucket the lowest, while North Haven, the intermediate station, ha8 an iuterrnediate height; but still the current runs up the great eastern and northern channels, althuug-h His falling off in strength and a reaction is foreshadowed.. The slope at Cape Sable is ~ inches t-0 the mile, as we approach Yarmouth 11:, while in the Bay of Fundy it is leRB than 1 ineh to the mile.

it would appear that the birth of the new tide is attended by a remarkable warp of the ocean at the node. There is probably no parallel instance in the rest of the ocean world. Xlh, The Gulf of .Maine lies at its greatest elevation. It is high tide along the entire shore of Maine and in the Bay of Fundy. The reaction takes place and the current along the nodal arc reverses. The slope from the Minas Basin to the ocean reaches 20 feet, which, following the line of greatest depth, represents 1 inch to the mile; but at Cape Sable we have still l~ inches, and at Nantucket over 2 inches to the mile. It may ~e concluded, then, that slack current occurs at the time when the final lift of the gulf has been accomplished. Oh, As the moo11 crosses the meridian of North Haven the entire Gulf is falling, from the head of the Bay of Fundy, where the water stands at an elevation of 1G to 20 feet above the mean level of the ocean, to the nodal arc, where the surface is 1 foot below the mean level (at Nantucket), or 2 feet below at Cape Sable. The dip of the surface of the gulf is great and everywhere seaward, lmt not at a uniform slope. The current is ebb, however, along the entire length of the nodal are. P. It is low-water, or nearly so, in the ocean outside of the Gulf of Maine, an<l the surface of the sea at the nodal arc to 3 feet below mean sea level, while the Bay of Fundy is still much elevated, and the surface along the shore of Maine slightly above mean sea-level. The slope is still iu the same direction (seaward), but is rapidly lessening, while the ebb current is fairly in train and everywhere augmenting. Ilh, The general level of the gulf· is being restored, and the ebb current is at its greatest rate of flow nearly all along the nodal arc. The current is opposed to the slope of the ocean outside of the gulf, and we have a repetition, in the opposite sense, of the phenomena observed at VIII1'. Illh, Tl1e tiue i8 falling over the whole gulf, while the dip of the snrfaee is toward the Bay of I?undy, at the head of which the greatest depressiou appears. The ebb current is losing strength in the eastern half of the gulf, where the slope having a reverse direction is greatest, but is still strong in the easternmost portion, which is approaching a level. IVIt. The slope is northward over tlle entire gulf, and ebb everywhere prevails, although the general Im-el of the open portion of the gulf is about 6 feet below that of the sea, and the Minas Basin at least 14 feet below. The maximum slope at Cape Sable is approaching, and the current of the northern channel is slacking up. Vb, The gulf has sunk to its lowest average. It is low-water along the coast of Maine, and it is nearly low-water in the Bay of Fundy. The nortliward slope is a1111roaching its maximum, and tlie current of tlie eastern section of the gulf turus from ehb to flood. At this rnomeut the northward slope on the eastern shore of Nantucket is 2.3 inches to the mile, with a slight ebb current in the Great South Channel in a direction opposed to this slope-i. e., up-hill. At Cape Sable we have also a northward slope of 2.8 inches to the mile, but rapidly declining. But the general slope from the ocean to the coast of Maine is less than 0.5 inch to the mile, and in tlie open portion of the ]fay of Fundy not above 1 inch. Ilere again we have a repetition of the comlitions observed at Xlh, The outward movement due to the reaction of the tide is unable longer to sustain the slope, and a reversion takes place. . VP'. The current is running flood all over our field of observation, in the direction of the slope generally, although the level is restored at Cape Sable and along the coa8t of Nova Scotia for some distance northward. In the Northern Channel the flood current has reached its first quarter, and is running nearly as fast along its level course as it is destined to do at its strength. The tide is everywhere rising, from t~e ocean to the head of the Bay of Fundy. On the eastern shore of Nantucket the slope northward has reached a maximum of nearly 3 inches to the mile, and the current in the Great South Channel has reversed its course from ebb to flood. It would appear that tlie epoch of greatest difference of level and that of slack-water correspond on either side of the entrance to the gulf. So that by careful tidal obRervations on shore the tables for mariners could be reduced to great accuracy. VIIh. The ocean is rising very slowly and the Bay of Fundy rapidly. The slope is northward and toward the Bay of Fundy, except that Cape Sable is slightly above the stations on either side. The flood current is at its first quarter in the Southern Channel, and near its maximum in the Northern Channel.

To avojd confusion uo comments have been made upon the tilt in an east a,lHl west direction, but such tilting goes on, as may be seen from com1)aring Nantucket and Cap<; Sable heights. The heights at these two extremities of the nodal arc are equal at about V and at X hours, and correspond with the mean ocean level very nearl:f. Tliese times correspond witli slack-water on George's Shoal, and with the greatei,;t difference of level on a line transverse to the chord of the nodal arc. The hours of greatest difference of height between Cape Sable and Nantucket, YIII1 and II~, correspond nearly with a restoration of level in the transrnrse direction. From Y to XJ 1 during which the slope is westerly, the currents incline to draw round more easterly in direction, or to run more up-hill. From XI round to V, during which the slope is easterly, the ehb current inclines to :tlow more and more westerly. Here again we find the current disposed to take a course most opposed to the slope, as if the latter was the product of its push toward the shore. · I have referred to the pendulum as an illustration of the phenomena presented in the Gulf of :Maine, because the horizontal motion at our sm, like that of the p0ndulum at the lowest point of its course, is the proximate cause of the rise of the tide, first upon oue side, then UJJOn the otller· Perhaps a happier illustration would be that of a bent tube or hrverted siphon, whose arms are of Yery unequal size aud of unequal inclination to the vertical. In such an instrument the oscillations of a fiuitl wouhl be of very unequal range if we compared the rt>snlt;; in Hie two arms. The great tide of the Ba,y of I<'undy is the result of a movement of the ocean in this direction whid1 forces a vast body of water into a coatrncting flume. Without going behind actual observations, howeve1·, for antecedent causes, I ai;sume that our current ohsern1tions represent the mo,·ement of the ocean just mentioned, which movement is probably a rocking motion inimarily, as I>rofessor Ferrel has ably represented.* Following up this idea, I have grouped together the obserrntions at the three central stations on our great nodal arc, and then compared them, hour by 110ur, with the rates of rise or fall of tide on the coast of Maine. The first attempt was made with the velocities just as obserrnd, ignoring the variations of direction, but this was evident!;;· wrotJg. Next, the forces were decomposed, and those normal to the arc selected. These components should represent filling or draining over a sill, but the residual from the comparison with the tide was still too large. Lastly, a comparison was made between the squares of the velocities and the vertical changes on the shore, whieh seemed to answer very well, as will be seen from the table helow (No. 7) in which the three trials are numerically stated. It would seem that the rise on the shore is the result of impact, in the most general sense, and the fall the reaction, if we can regard the observed velocities as increments of force; but if it were possible to determine the flgure of the tidal prism from hour to liom in the gulf, the sum of the components of aJl the stations, according to the second trial mentioned above, would of course give the true measure for com1)arison, since it would represent actual filling or draining. If it be granted that the horizontal movements of the deep sea are nearly synchronous, as our observations indicate, for many hundred miles, what explanation 1vithin the limits of obseri1t1tion can be offered for the sudden change of time in the vertical tide at the thresl1hold of the Gulf of Maine f @bservations made by the British .Admiralty eastward of Cape Sable, and those made by myself southward of Long Island, show that the flood movement for the tide of the outside coast is from northeast to southwest, and the ebb movement nearly the reverse of this. To this fiood movement the Gulf of Maine is a dead angle, lmt for the return movement this gulf it> a pocket into which the waters are cr~ed, and by virtue of their vis viva piled up in the Bay of Fundy. If we draw a chord line from a point near Cape Cana\"eral, in .l!'lorida, to Cape Hatteras, this line produced will be the chord of the great bend between Cape Hatteras and Nantucket, but be,roud this tlw same .straight line p1·oduced faJls in with the major axis of the Gulf of Maiue, exclndJug :Xorn Scotia as salient to the general bend of the coast, and making it an abrupt obstrnction to any coastwisc mo\"ement from the southward. This, I submit, as a possible solution of the problem of the peculiar tides of this section. The tide of the Bay of Fundy and the Gulf of l\Iaiue geuerally is a product of the rt',fiex of obstruction in the path of the oceanic ehb tide. If the tlux and reflux of the ooean causing the tide is a compound rocking motion, the heights would in it meas1m> depend n1>0n tbe angle of impact, so that the range would be small when the directfon of the motion is diagonal to the trend of the coast, and greatest when most direct.

NoTE.-ln this tabl~ the signs + and - are used to distinguish flood from ebb, and tho rising from the falling tid6. The changM in the direction from hour to hour on ehb or flood hsve been ignored, except in computing the elements of column "i," where the components in the dirooHou of' the resultants offtood and ebb are g1ven.

In the tides at the Placentia district of Newfoundland which jnts out into the sea, traces are found of the same peculiarities that we have observed on the western coast of Cape Sable. I am not at all tenacious of this theory of the case, but I present it as the stepping-stone reached induct. ively from the data thus far collected, which, as before stated, I must regard as covering effects with their proximate eauses only. There is one important test which the above theory does not answer to, and this I can best represent in connection, if not in contrast, with the nodal hypothesis of Professor Peirce upon · which my description of the ti des has been based as stated at the outset. It is premised in the nodal hypothesis that the depth and section in the North Atlantic is sufficient for the transmission of a body of water adequate to the creation of oscillations of very great extent, so that the tide of the oceanic basin is not broken up into numerous ~parate undulations; but where great bays or avenues extend into the continent nudes should ol!Cur; or if the pathway is shallow the tide becomes a progressive wave. In the case of the Gulf of Maine, its form, extent, and depth make a node necessary, and within it ap}Jears the reciprocal or complement of the ocean tide, speaking in the most general sense. In tbe physical scheme proposed by myself, if the tide of the Gulf of Maine were due to the saliency of the Nova Scotian peninsula which arrests the recoil of the ocean tide, the duration of the ri8e in this gulf should correspond with the durations of the fall elsewhere, which 1 am satisfied is not the case in a majority of instances offered in the comparison I have instituted between our permanent stations at Old Point Comfort and North Haven. Of course it was not expected that the diurnal inequality of one tide would reverse that of the other, except iu the most gene.ral way, because in my hypothesis the tide of tbe gulf was in a measure a mixture of the direct and the return,

movement, all(l also because this inequality is prone to change iu magnitude with obstructions which produce unlike effects upon waves of different duration and magnitude; but at periods when the diurnal inequalities of interval were large for both the ocean and the gulf tides, I found them of tbe same sign usually, insteatl of being reven;ed as my theory would demand. Presenting this objection also to ProfP8s,1r Peirce's explanation of the case, it was met by the statement that tlie diurnal aml semi-diurnal tides heing oRcillations of different length could not make their nodes at the same point, so that the diurnal inequalities would not be reversed, but only greatly com11licated, as they certainly are.

REPORT. OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

From the foregoing tables (8 and 9), it will be seen that the velocities increase from station to station as the deptlts diminish, but not in full ratio, while the resultants for a tidal day are less clependent upon velocity and 1lepth than upon the relative directions of ebb and flood. Tile high velocity over (}eorge's Bank is the result of a diminution of section, but the presence of this bank as an antecedent obstruction is seen to be the cause of a retardation if we compare volumes. It is evident that tlte resultaut at some point between the meridians passing through Stations 3 and 4 must be nearly zero. This point probably lies on the summit of George's Shoal, and would be a zero point if no bank or shoal existed, being simply that point in the common path of ebb and flood when these streams are equal and opposite. This shoal is probably prevented from rising to the surface by the variatiou of section induced by tile ri:se and fall of the tides, which throw corrcspundiug stagei> of eub aml flood ont of balance above a certain plane, as we uotice at the mouths of sandy harbors which would Jut\"!' 110 outlets if it were not Uiat the ,-olumes passiug in and out with the title follow a law at variance with that of the rise aucl fall, so that the maximum volume of outflow on the ebb (for instance) occurs at a lower stage (when there is less section) than that of the correspomliug influx, mid tlierefore has greater scouring powers. The t('!Hleney of a l'hoal Rituated at the equilibrium point of cmn-erging currents to become steeper, may be likened to the disposition of a hill upon the laud to become steeper under the reverse action of the rain, which abrades the side:s more than the top. 111 the first ca:se the shoal increases its slope twofold by adding to the top what is robbed from the flank; while in the other case the hill, although growing st-0eper, is decliuing in height, principally by tlle tilling up of the valley. In the first case the ocean bed is being thrown out of level; in the other the surface of the contiurnt is being planed down to uniformity. Very respectfully submitted. HENHY ~ITCIIBLL, As.~istant U.

REPORT ON THE PREPARATION OF STANDAJW TOPOGRAPHICAL DHA\YlKUS, BY EDWIN HERGESHElMEH, ASSISTANT COAST AND GEODETIC sntYEY.
(Refer to pp. 71 aml 72 of this Yolurne.)

OFFICE OF THE U:KITED STATES Co.A.ST AND GEODETHJ SURVEY,

Washington, July 1, 1879. Sm: In the preparation of to11ographical drawings to be used as guides for inking the original plane-table sheets of the Coast and Geodetic Suney, selection was first matle of snch features, natural and artificial, as are most prevalent on our cuasts. The first snl!icct was the representation of closely-built cities, comprising large public buildings, warehouses, &c., aml suburban villas and grounds of the first class. :Xewport, RI., was selected for this purpose, wheni it was found desirable to disconti11ue the inking of large buildings in full black, and to confine the black to the exterior, representing the outer walls, and to tint the interior by fine lines closel,y rnled. Carriage-ways and walks of Yilla or public g-romtds are here represented in full light line, instead of the broken line formerly used. Fresh marsl1 is also reJlresented in a styJe different from that heretofore in use. Its representation had preYionsly been by irregularlJ· distrilmtetl tufts of grass, underliued h.r free hand with water lines, which, drawn with taRte, is perhaps the most artistic representation of the feature; btit wllich is seldom represented the same by any two persons. It was therefore thought best to introduce a style that could be definitely describml and re(1uired. J<'or this purpose, lines of the same strength and the same distance apart as those of the salt marsl1 are ruled and irregularly broken, then interlined antl tufted by free hand with light sllort lines grouped irregularly, as shown iu the first of the series of sketd1es accompan;ying this paper. For the representation of a town sparsely settled, Brunswick, Ga., is gh·cn, on which saJt marsh, pine woods, ditches, fences, undefined roads, and wagon tracks are shown. For the represention of railroalls, canals, iron bridges, bold faces of rock, mid-river drift, waterworn rocks, and distribution of mixed woods over close hill curyes, the vicinity of Harper's l·'erry is given. Here is illustrated the strengthening of the 100-feet hill cnrn~s for tl1e more ready readiug of the heights of hills. For the representation of heavy oak timber, reclaimed marsh and orchards, a part of the Nmr ,Jersey shom of the Delaware Hiver is given. For the representation of rice, and the dikes and ditches incident to its cultivation, a selection from Santee Hiver is gi,·en. I<'or the representation of eroded drift banks with bowlders set free, and scrub deciduous wooilR, the western part of Martha's Vineyard, including Gay Head, is given. For the representation of the rocky shores and intermediate sand and shingle beaches, beaches above high water and eroded earth banks, characteristic of the coast of New England, roads, fences, residences, outhouses, shade trees on the lines of roads, and the shading of low hills by normals, the extreme entl of Nahant is given. For the representation of a sandy beach, with low dunes, fresh-water ponds, meadow grass, sage-brush, fresh marsh, and eroded gulleys (arroyas), a selection from the >icinity of San Luis Obispo was made. Samples not yet engra,·ed ha-.e also been drawn for various characters of eroded awl fractured granite rocks, as shown at Mount Desert Island; hard ernptiYe rocks, as 11howu :it Cape Dir-mpPQintment, Oregon, and eroded sedimentary forms at Arlington, Va.

ON THE RECONSTR1'CTION OF THE DIVIDINf; EKGIKE OF THE COAST AND GEODETIC SERVl:Y. A REPORT TO THE ASSISTANT 1N CHARGE OF THE OFFICE, BY G. N. SAEGMULLEH, CHIEF MECHANICIAN.
(Ap11endix No. 12. Coast awl (foo1letic i'lnn-cy l{cport for 1879.)

OCTOBER 20, 1880. Srn: I have the honor to submit the following re1)ort on the present con<litiou of the Coast imrvey diYiding engine. The character of tlw graduations produced by the engine before its reconstruction proved to bli unsatisfactory, owing to several causes which I pointed out to yon in a former report,, which resulted in the old apparatus for tracing the lines being replaced hy a new one of improved design and more substantial construction. It was necessar;r, before attempting to correct the errors of the circle itself, to remove any possible errors arising from an instability of the tracing apparatus. Although the performance of the engine was greatly improved after the new apparatus had been attached, yet large errors still existed, and, what was worse, they did not remain constant on the same parts of the circle, showing that the machine was not true t-0 itself. Unless the machine could be brought to do the same work over and over again, tlms making the same corrections necessary, it was of no use to attempt to correct these errors. A careful examination led to the belief that the unsteadiness of the machine was caused by the imperfection of the axis. This axis, being a hollow truncated cone of soft brass, on the upper and lower ends of which two steel rings, forming the bearings, are shrunk, fits into a socket of red metal. The expansion of these metals being different, the axis could not be made to work in the same way at different temperatures. It was found that by an increase of temperature the axis would turn· too easily. This had to be corrected by lowering the axis in its socket by means of a set-screw at the lower end. A decrease in temperature, again, would make it turn so hard that it could only be movetl by exerting great pressure, therefore the axis bad to be screwed up again to make it turn easier. It is of the greatest importance tbat the axil'! should never be disturbed by means of the setscrmY at tl1e bottom, for when the circle is thus raised or lowered tlie screw will have a different bearing in the threads of the limb, thus requiring a re-examination of the table of errors. The only remedy for this defect was to have the dividing room kept at an equal temperature. I had also found that my presence for a oonsiderable time at one side of the circle (the t.emperature of the room then being about 62° F.) caused it to expand, and by placing two micwmeter

microscoi)es at opposite parts of the circle, 1 actually measured that one 8emicircle exc\·(·dt·d tl11· other by nearly four seconds, having become warmer by 20 F. It was therefore decided to haYe the temperature kept steady at 98° F. ~e\.8 the room wa"' small this was easily effected by two gas-burners. After this I found that the steadiness of th1· circle-or its axis-in relation to fixed microscopes left nothing to he desired. The examination of the circle could uow be proceeded with, and it was decided first to examine the origfoal graduation. If this had been found satisfactory, it would have been very easy to find tlie errors iu tllc· threads of tlie circle. It was, however, soon apparent that tlie circle must haYe suffered a change, as the micro1;copes did not remain in focus when used on different Jrnrts of the circle. This defect could 11ot be remedied, and an exami11ation of the graduation under such conditions could have but little weight. I decided then to make an entire!~· new "original" graduation. Before doing this that part of the limb which was to receive the dfrision was turned off by revolving the circle in its socket, which assured me that the plane of the graduation was at right angles to the axis. The definition of the microscopes now set to an~· part of the circle was equally good all around. I long ago came to the conclusion that the surest and most expedititJ!lls way of producing; au original graduation would be to make use of the method of continual bisection. It insures a unifo1mity in the system, whicl.i in diyiding is of paramount importance, and, moreover, has tlw iuh·antage of being ver;y simple in principle. If we haYe to bisect any arc, the correct place for the midway line is ea,sily fouml by traciug a trial line as near as can be done in the middle. lf it is in the right place, ont>-half of the arc as thus bisected must necessarily equal the other. Sbould one 1w0Ye to be larger than the other, it is clear that one-half of this excess is to be taken from this arc to make it equal the other. Unfortunately the diyb.ion into ~mo degrees does not allow a continual bisection. \Y c can onl~ go as far a..;; to bisect the four quadrants again in two halves, Yiz, 450. A fnrtber biseetion would uot bring ws to au even degree. Hut rather thau gfre up the method of bisection, and make use of trisection, and eventually of quiui section, I concluded to ignore the degrees altogether, and merely 1n·oduce a division of equal parts, which ultimately could be conrnrted into the proper degreP 1li\·isiou. Two hundred and fifty-six is the higlrnRt lJisectional number which it was thought convenient to use, alld which would divide the circle into spaces, each of which would equal le '.!-1' 2'.!".;). It is perfectly easy and safe to deduce the proper 3600 division from the 256 E>qnal parts. Tl.Jc first step in the process is to lay oft' by means of the screw 256 lines 011 the circle as nearly equidistant. as the screw can do it. Great exactness ii; not essential, although it is desirable to Lave the errors of these 256 lim·s small. 1t is evident that if the threads in the circle are all in their true places, these '.!56 parts would necessarily be equal; aud, agaiu, should it be found that they differed from each other, the amonut of such difference would be tlie correctio11 for the scre\v for that part. Having laid off these 256 parts, the next step iu the process is to examine them and compnk their individual errors. ]!'or this purpose two micrometer-microscopes, A and H, are placed diametricall_y opposite. Line 0 is under A; line 180 under B, with which latter coincidence is made. \Yithont disturbiug the microscopes the circle is turned until line 180 is under A, and coincidence is made by tmniug the circle by means of its own screw. Should microscope B now bisect line o, it is twideut that these lines have divided the cirde into two equal parts. Should such not he the case, oue-half of the difference found would be the <>rror of the line. Two methods can now be pursued: Either we can regard each line as being in H,- tnH' place, and continue the examination, forming a table of apparent errors, from which the absolute errors can be afterwards com1mted, or else we can at once find the absolute error of the line under examination as we proceed, and correct it by tracing a new line. The field of the microscope1< was lar!Ie enough to include these uew corrected lines. The latter method seemed to me to be the best as being less liable to the i11trodudio11 of error, and as it also saved the trouble of shifting the microscopes twice to the same place. The method employed to correct erroneous lines is (}Uite sim11le. Knowing the screw-reading when this line was cut~a table having of course been formed to lay off the 256 parts-it was only S.Ex.17-25

necessary to turn this screw to the amount of the errors aml trace a uew line. The errors as found by the obserYing microFcope D were expressed in tenths of secouds; one division on the head being equal to that amount. The engine screw had a larg·e head diYided into single seconds; the tenths were here estimated, which could readily be done, as one second was represented by nearly one-tenth of an inch. By observing the new line again unde1· the microscope, we liud whetber the two arcs are now equal. No trouble was experienced in tracing a corrected line. Haying thus divided the circle , into two equal parts, one microscope. is now remoYed and placed D0° from the otber. Line O is again brought under A; line 90 is under B, with wbich eoiuciLlence is made. The circle is now turned 900 until line 90 comes under A. when line 180 will be nmler n. If it has been found that }{ bisects again, line DO is in its true place. If not, one-half of the differenee is applied and a new line traced. The same is done witb line 270° on the other isemicirclc, after which microscope B is sbiftd one-half of the former amount, viz, 45°, and the examination of the eig·ht 450 arcs is proceeded with, when we will get the corrected lines O, 45, 90, mu, 180, 22.1, 270, and 315. This being done Bis moved again a. distance of 22° 3W, and 16 arcs are measured. Thus step by step we come down by repeated bisection to arcs corresponding to 11° l;Y, r;o Ti' 30", and 2° 48' 45". This latter quantity will now be too small to allow the microscope;; to come any nearer; but the difficulty is overcome by skipping one line, and instead of taking one-half take one part and one-half, viz, 40 13' 7".5. We have thus obtained 236 equal parts. To deduce from these .'300 equal parts is simple, as it is merely a matter of proportion. I procee(led in this mani1er: Line 0 was brought under the microscope and the screw-by means of which tl1e coincidence was made-read off; the circle was then turned by meanR of the screw until the next 256th line came under the same microscope when it had been movPtl 1° 24' 22 11 J1, the screw index was again read, aud from the number of whole turns and parts of turns which the screw had been tnrned in order to make the circle 1° 24' 22 11 .5, the proportional part wa>; taken and a degree line cut. The readings of the engine screw, as thus found, give of course the corrections for each corresponding degree. This final result is shown in the following table. By inspecting it., it will be found that the largest error to be corrected is 11" .5. To obYiatc the use of pins and minus signs, the screw index was placed at division Hi.O instead of 0.

The use of the foregoing table in graduating other circles is apparent. Although we have onl,r 360 equal parts, yet the screw of the engine is of such excellence that we are fully justified in using it for the suhdivision of each degree, especially as the errors differ so gradually. It may be mentioned here that the engine screw has by long usage so ground itself into the circle that it now takes hold of nearly 60; that is, 71 threads. It would be almost impossible to make a screw like it, as the threads have now so ada11ted themselves to the circle that they are no longer parallel, but converge towards the center of the circle. The steel of which tlti8 screw is made is of such uniform texture that after all the wear it now runs perfectly true.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

If we want to make use of tbe foregoing table to obtain a .i' or 10' diYisio11 we must only apply the correction from degree to degree proportionally to each 1mbdivision. As the correction for two successJYe degrees in no case exceeds 0 11 .6, it is C\'ident that a subdivision into 51 spaces will not have an;-, appreciable error. Several large circles, from H to 20 inches in diameter, haYe heeu graduated by means of this table. It ha<l, of course, to be llonc by hand, as before drawing a line the screw bad to be set to the required reading. This operation being tedionR in the extreme, ef'pecially, it 8hould he remern· be red, aH tl1e temperature had to be maintained at 98° F ., and as at most 30° coul1l be so <lh'ided in one day, tlms requiring two weeks for each circle, it was desirable to make the machine automatic in correcting its own errors. As tlli8 wonld hfffc taken considerable time, and as a great many circles required gradlmtion, I hit npou the following plau, which ma;r be called half automatic, and wbich enabled me to graduate a circle iu about eight hours. It was done in the followi11g manner: The 8crew gi\'ing the 1uo11er angular motion to the circle is propelled by means of a cliain fastened to a crank-pin of a driving-wheel and wound around a cylinder, which in going forward turns the screw by meam; of clicks taking hold of the ratchet-wheel attached to one end of the screw. Thi" operation takes place when the cmnk-pin of the dri>ing-wheel is going down. Having reache<l tl1c rlead center, thl' chain with the cylinder is moved back by a weight attached to the other end of the chain, the clicks gliding now iu au opposite direction oyer the ratchet-wheel of tbe screw. The amount of motion given to the circle depend8, of course, on the motion of the 1-;crew, which is controlled by mean8 of two Rtops on the cylinder acting between t·wo blocks or airYils. 'J'hese being set properly, the circle will, of c01tr8e, be ahYa,vs moved forward the same angular distance. To move it more or less could be effected by mm'ing the anvils confining the movement. l\f.r idea of thus correcting the errors was to hare these anvils adjustable instead of having tliem fixed. I arranged them so that b~- turning a screw the anYil defining the forward rno,'ement could be raised or lowered. Being lowered, it had the effect of making the screw go more forward; beiug raised, it could not go so far. Both anvils were on the same piece; thus one was raisell ju8t as much as the other was lowered. This is very important, in order that the total amount the screw should turn would not differ. To allow the chain to go down when the anvils were at the lowt'!St extremity a strong spring was inserted in the chain, which bad enough action to insure a firm bearing of the stops whether the anvils were up or down. The screw by which this mo,-ing of the anvils was effected was so made that one-quarter turn made a correction of 0".1. Didding a circle into 51 spaces this amou11t of correction from one line to another is never exceeded, and as it could be done without interfering with the automatic action of the engine, the drcles were really all divided automatically by the machine, the correction merely, as the cylinder was turning back, being given hy hand in moving the anvils the quantity the screw should read at each particular line. Fntil the new arrangement for the automatic correction of errors, a plan of which I herewith snhmit, is attached, all circles will be divided by this method. Those already so divided show that the former existing errors in thl' machine have been successfully corrected. In regar1l to an automatic correction of the errors, the idea which suggests itself first to the mind to gain this end. is to make the" anvils," which define the motion of the screw, either movable, or to makfl the periphery of a wheel answer as the ai1Yil. This wheel for every line to be cut could he made to move forward a sullicicnt quantity to present enough new surface upon which the stop would work; and it is e'rident that if thii; periphery is shape<l to correspond to the errors of the machine, and if we had enough surface on the wheel, the desired end would be gained. Practically, however, several difficulties are encountered. Unless the wheel were of snch unwieldy proportion that each 5' line could have its correct,ed anvil, two wheels would have to be n8ed, one corresponding to the forward, the other to the backward anvil; for if we use a wheel of, sa;L 15 inches in (liameter, which gives us for each <legree an anvil of about 1\ 1 inch, it is only the deg-ree lines that would be corrected, and if; say, we bad a correction for one degree, amounting t,o + l ".O, tl1i8 correction would be repeated with every line until the next "degree anvil" bad come under the stop, unless the back ward stop bad moved up just as much as the forward one bad been lowered; for it must not he forgotten that the screw must not make more than one full turn,

excepting at the place where a correction is 1leRircd. Dy making the wheel of ,-ery large size, in order to have enough periphery for eYery 5' liHe, thiR difticult,v could lie oYercome, hut the wheel would have to han:i a diameter of at least;~ feet. Nor is this the onl,\' difl1cnlty. Another ,-ery serious one ari8es from the fact that thP chain of the "Uriving-Wheel '' turning the Rtop-Ul'lllll would be altemately tig·htened 01' R]ackelle!l as t]w eorrecterl places 011 the periphery were plus or miuns. 'l'his is a ver,v serious objection, a8 tlrn motion of the sere''" and the pressure of tlw stop against the anYil should be as uniform as possibll'. · These difficulties led me to c01rnidcr another 11la11, in which the motion of the 8Crt'w is left entirely undisturbed, and the corrcctio11 of the errors is obtained by monng the whole screw "laterally" and in sucL a war as to correct the error while the screw is gearing into the circle. In the annexed sketch a a. a reprcsent8 a portion of the euginc circle; g g iR a rib projecting below the circle, and into whicli I propoRC to im;ert :360 adjnRting screws, eacl1 one to correspond to a degree of the gra<lnation; ff represents a Jong leYer, wltich has its fulcrum at d. The long arm of this }eyer pres8es against tlte adjusting- screws; the short arm presses agaim;t the frame or plate carrying the screw; this plate slides iu a (lO\'etail slide laterally, and i;.; pressed against the lever by means of a weight or spring. Now it is evideut if a11y of the screws 1m~jeet more than the others that the Je,·er would be turned more, and consequently the circle shift.ed more to the left. The loug and short arms of the 'lp,·er arP as 50 x 1; arnl a8 1" corre8powls to about 9-"10,, of an incli, to obtain such a, correction tl1e long arm would han· to be moYed about rh of an inch. ~~s the whole range of errors is about 13 seconds, the entire range of moYing the frame of the screw required is about 7-f, 0 of an inch. It is of the greate8t moment tliat the 8C'rew shall not change it8 tangential relation to the circle. This is easily secured by making the bed-plate carrying the screw moYe in a circular slide concfmtric with the diYiding engine circle. This if> shown 011 the sketch by b b, the bed-plate moving between the slide-gnides cc, C('. It is a very simple matter to adjust thel'e screws hy taking one degree line as zpro aml bisecting it with a microscope; it is oul~· necessary to turn the screw one d<·gree ( = 12 turns) to see whether the next line is bisected. If so, there is no error; if not~ turn the screw in opposition to the lever until the circle has been moYcd the necessary quantit;y. The long end of the le,·er is polished, hardened, and tapered off~ in order to make the correc· tions from degree to degree gradual. I think that this methml will work very well; so far as my experiments haYe shown, it lea.Yes nothing to be desireil. Nor will it require much alteration on the engine. Irn;t(·ad of having the screw-frame fixed we have it moyable in a slide; we add a long leYer and the necessar;r ad,iusting screws. But I hope that before we undertake the automatical correction of the circfo you will remember the plea for a good axis, without which all correetions and work llone ou the engine will only be partially successful. It is my firm opinion that the errors which we find in the graduated circles can be greatly reduced by having the present axis replaced h,Y a bett,er one. As it is, to arrive at such results in graduation as I have achieved, it is indis1iensable to have the temperature constant at 98°. Respectfully submitted. H. N.

A number of theodolites graduated by J\fr. Saegmuller upcm the diYiding engine with the aid of his table of errors were examined at thiR office by the method explained in Appendix n, Coast Survey Report of 1877. It is there stated that ''It should he borne in mind that it is not claimed for the method of

lJi- or tri-section that it is an absolute test of the accuracy of graduation. In every tri-section the three individual rnadingt> arc referred each to the mean of the three, and the smallness of the resulting residuals is the criterion of the general accuracy." Yet as each tri-section is entirel~ independent of every other one, it is evident that we have no check upon the accuracy of the angular space between auy two diYisious not exactly 120° apart; an(l thns errors having a period of 1200 will uot a,ppear h,Y this method, the principal value of which consists in showing the probable value of accidental errors, or of errors having a period not commensurate with 1200. If we deti~rmi1rn the effect of the eccentricity upon an.y giYeu reading aud correct this reading for it, we will liaYe left the residual error of graduation and pointing. These residual errors are given below on Table I for every 5° for theodolites Nos. 5 and 118, and for every 10" for theodolite Xo. 133, to illustrate the manner in which the probable errors of graduation giYc11 in Table II have been deduced for these and other theodolites .. As the theodolitcH examined have difterent diameters, it is necessary for purposes of comparison to reduce the probable errors which are expressed in angular ralues to linear ones, as shown in columns ;; and 0.

TU A REPORT ON A PHYSICAL SURYEY OF THE DELA\Y,\Irn RIYEH, BY IIEXRY MITCHELL, ASSISTANT CNITEJl STATES COAST AKD GEODETIC fWiffEY.

BOSTON, Jfarclt, 1881. DEAR Sm : In my report upon Delaware RiYer, printed as A ppemlix .X o. n to tlw lfoport of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1878. I made the following statement: "Other things equal, the size of a channel through allu.-iums may be ~mid to Yar~· directly as the amount of sei..-ice whicl1 it is e11lled upon to perform as a conduit.'' In the extra copies of this Report, distributed among profe,..sional and interested parties, the word "tidal" was inserted before the word channel. This statement, so widely at variance with all writers upon h:nlrodyuami.es, was a theoretical deduction from the laws of tides, and I confosil that 1 did not expect that I could offer from the .-ery scene of my labors the practical illustration which follows. Indeed, 1 was >;omewhat shaken in my own belief when I found, upon further reasoning from the theoretical staBdpoint, that two other conclusions were made necessary, still more at variance with preconceiYe<l ideas. I will state these three conclusions in their order, premising that <illuriul tidal l"hannels art· in question. 1st. The transverse section is directly proportional to the di,.;charg1» 2d. The wiclth is proportional to discharge. 3d. 'l'he mean deptl1 is the same in all .-;ectious. Ju otl.ier words, a natural cono;taut is found. The table which follows was compile1l hy Henry I,. Marindin from the Coa8t Snrwy Chart of Delaware Bay, and the diagram which he has made of the results I haYe place<l after Uw table in order to displa;v to the eye without effort the success of the experiment. :\Ir. :\larindin used the planimeter for determining areas and mean widths, so that more thau usual rigor was exercisPd in his computations. You will obserYe that for the portion of' the ba,v below artificial obstructions and abon tlw counteraction of the ·waves of the ocean my three rules hold good in a remarkable manner. The width is affocteil by the wear of the wayes upon the shore to a ~reater degree than the other elements, as might haye been expectml; but tlle mean depth for a distance of sixty-eight miks below League Island differs from the a·emge (sixteen feet) only in oue instance as mm.:h as three feet, and in eight ont of the fourteen sections in this distance the variation 1loes not exceed one foot. In this distance the width varies from a half mile to o-ver t\Yenty miles, arnl eYer~- c011ceiYable form of shoal vexes the navigation. At a first glance at the chart one would think that mere chance disposed of channels, islands, and shoals, but our table brings order out of this chaos. Yours, respectfully, IHJNiff )fITCHEI.,L, Assistant Coast and Ocodetic 8urtcy. CARLILE I'. PATTERSON, LL. D., Superintendent Coast and Geodetfo Sur1·ey.

ON THE INTERNAL CONSTITUTION OF THE EARTH.
(Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1879.)

1. The law of the increase of deusity of the earth from the surface to the center Las been well investigated by R. Lipschitz. His memoir is published in the 62d volume of Orelle's :MatLematical Journal, and his formula is gfren ou t.11e 35th page. If x denotes the mean radius of any homogeneous stratum, referred to the mean radius of the earth as unitJ, the density k is k = 9.453-6.953 af·-:lli From this formula the density of the earth for different strata is given in the second column of the subjoined table. The first column contaius the corresponding mean radius of the stratum. 2. From the above formula, the gravity (g) at the surface of a stratum, referred to the gr.:wity of the whole earth at its surface as unity, neglecting the centrifugal force, is
g=

Its value is given in the third column of the table. ;.t, If the earth were liquid, the pressure p upon each square inch of eYer~· st.ratum, estimatRil in thousands of pounds, neglecting the centrifugal force of rotation and ellipticity, is giYen by the formula,

Its valt1e is given in the fourth column of the table. 4. Were the earth's interior in convective equilibrium in conformity to the theory of Sir William Thomson, the increase of density should correspond to the increase of pressure. The immense incompressibility I' which would thence result is exhibited in the fifth column of the table, which represents the incompressibility in terms of water as unity, in passing from the surface of oue stratum to the next interior stratum of the table.

ON HitlTHl,'MENTS AND METHODS USED FOR PRECISE LEVELING IN 'fHE COAS'l' AND GEODETIC seRVEY. REPORT BY 0. H. TITTMANN, ASSISTANT.

The leveling instruments adopted by the Superintendent for the precise work of the survey, are in principle the same as those known as the "Vienna" or "Stampfer" levels. Their introduction in 1877, with important additions in the accessory parts, and tbe manner of using them, is due to AsRistant J. E. Hilgard. The principle underlying the construction of these instruments is~ that the telescope can be mornd in a vertical plane about a horizontal axis by means of a micrometer screw.' This construction is especially adapted to the object bad in view, namely, of multiplying the pointings on a mark eith1·r in the horizon of the instrument or at an angle above or below it, even beyond the measuring range of the striding level. It was supposed that the accuracy of the striding level, where a large number of its .divisionR was involved, would be impaired by its expmmre to the influences of the wind and of changing temperatures in the open air. It was therefore decided to use it only to define the horizontality of the telescope, but to measure any inclination of the latter by means of the micromet<ir screw. In using a target rod, therefore, it would only be necessa1·y to bring the target approximately into the horizon, which efl'ects a saving in time and an increase in accuracy over the usual attempt to bring the target exactly into the line of sight. The meth0<l is equally adapted to observing on rods without targets, and presents the obvious advantage of enabling the observer to attempt a bisection of any graduared space on the rod near the horizon. These instruments are known in the survey as geodesic levels." In their present form they are constructed as follows (see accompanying illustration)~ A liorizontal plate is fastened in the middle to the vert.ieal axis of the instrument. One end of this plate carries the nut of a vertical micrometer-screw passing through it. This screw serves to raise or lower one end of the superstructure: which is pivoted to the other end of the fixed plate. The superstructure consists of two uprights, joined somewhat below tlieir middle by another horizontal plate. The upper portions of the uprights are fashioned into wyes, and carry the telescope and the sliding level; the lower portions are cut out so as to leave guide pieces passing outside the lower phite. A capstan-headed pivot-screw passes through each guide piece at one end int-0 small sockets iu the fixed pfate. Passing through the fixed plate the micrometer screw moves between the guide pieces at the other end and abuts against a small steel surface. The fixed plate carries an index, and one of the guide pieces a corresponding scale to register the whole turns of the micrometer, and also a pointer for reading the subdivisions on tbe micrometer head, of which there a.re 100. Near the micrometer end the fixed plate carries a cam-hook, which, on being turned, passes into a staple below the upper plate, raising it and everything above it off the micrometer screw during transportation. For the purpose of raising the telescope out of its wyes during transportation the upper plate carries two false wyes at the end of two arms, which are so pivoted and connected with a milled-head screw, passing through the middle of the plat{), that by turning it the telescope may be raised on the false wyes and pressed securely against semicircular guards fastened across the true wres; by the same means it may be lowered into its proper bearings for observation. The telescope rests in its wyes between two shoulders, on collars of bell· metal. Each shoulder carries a projecting pin, which, when it abuts against corresponding pins in the upright, defines two positions 180° apart, in which the observing tliread is horizontal
*The nun11 r1wde;ig is common to the English, German, and French languages: the use of its derivatives, geodeUc -ical, geodeaic-ical, remains unsettled. \Ve propose to use the harrl form "geodetic" for the immediate adjective signifying things of the same kind and quality as the noun, and the softer form, geoieWJ (instead of gwdetical), for the deriYed adjective, applicable to matters relating to or incidental to geodesy. Hence, geodetic survey, goodesic level.

when the te1escope is turned about its optical axis. The diaphragm in the telescope is of glass, and has two horizontal and one vertical line ruled upon it. A clamp and tangent movement for accurate lateral pointing connects the vertical axis through the fixed pJate wit.h the external part of its socket. The vertical axis aml socket pass downwards below the le\'eling screws, through the tripo1l head, to which the instrument is secured by means of a milled-head nnt, threads for which are cut on the external part of the socket. A hemispherical washer of wood, fitting into a corresponding cavity in the tripod head between it and the nut, gives all the play required by the leveling screws. The instmmE-nt. is further secured by means of a brass plate, which may be clamped to the ti-ipod head in such a manner as to fit over shoulders on the leveling screws, which arc sunk into the tripod head to the necessary depth. The level proper is a striding level, not fastened to the telescope. The above description applies equally to the two forms of the instrument in use in the survey, with this exception, that geodesic level No. 1 has its vertical axis entirely above the tripod, awl that it is much lighter than Nos. 2 and 3. Most of the precise leveling has been done so far with No. 1. The smaller instrument, inclusive of tripod, weighs 23 pounds, while the weight of the larger is 45 pounds. The telescope of No. 1 has an aperture of about 35mm, a focal length of .1()7mm, and a magnifying power of 26. One millimeter of the level scale equals 3".5. The telescopes of Nos. 2 and 3 have apertures of 43mm, focal lengths of 410m 1, and magnif.ying powers of about 37. The value of one millimeter of the level scale equals 1".5. Rod a.nd target (see illustmtion).-The rods are made of well-seasoned white-pine wood, oiled and varniRhed, and are a little more than 3 meters long. Each rod consists of a main strip of wood 7.5cm wide and 2.5c thick, along the center of each broad face of which is screwed and glued another strip of the same length, and 2.5·m wide and 2.5·m thick. A target, provided with guide pieces, and a friction spring, can be moved up and down one of the faces of the rod by means of an endless ehain running over a fixed pulley at the bottom, and an adjustable one near the top of the rod. The chain passes through a clamp convenient to the rodman's hand. The target carries with it, at right angles to its face, a small ivory scale, graduated to millimeters, moving over a strip of brass let into the rod and extending its whole length. The brass is gmduatetl to centimeters, and can be read to fractional parts <1f a millimeter by means of the ivory scale. The brass scale is fastened in the middle immovably to the rod, and is held in its groO\'e by means of screws at the back passing through slots, so that the brass may freely expand towards the top and bottom, and it forms the scale proper on which all differences of heights are measured. The temperature is registered by means of a thermomet.er let into the rod. A handle screwed on that face of the rod opposite to the target, a.nd a small circular level, enable the rodman to hold the rod vertical. That faeeof the rod which carries the target is graduated to centimeters, and ser"es the double purpose of a telemeter and of checking the reading of the brass scale, as will be explained further on. The foot of the rod is a rounded piece of brass, which is intended to rest in a corresponding depression in the foot plates. The foot plates are circular disks of cast iron, about 15cm in diameter, with depressions in the center for receiving the feet of the rods, and with prongs on the under side to secure immobility when properly pressed in.to the ground. Another support which has been used in thawing ground is a pin of wrought iron about 15cm Jong, increasing from a point to a diameter of about 5cm on top, which also contains a cavity for the reception of the foot of the rod. These pins must be driven i.uto the ground with a maul. The following adjustments of the instruments should be made and prestrved: 1. Ta adj'Ullt the slidi~ level far "wind," or t.o make it parallel with the axis of the collars.Turn the lateral counter-screws ou the level until the bubble remains between the same di\-isions of the scale when the level, while resting on the collars of the telescope, i'3 revolved to one side or the other of the vertical plane passing through the axis of the collars. 2. To mm the Mis of the l,etiel parallel to the plane of its Bttpparts.-This is accomplished by noting the reading of thil level in a direct and reversed position on the telescope and by correcting one half of the deviation of the bubble by means of the vertical ac.ljusting screw of the level, and the other half by means of the micrometer screw under the tel~ope.

3. To rna."Jre the a.ris of the instrument vertical and perpendicular to that of the level.-The previous adjustments ha,·iug been made, the bubble is made to play and the vertical axis is turned 180°. One half of the deviation of the bubble is corrected by means of the foot screws and the other half by means of the micrometer screw. This adjustment having been perfected, the reading of the micrometer, which then corresponds to a horizoutal pointing of the telescope, should be noted. 4. To adj1tSt the horizontctlit.1/ of the middle thread.-When the instrument is leveled and the abutting pins intended to define the horizontality of the thread are in contact, and the telescope is pointed on a distant mark, the latter should remain bisected by the thread as long as it remains in the field of view, when the telescope is moved in azimuth. The adjustment is made by turning ·, the diap.b.ragm the requisite amount. · 5. To adjust the collimation.-Point the telescope on a mark at a conv-enient dii;tance, and then turn it 1800 about its optical axis. If the intersection of the vertical and horizontal thread deviates from the pointing in the first poi:iition, correct one-half of the Yertical deviation by means of the micrometer and one-half of the lateral deviation by means of the tangent screw, and the rest by means of the adjusting screws of the diaphragm. It is only necessary, however, that the horizontal thread should be put inw the line of collimation as nearly as may be. -when this adjustment ltas been made by pointing 011 a mark at a consider:tble distance, it should be tested on one so much nearer that the focus of the telescope requires changing. If the adjustment remains, the motion of the ocular is paraJlel to the geometrical and optical axis of the t"1escope, but,, if not, a mechanician alone can make the required adjustment. G. To d,etennine 1vhetlier the telescope moves in a vertical plane.-This is an adjustment depending on the construction of the instrument, and may be tested by pointing the telescope on a plumbline and seeing whether the line of sight travels along it when it iis raised 01· depressed. by means of the micrometer screw. If it does not, a remedy may be sought for iu a readjustment of the pivot screws of the superstructure. 7. To determine the angular value of a revolution of the 1nicrom-eter.-Tbis depends on the distance between the threa<ls of the screw and the distance between the center of the screw and the pivots. Even though we assume the revolutions of the micrometer screw to be proportional to the arc through which the telescope moves, their angular value will vary on account of the eccentricity of the line of sight in reference to the pivots of the superstructure. As the reduction of the target to the horizon is generally less than 5mru, which, at 100"', corresponds to an angular value of only 10", it is apparent that even in extreme cases the average value of a revolution clerived by the following method will be amply sufficient for our purposes: Level the iILStrument, with the micrometer set at the horizontal reading of the telescope. At as great a distance, accurately measured, at which the scale-marks remain perfectly defined, set up a vertical scale or one of the rods. MeMure the angular value between the divisions of the scale iu terms of the micrometer to the amount of about two tu·rns above, and as many below the horiwntal reading of the micrometer. Let D = the distance between the pi Yo ts of the superstructure and the rod; Let d =the distance between the scale divisions of the rod, expressed in the same uuit of measure as D; Let m= the difference in reading of the micrometer, when the telescope points on the upper aml lower scale divisions expressed in terms of the micrometer; Then one turn, t, of the micrometer expressecl iu seconds of arc= .. -. _d .. - . , and theref~re D sm 1 /1 xm the linear value, d, of t for any distance Dis, d = t D sin 1", and this is tabulated for convenience of reduction. It may here be remarked that it is not absolutely necessary to determine either the micrometer or level value or the inequalities of the collars in angular measure. The two latter may be expressed in micrometer divisious, and the linear value of these for any particular <listance may be obtained as above described, and for intermediate distances it may be obtained by interpolation and tabulated. 8. To determine the angular 110.lue of one division of the level soale.-Mount the level on the t.ele· soo~ and observe the number of level-sea.le divisions through which the bubble moves when the teles(I011e is raised or depressed through a given angle by means of the micrometer screw.

9. To determine the inequality of the collars of the telescope.-Mount the instrument firml~' and level it carefully. Measure the inclination of the telescope in its wyes by rev-ersals of the level. Carefully lift the telescope and, turning it end for end, replace it so tllat the object-end collar shall be in the wye in which the e.re-end collar was before, and again measure the inclination of the telescope. This should be repeated with the telescope im'erted or turned ll-10° about its optical axis nntil a satisfactory value has been obtained in both positions of the telescope. Let I= the inclination of the telescope when <lirect. l 11 =the inclination of the telescope when reYersed. j Erect. Let i = the inclination of the telescope when direct. } i1 =the inclination of the telescope when reversed· lnYerted. Then the inequality of collars,

It=~

[

'I (-~-

I') + (: '-~-=j:-i"')]

and the correction to be applied t:o an observed sight at tl1e distance D, will equal D h sin 1", and should be computed and tabulated. If the objoot-end collar is too large the line of sight will be inclined downwards when the targent plane to the upper surface of the collars is horizontal. This constant should be determined at the beginning and end of each season's work. 10. To determine the distance between the rod and instrument by means of the distmwe threads in the diaphragm.-For the purpose of reducing the target reading to the horizon it is necessary t:o know the distance of the rod from the instrument. Although the ang'le between tlie distance threads changes with a change in the focus of the telesco11e, a table gi\-ing the distances corresponding to the difference of the readings of the threads on the rod, with sufficient precision, mar be constructed as follows: Set up the rod at the measured distances of, say, 20 and 150 meters, and observe the space (which will form the "argument" of the table) intercepted b;\' the distance threads on the painted graduation of the rod. Interpolate the table for intermediate distances and exteud it proportionally. The extreme threads should be equidistant from the middle one for convenience of observing. If they are not, the distance should always be measured between the same two threads to avoid confusion in the record. Verijicati-On and adjustment of the rod$.-The brass scale should be compared with a standard for total length and uniformity of graduation. Its coefficient of expansion must be known or be determined. Its immobility, when attache.d to the rod, should be tested. The graduation of the millimder scale should be examined. The thermometer should be compared with the standard. The zero of the millimeter scale should correspond to the center of the target; if it does not, a correction must be applied whenever the rod reading is t:o be referred to a bench-mark on which the foot of the rod cannot be placed. The target should be horizontal when the rod is vertical. The level on the rod should be adjusted to indicate the verticality of the rod. This may be tested by suspending a plummet from the rod. The chain, which is apt to streooh by usage, shonld not be allowed t:o become too slack; links may be taken out of it if the range of the movable pulley has been exbansted. The distance of zero point of the graduation above the foot of the rod should be determined and the temperature noted. This distance is called the index error of the rod. Each rod should be designated by a letter or number.
METHOD.

The method of leveling adopted is that known as "leveling from the middle," or, more properly defined, that of equidistant back and fore sights. The manner of taking the sights is t-0 bring the target of the rod nearly into the horizon of the telescope, and to measure with the micrometer the :vertieal angle between the horizon and the target by repeated point.fogs, so arrauged as to eliminate errors of level and collimation. The target reading on the rod is then reduced to the horizon by computation. With this method, two sysooms have been in use hitherto:

206

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

I. Simultaneou.~ double levening in one direction.-By this the difference in height between two benches is determined h.v observing from the same station and with the same instrument, backsights on two different rods, set up at unequal distances from the instrument, and foresights on the same two rods, carried forward and pla.ced at the same relativ-e distances previously occupied. This method ma,y he symholically represented by two arrows, joined in the middle, pointing in the same direction, thus: ~ . The successfre positions of the instrument and rods are shown on the_ diagram:

A

B

2. Levelling in opposite directions.-This consists in running a line between two benches in one direction, and relevelling it according t-0 the same method in the opposite one, and may be symbolized hy two arrnws pointiug iu opposite directions: ~. S,ystcm 1 offers the advantage of a considerable saving in time over system 2 1 and affor1ls a perfect check against errors of observation from station to station, since the difference in height between two rods, obtained in a foresight, should be equa.l to the difference obtained in the following backsigllt. If the rods are set up at unequal distances from the instrument, say the nearest at 25 meters and the farthest at mo, the foresights on the two rods will define the inclination of a plane to which, that defined by the backsights on the rods in the same position should be parallel This parallelism will be a test of the existence of any consti111t instrumental error. Such an error would produce a want of para.llclism in the two planes equal to twice its effect in one direction. System 2, on tlie other hand, oilers the advantage of making the determinations in opposite directions under <lifferent couditions, and of exhibiting with greater certainty the existence of any cumulative errors. (See page 207.) In Iudia the direction of operation was alternated in consecutive sections for the purpose of compemmtiug cumulative errors; aud w bile the final result between two extremely distant stations ma,y by such a process be freed from error, yet intermediate heights might he aftooted by cousidcr!l>ble ones.
METHOD OF OBSERVING.

Plant the tripod firmly, either directly on the ground, or, if necessary, on iron pins driven into

it, with the top of the tripod nearly horizontal, and with the legs so spread as to be least liable to
disturbance by a movement of the observer. Loosen the clamp nut under the tripod head. Let the telescope down into its wyes by lowering the false ones in which it rests during transportation. Tnrn the cam-hook until the plate carrying the telescope rests on the micrometer screw, which is supposed to be set to its. horizontal reading. Mount the striding level, and level the instrument a11proximatcly-that is, until the bubble remains in view, when the instrument is revolved in azimuth. Sight on the rod, and adjust the focus of the telescope and eye-piece. A motion to the rodman to mo\·e the target until it is neal'ly bisected by the middle thread is followed by another to clamp it there, after which the rodman must give his sole atrention to holding the rod vertical by watching the hubble of the attached level. a. Next the observer, watching the striding level, turns the micrometer screw until the bubble is in some determinate position, for instance, until an equal length of it is on each side of the center of the level scale. It may be found advisable to select divisions at unequal distances from the center, which, being systematically adhered to, will always show whether the position of the level is direct or reversed. Oare should be taken to avoid parallax in reading the level, particularly when an attached mirror is used. · Then the designating number or letter of the rod pointed on, the position of the telescope and level, and the reading of the micrometer corresponding to the a.dopt.ed level reading, are recorded. A pointing is next ma.de on the target by turning the micrometer sere:w, the reading of which is again recorded when the horizontal thread bisects the target.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

207

b. The level is reversed, and the micrometer is turned until the bubble of the level is between the same divisions as in the first rea<ling, then the target is bisected, and the micrometer readings for level and target are recorded. c. The t~lescope is inverted or turned 1800 about its optical axis, the level remaining reversed as before. Again the micrometer is turned until the bubble is between the selected didsions, and then until the target is bisected, and the corresponding readings are recorded. d. The level is shifted into its direct position, its bubble is brought between the selected divisions, and the micrometer is read. Lastly, another pointing is made on the target, and the micromefor readings are recorded. Then the observer notes the readings of the upper and lower edges of the target and of the distance threads on the painted graduation of the rod. The rodman reads the scale and thermom· eter, and records them in a book which he carries for the purpose. His reading of the scale is verified by the recorder, and should correspond within a few millimeters to the mean obtained from the observer's reading of the upper and lower edge of the target. If the system of simultaneous double levelling is followed, the obserYer will generall~· finish all the observations (a, b, c, d) on one rod before beginning on the next one~ in ordel' to give one of the rodmen time to advance while the obsen-ations on the other arc being· made. If system~ is followed, the observations ma,y be so arranged as to make the mean of the times of making the four observations on each rod the same, provided always that the rods are so nearly equidistant that the focus of the telescope does not require changing, as that might affect the collimation. Such a sequence of obsen·ing is shown by the numerals in the following scheme:

Rod Z, 1, ab
4, c d

During the observations the instrument should be screened from the sun b,y an llmbrella. Before carrying the instrument forward it should be clamped to the tripod head by means of the nut. 'l'he false wyes should be screwed up to support the telescope, and the cam-hook should be urned to raise the superstructure oft' the micrometer screw. The true distances of the rods from the instrument are obtained, as already stated, by means of the distance threads in the telescope, for purposes of reduction, but their position is selected at as nearly equal distances from the iustrument as possible, b_y careful pacing of the rodmen. Where the slope of the ground is steep the distances may be taken as great as possible, and on comparatively level ground they may range from 50 to 150 meters, according to tlie co11dition of the weather and atmosphere. The rodmen should exercise great care to plant the foot supports firmly in the ground, and to keep clean the cavities in which the feet of the rods rest. River crossing.-When a line of levels has to be carried across a wide river, and where, from the lowness of the banks, the line of sight would pass very near to the water, the instrument should be elevated so as t-0 be above the vitiating influence of irr~gular refraction. If possible, two instruments should be mounted on opposite sides of the river, and simultaneous obsen·ations should be made on targets mounted near the respective instruments. The elevation of ~ach target above a bench-mark on its side of therirnr must be carefully determined, and each target and instrument should be as nearly as possible in the horizon of the other. The observations are made in the usual manner; if the distance across is not otherwise known with sufficient accuracy, the known value of the micrometer will serve to determine it snfficientl~' for purposes of reduction, by measuring across the river the length of a rod or other known length in terms of the micrometer. The inequality of collars being known in terms of the micrometer, the correction may be applied directly in that form. If only one instrument is available, observations made in one direction sboultl be repeated ais soon as possible in the other, and several times alternately in opposite directions. By the observations in opposite directions the effect of refraction may be supposed to be eliminated, as is that of curvature. It is shown, however, by observations made expressly for the pur})OS~ over a distance across the Potomac River of 6SO meters, at different elevations, that it is necessary to elevate the instru. ment at least 10 feet above the water, in order to obtain results free from the effects of irregular

208

refraction. Although more than twice as great as that usually admitted (being found about 0.27 against 0.12), the results obtained at elevations of 11 and 17 feet from observations in opposite directions show a satisfactorv agreement, while observations made at a height of 4 feet above the water gi\·e a wide range in the results. The details of this experimental work are given in the paper immediately following the present one.
IlENCH·MARKS.

The nature and location of the bench-marks will depend on the purposes they are intended to subserve, and are permanent or temporary. To the latter class belong those which are only intemled to afford a check on the leveling operations and a test of their accura.cy. They may consist of nails or spikes driven into trees, telegraph poles, or into pegs driven into the ground, while permanent ones are intended to secure the results of the work for all time. Public or private buildings, the piers of bridges, or outcropping ledges of rock will generally afford good points of reference, but where these do not exist, and yet permanent benches are required, cut stones, suitably marked, may be set into the ground for the purpose. \Vhen a mark is to be established on brick buildings a copper or brass bolt, about 10 centimet11rs long and ~ centimeters in diameter, should be set horizontally into a hole drilled into the center of a brick, and adjacent bricks should be ma.rked with the letters U.S. B. M. Bench-marks of cities and such as relate to water courses near which the line of levels passes should be connected with the latter, and when a railroad is crossed the elevation of the foot of the rail should be observed. The frequency of permanent benches must depend in a measure upon the opportunities offered b:y the country through which the line p~sses, but cannot be too great. Permanent benches may again be subdivided into primary and secondary. The distance apart of temporary benches should be about 1 kilometer, both as a safeguard against errors ancl for the comparison of the relative accuracy of the work on different lines. It should be remembered that whenever a bench-mark is to be connected, on which the foot of the rod cannot be placed, the distance between the foot of the rod and the zero of its graduation must be taken into account, and that of the other rod also, if the line does not end with same rod with which it was begun.
DEGREE OF PRECISION.

The rule, based on experience, adopted for the "Europaische Gradmessung" in 1867, is that the probable error of a difforence in height of two points 1 kilometer apart should not, in general, exceed 3mm, and never r,mm, The Jlrobable error deduced from the closure of polygons is, in general, however, smaller than the amounts abo\'e given, a circumstance which may be 1mrtly ascribed to the fact that greater accuracy is attainable, and partly to the compensation, in long lines, of cumulative errors, which experience has shown to exist at times, and the nnture of which has not. been satisfactorily explained. As a guide, the observer may therefore accept for short distances a difference, d, between two levelings of the distance K, in kilometers, expressed by the formula d = 5mm ../ ~K.
RECORDS ilD COMPUTATIONS.

A detailed description of every bench-mark and of it.s exact and general locality should be ·ntered in a book kept for the purpose, and a general map, showing the line leveled and the location of the benches, must accompany the record of each season's work. Explicit information in regard to everything having a bearing on the accuracy of the work, such as the times and manner of adjusting the instrument and rods, the strength of the wind, the condition of the ground, and the location of the instrument and rods while observing, whether on river or ranal embankments, or on roads or fields, should be entered in the field book of observations either between stations or at the end of each day's work. A specimen of the record of observations is appended. It shows also as much of theoompnt.ation as is performed in the observing book. The means of the micrometer pointings on horizon and

target and their difference, H - T, are computed and written down, as well as the difference between the distance wire and the mean of readings on the upper and lower edge of the target. A specimen of the computation and abstract is also appended. In the form for computations the left-hand page refers to backsights, and the first column contains the number of the stations. The second column contains the argument, or space in centimeters, read off on the rod by the di:stance threads, and the next column the corresponding distance in meters. The fourth column contains the differences between the means of the micrometer readings on horizon and target. The three following columns, under the bead of "corrections," contain the corrections there indicated, expressed in millimeters, which are summed up in the eighth column, and applied to the sum of the rod readings, the :result forming the corrected rod readings. The same remarks apply to the right-hand page, which is devoted to foresights, and which, in addition, contains a column giving the difference between the sums of the back and the fore sights, or the difference in height of the benches. To this difference the temperature correction, derived from the mean of the recorded temperatures, is yet to be applied. In order t.o facilitate the computations, tables are prepared for each instrument, giving for the argument derived from the distance threads, the interred distances, the corresponding linear values of micromeoor divisions, and the correction for inequality of pi\Tots. Curvature and refraction.-A table of corrections for cunTature and refraction for different di$tances is appended. The curvature is computed by the formula

~~'

where d is the distance

and r the radius of curvature of the earth for a line making an angle of 45° with the meridian in latitude 330, equal to 6373 kilometers. The quantities are so small, however, that a mean radius of 6370 kilometers may equally well be used. The effect of refraction is at best a very variable quantity; it is taken here as the eighth part of the correction for curvature, corresponding very nearly t.o Gauss's coefficient. The values in the table correspond, therefore, to the formula
d'!7d d 2r (l - 0·125) or 8 2r = 14568000·

As a convenient approximate rule we may take: correction

OBSERVATIONS TO DETERMINE THE REFRACTION ON LINES PASSING NEAR A SURFACE OF WATER, , MADE AT DIFFERENT ELEVATIONS ACROSS THE POTOMAC RIVER. REPORT BY ANDREW BRAID, ASSISTANT.

U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

Washingtoti, D. C., June 6, 1881. Sm: In accordance with verbal instructions from yourself and the Assistant in Charge of tbe Office, a series of observations have been made by Mr. J. B. Weir and myself for the determination of the coefficient of refraction over water at different elevations. The place selected for the observations was at Georgetown, D. C., the station on tbe north bank of the river being about 150 meters, and that on tl1e south bank about 700 meters above the "Aqueduct Bridge." The length of the sights varies from 658 to 670 meters (distance determined by triangulation), and the elevations above the water from 4 to li feet. The instruments used were geodesic micrometer levels Nos. 3 and 2, the former being used by Mr. Weir and the latter by me. Care was taken in every instance to have the two instruments at very nearly the same elevation above the surface of the water, and the sights in opposite direc· tions observed simultaneously. After observing a series for each elevation the observers exchanged stations, but each retained his own instrument. Then a double series for each elevation wss observed and stations again exchanged, &c. In the reduction of the observations, corrections are applied for inclination, inequality of pivots, and earth's curvature, and half the remaining difference between any two simultaneous sights is assumed to be the error <lue to refraction. The errors due to inaccuracy of pointing are probably quite small, as the seeing was excellent, and the mean of a number of pointings (12to16) was taken in ea-0h case. In the accompanying tabulation the results are arranged in three groups: for lower, middle, and upper elevation. It will be seen that the values for the coefficient derived are, as in our previous experience on the Mississippi River, large, and especially for the lower elevation; but, curiously enough, the upper-elevation observations girn a larger value than that derived from the middle elevation. Contrary to expectation also, the refraction seems to increase rapidly with the time, being less between 9 and 10.30 a. m. than at any subsequent 1ieriod of the observations. This peculiar circumstance, which may, perhaps, be dui:i chiefly to increase of temperature, is more noticeable on the lower elevation, but is common to the others also, the only exceptions being found in stations 13, 21, 3, and 28. The mean value of the coefficient of refraction for the lower elevation is 0.378, for the middle elevation, 0.264, and for the upper ele\·ation, 0,293. That but little error can be due to personal equation, or any difference in instruments, is shown by an examination of determined relative heights of the bench-marks on opposite sides of the river. Benchmarks "a" and "b" are on north side, and 1 and 2 on south side of river. Middle and upper elevation observations give mean difforences of height of bench-marks, 2 and b (2 being the higher), as om.8029 and 0 .8034, respectively, values which are almost iden· tical. Now, if we select the observations of either observer (or, what is the same thing in this case, of either instrument), and compute them, independently of the simultaneous observations of the other observer, we get results differing only Omm.8 from those above given. Also th· mean of all the lower elevations gives bench.mark 1 higher than bench-mark a =0111 .5276, and either observer's observations computed independently gives result differing only 2mm,3 from this mean. The lower-elevation results, however, give a difference of height of bench-marks 2 and b of
01

om.7800, or om.0231 less than derived from middle and upper elevations. This difference I cannot account for. The inequality of pivots, being an important factor in these observations, has been redetermined for both instruments, and the present values used in this computation. Yours, respectfully, ANDREW BRAID, Assistant. CARLILE P. PATTERSON, Superintendent.
