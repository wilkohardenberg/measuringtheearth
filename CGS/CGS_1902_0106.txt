D. B. Wainwright, Assistant, Oct. 25 to Jan. 31. W. D. Chilton, Ger/.:. II. M. Fitch, Confidential Clerk. THE WORK OF THE YEAR.

Full details of the work of the year are given in the following pages, and they will show that gratifying progress w'as made in all directions in work devolved on the Sur\'ey. This is true of the work along new lines, as well as of the resurve.ys which are made necessary by the constant changes of the coast line and of the depths in rivers, harbors, and ocean bars, the increase in tlie draft of ships, and by the addition of new features continually added by commercial and other developments. 'rhrough the cooperation of the Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army, this Survey is enabled to make full use of the \'aluable information obtained of changes occurring in waters which are being improved by the Engineer Corps. It is the policy of this Bureau to utilize to the fullest extent possible all available sources of informaticm, and thus to avoid duplication of work. Especial attention is called to the great progress made in the Philippine Islands under the able direction of Assistant George R. Putnam. The regions in which work was done are briefly recapitulated as follo\Ys: Astronomic determinations were made in Alaska, Massachusetts, on the Northwest Boundary, in Ohio, the Philippine Islands, and \Visconsin. Base lines were measured in Alaska and the Philippine Islands. Coast Pilot work was done in California, Maine, Maryland, Oregon, Philippine Islands, Virginia, and Washington. Hydrographic work was done in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, South Carolina, Virginia, and \Vashingtou. Leveling work was done in Alabama, Indian Territory, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma Territory, Texas, and Wyoming. Magnetic Observations were 1iiade in Alaska, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland; New Mexico, on the Nortln'l'est Boundary, in

Oklahoma Territory, Pennsylvania, Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. Reconnaissance work in Alaska, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Kew York, Ohio, Oregon, Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, South Carolina, Virginia, \Vashington, and Wisconsin. Tide Observations were made in California, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, New York, Philippine Islands, and Washington. Topographic work was done in Alaska, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, Virginia, and Washington. Triangulation was done in Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Indian Territory, Kansas, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma Territory, Ohio, Oregon, Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. In March two observing parties and a signal-building party were organized for work under one chief on the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian, and the work proceeded with unequaled speed and economy, compared with the primary triangulation previously executed. Twenty-eight stations were occupied before the close of the fiscal year. Details concerning this work and the instructions under ,vhich the observations were made can be found in Appendix I to this Report.
APPLICATION OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.

The development of wireless telegraph systems during the year rendered it important that experiments should be made to determine whether it was practicable to use the wireless telegraph for the purpose of exchanging time signals in the longitude work of the Sun1ey. The importance of a successful wireless telegraph system to a chart-making organization ·like the Coast and Geodetic Survey can be understood when it is remembered that the method of determining longitude by lunar distances is unsatisfactory from the standpoint of accuracy and that by the chronometric method the cost of a longitude determination increases with the increased cost of travel between stations, and its accuracy decreases as the time required to make a round trip increases. It has been customary in Alaska to obtain the results from seven round trips of a steamer for the determination of the difference of longitude between important stations. The errors pertaining to the two preceding methods are either abolished or reduced to a minimum by the telegraphic method. It meets all modern requirements for accuracy and is comparatively inexpensive. Unfortunately for the accurate and rapid construction of charts, telegraph lines and cables do not penetrate everywhere. Alaska is largely devoid of telegraph facilities, and yet a large fleet of vessels now annually traverses its coasts en route to the gold fields, and the charts by which they are navigated have depended for longitude on the older, slower, and less exact methods. In view of these conditions, when Marconi's system of wireless telegraphy was made public, it was almost immediately realized that here was an opportunity for expanding the American method, and that it promised the means for rapidly extending exact determinations to the remote points of our maritime possessions.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

Experimental work in the laboratory was at once taken up, more however for the idea of obtaining familiarity with the apparatus and its manipulation than with the expectation of making actual use of it in the field, since it had not reached that stage of development which would permit of having stations far enough apart to 1pake its · adoption an economical success. It may be stated here that the requirements to be met by the system for longitude work are far less than those for commercial or military purposes. Interference from the apparatus is not likely, as its use will be confined to unsettled regions. The speed with which messages can be sent or receh·ed or whether multiplex apparatus can be used, is of no moment from our standpoint. Granting that with a suitable distance between two astronomic stations a few messages can be interchanged consisting of inquiries and replies as to the progress of the astronomic work, and also the interchange of a few sets of arbitrary signals, each set only occupying a minute's time, and the necessary conditions are fulfilled. In October, 1901, the experiments were given a wider scope. 'l'hrough the courtesy of the New York Herald the facilities afforded by the Herald's wireless telegraph station on Nantucket Island were utilized. The station is situated on the southeast end of the island, and is provided with a set of Marconi instruments. Forty-eight miles distant in a southerly direction is the anchorage of the Nantucket Shoal light-ship, which is also provided with a Marconi apparatus. The experiments at the shore station consisted in simulating the essential conditions of a field telegraph station and obtaining a record of the customary time signals. Covering the period of the experimental work on Nantucket Island, time observations were made with a sextant and artificial horizon, and the data obtained for computing a difference of longitude which, though rough, is probably the first determination by · wireless telegraph. In June additional tests of the Marconi wireless telegraph apparatus were made, the tests being made possible by the lil;>erality of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America, which furnished an operator and apparatus for the cost of its· installation on board the Survey schooner .Cagre. The tests were made between the Marconi wireless telegraph station at Sagaponack on the eastern end of Long Island, New York, and the Eagre at various distances. The Eagre established easy communication with the shore station and then proceeded away from it to determine how far this particular form of apparatus was available for sending such signals as are used in longitude work. The experiments were in progress at the close of the fiscal year.
INTERNATIONAL LATITUDE SERVICE.

Satisfactory results were obtained at the astronomical observatories under the direc. tion of the Survey at the expense of the International Geodetic Association at Gaithersburg, Md., and Ukiah, Cal., for the purpose of determining the variations of latitude.
SPECIAL DUTY.

One officer continued to serve as a member of the Mississippi River Commission and another continued on duty retracing and remarking Mason and Dixon's Line, under an ·assignment requested by the States of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Two officers con-

tinued to serve as members of a commission appointed by the United States Supreme Court to retrace and mark the boundary line between the States of Tennessee and Virgn11a. Other officers represented the. Survey in charge of the ·exhibit at the PanAmerican Exposition at Buffalo, N. Y., and at the West Indian Exposition at Charleston, S. C. The speed-trial course in Delaware Bay was re-marked and the length of the Cape Cod speed-trial course was verified at the request and at the expense of the ship builders for whom they were established. A special anchorage survey was made off the mouth of the Withlacooche River for the Dunnellon Phosphate Company at the expense of the company. Details in regard to the field work of the year can be found in Appendix No. 1 to this Report. The appropriations for the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey on account of the fiscal year of 1902 amounted to $832 845. Of this amount the sum of $210 245 was for the pay of officers and men to man and equip the vessels of the Survey, and $54 600 for the repairs and maintenance of the vessels. The sum of $34 500 was for Office expenses, including the installation of a new electrotyping plant. The remainder of' the appropriation was about equally divided between expenses of parties in the field and salaries of the field and Office forces. The statement of expenditures during the year is given on pp. 26-51.

The usua.l work in the Office \vas continued. The work of reducing the geographic positions in southeast Alaska from the head of Lynn Canal to Port Simpson, begun in the previous year, was completed. The computation of the primary triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian, from the thirty-ninth parallel northward to the Page Base in Nebraska, was completed. The work of reducing the triangulation by the U. S. Lake Survey from western New York to the Olney Base.in Illinois and along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River to conformity with the triangulation by the Coast and Geodetic Survey already computed upon the United States Standard Datum, was completed. Four appendixes, on the measurement of base lines along the ninety-eighth meridian, on the extension of tables for the computation of geodetic positions to the equator, on the determination of the relative values of gravity in Europe and in the United States, and on the results of the triangulation northward along the ninety-eighth meridian, were prepared for the Annual Report for 1901. A new chart showing the lines of equal magnetic declination and equal annual change was completed. The United States Declination Tables and Isogonic Charts for 1902 was prepared for publication. The volume of Tide Tables for 1903 was prepared for publication. The drawings for 20 new charts were completed. Three original copperplates for new charts were completed. Nine hundred and fifty-nine plates were corrected for printing and 68 963 impressions were made from the copperplates. Editions of 32 new charts, 3 I printed by photolithography and 1 from copperplate, were issued. Forty-eight new editions of charts, 34 printed from copperplate and 14 by photolithography, were also issued.

The records of the assignment of all officers to the vessels of the Survey, the enlistments and discharges of the men, and of all changes i\1 rates of pay .are kept in the Office of the Inspector of Hydrography and Topography, and he exercises personal supervision over the construction of vessels and the making- of repairs, in addition to inspecting the work of the parties at work in the field whenever necessary. Numerous short trips of inspection of construction and repairs were necessary during the year to various points on the Atlantic coast where such work was in progress. The pay rolls of the enlisted men on the ships were examined and certified as to the time of enlistment and the rate of pay, and other routine work of the Office was kept up to date. The general work of the Coast Pilot party in the field and Office also falls under his direction. During the year the progress made in revising the Coast Pilot publications has been most satisfactory, and it is believed that within another year this important work will have fully recovered from the interruptions occasioned by the withdra\val of the naval officers at .the outbreak of the Spanish war. The following general statement concerning the vessels and the hydrographic and topographic work of the year is taken from the report of the Inspector. No work in the Philippine Islands, except the work of the Pathfinder, is included in this statement: THE VESSELS AND THEIR HYDROGRAPHIC WORK.
THE STEAMER BACH!;.

On July 1, 1901, this vessel was at the shipyard of the Townsend & Downey Shipbuilding Company, Shooters Island, New York Harbor, where she had been sent in December, 1900, to be rebuilt. The company built a new hull of composite construction for this ship on designs drawn under the supervision of the Inspector by Mr. L. B. Friendt, of Baltimore, Md. A new boiler was also supplied, but the machinery and equipments from the old ship were transferred into the new hull.

16

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1902.

The new hull was launched on September 21 and the vessel was accepted from the contractors on January 18 and left the yard on February 28, under the command of Assistant P. A. \Velker, who had joined the ship on December 18 to take charge of the outfitting of the vessel preparatory to her sea trial trip. She sailed from New York on March 3 and arrived in Baltimore a few days later. Some minor alterations were made to the machinery while in Baltimore, and on April 14 she sailed for the Gulf of Mexico to conduct a hydrographic examination of the west pass of Appalachicola Bay and the entrance to St. Andrews Sound. Great changes had been reported at both of these localities, and sufficient workwas secured to correct the charts for the purposes of navigation. The vessel returned to Baltimore on June 19 and was at that port at the close of the year.

On July 1 this vessel was at Baltimore refitting for work on the New England coast, having but recently returned from Porto Rico. She sailed for Hyannisport, Mass., on July 14, under the temporary command of Assistant 0. B. French, to make hydrographic examinations required by the Navy Department in connection with the maneuvers of the fleet in that locality. Her first work was the development of the Cross Rip Channel, south of the Horse Shoe, which was completed by the time that the fleet reached there. Assistant P. A. Welker relieved Assistant French of the command of the vessel on August 10 and subsequently made a hydrographic survey of the eastern entrance to the Sound, passing Great Point. This survey, compared with the work of 1895, shows that no material change has taken place. It is pleasing to note that on the conclusion of the maneuvers of the fleet a complimentary letter was transmitted to the Office by Admiral Higginson, referring to the assistance rendered him by the Blake during the season. On the conclusion of her work in Nantucket Sound the Blake started on her return to Baltimore, but stopped on the way to make examinations of reported dangers at Quicks Hole and Robinsons Hole, and also dangers at the eastern entrance of Long Island Sound and localities along the north shore of the Sound. She arrived at Baltimore on September 30 and was immediately put under repairs to strengthen her hull for the winter's cruise in Porto Rico. On December 14 Assistant.R. L. Faris relieved Assistant \Velker of the command of the ship, and on December 21 she sailed for San Juan, P. R. She left San Juan on June 3 and arrived at Baltimore on the 10th, and remained there until the close of the fiscal year. Her work in Porto Rican waters comprised the development of the southeast end of the island from Point Fignras to Ensenada Honda, the limit of the work of the schooner Eagre during the preceding winter. She extended her work eastward and northward in Vieques Sound to the vicinity of Port Mnlas. Later in the season, on the west coast of the island, a thorough hydrographic survey was made of Mayaguez Harbor. The hydrography of the east coast of the island has now been plotted and shows a passage around this end of the island of 5 fathoms in the channel along the shore. By

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

passing to the westward of Palominos and Outer Piraguas Rock, thence northward of the Mosquito Shoals and Arenas Point Sands, on the western end of Vieques Island, a practicable channel can be buoyed with a least depth of 6 fathoms. A number of new. ledges with a depth of less than 3 fathoms were discovered between Vieques Island and the main island approaching from the southward, and some shoaler soundings were obtained in the development of localities where the soundings indicated shoals or dangers in the work of the schooner Eagre of the previous year.
THE SCHOONER EAGRE.

This ship sailed from Baltimore on July 1, Assistant J. B. Boutelle commanding, arriving at Shooters Island on the 7th, where she was engaged in completing a hydrographic survey of the Kill von Kull in that vicinity. On August 9 she moved to Peekskill to continue a revision of the work in that . locality. On October 25 she closed work on the Hudson River and reported at the Erit: Basin, Brooklyn, where she was refitted with a new set of rigging that had been ordered earlier in the season. While in the basin the party determined the J?ositions of several of the beacons in the lower harbor, and an examination was made to determine the extreme end of Sandy Hook, which had been reported as having been greatly extended. On January 18 she sailed for Oxford, Md., and took up the hydrographic survey of the Choptank River. On June 17 she sailed again for New York to take part in the experiments to test the applicability of the Marconi system of wireless telegraphy in the transmission of time for telegraphic longitude work. These experimeuts were in progress at the close of the fiscal year.
THE STEA:\IER ENDEAVOR.

At the beginning of the year this vessel, Assistant F. A. Young commanding, was engaged in a hydrographic examination of the lower Chesapeake Bay. The great amount of work that would be required to thoroughly resurvey Chesapeake Bay led to the suggestion to run experiniental lines in the main bay to detern1ine if radical changes had taken place in the depths, necessitating a resurvey. A section of the bay behveen Thomas Point and the mouth of the Potomac River had been examined, with this end in view, two seasons before, and it proved so highly satisfactory in demonstrating that the greater depths of the bay had not suffered any material change that similar work . was taken up on the lower bay as soon as the triangulation points had been furnished. The lines run are generally about three miles apart, both across and up and down the bay, and, when plotted in combination with the hydrographic sheets of the original survey, form an excellent check upon the old work. The result bas been most gratifying, and clearly demonstrated that the deep-water channels represented by the original surveys have not changed in either location or depth. Incidentally the comparison develops a number of interesting facts. Depressions or boles of slightly greater depth than the surrounding areas, and also lumps or isofated shoals, crossed by the new lines, have almost invariably been found the same as represented by the original work. 10515-03--2

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1902.

Many of the new lines have crossed the 3-fathom curve of the shoals extending out trom the shore, showing that this curve wherever it has been checked has not changed. The large erosions from the shores of the bay, which became apparent when the shore line was rerun, have cast a mass of material into the bay that might reasonably ha\·e been expected to have accumulated and perhaps formed into new shoals, but up to this time no discovery has been made of a locality in the lower bay where there has been a new deposit. In the hays and creeks some changes have been noted, but none of them of a material nature. Eastern Bay was resurveyed with a great deal of care, and the reduction represents the channels without substantial change and but slight changes on the shore. This examination by the Endeavor was completed on December 19 and the ship returned to Baltimore to be overhauled. She was opened out and inspected by the United States local inspector, in company with the Inspector of Hydrography and Topography, with most gratifying results. Her frames were discovered to be in excellent condition, but it was deemed advisable to refasten her below the water line and then remetal her. On March 17 she sailed for the Kettle Bottoms, on the Potomac River, to make a thorough resun-ey of that locality, but on April 5 this work was suspended and she was ordered to Barren Island to furnish facilities for Assistant D. B. \Vainwright to reerect the water signals of the speed trial course, as had been requested by the Secretary of the Navy. This work was completed oi1 the 21st, when the ship returned to her headquarters at Colonial Beach, Va. A~ the close of the year she was still engaged upon a survey of the Kettle Bottoms.
THE STEA:\!ER HYDROGRAPHER.

This vessel was built by the James Reilly Repair and Supply Company of New York City, under plans furnished by this Office. She is a wooden vessel, has triple expansion engines and Roberts boiler. She registers 79 tons. The ship was launched from the yard of James E. Bayles, at Port Jefferson, N. Y., on September 25 and left that port on October 2 for New York City, making a satisfactory trial trip on the way and developing a speed of 11 knots. Mr. John Ross, nautical expert, was assigned to command her. He completed her outfitting in New York, and she was accepted from the contractor on November 6, sailing for Chesapeake Bay the next day. She immediately entered upon a field revision of Part VI of the Atlantic Coast Pilot, covering Chesapeake Bay. This work was completed by January 15, w.hen she arrived at Baltimore and was refitterl for a cruise on the south Atlantic coast. On January r 7, 1902, Assistant F. F. \Veld relieved Mr. Ross of tl1e command of. the ship, and on February 1 r sailed· for the South. During the season a hydrographic survey was made of the bar at Sapelo Sound, Georgia, and an examination of the main channel into St. Helena Sound. These surveys were completed by May 14, when she returned north and reported at \Vashington on May 20, and was immediately refitted for Coast Pilot work on the 1\·ew England coast. Mr. Ross was again assigned to the command, and on June 2 she sailed from Washington for Eastport,' Me., arriving there on the 25th, and immediately began a revision of Parts I and II of the Atlantic Coast Pilot, upon which work the ship was engaged at the close of the fiscal year.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.
THE SCHOONER MATCHLESS.

On July 1 this vessel, Assistant George L. Flower, commanding, was in Baltimore refitting, having but recently returned from a season's· operations in Porto Rico. She sailed for Tangier Sound, on the lower Chesapeake Bay, on August 19, and was engaged in a general survey of the Sound, including triangulation, hydrography, and topography, until the close of the fiscal year.
THE STEAMER GEDNEY.

At the beginning of the fiscal year this ship was engaged in a survey of Icy Strait, Alaska, in conjunction with the steamer Patterson, including shore-line and hydrography. She closed field work on October 17, sailing for Seattle, Wash., and arrived there on November 1. On December 5 Assistant J. F. Pratt relieved Assistant Dickins of the command of the ship, and on the 17th the ship was put out of commission. She was delivered at the yard of Moran Brothers, Seattle, on the 28th of the following March for the installation of the new boiler that had been built for her during the winter. She was put in commission again on the 1st of June and preparations were made for work in Alaska.
THE STEA~mR ~!'ARTHUR.

This vessel, Assistant F. \Vestdahl, commanding, was on her working grounds in the vicinity of Sannak Islands, Alaska, at the beginning of the fiscal year, engaged upon triangulation, topography, and hydrography in conjunction with the steamer Patlifinder. She closed work on October 1 and sailed for Seattle, via Juneau, joining the Patterson and Gedney at the latter place, and thus enabling all three of the vessels to return to Seattle with one pilot. On :November 23 she arrived at Oakland, Cal., and was put out of commission on November 30. The necessary repairs were made to the vessel during the winter, and on May 1 she was again put in commission. She sailed for her working grounds in Prince William Sound on May 30, arriving at Orea on June 30.
THE STEAMER PATTERSOX.

On July 1 this ship, Assistant J. F. Pratt, commanding, was at work in Cross Sound and Icy Strait, S. E. Alaska, carrying forward the triangulation, topography, and hydrography. \York was completed for the season on October 10 and she sailed for Seattle, via Juneau, arriving at Seattle on October 3i. She was then laid up in ordinary, pending arrangements for extensh·e repairs, and was put out of commission on December 31. The repairs under the coutract with Moran Brothers Company, of s.eattle, were commenced in March and completed before the close of the fiscal. year. This ship had developed a structural weakness during her cruise to Bering Sea in the summer of 1900 · that had rendered her unfit to return to these waters until she bad been materially strengthened. The repairs consisted essentially of renewing the main deck waterways, covering board, and the main and spar decks with heavier material; also the installation

·of spar-deck shelving all around the ship and thwart ship bulkheads of iron plating. A new boiler that had been built for the ship during the previous summer was also installed and her engines thoroughly overhauled. On May 26 the vessel was again put in commission and preparations were made for work in Alaska.
THE STEAMER PATHFINDER.

On July r this ship, Assistant J. J. Gilbert, commanding, was on her working -grounds in the vicinity of Dutch Harbor, Alaska, where she was engaged in making a survey of the Fox Island Passes, including the triangulation, topography, and hydrography. The work of the season rectified many errors of position in the shore lines, and in conjunction with the work of the steamer J7£cArtlmr afforded material for the publi-cation of a new chart extending from Dutch Harbor to the Sannak Islands, of much greater accuracy than those heretofore published. On October 7 she sailed from ·Dutch Harbor for Manila, P. I., via Yokohama and Nagasaki, arriving at Manila· on November r8, and immediately began the work of -correcting the charts of the Philippine Islands. On April 12 she sailed from Manila to Amoy, China, for a general overhauling. While at this place an ice plant that had been sent from New York \Vas installed in the ship, and also new motive power in the launches. The ship returned to Manila on May 26, and on June 6 sailed for San Bernardino Straits to make a survey of that locality. During the .season in the Philippines the most important surveys made were at Rornblon, Cebu, San Bernardino, and Orrnoc.
THE STEAMER TAKU.

This vessel was assigned for the convenience of the party of Assistant Ritter, and was at work under his command on July r in Prince William Sound, Alaska. A gasoline launch was also employed by him under contract. He closed his field work in October and resumed operations in the spring of 1902, utilizing the Taku as before, and a steam launch that had been sent from San Francisco to take the place of the gasoline launch.
THE TOPOGRAPHIC WORK.

The principal topographic work executed during the year was on the eastern shore of Chesape9ke Bay, completing the shore line southward to the Maryland-Virginia boundary line, to meet requisitions from the Geological Survey of the State of Maryland and the United States Geological Survey. Five parties were employed on this work during the summer, including the party on the schooner Matcliless, and by the beginning of the cold weather all of the work requested had been completed. The work was continued during the winter by a party under Assistant Stehrnan Forney, filling in the margin of the topography to the same limit. Assistant John Nelson completed the topographic survey in the vicinity of Portsmouth, N. H., and in the fall of the year proceeded to Porto Rico, where he continued the triangulation and topography on the north shore of the island from San Juan to San Juan Head, the extreme northeastern point.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

The party on the Blake during the same time filled in the gap at the southeastern end of the island, thus completing the shore line· of the whole group, with the exception of the islands in Mona Passage. In Alaska, a large part of the shore line of Icy Strait and Cross Sound was obtained by the parties on the Patterson and Gedney, and Assistant Ritter extended his work of the previous year in Prince William Sound to cover Valdes Arm, the northern extremity of the Sound.

THE COAST PILOT WORK.

The preparation and revision of the Coast Pilot has continued during the year under the immediate supervision of Mr. John Ross, nautical expert. Field work was done in Chesapeake Bay with the steamer Hydrographer, as before mentioned, and an examination was made of the Pacific coast by Mr. Harry L. Ford, nautical expert, from San Diego, Cal., to and including Puget Sound. As there was no vessel available for the work north of San Francisco, Mr. Ford had to resort to such means of transportation as were locally available. This retarded the work very much, but nevertheless afforded a sufficient opportunity for a very careful scrutiny of the coast to ascertain the essential changes that had taken place. The steamer HJ1drographer, in charge of Mr. Ross, left Washington about the 1st of June for a field revision of the Coast Pilot volumes covering the New England coast, as far south as Narragansett Bay. · In conclusion the Inspector expresses his appreciation of the hearty cooperation that he received from the chiefs of the field parties in carrying out the details of the superintendent's directions. . He also calls special attention to the loyal assistance rendered him by the Coast Pilot party and the clerical force of his office.

United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VI, Chesapeake Bay and Tributaries was~revised from the notes made in the field and office, and on March 4 the copy for the second edition of this volume was sent to the printer. A new edition of Bulletin No. 40, relating to Bering Sea and the Arctic coasts of Alaska was revised, brought up to date, and prepared for the printer. The proof of these publications was read and ordered printed. The charts of the region covered by Bulletin No. 40 were compared with Geographic Dictionary of Alaska and corrected, so that in all new charts the spelling will be uniform. The preparation of the fifth edition of the Pacific Coast Pilot, California, Oregon and Washington, was begun and about one-fourth completed before June 30. The necessary material was collected and preparations were made for the revision of Parts I-II and III of the United States Coast Pilot Atlantic Coast. The routine work of the party in keeping a record of all changes, reported dangers to navigation, hydrographic examinations, and new information for use in the compilation, revision, and correction of Coast Pilot volumes, and the correction of these yolmnes to elate of issue by the Office, required much time and constant attention. A supplement to United States Coast Pilot, Part VII, Chesapeake Bay entrance to Key \Vest, was prepared and sent to the printer. The following officers were on field duty during the year, as stated:
John Ross, nautical expert, September 24 to January 17, :\fay 27 to June 30. H. C. Gra\·es, nautical expert, October 30 to January 17, June 1 to June 30. H. L. Ford, nautical expert, July I to :\larch 9. T. 0. Pulizzi, writer, November 12 to January 17.

The account of the work performed by them while on duty in the field is gi\·en in Appendix r to this report. III. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR OF GEODETIC WORK.

J. F.

l-IAYI'OR!l,

I11spcdor o/ Geodetic 11-'or!.:.

The duties of the Inspector of Geodetic \Vork were performed at the Office in Washington, and only two trips to the field on inspection were necessary during the year. The duties consisted in a careful examination of all correspondence "·ith officers in the field on this subject and an examination of all records and computations of obser\'ations made i1ilthe field and transmitted to the Office. On January 25 Assistant Hayford left \Vashington and proceeded to Clarks Hill, S. C., where the triangulation party under the direction of Assistant Fairfield was at work, for the purpose of testing the action of the acetylene signal lamps which had been prepared for use in making obsen·ations at night. Four triangulation stations are visible from Clarks Hill, namely, ).kKnight, Bunce, \Villiams, and Lincoln Mountain, and the distance to these stations ranges between r 2 and 30 miles. The following is quoted from the report of Assistant Hayford:
On the 27th the first part of the evening was clear anrl three of the four signal lights showed, namely, at McKnight, \\'illiams, and Lincoln Mountain. The light on Uncoln :\fountain, distant about 30 miles, was visible to the unaided eye most of the time for three hours, after which time it

REPORT OF THE

SUPERINTE~DE"'T.

23

disappeared, apparently shut out by rain. All three lights were splendid objects for telescopic pointings during the whole time they were visible. The manner in which the lights showed on this evening indicates that they are sufficiently powerful· to be used as signal lights in triangulation, and that the accuracy of the pointing required is not so great as to require special skill in tending them. The three lights seen had all been posted by compass bearings only, and a study of the lights at close range indicates that it is not necessary to point it as accurately e\·en as a heliotrope. The various tests which have been made by Assistant Fairfield's party as to steadiness and reliability of the light and the ease with which it may be kept in operation, and similar tests which had heretofore been made at the Office, indicate that the acetylene lights are fully satisfactory. I feel justified, therefore, in recommending that a sufficient number of these acetylene lights be made for use in the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation.

On March 25 Assistant Hayford again left \Vashington and proceeded to Bowie, Tex., for the purpose of inspecting the triangulation and leveling work in progress in the vicinity. In order to know accurately how the field work was being done, to test proposed plans and to illustrate them, he took part in the work of each chief of party visited, such as obserdng, computing, and instructing the light keepers. The two triangulation parties, the signal-building party, and the leveling party were each visited at such times as would most conveniently serve the purpose in view. The work of the triangulation parties was slow at first on account of lack of experience and other causes, but a more perfect organization was rapidly effected, and an unequaled output of work for the season was the result. The following is quoted from the report of Assistant Hayford:
The leveling party under Aid \V. H. Burger had completed 35 miles of le\·eling at the end of their first two weeks of ohseryation. The party usually lea\·es the boarding house at about 7 a. 111. and reaches it again at 5 p. 111., and a full hour is taken for lunch in the middle of the day. The rapid progress indicated abo\·e is, therefore, not d!1e to Jong hours of work. \Vith the form of precise le\·el now in use it is necessary that the telescope should conform nearly to the condition that when the eye end is moved in or out to focus the telescope the motion of the middle horizontal line of the diaphragm shall be a straight line passing through the optical· center of the objective. Theoretical considerations and shop tests had indicated that this condition was fulfilled with more than necessary accuracy. In order, howe\·er, to lea\·e no doubt in regard to this matter, a s1)'ecial series of 30 readings were macle on the forenoon of April q, following a scheme especially devised to bring out the error due to the cause indicate1l aho\·e. The test was repeated in the afternoon of the same day. These sixty-rod readings, taken wi'.h the rods at distances of from 5 to 95 meters from the instrument, and furnishing 6 determinations of the relath·e heights of 10 points, agreed so closely after correction by the usual field method for curvature and refraction and for "C," the constant of the instrument, that it is impassible to prO\·e from them that the motion of the eye end is not perfect. It is certain that the departure from perfection in this particular instrument in this respect is so slight that the errors introduced into the results hy assuming '' C" a constant, even if the difference between fore and back sight is allowed to he as great as 70 to go meters, is very small as compared with the accidental errors of ohscn·ation. ln the actual Je,·eling no foresight is allowed to differ from the corresponding back sight by more than IO meters, and errors from this cause are co~respondingly small.

Personal inspection of the field work in Kansas and Texas was made between July 25 and August 8, and the work at the Cheltenham Observatory was inspected every month as occasion re.quired. The inspector was at the Baldwin, Kans., Observatory from July 27 to August r. The cause of some erratic values obtained from observations made with magnetometer No. 3 was finally traced to the four brass screws which \Vere used to attach the sides of the wooden suspension box. These were found to have magnetic properties which indicated that the brass of which they were made was not wholly free from particles of iro1i-. Special instructions were given to one of the magnetic observers temporarily attached to the observatory at Baldwin, and the inspector then proceeded to Texas and inspected the work of the parties in that State. The entire activity in the work in the field may be briefly summarized as follO\vs: The determination of the absolute value of the magnetic elements was made in 191 different localities embracing 201 stations, 21 of which were in localities previously occupied, distributed over 15 States and Territories, and in British Colun~bia, as shown in the following table:

The two new magm-tic observatories, one at Sitka, Alaska, and the other near Honolulu, H. I., were completed, and the observatory work, involving continuous registration of the 1.1agnetic variations and the determination of the absolute elements was inat ·ui ed at Sitka on Noveinber 25, 1901, and at Honolulu Observatory on January 1, l 2 The expense involved in the construction of these observatories necessarily cur. Lto some extent the extension of the magnetic survey of the country. Conti1 t 1s registration of the magnetic variations at the magnetic observatories situated at ;:: 1eltenham, Md., and Baldwin, Kans., was obtained throughout the year, and determmations of the absolute elements were made at intervals of one week.

The four magnetic observatories participated in the international work on the rst and r 5th of each month after January r, I 902. Magnetic occurrences of special interest and importance were recorded at the four observatories at various times, and especially in connection with the numerous earthquakes toward the end of the fiscal year, and the volcanic eruptions in the island of Martinique. A special study of these in connection with the observations made during the same period at foreign observatories, copies of which have been courteously furnished, will be made. V.

The disbursement of the funds of the Coast and Geodetic Survey is made 'not 'Only by payments directly from the Disbursing Agent, but also largely through the medium of its Assistants and other officers when acting as chiefs of parties. These officers, on approval of the Superintendent, receive advances of public funds from tbe Disbursing Agent in lump sums, under authority of an Executive order dated March 26, 1886. In conformity to this order there are now 56 officers of this Survey bonded in the sum of $2 ooo or more each. When acting as chiefs of parties these officers receive from time to time such advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent as are required to meet the necessary current expenses of the work in hand. A ledger account is kept in the office of the Disbursing Agent with each chief of party receiving an advance, each one being charged with all advances made to him, and, on the other hand, receiving credit for all proper expenditures made by him when presented on regularly supported vouchers after such accounts h<J.ve been audited in the office of the Disbursing Agent and found to be correct. All of these accounts, with their supporting vouchers, are then sent to the First Auditor of the Treasury for examination and audit py him.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT,

1902.

VI. OFFICE OF EDITOR OF PUBLICATIONS.
ISAAC WINSTON, Editor. C. F. Dewoody, Stenographer and typewr£ter, Sept. 28 to Nov. I8. C. J. Hellerstedt, Stenograplzer and t;pewriter, Nov. I9 to June 30.

On July l, 1901, the Annual Report for 1900 was running through the press, and nearly all. the proof of this publication was read after that date. An index to the volume was prepared and the last revised proof was returned to the printer on October 24. Bound copies were receh·ed for distribution on April l, 1902. The fourteen leaflets prepared for distribution at the Buffalo Exposition were revised, and a new edition prepared for printing and sent to the printer on August 6. The Spanish translation of thirteen of the first edition of these leaflets was revised by M. Felipe Valle, Ingenieur-geographe, Directeur de l'Observatoire astronomique, Professor a l'Ecole militaire, Membre du_Conseil superieur du Cadastre, Tacubaya, Mexico, and the accuracy of the translation, which has elicited complimentary comment from a distinguished Spanish scientist, is due to his courteous kindness. The Spanish edition of the leaflets was published on July 24, l90I. An abstract of the work of the Survey during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1901, was prepared for the Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The Annual Report covering the progress of the work for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1901, was compiled, prepared for printing and submitted to Congress ready to print on December 6, 1901. This included the work of editing Appendix No. 3. The first proof of Special Publication No. 7, ''The Oblique Arc of the United States and Osculating Spheroid," was received on January 2 and final proof of this publication was returned to the printer on February 27, 1902. Bound copies of the volume were received on June 25, 1902. The first proof of your Annual Report for 1901 was received on February 25, 1902, an alphabetical index was prepared and the final proof was returned to the printer on March 25. Bound copies of the volume were received on June 13, 1902. A list of geographic names in the Hawaiian Islands was edited and prepared for printing. United States Coast Pilot, Part VI, Chesapeake Bay and Tributaries, prepared in the Office of the Inspector of Hydrography and Topography, was sent to the printer. The proof of this publication was read by the Coast Pilot party, but only a few unbound. copies were received in advance, by the courtesy of the Public Printer, before the close of the fiscal year. A volume of Tide Tables for 1903, prepared in the Tidal Division, was sent to the printer and nearly all the proof was read by the Tidal Division before the close of the fiscal year. A new edition of the Catalogue of Charts, prepared in the Chart Division, was edited and printed, but no copies were received during the year. A large volume, the United States Declination Tables, prepared in the Division of Terrestrial Magnetism, was edited and sent to the printer. In addition to the above, the routine duties of Editor and numerous assignments to temporary duty were performed.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT,

Previous to September 28, a typewriter was assigned to this office on two occasions for short periods. From November to July, about two-thirds of the time of the typewriter was occupied in compiling a list and catalogue of the publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, covering the period of its existence, under the direction of the Librarian, Mr. E. L. Burchard. The publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey during the fiscal year are given in the following list:
Report of the Superintendent Coast and Geodetic Survey showing the progress of the work from July 1, 1899, to June 30, 1900, with the following appendices published also as separates: No. 3. Oblique Boundary Line between California and Nevada, by C. II. Sinclair, Assistant. No. 4. Proportion and spacing of Roman Letters as ascertained from the best examples, by Williams \Velch, Draftsman. No. 5.

Extension of Tables for the computation of Geodetic Positions to the Equator, by John F. Hayford, Assistant, etc. No. 5. Detern1ination of relative value of Gravity in Europe and the United States in 1900, by G. R. Putnam, Assistant. No. 6. Triangulation northward along the ninety-eighth meridian in Kansas and Nebraska, by John F. Hayford, Assistant, etc. The Eastern Oblique Arc of the United States and Osculating Spheroid, by Charles A. Schott, Assistant. (Special publication No. 7.) United States Coast Pilot, Pacific Coast, Alaska, Part I, from· Dixon Entrance to Yakutat Bay, with inland passage from Juan de Fuca Strait to Dixon Entrance. Fourth edition. Bulletin No. 40. Alaska Coast Pilot Notes on the Fox Island Passes, Unalaska Hay, Bering Sea, and Arctic Ocean as far as Point Barrow. Fourth edition, with additions and changes. Notices to Mariners Nos. 273 to 285. Fourteen leaflets (illustrated) describing the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Second English edition. Thirteen leaflets (illustrated) describing the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey.

The loss to the Survey by death during the year was unusually heavy, as shown by the following list: Mr. William A. Thompson, Engraver,' died on July 22, 19c,1. He was born September 18, 1838, at Washington, D. C., and entered the Coast Survey as an apprentice in his seventeenth year. He served eighteen months without

compensation and was permanently appointed on July l, 1856. His service was continuous until death ended his long and useful life. He was appointed Chief Engraver in 1897, and still held that position at the time of his death. The numerous copperplates in the archives engraved by him show the excellence of his work and form an enduring monument to his patience and industry. The announcement of the death of Assistant Schott, issued by the Superintendent, is republished below: · U.S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY, 11/ashington, D. C., August I9, I90I. The Superintendent announces .with great regret the death of Charles Anthony Schott, Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey. After being ill for four months, he passed quietly away at his home on July 31, 1901. This sad event has deprived the Survey of one of its oldest and most able members. Mr. Schott was boni at Mannheim, Baden, Germany, August 7, 1826, and graduated from the Polytechnic School at Carlsruhe with the degree of civil engineer in 1847. He came to the United States in 1848, and at once began his life work in the Computing Division of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. During the years 1850 to 1855 he acted as Chief of the Division during irregular periods, and from 1855 until the close of 1899 was continuously in full charge of that important part of the office. In 1898 he attended, as the representative of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, the International Conference on Terrestrial Magnetism, held in Bristol, England. On February 4, 1899, at the White House, Mr. Schott was presented by the President of the United States with the Wilde prize, which had been conferred upon him by the Academy of Sciences of France in recognition of his researches in terrestrial magnetism. According to the terms accepted by the academy in founding the prize, it was to be given each year to the person from any nation whose discoveries in astronomy, physics, chel_llistry, mineralogy, geology, or experimental mechanics are judged by the academy to be most worthy of reward. On January r, 1900, Assistant Schott was relieved of the burden of the charge of the Computing Division, which he had carried with most remarkable success for nearly a half century. Thus freed from the daily round of exacting routine duties, and with two computers to help him, he was authorized to devote all his time to the problem of determining the size and figure of the earth from the geodetic measures made within the United States. During 1900 and the first half of 1901 his great work," The Transcontinental Triangulation," was put into print; and the manuscrip~ of his report on the "Eastern Oblique Arc of the United States" was made ready for the printer. To few men has it been given as to Assistant Schott to have a long and useful life completely rounded out in its latter days by the receipt of well-deserved honors and by the satisfactory completion of great works. At a meeting of the members of the Coast and Geodetic Survey held at the office on August l, 1901, the following well-deserved tribute to Assistant Schot.t was unanimously adopted:
He was enthusiastic, faithful, and diligent in all duties he was called upon to perform, and through his learning and probity earned a reputation extending over two continents which is most worthy of emulation. Conscientious and expert in his specialties, geodesy and terrestial mag1:1.etism, his labors

REPORT OF THE SlTPERINTENDENT.

added immeasurably to the reputation of the Bureau and of his comrades who gathered the material he so ably discussed. The methods of computation now in use in the Bureau are an indelible record of his ability. His high ideals of duty and his tireless and persistent striving for them made him stand forth as a noble example of the best type of public official, and his uniform kindliness endeared him to those who knew him as a friend.

Mr. Charles Mahon, Draftsman, died on January 8, 1902. Mr. Mahon was a native of Pennsylvania and entered the Survey previous to l 850, serving first as hydrographic draftsman on board ship, and afterwards as topographic draftsman in the office. In 1850 he resigned the position of draftsman, but continued to make topographic drawings for the Survey under contract until 1853, when he went South and was employed in railroad business. He was chief engineer of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad previous to the civil war. About 1875 he was employed in the Hydrographic Office of the Navy Department, and on October 12, 1885, he was again appointed draftsman in the Coast and Geodetic Survey and served in that capacity until he died. Mr. Edward Henry Courtenay, Computer, died on June 3, 1902. Mr. Courtenay. was born April l l, 1842, in Rhode Island, and entered the Coast Survey January 2, 1862, in his nineteenth year. He was immediately assigned to duty in the Computing Division of the Office, and his service was continuous until he died. For many years he was the senior computer in the Service. · A meeting of his associates in the Computing Division was held on the day after his death and the following resolution was adopted:
That in the death of our late associate, Edward Henry Courtenay, we haYe lost a co-worker whose courtesy, patient forbearance, and kindliness endeared him to all, and the Survey a member who has devoted his wholeworkinglife with undivided loyalty to its service. We can but feebly pay tribute to the memory of a fellow-worker whose splendid attainments are recognized by every member of the Survey. A member oQf the Computing Division during the years when its methods were being rapidly developed, he was of invaluable assistance with his unusual talent for systematic and careful work. For over forty years he gave able and devoted service, and has left in the archives of this Office many volumes of his computations and adjustments, work which for accuracy and completeness has no equal, and which will always be an enduring memorial to him.

Magnetic observations in various localities in the Eastern Division were placed in charge of Assistant L. A. Bauer, and the observers named above were assigned to work under his direction as chief of party. Mr. W. G. Cady was continued in immediate charge of the magnetic observatory at Cheltenham, Md., until May I, 1902, when he was relieved and the immediate charge of the observatory transferred to Mr. L. G. Schultz. The Adie magnetograph was in operation continuously, giving photographic records of the three magnetic elements, and very few hourly values were lost. The necessary observations for scale value and torsion were made. Three Eschenhagen magnetographs were received at the observatory during the year at different times, as follows: No. 6 was examined and returned to the Office without being set up; No. 4 was in operation from August 2 I to October 2 for tests and comparisons, and was then returned to the Office; No. 5 was in operation continuously after August 29, and is the standard set of variation instruments at the observatory. It recorded only the declination and horizontal intensity previous to April 22, when the instrument for measuring the vertical intensity was put in operation, but a satisfactory record of the vertical intensity could not be secured without an additional recording apparatus, which was not secured before the close of the fiscal year. The necessary scale values w~re determined, and the clockwork was so adjusted that a successful record can be obtained when the cylinders rotate once in two hours. The average daily range of temperature in the variometer rooms was not more than two or three tenths of a degree Centigrade. A sudden change of temperature outside produces a comparatively small change inside the variometer rooms and the effect is only shown after a considerable interval of time, sometimes after another change of the temperature on the outside from rising to falling or the contrary. Observations were made each week to determine the absolute value of the three magnetic elements. Meteorological observations were made daily in the manner prescribed by the United States Weather Bureau for "voluntary observers." 70

The completion of the hydro~aphic survey in the vicinity of Shooters Island, New York, commenced during the previous fiscal year under the direction of Assistant Vinal, was' assigned to Assistant J. B. Boutelle, commanding the schooner Eagre. The vessel reached New York on July 7, and field work began immediately, The survey was completed on July 20, and the vessel proceeded to Erie Basin for repairs to the steam launch Inspector, which were completed on August 9. On that date the vessel proceeded to Ossining, N. Y., in order to continue the survey of the Hudson River in that vicinity. The survey began in the vicinity of Hook Mountain, at a point where the work of the previous season closed, and was extended to a point just above Anthonys Nose. The shore line was verified, and wherever changes had occurred a new survey was made. The triangulation was extended from Stony Point Light-House to Anthonys Nose, and the hydrography covered the river within these limits. The sounding lines were run and crossed. at distances from 100 to 300 meters. The work in this vicinity closed on November 24, and the vessel proceeded to New York for repairs. While the repairs were in progress, the position of the following light-houses, beacons, etc., was determined: Robbins Reef Light-House, West Bank Light-House, Great Beds Light-House, Governors Island Post Light, Waackaack Rear Beacon, Sandy Hook North Beacon, Sandy Hook South Beacon, Sandy Hook Fog Bell. On February 27, 1902, the party on the Eagre began the hydrographic resurvey on the Tred Avon and Choptank rivers, in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. Tide gauges were established at Oxford, Cambridge, Choptank River Light-House, and Sharps Island Light-House, and the signals needed in the work were erected. The hydrographic work was continued by the whole party until June 17, except for twenty days in May (7 to 27), when the vessel was at Baltimore for repairs. On June 17 the vessel proceeded to New York, and was engaged in experiments in the use of wireless telegraphy under the direction of Assistant Wainwright for the remainder of the fiscal year. A party consisting of five officers and five seamen, with the steam launch Inspector and a whaleboat, was landed at Oxford and left to continue the work under charge of Watch Officer Moser, and the work was in progress on June 30. The statistics of the work are given above.

Reservation, on which it was proposed to erect a laboratory for the Marine-Hospital Service, Assistant Bowie was instructed to make the observations required to furnish the desired information. He made the necessary preparations and executed the field work, which included cross sections of the site of the building at intervals of ten feet. Four <lays, October 23 to 26, were occupied in the work and the elevations were all referred to the Datum Plane of the Topographic Survey of the District of Columbia. A sketch showing the details desired was prepared and forwarded to Mr. Taylor. A special exani.ination of the shore line and hydrography at the entrance of Great Egg Harbor, New Jersey, was ordered for the purpose of ascertaining the depth of water which could be carried through the channel from Atlantic City and across the harbor to Ocean City. This'work was assigned to Assistant Bowie, and Deck Officer Gershom Bradford 2cl was detailed to assist in the work. The party reached Ocean City on December 2 and the work was completed on December 21. Three triangulation stations were occupied with a plane table, and the position of a number of objects determined for use in the topcgraphic and ·hydrographic work. These stations were also occupied with a theodolite and certain necessary angles measured. Tide gauges were established at Ocean City and at Longport. Continuous tide observations, day and night, were made at Ocean City for sixteen days, and day observations were made at Longport for seven days. Both tide gauges were referred to permanent bench marks. A portion of the shore line of Beach Thoroughfare and at the entrance was surveyed with a plane table, and a distance of 6 miles covered. The weather was unfavorable for hydrographic work on account of strong wind and freezing temperature frequently prevailing. The strong tides in Beach Thoroughfare prevented the adoption of a regular system of sounding lines normal to the shore, except at slack water, and a system of lines diagonal to the current was substituted. A jetty was under construction at Longport to protect the point of land to the north of the Inlet, and for the purpose of producing a channel across the large sand fiat in front of Longport, and its position was determined. In his report on the work, Assistant Bowie expresses his appreciation of the valuable assistance rendered by Deck Officer Bradford and Quartermaster Emanuelson in the prosec~tion of the work. A hydrographic examination in the Yicinity of Shooters Island, New York, was undertaken for the purpose of verifying the sotindings shown on the hydrographic sheet covering the region, and the work was assigned to Assistant Bowie. He proceeded to the locality, accompanied by Mr. William Sanger, captain's clerk, and made the necessary observations. A boat and such officers and men as were needed were assigned to the work by Assistant \Velker, commanding the steamer Bache, who also detailed a man to make tide observations. The work was successfully completed in four days, January 22 to 25.

kilornctcrs of completecl line. 9<:J bench marks established.

The adjustment of the precise leveling work in the United States, executed to date, indicated a serious discrepancy in a closed figure, including the line from Decatur, Ala., to Corinth, ~Iiss., ancl it was decided to revise the elevations along this line. These elevations were determined under the direction of the Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army, in connection with the improvement of the Tennessee River. Aicl Dibrell was instructed to make the revision by rerunning the line beginning at Decatur and carrying a single line of levels over the route along the Southern Railway. Alternate sections, approximately equal, were leveled in opposite directions and the elevation of all permanent bench marks, which were recovered, was vedfied as stated. \Vhen the work reached Tuscumbia it was found necessary to le,·el back to Decatur, which completed a double line between these points, run in the usual manner in both directions. A single line was le\'eled between Tuscumbia and Corinth, and 19 kilometers of the distance was releveled on account of a change indicated in the elevations of two old bench marks, which it was necessary to verify. In leveling between Burns\'ille and Iuka, Miss., the discrepancy indicated by the adjustment of the figure was discovered ancl verified, and the line closed at Corinth in a satisfactory manner. 'l'he party reached Decatur, Ala., on October 20 and was disbanded at Corinth, Miss., on December 10. Veloc~pede cars were not used on this work, and considerable time was lost in walking to and from work. In order to revise the elevations previously established along the Hudson River between Dobbs Ferry and Rensselaer (Green bush), 1\. Y., Aid Dibrell organized a leveling party at Dobbs Ferry and began field work on April 15 by establishing three new bench marks at that place. One of the old bench marks previously established was found undisturbed and in good condition and it was used as a base for the leveling work. The route follows the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad to Rensselaer, N. Y. The usual method of running the levels in both directions was used on this work. The elevation of numerous bench marks previously established along the route was determined, and at Poughkeepsie, Hudson, and Troy the line was connected with the bench marks used by the city engineers. The elevations of two bench marks established by the United States Geological Survey at Poughkeepsie, and of nine bench marks established by the Deep \Vaterways Commission at Hudson, Stockport, Stuyvesant, Stuyvesant Light-House (one between Stuyvesant and Castleton), Castleton, Rensselaer, and Troy were also determined. The line was connected with eighteen railroad bench marks. Two unusual conditions were found on this line, very slight changes of elevation prevailed and a large body of water was nearly always present on one side of the line. The traffic was heavy and the numerous trains prevented the use of velocipede cars as the means of transportation, which resulted in much loss of time and made the work unusually laborious. The work was completed 011 June 14.

Topography: 1 ooo acres of area surveyed. 2 miles of shore line surveyed. 3 miles of road surveyed. 5 miles of trolley roads surveyed.

The topographic survey of the Little Choptank River was in progress on July I, 1901, by a party under charge of Extra Observer J. W. Donn. During the month of July the triangulation of the lower portion of the river and southward along the line of Slaughter Creek was continued, and a survey was made of the shore line of James Island, the upper end of Taylors Island, and the river from Hills Point and Oyster Bay to Ragged Point and Tobacco Stick Bay. The work was also extended southward to the Honga Bridge, and the topography on the east side of Slaughter Creek from the bridge at Honga crossing to that at Taylors Island was completed. The old survey of 1843-1848 was examined and partially revised. The shore and marginal work of the bay from Meekins Neck to Oyster Bay Inlet was also completed. The necessity for a survey of Slaughter Creek from the Little Choptank to the Honga was recognized and an attempt was made to extend the triangulation over the region, but it was found to be impracticable to make observations across the wide expanse of marsh. The shores of the creek were so unstable along more than half its length that it was decided to close the triangulation when half the distance had been covered, and to extend the work by a plane table traverse to Honga Bridge. The triangulation was extended up the Little. Choptank to a point within a mile of the head, and up Fishing and Church creeks about the same distance. In surveying the shore line careful provision was made to facilitate the hydrographic work, and many plane-table points were marked and described, and other objects back from the shore determined. The work closed on November 30. In April Mr. ponn was directed to take up the topographic survey of the Potomac River between Indian head, Md., and Georgetown, D. C. On June 1 a special survey of the Naval Reservation at Indianhead was begun, and this work was completed on the\ 18th. Jose Vano Reyes, aid, joined the party on the 3d and remained until the 7th. The members of the party had no experience in executing large scale work, but they gave close attention to their duties and good progress was made. Contours at intervals of 5 feet were determined over all open ground, including the route of the trolley lines which extend from the Potomac River to Mattawoman Creek connecting the factories

Assistant Fairfield reached Augusta on December 18 and took personal charge of the operations in the field. During January and February the reconnaissance was completed, and twelve observing tripods and scaffolds, ranging in height from 30 to 75 feet, with an average height of 58, were erected. The connection between the end of the direct measurement from the coast inland, completed during the previous fiscal year, and the astronomic station at Augusta was made, and the stations were all marked in a substantial manner. From January 26 to February 3 the station at Clarks Hill, S. C., was occupied for the purpose of testing acetylene lamps under the direction of the Inspector of Geodetic Work. These lamps had been prepared for use as objects to observe upon in measuring angles at night, and they served the purpose in a satisfactory manner. Signalman Bilby was detached from the party on February 14. On March ro the observations began at Beech Island Station, and the measurement of angles was continued until the close of the fiscal year, and as rapid progress made as the atmospheric conditions permitted. At the four stations in the first quadrilateral, Beech Island, Butler Reservoir and Post-Office, · the observations were made during the day, and poles were used as objects to observe upon, all these lines being short, but at all other stations acetylene lamps were used and the angles were measured at night. Unfavorable weather prevailed until

The smoke resulted from burning brush, etc., on land cleared by farmers for agricultural purposes. Thomas Nelson Page, jr., joined the party as recorder in January, but unfortu11ately became ill soon afterwards, and died at the hospital in Augusta on January 30. Mr. Page was an intelligent and capable man, and his death was a loss to the party. The work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

The resurvey of certain portions o~ Chesapeake Bay was assigned to Assistant Flower. He made the necessary preparations and sailed from Baltimore on August 19 for Tangier Sound. The second watch officer, Mr. C. F. Adae, was unfit for duty on account of sickness and was left at Baltimore. He reported for duty on September 19. The \Vind was unfavorable and the lack of officers on hoard made it necessary to anchor the vessel at night. The party reached Deal Island on August 22 and field operations began the next day. Some old triangulation points were recovered and some new ones established. Se\·eral stations selected by Assistant Vinal were occupied. There was no launch attached to the vessel at this time and the shoal water prevented the close approach of the schooner to the working ground, and time was lost in using row boats. This work continued until August 30. On September 2 the schooner was anchored in Hooper Strait and the topographic work began. The first topographic sheet included Bloodsworth Island, South !vlarsh, Holland Island, and several of the adjacent islands. Ou September 6 steam launch No. 22 arrived for the use of the party, but the large quantity of water needed daily for use in the launch greatly curtailed its usefulness. \Vater could only be obtained on

The first topographic sheet was finished on October 11, and the party moved to Crisfield and began topographic work on Smiths Island and hydrographic work in the Little Annemessex River. After completing the topographic work within reach of Crisfield, Assistant Flower took the topographic party to Smiths Island and li,·ed on shore until the survey was completed.. The hydrographic work in the Little Annemessex River was completed and work was then begun in Kedge Strait. The unfavorable weather, the floating ice, and freezing weather seriously delayed the progress of the work during the winter months. \Vatch Officer Thompson reported on board 011 Xovember 16 for the purpose of testing his sounding machine, and the launch was iJlaced at his disposal whenever he needed it until December 19, when he went to Baltimore to make changes and repairs and to make further tests i11 the vicinity. He returned to the schooner on :\larch 2 1, and the sounding machine received several tests before ?\fay 31, when the last test was made. After this date Mr. Thompson aided in the work of· the party and re11dered valuable assistance. The party remained in the field continuously during the winter, and the hydrography of Kedge Strait was completed. The weather was severe and there was a great deal of ice and strong wind almost every day, \vhich greatly delayed the progress of the work. The interior topography, extending from the Big Annemessex River to the Pocomoke River, was begun on February 20 and completed on :-.fay 8. Hydrographic work in Tangier Sound was continued and was iu progress at the close of the fiscal year.

The extension of the triangulation in Sapelo Sound, Georgia, and the recovery and re-marking of triangulation points to the northward, including the determination of the geographic positions of the light-house~ and beacons when not known, was assigned to Assistant French. After making the necessary preparation he proceeded to Sapelo Sound, Georgia, and began field work on pecember 29. Several of the old triangulation stations were recovered to form a base for the new work in establishing positions to be used in the hydrographic surve)· of the sound, and obsen·ations \\·ere made at 14 stations and 20 new geographic positions were determined. The work in this locality was finished :-\o. 1.\. on February 2, and Assistant French 0 Baldwin Chy took up the work along the coast to i~ '\ the northward. A small sloop was '.. : hired and. used as quarters and to transport the party from place to place as the work progressed. South of the Savannah River nearly all of the stations which had been marked with underground marks were recO\·erecl. Some of the stations of the triangulation along the s~wannah River, established by the U. S. Army Engineers bet\yeen Savannah and Tybee Light-House, were occupied and observations made to determine their positions and the positions of the numerous beacons and light-houses in this dcinity. In the vicinity of Port Port Royal Royal Sound all the stations, of which descriptions were furnished, were reStntutu Miles O'._.:::=-· ~ '1'"'t-· covered, and the positions of three SkullBeacon J<ilom<>ters { '\" beacons were determined. At St. ·Helena Sound more trian'friangnlntion, vici111ty of Port Royal, S. C. gulation was necessary to furnish positions for l1se in the proposed hydrographic examination. X one of the old station on the shores of the sound could be found, but three old stations near by to the southwest were recovered and the new stations were established without much difficulty. Between St. Helenr. Sound and Charleston very few of the old stations were found, but fortunately all the primary stations except two were recovered. The ends and four of the mile stones of the Edisto Base Line were reco\·ered. The large monument at the east en<l had been o\·erturnecl and the underground mark dug up, hut three of the reference stones were ·found apparently undisturbed and the monument was replaced in position on a cement foundation. Most of the old stations in the vicinity of Charleston and to the northward as far as Bulls Bay, for which descriptions were furnished, were recO\·ered. A fe\\' statiou:i,

TRIANGULA'rION.

Reconnaissance: 345 square miles area covered. 68 triangulation stations selected. Triangulation: 335 square miles area covered. 61 stations occupied. 258 geographic positions determined.

The triangulation of the Potomac River was assigned to Assistant McGrat1i, and he was directed to extend the triangulation of the river inland from its mouth, basing the work upon a line of the Chesapeake B:iy triangulation, and determining all the points necessary for the topographic and hydrographic survey of the river, and for the extension of surveys up all the tributary streams of importance. Only three stations in the former triangulation of the river were recovered-Point Lookout Light-House, Piney Point Light-House, and Blakistone Island Light-House. The banks on both sides of the Lower Potomac River are alluvial in character and are constantly subject to erosion. The sharp bends and numerous trees in existence more than thirty-five years ago forced the location of the stations near the water line, and as a result the old stations have nearly all been destroyed. The location of these old points on the charts of the river furnished to the party greatly facilitated the work of reconnaissance.

94

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1902.

Assistant McGrath and party reached St. Georges Island on August 8, and a reconnaissance was started from the line, Point Lookout Light-House to Bitt, and extended up the river. A search was made for the stations of the old work, but only three were recovered, as stated. The station Bitt, of the Chesapeake Bay triangulation, was established in recent years. A steam launch was used by the party as the only practicable means of transportation in the region along the river. It was difficult to seciire quarters for the party, and long trips in the launch to and from work were frequently necessary. The weather was in general very favorable for the work, and very little time was lost on account of bad weather, previous to November r, but after that date there was a gale of wind from the northwest nearly all the time for several weeks, which greatly delayed the progress of the work. About December r ice began to form in the creeks and along the banks of the river and occasioned much delay in the work, becoming impassable with the launch in many places toward the close of the month. A large quantity of fresh water was needed for use in the launch, and this was at times supplied with difficulty and delay. In spite of these obstacles constant progress was made until the work closed on December 3 r, and the party was disbanded on January 1. Assistant McGrath's report commends the conduct of all the members of his party, and makes special mention of the valuable assistance rendered by Thomas Nelson Page, jr.', James E. Marsh, and Henry Becker, whose devotion to duty greatly facilitated the progress of the work· and rendered possible the result accomplished.

A resun-ey in the vicinity of Chincoteague Island being necessary, the reco,·ery of old triangulation stations and the establishment of new ones for this purpose was assigned to Assistant Mosman. He sent Foremau E. E. Torrey to the island on }.lay I 6 to make all necessary preliminary arrangements, and on :!\1ay 25 proceeded to the island and took charge of the operations in the field. Two old triangulation points, Nock aud Tayl0r, were recovered. From the line between them, used as a base, the triangulation was extended I5 miles to the northeast and ro miles to the east, to Fishing Point. The obsen·ations began on June 5 and were continued during the remainder of the fiscal year. The geographi~ positions of the Jife-sa,·ing station at Assateague and at Wallops, and of Assateague Light-House, Killick Shoal Light-House, and Bug LightHouse were determined during the progress of the work. The necessity of tra\·eling long distances, to erect signals and to occupy stations, in a sailboat, and the fact that obsenrations could only be made very early in the morning and very late in the afternoon, caused considerable delay in the progress of the work. The work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

Topography: 15 sqtwre mile,; area coverecl. 3 miles shore line creeks and ponds surveyed. 84 miles roads surveyed.

The continuation of the topographic survey in the vicinity of Portsmouth, ~. H., was assigned to Assistant Nelson. He reached Portsmouth on August I 2 and began the field work without unnecessary delay. The work on the Portsmouth Harbor sheet was slow and tedious on account of the peculiar topographic features of the surrounding country, and the dense growth of timber covering the region surveyed. A large area of wooded marsh was cle\·eloped during the progress of the work. The roads and trails in the locality are very crooked and narrow, and much time was spent in determining their position, as they were necessarily used in fixing the boundaries and outlines of the wooded marshes. Some of the prominent points are from So to 100 feet high. These were covered with a dense growth of pines and a great deal of cutting was necessary in order to develop the contours. An unsuccessful effort was made to place the city of Portsmouth on the topographic sheet by reducing the plan found on published maps, but this proved to be impracticable, and a complete topographic survey was made of the city. The work on the Portsmouth Harbor sheet, extending from the entrance to the Piscataqua River bridge was completed. on October 3 1 and the field work of the party closed on that date.

The published edition of United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VI, having been exhausted, X autical Expert J ohu Ross was placed in command of the steamer Hj1drograpltcr and instructed to collect the information necessary to bring a new edition up to elate. The work began in Baltimore Harbor on Xovember 13. The party left Baltimore 011 :November 15 and inspected the mouth of the Susquehanna River and Curtis Bay. On November 20 the party again started from Baltimore and inspected the following places: Swan Point Bar, Elk River to Town Point, Sassafras River to Betterton, Chester River to Qneenstown, and thence to Annapolis. On November 22 the party inspected Eastern Bay up to St. Michaels, and then returned to Baltimore for coal and water. On the 27th the vessel left Baltimore and proceeded to \Vashiugton to examine the Potomac River. The following places were then visited in the order stated: Great \Vicomico River, York River, ~orfolk, James River, and Cape Charles City. On January 7 Assistant Edwin Smith went on board the vessel at Norfolk and was transported to the following places for the purpose of determining the magnetic declination for use on the charts, viz: Old Point Comfort, entrance of York River and of Rappahannock River, Tangier Sound and Hooper Strait, returning to Baltimore on January 15. At the places visited, and during the passage of the vessel from place to place, notes were made of all changes which affected the coast pilot volume above referred to, and sufficient information was collected, by personal inspection of certain localities, and by inquiry from ship masters, pilots, officers ill ~harge of improvements, and others, for the publication of a revised edition of the Coast Pilot, Volume No. VI. The weather was unfavorable a great portion of the time, and as many localities were visited· with the vessel as the late season, pre\'ailing winds, and ice permitted. The work clo~ed at Baltimore on J antrnry r 7. The revision of the coast pilot volume covering the coast of l\faine bemg necessary, the collection of information for ·this purpose was assigned to John Ross, nautical expert, and on l\fay 2-7 he took command of the steamer Hj·drograpl1cr at \Vashington, D. C. He proceeded to Eastport, Me., via New York and Boston, and began the collection of coast pilot information at that place on June 25. This work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. ·

Assistant Smith reached Omaha, Nebr., on the I 2th, and found it impracticable to occupy the old station on account of obstruction of view by the growth of trees and the erection of a building since the station was established. A new station was established and connected with the old station, and all necessary preparations for work completed. Assistant Fairfield reached Fenimore, \Vis., on September 12 and recovered the triangulation stations Mount Ida and Fenimore, with which to connect the longitude station, when determined. A longitude station was then selected with this object in vie\\·, the necessary preparations were made, and everything was ready for work on September 2 I.

The investigation of the Marconi system of wireless telegraphy with reference to its possible adoption for use in determining the difference of longitude, by the telegraphic method, between places where no wire connection existed, was assigned to Assistant Wainwright. The New York Herald ha.d established and was operating a wireless telegraph , station at Siasconset, Nantucket Island, 1\Iass., in connection with a wireless telegraph outfit placed by the Herald on the Nantucket light-ship, 50 miles offshore, for the purpose of receiving messages from steamships equipped with similar apparatus and passing close enough to the light-ship to communkate through it with the shore in this

way. All the facilities thus afforded were courteously placed at Assistant\Vainwright's disposal by the manager of the New York Herald, and the thanks of the Coast and Geodetic Survey are due to that corporation for their liberality, which rendered it possible to make this interesting investigation at this time. All necessary preparations were made and Assistant \Vaimvright reached Siasconset on October 4. The experiments at the shore station consisted in simulating the essential conditions of a field telegraph station used in telegraphic longitude work and in obtaining a record· of the customary time signals. For this purpose the chronograph was mounted in the operating room, together with the break-circuit chronometer. The programme included, first, the sending of a message to the light-ship notifying the operator when to send time signals; second, the time signals from the light-ship, consisting of a signal commencing in an even minute and repeated every five seconds for two minutes; third, a message from the light-ship giving the correction of the chronometer; fourth, a test to show the lag of the armature in circuit. All the foregoing sets of signals were recorded on the chronograph. The chronometer \Yas out of the circuit when verbal messages were sent or received, as it would interfere with the clearness of the code signals. \Vhile the time signals were being' received the chronometer \ms in circuit, and the record conforms to the customary field astronomical station record. In order to obtain on the chronograph the signals sent to the light-vessel, a specially designed make-and-break key was substituted for the Marconi key and connected with the chronograph circuit. When receiving signals from the light-vessel the chronographchronometer circuit was connected with the Marconi tape recorder, a pony relay being interposed so that when the signals of the light-vessel functioned the coherer, and its local circuits were closed, the chronograph-chronometer circuit would be broken· and the pen deflected on the chronograph sheet. In arranging the apparatus for longitude work, the pony relay and also the tape recorder would be dispensed with, and the chronograph circuit directly connected with the polarized relay adjoining the coherer. The lag of the armatures, or the time consumed by them in moving between contacts, was determined by cutting out the resistance and condenser in c;ircuit with the chronometer, thus allowing a spark to be made by the contact wheel at each break, the result being that the contact wheel in breaking would cause one deflection of the chronograph pen, and the spark, by functioning the coherer, cause another break through the pony relay and another and later deflection of the pen. The space between the two deflections would indicate the armature lag. Covering the period· of the experimental work on Nantucket, time observations were made with a sextant and artificial horizon, and the data obtained for computing a difference of longitude which, though rough, is probably the first determination by wireless telegraph. The experiments were successfully concluded on October 20. \Vhile on Nantucket Island, Assi~tant \Vainwright detennined the positions of the two beacon Eghts on the ends of the Nantucket Harbor jettys. In April Assistant Waimvright proceeded to Barren Island, Chesapeake Bay, in response to a request from the N a\·y Department, for the purpose of relocating the water beacons marking the speed trial course off that island, which had been carried away by ice during the previous winter. The steamer Endeavor, Assistant F. A. Young, commanding, was placed at Assistant \Vainwright's disposal for this work. The shore beacons were repaired and whitewashed and the water beaco1is were reconstructed by

the contractors under Assistant \Vainwright's direction. He also ,·erified some topographic details in Honga River. This work was successfully completed on April 20. From April 24 to 29 Assistant \Vainwright was again in the field witnessing the trial of the Fessenden wireless telegraph apparatus in operation in the Yicinity of Roanoke Island, Xorth Carolina. In June ( 15 to 30) additional tests of the Marconi wireless telegraph apparatus were made under the direction of Assistant Wainwright. These tests were made possible by the liberality of. the Marconi \Vireless Telegraph Company of America, which furnished an operator and apparatus for the cost of its installation and operation on board the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey schooner Eagre. The tests were made between the ~Iarconi wireless telegraph station at Sagaponack. on the eastern end of Long Island, New York, and the Eagre at yarious distances. The plan \vas to have the Eagre establish easy connection with the station on shore and then proceed away from the station to determine how far this particular fonn of apparatus was available for signaling, as used in telegraphic longitude work. On the first trial in the latter part of June the apparatus was installed on the Eagre without any alteration in her standing rigging, which consists entirely of wire rope set up with turnbuckles. This gaye a continuous length of wire rope from each topmast of almost 125 feet. As was partly anticipated, short distances only could be used for the purpose intended and the results of this· test maii1ly consisted in familiarizing se,·eral officers of the Sun-ey with the working of the apparatus and in indicating more effecti\'e arrangements 111 future tests. ThiEO work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

bottoms were hired for the use of the rodmen in passing from point to point along the marsh shore line, as it was found to be impassable on foot on account of the mud and numerous creeks to be crossed. The rodmen soon became expert in the use of the paddle and made excellent progress between stations. It was necessary for the party to live i1i the towns, and for this reason the work was completed as far as possible from Crisfield before moving the party to another town. A wagon and team was used to transport the party to and from Apes Hole Creek and Jen kins Creek. The launch was anchored in these creeks, and consequently the party was able to do work in Pocomoke Sound and in Great Annemessex ancl ~Iano kin rivers before moving from Crisfield on XO\·ember 4. After completing this work the party moved to Ellicotts Island on Fishing Bay, and a sun·ey was.made of the bay, joining the work of Assistant Vinal at Station Rose and based upon data furni,;hed by him. \Vhile the party was at Ellicotts Island some work was done around Bishbps Head to join the work of Assistant Vinal to that of Assistant Forney, and a sun·ey was made of the settlement of Ellicotts Island. On November 16 the party moved to \Vhite Haven on the \Vicomico River and a survey was made of Ellis and l\fonie bays and the \Vicomico River, including the town of \Vhite Haven and the settlement of l\Iount Vernon. This work was all based upon triangulation executed by Assistant Vinal. On December 4, before completing this work, it became necessary to transfer the party to Deals Island in order to connect the work previously executed there with the work of Assistant Vinal.

apart, and outside of this area the lines were sounded from 300 to 600 meters apart. The sounding work began on March 4 and progressed as rapidly as the weather concli 7 tions permitted. \Vhen the conditions \\·ere not favorable for outside work, the work in the sound was done. The inside work included the development of the anchorage at the national quarantine station and of the sound as far as Bog Hammock, with a few additional lines of soundings made to afford a comparison with previous work. Eleven miles of shore line was also surveyed in connection with this work. The shore line near the entrance has changed considerably, both points having been washed off. Tide observations were made at the quarantine station in the harbor, which is 8 or 10 miles inside the bar. Current observations were made at two stations, one on the bar and one at the entrance. The work in Sapelo Sound was completed on April l l and the vessel proceeded to Savannah for repairs. The hydrographic examination of the entrance to St. Helena Sound began on l\fay 7 and was completed on the 14th. A gas-pipe signal was established on a shoal, bare at low water, just south of the main channel on line between Hunting Island LightHouse and Bay Point, and about midway bet~veen them, and such signals as were necessary were erected at the triangulation points previously established. All the available time was used in developing the hydrography of the main channel and bar. Lines were sounded from loo to 200 meters apart, and tide obsen~ations were made at a station in Big Bay Creek. The tide gauge was referred to bench marks established for reference. The vessel was needed for other duty and the examination was concluded on :May 14 and the vessel sailed the same clay for Washington via Charleston.

The work was suspended and the ,·essels proceeded to the relief of the schooner .111abcl Jordan of Thomaston, Me., which was aground on the western edge of the 17-foot shoal, about 7 j6 miles northeast of :N'antucket LightHouse. The schooner was hauled off the shoal into deep water and furnished with directions for continuing her passage. A crew 'from the Caskata Life Saving Station, searching for the schooner, was afterwards picked up in a dense fog and towed into the anchorage. An examination was made in the vicinity of Horse Shoe Shoal Buoy No. 12, where the U. S. S . .111assaclmsctts had grounded a few days before. The hydrographic work between Great Point and Orion Shoal was resumed and completed. A reported shoal spot in the vicinity of Quicks Hole was found and its position determined. Several other shoal spots on the chart were discovered in this locality and their positions determined. The shoal spots were all found in soft bottom and eyidently resulted from a deposit of silt carried from the upper bay through the strong current of Quicks Hole. The buoys in Robinsons Hole were located by using a plane table, and a supplemental survey was made. An examination was made of the western end of L'Hommediett Shoal and the buoys that mark it were located. Eustis Rock and the buoy marking it in Pocasset Harbor, Buzzards Bay, were located. A reported rock in the vicinity of Plum Island, Long Island Sound, was found and located. A reported rock between Hen Island and Scotch Caps was also found and located. A careful search was made for a rock reported to be outside the Hen and Chickens Reef, and the locality was thoroughly sounded and examined with a drag without finding any rock not on the chart. Inquiry at the Larchmont Yacht Club developed the fact that the report was the result of a Yessel running upon the charted reef and being erroneously located. The work closed on September 25 and the Bla!..·c proceeded to Baltimore by way of New York. ·

The position of Cape San Blas Light-House was determined by making the necessary observations at the stations named above. Great changes in the shore line were noted and it was necessary to resurvey it from a point 3 miles northwest of the entrance to West Pass to a point 2 miles east of Cape St. George Light-House. The point of land on the northwestern shore of the entrance has made out to sea about one-half mile and a large lagoon has been formed inside the present shore line. Sand Pass has been closed except at unusually high tides. A party was· placed under the direction of Assistant Latham by the commanding officer and a survey of the shore line in the vicinity of Cape San Blas Light-House was made. The work in the vicinity of West Pass, Apalachicola Bay, was completed on ::\lay 19, and on the following day the vessel proceeded to St. Andrews Bay for the purpose of continuing work in that locality. An examination of the bar and channel showed that the depth of water was not great enough for the ship to eiiter. A party was landed on :May 23 in charge of Assistant Latham and the vessel proceeded to

The old triangulation stations itr this vicinity could not be found and a detached topographic survey of the shore line of the entrance. was completed on May 31 by Assistant Latham. On June 2 a hydrographic party under the direction of Acting Watch Officer Sanger was landed and the ship proceeded to Pensacola and examined the dredged channel in the entrance to the harbor. On June 9 the Bache left Pensacola for St. Andrews Bay, where the hydrographic party came on board, and then proceeded to Key West, arriving there on June r 1. Stormy weather delayed the departure of the vessel until the 15th, on which date she sailed for Baltimore, arriving there on June 19.

The hydrograpliic examination of Chesapeake Bay from Holland Island Bar to the south shore was in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year under the direction of Assistant Young, commanding the steamer Endeavor. The erection of signals was co11tinued until July 10, when in crossing the bay in stormy weather the lower blowpipe of the ship was broken, causing a leak, making it necessary to proceed to Baltimore for repairs. On July 23 the work was resumed and a survey was made of Rappahannock Spit.. In the general hydrographic examination, lines 3 miles apart were sounded north and south and east and west, covering the portion of the bay under examination and extending as far inshore as it was safe to go with the ship. On November 22 the vessel started to Baltimore and stopped on the way to souud two lines across the bay near Great Wicomico River, and also to an examination of a shoal below Smiths Point.

DE1'AILS OF FIELD OPERATIONS.

The vessel reached Baltimore on Kovember 26 and the field work for the season closed. On ::\larch 17, 1902, the Endeavor left Baltimore to take up hydrographic work in the Potomac RiYer, with launch ~o. 23 in tow, and proceeded to Crisfield, Md., where the launch was delivered to the commanding officer of the schooner Jfatcliless. On the way to Crisfield the Endeavor was forced to anchor in the Patuxent Ri,·er off Solomons Island for seyeral days by a strong northwest gale and did not reach Crisfield until the 21st. On March 22 the Endeavor reached· Rockpoint, l\Id., and began "·ork on Kettle Bottom Shoals in the Potomac Riyer. The work assigned to the party extended from Lower Cedar Point Light-House to a point 4 miles below Blakistone Island. The triangulation in this Yicinity had been recently completed and the signals were still standing. It was necessary to remodel these signals for use in the hydrographic work and to establish many additional ones and determine their geographic position. A tide staff was established at Colonial Beach, Va., and high and low water obsenred for nearly two months. The range of the tide at this point is very much affected by wind. Tide obsen·ations were made here previously, but the bench marks to which they were referred had been destroyed and it was necessary to determine a plane of reference to which the soundings could be reduced. Many of the lumps forming the Kettle Bottom Shoals are in the position shown on the charts, but many changes were also developed and changes in the adjacent shore line noted. The Endea'l'Or was absent from the field of work April 3 to 21 on special work, under direction of Assistant \Vainwright, and the work was continued from that date until the close of the fiscal year, when it "·as still in progress.

Magnetic obsen·ations in n1rious localities in the Middle Di\·ision were placed in charge of Assistant L. A.

Bauer was continued in immediate charge of the work at the magnetic observatory at Baldwin, Kans. He had other professional duties which occupied most of his time and could only give about fin~ days each month to the observatory work. The necessary assistance to perform the regular routine work was furnished to him and he supervised the work by personal attention for short periods whenever it was required. In September it became necessary to dismount the instruments and build a more stable foundation. This was successfully· accomplished and the instruments remounted on September 28. After that date th~ record was well made and without interruption. Mt. J. l:VI. Kuehne, August 14 to September 30, made ob~en·ations to determine the magnetic elements and established meridian lines for surveyors' use at the following places: In J<ansas at Olathe; in Oklahoma at Perry; in Texas at Cuero, Edna, Gonzales, Hallettsdlle, Lindenau. and \'ictoria. ·

delivery of the outfit and lumber for the observing tripods and scaffolds. The camp outfit previously used by the parties engaged on this triangulation was shipped to Bowie, Tex., the point selected from which to· extend· the triangulation northward. The officers and outfit reached Bowie on March 10, and three parties were organized without unnecessary delay. A building party \Vas placed under the direction of Signalman Bilby and the erection of signals began immediately and was continued without interruption until the encl of the fiscal year, by which time signals had been completed at all the triangulation points between the Bowie Base in Texas and the Anthony Base in Kansas. Forty obser\"ing tripods and scaffolds, with an aggregate height of r 905 feet, were built by this party before June 30, a most creditable record for all concerned, and especially for Signalman Bilby. Two observing parties were also organized, one under charge of Assistant Bowie, and the other under charge of Assistant Ferguson, as obsen·ers, and five light keepers were instructed 'in their duties. The general plan of operations was to ha,·e two observing parties at work continuously, using both heliotropes and lights and to haYe the building party erect the signals before they were needed by the obsen·ing parties. The following instructions in detail were issued for the guidance of the observers:
In making the measurements of horizontal directions you will measure each direction in the primary scheme sixteen times, a direct and reverse reading being considered one measurement, and sixteen positions of the circle are to be used, corresponding approximately to the following reaclings upon the initial signal:

\Vhen a broken series is observed the missing signals are to be observed later in connection with the chosen initial, or with some othel'one, and only one, of the stations already observed in that series. 2. In selecting the conditions under which to obsen·c primary directions, you slwu!O. proceed upon the assumption that the maximum speed consistent with the requirement that the closing error of a single triangle in the primary scheme shall seldom exceed three seconds, and that the ayerai.;:e closing error shall be but little greater than one second, is what is desired rather than a greater accuracy than that indicated. ·

Under this arrangement each observing party showed a heliotrope by day and a light at night to the other observing party, and each light keeper showed a heliotrope and a light to both the observing parties during the hours of work. M:arks were left at each signal by which the light keepers could mount their heliotropes and lights properly, and they were controlled by the obsen·ers by means of a code of signals. Each observing party consisted of tll.e observer and three men until May 1, when an additional man was added to the party under charge of Assistant Bowie. Each of these parties was fun1ished with a covered spring wagon and two horses, and freight teams were hired in moving from station to station as the work progressed.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

540 kilometers of line complete<!. 89 bench marks established.

The extension of the standard levels of the survey from Bowie, Tex., northward in the vicinity of the ninety-eighth meridian was assigned to \V. H. Burger, aid, Coast and Geodetic Survey. He reached Bowie, Tex., 011 April I, and immediately organized a party consisting of Leland \Vadsworth, jr., recorder, two rodmen, and two hands. The route followed was along the Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific Railway to Medford, Okla., and thence along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to a point 5 miles south of \Vakita, Okla., where the work ended on June 30. A branch line 18 kilometers long was run from Bowie to Bellevue, Tex., to determine the ele\·ation of Bowie Northwest Base, and 32 kilometers of other branch lines "·ere run to determine the elevation of triangulation points and boundary monuments. The elevations of m1111erous bench marks previously established by the United States Geological Sun·ey were determined, and also the elevations of several triangulation stations and of a number of the posts marking the Indian Territory-Oklahoma boundary. The usual method of running levels over the line in both directions was used. Strong and steady winds prevailed during the whole season, and a protection for the instrument against the wind was almost always necessary. This delayed the work, and additional delay was caused by the necessity of often traYeling in the velocipede cars against the wind. The in.strument was found to be remarkably stable when used in strong wind. Temporary bench marks were established at comparatively short inten-als to afford a comparison of the results obtained by each of the two lines, and the elevations of numerous permanent bench marks were determined. The work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. \V. C.

in transit to Cheyenne, so that the obserrntions were delayed until August 1. The route selected was along the Colorado and Southern Railway to Orin Junction, \Vyo., and the work for the season closed at that place on October 15. The party consisted of a recorder, two rodmen, and two hands, and the usual method was followed in executing the work. Velocipede cars w~re used to transport the party to and from work, and between stations during the progress of the work. A canvas-covered frame was used to protect the instrument from wind when necessary, and very little loss of time resulted from strong wind. The line began on two permanent bench marks at Cheyenne and ended on three permanent bench marks established at Orin Junction. Twenty-three permanent bench marks were established during the season, and temporary bench marks were established at short intervals to afford frequent comparisons between the forward and backward lines. The extension of the standard levels in Nebraska was resumed in June by Aid Dibrell, who reached Chadron on June 19. The necessary arrangements were made, a party was organized, and the field work began on the 24th. The line began on the bench marks previously established at that place and was continued to the westward over the Fremont, Elkhorn and l\'lissouri Valley Railway. The line was completed to a point 31 kilometers distant on June 30, the end of the fiscal year.

On July 1 the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian was in progress in Nebraska under charge of Assistant F. D. Granger, \Yho was at work at Station Walnut, one of the points in the Page base net. The observations at this station were completed on July 5, and the following stations were then occupied in the order named: Sparta and Santee in Xebraska, and Avon, Vod, Yankton, \Veiters, and Freeman in South Dakota. The atmospheric condition was very unfavorable for observatioi1s on signal poles, and it is probable that the use of heliotropes would be more economical when the work is continued. All the laborers in this region had continuous employment, and at times it was found to be impossible to secure necessary assistahce in building the observing tripods and scaffolds. In compliance with instructions Assistant Granger connected his work with the triangulation along the Missouri Rh·er, executed under the direction of the Missouri River Commission, and four of the stations, Conger, Ponca, Niobrara, and one (name not known), of the Missouri River triangulation station~ were recovered and observed upon for the purpose of comparing the latitude, longitude, and azimuth as developed in these independent triangulations. Assistant Granger reports the able assistance rendered in the work by Mr. E. E. Torry and Mr. D. A. Lewis, who were employed in his party. On October 28 the work closed and the party was disbanded.

:Magnetic observations were in progress in Texas at the beginning of the fiscal year, with Assistant Little as observer. During the season the determination of the magnetic elements was r·iade at the stations named above. These places were not accessible by means of railroad transportation, and a wagon and team was used in moving from place to place. In addition to the magnetic observations, a meridian line was established and permanently marked by suitable stories. Article 4ro1 of the revised statutes of Texas, .1895, requires each county surveyor to establish a meridian line at the county seat and mark the same at the expense of the county. The county sur\'cyor furnished suitable stones and had them placed in position upon request, and thus greatly facilitated the work. Observations were continued until October 17, when the work for the season closed at Seymour.

The extension of t}le magnetic survey in New Mexico and Texas was assigned to Assistant Preston and he proceeded to Austin, Texas, and arrived there on October 15. At Austin a series of observations were made for the purpose of comparing the magnetic instruments with those at the University of .Texas. The detennination of the magnetic elements was then taken up and observations were made of the stations named above, and meridian lines were established for surveyors' use at the stations marked with a star. The work was delayed by strong wind at times and the difficulties of transportation away from railroads, but steady progress was made until the work closed on April 15. It was necessary to reach many of the stations in an open wagon over extremely rough roads, and in one instance the distance to be traveled was 45 miles .

The work of extending the standard levels west from Page, Nebr., was assigned to Aid Geo. E. Selby. He arrived in O'Neill,.Nebr., on July 12, accompanied by 0. E. Carr, aid, and organized a party for the work. The route followed the Great Northern Railway from Page to O'Neill, and the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railway from O'Neill to Chadron. The line was leveled twice, once in each direction, and temporary bench marks were established at intervals of about one mile to afford a comparison of the elevations resulting from each line of levels. Aid Carr made the observations from July 12 to September 25, and great credit is due him for the rapid progress of the work during this period. His connection with the party terminated on September 26. The work was ~ontinued until November 25, when the work closed at Chadron, Nebr., and the party was disbanded. Three permanent bench marks were established in the vicinity of Chadron to secure a reliable elevation froni which to extend the line. Mr. G. C. Baldwin served as rodman from July 12 to September 11, and his service was entirely satisfactory.

The collection of information necessary for a new edition of the United States Coast Pilot, covering the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington, was assigned to Kautical Expert Ford, as stated in the report for the previous fiscal year, and he was· actively engaged in this work on July 1. During July San Francisco was used as headquarters, and various trips were made to the ports and waters north of that place, using such transportation as the vessels engaged in coastwise traffic afforded. This was the only available means of transportation for the work and had to be used, but it was far from being as expeditious and satisfactory as a vessel specially assigned to the work. All the important points easily reached from San Francisco were visited and all necessary information collected. After some delay on account of the sailors' strike in San Francisco, Mr. Ford went to Portland, Oreg., by rail, and reached there on September 12. The Columbia River and many points on the adjacent coast were visited, with Portland as headquarters, and necessary information covering this region was collected. On October JI Mr. Ford proceeded to Seattle, \Vash., and extended his work over the Puget Sound region, visiting such points as were necessary. After some delay, due to unfavorable weather, in addition to that caused by the necessity of using ordinary means of travel, the work in this region was completed by February 3, and 011 that date Mr. Ford proceeded by sea to San Francisco and extended his work so as to cover San Francisco Bay and the adjacent waters. All necessary work was completed and the work in the field closed on March 1.

Triangulation, topography nnd hydrography. Columbia Rh·er.

The survey of the Columbia River below the Cascades was in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year under the direction of Assistant Morse. .Assistant E. B. Latham was a member of the party during the whole season, and Mr. C. W. Fitzgerald, watch officer, joined the party on July 15 and aided in the work after that date. The different classes of work made steady progress at such times during the season as the conditions permitted them to be most advantageously executed until October 17, when the season closed. The stretch of river from Corbetts Landing to Multnomah Falls is peculiar. Here the river emerges from the Cascade Mountains, and during the summer season the prevailing winds are moderate and draw up the river. In the autumn the winds change and blow down the river most of the time. They are stronger than the summer winds and often blow with great violence-so great that people living along the shore do not try to cross the river in small boats, and even the steamboats sometimes find it difficult to make headway against them. The winds are stronger on the portion between Corbetts Landing-about two miles below Rooster Rock-and Cape

Horn than elsewhere on the riYer. Frequently a strong east wind would blow at this place, often interrupting work, when farther down the river the weather would be favorable. It was this consideration that decided the question of closing work for the season, as it was not thought advisable to continue the work when the rainy season was setting in and rains, ri\:er fogs, and east winds would inevitably cause great delay in the execution of the field work. Assistant Morse expresses his appreciation of the \'aluable assistance rendered during the progress of the work by Messrs. Latham and Fitzgerald.

Hydrograph)·, entrance San Diego Bay, California.

Reported changes in the bar off the entrance to San Diego Bay rendered it necessary to have a hydrographic examination made in this locality, and this work was assigned to Assistant Morse. Mr. C. W. Fitzgerald, watch officer. and Mr. F. G. Crist, deck officer, were instructed. to report to Assistant Morse and aid in the work. The party reached San Diego on January 7, and made all necessary arrangements for the hydrographic work. A tide staff was erected at the tide station previously occupied at La Playa, just inside the entrance to the bay, and another was erected alongside the jetty, outside the entrance, on its west side and about one-third of the length of the jetty from its outer extremity. A forty-eight-hour series of simultaneous tide observations was made at these stations and a plane of reference deduced at the jetty ga~tge which agreed with the plane previously established by the United States engineers.

The necessary signals were erected and on January 17 the bar was visited, but the water was too rough for sounding. Some practice work was done and experiments were made to determine a method by which the gasoline launch engine could be kept going at full speed and still have the speed of the launch reduced sufficiently for sound-· ing work. Past experience with similar launches had shown them most reliable when the engine was kept at full speed, and it was found that this condition could be maintained and the launch kept at proper speed by towing three washtubs, one being towed from each quarter and one amidships, astern. From January 18 to 30 the water on the bar was too rough for sounding, and it continued in this condition, except on January 31, February l, 14, and 15, and :March 4, 5, 12, and 13. The area under examination consisted of a rectangular space about three-fourths of a mile long, north and south, and one-half of a mile wide. \Vith such interruptions in work it was found that changes in the shoals occurred as the result of storm action, and on March 13 as many lines as possible ,\·ere run both north and south and east and west 50 meters apart. Although the lines sounded in this way did not cover the entire area to be surveyed, the work was sufficient to senre the purpose intended, as the bar proper had been satisfactorily surveyed, and the sh<mls to the eastward would probably change again. The work closed on March q. and the party disbanded.

SINCLAIR.

The reconnaissance along the forty-ninth parallel in the Rocky Mountain region of the Northwestern part of the United States was in progress, under the joint auspices of the United States Coast and Geodetic Sun"ey and the United States Geological Survey, at the beginning of the fiscal year, as stated in the previous annual report, at Midway, British Columbia. The azimuth station was placed in line ,on the west bank of Boundary Creek between monument No. 63, 4 191 feet east, and monument No. 66, 5 454 feet west. An azimuth was determined and a meridian line was established and marked with two iron posts. The magnetic declination was determined on three days with a compass declinometer. Boundary mark No. 64 had been torn clown, but the foundation was in good condition and the monument was rebuilt to a height of 5 feet. There was no center mark found in this foundation. All the other boundary marks in this vicinity were in good condition. They are square pyramids of stone, with a base 6 by

6 feet and 5 feet high. The latitude station was 63. 6 feet north of the azimuth station, and the instrument was mounted uu a well-seasoned pine log 6 f-~et loug buried 3 feet in the ground. The astronomic observations were completed at _:\1idway on July 16, and the party moved 12 miles east to Carson, British Columbia, and established a latitude station alongside monument No. 53. The zenith telescope was mounted 011 a piece of dry timber r 2 by r 2 inches and 6 feet long, buried 3 feet in the ground. Latitude, azimuth, and magnetic obsen'ations were made and a meridian liue established and marked by two irou posts, one at the station and the other 204. 7 feet north, not far from a large pine t~ee. An examination of the line was made for a distance of 6 miles to the eastward, and all of the boundary monuments were found in good condition except No. 52. This monument had been torn clown, but the square stone foundation was in good condition and a mound of stone and earth 5 feet high was built over it. On July 29 the party moved ro miles east to monument No. 43, at Russell, where latitude and azimuth observations were made. The zenith telescope was mounted on a dry pine log 14 inches in diameter and 6 feet long buried 2 Yz feet in the ground. A meridiau line was established and marked by two pieces of railroad iron, one placed at the azimuth station on the line 97.9 feet east of monument Ko. 43 and the other r 037 feet north, on the east side of the road. A pile of stones was built around each piece of irou aucl a cross cut on its top to mark the line. The boundary was examined as far east as monument Xo. 40 and as far west as No. 46, and the monuments within these limits found in fair condition. The work on this section of the line was completed on August ro, and the party moved about roo miles east to Phillips, British Columbia. The mark at this place was a wooden center post ro inches in diameter set in the square foundation of a pyramidal stone pile and a vista cut to· the east for half a mile through the woods. This monument is No. 8, according to the American list, and was rebuilt to a height of 8 feet. Latitude, azimuth, and magnetic observations were made. ':!:'he azimuth station was r8o feet east and 6.7 inches north of monument Ko. 8, and was marked by an iron post. A meridian line was established and marked by placing a square tamarack post r 637 meters north of the azimuth station, on the high bench above Phillips Creek, in the edge of the woods. The season was so advauced that it was decided to suspend work on Tobacco Plains · and proceed to \Vigwam Valley to avoid possible delay from early snow on the high divide which it was necessary to cross in order to reach the valley. On August 26 the party started to \:Vigwam Valley by road to Rich's ranch and thence by trail to the valley. The boundary was marked at this place by two pyramidal cairnes in a welldefined vista nearly a mile in length. The eastern monument, No. 6, was well up the slope and the other, Ko. 7, was across the narrow valley on the west slope, nearly half a mile apart. No. 7 was in shape, with some of the stones slightly misplaced, but the entire top of Ko. 6 had fallen down. This monument was built around a decayed stake left in the foundation as a center. The latitude station was established in the valley r 9. 75 inches south and 264 meters ,-.,·est of monument Ko. 6. Latitude, azimuth, and magnetic observations were made. The azimuth station was placed 8. 36 meters east and 1. 75 inches north of monument No. 6, so as to command a view to the \vest, because there was no opening in the forest in any other direction. The tangent was

132

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT,

marked by two iron posts, one at the azimuth station and the other 801 meters to the west on the slope above monument No. 7. A line was cut through the forest for a mile and a half to the summit of the mountain to the east, which overlooks the \'alley of the Flathead, and the tangent was marked by a wooden post set on the summit. A vista was also cut for some distance to the west, so as to get a view of a lofty summit upon which the tangent from Phillips was to be connected with the tangent from Wigwam. \Vith the cooperation of the United States Geological Sun-ey party a junction of these two tangents was made, a line was adjusted between them, and the vista was cut through the forest for the entire distance of r 3.45 miles between the monuments and the adjusted line, marked by iron posts on the prominent summits. An old latitude station, established in r 861, was recovered and verified by new observations. The party left the Wigwam Valley and returned to Phillips on September 26. A vista was opened up the side of the mountain to the first summit to the east and the tangent was marked by an iron post on the summit, which is 3 500 feet above·the plain. The latitude station at East Kootenai was established 324 meters west of monument No. 9 and 905 meters east of monument No. ro. The latitude station of 1861 was half a mile west and r 540 feet south of this station. An azimuth was determined at a point l 79 meters west of monument :No. 9, and a meridian line established from the station 38 l meters long, and both ends marked with an iron post. An iron post was also set on the east bluff of the river bottom 494 meters west of monument No. 9. The old vista on the west side of the Kootenai was cleared nearly to monument Xo. r r, at the base of the main mountain range, and an attempt was made to locate a point on the tangent where it crosses the main didde r 3 miles to the west, but it was found to be impracticable to get pack animals through the dense forest without opening a trail most of the way, and it was too late in the season to uncle~take such a task. The old vista between monuments Xo. 8 and 9 was cleared and an iron post was placed on the parallel about halfway between them. The work was completed on October 12 and the party mo,·ed to \Vaneta, British Columbia, on the Columbia River. A latitude station was located on the west side of · the railroad about 20 meters northwest of the station platform at the small town in United States territory called Boundary. The zenith telescope was mounted on three railroad ties sunk 3 feet in the ground for latitude observations, and azimuth and magnetic observations were also made. On the west side of the ri\·er, about 400 meters from the bank, monument No. 31 was found in a vista. A tangent was passed through this monument and prolonged across the rh·er to the east hank. A piece of railroad iron 6 feet long \ms buried 3 feet in the ground near the latitude station to mark the tangent and a similar piece was set on the high bench to the east so as to presen-e the direction for extending the line. In 1859 and 1860 two monuments, Xos. 29 and 30, were set--011e by the Americans and one by the British representatives-129 yards apart to mark the boundary near this place, but both were destroyed by placer miners who dug up the ground to a depth of 6 or 8 feet. Not far from the astronomic station a quartz bowlder, set on end, with a cross cut on top and the letters" U.S.L.M.," on the south side was found alongside a small pile of stone, probably a mark established by the. General Land Office. Tlie southwest corner of monument No. 31 had fallen down, but the cairn will sen-ewithout

repair as a conspicuous mark for a long time. Monument No. 32, on the first summit west of the Columbia River, was visited and it was found in a \·ery good state of preservation. The old vista up the side of the mountain was plainly distinguishable, but was well grown up and needs clearing as far as monument No. 32. The work closed and the party was disbanded 011 October 19. Assistant 0. B. French joined the party on August 30, and aided in the work from that date to the close of the season.

The hydrographic work was done by Messrs. McGrath and Crist. In Icy Strait the lines of soundings were run abo11t 400 meters apart and the soundings made at intervals of the same distance, the position of each sounding being determined. Near the shore, in the small bays an<f on all shoals and reefs, the soundings were made nearer together and the dangers well developed. The topographic work was clone by Assistant Flynn with \V. H. Burger, aid, as rodman, and was confined to the shore line in order to keep this work up with the hydrography. The position and height of the mountain peaks were determined whenever practicable. The region is densely timbered and rises so abruptly from the shore line that it was impossible to sketch in the contours on the shore where the work was in progress, and the opposite shore was too indistinct to permit this character of \York to be done. The main scheme of triangulation had been completed by the party under direction of Assistant Pratt, and it was only necessary to determine some intermediate positions for the use of the hydrographers and topographers. · Tide ob~ervations were made continuously day and night during the whole season. The work for the season closed on October ro, and the Gedney sailed next day for Sitka, where the launch was stored; and on October 23, after completing all necessary preparations, the Gedney sailed in company with the Patterson and fl1cArflmr for Seattle, and reachea that port on No,·ember r. Assistant Dickins refers as follows to the members of the party:
I found Assistant Flynn to he a very valuable and efficient officer. He took great interest in the work and was always ready and willing to do e\·erything in his power to ach·ance it. He had charge of and executecl all the plar.e table work, assisted in the triangulation and computations, and stood watch when the vessel was under way. In fact, I can not speak too highly of the energetic and faithful manner in which he performed all his duties, and our success during the season was largely due to his assistance. Mr. W. H. Burger, aid, had had very little experience in the work, but he felt an interest in it and was anxious to learn. I found him always ready and willing to undertake all work assigned to him. He assisted in the triangulation, topography, and computations, and performed all his duties faithfully and well. Mr. F. G. Crist, deck officer, was as usual always ready and willing to perform all duties assigned him, and I consider the bydrographic work accomplished largely due to his experience and efforts. He is a good watch officer and attends to all his duties faithfully and well. Dr. \V. \V. Markoe, assistant surgeon, was attentive to his duties and was always ready to stand waf6h or take an active part in the field work .. Mr. James Mitchell, chief oiler in charge, was as usual very careful ancl attenti\·e to all his duties, and kepCeverything in his department in good order. Of the petty officers and crew, with only two exceptions, I can not speak too highly. They got along well together and did their work cheerfully and well.

The magnetic work at Sitka, Alaska, was assigned to H. M. \V. Edmonds, magnetic observer, and he reached Sitka on July 15, 1901. The preliminary preparations for the construction of buildings for a magnetic observatory had been made by J. A. Fleming, aid, before Mr. Edmonds's arriyal. He relieved ?\fr. Fleming and immediately assumed charge of all operations relating to the work. The weather conditions were very unfavorable for the work of constructing the buildings on account of the almost

COAST ,/\Np GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

incessant rain, and the buildings were not completed until October 16. The interior of the building was dried with difficulty, the instruments were installed, and the photographic record of the variation of the magnetic forces began on November 25. While the construction of the observatory was in progress readings were made daily at hourly intervals between 7 a. m. and 3 p. m. at the astronomic observatory for the purpose of determining the magnetic declination. After January 1 a continuous photographic record of the variation in the magnetic declination and horizontal intensity was obtained, with short interruptions for occasional adjustment of instruments. Observations to determine absolute values of the magnetic elements were made every Monday and Thursday, and observations were also made to determine the constants depending upon changes in temperature. Special observations were made at the old station on the Parade Ground for the purpose of referring the observations made in previous years to the observatory. Si>ecial observations were also made at regular intervals in connection with a programme adopted for international work. The two principal sources of diffic.ulty in the work are the prevalence of clouds and dampness. A great deal of time was lost in making attempts to secure observations for time, and many expedients were adopted to minimize the effects of dampness. The work was in successful operation at the close of the fiscal year.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1902.

The survey of the Aleutian Island Passes was in progress on July r under the direction of Assistant Gilbert, commanding the steamer Patil.finder. \Vork in this region is subject to serious delay from unfayorable weather conditions, and for this reason no attempt was made to make the work continuous in one locality until completed, but the different classes of work were done in such places as the weather permitted, and it was often quite fayorable for work in one locality when work would not hm·e been possible elsewhere. Generally the work had t;o be done on the lee shore. During July the work was delayed by the prevailing fogs and was largely restricted to the vicinity of Beayer Inlet and Unalga Island. Tides were obserYed at Unalga Cove and Tagalda Bay. A survey was made of the shore line of Unimak Island, from Scotch Cap to Cape Sari chef, in order to report on :wailable light-house sites in this locality. An examination of this n;gion was requested by the Light-House Board, and this duty was assigned to Assistant Gilbert. The examination was successfully completed and a report made, illustrated with photographs and sketches, which furnished the information desired. On August 3 the triangulation de,·eloped from the base measured at English Bay was connected with the triangulation of Dutch Harbor. As the season ad,·anced and the weather conditions became more favorable, the work was extended and a complete sun·ey of the Passes was completed. The triangulation was extended from Dutch Harbor to embrace points on Unimak Island, and includes the determination of a considerable number of natural objects such as pinnacle rocks and mountain tops. The topography included the shore line of Unalaska Island from Priest Rock to the south entrance to Idagak Strait; Uni111ak Island from Cape Sarichef to Promontory Point, and all the islands between these limits, the larger islands Unalga, Akutan, Akun, Aektok, A\·antanak, Tagalda, and Chirikof. Except some of the south shore of Tagalda, Avatanak, and Biorka islands, and a little of the north shore of Akun Island, all the shore line mentioned was actually run with a plane table. The excepted portion was sketched from the ship and depends on sextant angles and readings of the patent log. Conditions of weather, sea, and wind, as well as the convenience of the other work, largely controlled th~ hydrographic work. Most of the soundings were made with the Kelvin machine, as it was considered more important to cover the whole ground with approximate soundings than to cover a limited area with very accurate work. An automatic tide gauge was erected at Dutch Harbor during the previous fiscal year in May and was maintained until October 5, but it frequently got out of order and could not be repaired until the next visit of the ship, so that there are some unavoidable breaks in the record. Ten day tides were obserYed during June and July at Kashega Bay, Umnak Bay, and Eagle Bay, all bordering on Unmak Pass, or at least nearer that pass than to Unalga Pass. Tides were afterwards observed at Unalga Cove and at Tagalda Bay for about one month. Tides were observed for a few days at Unalaska on a staff connected with the old bench mark in order to connect the automatic gauge record with previoi1s observations. 1fagnetic observations with a compass declinometer were made at a itumber of triangulation stations. A few current observations were made from time to time. The weather conditions improved as the season ad,·anced. During the first two months the tops of the higher hills were rarely ,·isible and the fog frequently settled down to the water, but as the sc:asonadvanced the fog lifted more frequently, and during the last two weeks of September the weather was continuously clear and pleasant, with all the mountains in sight most of the time. At the end of the season there was no snow to be seen except on top of the highest mountains, such

as Akutan Peak and Mount McKuskim. There were not many heavy blows, but it is remarkable that the wind was persistently from the northward, generally from the northwest, and there was a heavy surf most of the time on the shores exposed in this direction. The Bering Sea shores were thus more frequently exposed to storm than the North Pacific shores, but other things being equal the Pacific swell is heavier than the Bering Sea swell. Assistant Gilbert's report also contained yaluable information for the coast pilot of this region. The work for the season closed on September 27 and the vessel proceeded to Dutch Harbor on her way to the Philippine Islands. The following is extracted from Assistant Gilbert's report:
Mr. Yates acted as executive officer until :::\lr. Lyle joined the ship about the middle of September, and was efficient and careful, and the ship has ne\'er been better cared for than while he was serving in that capacity. I desire also to testify to his devotion to any work assigned to him. The triangulation was executed and the base lines were measured by him. :::\lr. Brundage did good sen·ice with the plane table and prO\·ed be was not afraid of hard work. He did the greatest portion of the topography and made the magnetic obsen·ations. Mr. Atkinson took commendable interest in the hydrography, which he planned and executed for the purpose of gathering sufficient data for a reliable chart of the Passt:>s, showing everything important to na,·igation, but without wasting valuable time trying to make the som1ding lines symmetrical. :::\lr. Furman had charge of the sounding machines and was very efficient and attentive to all his duties. '.\lr. J. T. Goldsborough has taken his accustomed interest in the department under his charge arnl it is due to him that the engines and machinery are in most excellent condition. Dr. :::\Iurphy and !lfr. Deichman ba\·e attended to their duties in a most satisfactory manner aml both took regular watches at sea. ::.\Ir. Deichman was especially \'aluable as a signal builder. l\lr. l\lcGregor stood his regular watch at sea and in port and assisted with the sounding machines and sextant work. He is a valuable officer. l\Ir. Pfau has been most industrious and \'aluable.

The sun-ey of Icy Strait and Cross Sound was in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year, under the direction of Assistant Pratt, commanding the steamer Patterson, with Assistant Dickins, commanding the steamer GedneJ', also engaged on the work under his general direction. At the request of Assistant Pratt, Assistant Dickins made the report of the work executed by him direct to the superintendent, and the details of the work are given under his name. All classes of work made as rapid progress as the conditions permitted until the close of the season on October 9. It was important that the sea entrance to Cross Sound and the Passes on each side of the Inian Islands should be completed during the season, and the party remaine.d in the field much later than usual in that latitude for this purpose. In Cross Sound and Icy Strait for a distance covering about So miles there are very few anchorages suitable for vessels: Only four-Swansons Harbor, Hooniah Anchorage, the head of Port Althorp, and Inian Anchorage-were found sufficiently free from ice and strong tidal currents to make them reasonably safe. It was necessary to utilize Bartlett Bay, Dundas Bay, Mud Bay, and Daci Anchorage in spite of the dangers found in them, and Mite Harbor was also utilized, although it was so small that it was necessary to moor the Patterson to trees because there was not room enough for her to swing at anchor. Inian. Anchorage was discovereGl during the season and it has comparatively little ice and no currents. The tidal currents were, as a rule, very strong and tide rips in places were very heavy. These with the ice gathered in solid masses made surveying work in these waters very hazardous. On October ro the Gedney was notified to close operations for the season, and the two vessels proceeded to Sitka, where the steam tender Cosmos and the launch were hauled out of the water and houseq for the winter. The vessels then proceeded to Juneau, where the 111'cArthur was found waiting, and the three vessels made the trip south together, and the Patterson reached Seattle on October 3I.

The survey of Prince \Villiam Sound was in progress on July r under the direction of Assistant Ritter, and the following statement applies to the work of the whole season but the statistics refer only to the work executed after July 1. A base line was measured with a steel tape on the gravel flat in front of the town of Valdes, at the head of Valdes Arm. The profile of the line was obtained by leveling, and each section of the line was measured twice. The triangulation was extended from the line between l\Iakaka and Point Johnstone stations as a base. These stations form a part of the triangulation on the southern shore of Cordova Bay, which started from the Makaka base line on Hawkins Island as stated in previous reports. \Vith this line as a base line, the triangulation was extended over the entire length of Valdes Arm to the town of Valdes at its head. In extending the work to the Valdes base line, stations were so located that any further extension of the

work in latt!ral directions could be done with a minimum amount of trouble and expense. Auxiliary stations were established wherever necessary for the proper control of the shore-lii1e topography, and the positions of all characteristic and prominent mountain peaks were determined. The topographic work consisted in the delinea't:ion of the shore-line and adjacent topography by using a plane table, sextant, and telemeter, and the determination of such salient topographic features as the time and weather permitted. The localities thus mapped included the vicinity of Knowles Head, Goose Island, Snug Corner Cove. Landlocked Bay, Boulder Bay, vicinity of Tatitlack, Virgin Bay, eastern shore of Bligh Island, the northern shore of Valdes Arm from Point Freemantle to Valdes, including the indenting bays and the southern shore of Valdes Arm, including Jacks Bay and Galena Bay. A topographic survey of the town of Valdes was also · made. The area sounded in the hydrographic work comprised the eastern end of Valdes Arm from the Narrows to the town of Valdes at the head of the arm. The general character of this -portion of the arm is that of a deep trough with a flat bottom and steep sides', where the surface is reached at the rocky shore or at the edge of the extensive mud flats which exists at the eastern end and along the north shore of this part of the arm. Tide observations were made for the reduction of soundings. They began on August 8 and continued night and day until September 10. The observations during the day were continued until September 30. Photographic Yiews were made to show the general features of the region and to aid in the recovery of the triangulation stations. The work for the season was closed on October 1 r, when the party left Orea for San Francisco. The assistance rendered by B. A. Baird, aid, in this work recei,·es special commendation from his chief. After making all necessary preparations in 'Washington, San Francisco, and Seattle for continuing the work in Prince 'William Sound, Assistant Ritter proceeded to Orea, Alaska, and reached there on May 3. On May 12 the party r~ached Jacks Bay and established camp. A tide gauge and the necessary hydrographic signals \Yere erected. The hydrographic survey was extended from the point reached during the previous season, to the westward and southv.rard. The work was in progress on June 30, on "·hich date the survey of Galena Bay and Jacks Bay had been completed, and the soundings extended to the westward as far as Rocky Po~nt.

The survey of the Sannak Islands was in progress on July 1 by the party on board the steamer !11cArtlmr, .with Assistant Ferdinand Westdahl in command. The numerous difficulties and dangers encountered in the work caused great delay in its progress and taxed the ingenuity and endurance of the officers and men to the utmost. The daily work proved to be a struggle with wind, rain, or fog, or a combination of these, and frequent changes of anchorage were necessary with a change of direction of the wind, to keep the ship reasonably secure from danger. Camping parties were frequently landed for short periods, and the different classes of work progressed when the weather conditions permitted. On July 26, in passing to the eastward of Cape Pankof, the Pankof Breaker was seen and its position determined. On July 28 the ship steamed to Dora Harbor and the necessary soundings were made on the 30th. Soundings were made in East Anchor Cove on August 3 and the work completed on August 5. On the 7th the work on Ikatan Peninsula was completed. Soundings were made in Acherk Harbor on August I 5 and in Kortheast Harbor on the 23d. Peterson Bay was sounded 011 September 6, and on the 7th and 8th search was made by the ship, with a native otter hunter on board, for outlying rocks in the vicinity of the reported position of Lenard Rock, but nothing was found. rvlany indications of the existence of a submerged ledge were seen, such as seals, otters, birds, and numerous schools of whales and grampus. Erom the statements of the native otter hunter on board and others on shore, both white men and natives, Assistant \Vestdahl reports that he is convinced that a rocky shoal lies somewhere near the reported position of Lenard Rock, that there is only one such shoal instead of three, and that it only breaks in heavy weather during northeast or southwest swell. On September 9 the wind increased to a gale and the search was abandoned. The weather continued stormy and the vessel proceeded to Caton Harbor on the 12th, and the topography of Caton Island was finished on the 15th. On the 16th the \'essel went 10515-03--10

to Acherk Harbor for water, and the weather being clear a sunken rock off the harbor was located. On September 17 the vessel anchored in Otter Cove to resume plane-table work where it had been suspended in July. In landing here through the surf, on a short steep beach of shingle on the southeast face of \Vest Cape Lazaref, the boat was upset and the occupants were thrown into the surf, but all reached the shore.in safety. After many failures a line was floated ashore and the damaged boat was finally hauled through the surf, and later in the day when the tide turned and during a lull in the surf the men on shore waded out to a boat held in the surf and were carried on board · ship. The next morning the instruments and boat gear were brought on board. The season was now drawing to a close, and as a result of local conditions, with a continuous surf, even in offshore winds, the usual method .of surveying the shore line with a plane table had to be abandoned on account of the inaccessible shores, and a reconnaissance survey was made with a boat pulling along the shore with the ship farther offshore determining the position of available objects as signals by the aid of the peaks, etc., already fixed in position by the triangulation previously executed. The officer in charge of the boat sketched the shore line and determined the position of the boat whenever practicable, observing on the ship when anchored, in case it was necessary, while from the ship bluffs and peaks were located and their heights computed. \Vhen the sea became too rough to use the boat the work was continued by the ship . . This reconnaissance was extended .from Otter Co,·e to Scotch Cap Cape, where the reconnaissance joined the ·work of Assistant Gilbert, commanding the Pat!tji11dcr. The Yessel proceeded to Dutch Harbor for coal and water, and on September 29 a search was made for Aleks and Henning rocks. Aleks Rock was found, but no rock was found answering the description of Henning Rock as reported. The ship left Acherk Harbor on the 30th and steered around the outlying breaks to the westward of Sannak and Long islands for a final search, and one new break between this group and I,ong Island was located. The \\·ind increased almost to a gale, further search was abandoned, and the field work closed for the season. The ship then proceeded to Kadiak Bay, on her way to Seattle, and coast pilot notes and sketches were made en route. The following is quoted from the report of Assistant W estdahl:
In the case of the officers who have served in my party during the season in Alaska, I take great pleasure m saying, in addition to what I have stated in my report on the fitness of those who have been detached, that they have rendered good and faithful service to the Survey under most trying conditions of weather. I desire especially to commend Assistant R. L. Faris, for to him is largely due th!! success the party attained in carrying out the instructions of the superintendent. His knowledge of all branches of the work, his untiring zeal and good judgment, and his hearty cooperation with me in taking advantage of every hour of suitable weather to push the work are worthy of all praise.

The work in the Hawaiian Islands, except the Magnetic Observatory, was continued under the direction of Assistant Alexander. He completed a list of all the fish ponds of the islands for the United States Fish Commission, giving the Hawaiian name of each, its area, condition, and present ownership. The index of the native names of the lands and the topographic features of the islands, such as capes, harbors, hays, elevations, rivers, etc., was completed. A set of tracings of the triangulation executed before the annexation of the islands was made and forwarded to the office. A register of the stations occupied in the Hawaiian triangulation was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. An automatic tide gauge was kept in operation throughout the year at Honolulu.

The construction of a magnetic observatory and the installation of the instrumental outfit was assigned to Mr. J. A. Fleming, aid. He arrived at Honolulu on August 7, and began immediately to make the necessary preparations for the erection of buildings. A general magnetic survey had been made of the site selected near Sisal by Assistant L. A. Bauer, Inspector of Magnetic \Vork during the previous fiscal year, by the determination of the magnetic elements at ten stations covering the vicinity of the site. A special survey was made of the selected area of 4.3 acres and the lease of the ground was concluded. A contract was made for the erection of the uecessary buildings, and the work progressed as rapidly as the existing conditions permitted. A well was dug and a windmill erected to supply water, and rill other preliminary \vork w:is completed. The buildings were completed on November 28 and observations \\'ere made to test their nonmagnetic quality. After thorough ventilation the instruments were installed and the regular observatory work began 011 December 3 r. From January 1 the photographic record of the variation in the magnetic elements was continuous until the close of the fiscal year, with such slight interruptions as were necessary in adjusting the instruments. Meteorological observations were made daily and observations for time were made once a week. Observations were made twice. every week to determine the absolute value of the magnetic elements, and special observations were made twice every month as a part of the programme for international magnetic work. William \Vein~·ich, magnetic observer, reported for duty on May ro and assisted in the observatory work after that date. Aid Fleming expresses his appreciation of the kindness and courtesy extended to him by Mr. \V. E. \Vall, sun·eyor-general of the Territory; ::\1r. A. H.

PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

G. R.

PUTNAM.

Th~ important work of surveying the coasts of the Philippine Islands was continued under the direction of Assistant G. R. Putnam, who remained in charge of the Suboffice at Manila, representing the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in all matters of detail requiring immediate decision. In performing this duty he adopted plans for the field operations, issued instructions for field work, compiled all data secured, and prepared and published charts of the waters surveyed. Notices to Mariners and Coast Pilot Notes were prepared and published. He was aided in this work by such advice and instructions issued from Washington as became necessary by the conditions surrounding the work and the necessities of the case required. By act No. 222 of the United States Philippine Commission, passed September 6, I90I, the bureau of Coast and Geodetic Survey was named among the bureaus placed under the executive control of the Department of Commerce and Police, one of the departments of the Philippine government. This act .was subsequently approved, ratified, and confirmed by the United States Congress in "An act temporarily to provide for the administration of the affairs of civil government in the Philippine Islands, and for other purposes," approved July I, 1902. · On January r, 1902, the plan for cooperation between the insular government and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey for the prosecution of survey work in the Philippine Islands was carried into effect, so that during the half year certain classes of expenditures were defrayed by each, the United States paying the salaries, subsistence, and traveling expenses to and from the islands of the officers of its regular corps and of the experts for the Manila office, all expenses connected with the United States steamer at work in the islands, and with all instrumental outfit and stationery sent from the United States, and the expense of printing Philippine charts in Manila and in \Vashington. Since January r the Insular Government has paid the operating expenses of the small steamer purchased by it, the field expenses of the various survey parties on shore, and the expenses of the office in Manila, except the salaries of the offic.:rs and experts above mentioned, and the expense of printing charts. The above plan was followed as being practically the manner of division of expense proposed in the plan approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, and submitted on September 3, 1901, for the consideration of the United States Philippine Commission. Assistant Putuam reported to the Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Police in all matters appertaining to the Insular Government, and has conformed to the regulations of that government in the matter of accounts, property returns, etc. Field parties have been at work almost continuously during the year, as follows, the chief of party being first named: J. J. Gilbert, assistant (steamer Patltfinder), arrived at Manila in November, 1901, and has since been engaged in survey work in the Philippine Islands, under the orders of the Superintendent at Washington. After making important local surveys at Romblon, Cebu, and Ormoc with this vessel, an extended survey of San Bernardino Strait and its eastern approaches, along the north coast of Samar and the southeast coast of

Hill, observer; astronomic determinations of base positions; longitude lines mentioned above; latitudes determined at Zamboanga and Masbate. The field work comprised harbor and channel surveys, the determination of geographic positions, and more extended hydrographic and topographic surveys of the coast. Harbor surveys were made at Santa Cruz, Tabaco, Gubat, and Matnog, on the island of Luzon; Halsey Harbor, on the island of Culion, and at Cebu and Romblon. These surveys included triangulation, hydrographic survey of the water area, and topographic plane-table survey of the shore and immediate vicinity. Hydrographic surveys were made in the vicinity of Manila and Cavite, and at San Fernando and Bolinao, on the west coast of Luzon. Topography and triangulation were carried on in the vicinity of Sorsogon, Luzon. Extended coast surveys, including triangulation, hydrography, and topography, were made in San Bernardino Strait and its eastern approaches, along the coasts of Samar and Luzon; in the vicinity of Albay Gulf, including Rapu Rapu Pass, the northern portion of Port Sula to Tabaco Bay, and the south shore of Albay Gulf, joining the work in San Bernardino Strait; and in Ormoc Bay, Leyte. The triangulation and shore line of Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, were completed. Triangulation and topography were extended about 15 miles to the eastward of Aparri, north coast of Luzon, and a hydrographic survey of the outer anchorage at Aparri was made. Tide observations for use in the hydrographic work, and to furnish data for tide predictions, were made at 19 stations. At Manila these observations were continuous throughout the year, and at several other points the records cover several months. Geographic positions, to establish base points for future surveys, astronomic observations for latitude and longitude, were made at the following points: Legaspi, Sorsogou, Pasacao, Luzon; Masbate; Leyte, Pana)'; Dumaguete, Negros; Catbalogan, Samar; Maasin, Leyte; Misamis and Zamboanga, Mindanao. The longitude determinations were made by the telegraphic method, for which purpose the lines and cables of the Signal Corps were used.

DETAILS OF FIELD OPERATIONS.

Magnetic observations were made at 13 places, to supply the information required for the charts. Where practicable, true meridian lines were established. Office work: At the Manila office of the Survey the work of equipping and supplying the field parties was carried on, preliminary computations were made, charts were prepered for publication by lithography in Manila, notices to mariners of new hydrographic information were prepared and published, the compilation of revised sailing directions for the Philippine Islands was undertaken and one part published, and information was supplied in response to official and other requests. Valuable information was received from the Naval and Military authorities, and from others. The drafting work continued under the immediate direction of Mr. William Welch until his departure for the United States, March 24, 1902. Mr. P. B. Castles arrived on April 2 1, and took charge of this work. The force of Filipino draftsmen was increased from three to six during the last half year, this being found necessary to get out the results of the work promptly. During the year 18 charts, 2 new editions of charts, and and 4 sketches were published by lithography in Manila. The charts have been received from the lithographer and issued. J. C. Dow, acting nautical expert, reported for duty on April 16, and was engaged at the suboffice in the compilation and verification of sailing directions and notices to mariners. Sailing directions for the north and west coasts of Luzon, from Cape Eugano to Manila Bay, were prepared and sent to the printer, and sailing directions for other sections of the Philippine Islands are in preparation. E. R. Frisby, computer, reported for duty on April 21, 1902, and was engaged at the suboffice in revising the computations of work as needed for publication and in general care and examination of the records. The plan proposed for forwarding records to Washington and the retention of the necessary data at Manila was put in force. The force at the Manila suboffice at present consists of r 3 persons, as follows: One as.<>istant in charge, 1 expert computer, 1 nautical expert, 1 chief draftsman, r clerk, 6 junior draftsmen, 1 junior clerk, 1 messenger. During the absence of the Pat!tfinder at Amoy, C. C. Yates, assistant, remained at Manila from April 13 to May 29 and rendered valuable service in revising the proposed scheme for general charts of the Philippines and in getting up a general design for small surveying steamers for work in the Philippines. J. C. Dow, acting nautical expert, assisted in both these matters with valuable suggestions. Mr. Yates also revised various computations and made magnetic comparisons at the observatory. The members of the field force were all at :1\fanila for various short intervals. Messrs. Bach and Gordon, recorders, who reported for duty April 2 I' assisted with the computing work at the office for some time before joining field parties. Information has been received from the naval authorities, army engineers, masters of vessels, and others. Information was supplied from the suboffice, in response to inquiries, to representatives of the various branches of the Government service and to others.

OF RESULTS.

Hydrography: 100 nautical miles of lines sounded. 2 tide stations established. 1 hydrographic sheet completed. Topography: 53 square miles area surveyed. 242 miles of coast line surveyed. 29 miles of roads surveyed. 20 miles of shore line of creeks and rivers surveyed. 5 topographic sheets completed. Triangulation: 69 stations occupied.

A portion of the survey of the coast of the Philippine Islands was assigned to Assistant Denson and he reached Legaspi, island of Luzon, on July r6. A party was organized and field operations began on the 18th and continued until October 6. The progress of the work was seriously delayed by the violent rain storms which are frequent in this region at that season of the year. A small steam launch was hired for use in the hydrographic work, but the launch had previously been engaged by the army authorities and could not be secured on as many days as were necessary to fully develop the approaches to the anchorage, but enough was done to recommend a new course for entering the port, which shortens the distance to be traveled by vessels by 6 miles. An automatic tide gauge was erected in a small river about 200 meters above its mouth, but on the following night a storm of unusual violence so changed the bar at the mouth of the river that the readings were not satisfactory, and a tide staff was erected outside the mouth of the river and connected with the automatic gauge at Tabaco by a series of simultaneous reading on the two gauges through a period of sixty hours. , After completing the work at Legaspi, Assistant Denson and his recorder proceeded to Tabaco. Field operations began there on October 1 7 and continued until December 23, \\·hen the work closed. No hydrographic work was done at this place, as a suitable boat for such work could not be obtained and the north~ast monsoon was prevailing. An automatic tide gauge was erected at Tabaco, and a conti1~uous record covering five 'veeks was obtained. The work accomplished at this place is shown on sketch No. 39. · In January Assistant Denson began the extension of the work done in the Lingayen Gulf during the previous year. Field operations began on January 16 and continued until June 7. \Vork began in the vicinity of Sual and was extended toward Bolinao, at the northwest corner.of the gulf, until a connection was made with the work previously executed at that place. The land at the head of the gulf is flat and is co,·ered, a short distance from the shore, with cocoanut palms, aud in order to avoid the numerous stations and cutting which would have been necessary to carry the triangulation around the shore, the gulf at this point was crossed by a large quadrilateral, which deter-

Survey work in the Philippine Islands was assigned to Assistant J. J. Gilbert, commanding the steamer Patllfinder, and he sailed from Dutch Harbor, Alaska, on October 7, 1901, for Manila, via Yokohama and Nagasaki, Japan. Repairs were made at Nagasaki and the vessel reached Manila on November 17. On the way to Manila the vessel ran close to ''Raleigh Rock,'' referred to in the North Pacific Ocean and Japan Directory, and a photograph of the rock was secured. Assistant Gilbert reports this rock as identical with "Record Island," as described in the volume mentioned above. At Manila, Assistant Gilbert consulted in regard to the work to be done with Assistant Putnam, the director of coast surveys in the Philippine Islands, and called upon Admiral F. K. Rodgers, commanding the fleet, Gen. A. R. Chaffee, commanding the army, and Prof. Dean Worcester, of the provisional government, and consulted with them on the same subject. He and Assistant Putnam then had a meeting with a large number of the masters of the merchant service and discussed the existing conditions and the most pressing demands for immediate work. All agreed that no reliable work had been done on the east coast of the islands, but that it would be impossible to work on that coast during the existing northeast monsoons, which were expected to last several months. The work will be exceedingly difficult at any time on these exposed coasts, as the rainy season begins when the northeast monsoons subside and the rains are very frequent and heavy in this region. At the suggestion of Professor Worcester, Romblon was selected as the place to begin work, and the vessel proceeded to that place, arriving there on November 29. A call was made upon the governor and other officials, and preparations for the survey of the harbor began immediately. A base line was measured, and the triangulation, topography, and hydrography progressed as rapidly as the weather conditions permitted. As soon as the triangulation was completed two days were spent sounding out the harbor and approaches, using the ship. The ship touched on a dangerous reef while engaged in this work, and in getting off the propeller struck a rock and a piece of one of the blades about 1 foot long was broken off.

The work at Romblon closed on December 18 and the ship started the same day for Cebu. In the afternoon of the next day the army transport Liscom was discovered aground near the north end of the island of Cebu, signaling for assistance. An attempt was made to pull the Liscom into deep water, but no suitable towing lines were available, and after the lines parted twice the atte!npt was abandoned and the ship anchored for the night near the Liscom. The next morning the mails and l 20 soldiers were taken on board from the Liscom and carried to Cebu. Soon after the ship reached Cebu, B. A. Baird, aid, and L. H. \Vestdahl, deck officer, repmted on board. On December 21 First Watch Officer Lyle was examined by a board of surgeons and pronounced unfit for duty and was ordered to the hospital at Manila. He was sent to l\fanila in charge of Surgeon Murphy. On December 24 F. H. Brundage, aid, was detached and started to Manila, taking with him the records of the work at Romblon. On the return of Dr. Murphy from ::vranila the Yessel proceeded to Ormoc, on the island of Leyte, where it seemed desirable to take up the next work. Onnoc was found to be the center of disturbance on the island of Leyte, and the party on shore was in constant danger of being fired upon from the woods, which were a short distance hack of the beach, but the natives knew that the party wa1> armed and no attack was made. Work at Ormoe began on January l and was completed on January 26. An astronomic station previously established was occupied with a meridian instrument, which was very carefully placed in the meridian on the only clear night while the work was in progress, and the azimuth thus obtained was transferred to the triangulation the next morning. The topography was limited to the shore line, as the country back of it was occupied by the insurgents and it was not safe to go off the beach. The hydrographic work out to the 10-fathom curve was done with the launch and outside' of this curve with the ship. A tide staff was set up near the beach at Ormoc and permanent bench marks were established. After completing the work at Onnoc the vessel proceeded to Cebu, island of Cebu, in accordance with a request from the commanding general of the army in the southern division of the Philippine Islands, for a survey of that port. The work at Cebu began on January 28 and was completed on March 2 l. A base line was selected and measured and the necessary geographic positions determined by triangulation. The greater portion of the topographic work was very difficult on account of the extensive coral reefs and the bordering mango swamps. The topographic survey was made on a large scale for the benefit of the military authorities, and one of the sheets included the city of Cebu. The hydrographic work at the entrances was done with the ship and the remainder with the launch, except some in shallow places to define reefs and shoals, which was done with a boat. After completing the survey at Cebu the ship proceeded to Manila and thence to Amoy, China, for repairs, leaving Manila on April 12. The repairs were completed and the ship returned to ~fanila 011 May 26. On the 28th C. \V. Fitzgerald, watch officer, and R. H. Hawkes, assistant surgeon, reported 011 board, relieving W. M. Atkinson, watch officer, and J. J. l\lurphy, surgeon. On May 29 L. M. Furman, watch officer, was detached and authority was given to the commanding officer to employ an acting Watch officer. Mr. E. S. Daniels, formeriy na\'igating officer of the army transport Logan, was employed in this capacity and proved himself to be most efficient and desirable.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT,

1902.

The complement of men was filled at Manila, and on June 6 the ship sailed for San Bernardino Strait, where work began on June 9 and was in progress on June 30. A short base line was measured on the island of Viri, from which the triangulation was extended between the islands, and topography of the islands and of Samar completed as far as the village of Bobon. As much hydrographic work as possible was completed, but only the principal channels were developed before the close of the fiscal year. A tide gauge was erected on the island 0f Macarit, but observations were discontinued after two weeks on account of the threatening action of the natives. A gauge was established at San Bernardino Island, where the observations will yield important results. The following statement is extracted from the report of Assistant Gilbert:
All the officers have been faithful workers. Mr. Yates has measured all the base lines, Mr. Baird and :\Ir. Pfau assisting, and at Ormoc am! Cebu assisted in the topographic work and executed the triangulation at San Bernardino Strait. Mr. Baird assisted in the triangulation by building signals and in the topographic work at Ormoc and Cebu by sextant.determination of reef limits, and at San Bernardino Strait did plane-table work. Mr. Atkinson had charge of the hydrographic work with the launch at Ormoc and Cebu, and Mr. Fitzgeral1l had charge of the same work at San Bernardino Strait. :\Ir. Furman had charge of the sou11<ling apparatus until the end of May, when he was succeeded in this work by :\fr. Daniels. Mr. Furman also made current observations at Cebu. Mr. Deichman, besides attending faithfully to his routine duties, assisted in the hydrographic work with the launch and the ship. Mr. Pfau was kept busy by the drafting, which he executed with great care and industry.

Latitude and magnetic observations were made and an azimuth was established at all of these places. Cebu and Ormoc are connected by a submarine cable on which an open circuit is used, but during the exchange of time signals, land-line batteries were put on and a closed circuit substituted. A plane-table sketch of Ormoc and of Maasin was made. At Maasin the sketch included the shore line, a11d some soundings were made at the anchorage off the town. . . At Dumaguete the astronomic station was referred to permanent marks by triangulation. Serious delays during the season resulted from unfavorable weather and while waiting for transportation from station to station. The work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year bet\:een Legaspi and Pasacao, island of Luzon, with Assistant J. E. McGrath at the latter station. In November Mr. Jose Vano Reyes, aid, was detached from the party and ordered to other duty.

A portion of the survey of the coast of the Philippine Islands was assigned to Assistant H. W. Rhodes, commanding the steamer Researcli, and he began field operations in Manila Bay on October ro, 19oi. Hydrographic work in the bay was continued until the 29th, except for a few days when necessary repairs were made to the ship. On October 30 the vessel went to Mariveles Bay and began hydrographic work in this bay and at the entrance to Manila Bay. This work was continued until November 3. After making some necessary repairs to the machinery of the ship at Manila, the vessel proceeded, on November 16, to San Fernando de Union, island of Luzon, and made a hydrographic survey of South Harbor and approaches, including Fagg Reef. From November 29 to December 13 a survey was made of Port Bolinao and approaches. A survey of the harbor and approaches at Santa Cruz was made between December 17 and January 15, and the vessel then returned to Manila for repairs. The work at Santa Cruz developed numerous and extensive coral reefs in the harbor and in the approaches. A narrow channel between two reefs leads to a good anchorage, comparatively close inshore, with good holding ground.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1902.

On February 6 the vessel proceeded to the Island of Culion aucl began th·~ survey of Halsey Harbor. Halsey Harbor, on the west coast of the island of Culion, was found to be an excellent harbor with a good entrance and clear approach. A topographic reconnaissance was made of 'the portion of the island which has hecn proposed as a site for establishing a leper colony. The necessary triangulation, topography, and hydro· graphy were completed on March 25, and a reconnaissance was then made of Pamatusin Cove in Paluan Bay, Island of Mindoro. The vessel returned to Manila for repairs and supplies and then proceeded to Legaspi, Luzon.

A survey of the approaches to Tabaco Bay aud also of the north half of the bay was completed before May 13, on which date Assistant Rhodes was relieved of the comma~d of the ve~sel by Assistant R. B. Derickson. The hydrographic work in Tabaco Bay and entrance showed a fairly good entrance between extensive reefs, with deep water close to the shore, inside the bay. The weather from January to May was generally fair, with a fresh northeast monsoon blowing. The limited capacity on the vessel for storing water seriously delayed the work during the entire season, as it was necessary to replenish the supply frequently, and much time was spent in doing so. Assistant Rhodes states that credit is due the officers of the party for the interest and ability displayed in the execntion of the duties assigned to them. The natives employed as seamen on board the \"cssel in most cases showed an aptitude for the work and gave general satisfaction.

Topogrnphy nnd hydrography, southcnst cons! of Porto Rico.

The continuation of the survey of Porto Rico was assigned to Assistant Faris, and on December 14 he took command of the steamer Blake, relieving Assistant P. A. Welker. Preparations for the field work were made and on December 21, the Blake sailed from Baltimore for San Juan, P. R., en route to l\Iayaguez. The vessel reached l\fayaguez on the 29th and the steam launch Rudy was imtnediately prepared for service. A party was lauded under charge of Assistant Derick.son to

make a hydrographic survey of the harbor and immediate approaches, and on January 1 the JJ!dke returned to San Juan euroute to the southwest coast. The work at Mayaguez was a continuation of the survey begun during the previous year by Assistant G. L. Flower. A tide staff was established and referred to a suitable bench mark, the necessary signals were erected, and the sounding began at the southern extremity of the harbor. The lines were run as nearly perpendicular to the shore line as practicable, at dista:-ices apart of 100 to 150 meters, and these were crossed by lines at similar distances approximately parallel to the shore. The work was completed previous to

January l], and on that date Assistant Derickson was detached from the ship and ordered to other duty. The work assigned to the Blake was the hydrographic survey of the southeast coast of Porto Rico from Arroyo to Point Arenas, including the area offshore to the l 60-fathom curve, and the development of the harbor and anchorages within the limits stated above. On January 6 the topographic work, in charge of Aid Leland, began . at Point Viento, ·and the necessary signals were erected. This work was extended . along l:he coast from Point Viento to Yeguas Point, a distance of about 12 miles, and inland to cover the region visible from the coast line.

DETAILS OF FIELD OPERATIONS.

The hydrographic work assigned to the party, as stated above, was successfully completed. Thirty-two doubtful spots in Vieques Sound were thoroughly examined and carefully developed, including Grampus Shoals. A survey was also made of Port Mulas Harbor and Mosquito Reefs. The survey of Mayaguez Harbor was completed, and White Rock was found, by using a gas-pipe drag, and located. The rock is erroneously located on the Spanish chart of 1898, and this location was thoroughly examined for the purpose of ascertaining whether any such rock existed at the point indicated, but none was found. A special development of Mondango Reef, Mayaguez Harbor, was also made and the position of the ranges used in entering the harbor was determined. The hydrography off Boca Quebrada Point, on the south side of Arenas Point anchorage, was developed in order to complete the survey of the anchorage. At no time during the season was it found to be practicable to make soundings from a rowboat, and much of the work with the ship was done in a heavy swell. The special hydrographic work in Fajardo Roads and vicinity included the examination of twenty-six shoals. Tide obsenratlons were made at Mayaguez, Point Tuna, Santiago Cay, and Port Mulas. A comparison of the tidal planes was made by simultaneous observations at Point Tuna and Santiago Cay, at Point Tuna and Port Mulas, and at Mayaguez and Puerto Real. The work closed on May 29, and on June 3 the vessel sailed from San Juan for Baltimore and reached that place on June 10. The following is quoted from the report of Assistant Faris:
I wish to commend the officers under my command for their zealous attention and intelligent performance of their duties, and for their readiness to assist me in every way in their power. I desire to make special mention of First \Vatch Officer Chas. Lyman for his work in always keeping the ship in a neat and healthy condition, and in always having the vessel ready for the work in hand. I also heartily commend Mr. George Olsen for his excellent and 'efficient work throughout the entire season in charge of the steam launch used in the hydrographic work. His work was perfonned with intelligence, zeal, and close attention to duty. Much of the launch work was on an exposed coast and the sea was frequently rough, thus rendering the work exceptionally arduous.

Triangulation: 103 square miles area covered. 18 stations occupied. 38 geographic positions determined.

The completion of the triangulation and topographic sun·ey along the north coast of Porto Rico, between San Juan and Palominos Island, was assigned to Assistant Nelson. He procured outfit and stores in New York, and sailed for Porto Rico on December 2 1, and reached San Juan on the 26th. A party was organized, and the necessary transportation was secured from the Quartermaster's Department of the U. S. Army: Field operations began on January 1, and the work was completed on April 7. The line from El Moro to Latimer, which it was necessary to use as a base for the work, was unfavorably located, and considerable time was spent in making a reconnaissance to carry the triangulation to the eastward. During January the rain was almost continuous, with more than 15 inches of rainfall and only four fair clays. The plane table work began on February 1 and was continued to the end of the season whenever the weather conditions permitted. It was necessary to establish camps in three places during the season, and the camp outfit was moved with considerable difficulty and delay. From San Juan to Memelle there is a military road in good condition, but there are no bridges over the principal streams, and the fords are rough and dangerous, some of them becoming impassable when the streams are flooded. From Memelle to Fajardo the rough and sandy road becomes almost impassable during the wet season. The constant and heavy trade winds greatly delayed the work.

Assistant Nelson reports the valuable service rendered by W. C. Dibrell, aid, F. C. Aid Dibrell was with the party from the beginning of the season until March 17, and extended the topography from San Juan to the Boca de Rio Grande. He was relieved from duty in the party on March r7, and Draftsman Donn took his place and continued the topographic work to Pt. San Diego, where it joined the work previously completed. In accordance with later instructions, after completing the work mentioned Assistant Nelson moved his party to Fajardo after making all necessary arrangements for a survey of Mona Island. The party was taken on board the Coast and Geodetic steamer Blake, Assistant R. L. Faris commanding, and transported to Mona Island, but the heavy sea in the vicinity of the island made it impracticable to land the party and outfit, and as there was no prospect of more favorable conditions in the near future, the attempt was abandoned and the vessel proceeded to Mayaguez and thence to San Juan, where the outfit was dried and shipped to Washington. The party was disbanded and Assistant Nelson left San Juan for Washington on April 30.

SPECIAL DUTY.
RESURVEY OF l\IASON AND DIXON'S LINE. l\IARYLAND. PENNSYLVANIA.

W. C.

HODGKINS.

The resurvey of Mason and Dixon's line, the boundary line between the States of Maryland and Pennsylvania, was in active progress at the close of the last fiscal year, as stated in the previous annual report, under the direction of Assistant W. C. Hodgkins. The methods adopted in the field were intended to secure an exact reproduction of the work of Mason aJ!d Dixo~ without any attempt to correct any of the a~cidental inaccuracies by which it was affected from errors of observation or of measurement in running the trial line and in marking the curved boundary. This plan was practicable because the original notes contain data referring the various monuments established to a straight line lying close_ to the boundary. A large proportion of the old monuments were found in place, but a large number of them had been broken or seriously-mutilated, a_nd nearly all of them were no longer standing in a vertical position. A considerable number of the original monuments were found out of the ground and some of them had been removed or destroyed. All of the monuments found in position were carefully reset in substantial bases of concrete, after being restored to as good a condition as possible, and will last for a long period if not intentionally destroyed. While running the trial line, notes and sketches were made for the purpose of preparing a topographic delineation of the country in the immediate vicinity of the boundary. The detailed survey of the natural and artificial features of the country immediately adjoining the boundary line was advanced from the vicinity of Littlestown, Pa., to the Susquehanna River. All of the missing monuments in that distance were relocated and replaced in their proper position on the line. This work was completed about the middle of June, and the party was then moved to Hancock, Md., and similar work in that vicinity was in active progress at the close of the year. Assistant Hodgkins was absent on duty connected with the Virginia-Tennessee boundary work from July I6 to October 31, but the work on the illason and Dixon's line was continued during this period by his party working under his direction. He reports the diligent and satisfactory service rendered by Mr. Robert H. Blain and 1\Ir. Edward R. Martin, who assisted him in the work.

and good progress was made until November 4, when the field operations closed for the winter. The greater portion of this time was consumed in the location of that portion of the boundary which lies in the mountainous district between the Holston River and the northeastern corner of Tennessee, where the country is extremely rough and generally densely wooded and where, on account of serious disputes as to the true location of the boundary, it was found necessary to run two trial lines, about a mile and a half apart, across an extensive series of formidable ridges. Frequent rains also retarded operations, and it was not until September 21 that the party could return to Bristol and start westward toward Cumberland Gap. On the section west of Bristol the conditions of the country and the weather were much more favorable, and the work was extended to the Clinch River by the end of October. Assistant Hodgkins was absent on other duty from July r to 15. At the close of work for the winter the boundary line had been retraced from the White TopJ\fountains, at the northeast corner of Tennessee, to the Clinch River and marked by durable stone monuments at all the public highways. The trees adjacent to the line were also marked. Assistant Baylor resumed work on the boundary on June 18 and the work was actively, in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

The necessary preliminary arrangements were made in \Vashington, and on December 3 he proceeded to Charleston and took up the work of installing the exhibit under the direction of the chief special agent of the Treasury Department. This was successfully accomplished, and Assistant Eimbeck continued in charge until the exposition closed on May 30, 1902. He then proceeded to \Vashington and reported to the Superh1t~ndent on June 5.

surveys. The Dunnellon Phosphate Company agreed to furnish all assistance, boats, and material required and to pay all necessary expenses of the sun·ey. Assistant Marindin reached Dunnellon on September 24 and began the work of recovering some of the stations of the triangulation established in this region in 1856 and 1857. Many of the old station marks had been removed or destroyed. After searching diligently for a considerable time, two stations were recovered, both of which

had been established on rocks lying off. shore and submerged at high tide, and the line between them was used as a base from which to start the work. The triangulation was extended from the line Cormorant Rock to Basin Rock, by means of stations on shore and in the water, to a point beyond the mouth of the \Vithlacoochee River. A topographic survey was made of the shore line in the vicinity of the channel established by dredging and of the islands at the mouth of the river. It was necessary to suspend work in order to allow Assistant Marindin to attend a meeting of the Mississippi River Commission, and he was absent from Novem~er 2 to November 20, when he returned and resumed work. Assistant 0. W. Ferguson reported to Assistant Marindin on November 26, and remained until the completion of the work on January 2+ The proposed anchorage was from 8 to r 3 miles off shore and it was necessary to establish and determine t\VO lines of '' water signals'' or signals erected off shore for use in the hydrographic work. A tide staff was erected at Cedar Keys and referred to the tidal bench mark at that place and at the mouth of the \Vithlacoochee River and a tidal plane established by simultaneous observations at these places. This work was the result of the attempt of the Port Inglis Terminal Company and the Dunnellon Phosphate Company to systematically improve the mouth of the \Vithlacoochee River at their own expense under authority of Congress.

Assistant Marindin continued his service as a member of the Mississippi River Commission under the appointment of the President, and performed such duties during the year as were necessary: On November 3 he proceeded to St. Louis, Mo., to attend a meeting of the Commission and then went on a trip of inspection down the river to New Orleans, returning to other duty on November 20. From March 3r to April r r, he was attending a meeting of the Commission at St. Louis and inspecting the work along the river to New Orleans. Most of his time when not actively engaged in field work was spent in attending to the work of the Commission, and from June 20 to 29 he was again attending a meeting of the Commission in St. Louis.

On July I Assistant \Vainwright was on duty at Buffalo, N. Y., in charge of the exhibit of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at the Pan-American .Exposition. Numerous visitors examined the exhibit with great interest, and the plate-printing outfit, the tide model, and the chronograph, which were in regular operation, attracted particular attention. The chronograph was in electric circuit with the Western Union time service, and signalS sent out daily at noon from the Xaval Observatory at Washington were received and recorded. Leaflets printed in English and Spanish, describing the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, were presented to all who cared to have them, and there was. an almost constant demand for verbal explanation of the instruments and apparatus. Assistant \Vainwright continued on duty in charge of the exhibit until September 1, when he was relieved by Assistant Eimbeck, whu took charge on that day and remained in charge until the close of the exposition on November 2. He remained at Buffalo until November 6 engaged in preparing the exhibit for shipment, and then proceeded to \Vashington and reported to the Superintendent on November 8.

The computation of the framework of the triangulation in southeastern Alaska, from the head of Lynn Canal to Port Simpson, and comprising about 1, 600 points, on a uniform standard, was completed. The computation of the primary triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian from the thirty-ninth parallel northward to the Page Base in Nebrask,a, including vertical as well as horizontal measures, was completed. The work of reducing the triangulation by the United States Lake Survey from western New York to the Olney Base in Illinois and along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River to conformity with the triangulation by the Coast and Geodetic Survey already computed upon the United States Standard Datum, was begun in October and completed before the close of the fiscal year, but the preparation of the formal report upon the work and the preparation of the list of positions for publication remained to be done. This work fixed the position of about 1, 700 points, which were added in this

way to the register of geographic positions maintained by the Suryey. The work was done by cooperation between the Lake Survey and the Coast and Geodetic Survey, regular members of the Computing Division doing the difficult work of making the more complicated adjustments and aiding in the preparation of the final lists, while computers from the Detroit office of the Lake Survey did the remainder of the work, the following persons being employed for the time stated: T. Russel, No\·ember 25 to June 30; A. D. Hollingsworth, December 19 to May 24, and \V. R. Caldwell, January 2 to May 24. During the year the manuscript of the following appendices to the Report for i 901 was prepared for publication: Appendix 3. The measurement of nine base lines along the ninety-eighth meridian. Appendix 4. Extension of tables for the computation of geodetic positions to the equator. Appendix 5. Determination of the relative values of gravity in Europe and the United States. Appendix 6. Triangulation northward along the ninety-eighth meridian in Kansas and Nebraska. The routine work of furnishing information to parties in the field and to persons outside the Survey in response to requests was very heayy and still continues to increase, the dem?nd for geodetic positions having been 30 per cent larger and for descriptions of stations 38 per cent larger than during the preceding year. The result of the temporary details from the field force brought the average effective force of the Division up to I l besides the chief, an~ this average effective force varied from 4 in August to 17 in March. ~fr. Baldwin acted as Chief of Division from January 27 to 30 and from March 25 to April 27, and his sen·ice during the year is highly commended by his Chief, who states that his intimate knowledge of both field and office methods and his good judgment, partly the result of his experience in the field, c~mbined with his unusual ability and energy, made his services especially yaluable. The other members of the Division received commendation, and their Chief states with pleasure and pride his belief that on the whole each member rendered zealous, efficient, and interested service throughout the year. Mr. E. H. Courtenay, the senior computer, died on June 3, 1902, after forty years of valuable sen·ice. Mr. Courtenay's death is recorded under the heading "Report of the Superintendent.'' 10515-03--13

The revision of computation of declination, latitude, and longitude of magnetic stations occupied was kept up to date and as soon as the observatory monthly tabulations became available the observed declinations were corrected for diurnal variation. New discussions of the secular change of declination were made at the repeat stations where observations were made during the year. From all the available analytical expressions, it was possible to determine the general distribution of the phases and amplitude of the secular motion in the United States, and hence to deduce a formula expressing the secular change in any desired locality. Such formulre were deduced for one or more places in each State and Territory, and from them tables were derived giving the decennial values of declination and the present annual change. By means of these tables the observed values of declination in the Declination Tables were reduced to January r, 1902. The computed values of annual change as well as those resulting directly from observations were plotted and lines of equal annual change drawn in the same manner as the lines on an isogonic chart. In February a new chart showing the lines of equal magnetic declination and of equal annual change in the United States for January 1, 1902, was completed. A volume of 400 pages under the title "United States Declination Tables and Isogonic Charts for 1902 and Principal Facts Relating to the Earth's Magnetism" was completed for publication. The descriptions of all magnetic stations occupied by the Coast and Geodetic Survey observers between 1881 and June 30, 1902, were included in the volume, thus bringing the publication of the descriptions of stations up to the date stated. The observations made at the time of the solar eclipse of May 17-18 were discussed and a preliminary report was prepared. A number of magnetic instruments were compared and the constants of several others were determined and tabulated. Directions for keeping and transmitting the records of observations made at observatories and general directions for making magnetic observations in the field were prepared. The routine .work of the Division was nearly double that of the previous year.

This work is equivalent to first reductions for about thirty-five years of continuous high and low water. Harmonic analyses were completed for a year each of hourly ordinates at 3 stations, and also for 36 short series. This.work, when the work in progress at the close of the fiscal year is included, is equivalent to the complete analysis of ten years of continuous record. The plane of reference for the reduction of soundings was detem1ined for 65 stations. About twenty-four years of automatic tide-gauge record were tabulated as high and low waters, and also as hourly heights of the sea. Tide notes were prepared for 2 Is stations upon 49 charts and 58 hydrographic sheets. Tidal information was furnished to the field parties and in response to requests from individuals not connected with the Survey, in 230 instances, involving the preparation of the description of 326 bench marks and tidal data for 862 stations. Harmonic analysis was made for six months of automatic tide gauge record at Manila, P. I., and a manuscript copy of predicted tides for that port for the year 1902 was prepared for the use of the officer in charge o!. the suboffice at that place. Copies of the predicted tides for Wellington and Port. Russell, New Zealand, with tidal differences and constants for 60 subordinate stations, were prepared and furnished in response to a request from the Secretary of the Marine Department of New Zealand. The proof of Appendix No. 7, Report for 1900, "Outlines of Tidal Theory," was read by Mr. Harris, and he continued his studies of the various physical laws involved in the'proper discussion and reduction of tidal observations. The volume of Tide Tables for the year 1903 was prepared for printing, and the greater portion of the proof was read before Jun~ 30. In this volume full predictions for Wellington, New Zealand, were included for the first time. There were received, examined, and registered an aggregate of about fifteen years of record from automatic tide gauges at 24 stations, together with about five years of

record from box and staff gauges, consisting of 102 volumes of tide observations made by 24 hydrographic parties at 96 stations. Of the above, automatic tide-gauge records covering one year were received from the station at Reedy Island, Delaware, maintained by the Philadelphia Maritime Exchange, two ~·ears' records from the United States engineers at Charleston. S. C., and the Navy Department loaned the Survey one year's record at the New London .Naval Sation and one year's record at Olongapo, Subig Bay, P. I.

This Division is divided into five sections-the Drawing, the Engraving, the Printing, the Photographing, and the Electrotyping sections. Each section executed the work indicated by its title and the combined result is shown by the charts published and issued by the Survey. During the year 31 I requests for information were received and answered in the Division. The work involved the measurement of areas, shore-line, distances between various points, the preparation of tracings from original topographic and hydrographic sheets, copies of old and canceled charts, negatives, blue prints, and the construction of special maps.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1902.

In addition to the foregoing, 564 charts were revised (includes second and third revision of the same chart), corrected, and verified for new editions or new prints. Forty-eight hydrographic projections were constructed for the use of the field parties or in the Office. Two hundred and forty-four topographic and 269 hydrographic sheets were inked, lettered, plotted, revised, or made ready for approval and filing. A large number of illustrations, including 68 sketches and 15 photographs, were prepared for publication in the' Annual Report of the Superintendent for 1901, and 35 sketches were prepared for the Report for 1902. The history sheets maintained in connection with all 11ew charts, new editions, and corrections to charts provide a very valuable source of information, and it is comparatively easy to ascertain from them any desired information concerning the charts. The use of the standard alphabet with spacing device greatly facilitated the work of lettering. The plate of slanting Roman letters was completed. A large portion of the title and notes for field sheets was transferred to them by the use of negatives from these sheets of letters, and a great saving in the expense of this item was effected. In connection with the new charts of San Francisco Bay, the larger scale charts were completed first and the drawings were then reduced by photography to the scale required for the smaller scale charts, thus enabling the draftsmen to trace directly instead of drawing by the use of squares. The publication of preliminary editions of charts was in many instances greatly facilitated and hastened by com~ination of drawings and engraved plates, the shore line, hydrography, and curves of equal depth being engraved, and the topography being put in place by photolithography. In connection with the new heliogravure process it was found desirable to make the drawing on a larger scale than that desired for the chart and make the necessary reduction by photography. The personnel of the section showed steady improvement and interest in their work.

During the year a large number of plates were required for new editions, and in nearly all instances new bassos were brought up from earlier altos whieh were not worn by use. This necessitated a large amount of work to bring the new basso up to date, but was necessary in order to keep the printing plates up to full strength.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1902.

The introduction, toward the close of the year, of a negative plate of the standard Roman alphabet, with spacing device, made it possible to transfer, by the use of wax, titles and general lettering to the copper plates much more rapidly than it is possible to construct each letter. The Chief Engraver, Mr. W. A. Thompson, died on July 22, 1902, after a long and faithful service. A record of his service appears under the heading, '' Report of the Superintendent."

During the year the files of bond proofs from all the plates made by the Survey, except the four-plate map of the District of Columbia, were completed. Previous to the month of June charts were printed in sufficient numbers to supply the current demand promptly, but in June the number ordered by the Navy Department was unusually heavy, averaging 391 charts per day, and this, with the current demand for other purposes, exceeded the printing capacity of the Section.

During the year the facilities in this section were largely increased. An experimental "Daniels Cell " was installed to be used in connection with the Austrian heliogravure process of reproducing negatives on copper plates, and one new plate was completed by Messrs. Blacklidge and Keyser. The plate was published with very little additional hand work, which included engraving one short note and the correction of a few minor defects. As a whole it proved successful, though the chart has more the appearance of a photolithograph than a print from an engraved plate, as the lines were all more or less broadened by the process. A process of transferring drawings to copper plates for· engraving was perfected, using a tracing and printing on the copper with a hard purple ground, leaving the work clear and bare. Messrs. Blacklidge and Keyser deserve great credit for the development of this process of transfer. A large number of original sheets and large scale drawings were reduced by photography for the use of the Drawing Section.

The demand for new alto and basso plates was supplied with difficulty on account of the condition of the plant. Before the close of the fiscal year a new plant was ordered with greatly increased facilities and all modern improvements.

The Chid of Division supervised the work of the two sections into which the Division is divided, gave personal attention to the inspection of new charts and new editions of charts in their various stages of progress, and prepared a new edition of the chart catalogue for publication.
CHART SECTION..

In this Section all letters relating to the sale of charts and tide tables were prepared, the accounts with the sales agents were kept, the buoys on the charts were colored, and other routine work was done. A few changes in the list agencies for the sale of charts were made and 5 additional agencies were established, bringing the total number in existence on June 30 up to '1 So. Editions of 32 new chart~. 31 printed by photolithography and one from copperplate, were issued during the year. Forty-eight new editions of charts, 34 printed from copperplate and 14 by photolithography, were also issued. Charts were received as follows:

A comparison of the total issue of charts for the fiscal year with the issue in previous years, except for the years 1898 and 1899, when the issue for governmental purposes was abnormal, shows the total to be much larger than that of any other year and 30 per cent larger than the average annual issue. The above statement does not include the charts published and issued at the Su boffice in Manila, except those sent to \Vashington for distribution.
HYDROGRAPHIC SECTION.

The work of indicating the chart corrections and preparing the monthly Notices to Mariners was performed with marked ability by Mr. \Vyvill. Mr. Willenbucher was employed in plotting and verifying field sheets, in the revision and verification of proofs, chart:;, and drawings, and on other miscellaneous work, which included the supen·ision of the work of various draftsmen temporarily detailed to duty in the Division.

The energy of the Instrument Division during the year was largely devoted to repairing the numerous instruments in use by the field parties of the survey. During the year 1 209 ins.tntments were cleaned, adjusted, and sent to the field. Work on new instruments was done whenever more pressing duties permitted, and progress was made on the construction of r 2 new plane table alidades. Thirty-six acetylene signal lamps were constructed for use in triangulation. Twenty-four of these were tested by use in the field, and served the purpose for which they were constructed most admirably. Extensive changes and additions .to meridian telescope No. 7, for use in the Philippines, ·were completed. A new leveling instrument similar to those described in Appendix 6, Report for 1900, was constructed. Apparatus was designed and constructed for the purpose of adapting the time sending and recording instrument used in telegraphic longitude work to the instruments used in the Marconi system of wireless telegraphy, and satisfactory signals were obtained in experimental work between Nantucket Island and Nantucket light-ship and also off the coast of Long Island, New York. Mr. Fischer took part in the experiments

206

COAST AND GEODETIC SVRVEY REPORT,

off Long Island. Apparatus was designed and constructed to facilitate and increase the accuracy of reading the photographic traces made in magnetic observatories by the self-recording instruments. The usual routine work of the Division, such as accounting for the property of the Survey for field use, repairs to office buildings and furniture, packing instruments for shipment, etc., was kept up to date. It is gratifying to state that apparatus and instruments designed and made by the Survey for its own use continue to meet with the approval of scientists abroad, as shown by orders to American firms to construct similar instruments from the models furnished by the Survey and under the inspection of its officers. During the year a half-second pendulum, a leveling instrument, a 5-meter iced bar, and a base tape apparatus were constructed as stated for the chief astronomer of the Dominion of Canada, under the supervision of Mr. Fischer. He also inspected several astronomical instruments constructed for the National Observatory of Mexico for final acceptance before shipment to Mexico. He was appointed a meinber of the jury of awards on machinery at the PanAmerican Exposition, and served in that capacity during his vacation. W. R. Whitman was detailed for duty under the National Bureau of Standards during the whole year. Mr. Fischer reports that the employees in the Division showed a commendable zeal and conscientious interest in the performance of their various duties.

A working cooperation was effected with the Library of Congress, the card catalogue was revised and enlarged, and undesired literature was eliminated by transfer to the Library of Cougress and to other bureaus of the Government. The indexing of all the magnetic triangulation and hypsometric records and computations involving the preparation of about 12 ooo index entries was completed. These entries have been sorted and filed in two indexes, one of localities showing where the work was done, and the other of subjects, showing the records and computations in each class of work. The indexes are provided with numerous cross references from larger to smaller divisions and to variations in names. The set of British Admiralty Charts was arranged according to the new British Admiralty numbers, which assembles them in correct geographical order, as shown in the chart index. The series of miscellaneous maps covering the United States were listed in a map register showing the size and scale. A valuable set of military maps was received from the Imperial Austrian Geographic Institute.

The preparation of a complete list and catalogue of the publications prepared ani issued by the Survey was undertaken and about three-fourths of the work was completed. Numerous requests for information were answered and the routine work of the library was kept up to date. Some of the rooms for filing the archives were assigned to the use of the National Bureau of Standards, and the removal and rearrangement of the records involved the use of a great deal of the time of a portion of the library force. More than three thousand ''Standard'' charts showing manuscript corrections were received and filed. A large number of tracings of original hydrographic and topographic sheets were transferred to the library during the year, and all of these were registered and placed on file.

TRIANGULATIO~

IN KANSAS.

By JOHN F. HAYFORD, /11spator of Geodetic Work; Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey.

GENERAI, STATElllENT.

The primary purpose of this appendix is to bring together in convenient form for the use of engineers, information in regard to all the triangulation by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the State of Kansas. There is also included herein a full report on one additional section of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation, two sections between bases having already been published in J\ppendix 6 of the Report for 1901, entitled, ''Triangulation Northward Along the Ninety-Eighth Meridian in Kansas and Nebraska.'' The occasion for the publication of this appendix now is the completion to the Kansas-Oklahoma line in the summ~r of 1902 of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation southward from the thirty-ninth parallel. It" contains some matter which is a repetition of what has already been published and which is repeated here for the sake of completeness. The engineer upon his working ground, intent only upon finding the necessary information to enable him to extend this triangulation or to base other surveys upon it, need consult only the latter part of this appendix, commencing with the explanation of the positions, lengths, and azimuths. The earlier portions set forth briefly the history of the work, the details of office and field methods, and the degree of accuracy secured in each part of the work. The transcontinental triangulation, extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific along the thirty-ninth parallel, and the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation both cross Kansas and pass through its central portion. These two triangulations are to form the main framework for the control of all triangulation in the United States. The portion of the transcontinental triangulation within the limits of the State of Kansas was commenced in 1885 and finished in 1896, having been· in progress during this whole interval except during 1886, 1894, and 1895. A full account of the transcontinental triangulation has been published, in so far as the features of special interest to the scientists are concerned.* Only the positions for the primary stations were there published, and but few descriptions of stations. The positions of all the!.'e stations, primary,' secondary, and tertiary, are published herein on the United States Standard Datum, together with all available descriptions. The portion of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation which lies in Kansas and to the northward of the transcontinental triangulation was executed in 1897 and 1898, and an account of it has been published, together with that portion of the transcontinental ---------·-- - --- ----------~-. ------·-----.--.---------------~

triangulation, which also forms a part of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation, in Appendix 6 of 1901, already referred to above. The positions, descriptions, and elevations of stations in this triangulation are here reproduced for the sake of completeness. The portion of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation which lies in Kansas and to .the southwa~d of the transcontinental triangulation was executed during the year;;; 1899-1902, and now appears in print for the first time. This work was completed in 1902 by the occupation of three stations near the Kansas-Oklahoma line, which ser\'ed to finish the connection with the Anthony base. The party which occupied these three stations continued the ninety-eighth m~ridian triangulation more than 400 miles, or 6 degrees of latitude, farther south to the Lampasas Base in Texas, during the season of 1902. This triangulation to the southward of the Kansas-Oklahoma line not being ready for publication at this time will be presented in a later report. The reconnaissance from the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation southward to stations Arlington and Sunflower was made by Assistant William Eimbeck in the summer of 1899. At ·those stations it joined the reconnaissance carried northward from the vicinity of El Reno, Okla., by Assistant Stehman Forney during the same season. Many different members of the Computing Division have taken part in the preparation of this appendix, Special acknowledgment seems proper for the services of Mr. M. H. Doolittle, who made the least square adjustment of the primary triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian in Kansas, and to Mr. A. L. Baldwin, who has supervised the minor computations and the compilation of the results.
THE METHODS AND INSTRUMRNTS USED IN THE ANGLES.
MEASURE~IENT

OF HORIZONTAL

All of the angle measures were made by the direction method. Each series of observations consists of successive pointings on the various stations in order, from left to right, with corresponding readings of the horizontal circle with three micrometer microscopes followed immediately by pointings on the same stations in the reverse order after reversing the position of the telescope by transiting it through the wyes and turning the alidade 180° in azimuth, each pivot remaining in contact with the same wye as before. Each observation of an angle consists, therefore, of two pointings on each station involved, one in each position of the telescope, together with the corresponding micrometer readings, 24 in all, both a forward and a backward reading of each micrometer being rnade in each of its positions. At each station along the transcontinental triangulation from the Kansas-Missouri state line as far westward as the stations Big Creek and Schmidt, except at the four stations mentioned below in the Salina base net, the observations were taken by Assistant F. D. Granger, assisted occasionally by a second observer, during the years- 1885 and 1886-93· Theo<;lolite No. IO was used in seventeen positions and two series of observations were taken in each position, making the total number of measures of each angle 34. The horizontal circle of this theodolite is 35 centimeters in diameter and carries a 10' graduation read directly by three micrometer microscopes to single seconds. The telescope has a clear aperture of 5.4 centimeters ( 2 ,78 inches), a focal length of 6z. 6 centimeters ( 24 ;.( inches), and a magnifying power of 36. As a rule the observations were made during the afternoon hours of every favorable day. The sigirnls employed

were poles 20 feet long and 4 inches in diameter, heliotropes being rarely used except on the long lines during smoky weather. The theodolite was elevated at nearly every station east of the Salina Base, the average height above the ground being about 8 meters (26 feet). At a number of stations its elevation was approximately 17 meters (56 feet). At one station, Hughes, the elevation of the instrument was approximately 32 meters ( 105 feet). At a number of stations west of the Salina Base the telescope was used at the ordinary height of the eye. . · At the four stations, Iron Mound, North Pole Mound, Salina East Base, and Salina West Base, the observations were made by Assistant F. D. Granger in 1896, using theodolite No. 118 in s.eventeen positions, two series of observations being taken in each position, or thirty-four measures in all. The horizontal circle of this theodolite is 30°m in diameter, is graduated to 5 1 spaces, and is read directly to single seconds by three micrometer microscopes. The telescope has a clear aperture of 6°m, a focal length of 58°m, and a magnifying power of 35. The height of instrument above ground at these stations varied from 2 to 11 meters. At the stations westward from Bl.g Creek-Schmidt to the Colorado state line the observations were made by Assistant F. W. Perkins and W. B. Fairfield, observer, in 1891 and 1892. Assistant Perkins used Gambey repeating theodolite No. 16, having a horizontal circle 3o·m (12 inches) in diameter. The focal length of the telescope was 75°m (30 inches) and the clear aperture of the objective was 5.3°m (278 inches). The horizontal circle is· graduated to 5 1 and is read by two verniers to three seconds. The nu111bering of the graduation oi;i the horizontal circle increases from right to left. Mr. Fairfield used Gambey repeating theodolite No. 74, having a horizontal circle 25 cm ( 10 inches) in diameter, graduated from right to left and read by two verniers to five seconds. The focal length of the telescope was 38°m ( 15 inches) and the aperture of the objective 38mm ( 1 Yz inches)~ Each measurement of an angle consisted of six repetitions, three direct and three reversed, on the angle, these being followed immediately by three direct and three reversed on the explement in order to eliminate in part at least the effect of drag or overrun.in the clamp. Usually, three or four such measurements were made of each primary angle. The measurements of angles 011 the portion of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation north of the transcontinental triangulation to the Kansas-N.ebraska border were made in 1897-98 by Assistant F. D~ Granger, with theodolite No. 118, described above. During 1897, commencing at station Waldo and _ending at station Lebanon, the theodolite was used in eleven positions and two series of observations were taken in each position, or twenty-two measures in all, ai1d the instrument was less than 6 meters (20 feet) above the ground at each station. During the season of 1898, commencing with station Brow1~, the theodolite was used in thirteen positions, two series being taken in each position, or twenty-six measures in all. At the stations Brown and Cooper the instrument was about 2 l meters above the ground. On the triangulation southward from the thirty-ninth parallel the stations Bossing, Sherman, and Loder were occupied by Assistant William Eimbeck in 1899, using theodolite No. 145 in twenty-four positions, one measurement being made in each

position. Theodolite No. 145 carries a horizontal circle 3o"m ( 12 inches) in diameter graduated to 5' spaces and read directly by three micrometer microscopes to single seconds. The clear aperture of the telescope is 61mm (2.4. inches) and its focal length 74cm (29 inches). The stations on the southward extension of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation, commencing with the three stations, Iron Mound, Heath, and Wilson, on the southern border of the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation and extending southward to the stations Little River and Chase, were occupied by Assistant A. T. Mosman with theodolite No. 167 in 1900, with the exception of the three stations referred to in the preceding paragraph. In 1901, Assistant Mosman occupied the remaining stations southward to the Anthony base net, ending with Rutherford and the two ends of the base. Only eight positions, one-half the usual number, were observed, however, at Anthony Southeast Base. During the season of 1902, Assistants William Bowie and 0. W. Ferguson occupied the stations Anthony Southeast Base, Miller, and Fowler, using theodolites Nos. 167 and 168. Theodolites Nos. 167 and 168, used by Assistants Mosman, Bowie, and Ferguson, are similar to theodolite No. 145 described above. The approximate height at which the instrument was supported at each station is shown in the table under the heading, ''Programme of occupation of stations,'' which follows. It is important to note, however, that the superstructure which carried the heliotropes was much higher than the instrument in two cases, viz, at Arlington about 3 I. 4 n;ieters ( 104 feet), and at Kingman 36.6 meters (120 feet) while at each of these stations the instrument was less than 21 meters (69 feet) above the ground. Commencing with the season of 1900 only sixteen positions of the circle were used and one observation taken in each position. In 1900 the observations were made on both heliotropes and poles, and in 1901 mainly upon heli~tropes. In 1902 observations .were taken in the afternoon upon heliotropes and at night upon a\:etylene lights. Commencing with 1901 the observer took more chances, so to speak, of error by observing upon heliotropes of which the images appeared larger and more tremulous than were formerly considered safe to observe upon. The parties in 1901 also took similar chances. The exhibit of the accuracy of the work given later will indicate whether the accuracy of the observations is thereby appreciably ·reduced. During the seasons of 1900, 1901, and 1902 the observers were acting under the following instructions:
In making the measurements of horizontal directions, you will measure each direction in the primary scheme sixteen times, a direct and a reverse reading being considered one measurement, and sixteen positions of the circle are to he used, corresponding approximately to the following readings upon the initial signal:

\Vhen a broken series is observed the missing signals are to be observed later in connection with the chosen initial, or with some other one, and only one, of the stations already obsen·ed in that series. In selecting the com1itions under which to obsen·e, you should proceed upon the assumption that the maximum spee<l consistent with the requirement that the closing error of a t,rianglc in the primary scheme shall seldom exceed three seconds, and that the a\·erage closing error shall be but little greater than one second, is what is desired rather than a greater accuracy than that indicated.

In regard to the positions specified in these instructions, it is important to note three points: 1. In each of the four groups of four positions each, the readings of the three microscopes on the circle corresponding to pointings on the initial station will be nearly uniformly spaced at intervals of approximately 15° oyer the whole 360°, and therefore the mean values of the angles from each group of four positions will be but little affected by periodic errors of graduation. In connection with this statement it is necessary to keep in mind that, during each measure, the alidade is turned r8o 0 between the direct and reverse readings when the position of the telescope is changed, and therefore the three microscopes which are at intervals of 120° furnish readings at nearly uniform intervals of 60° during each measure. 2. In each group of four positions the micrometer readings corresponding to the initial station, and therefore those corresponding to each station, are nearly uniformly distributed over the 5' interval covered by the micrometer. The effect of this is to insure that if a correction for run is applied, the algebraic sum of such corrections for each micrometer corresponding to pointiHgs on each station ,\,ill be nearly zero. In other words, the mean value of any angle from observations in four positions uncorrected for run is almost independent of the run. An examination in detail of the observations at two or three stations showed that it was entirely unnecessary to apply any correction for run to observations made under these instructions, and considerable time was thereby saved in making the computation. 3. No microscope ever returns for pointings :on given station to any position on the circle which it has formerly occupied. \Vhen the observations in sixteen positions have been completed, the circle has been read at ninety-six points, scat.tered at intervals of three or four degrees over the whole circumference for each station obsen'ed. This insures that the mean value of each angle from sixteen positions is still more completely freecl from the effect of periodic errors than are the means from the separate groups of four positions each. T)le preceding statements apply to observations at the primary stations only. In determining points by intersections from primary stations, these points hf!ing for convenience called tertiary stations, the observations were usually taken in from one to three positions of the instn11nent, though there were occasionally wide ,·ariations from this standard.

In the following table the stations occupied on the southward extension of the ninetyeighth meridian triangulation are arranged in the order in which they were occupied. The second column indicates the days on which observations on primary stations were taken, the third column the number of such days, and the fourth column gives the approximate height of the instrument above the ground. In general, the pole, heliotrope, or light observed upon was but little, if any, higher than the instrument. The

two most extraordinary exceptions to this rule have already been mentioned, namely, at Arlington and Kingman. The average height of the signals must be considered in connection with the rate of progress of a triangulation, both because the work may be delayed in waiting for the building of signals, and because there is likely to be more delay 011 account of wind when observing from a high signal than when observing from a low one.

"From Salina Base to the stations Meades Ranch and \Valrlo.

The weather CO)lditions are not widely different in the various parts of the comparatively small area to which this summary refers, and comparison of the programmes of different seasons is therefore of special interest. The saving in time which has been made by reducing the number of observations is shown in part by the fact that for the 16 stations at which 34 observations were made the average number of observing days at each station was 10.5; for the 32 stations at which 24 obser"\'ations of each direction were made, 7.7 days; and for the 35 stations at which 16 observations were made, 4.5 days. This takes no account of the fact that the observer, while waiting for a day of additional observations to complete his programme, may be delayed by bad weather. It has already been shown* that the ratio of the number of observing days at station to the total number of days at the station, exclusive of the time before the first observation and after the last observation, was for the stations under consideration along the thirty-ninth parallel and to the northward o. 78, and that therefore every observing day saved was equivalent, upon an average, to a saving of one and one-fourth days for the party. The total number of days on which observations were made on the triangulation .to the southward in 1900, 1901, and 1902 was 9j, and the total number of days spent at the stations from the first to the last days of observation, inclusive, was 113, and the ratio o.86. On this work, then, either there must have been fewer bad days than on the work to the northward, or else the observer must have taken more apparent chances of error by observing on days which would by the observer on the northward triangulation have been condemned as unfit for observations. It is probable that the change of the ratio from 0.78 to o.86 was due in part to both causes. This ratio had remained o. 78, upon an average, for several years -----------·------

along the thirty-ninth parallel and on the ninety-eighth meridian to the northward. The same observer was at the instrument year after year. Everything being considered, it seems that the reduction in the number of observations from 34 to 16 has saved about 6 clays for the party at each station, and the reduction from 24 to 16 about 3 clays at each station. The question whether this large saving in time and cost has been accompanied by a decrease in the accuracy of the triangulation will be treated later. The season of triangulation in 1901 by Assistant A. T. Mosman was not only remark- . able for the small average number of clays of observation at each station (3.6) and for the small percentage of delay from bad \\'eather, but also for quick moves made between stations. Between June 10, when the first observations were taken at Savage, and September 21, when the last obsen'ations were taken at Anthony Northwest Base, an interval of 104 days, all the obsen·ations were taken at l 4 stations, and 1 3 moves were made from station to station. The average length of stay at each station, from the first observation to the last, was 4.0 days, and the average interval from the last primary observation at one station to the first at the next, including Sundays, delays on account of bad weather, packing up and unpacking, the move between stations, and the delays due to the failure of heliotropes to show at once, was 3. 7 days. The total time of the party per station, after observing had once commenced, was, therefore, upon an average 7. 7 days. This is, so far as the writer knows, the most rapid primary triangulation up to 1901. The best former season's record on this grade of triangulatim~ known to the writer was made by Assistant F. D. Granger in 1900 in Nebraska on the northward extension of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation. Eleven stations were occupied with an average interval from the first to the last primary observation at each station of 6. 3 clays, and an average interval between such obsen-ations of 7.2 days, or a total of 13.5 days per station. The longer time required on an average by Assistant Granger to move from station to station and prepare for observations was due in part to the fact that his signals were erected by the observing party, or men detailed from it, whereas in Assistant Mosman's work the sigmys were erected by a signalman and party operating almost independently of the observing party ..
STATE?IIENT OF ADJUST:llENTS.

For the stations involved in the triangulation along the thirty-ninth parallel, local adjustments were made. For the remaining stations, all in the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation, the computer made local adjustments at a few stations where the proportion of broken series was greatest, these being the cases in which the local adjustment will in genera' produce the greate:;t changes in the angles. These extraordinary cases being carefully studied indicated that the effect of the local adjustment at the remaining stations would in general be simply to change the a:igles in the hundredths of seconds, the tenths being seldom affected. It \\'as therefore considered that the time would not be \veil spent in making these local adjustments, the effects of which would be so small as to be entirely masked by the corrections inevitably applied in the figure adjustments. For the greater number of stations the directions used in the figure adjustments are therefore those· resulting directly from the observations after the mere taking of means. It should be noted that with the system of observations used since 1900, in which the missing signals

in a broken series are observed later in c:onnection with the chosen initial, or with some other one and only one of the signals already observed in that series, a local adjnstment will change the result very little, much less than when two or more of the signals already observed are included with the missing signal. The figure adjustments for the triangulation in Kansas were made in five sections: First, the Salina base net; second, from the Salina base net to the Versailles base net in Missouri; third, from the Salina base net to the El Paso base net in Colorado; fourth, from the line :Meades Ranch-Waldo, on the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation, to the Shelton base. net; fifth, from the lines Iron Mountain-Heath and Heath-\Vilson, on the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation, to the Anthony Base. Adjustments of the first three sections are published fully in Special Publication Ko. 4, The Transcontinental Triangulation. The adjustment of the fourth section is published in full in Appendix No. 6 of the Report for 1901, Triangulation Northward Along the Ninety-eighth Meridian. In the adjustment (see illustration No. 5) of the triangulation southward from the lines Iron Mountain-Heath and Heath-Wilson of the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation, which had previously been fixed in length and direction, to the Anthony Base, which is fixed in length* by the base measures, there are 1 21 directions connected by 50 rigid conditions, as indicated below, of which 35 refer to closures of triangles, 14 to ratios of sides, and the last condition is that the length of the Anthony Base, as carried from the line Wilson-Heath, must agree with its measured length. The length of the Anthony Base, as reduced to sea level, is 6 034. 7048 meters (logarithm 3. 7806560). This corresponds exactly to the published length of the base in Appendix 3 of 1901. The reduction to sea level as there printed was computed upon the supposition that the elevation of the bench mark at Anthony Southeast Base "·as 419.9346 meters. The best elevation now available for this bench mark is 419.9081 meters. This change in the assigned elevation is so small as not to affect the reduction to the sea level by as much as a tenth of a millimeter. It is important to note that the length equation extends to the base itself instead of stopping ~t the border line of the base net, as had been the practice of this Snn-ey up to 1901. In the following condition equations the numbers assigned to the directions correspond to those shown in illustration No. 5. The number of a direction inclosed in parenthesis, thus ( r), means the required correction to that direction.

As measured by this standard the southward triangulation under consideration is intermediate in accuracy between the triangulation northward on the ninety-eighth meridian and the triangulation along the thirty-ninth parallel in 11issouri, Kansas and Colorado. For a comparison covering a large part of the United States and necessarily involving varied conditions as to climate, topography and length of line, it may he noted that in the 2 1 sections* into which the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation was divided the maximum value of d was ±011 .82 in the American Bottom base uet; the minimum value was ±o". 23 in the Nevada-California series of triangles; and the average value was ±o".44. On but 8 of the 21 sections was d less than ±o".35, its value on the triangulation southward along the ninety-eighth meridian. On the 19 sections -f into which the triangulation along Eastern Oblique Arc was divided the maximum value of d was ±o". 79 in the first section west of the Atlanta Base in Georgia and Alabama; its minimum value was ±o".26, occurring on two sections, one in Kew England and the other at Dauphin Island base net. The a\·erage value of d for this whole arc was ±o".51 and on but 4 sections out of 19 was it less than ±o".35. By inspection of the formula for the probable error, d, of an obsetTed direction gi,·en above, it may be seen that if the ratio of the number of directions to the number of conditions is the same in two groups of adjusted triangles, the values of d 2 are proportional to the average values of v 2 · Under these conditions, then, the average value of the correction to a direction may be used as a rough means of comparing the accuracy of any one group or part of a group with some other group, since the probable error of an observed direction will be nearly proportional to the average value of corrections to directions in such groups. The values of the ratio of the number of directions divided by the number of conditions in the five groups of adjusted triangles westward from the Salina Base to the El Paso base net and northward to the Page Base varied from 2.2 to 2.6. It is 2.4 in the first adjusted group of triangles southward from the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation, which is now under consideration. Hence, the mean value of the correction to a direction may be used throughout these groups as an approximate measure of the relative accuracy of different parts of the triangulation. It is especially desirable to determine whether the accuracy has been affected appreciably by the reduction in the number of observations of each direction, accompanied as it is by a considerable reduction in the number of days on which observations were taken.

For the whole group of triangles from the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation southward to the Anthony Base, involving obser\'ations from 1899 to 1902, the total number of directions is 12 1, the average correction to a direction o" .26, and the maximum correction 1".39. The evidence here sho\yn indicates that the great increase in rapidity of the triangulation has not been accompanied Ly any reduction in -accuracy.
ACCt:RACY AS INDICATED B\' CORRECTIONS- 'l'O ANGLES AND CLOSURHS OF TRIANGLES.

The correction to each angle is the algebraic difference of the corrections to two directions. In order to make it possible t_o study the corrections to separate angles, they are shown in the following table for every triangle in the primary scheme from the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation southward to the Anthony Base, together with the closure of the triangles, the corrected spherical angles, and the spherical excess. The plus sign prefixed to the error of closure of the triangle indicates that the smn of the angles is less than 180° plus the spherical excess. The spherical excess is a convenient indication of the size of the triangulation, since it is proportional to the area.

The maximum correction to any angle is - l ".96, to the angle at Rutherfor9., between Anthony Southeast Base and Fowler, measured in 1901. The triangulation shows 14 closing errors of the plus sign and 28 of the minus sign. The average closing error for this triangulation without regard to sign is o".79 (42 triangles). For a comparison it may be noted that the average closing error for the whole transcontinental triangulation is 1 ".06, and that the average closing error for the 2 i sections into which that triangulation was divided varies from a minimum of o". 57 in the Nevada-California section to a maximum of 2 11 · 22 in the American Bottom base net (see "The Transcontinental Triangulation," p. 613).

As measured by this standard the southward triangulation under consideration is intermediate in accuracy between the triangulatioi1 northward from the thirty-ninth parallel and the triangulation along the thirty-ninth parallel° in Missouri, Kansas and Colorado. For a comparison covering a .large part of the United States, and necessarily involving varied conditions as to climate, topography, and length of line, it may be noted that in the 2 r sections into which the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation was divided t the maximum value· for the mean error of an angle was ±1".59 in the American Bottom base net; the minimum value was ±o" -42 in the Nevada-California series of triangles; and the average value was ±o". 77. There are but two sections out of 21 for ~vhich it is less than ±011 .54. Similarly, in the 19 sections into which the triangulation along the Eastern Oblique Arc is divided t the maximum value of the mean error of an angle was ± 111 .31, in Virginia and North Carolina; its minimum value was ±o".49, in the Fire Island base net; and its mean value ±o".82. There are but 3 sections out of 19 for which it is less than ±o".54. The mean error of an angle as thus computed from the triangle closures may be rendered comparable with the probable error of an observed direction by multiplying it b·y ./ ~, to take account of the fact that an angle is the difference of two directions, and by the factor 0.674 to reduce from a mean error to a probable error. The mean error of an angle, a, for the triangulation now under consideration, from the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation to the Anthony Base, viz, ±o".54, when reduced to the probable error of an observed direction, d, is ±o". 26, whereas the probable error of an observed direction derived from the figure adjustment is ±011 .35. The excess of the second of these values over the first is an indication of the magnitude of the errors which were put in evidence by the rigid conditions relating to the ratios of the sides and the accord in length between bases and which do not appear from the triangle closures .alone. To secure still further evidence as to whether the accuracy of the triangulation has been appreciably affected by the reduction of the number of observations and the

This evidence indicates that an increase in accuracy rather than a decrease has accompanied the increase in the rapidity of the triangulation. No attempt has been made here to set forth the agreement of the separate measures of each direction as a criterion of accuracy, since it is well known that it is of little value for that purpose. A close agreement of the separate measures of a given direction is of little consequence, since such measures are usually subject to constant errors of considerable size which become evident as soon as the closures of the triangles are studied or an attempt is made to adjust the figure.

There are five bases which serve to fix the lengths of triangulation lines in Kansas, namely, the Salina Base in central Kansas, Versailles Base in Missouri, El Paso Base in Colorado, Shelton Base in Nebraska, and Anthony Base in southern Kansas. The accord in length between each of these bases as measured and its value as computed from the triangulation through the adjacent triangles furnishes a valuable test of the accuracy of the triang.ulation. In solving the normal equations of the figure adjustment between the Salina base net and the Versailles base net the length equation was, as usual, assigned to the last place, so that the discrepancy in length, after all the conditions relating to closures of triangles and ratios of length had been satisfied, became known. It thus became evident that the Versailles Base as computed from the Salina Base was one part in 25 700 shorter than its measured length (represented by 169 the seventh place of logarithms). Similarly the El Paso Base as computed from the Salina Base was found t.o be one part in 47 ooo shorter than its measured length (represented by 92.3 in the seventh place of logarithms). So also, the Shelton Base. as computed from the line Meades Ranch-Waldo, a line intermediate between the Salina and El Paso bases of the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation, was found to be shorter by one part in 58 ooo than its measured length (represented by 75 in the seventh place of logarithms).

Anthony Base, computed from the line Wilson-Heath of the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation in the vicinity of the Salina Base, was found to be one part in 107 ooo less than its measured length (or 41 units in the seventh place of logarithms). In view of the fact that the triangulation southward .to the Anthony Base was done very rapidly and economically, it is important to note that the discrepancy developed on the Anthony Base is smaller than the other three similar discrepancies quoted above for triangulation under the same conditions as to climate, topography and length of line. It is also important to note that of the nine similar discrepancies developed on the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation there are but three "'.hich are smaller than this discrepancy between the Anthony and Salina bases, namely, between the Olney and American Bottom bases, Kent Island and St. Albans bases, and St. Albans and Holton bases.*
ACCURACY AND ECONOMY.

In fixing the methods of triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian an aim has constantly been to hold the accuracy up to the standard fixed by the best half of the transcontinental triangulation and the triangulation along the Easte. n Oblique Arc, a standard of accuracy which compares very favorably with that actually attained in any country. With equal constancy there has been kept in view the desirability of reducing the cost of the triangulation and the time required for it as much· as possible, while holding the accuracy up to this high standard. '!'he success attained in increasing the speed of the triangulation is measured roughly by the fact that the average number of observing days at a station has been reduced since 1896 to much less than one-half t11e former number, and the speed of the triangulation, including all delays for moving, etc., has been fully doubled. '!'his increase in speed has been accompanied by a corresponding reduction in cost. '!'he cost of building signals, provided they are built by the observing party, is not influenced appreciably by the rate at which the triangulation is done. '!'he remaining expenses of the party are roughly proportional to the time spent in the field for a party of given size, and therefore any increase in speed is accompanied by a nearly proportional decrease· in cost per station. In the later years heliotropes have been used rather than poles, and this has tended to increase the cost per station. After all the elements of cost are taken into account it inust be conceded that there has been a very large reduction in the cost per station since 1896. '!'hat the accuracy has been kept up to the selected standard is put in evidence in detail in the foregoing pages by the corrections 'to directions, closures of triangles, and accord between bases. '!'he detailed compari::;ons which have been given show that the gradual change of methods has certainly not been accompanied by any decrease in accuracy. 'I'he comparisons given on the preceding pages show that the accuracy of the latest section of the triangulation, namely, from the thirty-ninth parallel southward to the Anthony Base, is such as to place it about the middle of the first third of the triangulation along the thirty-ninth parallel and the Eastern Oblique Arc, if the various ·sections of triangulation are placed in order of accuracy.

EXPLA:N'ATION OF POSITIONS, LENGTHS, AND AZIMUTHS, A:"D OF THE UNITED STATES STANDARD DATUM.

The lengths, as already fully explained in connection with the adjustments, all depend upon the Shelton, Salina, Versailles, Anthony, and El Paso bases. The positions-that is, the latitudes, longitudes, and the azimuths-need a special explanation. All of the positions and azimuths have been computed upon the Clarke spheroid of 1866, which has been in use in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for many years. After a spheroid has been adopted and all the angles and lengths in a triangulation have been fully fixed, it is still necessary, before the computation of latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths can be made, to adopt a standard latitude and longitude for a specified station and a standard azimuth of a line from that station. For convenience let the adopted standard position (latitude and longitude) of a given station, together with the adopted standard azimuth of a line from that station, be called the geodetic datum. The primary triangulation in the United States was commenced at various points, and existed at first as a number of detached portions iu each of which the geodetic datum was necessarily dependent only upon the astronomic stations connected with that particular portion. As examples of such detached portions of triangulation there may be mentioned the early triangulation in New England and along the Atlantic coast, a detached portion of the transcontinental triangulation centering on St. Louis and another portion of the same triang-ulation in the Rocky Mountain region, and three separate portions of triangulation in California in the latitude of San Francisco, in the vicinity of Santa Barbara Channel, and in the vicinity of San Diego. \Vith the lapse of time these separate pieces have expanded until they have touched or overlapped. The transcontinental triangulation, of which the office computation was completed in l 899, joins all of the detached portions mentioned and makes them one continuous triangulation. As soon as this took place the logical necessity existed of discarding the old geodetic data used in these various pieces and substituting one datum for the whole country, or at least for as much of the country as is covered by continuous triangulation. To do this is a very heavy piece of work, and involved much preliminary study to determine the best datum to be adopted. On March 13, l 901, the Superintendent adopted what is now known as the United States Standard Datum, and it was decided to reduce the positions to that datum as rapidly as possible. The datum adopted was that formerly in use in New England, and therefore its adoption will not affect the positions which have been used for geographic purposes in New England* and along the Atlantic coast to North Carolina, or those in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. The adopted datum does not agree, however, with that used in ''The Transcontinental Triangulation'' and in ''The Eastern Oblique Arc of the United States," publications which deal primarily with the purely scientific problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. As the adoption of such a standard datum is a matter of considerable importance, it is in order here to explain the desirability of this step more fully.
*Many such positions are published in Appendix No. 8, Report for 1885, Appendix N_o. 8, for 1888, and Appendix No. IO, for :894.

The main objects to be attained by the geodetic operations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey are, first, the control of the charts published by the Survey; second, the furnishing of geographic positions (latitudes and loni:;itudes), of accurately determined elevations, and of distances and azimuths to engineers connected with the Coast and Geodetic Survey and to other organizations; third, the detern1ination of the figure of the earth. The first two of these objects are purely practical; the third is purely scientific. For the first and second objects it is not necessary that the reference spheroid should be accurately that which most closely fits the geoid within the area CO\'ered, nor that the adopted geodetic datum should be absolutely the best that can be derived from the astronomic observations at hand. It· is simply desirable that the reference spheroid and the geodetic datum adopted shall be, if possible, such a close approximation to the truth that any correction which may hereafter be derived from the observations which are now or may become available shall not greatly exceed the probable errors of 'such corrections. It is, however, very desirable that one spheroid and one geodetic datum be used for the whole country. In fact, this is absolutely necessary if a geodetic survey is to perform fully the function of accurately coordinating all surveys within the area which it covers. This is the most important function of a geodetic imrvey. To perform this function it is also highly desirable .that when a certain spheroid and geodetic datum have been adopted for a country they should be rigidly adhered to without change for all time, unless shown to be largely in error. In striving to attain the third object, the determination of the figure of the earth, the conditions are decidedly different. This problem concerns itself primarily with astronomic observations of latitude, longitude and azimuth, and with the geodetic positions of the points at which the astronomic obsen·ations were made, but is not concerned with the geodetic positions of other points fixed by the triangulations. The geodetic positions (latitudes and longitudes) of comparatively few points are therefore concerned in this problem. However, in marked contrast to the statements made in preceding paragraphs, it is desirable in dealing with this problem that, with each new important accession of data, a new spheroid fitting the geoid with the greatest possible accnracy, and new values of the geodetic latitudes, longitudes and azimuths of the highest degree of accuracy, should be derived. The United States Standard Datum was adopted with reference to positions furnished for geographic purposes, but has no reference to the problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. It is adopted with reference to the engineer's problem of fnrnishing standard positions, and does not affect the scientist's problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. The principles which guided in the selection of the datum to be adopted were: First, the adopted datum should not differ widely from the ideal datum for which the sum of the station errors in latitude, longitude, and azimuth should each be zero; second, it was desirable that the adopted datum should produce mini111um changes in the publications of the Survey, including its charts; and third, it was desirable, other things beit1g equal, to adopt that datum which allowed the maximum nu111ber ·of positions already in the office registers to remain unchanged, and therefore necessitated a minimum amount of new computation. These considerations led to the adoption as the United States Standard of the datum which had been in use for many years in the northeastern group of States and along the Atlantic coast as far as North Carolina.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1902.

An examination of the approximate station errors available on the United States Standard Datum at 204 latitude stations, 68 longitude stations, and 126 azimuth stations, scattered widely over the United States from Maine to Louisiana and to California, indicated that this datum approaches closely the ideal with which the algebraic sum of the station errors of each class would be zero. How closely it approaches that ideal will be set forth in a later publication. The adopted United States Standard Datum, upon which the positions and azimuths given in this publication depend, may be defined in terms of the position of tl-e station Meades Ranch, as follows:
0 "

=39 13 26.686 A. 98 32 30.506 a to Waldo=75 28 14.52
<p

The positions here published on the United States Standard Datum therefore differ considerably from those gi\·en in ''The Transcontinental Triangulation'' (pp. 854-865), which depend upon a special geodetic datum which was adopted for the special purpose of that publication, and which was based upon the astronomic observations comiected with that triangulation alone. The position given for the station Meades Ranch, in "The Transcontinental Triangulation '' (p. 862), is0 "

=;:39 13 25.006 A. =98 32 30.469. a to Waldo=75 28 16.52

The corrections to reduce this position to the United States Standard Datum areII

Ll<p=+ 1.680 L1 A.=+0.037 Lla=-2.00

Such corrections to reduce a position from one datum to another are not constant, but vary slightly from station to station.

TABI,B OP POSITIONS, AZIJ\ICTHS, AND LBNGTIIS.

The following tables_give the positions of all points, and the azimuths and lengths of all lines, fixed by Coast and Geodetic Survey triangulation in Kansas. ·These tables may be conveniently consulted by using as finders the five sketches at the end of this appendix and the preceding index. In the third column of the index will be found for each point, a reference to the page on which its description is given, and in the fourth column the page on which its elevation above sea level may be found. · The azimuth and length of every line over which observations have been made in one or both directions are given in the list in connection with the position of one end only of the line. The positions of all points for which the latitudes and longitudes are given to thousandths of seconds have been fixed by a complete adjustment of the triangulation concerned, so as to make all the triangles close and remove all discrepancies between lengths, azimuths, and positions. Such adjustments are of a very high degree of accuracy, as indicated in the preceding pages, for points on the primary scheme, of a less degree of accuracy for secondary points, and of a still more approximate character for tertiary points determined by intersections only.· In each class all discrepancies are removed to the limit given by the decimal place shown. The statements in regard to the various degrees of accuracy refer to the manner in which the discrepancies were removed.

COAST AND GEODETIC SGR VEY REPORT, 1902.

If less than three decimal places are given in the latitudes and longitudes the point in question has not been fixed by fully adjusted triangulation, or is fixed in such a way as to furnish no check on its position; and the accuracy with which its position is known is indicated in part by the number of decimal places given. The seconds in meters are given for the convenience of draftsmen. In the column giving azimuths, distances, and logarithms of distances various numbers of deci1iial places are given, the intention being to indicate the accuracy to a certain extent, it being understood that in each quantity two doubtful figures are given. In some cases there is very little doubt of the correctness of the second figure from the right, and in a few cases some doubt may be cast upon the third figure. . · The following tables give the positions of 94 primary stations and 176 subordinate stations, or 270 in all. Of these 23 primary and 45 subordinate stations are reprinted from Appendix 6 of 1901. The number of new stations is, therefore, 202, of which 7 I are primary stations and 131 subordinate stations.

DESCRIPTIONS OF STA'l'IONS.

This list may be conveniently consulted by reference to the illustrations at the end of this apr-endix and the index on pages 238-242. In each description the tense used is appropriate to the date at which the description was written. All directions in the descriptions are given in the form of azimutJ1s reckoned continuously from south around by west to 360°, west being 90°, north r 80°, and east 270°. The azimuths are true, not magnetic. In general, the surface and underground marks described are not in contact, so that a disturbance of the surface mark will not, in general, affect the underground mark. The underground mark should be resorted to only when there is evidence that the surface mark has been disturbed.

GENERAL STATEllIENT IN REGARD TO THE DETERMINATION OF ELEVATIONS,SOUTHWARD ALONG THE. NINETY-EIGHTH MERIDIAN.

While the measurement of horizontal angles was in progress at each station, the vertical angles to each station of the primary scheme were also measured on as many days as possible. Vertical measures were also made on secondary and tertiary stations. The observations in the primary scheme were reciprocal but not simultaneous-i. e., each line was observed in both directions but in general at different times. Vertical measures were as a rule made during the middle part of the day when the refraction is near its minimum value and when its diurnal change is slow. The most notable exceptions are that during the season of r899, at Bossing, Sherman, and Loder a considerable number of observations were made during the early and late hours of the day, and at stations Miller, Fowler, and Anthony Southeast Base the observations were made between 3 and 4 p. m., and also at night. The night observations were not used in the computation. Along the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation to the northward and on some parts of the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation in Kansas, the zenith distances of but few of .the primary stations visible from a given station were observed directly with a

282

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1902.

vertical circle. The vertical angles to the other visible stations were determined by measuring the differences of zenith distances between these stations and the two or more at which absolute measures had been made. For this purpose an eyepiece micrometer on the telescope of the theodolite used in measuring horizontal angles was employed. On the other hand, all the vertical angles were measured directly with a vertical circle at stations southward along the ninety-eighth meridian. At stations on the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation to the westward of Big Creek and Schmidt, no elevations were determined by means of vertical angles. It is useless to aim at a high degree of accuracy in such vertical measures over lines from IO to 30 miles long or longer, since the irregular variation of the refraction from hour to hour and day to day produces changes in vertical angles which affect the tens of seconds, and sometimes even the minutes. All differences of elevation computed from such observat~ons are subject to large errors, due to these atmospheric changes, regardless of the degree of refinement of the instrumental measures. The accuracy of the elevations determined along the ninety-eighth meridian would probably have been increased somewhat by extending the observations at eacb station over many days, but such slight increase in accuracy would not have justified the extra expenditure of time and money. The accuracy of the elevations has been kept within such limits as to make them valuable for topographic and cartographic purposes by frequent connection of the measures with bench marks of which the elevations have been accurately determined by precise leveling forming a part of the level net covering the eastern half of the United States. The computation, with the adjustment, of the elevations determined by vertical angles from the Salina Base westward and northward to the Shelton Base has already been published in detail.* The adjustment eastward from the Salina Base to the Missouri State line has been made in a similar manner. The computation of elevations from the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation southward to the Anthony Base is stated.fully below.
COMPUTATION, ADJUSTMENT, AND ACCURACY OF THE ELEVATIONS NINETY-EIGHTH MERIDIAN SOUTHWARD. ALONG THE

The zenith distances directly observed at each station were first computed and were corrected for height of object observed and of instrument so as to refer them all to the station marks. The difference of elevation of each pair of stations in the main scheme was then computed from the observations over the line joining them by the formula

existed between the observed differences of elevation, even if the connections with the precise leveling were ignored, and the least square adjustment furnishes the readiest accurate means of deriving the required ~levations. The elevations from the stations Iron Mound, Heath, and Wilson, of the thirtyninth parallel triangulation, southward to and including the Anthony Base were all adjusted in one set of equations. In the follo\ving tabulation the observed differences of elevfltion are shown, together with their adjusted values. The weight p assigned to each observed difference of elevation is inversely proportional to the length s of the line between stations in meters and was conveniently computed by the fonnula, log p~9-2 log s. The observed difference of ·elevation is given the sign of the elevatio·n of the second station named minus the elevation of the first. The quantity contained in the last column but one is the correction to be applied to an observed difference of elevation to obtain the adjusted difference of elevation.

In the adjustment of which the direct results are indicated above, the elevations of the stations Iron Mound, Heath, and Wilson were considered fixed at the values 456.65, 553.87, 567.64 meters, respectively, which are the elevations derived for them in the adjustment set forth on pages 417-419, 422 of Appendix 6, Report for 1901, corrected by +4cm to take account of the effect of new leveling recently introduced into the precise level net. Certain other elevations were fixed by precise leveling as follows: Pretty Prairie, 487.74 meters; Kingman, 509.09 meters; Anthony Southeast Base, 419.91 meters, and Anthony Northwest Base, 425.62 meters. The elevations of the 19 remaining stations connected by the observations are the elevations to be detennined by least squares from the 53 observed differences of elevation indicated above. The observations over the line Sunflower-Pretty Prairie were rejected. The discrepancy developed on this line was 5. 7 meters, and the coefficient of refraction computed from the observations was abnormal. The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from the adjustment is ±0.91 meter. In other words,· the reciprocal observations over a line 31.7 kilometers (197'§ miles) long, this being the length of the line corresponding to unit weight, determined the elevation of two points with such a degree of accuracy that it is an even chance whether the error is greater or less than 0.91 meter. The probable errors of lines for other lengths were assumed to be proportional to their lengths. The probable errors of the elevations of the four stations fixed by precise leveling are about ±0.06 meter. The probable error approaches this value for stations adjacent to those fixed by precise leveling and is greatest for the most remote stations. Station Chase was assumed to be the on1e least accurately determined, and its probable error was therefore computed as a limiting value and was found to be ±o. 72 meter from the vertical angle measures alone, or, when combined with the probable error of the elevations fixed by the precise leveling, it was still ±o. 72.

APPENDIX NO. 3.

TRIANGULATIO.N' IN KANSAS.

In other words, for the least accurately determined station in tl:c main scheme between the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation and the Anthony Base there is an even chance that the elevation is correct within o. 7 meter, or 2.3 feet, and for most stations in the main scheme the accuracy is much greater than this.
TABLR OF ELEVATIONS.

The datum for all the elevations is mean sea level. The stations are in three classes: First, those fixed directly by the precise leveling, and of which the elevation is subject to a probable error of ±0.06 meter; second, the primary stations fixed by reciprocal measures of vertical angles and which are subject to probable errors varying from ±o. 1 to ±o. 7 meter; third, the tertiary stations of which the elevations are fixed by measurements of vertical angles which are not reciprocal, the tertiary stations not being occupied. These elevations are subject to probable errors which may be as great as ±2 meters in some cases. For more exact elevations of the stations fixed by the precise leveling and for an exact description of the point on each station mark to which such elevations are referred, the published results of precise leveling should be consulted. The accuracy with which each elevation in the main scheme is determined depends mainly upon the remoteness of that station from the nearest one of which the elevation is fixed by precise leveling as indicated in class 1 of the following table. As already noted, station Chase is probably least accurately determined of the stations to the southward of the thirty-ninth parallel tringulation, its probable error being ±o. 7 meter. Of the stations to the northward Brown is supposed to be the least accurately determined, having a probable error of ±0.3 meter.

COAST A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1902. DESCRIPTION.

It is constructed of aluminum and consists of two concentric disks C C and D D, the inner one revolving about a spindle fixed in the center of the outer one. The outer disk C C has a logarithmic scale of numbers (circle No. 5) engraved on its beveled upper surface. The principal graduations on this scale correspond to t!1e logarithmic value of the numbers from I to 100, with intermediate graduations corresponding to 102, ro4,

106, etc., increasing by single unit intervals up to 20, and then 205, 215, 225, etc., increasing by intervals of 5 up to 50. These intermediate graduations, as well as the intermediate ones on the other scales to be described are not shown on the drawing. The inner disk D D has four concentric logarithmic scales engraved upon its upper surface, representing the values of the quantities 3.2809 X tan n (3.2809 being' the ratio of the meter to the foot, and n the yertical angle) for angles from 2' up to 30°.

APPENDIX NO. 4.

THE HYPSOGRAPH.

299

The inner one of the four (No. I) is graduated for angles from 2 1 to ro', inclusive; the next (No. 2) from· II 1 to I 0 441 ; the next (No. 4) from I7° to 30°, and the outer circle· (No. 3) from 1 ° 45' to 16 ° 3o'. They are placed in this order so as to bring the one most frequently used next to the number scale. To the left of the index line, on a part of the circle of scale No. 4, is another scale representing the logarithmic values of cos· n for reducing rod readings to horizontal distance when the rod is held above or below the plane of the observer's instrument. Referring to the drawing, E Eis a milled head for revolving the inner disk; F F is a reading arm, its fiducial edge serving as a guide line for reading the graduation marks on the outer circle (on C C) correspondipg to a given angle on either of the inner circles; G is a screw that holds the two disks together; a s~iral spring in the open space around the shank of this screw keeps the two disks in contact by its constant pressure; H H are two screws that secure the milled head E E to the disk D D; K is a clamping screw that works against a cylindrical lug L, which in turn presses against the circumference of the disk D D and holds it securely clamped. The lug is introduced between the screw and disk so that there may be no tendency to rotate the disk when the clamp screw is set.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
To FIND THJt DIFFERENCE IN HEIGHT, CORRESPONDING TO A GIVEN DISTANCR IN METERS AND
ANGLE OF Er.itvATION OR DEPRESSION.

Unclamp the instrument by loosening the small brass screw. Turn the inner disc until the index line coincides with the given distance, in meters, on the outermost circle. · Clamp the instrument. Swing the reading arm around to the right, clockwise, till its fiducial edge coincides with the graduation mark of the given angle. Then, on the outermost circle, at the fiducial edge of the reading arm, read the scale for the numbers composing the integer and decimal of the required difference of height i!l feet.
To
LOCATE THE DECIMAL POINT IN THE RESULT.

FRO:li THE INDEX LINE TO THE ORIGIN OF THE OUTER SCALE.

On the reading arm will be seen the numbers - 1 , o, - 2 , and -3. These numbers show how many figures of the scale reading are to be pointed off for the decimal. Thus, if the index line be set at distance 300, and the given angle is 3°, there will be seen on the reading arm over the circle on which the 3° is located, the number - I . This indic.ates that there will be one figure of the scale reading pointed off for the decimal. Hence the required ditference of height is 5i.6 feet. Similarly, if the given distance is .still 300 meters but the angle 30°, the required difference of height is 568 feet. The number o on the reading arm, over the circle on which 30° is lo.cated, indicates that the whole number of figures of the scale reading is to be taken for the required difference of height. In like manner if the distance is still 300 meters but the angle 2o', the difference of height is 5. 73 feet; and for 300 meters and 2 1 it is 0.573 foot.

WHEN THI-: READING ARM PASSES BJ'\"OND THE ORIGIN OF THH OUTER SCAr,i-:.

If, however, the rea<ling arm, in swinging around to the right, clockwise, from the index line to the given angle, passes the starting point, I, ef t(ze outermost scale, then the numbers on the reading arm must each be increased by unity, and instead of - I , o, - 2 , and -3, they become o, r, - 1 , and - 2 , and the number of figures in the integer is increased accordingly.

+

RBDUCTTON OF ROD READINGS ON INCLINED SIGHTS TO HORIZON.TAI. PI.ANH OF OBSERVER.

Set the index line on the graduation mark on the outermost scale corresponding to the reading of the-inclined sight, and then swing the reading arm to the left, traversing the graduation on circle No. 4 marked cos ·n, until its fiducial edge coincides with the given angle of inclination. Then, on the outermost circle, read the graduation under the edge of the reading arm for the required horizontal distance. Thus, for an inclined distance of 300 meters and an angle of 20° the horizontal distance is 265 meters. For distances greater than 1 ooo meters a correction for curvature and refraction must be applied.
MEMORANDA.

The large center milled head is not a clamp, but a handle for turning the inner disc ·and index line to any desired position. The clamp is the small milled-head brass screw on the outer edge of the instrument. The graduation on the beveled portion of the instrument refers to distances and heights. To move the index line after the instrument is clamped use the projecting finger hold at the base of the arm. Be careful not to attempt to move the inner circle before the instrumeut is undamped.

I. SELECTION OF SITES OF THE MAGNETIC OBSERVATORIES.

The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey has in operation, in conformity with the plan of the magnetic s·urvey of the United States and countries under its jurisdiction, outlined in Appendix 10, Report of the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1899~ four h1agnetic observatories at 'vhich the manifold variations of the Earth's magnetism are being continuously recorded by photographic means. These continuous records, bes.ides serving other useful purposes, are utilized in referring the values of the magnetic elements, obtained at various stations and ~t various times by the field parties engaged in the magnetic survey, to a common time. These four magnetic observatories, which constitute at present the primary magnetic base stations of the magnetic survey of the United States and countries under its jurisdiction, are as follows : 1. Tile Clzeltenllam Magnetic Observatory, situated at Cheltenham, Md., 14 miles, or 22 ~ kilometers, in an air line, southeast from the United States Capitol at Washington City. This is the principal or standard magnetic observatory, where, in addition to the regular observatory work, all magnetic instruments are standardized; 2. Tile St'tka Magnetic Observatory, located at Sitka, Alaska, near the new Russian Cemetery. The magnetic and meteorological observatory, which the Russians had iii operation between 1842 and 1867, was situated on Japonski Island, in Sitka Harbor, about three-eighths of a mile, or three-fifths of a kilometer, west of the present site; 3. Tile Honolulu Magnett'c Observatory, located on an immense coral plain 12 ~ miles, or 20 kilometers, in an air line, west of the city of Honolulu, Hawaii; 4. Tile Baldwin Magnetic Observatory, situated at Baldwin, Kans., 13 miles, or 21 kilometers, in an air line, south of Lawrence, Kans. This observatory is a temporary one, and the magnetograph was mounted in an existing structure. The site for a more permanent observatory in the Western States has not yet been chosen. In addition to the above, the Survey is contemplating, in the near future, the erection of a magnetic observatory in Porto Rico,* a region recommended as a desirable one for a magnetic observatory by the International Magnetic Conference held at Bristol, England, in 1898, and one which the recent volcanic eruptions in Martinique and concomitant magnetic storms have made doubly interesting and important for magnetic investigation. As soon as the magnetic survey of the extreme Western States is undertaken, the establishment of a magnetic observatory in that region will be imperative.
*A set of self-registering instruments (declination and horizontal intensity) was mounted temporarily in Fort Isabel, Vieques Island, east of Porto Rico, and put in operation in February, 1903.

COAST AND GEODETIC SL'R VEY REPORT,

1902.

The selection of a suitable site for a magnetic observatory to be continuously and uninterruptedly in operation for a period of fifteen years, at least, is a most difficult matter in view of the rapid spread and development of electric car lines and electric power and lighting establishments. Nearly every prominent magnetic observatory over the entire globe has suffered more or less in recent years from stray industrial electric currents. Thus the two principal observatories in England, Kew and Greenwich, in oper&tion for a half a century and more, 1iave been affected by the London electric car lines. Kew is at present making preparations to move to a new site. Nearly every magnetic observatory in France has suffered, and its principal observatory has been moved from Pare Saint Maur to Val Joyeux. The Belgians and the Austrians have likewise been obliged to select new sites for their principal magnetic observatories, and the Dutch are now making preparations to resume work at their new magnetic observatory in Java, their former observatory at Batavia, so long in succe~ful operation, having had its work vitiated by the Batavia electric car lines. By the decree of the Emperor, forbidding a closer approach of electric car lines than I 6 kilometers, the Germans have been able to keep their principal observatory at Potsdam free from disturbance. Considerable pressure has been exerted, however, on the part of the inhabitants in the district where electric car lines are excluded for better rapi,d-transit facilities than now existing, and there has already been some talk of placing the observatory in a more isolated site. The New Zealand observatory recently started at Christchurch is in danger of having its work interrupted by contemplated electric car lines. The disastrous effects from uninsulated electric car systems were first experienced in the United States, in 1892, at the Coast and Geodetic Survey magnetic observatory situated at San Antonio, Tex. When the facts were made known to prominent magneticians; some of them would not admit that the disturbances were due to stray currents from the San Antonio electric car line. To-day there is no longer any question that effects from such sources may be obtained 5 miles distant from the car lines. It was necessary to move the observatory at San Antonio to a new site, where it continued its wor~ uninterruptedly until 1895, when the work was closed. Since then the Canadians have been obliged to move the famous Toronto Magnetic Observatory, which had been in operation for nearly six decades. The United States Naval Observatory, which undertook to maintain a magnetic observatory within the limits of a large city was obliged to close its magnetic work entirely, and the Mexicans, immediat~ly after the installation of the instruments in a newly erected observatory, were compelled to abandon the work because of the effects from the electric car lines extended from the City of Mexico. Having these experiences in mind, special care was taken in the selection of the sites for the new magnetic observatories of the Coast and Geodetic Suryey. The idea was abandoned altogether that it would be possible to maintain an observatory for several years in any locality already well settled or possessing inducements for settlement in the near future. The next point of prime consideration is the uniformity in the distribution of magnetism within the area to be occupied for the various kinds. of work at a magnetic observatory, so as to avoid the necessity of a reduction of the magnetic elements to a normal station, and thereby to eliminate the necessity of controlling the constancy of the r~duction-following a rule that pertains especially to magnetic work, viz, to ayoid, ab initio, any cause for correction. Further points to be considered apply to accessibility of the station, to freedom from

APPENDIX NO. 5.

other disturbing influences than those from electrical sources, to facilities obtainable in . the locality for carrying out the observatory work, such as supplies and abundance of pure water for the photographic work, comfort and convenience of observers, mail and telegraphic commtmications, etc. If other than magnetic work is to be carried on, such as investigations in atmospheric and telluric electricity, seismology, and meteorology, full consideration must likewise be given to the demands of these special branches. The sites for the first three observatories were selected after a careful personal examination of the regions by L. A. Bauer, that at Cheltenham in the spring and summer of 1899 and those at Sitka and Honolulu in the fall of 1900. Furthermore, as an additional precaution, 'J. A. Fleming was instructed that the selected sites were to be given another careful examination before the erection of the Sitka and Honolulu observatories. In both instances the choice of the original location was confirmed. The site of the provisional magnetic observatory at Baldwin, Kaus., was selected by VJ. C. Bauer and C. K. Edmunds. The four sit<:s have thus far proven satisfactory.
THE SITE 01'' THE CHEL'l'ENHAM MAGNETIC OBSERVATORY.

A number of sites within a radius of about 25 miles of \Vashington city, in Virginia and Maryland, were .examined, and the distribution of the magnetic elements tested before the final location was. decided upon. The problem of establishing a standard magnetic observatory, which is expected to have a life embracing the period necessary for the general magnetic survey of the United States, and which is to be within convenient reach of the office of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at Washington, required special care, and several months were accordingly spent before a decision was reached. As far as uniformity in distribution of magnetism was concerned, the magnetic survey of Maryland by L. A. Bauer, under the auspices of the Maryland Geological Survey, had already indicated that the region to the southeast of \Vashingtbn would probably furnish the best site in this respect, and the additional examinations resulted in the selection of that region. An area examined toward the northwest of Washington, embracing the region about Gaithersburg, Md., where one of the international latitude stations is situated, exhibited such remarkable local disturbances, even within the small strip of land occupied by the latitude observatory, that it had to be rejected at once as the site of a normal magnetic observatory. Suggestions regarding the selection of an island in the Chesapeake Bay received consideration, but this plan was abandoned in view of the possibility of disturbing influence from passing ocean steamers, and because of the difficulty of access at all times, and of transporting delicate instruments to such a place. The topographic sketch, page 310 (Illustration No. 2), shows the site finally selected, on the grounds of the Maryland Reform School, about 1 ?.:( miles west of the rnilroacl station at Cheltenham, reached from \Vashington or Baltimore via the Pennsylvania Railroad, changing cars at Bowie to the Pope Creek Railroad, a single-track branch of the Pennsylvania system. The traffic on this branch consists of two local passenger trains in the morning, one in each direction; two similar trains in the afternoon; and an occasional local freight train. The grounds of the reform school embrace about 800 acres, and are ~urrounded on all sides by farms of large extent. The site leased by the Coast and Geodetic Survey for an indefinite number of years comprises nearly 6 acres, and is

situated on the highest land between the Potom ac and Patuxent rivers, the altitude being about 225 feet above sea level. Cheltenham consists principally of the building· belonging to the reform school, about half a dozen frame cottages, two churches, and the railroad station. The land in this region, while in a flourishing condition before the civil war, when slaves were available for tilling the soil, is not now so desirable, and as far as can be seen at present, there will be little inducement to run electric car lines into this region. From the site of the magnetic observatory an extensive view is obtained of the country round about, and the opportunities are favorable for the successful prosecution of all the work planned for this observatory.

magnetic disturbances, special care had to be exercised. Sitka has steamer communication with Seattle about once a 'week throughout the year. The precise location at Sitka is shown on the map (Illustration No. 3), preceding page. The site used by the Russians from 1842 to 1867 on Japonski Island is no longer suitable and is occupied as a naval station. Owing to the mountains immediately back of Sitka it was not possible to get far away from the town. After a careful examination of various sites at Sitka by L. A. Batter and J. A. Fleming, the site on a Government reservation near the new Russian cemetery was adopted . This site has since been set apart for the use of the Coast and Geodetic Survey by special Executive order of the President of the United States. The magnetic observations made at the various sites examined revealed a sufficiently uniform distribution prevailing about Sitka.

Owing to the volcanic origin of the Hawaiian Islands, the ~equirements of a uniform magnetic distribution presented special difficulties. About a dozen sites on the Island of Oahu were inspected and tested, and usually pronounced local disturbances within small areas manifested themselves in one or more of the magnetic elements. Sites on the Island of Hawaii were also inspected. As the facilities of communication are best for the Island of Oahu, on which Honolulu is situated, this island received first consideration.

::VIAGNETIC OBSERVATORIES.

Observations made by L. A. Bauer and J. A. Fleming at various points 011 tl\e immense coral plain to the west of Honolulu and Pearl Harbor, while indicating small irregularities in magnetic distribution, served to mark out a site wit!1in which sufficient uniformity was secured. It was necessary to locate the observatory beyond any possible influence likely to arise from the large works to be erected at Pearl Harbor by the United States Navy Department and to provide against the possibility of electric-car communications of Pearl Harbor with Honolulu; also the observatory had to be sufficiently removed from the existing and contemplated mills and power plants of the neighboring large sugarcane plantation and of the adjacent sisal plantation. This necessitated putting the observatory over 2 Yz miles from the nearest village, in the midst of the coral plain, where, because of the absence of sufficient amount of tillable soil, the danger of encroachments from the plantations is minimized. This coral plain is mainly used at present as a cattle ranch. The map, opposite, of the Island of Oahu (Illustration No. 4) shows the location of the observatory on the coral plain west of Honolulu, the area of the site leased from the ranch company being 4.3 acres. The site is about twothirds of a mile from the railroad station, Sisal, on the Oahu Railroad, a single-track narrow-gauge road, the station consisting of the house occupied by the manager of the sisal plantation. From this station communication is had direct with Honolulu, distant 12 Yz miles in an air line and 20 miles by railroad.
THE SITE OF THE BALDWIN MAGNETIC 0BSBRVATORY.

This observatory, as already stated, was intended to be in operation for a brief period while the magnetic survey of the States in the vicinity was in progress, and no special buildings were erected, but such as already existed were adapted for the work. Baldwin is a small college town, the site of Baker University. This place, being surrounded on all sides by large farms and being centrally situated, offered a good place for a temporary observatory. Owing to the international magnetic work begun itl January, 1902, and because of delay in completing the magnetic survey of the neighboring States on account of the difficulty experienced in obtaining new magnetic outfits promptly, it has been necessary to continue the observatory longer than was originally contemplated. II. CONSTRUCTION OF THE MAGNETIC OBSERVATORIES. The following description of the construction of the Cheltenham, Sitka, and Honolulu magnetic observatories was prepared by the designer, J. A. Fleming, Aid, Coast and Geodetic Survey. No attempt at architectural display in the. construction of the buildings was made. In view of the uncertain life of a magnetic observatory, they were designed simply to fulfill as adequately as possible the requirements of the work 'vithout going to any unnecessary expense. The general design of the three obs~rvatories, Cheltenham, Sitka, and Honolulu, planned by the writer under the direction of the Inspector of Magnetic Work, is the result of a careful stndy of past and existing plans and methods. Besides the reports mentioned below, which. were utilized, special acknowledgment is made to Dr. Snellen,

This study indicated that, after the selection of sites well removed from all present and probable future local magnetic disturbance, the chief requisites desirable were: First, the elimination in construction of all materials showing any magnetic properties, even in the case of the variation observatory;* second, the arrangements for absolute

* Magneticians are not agreed as to the necessity of excluding magnetic materials in the construction of a building not intended for absolute determinations, but simply for recording the variations of the magnetic elements. The most notable case in Europe in which magnetic material was used in the construction of a variation observatory is the one planned with most scrupulous care by Prof. Heinrich von Wild, and situated at Pawlowsk, near St. Petersburg, Russia, red (iron-containing.) brick having been used. Professor Wild's argument was based on the assumption that the magnetic effect from the brick walls would be a constant one, and hence would not affect the variation or differential results. It is a well-known fact that the magnetic variations are functions of the absolute magnetic elements. If, then, the absolute values are disturbed, as they certainly will be inside a red brick magnetic observatory, the question arises whether the variations observed therein can properly be associated with the und~sturbed absolute elements observed in another and nonmagnetic building. Furthermore, it remains to·be proven that the effect exerted by the magnetic walls on both the variations and the absolute values is such that the observed variations can always be properly associated with the prevailing absolute values. This is a question which in the present state of our knowledge of the Earth's magnetism and of its variations can not be answered save by actual experiment. So, likewise, is it doubtful whether the magnetic effect of the brick walls can be regarded as constant, owing to their susceptibility to changes in magnetization with seasonal changes. The safest principle to be 1followed at present i~ the construction of magnetic observatories is to eliminate at the start any questionable cause o.f magnetic effect whatsoever, so as to simplify the solution of the causes underlying the many vexed variations continually occurring. The initial expense incurred by following this rule is a mere trifle compared to the aggregate cost of maintenance of an observatory for a long period. Test magnetic observations at the three magnetic observatories (Cheltenham, Sitka, and Honolulu), before the permanent mounting of the instruments, resulted in showing that the magnetic elements were the same within the error of determination in each case outside the buildings, in the absolute building, and in the variation building. Hence no question need arise in these cases as to the proper.correlation between the absolute elements and the variation observations.-L. A. B.

and variation instruments'to be suc;h that the mutual interaction of the various instruments would b~ inappreciable; third, the buildings for measurement of absolute values to be such as to admit of a number of simultaneous detenuinations without danger of appreciable mutual interaction of magnets of the various instruments; fourth, the building. for variation observations to be constructed so as to have as nearly a unifom1 temperature throughout the year as possible, without employing· extensive means for heating or cooling the rooms; fifth, the variation observatories to have accommodations foi;- at least two sets ~f instruments-one eye~reading and one self-registering set-and that they be of a size sufficient to meet all reasonable demands now and later. Three observatories-Cheltenham, Sitka, and Honolulu-are described in the order of their construction.
CmtLTENHAM OBSERVATORY:

As a r~sult 9f the first condition imposed above, the two structures, variation observatory and absolute observatory, consisting of an office flanked by two wings for the absolute observations, were built entirely of wood, and copper nails were used exclusively except when wooden pins could be substituted in framing. The greatest difficulty was found in selecting nonmagnetic material for foundations and piers, and ten samples of building stones were tested with the Adie magnetograph and all found more or less unsatisfactory. To overcome this difficulty, the foundations were designed to be 2~ feet deep of rubble work, surmounted by a grillage of 8 by 8 inch timbers, five pieces high. The materials were tested by bringing samples slowly within about five centimeters of an inclosed magneto~~ter needle, noting the change produced, and also' noting the .normal readings before and after samples were tested. The difference in readings sufficed to give a measure of the magnetic qualities of the sample in hand. Fortunately, at Cheltenham a marble was procurable practically free from magnetic properties~ The foundations of the variation observatory and of the piers extending to floor line were constructed of marble rubble work. Above the floor line some of the piers were built up to the desired height of cut marble pieces 12 and 8 inches thick, the separate pieces being doweled together with three five-eighths inch copper dowels set in plaster of paris. Other piers put in later are of sandstone, carefully tested. The instrument supports in the west wing of the absolute observatory were made temporarily of cedar posts of suitable heights inclosed with tongue and grooved casing and capped with hard-wood blocks. In the east wing of the absolute observatory the instrument piers are of nonmagnetic sandstone. . The chimney for the office being fairly well removed from observation centers, was designed to be of a white brick which from tests was found to have a very small magnetic effect; a stone rubble <:ons~ruction would. have been of inconveniently large section. For heating the office a. wood stove of soapstone slabs was designed; this did not prove satisfactory and was replaced by a copper-covered stove lined with fire brick. The question of hardware furnishings was also a source of difficulty, as nearly all of the so-called ''brass'' fittings were found to have iron parts which ~ade it ~ecessary to place special orders for the greater part of this material. The seco1id condition made it preferable that the buildings for absolute and variation observations should be separate ;:Lttd distinct, though questions of practical convenience required that they be as close together as possible without danger of appreciable

magnetic interaction between the various instruments. Rough calculations of the mutual actions between a C. & G. S. magnetometer and the Adie instruments for varying intervening distances were made according to formulre taken from the article by Professor ·von Wild referred to above. The effect was found to be practically zero, for the instruments mounted 40 feet apart, and the plans were made accordingly. The two'buildiltg!> were connected by a covered wooden corridor. In fulfilling the third condition the general plan already used by the Coast and Geodetic Survey at San Antonio, Tex., seemed best to follow. This consisted in erecting two buildings for absolute determinations, attaching the same as wings on either side of the office and connecting them by passageways. (Illustrations Nos. 1, 5, and 8.) The doors from the office to these wings and also the rear door of the west wing of the absolute observatory have glass panels, so that communication by signal, or otherwise, from one wing to the other and to parties in tents outside can be conveniently and readily made. The east wing of the absolute observatory has a bay window extension on the north side to accommodate the Wild-Edelmann observatory declinometer. (Illustration No. 5.) Thefourtlt condition requires that either some sort of insulation be provided if the variation observatory be erected above ground, or that the general use of an underground construction be followed. The success in the matter of uniform temperature conditions attained at the Dutch observatory at De Bilt, as well as the generally tmsatisfactory conditions prevailing in most underground observatories because of moisture encountered in such structures, confirmed the opinion that a building above ground could be built so as to safo;fy temperature conditions as well, or nearly so, as an underground structure, and would at the same time have the advantages of greater economy, convenience 1 and accessibility. The choice of insulating packing for the walls was a question of prime consideration. The manufactured. insulating materials on the market, on inquiry and examination, were found to contain more or less iron in their composition, and at the same time would have involved a much greater cost than permissible when used in such quantities as required. · After a careful consideration of the nonmagnetic materials available, carefully dried sawdust was decided upon as best adapted to the existing conditions. In deciding upon the necessary thickness of insulating wall to reduce annual mean temperature range to within 4° C to 5° C, Fourier and Poisson's formula,

In determining upon a proper thickness to sufficiently reduce mean annual range, the curves as shown on the diagram (Illustration No. 6). were constructed from values of L111 derived by

Thus, for a wall with 5awdust packing 4 feet thick, L111 for'Washington, according to the curve on the diagram, would be about 5°.r without artificial h~ating or cooling, on the assumption of ideal conditions. Perfect conditions were, of course, pi:actically impossible, but further insulation precautions were made as n.oted hereafter so as to bring about the best possible results. The wall insulation of the variation bbservatory is as follows (Illustration No. 7): Beginning at outside of building, pine. weatherboarding, 8-ply building paper, r-inch pine sheathing, 8-inch air shaft, 1-inch pine sheathing, 8-ply paper, 3 feet pine sawdust,

320

8-ply paper, seven-eighths inch pine ceiling, 3 feet 2 inches air space of passageway, seven-eighths inch pine ceiling, 8-ply paper, I foot pine sawdust, 8-ply paper, seveneighths inch pine ceiling. Slat ventilators or louvre windows are so arranged and provided with closely fitting shutters that during the winter the 8-inch air shaft referred to can be made practically air-tight, while during summer when opened these tend to admit of the passage and 'circulation of a cooling draft around building. The insulation beginning at the roof and going down is: Gravel and asphalt pitch roof, r-inch pine sheathing, 3 feet 8· inches air space communicating with 8-inch air shaft around building and provided with six louvre windows with close-fitting shutters as on those at the bottom of the air shaft, I-inch rough pine floor, 3-foot filling of pine sawdust, 8-ply paper, seven-eighths inch pine ceiling, 3-foot air space above rooms, I-inch rough pine floor, I foot 6 inches pine sawdust, 8-ply paper, seven-eighths inch ceiling. Insulation from bottom of foundation is 2 feet 8 inches of earth, 6-inch to 8-inch layer of screened gravel, about 3 feet pine sawdust, I-inch pine under floor, 8-ply paper, seveneighths inch pine tongue-and-groove floor. The greatest difficulty in obtaining the desired results lay in the necessity of providing openings through the walls for the ventilation of the rooms and for the means of ingress and egress. Four shafts, each 5 by IO inches and about 16 feet long, furnish the air supply to the passageway, through wooden floor grates. These are provided with heavy rabbeted shutters made to fit very closely and fitted with refrigerator fasteners, so that they may be. made air-tight. They are also provided at inlet with copper wire screens of double thickness to break force of wind blowing toward opening and to keep out such vermin as field mice. Ventilation of passageway is effected by four shafts opening into air space below the roof, each 6 by IO inches and about I6 feet long, provided with close-fitting slides. Ventilation of air space below the roof is effected by three 14-inch copper "Star" ventilators. By the judicious use of these air ducts and ventilators, the danger of direct conduction of temperature changes through the shafts can be entirely eliminated. Ventilation of the magnetograph rooms from and into the passageway is effected in each room by four 3-inch .square vertical shafts in the sawdust packing, having inlet or outlet just below the ceiling or above the baseboard, according to the arrangement of four closing slides provided for each. To carry off gases of combustion from the lamps of the magnetograph, 3-inch copper ventilators are prodded. Entrance into the building proper is had through a vestibule on the south side, as shown in the illustrations (Nos. 1, 5, and 8), 10 feet by I3 feet 8 inches outside dimen' sions. The walls of the entrance are built like those of the main building, without the air shaft and with only 2 feet of sawdust packing. The outside door can be closed before opening a second door in a small entrance hall, which is 6 feet wide and I I feet long; from this room a third door leads into an opening in the sawdust packing, whence a fourth door opens into the passageway around the rooms. In placing these doors particular care was taken to make them close fitting. Entra11ce into either of the magnetograph rooms is to be had only from the hall between the two rooms through 8-inch refrigerator-patterned doors packed with sawdust. The diurnal range of the temperature was thus reduced at Cheltenham to a matter of a few tenths of a degree, and. in fact, it is believed that even this small variation will be eliminated as soon as some other source of light than the present lamps has been

economy of construction would permit. The rooms are each 16 feet by 19 feet 6 inches, these dimensions giving ample space for the accommodation of the eye-reading Adie instruments in the south room, and for both the regular set of Eschenhagen selfregistering instruments and a test set in the north room. The hallway between the two rooms is 5.Yz feet wide. (Illustration No. 9.) The following general statements are of interest. The outside dimensions of the variation observatory are 36 feet by 56 feet by 24 feet high, with entrance IO feet by 13 feet. The outside dimensions of office are 18 feet by 22 feet, with two 5 feet by 7 feet passages leading to two wings for absolute observations, each IO feet by 12 feet, thus making the total length of the absolute observatory, inclusive of the office, 60 feet. As already stated, the east wing of the absolute observatory has a bay-window extension of 6 by 7.Yz feet on the north side. (Illustration No. 7.) The materials used were about 90 tons of building marble for foundations and piers, 85 ooo feet of lumber; a trifle over I ton of copper J1ails, and something more than 190 tons of sawdust and shavings fvr insulation. No satisfactory bid from contractors for erecting the buildings having been received, the construction was placed in the hands of the writer. 'fhe total cost of the buildings, including masonry and pier work, was something less than $6 900, which is $2 500 less than the lowest bid received. Some subsequent additions (piers, bay window, and covered corridor) have increased .the cost about $500. From Illustration No. 8 it will be seen that provision was made, by the insertion of an azimuth door in the south wall of the Adie room of the variation obse.rvatory, for sighting from a point inside, through the corridor and office, on' a distant azimuth mark whenever absolute observations are made inside the variation observatory. Attention is also called to the arrangement of the absolute instruments on a straight line passing east and west through the entire absolute building.
SITKA OBSERVATORY.

On account of the swampy condition of the ground at this observatory site, charred woo!:len posts, coated with tar and gravel and set in cement, were used instead of a stonework foundation. The piers are similar in construction, and were provided with hard~wood caps suitable to support the instruments. As a result of the prevailing moisture at Sitka it was necessary to replace these hard-wood caps by marble slabs. The posts are inclosed above the floor line with tongue-and-groove casing. A dwelling house situated opposite the selected site was leased as an office building, and the absolute observatory, ro by 12 fieet in size, was placed near it for convenience. The absolute observatory is, theref.ore, ·at a greater distance from the variation observatory than is the case at Cheltenham. The general construction of the variation observatory is similar to that at Cheltenham, save that a pitched roof is provided, the greater height so obtained offering a f!reater draft through the louvre windows at the sides. The wall insulation was designed to secure the results clesired at Cheltenham observatory, namely, a mean annual range of about s ° C. The insulation is as follows: Beginning at the outside of the building, pine weatherboarding, two thicknesses of 4-ply paper, r-inch pine sheathing, 2-i11ch by 6-inch studding, forming air spaces connected by auger holes at bottom through studding, 1-inch sheathing, two thick-

magnetograph room, two thicknesses of 4-ply paper, 1-inch rough pine floor, 13 inches of sawdust, 1-inch rough pine floor, 2-inch air space, two thicknesses of 4-ply paper, seven-eighths inch ceiling. The insulation from bottom up is: One-inch rough pine floor, two thicknesses of 4-ply paper, 2 feet 6 inches of sawdust, r-inch pine under floor, two thicknesses of 4-ply paper, seven-eighths inch tongue-and-groove floor. The ventilation system is somewhat improved over that at Cheltenham in that the air supply is admitted first into the entrance vestibule by two 6-inch by 8-inch by $foot shafts in the walls, thence into the passageway through two 5-inch by 8-inch shafts, instead of there being direct communication from the outside to the passageway. The supply of air to the magnetograph room is admitted from the passageway by three sets of ventilators. These· consist of 4-inch square vertical shafts in the walls, with openings at the bottom and top, both into the inner room and into the passageway, the rrpenings not being opposite each other, thus preventing entrance of light and dust. Ventilation of lamps from magnetograph room is effected by 3-inch zinc tubes to the attic space. ' Air communication from the passageway to the air space belO\V the roof is effected by two ·horizontal square shafts, 8 by 8 inches, at~d about 6 feet long. Ventilation of the attic is effected by a 20-inch copper ventilator. · As it was expected that both the eye-reading and self-recording instruments would be of the small Eschenhagen type, it was not necessary to provide two magnetogrnph rooms, as both sets could be accommodated, with the arrangements of piers shown in the plan, in one room 1 I~ by 14Yz feet. The vestibule is 6 by 9Yz feet, inside measure. The outside dimensions of the variation observatory are: 24 by 27 feet, with an entrance 9}-6 by 12 feet. The absolute observatory is 10 by 12 feet. About 35 ooo feet of lumbP.r aud 3 ooo sacks of sawdust were used in the construction. The lmil<lings were constructed under contract with James P. Jorgenson, of Juneau, Alaska, for $3 450. H. M. W. Edmonds, Magnetic Observer, Coast and Geodetic Survey, supervised the construction.
HONOLULU MAGNETIC OBSERVATORY.

Owing to the isolation of this station, an office with quarters for thP. observer had to be provided in addition to the two observatory buildings. On account of the excessive cost of building in the Hawaiian Islands the original plan to have this observatory similar to that at Sitka was abandoned and, in view of the more equable climatic conditions, the passageway was dispensed with, so that the instrument room is entered directly from the vestibule. The foundations and piers for both the absolute and the variation observatories are constructed of the coral rock which abounds in the immediate neighborhood which was found to be practically nonmagnetic in character. As the office had also to be used for living quarters where an uncertain amount of iron was likely to accumulate, it seemed best to remove it to some distance from the observatory. Owing to the natural conditions of the site the distance between office andobservatories is 450 feet. As at Sitka, a pitched roof was provided. The air supply and outlet are also similar . to those at Sitka with such exceptions as are necessary because of the omission of the passageway. The louvre windows to a 6-inch air space in the outer wall were made continuous around the bottom of the building, but were not provided with blinds because

the small annual range of temperature rendered them unnecessary. The upper louvre windows were omitted and a lower cornice board was used, thus allowing direct outside communication to an air space under the roof made by covering the underside of the 6-inch rafters with heavy 3-ply building paper well battened on. An outlet from this 6-inch air shaft and the attic was made through an open ventilator, as shown by the illustrations. This arrangement \Vas intended to accomplish the same result as the passageway and \Vas better adapted to the prevailing clim a tic conditions. The wall insulation is based on the same principles as at the other stations. The insulation is as follows: Beginning at the outside of the building, pine weatherboarding, 3-ply paper, 6-inch air space, r-inch pine sheathing, 3-ply paper, 2 feet 2 inches of sawdust, 3-ply paper, seven-eighths inch tongue-and-groove ceiling. The insulation, beginning at the roof and going down, is : Shingle roof, 6-inch air space, 3-ply paper,

attic air space, 3-ply paper, 2 feet of sawdust, r-inch rough floor, 2-inch air space, 3-ply paper, seven-eighths inch tongue-and-groove ceiling. The insulation from the l)ottom up is: 3 to 4 inches of broken coral rock, 2 feet 2 inches of sawdust, 3-ply })aper, seven-eighths inch tongue-and-groove floor. As at Sitka, accommodations for two sets of instruments were provided in one room , 12Yz by 14Yz feet. The vestibule is 6 by 9Yz feet, inside measure . The outside dimensions of the variation observatory are 18 by 20 feet, with an entrance 9 Yz by I 2 feet. The absolute observatory is 10 by r 2 feet. The office is r 2 by 16 feet, with a porch 6 by 12 feet, with a basement room for storage purposes, etc. , 12 feet by 22 feet. The buildings were constructed under contract with Philip Savary, of Honolulu, H. I., for $2 450. The work of construction was supervised by the writer, who also installed the instruments.

PREFACE.
The following appendix containing the results of the magnetic dip and intensity Qbservations made by the United States Coast and Geodetic Sun·ey between January, 1897, ancl June 30, 1902, together with the special publication, the United States Magnetic Declination Tables and Isogonic Charts for 1902, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, \Vashington, 1902, brings the publication of the results of the magnetic survey work up to the date June 30, 1902. Hereafter the results for each fiscal year will appear annually in the Report of the Superintendent. No attempt was made in the present publication to reduce the results to the same date. This would have involved a ·reinvestigation of . the secular change on the basis of more or less inadequate data. As the data required for this purpose will be greatly multiplied within a comparatively short time by the special field investigations now in progress, the labor itwolved in reducing the results to a common date and the 1 delay in publication, which would have followed, wer.e not deemed warranted at the present time. For similar reasons, and also because of some· of the reasons set forth later touching upon tHe corrections of the various instruments, it was decided not to make at present any correction for diurnal variation of dip and intensity, corrections which are generally on the order of observation errors. Experience has shown that it is questionable whether the expense of the great labor involved in the determination of these corrections would at the present stage be justifiable, and also, whether a real gain in accuracy would, in general, be obtained without having recourse to more observatories than now exist in the United States. For the observations made before the establishment of the present obsen·atories, and before the intercomparison of the various instruments, no other corrections than for secular change can safely be made. As far as determining the distribution of the magnetic elements over a region is concerned, when all errors in observation, reduction, and presentation of data are fully considered, experience has certainly taught that a more valuable contribution to science would often have resulted if the time which was spent in refining office reductions had bee11 devoted t(· acquiring additional field data. For all investigations which really require the utmost refinement in reduction, the results as given in this paper will be corrected, when warranted, in the papers devoted to those special investigations. The publication of this paper and of the Magnetic Declination Tables marks, in a certain sense, the close of the initial period of the detailed and systematic magnetic survey of the United States and countries under its jurisdiction, which was inaugurated on May 1, 1899. During this period, from May 1, 1899, to June 30, 1902, a little over three years, all the instruments ( 16 dip instruments and 15 magnetometers), have been

overhauled, modified, and improved whenever needed, and intercompared; four magnetic observatories have been established and the instruments with which they are equipped have been carefully examined, tested, and put in operation. I<)eld instruments of nearly every pattern now. on the market (English, French, German, and Russian), have been purchased, critically studied, tested and compared, and a variety of investigations relating to instrumental constants, standardizations, and methods of obsen·ation have been made. Twenty persons have been trained in magnetic work, and, in addition to special field investigations, the magnetic elements have been determined at about 800 stations (about one-fifth of the total number proposed for the general magnetic survey) and the results have been prepared for publication. The completion of this arduous initial work makes it possible to continue the magnetic survey (land and coast waters) and observatory work with unexcelled facilities and instrumental equipment. With this indication of future field activity, effort will be made to keep the· office computations and reductions up with the observational work, as nearly as that is possible, so as to insure prompt publication of the results. · Having published the magnetic survey results up to the date given, and made arrangement for the prompt publication of the results in the future, the attempt will be made next to put the results of the observatory work on an equally satisfactory basis.

I.NTRODlJCTION.

In Appendix 6 of the Report of the Superintendent for the year 1885 were published the results of all magnetic dip and intensity observations in the United States and adjacent territory made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey up to that time, together with similar data obtained by other observers collected from all a\'ailable sources. The publication also contained a discussion of the secular change of dip and horizontal intensity, by means of which the results were reduced to a common epoch, January l, 1885, and isoclinic and isodynamic charts were constructed. 'fhe intensity results were published in British units. · · In the Report of the Superintendent for 1897, Appendix l, this collection of results was brought up to date by the addition of observations made in the interval and the conversion of intensity results to C. G. S. units. The results were reduced to January l, 1900, by means of the secular change da~a discussed in Appendix l for 1895, and isoclinic and isodynamic charts for that epoch were constructed and published. Since 1896, and especially since the inception by the· Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1899 of a detailed magnetic survey of the United States, a great many results have accumulated, and a rediscussion of the secular change of dip and horizontal intensity and the publication of new isoclinic and isodynamic charts will soon be warranted and demanded. It is the purpose of the present appendix to present the results of observations of dip and intensity made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey between January l, 1897, and June 30, 1902, so that they may be available for reference, leaving their discussion for a future paper. The publication of magnetic declination results was brought up to the same date in the Magnetic Declination Tables,* just issued, and it is proposed hereafter to publish each year in the Report of the Superintendent the results of all magnetic observations made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey during the fiscal year covered by the report. The descriptions of magnetic stations occupied prior to July, 1882, were published in Appendix 9 for 1881; those occupied between that date and June, 1902, will be found described in the Magnetic Declination Tables referred to above.

MAr.NETIC DIP AND INTENSITY.

343

The columns in order, beginning at the left, contain the name of the State or Territory, number of dip results from other than Coast and Geodetic Survey observations up to 1885, Coast Survey results up to 1885, Coast Survey results for 1885 to 1896, and ~ince 1896; and th~ horizontal intensity results are classified in the same way in the last four columns.
RESULTS FROilf OTHER SOURCES.

Since the collection of l 885 very few dip or intensity results have been obtained from outside sources. A notable exception is the ~'.lagnetic Sun·ey of 1'.faryland made in the years 1896-1899, by Dr. L. A. Bauer, under the auspices of the Maryland Geological Survey, the entire instrumental outfit being loaned by the Coast and Geodetic Survey and part of the expenses in 1899 being defrayed by that organization. The three magnetic elements· were determined at over one hundred ~tations scattered over the State, but grouped more closely where marked local disturbances were found. The results of this survey have been published by the :Maryland Geological Survey under the title '' Second Report on the Magnetic Survey of Maryland.''

MAGNETIC OBSERVATORIES.

The Coast and Ge()detic Survey has in operation four magnetic observatories at which the variations of declination and horizontal intensity are recorded photographically. One, Cheltenl;am, i:; also provided with a vertical intensity variometer and the others will be similarly equipped. At each of these observatories the absolute values of the three magnetic elements are determined at least once a week. The one at Baldwin, Kans., has been in continuous operation since July, 1900; at Cheltenham, Md., since April, 1901; and at Sitka,· Alaska, and near Honolulu, T. H., since December, 1901.
I ~STR UJ\1 E::-<TS.

The greater part of the results here tabulated were obtained with instruments of the type shown in the plate opposite. The magnetometer i~ one of four cons!ructed in the Coast and Geodetic Survey instrument shop in 1892. It is of the Lamont model with such modifications and .improvements as have been suggested by experience. Among these may be mentioned the cloth hood connecting the end of the reading telescope ·with the magnet house, thus avoiding the use of a glass window; the long shank to the stirrup in which the magnet hangs, thus doing away with the need of a balancing ring to preserve horizontality of the magnet; the octagonal form of the magnet and stirrup, making it possible to suspend the magnet with scale horizontal without delay. The magnetometer may be quickly removed from its base and the small theodolite substituted for use in determining the latitude, true meridian, and local mean time. These instruments were originally supplied with wooden deflection bars, but experiments showed that changes in length of bar, due to moisture, were too great to secure the desired accuracy of results. Accordingly, in the spring of 1901, the wooden bars were replaced by bars of, bras..-; of such shape as to bring the deflecting magnet on a level with the suspended magnet without the use of a rider.

METHODS OF OBSERVING.

The horizontal intensity was determined in the usual way by combining observations of oscillations and deflections, so arranged as to eliminate as far as possible changes in the value of I-:l during the observations. The present practice is to begin with a set of oscillations, follow with two sets of deflections at two distances, and conclude with another set of oscillations. Dip was determined with two needles, their polarities being reversed in the middle of the set. If the results by the two needles differed by more than 5' observations were

COMPARISO"

OF DIP CIRCLES.

Recent investigations have shown that observations made at the same place with different dip circles will not, in general, give the same results. In spite of the reversals of face of circle, face of neeclle and ·polarity, there remains au error peculiar to ach circle and more especially to each needle. With a view to increasing the accuracy of the dip results, it was determined to investigate this source of error. Accordingly, a

adopted as the Coast and Geodetic Survey standard dip instrument for the present tables. Comparisons hetween it and dip circle No. 23 showed a difference of less than half a · minute. From Table III it will be seen that the two earth inductors of different construction and by different makers agreed with each other within o'.2. The standard adopted furthermore practically represents a mean of the 15 dip instruments of several varieties, as shown in the table. Since these comparisons a large obsenratory earth inductor of \Vild-Edelma1111 pattern, exhibited at the Paris Exposition in 1900, has been acquired and recently installed in the Cheltenham Magnetic Observatory. It is expected that this will be the final standard dip instrument, and that the portable Schulze inductor will be the intermediate instrument by means of which the comparisons between the standard instrument and the field instruments will be effected in the regions where the field instruments are being used. These tw6 earth inductors will probably agree so closely that no further· correction will be needed to the results here presented. The results of the comparisons made at various times and places are given in the following table. The figures- in the third and fourth columns indicate the instruments and needles used. Tims 23. 34 means that observations were made with dip circle 23, using needles 3 and 4.

CoRRHCTIONS To DIP CIRCLES.

The importance of these comparisons is at once apparent when it is seen that there is a range of nearly 15' in the results with different circles. Various causes probably combine to produce these differences, such as impurities in the brass parts of the instruments and imperfections or irregularities in the pivots of the needles. We may expect also to find that in some cases the difference between twp circles or needles changes as the dip changes and differe1it parts of the pivots are brought into play. While the above observations present some evidence in that direction, there is not enough to reach a definite conclusion. As the larger differences are confirmed by repeated comparisons, however, there appears to be sufficient justification for attempting to reduce all dip results to the same standard by applying corrections based 011 the above comparisons.

ACCURACY OF RESULTS.

An examination of the above comparisons of dip circles shows that dip results uncorrected for i.i1strumental error· may be in error by 5 1 or even more. As to error of observation purely, the same comparisons show that in general the probable error of a single set (mean of two needles) does 11,0t exceed i'. It may therefore be said roughly that dip ·results up to 1899 are uncertain by 51 and those since that time are probably within 2 1 of the truth. In the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey prior to the beginning of a detailed magnetic survey of the United States it was considered satisfactory if the probably error of a resulting value of horizontal intensity did not exceed one part in five hundred. \Vith the introduction of brass deflection bars and improved methods of observation the uncertainty has been reduced to I: I ooo, and with more accurate determination of instrumental constants resulting from the intercomparison of different instruments, it may be still further reduced to 1! 2000, or even less. These figures refer to a result from two sets of oscillations with two sets of deflections between, the whole operation '·occupying about an hour. Some further increase in accuracy can be attained by applying corrections for diurnal variation as the result of the continuous observations at magnetic observatories.

350

COAST AND GEODE'rIC SURVEY REPORT,

1902.

A comparison of ti1e results of horizontal intensity observations made at the same station with the different instruments (especially at Washington, D. C., Cheltenham, Md., and Baldwin, Kansas) bears out the above estimated uncertainty of one part in one thousand. In the case of magnetometers Nos. 10, 20, and 21, however, the results were found to be systematically too small as compared with the other magnetometers, and all observations since April 1901 with those three instruments have therefore been corrected as follows: No. ro +o.003H No. 20 +o.003H No. 21 +o.oo8H The trouble with magnetometer No. 21 (Moureaux-Chasselon magnetometer) was traced to impurities in the brass of which the magnet house is constructed, the time of vibration of the magnet differing materially when suspended in a magnetometer having a wooden magnet house. Similarly the large correction given in Table III for dip circle No. 24 (small Moureaux-Chasselon dip circle) was traced to impurities in the brass of the base and foot screws. . The above corrections constitute all that is warrantable, at present, toward reducing all intensity results to the same standard. As opportunity offers for further comparisons, however, it is intended to deduce for each instrument a systematic correction for reducing results by it to a standard instrument. The detailed results of the comparisons of the various dip instruments and magnetometers and their critical discussion will form the subject of a separate appendix by the Inspector of Magnetic \Vork for a future Report of the Superintendent.
ARRANGE:.!ENT OF TABLE.

The values of dip and horizontal intensity here presented are arranged by States alphabetically, the results for each State being given in the order of increasing latitudes. The latitude and longitude are in most cases the result of solar observations made with the small theodolite which forms a part of the magnetometer. With this type of instrument the latitude may, under favorable conditions, be determined within half a minute and the longitude within one minute of arc. In default of observations the geographical position was scaled from the best available map, either the U. S. Geological Survey topographic sheets, Post Route map, or Rand & McNally State map .. In such cases only the even minute of latitude or longitude is given. The horizontal intensity is expressed in gammas (y), loo ooo y being equal to one unit of intensity in the C. G. S. system. To save space, the designation of dip circles and needles has been contracted as follows: 2 r. ·12 in the column headed dip circle indicates that observations were made with dip circle No. 21 using i1eedles 1 and 2.

PREFACE.
The importance of securing uniformity in geographic nomenclature in all portions of the territory of the United States at the earliest practicable date being constantly felt in this office, Prof. V./. D. Alexander, Assistant United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, was instructed to compile the following list and glossary for the Territory of Hawaii. The brief biographical sketch of Professor Alexander is inserted to show his peculiar fitness for this task, and it is believed that he is the most .reli;ible living authority on the subject. He was born at Honolulu, Hawaii, April 2, 1833, soon after the arrival of his family in the islands, his father, Rev. \V. P. Alexander, having gone to the islands in 1832 as a missionary. He was educated in the mission school at Punahoa, near Honolulu, and at Harrisburg, Pa., and graduated at Yale College as salutatorian in 1855 with the degree of A. M. He was a tutor at Beloit College, \Visconsin, in 1856, and a teacher in an academy at Vincennes, Ind., in 1857. He returned to the islands in 1858 and held various positions of trust and importance, as follows: Professor of Greek, Oahu College; president Oahu College, 1864-1871; surveyor-general Hawaiian Islands, 1872-1901; member of privy council, l 884; member of board of education, l 887-1900; commissioner to International Meridian Conference at Washington, D. C., 1884; Fellow Royal Geographic Society, 1892; commissioner from the Provisional Government to the United States, 1893; member of Astronomical Society of the Pacific; Assistant United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, February l, 1901. He is the author of the following publications: A Brief History of the Hawaiian People; History of the Later Years of the Hawaiian 1'.fonarchy and of the Revolution; Brief Hawaiian Grammar; Introduction to L. Andrews' Hawaiian Dictionary; Ancient Systems of Land Tenure it! Polynesia; Relations between Hawaii and Spanish America; Proceedings of the Russians on Kauai; The Uncompleted Treaty of Annexation, 1854. His intimate acquaintance with the subject as surveyor-general of the islands for a term of twenty-nine years and his lifelong familiarity with the language make him a recognized authority, and the Survey is fortunate in being able to p.tblish this contribution from his pen.

HAWAIIAN GEOGRAPHIC NAMES.
THE PRONUNCIATION OF HAWAIIA:N WORDS.

The consonants in general are sounded as in English. :No distinction was formerly made between the sounds of J(" and T, or between those of L and R. The sound of the letter 1¥ generally approximates to that. of Vbetween two vowels. A is sounded as in father, E as in they, I as in marine, 0 as in note, U as oo in moon. Ai when sounded as a diphthong resembles the English ay or the Italian ai, and au the English ou as in loud. Besides the sounds mentioned ·above, there is in many words a slight gutteral break between two vowels, where the Polynesian Khas been dropped, as in i'a for ika, a fish. Every word and every syllable must end in a vowel, and no two consonants ever occur without a vowel sound between them. The accent of about five-sixths of the words iii the language is on the penult. A few of the proper names are accented on the final syllable, as Puako', Mana', etc.

OF HAWAIIAN GEOGRAPHIC NAMES.

It is very diffi'cult', if not impossible, to translate most of these names, on account of their great antiquity and the changes which mai1y of them have evidently undergone. 'It o.ften happens that a word may be translated in different ways by dividing it differently. Many names of places in these islands are common to other groups of islands in the South Pacific, and were probably brought here by 'the earliest colonists. They have been used for centuries witliout any thought of their original meaning. Sometimes they embody names of persons of whom no tradition remains, e. g., Ka-wai-a-Hao, "the water of Hao;" Ka-puu-o- Uo, "the hill of Uo," etc. Many names, however, are evidently descriptive, as Jlfauna Loa, "long mountain;" llfauna Kea, ''the white mountain' '-Mont Blanc; Puu Ulaula, ''red hill;'' Ka-punalwu, "the new spring;" 1<:a-lae-loa, the "long cape;" Ke,ala-i-KaMki, "the way to Tahiti, " the west point of Kahoolawe, etc. The compounds of T'Vai, "water,'' are numerous, as TVat"-awa, bitter water; TVat"manalo, brackish water; Wai-aleale, rippling wat_er; Wai-oli, singing water; TVat"-akea, open water; lVat"-lua, two waters, etc. Compounds of Hono, an obsolete word for harbor, are also numerous, as Hono-lulu, quiet harbor or Fair Haven; Hono-malino, calm harbor; Hono-manu, bird harbor; Hono-ult"uli, blue harbor, etc. In the vicinity of Honolulu the name Nuu-amt is compounded of mm, a step or terrace, and a1m, cool. Puowaina, Punchbowl Hill, is said hy native pundits to be a contraction of puu-o-wat"ho-ana, ''the hill of sacrifice.'' Manoa is the ''broad'' valley-,

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT,

1902.

Palolo, the ''clay'' valley; Ka-imu-ki, ''the oven for ti root,'' where the saccharine root of the Cordy line terminalis was cooked for food. Ka-U/zi means the ''outside edge,'' or boundary valley. Ka-moo-iliili is ''the pebbly strip.'' .1-fale-a-ka-la is generally translated "House of the Sun," but according to the ancient legend it is the place where the sun was ensnared by the demigod Maui, and the form of the same name applied to a mountain in Waianae, Oahu, is Hele-a-ka-la, "the trap of the sun." Hale-lea, a district on Kauai, is "house of joy." .k.'a-li/zi-kai means ·'edge of the sea,'' and .I<ai-lua, ''two seas.'' I<a-11, a district on Hawaii, is ''the female breast,'' and Ke-ala-ke-kua, ''the way of the gods,'' who haunted the precipices that overhang that bay. Ka-wela is "the hot" (place). The following is a glossary of the words most frequently occurring in Hawaiian geographic names:

PREFACE.
The immediate occasion for the publication of the second edition of this work, the first having appeared as Appendix 16 to the Report of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1887, was the formal vote passed by the International Geodetic Association on October 6, 1900. The resolution here adopted was a request to prepare a revised edition of the Bibliography. Since the issue of the earlier edition supplementary material has been constantly secured, but in complying with the wish of the association another inspection was made of the libraries of this country and of Europe, and in order to procure titles of such recent works of living authors as might escape notice, owing to delay in obtaining a place in the library catalogues, a circular letter was sent to.every mathematician whose address could be obtained. Each circular had appended to it the titles o.f all the known works of the recipient, with a request that omissions be supplied. This alone was the labor of several months, but was fully repaid in the gratifying assurances from many that nothing could be added, as well as the few additional titles which tend toward making this work complete. Special effort has been made to examine carefully catalogues of libraries, however small, bibliographies of the exact sciences, biographies of mathematicians, and trade lists of antiquarian books, in addition to such well-known sources as the Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific Papers, Repertorium of Reuss, etc. A ·most opportune assistance was furnished by Col. John Herschel, R. E., who, through the courtesy of the Royal Society, and ,\,ith the consent of the India Office, sent a manuscript supplement to his contribution to pendulum bibliography, which was published in Operations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, Vol. V. From this veritable treasure seventy-two new titles were found, each in the body of this work followed by (H). Most cordial thanks are due Colonel Herschel for his aid, as well as the confidence displayed in unreservedly placing such valuable material in the hands of another. The title "Bibliography" may appear as high sounding or inappropriate to a work in which all the refinements of bibliographic science are not observed. The entire collation is not always given, since a large proportion of the books have appeared in but one edition. The only well-defined purpose has been to give as much of the title as will enable one desiring the book to obtain it from any library possessing it, with the minimum effort to himself and the librarian. This object was also in view in preparing the abbreviations for the serial publications, which, it is hoped, may be amplified without looking for their equivalents in their alphabetical place. The scope of the work will easily make itself evident to the user. The intention was to include only such works as treated directly of the figure of the earth or described operations which could be used in determining that figure. The only digression from

this plan will be seen in the case of the pendulum, where the theoretical side is also included. This was done because of the belief that the pendulum will soon become a more important geodetic instrument, when it may be necessary to reconsider some of its theoretical features. Geographic position will be found in the work, but the purpose was to include discussions of the formulas by which latitude, longitude, and azimuth are computed, but not the methods of determining these elements by observations. A few treatises on surveying, bearing the word ''geodesy'' or its equivalent in the title, have been inserted with a remark indicating the character of the contents. As a rule, remarks are used simply to correct erroneous impressious which the title alone might make. The omission of papers on the variation of latitude will perhaps be the most marked. The reason for this is that the subject was too problematical at the time of the publication of the first edition to be included, and since that time' the work has been so dose to the astronomic side that it was deemed best to leave this subject to the com pilers of bibliographies of astronomy. The plan adopted is to use only one alphabet, in which will be found authors, abbreviations, and subjects. Full names of the authors have been given as far as possible, but in any subsequent repetition only the initials of their Christian names are given. The title will be found repeated under the name of each co-writer or each perso1i named in the title. A dash (-) in a title refers to the first name, given, as the one who wrote the review or about whom the article was written. This method gives, so far as entry is concerned, equal prominence to all persons named. An asterisk (*) after a title signifies that the work has not been seen by the compiler. Under the authors their works are arranged chronologically; in the case of serials, according to the date as gi,·en to the entire volume. This will be found advantageous when it is desired to find the full title from the abbreviated form as given under a subject. It is also believed that the insertion of an abbreviated title in the subject classification will be found helpful, as it will enable one to see at a glance if an author whose name appears under the desired subject has written upon the special theme sought for, without turning to the author catalogue. After each book title, and after the full title of each serial publication, there appears in parentheses the name of the owner of the work from which the title as given was taken. Of course it does not intimate that the work in question can be found only there. When a book was once found it was not again looked for. As a rule, those accredited to European libraries c.ould not, at the time of trial, be found in any library in America. While it is impossible to mention all who have assisted in the compilation of this work, it is only right to thus publicly express the thanks of the author to Mr. Cyrus H. McCormick, whose generosity made it possible to personally inspect the great libraries of the world, and to Mr. 0. H. Tittmann, Superintendent United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, for his prompt response to the wishes of the International Geodetic Association in making this work a part of his annual report.

Ivory (James). Additional discussion respecting the ellipticity of the earth as determined by experiments made with the pendulum. Phil. Mag. (Taylor), III, 1828, 2o6-210.
In deducing the figure of the earth from the obsen·ed length of the pendulum, I have always t~ought it necessary to leave out a few of the experiments that were inconsistent with the rest. The inconsistency is proved by comparing the pendulum on the same parallel, or nearly 011 the same, when a correctio11 must be applied. If they are excessively irregular, I always rejected such as were irreconcilable with the rest.

The method here referred to was that of Maurolico, first published in his Cosmographin, Venetiis, 1543. He determined the distance from th"' top of n mountain of n known height to the horizon; then, regarding the enrth as n sphere, computed the radius geometric:ally. The same method was afterwards adopted by others, each regarding it as original with himself.

Criticising the Ordnance Survey, saying their value of e is I : 149 and nu error of 11" would change it to I : 99 or 1 : 298. He also satirizes the method of allowing for spherical excess, which has been doubtfully computed, and showing their observed spherical excess gnve for R. values differing from one another by nearly 7,000 feet. He also obtains five equations which contain all that is needed for deducting, with the greatest possible probability of exactness, the latitudes and longitudes of the station, and the figure of the earth from geodetical operations.

Struve (absent in Spain). Returned, Struve indorses Dollen's advice. Together they lay it down that reduction for local attraction is (with ccrtait~ exceptions) only justi· fiable on nssumptions for which there is ordinarily no fou:>dation. The position is quite different front Laplace's, and in fact quite novel. Moreover there is no allusion lo Laplace's ruling-which appears to be very little known-on this point. ( H.)

Tiarks (John). On Mr. Dalby's method of finding the difference of longitude between two points of a geodetical line on a spheroid, from the latitude of those points and the azimuths of the geodetical line at the same. Phil. Mag. (Taylor), IV, 1828, 364-370.
The theory is: The sum of the three angles of any spheroidical triangle formed by geodetlcal lines is a function of the latitude of the angular points and their differences of longitude only, and Is altogether independent of the eccentric\ty of the spheroid. This sum is the same as the sum of the three angles of a spherical triangle whose angular points have the same relative situation to a particular diameter; that is, the same latitude and difference of longitude. As used on the survey, two of the geodetical lines are meridians, and one of the angular points is the spheroid.
