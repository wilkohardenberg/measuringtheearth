REPORT.
UNITED 8TA1'RS COAST AND GEODETIC SGRVEY OFFICE,

Washin.11ton, December 15, 1884. Srn: In compliance with law a.nd with the regulations of the Treasury Depa.rtmeut, I have the honor to submit herewith my report of the progress made in the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1884. Up to that date the general progress of the survey is shown graphically in the two maps (sketches Nos. 1 and 2) which accompany this report. During the past fiscal year field operations have been carried on in thirty States and three Territories, and in the District of Columbia. In conformity with the act of March 3, 1871, trigonometrical surveys were continued in nine States, which have made requisite provision for their own topographical and geological surveys. The tabular statement in Aµpeudix No. 1 shows the distribution of the field parties, and the nature of the work executed. It must be apparent upon a brief consideration of the extent of territory now included by law in the operations of the Survey that true economy, based upon a regard for the best interests of the public service, demands for each field party an appropriation based upon a careful estimate of the cost of its transportation to and from the locality of work, and the cost of keeping it in the field during the whole of the season most 9 milable for its operations. To be obliged to recall parties for want of funds during the best part of the working season, or to delay sending them till but part of a season's work can be accumplislled, are unavoidable results of insufficient appropriations. I would therefore most earnestly renew the recommendation made in my fast annual report that for the next fiscal year the sum appropriated for party expenses should be at least half again as large as it has been of late years. In the "Estimates in detail" I state the amount which can be e.xpended to advantage for this purpose. ' The arrangement of the parts of this report is the same as that of last year, Part I being mainly occupied with general statements of progress under the several hea.ds of Field-work, Office-work, Discoveries and Developments, and Special Scientific work, and with a statement and explanation of the estimates for the next fiscal year; in Part II appear the detailed recitals of field-work and a reference to the office-work; in Part III are comprised the several appendices relating to field and office work which are published annually, and such professional papers, discussions, and reports, as illustrate the methods and results of the Survey.
H.EL43-1

PART I.
Reference may be made to Appendix No. I, as showing in a geographical arrangement the localities of the several operations in the field, beginuiug at the eastern part of the coast of Maine, and following southward to the southern point of Florida and thence along the Gulf coast to the Rio Grande; passing then to the southern part of the coast of California anu going northward to Alaska; and in the interior States, beginning with those uearest to the Atlantic coast. Among the more important developments of the past fiscal year, affecting immediatel,y the interests of commerce and navigation, may he me11tio11e1l the location of a dangerous ledge in Englishman's Bay, coast of Maine; the development of ledg·es off .Minot's Ledge light hmrne, lfassachnsetts Bay; the discovery of several dangerous shoals in Monomo;\· Passage; tlie location of a dangerous rock off ·warren's Point, R. I., and of dangi,rous ledges i11 Fisher's Island Sound; the discovery of rocks in East River. N. Y., uear ~orth Brother and Riker's IslandR, aud of a dangerous rock in East River in the prolongation of Twentieth street; near Nes Rock; the survey and development of dangerous shoals off Cape Henlopeu, and of important changes of high-water line near that point. To these and other dangers, attention was promptly called by the publication of "Notices to Mariners." In the general geodetic work of the Survey, and the special scientific investigations incidental to it, the report enumerates the following operations, which by their importance demand mention here: The completion at Lake Ontario of the connection of the triangulation of the Coast and Geodetic Sun·ey with that of the Lake Survey; the ad rnnce toward completion of the resurvPys of Long Island Sound, and of Delaware River and Bay; the survey of the boundary lines between the States of Pennsy lva!1ia and West Virginia, for the J oiut Commission of those States; the completion at Washington of the series of comparative determinatious of grnvity with the Ka,ter pendulums; the determination in ~eographical position of the corner-st-0nes and boundary monuments of the District of Columbia, and the advance toward completion of tlie topographical survey of the District; the beginning of lines of level of precision connecting the tidal levels of Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico with the transcoutinental line of geodesic leveling; and the continuation of the primary triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel for connecting the triangulation of the Atlantic coast with that of the Pacific. Two officers of the SurYey were sent to Europe on special duty during the year; one of them to London, Paris, Brussels, and Geneva to make certain experiments with pendulums and comparisons of standards ; the oth~r to represent the Surn~y at the seventh conference of the International Geodesic Association at Rome.

The usual disposition has been made of all records of field-work in the varied departments of the Survey carried on during tue past fiscal year. All such records of reconnaissance, triangulation, astronomical aud magnetic observations, topographic and hydrogruphic sheet,,;, tidal records, physical geographj·, hydrography and gravity researches, and tl10se relating to every description of scientific inveRtigation carried on during the year have heen registered in the ardiives and referred to the appropriate di\isions of the office. Drawings of fort;r maps and charts l1a\ e been in progress; of this number eighteen have been finished, including twelve photolithograpl1s. Three minute aud carefully drawn maps have been made for the use of the Treasury Depa:·tment, showing the limits of all custom-house districts in the United States. · A new feature has heen introduced in tile reproduction upon the original scale of important plane-table sheets; thirty-four such sheets barn been carefully inked for this purpose. Numerous drawings and diagrams ha Ye been made for illrnstrations to the annual report, and sixt;y-nine tracings arnl drawings hase lweu furnished in answer to calls for information from other .Departments of the Go,·ernment, an<l from private parties. :Models of the Western Atlantic Basin and of that of the Gulf of Mexico have been made in plaster and progress made upon the large map of the United States. Eighty-two pr~jcctions ba,·e been made for use of the topographical and h,ydrographical parties in the field, and fifteen pr<~jections haYe been finished on copper for new charts. Ten new charts have been begun 011 copper, while sHen cliarts and thirty-six sketches on copper haYe been completed. Corrections and additions ha Ye been made on four hundred and tweuty-8iX plates; fifty-one thousand and thirty-sm·en prints have been made from copper; of tliis number fise thousand two hundred and twenty-six were for illustrations to the Alaska Coast Pilot, and ninety-six were transfer-proofs to be printed from stone.

III.-DISCOVERIES AND DEVELOPMENTS.

General reference has already been made to the di8coveries and developments of the past fiscal ;year affecting the safety of navigation, with mention of the more important of these discoveries. The "Notices to .Mariners," printed and widely circulated during the year were as follows: No. 40 (October 31, 1883) gave the result of the examination of a dangerous rock off \Varren's Point, R. I., known locally as "Elisha's Ledge." No. 41 (November 9, 1883) described dangerous rocks on the coast of Maine, between Old Man and Old Woman Ledges, near Monhegan liglit-house, and ledges off the Damiscove Islands. No. 42 (November rn, 1883) reported the disco\'ery of a reef not before known in Eggemoggiu Reach, coast of Maine, and described rocks in East River, N. Y., near North Brother and Riker's Islands. No. 43 (November 26, 1883) gave notice of a dangerous shoal and extension of the point oft' Cape Henlopen, the existence of which had been developed in the course of the survey of Lower Delaware Bay. A shoal.inside of Delaware Breakwater was also reported and described. No. 44 (December 8, 1883) warned navigators of a sunken wreck in the Potomac Rh·er bet.ween Blackistone Island and Piney Point. No. 45 (March 20, 1884) reported that the recent reaurveya in tb vicinity of Nantucket Sho&llil

had developed the existence of !Several dangerous shoals between Shovelful light-vessel and PoBock Ripiight-vessel, in Monomoy Passage. No. 46 (l\fay 37~ 1884) contained notes on dangers in Neva antl Peril Straits, and on anchorages in FisL Bay, Southeastern Alaska. No. 47 (l\Iay 28, 1884) gave notice of tlaug·erous ledges in Fisher's Islaml Sound. No. 48 (May 31, 1884) warned m1,·igators of a dangerous pinnacle rock in East River, N. Y., on the prolongation of Twentieth strPPt. A <lauger buoy has since been placed on this rock. No. 49 (·lune 1, 1884) reported thP existence of a dange.rous ledge in Euglii,;hmau's Bay, i1ea1· the eastern entrance of l\Ioos-a-bec Heach, coast of .Maine. ..

INTERNATIONAL GEODESIC ASSOCIATION.

The importance of the questions to he discussed at the seventh annual conference of the International Georlesic Aggociation, heM at Rome in October, 1883, and the desirability of continuing the. intimate I'('lation1' heretofort- t~Xi1'tiug hetween the Coast aud Geodetic Sune.\' and similar organizations in :Europe, led to the detail of an officer of the Survey, under authority from the Secretar.\· of the Treasury, as a delegate to that Uonfcrence. The letter of convocation of the Conference having indicated as one of its leading objects the consideration of the question of the unification of longitude by the adoption of a universal prime meridian, and of the unification of time by the adoption of a universal time, the delegate on the part of the Smvey was instructed to express the opinions entertaineJ by scientific and practical rueu in the United States in relation to the same. He was instructed also to take occasion to urge upon the IJouference the desirability of expressing an opinion in favor of the several Governments participating iu a Diplomatic Conferenw· at '\Yasliington, as propoxed hy this Government, for arriving at a settlement of the questions rueutioned. After due deliberation, the eonclnxions of the conference, rt,presenting fifteen separate nationalities, were formulated in a series uf resolutions, to be brought to the knowledge of the several Governments, and recommended to their favorable consideration. This action led to the meeting of the Diplomatic Conference held at 'Washington in October, 1884. Special report has been made by the delegate of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in regard to the part taken by him in the discussions.
DETERMINATIONS OF GRAVITY .A.ND COMPARISONS OF STANDARDS.

Reference was made in my last annual report to the detail of au Assistant in the Survey for the purpose of obtaining in Europe certain observations necessary to complete the connection of the American ancl European initial gravity stations. This duty involved the measurement of tlie flexure of the l~cpsold pendululll tripod at the observatories at Kew, England, and GenEwa, Switzerland; the charge of the coustruction of new pendulums and of apparatus for gravity investigations, and special inquiries respecting matters discussed at the Gravity Conference. Papers relating to the JD(·thod adopted for the measurement of tiexure, and to the eft'ect of flexure of a }leudulnm upon its time of oscillation appear as Appeudices 15 and 16 to this report. Advantage was also taken of this detail to have made comparisons of the iron yard No. 57, belonging to the United States Bureau of Weights and Measures, with its mate, No. 58, deposited in the ordnance office at Southampton, and with the hronze yard No. 6, known as the "~enerator," and kept at the British Standards Office. The Arago platinum kilogram of the United Statse

Weights and Measures Bureau was transported to the International Standards Bureau at Breteuil, for comparison. The valuable series of comparative determinations of gravity by means of tbe Kater pendulums was completed at Washington early in the fiscal year by the Assistant in whose charge they had b~P,n placed to be swung at the Transit of Venus station of 1882, at Auckland, New Zealand, at stations in New South Wales, British India, and Japan, and at a station in San Francisco. A. full report of these observations appears in Appendix No. 14. At Washington, the station occupied was the one at the Smithsonian Institution, at which these pendulums had been swung by Lieutenant-Colonel Herschel, R. E.
PROJECTION TABLES, AND FORMULA!: AND FACTORS FOR LATITUDE, LONGITB"DE, A.ND AZIMUTH COMPUTATIONS, BASED ON THE CLARKE SPHEROID.

In February, 1880, the Clarke spheroid of 1866 was adopted by direction of the Superintendent as the basis of development _of the area covered by the entire operations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. It superseded the Bessel spheroid, which had been iu use since 1844, and its adoption made desirable the preparation of new 1:>ditions of the Pn~iection Tables, and of the auxiliary tables for the computation of geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths. The new Projection Tables appear iu Appeudix No. 6. They have been computed under the direction of the Assistant in charge of the office, and cover the entire distance from the equator to the pole. Some changes 11,nd additions in the body of the tables will, it is hoped, make them more convenient for use. They have beeu prepared for the polyconic vrojection,* so long in use upon the survey, but answer equally well for all kinds of conic projections. In Appendix No. 7 is giYen a third editio:1 of the Tables of Formula- and Factors for the computation of geographical positions. The first edition appeared in the Report for 1860, Appendix No. 36, and the second in the Report for 1875, Appendix No. 19. The present edition bas been carefully revised by the Assistant in charge of the Computing Division, unuer whose direction it has been prepared.
THE RUN OF THE MICROl\IETER.

In Appendix No. 8 is ginu an investigation of Uw facts and courJitions whicb slionld guide au observer in determining for the different fractional arcs measured on tbe graduation of a theodolite the due apportionment of the run of the micrometer, or the quantity b,y which the micrometer measures more or less than the prescribed number of the seconds of the graduation. This in>estigation is followed b.Y examples showing the forms of record and reduction as employed in actual field-work, and also methods of formiug tables of rnn-correetions by means of which these corrections can be readily applied during the progress of the obserrntions. Tables of this character, in manuscript form, have long been in use by obseffers and in the Computing Division of this office.
BOUNDARY LINES BETWEEN THE STA'l'ES OF PENNSYLVANIA. AND WEST VIRGINIA.

Reference was made in my last annual report to a request from the Joint Commission of the States of Pennsylvania and West Virginia for the detail of officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to execute the work of tracing out the boundai·y line between Peur:s,ylvania and the "Pan Handle" of West Virginia. The two Assistants assigned to this duty completed the survey and marking of the boundary early iu the fiscal year, the line adopted by the Joint Commissioners being a straight line through the sont,hwest corner of Pennsylvania and the first stone south of the Ohio River, which had been placed in the meridian of ,the .large granite monument marking the south end of the boundary line between the States of Pennsylvania and Ohio. Subsequently, with my approval, a further request from the Joint. Commii;sion was acceded to-the tracing out of a portion of the boundary uetween Pennsylvania and West Virginia run·See Appendix No. 15, Report of 1880, for an iwcount of this and other projections.

ning eastward along the parallel from the southwest corner of Pennsyh'ania to the Maryland corner. Full reports of this work, with detailed maps of the two boundary lines, have been transmitted to the Joint Commission. Duplicates of these reports and maps are preserved in the archives of the Survey.
CONNECTION AT LAKE ONTARIO OF THE PRillrA.RY TRIANGULATION OF GEODETIC SURVEY WITH THAT OF THE LAKE SURVEY. THE COAST .A.ND

In Appendix No. 9 is given the result of the' computation and adjustment of the main triangulation across the State of New York, which connects at Lake Ontario the triangulation of Hudson River and Lake Champlain with that of the United States Lake Survey. That portion of' the triangulation of Lake Champla.in which forms the immediate basis of the work across the State of New York was executed between 1876 and 1879, and this work itself between 1880 and 1883. Upon Lake Ontario the work of the Lake Sur\·ey was done between 1874 and 1878. The general accuracy of the Coast and Geodetic Suryey work is expressed numerically in the report, ancl the satisfactory character of the junction of the two Government surveys is pointed out in the length of the line Sodus-Oswego, on the lake shore. The discrepancy amonnts to but 1-52800 part of the length of this triangle-side, or about an inch and a quarter to the statute mile. In latitude, longitude, and azimuth, the accordance of results is equally satisfactory. In making this and other jnnctions with the triang-ulation of tl1e Lake Survey, which, as wt>ll as our own, has been developed on tl!e Clarke spheroid of 18HG, tlle usefulness of that work will be extended, and its results can readily be brought into harmony with those of the Coast and Geodetic Surve;v.
LONGITeDES DEDUCED IN THE COAS'l' AND GEODETIC SURVEY FRO)[ DETERMINATIONS BY :MEANS OF THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH BETWEEN THE YEARS 1846 AND 1885. SECOND ADJUSTMENT.

Appendix :No. 11, on longitudes deduced in the Su~vey from determinations by means of the electric telegraph, is a ntluable contribution, i11 t,he form of a general table of results for longitude and their probable errors, from the time of inception of the method, and the first transmission of telegraphic signals in 184f> to the middle of the year 1884. It coutains also the resultiug longitudes of all stations between the measures of which mathematical conditions exist requiring adjmitment by the use of the method of least squares. A preliminary adjustment aud report on telegraphic Iongitmle results was published as Appendix: No. 6 to the !~port for 1880. The paper now referred to gfres the re1mlts of the second adjustment, and was demanded by the ad1litio11s made to the field longitude work since 1880. These additions comprise new stations, as well as new conditions between old and new stations. The general table contains one hundred and fifty-se,·en separate longitude determinations. In the discussion has been included the longitude of Df'troit, Mich., the fundamental longitude station of the United States J,ake Snrvey. A value has been derived also ·fol" the longitude of Ogdeu, Utah, which is the principal point of reference for the longitudes obtained in the United States Geographical Surveys west of the one lmndredth meridian. Reference is made in the report to the relath·e accurw~.r of the results of the American and European s)·stems of telegraphic longitudes, and it will be seen from the comparison given of the average probaule error of a lmrgitude determination by the two systems that the results of the American s.vstem compare favorably in accmacy witl1 those of tlie European.
TRIGONOME'fRICAL DETER:MIN.A.'l'ION OF THE HEIGH'l'S OF THE STATIONS OF THE DAVIDSON QUADRILATERALS.

A further contribution t-0 bypsometIT is made in an appendix (No. 10), in a discussion of the trigonometrical measures for the heights of that part of the great triangulation of California koown as the Davidson quadrilaterals.

The experimental study of atmospheric refraction in connection with meteorological conditioni:, for the purpose of increasing the accuracy of the determiuatiou of heights from obsrrmtions of zenith distances, bas of late years claimed much attention in Emope as well as here, and it is believed that the present paper will he regarded as an advance in this kind of research. It is based upon the theoretical considerations of the atmospheric refraction as given hy Jordan, whose researcbes were found to l>e most directly applicable in connection witb the results deduced from the special experiments made in 1880 on the stations l\Iount Diablo and Martinez East. TlJese results were given in my report of last year (Appendix 12), and it is there pointed out that trigo. nometrical 11ypsometry stands much in need of results from similar direct observations of hourly zenith distances, continued day and night, with conespoucling meteorological obserrntions, to be made in localities having a distinct climate, in order that for these spedal regions the results of their discussion, especially with reference to decrease of atmospheric temperature with increase of altitude, may be advantageously employed in the computations for heights.
COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY EXHIBIT AT THE SOUTHERN EXPOSITION.

In Appendix No. 18 is given a brief account of the exhibit made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey at the Southern Exposition, held at Louisville, Ky., in the summer aud autuum of 18:s3. · The sever.al branches of field-work of the Survey were illm1trated by a collection of instruments and apparatus; t be results of the work by sets of the charts and other publications. Sets of standarus of weight and measure, and a line and end comparator were sent as specimens of the results of work and of the apparatus employed in the office of weights and measures. The exhibit made by the Government, in which eigllt other Bureaus were represented ueside the Com;t and Geodetic Survey, was a marked feature of the Exposition, and to it were coutined most of the displays of a scientific character. · Two awards were made to the Survey-one, a medal for the exhibit as a whole; the other, a diploma, for the liue and en<l compamtor.
PHYSICAL HYDROGRAPHY.

The advance toward' completion of the resurvey of Delaware River and Bay has furnished material for the study of the physical hydrography of that important high way of commerce. A paper foreshadowing the probable results of this stud.v has been submitted by the as.sh1tant who has been specially charged with the con~ideration of this and kindred subje~ts. Comparittons already made between the recent hydrogmphic surveys and those of forty years ago have affur<led means of determining the nature aud extent of physical changes in important localities. A report embodying the results of som0 of these investigations appears as Appendix No.12. The services of the assistant by whom this report was prepared, and who has had charge for some ye'lrs of one of the bydrographic parties, were made available during a portion of the fiscal year to the United States Advisory Commi8Sion for the improvement of the navigation of the Delaware by his detail as consulting engineer.
GEOLOGY OF THE SEA BOTTOM IN THE APPROACHES TO NEW YORK BAY.

. .

The existence of a submarine river-channel in the sea-approaches to New York Bay, as developed by recent hydrographic surveys, has led to a discussion of the probable origin and formation of this channel which will be of interest to geologists and students of physical hydrography. This paper appea.1'8 as Appendix No. 13.

EXPL.AN.A TION OF ESTIM.A TES.

The estimates for the Coast and Geodetic Survey are presented nuder the following heads: "Party expenses" comprises the pay of those temporarily employed as recorders, signal-men, hands, cooks, drivers, or boatmen, as the case may be, the subsistence and transportation of tile parties, aud all requhiite materials, tents, boats, and all other necessary expenses incident to the work. "Furnishing points for State surveys" gives the amount proposed for extending the geodetic work in different States. "Transcontinental geodetic work" proposes the sum to be expended for continuing the triangulation connecting the work on the Atlantic coast with that on the Pacific, including the line of leveling between the two oceans. "Pay of field officers" comprises the pay of the regular staff of surveyors. "Pay of office force" comprises the pay of persons regularly employed in the office. "Office expenses" provides for the purchase of material of all kinds required for the use of the office. " Rent of office buildings,'' "Publishing observations," and "Repairs and maintenance of vessels." The estimates under these several beads are substantially the same as appropriated for during sernral years. past, except the first item, that for "Party expenses," which is increased for the following reasons: In order to conduct the work with reasonable economy, it is requisite that surveying parties should continue in the field at the several localities where the work is in progress during the whole season of favorable weather. The expenses of moving the parties and their equipments to and from their several localities of work, which are for the main part remote from ordinary facilities, are 110 greater for a season of seven months than for one of four months. For the sake of main· taining a proper economic relation between party expenses and results, the Superintendent reoom· mends an increase of about one-third in this item. The additional item of f18,000 for resurvey of New York Bay and Harbor is introduced at the instance of the maritime and commercial bodies of the city of New York. The commercial impor· tance o(the port of New York is so great ~hat a constant watch should be kept on the changes in the harbor, and the Department recommends the appropriation asked for this purpose. The last item, for" Repairs and maintenan<lfl of vessels," is $12,000 less than last ytar, that amount having been specifically appropriated to provide new boilers for the steamer Bassler, which bas now been done.

RICHARD D. t)uTTS, Assistant, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, died in Washington on December 13, 1883. .Mr. Cntts was born in Washington, September 21, 1817. Having been appointed Subassist. ant in the Coast Survey, June 1, 1843, under the Superintendency of Mr. Hassler, he reached the grade of Assistant under Superintendent Bache less than three years later. That the fine abilities and untiring energy of Mr. Cutts were fuJly appreciated by Professor Bache is shown, not only by the rapid promotion accorded to him, but also by bis assignment to duty iu po'litions of great responsi'bility, where quick perception, sound judgment, and a readiness to meet every emergency of his profession were essentials. For five years during the early times of the settlement of California. he wa.s in charge of the triangulation and topography upon that coast; upon being relieved from that duty in 1855, he was appointed United States surveyor under the reciprocity treaty with Great Britain; in 1861 he became a member of General Balleck's st.aff and served with distinction till the close of the civil war. Soon after Professor Peirce became Superintendent he was appointed by that eminent geometer inspector of the secondary triangulation of the Survey, in order to introduce a more thorough system into the field-operations; in March, 1873, the President sent him as honorary commissioner to the Vienna Exposition; at the date of his assignment in 1881 to the charge of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Jffice, IJe had completed the connection of the primary triangulation of the New England coast with that of the Hudson River and of Lake Champlain. His failing health under the steady pressure of office duty excited grave apprehension among his friends, but their hope was that his journey to Rome as the representative of the United States at the annual meeting of the International Geodesic Association would recruit bis strength and insure his being spared to them and to the work for some years to come. ·This hope wa.s not destined to be fulfilled. On his return he was warmly welcomed, and soon resumed the active charge of the office. But signs of failing health were only too evident. He remained at his post, though, till he was prostrated by an attack which in less than a week had a fatal termination. With his associates on the Survey his rememlJrance witl ever be present as that of a valued friend, a man of warm heart., instinctive honor, great ability, and thorough devotion to the interests of the Survey. ACTION
~'.A.KEN

AT THE OFFICE OF THE COAST A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

At a meeting of the Asl!!istants and othel'. persons employed in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, held at the office of the Survey, December 15, 1883, upon the occasion of the death of Richard D. Out ts, Assh!tan t in charge of the office and topography, the Superintendent, having taken the chair, spoke as follows: There devolves upon me the painful duty of announcing the death of one of our oldest aud most faitbfnl l\S8ociates. Richard D. Cutts, Assistant, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, died in tbia city on December 1:), 1883, in the sixty.seventh year of his age and the forty.first year of his service on the Coast Surn~y . .Assistant Cutts was born in Washington, D. C., in September, 1817, and entered the Uoast Survey in June, 1843. Au expt·rience previously acquired upon the North· east Boundary Surve,y, added to liis native ability, soon brought hiEl name into ]lrom· inent uotice; anti the prompt and efficient discharge of every duty assigned showed bo.w Wt'll placed was the confidence so earl~' reposed in him. Dmfog his connection with the Coast Survey bis labors have been exten(led into every department of the work. In his t>arlier ,years bis eifort8 were directed towards raising the standard of topographical work, which be di<l with ~miuent success. Of late Jears the higher scientific work of tbe Survey bas occupied his a.ttention,and his operations ha \'e extended to all parts of tbe country. The shores of the Chesapeake1 the coasts of the Pacific, the plains of Texas, and the mountains of New Englanct equally bear teRtimony to bis professional ability and untiring energy. To hini the navigators of the Pacific are indebted for the first surveys of San Francisco, San Diet.?o, and Monterey Bays, and some otb& minor harbors on that cooet. On sev~ral occasions be bas represented this Governmentin iDtemational matters. In 1855 he was appointed ~United States surveyor upon tbe lnt.ern&tional Fish.-

eries Commission for the settlement of the limits of the fishing grounds between the United States and the British dominions in North Ameriea. Throughout the civil war he performed distinguishecl services, retiring with the honorary rank of brigadier-general. In 1873 be was one of the United States Commissioners to the Vienna Exposition; and only two months before his death he attended the International Geodt:'sic Conference at Rome, as the representative of the United States in that conference, which was held with the special view of cousidtring the question of a universal prime meridian and the unification of time. For two years before his death he filled the poRition of Assistant in charge of office and topography, and the manner in which be di;;cbarged the arduous duties devol'f"ing upon him was but in keeping with his discharge of e\·er,v trust confided to him. Distinguished as he was for his professioual acquirements, he was even more noteufor the possession of every quality that markH the perfect"geutleman. \Vise in counsel, firm in purpose, unswerving in principle, gentle in mauner and kind in hoort, be was a .man without tear and without reproach; and to us who remain behind be leans an example worthy of our highest emulation. Remarks were made by Assistants Edward Goodfellow and H. G. Ogden, and by Commander C. M. Cbestt>r, U. S. N., Hydrograpbic Inspector. The following telegrams, addressed to the Superintendent from Assistants unable to be present were read: From Assistant Boutelle.: Say for me that I grieve with yon for the accomplished officer and noble gentleman whom we all loved so dearly. From Assistant Davidson: The Assistants ou the Pacific join in the sorrow of those on the Atlantic in the grievous loss of General Cutts. Hill tlevotion to the work of the Snrwy, his ability in execution, and his integrity in administration commanded the respect and admiration of all his brother workers. To the older officers he was endeared by the early associations and anxieties of the Survey in the beginning; to the younger· ones by his active interest in it11 continued success and development; to all by the ready sympathy and genial encouragement of a great heart and a clear head. We appreciate but cannot express in words the deep bereavement of his family. The following resolutions were then unanimously adopted, after which the meeting adjourned. " 1. That the able and faithful services of ueneral Cutts during the forty years of his labors on the S11rvey and his fidelity to the public interests in the discharge of the responsible duties of his position wake his loss one to be deeply deplored. "2. That the traits happily combined in the character of our bonond aE<sociate, bis som1d judgment, absolute integrity, and kindliness of heart gained for him the respect and confidence of his brother officers, and the warm attachment of his friends. "3. That the officers and members of the Survf'~' assem hlt>d here to-day desire to have placed on record this expreSRion of their great loss, both personal a11d official, and they would ask the privilege of extending their deep sympathy to the family of General 011tts in their bereavement."
FERDINAND H. GERDES, Assistant, United States Ooa&,t and Geodetic Survey, died in Wash· ington, June, 27, 1884, in the seventy-fifth year o(. his age. Mr. Gerdes was not only the oldest of the Assistants, but the senior on the work in point of service, having entered the Slll'vey as Subassistant in June, 1836. He was born in Hanover, Germany, September 15, 1809. The training he had received in the land of bis birth had its usual character of thorou.ghness, and was enforced by habits of close application and unremitting labor upon the part of its recipient. He rose rapidly io. his protes1:1ion, ancl was appointed Assistant in 14arob, 1837, and assigned by Superintendent Hassler to the charge of a topographical party on the abores of Long Island Sound. · Betw:eeu 1841and18" he was engaged in primary triangulation in New Jersey and Maryland, and in topographiea.l work on Dela.ware Bay and River. In 1844, wben the need of ooginning the survey of the coast of the Gnlf of Mexico became aumifeist,Su:Perintend~nt Baehe showed.bis appreciatiou of Mr. Gerdes' capabilities by assigning to him tlae obar·e <>f that im1>0rtant reconnaissance, a11d the execution of the triangulation that it

16

UNITED ST.A.TES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

should develop. He thus became the pioneer of the Snrv<!y on that coast, and was identified for many years with its progress. Soon after the outl>reak of the civil war he was assigned to special service with the Gulf Squadron under command of Admiral Farragut, and subsequently to duty on the Mississippi, Yazoo, and Arkansa_s Rivers in the fleet commanded by Admiral Porter. Both of these officers acknowledged the valuable co operation of Assistant Gerde'1, and attributed to bis work much of tbe success of the naval operations. Towards the close of 1864, a commission having been autlwrized by Congress to examine and report on sites for a navy-yard in Western waters, Assistant Gerdes accompanied the commission as topographer, and on ueiug relieved from that duty was directed to report to Admiral S. P. Lee to continue surveys ~m the Mississippi between Uairo, Ill., and 8aint Mary's, Mo~, and on the Tennessee and Lower Ohio. The reconnaissance charts which were among the results of these surveys were highly appreciated bJ the officers of the Mississi11pi 8quadron. For the two years following the close of the war Mr. Gerdes was iu charge of the hydrography of tbe Passes of the :Mississippi; between 1867 and 1875 he was engaged on special surveys in which his long experience on the work had become of exci>ptional rnlue. During this period he made a resurn·y of the approaches to New York for the Harbor Commissioners; an elaborate report for the Light-Honse Board on changes in the channel of the Hudson with reference to the location of lights on that river between Hudson and .Albany, and complett'd a topographic and hydrographic sur\·ey of the Haritan Rirnr and Valley from South .Amboy to New Brunswick. Bis strong constitution and robust frame succumbed but slowly to the infirmities of advancing age and the inroadH of ill health, and his indomitable energy kept him part of every season in the field till within little more than a year before his death. His last duty was performed on Long Island in the winter of 1882-'83, when he gave his personal supervision to work at a time when the ground was frozen and often covered with snow. Iu the death of JOHN R. BARKER, draughtsman and artist, which occurred February 28, 1884, the office has sustained a serious loss. Mr. Barker was born in Philadelphia, April 29, 1824, and in early life serrn<l as passed midshipman in the Navy. Resigning to enter upon civil pursuits, he cultirnted his taste for the arts, and in 1873, having entered the service of the Coast Survey, was assi~ned to duty in making the views required for the Coast Pilot. The graphic delineations of the ap1Jroaclles to nearly e\·ery harbor on the Atlttntic coast, and the artistic sketches of prominent headlands and other features which illustrate the volumes of that work are due to bis skillful pencil. Some of the finest of bis views are those of the Hud1:1on River. .About two years before bis death, Mr. Barker took up the art of etching, and with great succe1:1s, many of the views of harbors on the southern coast being from his own etchings. His quickness 'of perception, skill in execution, and entire devotion to his work cannot easily be replaced. Mr. .A. SENGTELLER, who had served continuously in the office as topogra-phical engraver for twenty-seven years died on the 11th of .August, 18'S3. He was a native of Poland, but came to this country from Paris iu 1856. His work was marked by strong characterization of topographical <let.ails, combined with harmony of tone, and many of our best charts bear witness to his skill. Mr. Sengteller had reached his seventieth ~ear. Mr. GORDON A. STEWART, ke.eper of the archives, died after a prolonged illnese November 19, 1883. Mr. Stewart was born in the town of Monroe, State of Ohio, April 18, 1833. He received a legal education, and had entered upon the practice of the law just before the beginning of the civil war. In April, 1861, he volunteered in an Ohio regiment, and rose rapidly to distinction, having reached the grade of lieutenant-colonel not very long after bis enlistment. Hardship and exposure in the field gradually undermine(\ his health, and in 186-1: compelled bis retirement from the Army. His connection with the Ooast and Geodetic Survey Office began in 1874 in the capacit~ of librarian; iu 1875, he was transferred to the archives, where be remained till his death. His last years were passed in suffering from a disease, the seeds of which were sown during his service in the war. Mr. .A. YEATMAN, who had been in the employ of the office for thirty.one years as carpenter, died on the 2d of December, 1883, in bis sixty-eight-h year. Mr. YeatmaD bad been master t:ar· pe1,1ter since 1856. Be gave to the work intrnsted to him his best skill as an artisan, and devoted to it the serupnlous care and integrity which were eharacteri8tic of him as a man.

PART I I.
Statt'ments in detail of the operations of the parties of the survey, afield and afloat, are given in this part of the report in a geographical order~ and arranged under the beads of the several sectional areas into w11icb for convenience of reference the territor.r of the United States has been divided. Beginning at the northeastern part of.the coast of Maine, work upon the coastR 'and within the borders of the New England States is noticed, proceeding theuce to accounts of work done upon the coasts and within the boundaries of the Middle aud Southern States; thence to the Pacific States, commencing at tlrn southern part of the coast of California and proceeding northward to Alaska, and thence to the work executed in tlie interior StatPs. A tabular statement of the distribution of the sewral partie!<, the names of the persons engaged in the work, and the nature of the work performed appearR in Appendix No. 1. The charge of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office was continued with Assistant Richard D. Cutts until his a8signrneut to dut;y as a delegate to the annual conference of the International Geodesic Association at Rome in October, 1883. During his temporary ahsence Assistant Charles A. Schott was directed to act in hiR stead. On the return of Assistant Cutts towards the close of November, he resumed his duties as Assistant in charge of the office, though evidently in failing health. Early in December, he was prostrated b,y an attack which on the 13th of that month proved fatal. This sad event called forth from his associates on the work expressions of their deep sense of personal loss, and tributes of rl:'spect to his memory, which are placed upon record in Part. I of this report. Until January 7, 1884, Assistant Charles A. Schott was acting as Assistant in charge. At that date Assistant Charles 0. Boutelle, who bad been designated to succeed Assistant Cutts, entered upon his duties. The report of the operations of the office during the fiscal year, accompanied by the reports of the chiefs of its several divisions, as presented by the Assistant in charge, appears in Appendix No. 4. Commander C. M. Chester, U. B. N., Hydrographic Inspelltor, has submitted a comprehensive report of progress during the fiscal year in the several branches of hydrographic work committed to his charge. Thei;;e include the care and maintenance of the vessels of the Survey; the direction of details of bydrograpby under my general instructions, and the oversight of the work of the hydrographic draughtsmen in the office. This report, which appears as Appendix No. 5, bears witness to Commander Cht'ster's careful and energetic supervision of all operations under his charge.· Special refere.nce is made in it to the valuable ~ssistance rendered him by Lient. J.E. Pillsbury, U. S. N., on duty as assistant hydrographic inspector, in charge of chart corrections, &c., up to January 29, 1884, and after that date by Lieut. Jefferson F. Moser, U.S. N. Upon being detached from office duty, Lieutenant Pillsbury was instructed to take charge of the preparation of the manuscript of the Atlantic Coast Pilot from Cape Henry southward. The verification by actual inspeetion of the courses and distances, and the collection of the la.test data. for this volume involved hydrographlc service on the outside coast, reference to which will be made under the heads of Sections IV and V in this part of my -report. Much of Commander Ohesfier's time during tbe year was necessarily devoted to the performance

of his duties as inspector on the 11art of the Government of the construction of the steamer Carlile P. Patterson, for service on the coast of .Alaska. Lieut. Richardson Clover, U. S. N., who had been associated with Commander Chester in the preparation of the plans and specifications of the new vessel was assigned to the immediate oversight of the details of construction in New York, while Passed .Assistant Engineer H. N. Stevenson, D. S. N., superintended the construction of the machinery at Philadelphia. The Patterson was successfully launched January 15, 1884, and is now · on her voyage to the Pacific. .A full report of her construction, equipment, and adaptability to the special service for which she was designed will be prepared by Commander Chester at as early a date as practicable.

Triangulation of the coast of Maine between West Quoddy Head and Cross Island.-In order to determine the points required tor the continuation of the topographical and hydrog1aphical survey of the eastern coast of l\iaine, Assistant 0. H. Tittmann organized a party in pursuance of instructions issued in July, 1883. The secondary and tertiary triangulation which he executed covers the ground between West Quoddy Head and the eastern end of Croi;;s Island. Stations were established about a mile apart along the shore between the points mentioned, and, with but few excep· tious, were marked by holes (}rilled i11to the solid rock, so as to be permanent and easily recoverable. The smoke of forest fires burning in the locality of the work seriously interfered with its progress. Field operations were closed a bout the middle of October. The statistics are as follows:

Boyd took the field, in pursuance of instruction~, early in July, and having determined in position the points needed, carried the stuvPy of the shore-line from Cow Point, on the east side of Mason's Bay, around Little Kennebec Bay and the Point of Main, joining the Machias Bay shore-line surveyed in 1882 at Starboard Creek. This work is in the towns of Jonesborough, Machias, aud Machiasport. The shore-line of Holmes Bay was theu completed iu the towns of Machiasport, Whiting, and Cutler to a junction with t.Iie sun·ey of 188:&; thm1 finishing the shore-line survey of the mainland 1 the islands and the ledges of Little Kennebec a11d Machias Bays, both branches of Machias River to the first bridge1:1, and of Iloltnt'S Bay and the western fa..ie of Cross Island. As regards weather, the season was generally a favorable one, except during the month of September, when the atmosphere was obscured by dense smoke from forest fires. Mr. T. P.

pursuance of instructions directing that officer to oontinue off-shore soundings westward from Oross Island at the entrance of Machias Bay, and to make a detailed hydrographic survey of Mud Hole Channel betwetin Head Harbor Island and Great Waiss Island. Upon the arri\·al of the Gedne;v at Machiasport, Me., July 10, work was actively begun; signals were established at every interval of clear weather, and a few lines of off8hore i;oundiugs were run, but :u; the frequent fogs, with sni"oke from forest fires, retarded thi8 part of the work greatly, it was decided by Lieut. Commander A. S. Snow, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Sun·ey, who had reliernd Lieutenant H ugbes in command August 15, to give attention for a time to the inshore soundings entirel.v. Not unfrequently the sheet of water between Head Harbor and Great 'Vass Island, the localit~· . of the boat work, woul<l be comparatively free from smoke and fog, while the off.shore signals, standing higher on the islands, were completely hidden from Yiew. By the ~9th of September, the atmosphere being much clearer, and the i:mrwy of :Mud Hole Channel and vicinity ha\·ing been practically completed, off-shore soundings were again begun and carried on until the close of the season. With reference to the hydrographic Slnve~· of :Mud Hole Oliaunel, Lieuteuaut Commander Snow remarks that hi11 sheet, scale 1-10000, covers the area between Head Harbor, Steel Harbor, and Great Wass Islands (local1y known as Eastern Bay, in contradh·tinctiou to \Vesteru Bay, to westward of Great Wal-ls Island), and includes Head Harbor between Stel'l Harbor and HPml Harhor Islands. It offers 8lweral harbors of refuge to coaster:,,; wuo are familiar ,,·ith thl' locality, is mnch used in heavy weather, and may be easily entered by any oue prodded with a cliart. It proddPs also a passage to Moos-a-bee R~ach from the sea, which is often U8ed by fh1herme11 awl small ,·e:ssel,.; familiar with the locality, but a8 this passage is tortuous, beset with cfa11gerous ledges, not buoyed. and accessible only to light-draught vessels lutving a leading wind, it Hhouhl not be attempted b~· strangers. · Owing to the large number of ledges, it was deemed necessar,y for the proper de,·elop~ent of the bottom to run the lines of soundings no farther apart than one hundred meters, and this distance was maintained, except neitrer tlie sea, when it was increased to two hundred meters in deep water. The general direction of the lines was parallel to the general trend of the .shores; these lines being crossed by normals to the shore. All of the ledges with regard to which any information could be obtained, or which were suspected by the character of the Rournlings, were visited at low water, an<} two hundred and ten positions and soundings taken and reduced t-0 the plaue of reference, the ledges being mostly uncovered at mean low water. In all cases of uncertainty, or where the lines did not cross in a satisfactory manner, they were run over a second time. Tb<' character of the bottom, except on ledges, generally soft mud. Full details and descriptions-the results of very close examiuatio111:1-are giHu in Lieuteu-. aut-Oomma.nder Snow's report respecting the rocks and ledges in Mud Hole Channel and Yicinity. Soundings were taken also to the westward of Fisherman's Island, to develop the bottom in the vicinity of Egg and Sea Horse Rocks, and lines were run with the ship parallel to the general trend of the shore, and quite near to it, from Sea Horse Rock to Head Harbor Island. The lines of off-shore soundings were run out to distances of 10 mi]eg, and about eigl1t-tenthR of a mile apart, beginning with the moRt westerly line, near Nash Island, and carried to the eastward-as weather permitted-to Oross Island, near the eastern limit of the projection. Starting from the coast in from twenty to forty fathoms (which is obtaiaed in close proximity to it), the lines were run in a sonth by east. direction the required distance, th<m east by north eight-tenths of a mile, then returning to the coast north by west. When the coast was reached at an early hour, shorter intermedialie lines were run about two miles off shore aml back. Crossing lines wen' also run at a distance of two and four miles from the coa13t. The soundings were found to be very irregular, varying from· twenty to ninety fathom8, a~d the bottom, a.a shown by the specimens obtained, is generally brown mud, with shells. No regular observations of curr..·nts were made in com11equence of there being no anchorage for the vessel otf the coast, but observations of the drift were obtained during the progress of the work, a.nd a current of three·qnarlers to one knot found, the flood tide setting to the eastward, the ebb t.o the westward. Between Great Wass and Fisherman Islands the ebb tide sets up the bay, escaping t.o the westward through the various pasllages. From the East.em and Machias

is

Bays the ebb sets to the southward, until it meets and joins tbe current near the coast, when it turns t-0 the westward. To obtain a plane of reference for tbe soundings, observations of tbe tides were made daily near the steamer's landing at Jonesport, between the hours of 6 a. m. and i p. m., every fifteen minutes, from July 20 to October 31, inclusive. A supplementary tide gauge was established on Steel Harbor Island, which was connected with that at Jonesport by simultaneons observations. The old bench-mark at Jonesport could not he found. A new one was estabfo;hed, and the reductions for all soundings were computed from the tidal observations (during the hours above named) of two lunar months. Lieutenant-Commander Snow's survey developed a dangerous ledge in Englishman's Bay, near the eastern entrance of Moos-a-bee Reach, the least depth over it being nine feet. "Notice to Mariners No. 49," issued in June, 1884, gives the bearings of this ledge, with directions for avoiding it. On November 1 the .Gedney left Jonesport, and on her way to New York Lieutenant-Commander Snow made an examination of the localit~· between Ohl Man and Old Woman Ledges, southeast of l\fuscongus Bay, near which a dangerous ledge bad been reported by Maj. 0. W. Raymond, United States Engineers. A ledge of small extent, having a depth of 12 feet over it, was found, and the bearings and distances of prominent point8 in the vicinity were given in "Notice to Mariners No. 41." The officers attached to the Gedney were Ensigns H. M. Witzel, T. M. Brumby, A. L. Ha11, and J. H. Hetherington, U.S. N. Fgr the interest which they took in the progress of the work and their zeal for its advancement, Lieutenant-Commander Snow expresses high commendation.

Topographical sttrveys of Harrington River and of Oltandler'11 River Bay, llft:.-Under instructions issued in July, 1883, Assistant Eugene Ellicott proceeded to Jouesport, Me., and toward the close of that month began tlle work of filling in topography upon a i,iheet which ha<l been begun by Assi11tant Dennis, comprising- Harrington River, Ripley's Neck, and tlle town of Harrington, Washington County, Me. This sheet was completed near the end of .August. Mr. Ellicott then took up the survey of the western shore of Chandler's Uiver Bay, and carried it around the shores of Mason's Bay, and thence to include both shores of the entrance to Chandler's River.

Completion of the hydro.qraphic surveys of Narrag'Uagus Ba.y and River, and of Pigeon Hill Bay, coast of Maine.-Having organized his party on board the schooner Eagre, in pursuance of im;trnctions received in June, 1883, Lieut. E. D. F. Heald, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Sur. vey, upon arriving in Narraguagus Bay. early in July, began the hydrographic survey of that part of the bay included between its entrance and Ralf Tide Ledge. The projection, scale 1-10000, which waR furnished to him for tbi~ survey, included also the upper pa.rt of Pigeon Hill Bay. Lieutenant Heald's work exhibits a Yery complete development of this loca.Jity by close lines of soundings, joining on the westward with Lieutenant Colby's sur. vey of 1882, and on tbe southward with that of Lieutenant-Commander Jewell in 1878. A careful

Topographical s1lr·veys bet1ceen G01tldsborough and Frenchman'i; Bays, cuai;t of Jfoille.-Tht> "peci al topographic work assigned to Assistant A. ,V. Longfellow by instructious dated iu June, 1883, was the filling in of additional topographical details upon certain sheets which bad been partly completed by Assistaut Rockwdl in 1862 and 11'65, but upon which, for the pnrposeR of the engraYed charts, it was desirable to haYe the roads and buildings shown, as well as the grouud contours of the interior. Ha,·ing arrived iu the field at Winter Harbor about the middle of July, ~Ir. Longfellow found it necessary to select and determine with the plane table numerous supplementary signals, the country being found to be Yery rough and so O\'ergrown with trees and hushes as to be extremdy difficult of access and affording but little outlook or comma11d of the ground. Not unfreqncntl.r, after tbc occupation of a statiou, the plane table had to be dismounted an<l packed in order to reach the next one. Extemiive forest fires raged in Gonlrlsborough and on ~fount Desert during August, aud at times approached so near the locality of work as to threaten the headquartPrs of the party. By the middle of October, when field operations were discontiuued, the topography lwd been finished over the area of Schoodic Peninsula, around the shores of Winter Harbor, and to a poiut about three and a half miles north of it.

Hydrographic eraminations on Pemaquid and Outer Heron Island Ledges, coast of Maine, and IpaWJich Harbor entrance, coast of Jfassachusetts.-Depths having been reported much less than now shown on the charts on the Pemaquid and Outer Heron Ledges, to the eastward and southward of Booth Bay entrrince, Lieut. J. E. Pillsbury, U.S. N., assistant bydrographic inspector Coast and Geodetic Suney, was directed in Jnne, 188.3, to proceed to Booth Bay, and examine the ledges referred to. His instructions iuclu<led also a vii,;it to Ipswich, Mass., to examine the vicinity of the entrance to Plum Island Sound, so aR to determine the extent of changes in that locality. With reference to the shores in this neighborhood, Lieutenant Pillsbury remarks that, being composed almost wholly of sand, nearly every winter gale changes the conformation of the shore-line as well as of the bottom, and that the range-beacon has not unfrequently to be changed to follow the movements of the channel from about a northea~t course to one to the southward of east. The recommendations submitted by Lieutenant Pillsbury will be considered in the preparation of future editions of the chart of Ipswich and Annisquam Harbors. While in Portland, on his way to Booth Bay, a ledge, known locally as "Southrast Ledge," off the Damh1cove Islands, was reported as dangerous, and upon examination Lieutenant Pillsbury found a small patch of rock having a depth of seven fathoms upon it at mean low water. Another ledge, called "Poor Shoal," of the same character, having a depth of six and three quarter fathoms over it, was found to the southward and eastward of Bantam Rock. The bearings aud distances taken from these ledges were published as part of " Notice to }fariners No. 41." While not dangerous in smooth weather, they become so when a heavy sea is running. Lieutenant Pillsbury's examination of Outer Heron and of Pemaquid Ledges showed least depths of 8! and 111 feet, respectively. Omitinuation of the triangttlation of tile Sta,fe of New Hampshire.-Geodetic operations in New Hampshire were resumed by Prof. E.T. Quimby, .Acting Assistant, in accordance with instructions, early in July. The tir1St station occupied was Moore Mountain, in Brookfield, Uarroll County. Fine observing weathC'r facilitated the progress of observations at this station; by the 4th of August all that were needed had been obtained, and in a few days more the party was ready for work on Green Mountain, in Effingham, Carroll Oounty. Here many delays were met with, arising in part from haziuess in the atmosphere, and in part from the persistent brush fires lighted by the farmers for clearing· land, some of these fires creating dPnse smoke in lines that it was desirable to observe. These obstacles prolongetl the occupation of the station until the close of September. The remainder of the season was occupied by Professor Quimby in determining the direction of the line Whiteface-Green Monntain, and in a reconnaissance in Rockingham County, to fix upon points suitable for extending the triangulation in that direction. The statistics of the work, which was closed in October, are as follows : ·

Occupation of stations in continuation of tlte triangulation of tlte State of Vermont.-At Mount Equinox, in the town of Manchester, Benniugton County, Vt., a station was occupied at the beginning of the season of 1883 by Prof. V. G. Barbour, Acting Assistant, in accordance with instructions directing him to continue the triangulation of the State. This station having been previously occupied in the primary triangulation, but little cutting to open lines of sight was requirerl, and by the 24th of July the work there was completed. Stowell station, iu the town of Rockingham, Windham County, was next occupied. For the purpose of connecting the Vermont geodetic work with that of New Hampshire, in this locality, signals were erected at Stoddard and Monadnock, and observations made upon these poinh1, as also upon signal~ previously established at Croydon and Chesterfield, in New Hampshire. Field-work was closed September 10. The statistics are:

.liJxaminati<Yn of ledges in Lake Ohamplain.-Certain shoal spots having been reported by the Light-House Board as existing in Lake Champlain and not shown upon the charts, Mr. Charles Junken, Acting Assistant, was directed to proceed to Burlington, Vt., in November, 1883, and make the necessary bydrograpbic examinations. His report shows that both of the shoals referred to are shown upon the charts, the first one, known as "City Reef," having upon it a least depth of 4i feet. The second shoal was shown on the chart by the name first given to it, "Champion Rock," from the name of the vessel that struck upon it in 1863; subsequently, however, it received the nam.., of her captain, and became locally known as "Jones Rock." Mr. Junken determined with out doubt the entire identity of "Jones Rock" with "Champion Rock," and recommends that this rock, as well as "City Reef," be buoyed. Subassistant W. Irving Vinal rendered prompt and efficient service in tl1e work. Reconnaissance for the i·ntroduction of additional lines in the triangulation between the Fire Island and Massachttsetu and Epping base lines.-In order to Rtrengthen the connection in the primary triangulation between the Fire Island base and the l\Iassacbusetts and Ep11ing baises, Assistant Cliarles 0. Boutelle was instructed to make the arrangements necessar;v for a reconnaissance from certaiu primary stations in Massachusetts and Connecticut, with a Yiew to d1~termine the intervisibility of the points proposed for occupation. Under his direction Mr. J. £.Boutelle, extra observer, visited Waclmsett Mountain, Princeton, Mass., and Bald Hill in Suffield, Conn. The lilles that it was desirable to obtain were Wachusett-Greylock, Bald Hill-Greylock, and Bald Hill-Bald Peak. At Wachusettthe summit of Greylock, near the northwestern part of the State, and distant about sixty-eight miles, was found to be distinctly visible. From Bald Hill both Greslock and Bald Peak, the latter in the southwestern part of Massachusetts, aie \'isible. The introduction of these lines into the triangulation, in connection with those from Ivy Rill in Connecticut and from Bald Peak to Greylock, will materially strengthen it. The reconnaissance intrnsted to him having been satisfactorily completed, Mr. J.B. Boutelle transmitted to the office the records of the work. Hydrographic e;ca1ninations in Vineyard Sound and resurvey of .Llfonomoy Passage, Nantucket 8hoala.-The hydrograpbic examinations and resurveys required in Vineyard Sound, Monomoy Passage, and on Nantucket Shoals, in order to obtain data for correcting the published charts, were executed during tie summer of 1883 by the party on the steamer Blake, under command of Lieut. Commander W. H. Brownson, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and G-eodetic Sun'ey. Leaving New York on the 11th of July, Lieutenant-Commander Brownson anchored on the following day inside of Cuttyhunk Island, at the western entrance to ·nrwyard Sounu, for the purpose of making an exarninatiQn of certain rocks, reported as at that time not properly shown on the charts. Two rocks were determi11ecl in position, one of these being Whale Rock, which is bare at half tille, and readily seen at any time by the discoloration of the water ; the other a pinnacle, with eight and a half feet at low water. Both of these rocks have been placed upon the charts. A detached shoal having been reported as existing at the western end of L'Homme Dieu Shoal, Vineyard Sound, the examinations made by Lieutenaut-Com1mi,nder Brownson indicated a very decided change iu the western end of the shoal, it having worn away and a book having formed to the southward; hence the detached sl10al given on Eldridge's chart is simply an extension of L'Homme Dien. The examinations in Vineyard Sound having been finished, Lieutenant-Commander Brownson started for Monomoy, stopping at Hyannisport on the way to locate a rock in ;New Harbor, to the w~tward of Hya.nnisport, Mass. On the 18th of July wai;i begun the principal work of the season, the reimrvey of Monomoy Passage, Mass. Finding by experiment that at P~wder Hole, Monomoy Point, where it had been at first intended to erect a tide-gauge, the ebb and flow of the tide was to~ much impeded by the narrow entrance, a gauge was established on the wharf at Harwich Port, Mass., and a companion gauge was kept for a suitable time outside near Monomoy Point. Lieutenant-Commander Brow.n!!On Rtates that bis work shows a gradual filling in of the channel between Pollock Rip and Broken-Part-Pollock Rip; that the average depth of witter over the sho&la

to the we8tward of this channel seems to be increasing, thus restoring· the equilibrium, and that
be thinks it not at all improbable tbat in the course of a few years tbis channel will be useless to wssels of heavy draugbt. That part of the channel to the eastward of Pollock Rip light-ship, formerly much use<l by Rhips of l1eayy draugl1t passing in and out of Yineyarcl Sound, is now shut oft' bJ a bar runuiug uearl;r across it, with seve11tee11 feet at mean low water. Should this shoaling continue '50 as to shut off these two channels for heavy-draught vrsseh1, there still remains the main chauuel between Grc>at Point, Nantuckd, and the Stone Horse Shoal. An extended exami· nation of thi:-; localit~· showed that a channel of twenty-four feet can easil;y be buo;yed out. This new channel would increase the distance of vessels bound around the cape about eleven miles, and would be another point in farnr of constructing a Cape Cod canal. ~e,-eral dangerous shoals having been denloped by Lieutenant-Commander Brownson's sur· vey between SboYelful liglit-wssel and Pollock Rip light-nssel, consisting of patches with a least depth of thirtl'<·11 and a half feet near tbe northern extremit;r, ant1 forming an extension of Stone Horse Sl1oal in a northerly directio11, a "Notice to :Mariners" (No. 45) was issued from the office giving directions for avoidiug them. A sl1oal lrn viii g- been reported west-south west of South Shoal light+bip, three separate atteIIlJlU were made to find it, all of which were urnmccesi;ful. This result, together with the testimony of the keeper of the Ii~·ht-ship, that for teu years he had seen vessels of heavy draught passing over the supposed Iocalit~- of the shoal, led Lieiltenant-Cornmander Brownson to the belief that it does not exhit. Tlie report m:1~· have arisen from the fad that in very heavy weatl1er the sea breaks all along from uort ltea:st to soutlrn'l'St of the light ship in from six to eight fathoms. Upon the completion of this work iustrnctions were received to locate a rocky ledge, reported by Lieut. W. '\Y. tlilpatrick, lJ. S. N., as lying off ·warren's Point, R. I. This was doue on the 26th of Septem her. The ledge was found to be of small extent, with a least depth of thirteen feet, dropping off stH1de11ly, i11 lt·ss than a boat's leugth, to four fathoms, an<l to six fathoms only a few yards away. Beariugs and distanees to prominent oujects were taken from the rock, and a ''Notice to Mariners" (No. 411) wai-; prnmptly i!;irned from the ofiice. This rock, known locally a!' Elisha's Ledge, has since lwen buoye1l. The statiHtics of work to the datt' of this examination are given in Lieutenant-Commander Brownsou's report as follows:

During an e11forced absence for about a month of the chief of the party from ill-health, Lieut. F. H. Crosby, L. ::l.

L. ~Whiting to make a resurny of the immediate vicinity of the disaster for the purpose of determining the position of the wreck, the buoys in the vicinity, and the location of as many objects on shore as might ultimately i>erve for a close bydrographic snney. The positions of the WJ'f'ck, of the temporary buoy established Hear it, of the black buoy, and the line of the beach at high water were mai·ked by Mr. Whiting on tlie original topographic sheet, which was transmitted to him for that purpose~ "With regard to that dangerous reef known as the "Devil's Bridge," Mr. Whiting observes that it is a bed of bowW.ers ouly. There is probabls-· no ledge under any part of the island, or near it. These bowlders were probably on the surface of the Tertiary formation of which Gay Head is composed, and as the earthy material ha.s been washed away, the£le bowlders have remained within. the area of the original headland.

From the records for the earlier .Years which were traus1uitted to this office good re,ults were obtained, and more valuable ones may be expected when the complete series is available for discussion. Tidal observations at Block Island.-In .Tanuary, 1884, the series of tidal obser·ations with the self-registeriug tide-gauge established on the breakwater at the eastern end of Block falaud was suddenly brought to a close by the tide-house and gauge lwing crushed by a nsseJ. The rl'cords from this gauge had beeu continuous for nearly a rear and a half. Stuff obseffations were made bJ the observer, Mr. J.M. Couley, for a few days to complete the last half :year. Tltis station had been made the base in the tidal surveys of Buzzard's Bas, Narragansett Bay, arnl Loug bland Sound, and observations may be resumed if found necessary in completing the resurvey of the Sound.

Topograpltic resun·eys of Stonington, Conn., and i:icinity; also of tlte coast of Counecticut in the t1ici11ity <>f Saybrook and Lyme.-Having receh·e<l illstructious to resume the topograpuic resurrny of Stonington, Conn., antl vicinity, Subassistaut 'vV. C. Hodgkins took the field i111mctliately after July 1, 1883. In the course of. the next six weeks the detailed snn·e,y was extended to include the shores of Little Narragansett Bay, lying between Stonington and Watch llill, aud also Wequetecock Cove and the mouth of Pawcatuck Hiver. A<l<litional shore-line was surveyed in Stonington Harbor and in Qttiambaug Co\·e, above tile railroad bridges. The IJorough of Stoningtou and village of Noank were1mrn·~·ed in detail, as also t!Je collection of hotels and depeudeut built.lings at Watch Hill, a popular watering place, locatt>d on a cluster of sharply rouu<led hillocks just at the junction of the long curdug sauu-spit called Nupatree Point. The work in this ·iciuity eml.Jraces portious of the States of Connecticut an<l Rhode Island, the boundary between these two States following the channel of tlm Pawcatuck 1{h·er. By the middle of August the sun·ey in this locality was completed withiu tlie limits assigned, and the party was trausforred to Lyme, Conn., to take up the resurvey of the mouth of tue <..::011necticut Rin·r. E.1st of the Connt-cticut the work e.xteuded along the uorth sl1ore of Loug Jslaud Sound f1 om Four-}Jile River to Blackball Point aud thence north ward to Calves Islund, tlte belt of topograpl1y averaging six hundred meters in width. West of the river, Cornfieltl Point was incluth·d iu the work as well as the shore beyond, with Oyster Ri·er and the iutcrveuing creeks. On the banks of tlte Connecticut itself the shore-line of all creeks and coves was surveyt>d, as far wi they were unobstructed by bridges, the w,ork on the west side of the rh·er extending ai:; far north as Ferry Point. In some cases, owing to the formation of the land, the width of this snn"eyed area was increased beyontl the six lmudred meters adopted a standard. Tbe alluvial marshy islantl8 in the estuary · of the Connecticut were compl<:>tely sun·eyed. Within the limits of the sheet the towns of Lyme and Saybrook were includell. Work was closed for the season November 15. Mr. J. H. Turner, .Acting Aid, joined the p<1rty on August 1 and reu1leretl efficient senice until his <letach111eut early in November. In Atay, 1884, Suua.li8istaut Hodgkius was instructed to resume work on bis topographical sheet of 1883 to complete the survey of Saybrook and Lyme, and the unsurveyed portions of shore· line·.

During the winter of J 883-'84, Mr. Hodgkins was assigned to service which will be referred to under the bead of Section VIII. H,ydrographic resurveys of Fisher's Island Sound, and if.~ adjacent wa,ters continued.- Mention was made in my last annual report of the resumption of the survey of Stonington Harbor by the party in theschooner Palinurus, under the command of Lieut. A. V. \Vadhams, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey. Statistics of the progress made up to June 30, 1883, were then given. During the season ending in November, 18S:J, the hydrograpby of Stonington Harbor was finished, also that of Fisher's Island Sound and Little Narragansett Bay. To obtain a plane of reference for the soundings, a principal tide-station was established at the fish-market wharf in Stoni11g"ton Harbor, and suusidiary stations at the stt'amboat wharf at Watch Hill, in Little Narragansett Bay; at Fox's Wharf, in West Ha· bor, Fi;;her's lslantl, antl at the North Dumpling light house. With the aid of these subsidiary tidal stations a good plane of reference was obtained for all parts of the work. With reference to Stonington Harbor, Lieutenant Wadhams remarks that it is chiefly important as the terminus of the Stonington line of steamers from New York, and as furnishing a safe anchorage for vessels bound to the eastward. It has been greatly improved by the breakwaters lately built, which furnish a complete protection from the ,;outheast gales. Navigators would be much aided in seeking a harbor if bug lights were placed, one on the west end of the eastern breakwater, the other on the east end of the western breakwater. Little Narragansett Bay, Lieutenant Wadhams states, is full of shoals and unimportant for commercial purposes, except as furni8hiug a means of commnuicatiou with Westerly, R. I., on the Pawcatuck River. For this purpose a channel bas bePn dredged on the east side of tlie bay to the mouth of the river. Tliree stations were occupied during the progress of the survey for observations of currents, one at the eastern entrance of Fisher's Island Sound, off Watch Hill Point, one on board the Eel Grass light-ship, and one at the western entrance of the sound north of Dumpling light. At each of these stations observations were continued during one flood and one ebb tide. Lieutenant Wadhams expr~sses himself as under obligations to· the Hon. Richard A. Wheeler, of Stonington, for information furnished in regard to the names or islands, coves, &c. Among the most important results of the work was the development of several dangerous ledges in Fisher's Island :Sound; the first off Napatree Point, the second to the northeast of Seal Rocks, and the tliird north of the Middle Clump. '!'lie least tlepthson thl·se ledges were found to be fifteen, thirteen, and seventeen feet, respectively.

John T. Sullivan, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Endc·avor, comprised the resurvey of the eastern part of Long Island Sound from Race Rock to Inlet Point, and thence to Old Lauding, Long Island, and additional soundings in Block Island Sound from Phelps' Ledge to Southwest Ledge. The inshore hydrograpby included the islands in the Race and the north shore of Long Island withiu the limit named. Connecting with this work, lines of soundings were run across the sound at inten·als ranging from a quarter of a mile to a mile, far enough in to connect with the inshore work of other parties. At the outset of the season, in July, 1883, tide-gauges were established at Little Gull Island, off Truman's Beach, Long Island, and in the vicinity of Nattitnck Inlet, Long Island. .Much difti. culty was experienced in maintaining the two gauges last named on acoount of the exposed ooar-

acter of the Long Island shore and the prevalence of northerly winds. The plane of mean low water as established by the abo\·e gauges is practically that at New London. Valiant Shoal and Rock in "The Race" were fully developed, and the search for Constellation Rock to the southward of Great Gull Island resulted successfully. Breese l{ock, reported as I.ring about half a mile south of Constellation Rock, could not be found. Lieutenant Sullivan's work is complete as far westward as the meridian passing clear of Goose Island, to the westward of Falkner's Island. It is plotted on three hydrographic sbeets and one tracing; the former on scales of 1-20000 and 1-40000, embracing the surveys in Long Island Sound; the latter, on a scale of 1-40000, shows the soundings made in Block Island Sou11d.

Hydrographic work off Shagwong Point, Montauk ; resurvey of Black Rock Harbor, Conn. ; examination11 for rocks and ledges in East River, N. Y.-Thc:> hydrograpby exc:>cnted lly the party in the steamer Blake, under the command of Lieut. Commander W. H. Brownson, U. S. N., Assist· ant 0'.">ast and Geodetic Survey, during the first three months of the fiscal year, bas been referred t-0 under the heading of Section I. Towards the close of September, after completing his work at Warren's Point, R. I., Lieutenant-Commander Brownson was instructed to place a buoy and sinker on a pinnacle rock off Shag· wong Point, Montauk. This rock bad been located by Assistant Gershom Bradford. The depth of water on the pinnacle having been accurately ascertained, the obstruction buoy was placed near the rock. On the 6th of October, the Blake proceeded to Black Rock, Conn., where a hydrographic resurvey of the harbor was begun, the. work being carried well up the small entrances so as to give sufficient data for determining whether certain proposed improvements were practicable or desirable. Being favored with fine weather, the survey was pushed rapidly, and finished on the 12th of October. Information having been received from Mr. John Lockwood, Hell Gate pilot, of the exiRtence of shoal water in the Ea.st River, N. Y., in the vicinity of Hiker's Island, Lieutenant-Uommamler Brownson was directed to make an ex~mination of that. locality. He found a shoal of small extent, having eighteen feet upon it at low water, iu the middle of the channel between Hiker's Isla.ml and Legget's Point; also another rock with but seventeen feet o\·er it in the bight between Port Morris and Legget's Point· .Navigators were promptly warned of these dangers in "Notice to Mariners No. 42, '' the bearings of each shoal spot to prominent ol>jects being given. As already stated in noticing the earlier work of the season, the officers attached to the party were Lieut. F. H. Crosby, U.S. N. Assistant, and Ensigns J. T. Newton, H. S. Knapp, E.

During the summer and autumn, topographic resurveys were made of Montauk Point, and of Shelt<'r, Gardim·r\1, Plum~ and Gull fala1Hls. Also of Ol'ient Harbor mid Yicinity. Hydrogrnphic "Work was done in the northern part of Shelter Island Sound, and in Long Island Sound, to the north of 1\fo11tank Point.

Tb is gauge was established on account of its utility in the resurvey of Long Island Sound; it will y-it·ld also improYed data for use hereafter in predicting the tides, New London having been selected as one of the principal 11orts to which the tides of neighboring ports are referred in the tiJe tables published annually by this office. Topographic resurveys 1f the north shore of Long Island Sound, betu:een New Lond-01i and Four.

Dennis, in July, 1883, took up the detailed topography upon the sheet of New Lon<lon and vicinity, the shore-line and part of the details upon which had heeu done during tbe previous season. Mr. De1111is completed a margin of topography upwards of four hnnd.red meters in width upon this sheet, and then began work upon the next sl1eet westward, which included the shores of Niautic Bay and. Four-Mile RiYer. Having carrie<l the topography upon this sheet from one-fourth to one.half a mile inward, and finished it September 25, the party was moved to Cliuton and work begun from Sa;ybrook westward.

Hydrf1graphic resurrey along the north shore of Lon,q Island Sound betireen Goshe1i Point and Hanimona8sett Point.-Ha,·ing organizl·d l1ii,; h,\·drogrnpl1ic part,Y on board the li'clioonPr Silliman, Lieut. John D. Keeln, U.S. N., Assistant Coast mid Geodt·tic SmVt',Y, left ~ew York aml arri\·ed at New Loudon, Conn., early in Jul~-, 1883. T11e work intmsted to liiR charge was a hj«lrogTapbic resurvey of the shoal water Rlo11g the north 8hore of Long hlaml 801111<1, begi111iini:r at Goshen Point, one-half mile west of New Loudon Light, aud extendiug to Harumonussett Point at the western entrance of Clinton (or Killi11gworth) Harbor. At the outset of operatio11s an arrangement was made with Lii:ut. John T. Sulli,·an, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Smw\y, comrnaucling tlie steamer Emlt'arnr, with regard to tl1e limits of work to be done by each party, Lieuteuaut Sullinm's liues of souudiugs across the Sound being carried far <·nouglt in to connect with the inshore work. 'l'ide-ganges were established at l\lillstone Point, Fenwick ·wharf, and, as tbe work progressed, at Duck 1:slaml Hlll'oor, the last-named gauge beillg ol.nse1 n'd for refereuce ouly, while tlrn ouservatious at the two first-uamed ones were continuous for at least a lunar month. The several reefs and shoals h1elu<led withiu tl1e limits of the survi:y wne tboroughl~- examined . .Among them were Bartlett's Reet; Two Tree lslaml Shoal, the small shoal off Hatch1·tt's Point, the shoals off the mouth of the Connecticut River, Long Sand Shoal, the shoal off Cornfield Point, the Hen r111d Chickens, anll Crane Reef. · On Bartlett's Reef no 11ew <langl'rs were discowre<l, but a gronp of rocks just to the eastward of it, known locally as "The Triangle," or "Tiiangle Rocks," was snccessfully searched for and located. While working to the southwest of Black Point, a shoal souuding was taken in four fathoms; this locality was afterwards; examined, but uothing sl.Jonler than this 'llas de\·eJ011ed. The extensi\·e slloals off the mouth of the Connecticut RiHr were denloped with great care. Lieutenant Keeler can ... attention to the fact that these t"11oals are cbanging the charactt'r of their surface constantly, and almost with e\'ery shift of win<l; certainly so wlten the wind ulows with violence. With regard to the Connecticut Hiver, be obser\""es that the usual entrance throug-h the jetties can be usetl in almost any weather, bnt that after Jlassing Saybrook lig·ht there is nothing to mark the channel, which is quite narrow, although the rh'er is wide. On the em;tern side of the cbaunel there are several sunken stone piers~ covered at half tide, and the strong curreut running makes it difficult for a 1:1tranger to proceed up the rh'er with confidence. Lieutt·nant Keeler recommends that the channel be buored. With bis report lie lias suhmitted a tabular statenwut of the number of vessels of all kinds passing in and out of the Connecticut from September 8 to 30, iuclusive. The whole number is four hundred and twenty-nine, an average of about niut>teen a day. While surYe~·iug Westbrook Harbor two rocks werl.' disco,·ered which lnul not been marked on the charts; their positions were carefully determined by hearings and otherwise. Lieutenant Reeler's report, of which an austract 0111,Y is !Jere gfreu, is exct>ediu~Jy full and complete in its detaile<l statements re!lpecting the localities included iu 11is survey. He expresRes Lis gratification with the spirit manifested hy the officers wlio asi<islf'd him in conducting the work. These were Ensigus F. H. Sherman, C. W. Jungen, and T. C. Dewey, U.S. N.

During the winter the Silliman was laid up in New York, iu charge of Ensign Sherman. Information having been received at this office from the Uhl Colons Steamboat Compau~- of the existence of a dangerous rock iu East River, Ensign Sherman was dir('cted to examine the locality. He found a. pinnacle rock not over four ~·ards sqirnre, arnl situateJ one lrnuclred and lift~ j·ard,.; outside of Nes Rock, and ou the prolongation of Twentieth street, New York City. Tlie lt:>ast water fountl O\"er the rock was twelve and a half feet. A ''Notice to .Mariners" (No. 48), gidng exact looation a.nil bearings, was immediately publiehed, and information having been furnished to the

Light-House Board, they caused a danger buoy to be placed on the rock May 28. This buoy may be passed on either hand. In the search for the rock Ensign Sherman bad the aid of Ensign W. 0. Canfield, U.S. N. Topo_qraphic ri;surv&y of the north shore of Long Island Soiind from Bridgeport to Farms (or Frost's) Point.-Assistant E. Hergesheilller, nuder instructious issued in June, 1883, reached the field July 1, and began a topographic resurvey of the north shore of Long Island Sound from Bridgeport westward to l?arms (or Fro'lt's) Point. Between these limits the belt of topography surveyed extended on the average seven-eighths of a mile from the coast. The topographic sheet included the city of Bridgeport, the solid interior of which was compiled from the records of the city survey department, furnished by H. G. Scofield, city engineer. Field operations closed October 25. The exceedingly skillful and artistic delineation of details · of topography and lettering on the field sheet, as brought out distinctly in the inkin~, led to its reproduction by the photolithographic process without reduction from the original scale of survey (1-10000), and with marked success.

Re-estttblishment of points of the old triangulation and derermination of additionttl points on the south shore of Long Island Sound, between Horton's Point and Oul P.ield Point.-In order to furnish points for the resurvey of Long lsland Sound, Assistant S. 0. McCorkle was specially charged with the recovery of the old stations between Horton's Point and Old Fields Point on the north coast of Long Island, and with the determination of such additional points as might amply suffice for the uses of the topographic and hyrlrographic surveys. In pursuance of this duty, after having selected as a base the line Osborn-Shinnecock, Mr. Mccorkle was fortunate in identifying seven stations of the former triangulation. His reconnaissance and subsequent occupation of stations in the scheme laid out, between the limits . just referred to, pro\'ided all the points needed in the progress of the survey on that coast. His report states in detail the characteristics of the country passed over. 'rl1e statistics of the work, which closed November 30, are as follows:

U was deemed desirable to mark permanently the station on Shinnecock Hills, and, in accordance with arraugements made to that effect with Mr. Austin Corbin, the owner of the land on which the station is located, Assistant Mccorkle, in May, 1884, placed a granite pillar over the iron cone beneath the surface which bad been secured in position as an underground mark by Assistant J·. A. Sullivan in 1874. The surface marks placed by Assistant F. H. Gerdes in 1879 were found to be in good order. Supplementary triangulation between. Eaton's Point and Sands' Point, n-0rtk CM8t of Long Island, and of the opposite shore, for the resurvey of Long Island Sovnd.-The duty of executing the supplementary triangulation of the shores of Long Island Sound, from Eaton's Point to Sands' Point and opposite, was committed to Assistant Gershom Bradford by instructions issued early in August, 1883. Having organized his party, and established his headquarters at Northport, L. I., as a central point, Mr. Bradford pushed the triangulation acrol.!S the Sound to the westward from the lines Eaton's Point-Copp's Island, and Eaton's Point-Cbimon's Island. At the close of the season, December 13, the triangulation finished included the country abont Hnntingt.on Bay and Northport Bay, reaching westward on the Long Island shore to Oak lfeek

Point and to stations on the Connecticut sb~re; these in turn connecting with the triangulation of Mr. Bradford's previous season in Connecticut. During the winter Mr. Bradford was engaged in office-work pertaining to his field operations, and in a special investigation relating to the several methods of reading the mariner's compass. On this subject he made a detailed report. Towards the end of May he was directed to resume the triangulation of J,ong Island Sound, and to connect it with the original primary Rtations Bald Hill and Round Bill. Pro\"isional stations had been established near those points by Mr. Bradford iu 1882, but as the work pro. gressed it became desirable to refer it to the original line. By applying azimuth:,; and distances from the approximate positions of 1882, the station marks left hy Assistant Edmund Blunt in 1866 were recovered with but little digging. The old station, Eaton, on Eaton's Neck, waE! recovered also. At the close of the fiscal year 1883-1884 the triangulation was in actiYe progress.

Completion of the primary triangulation across the State of New I"ork for connecting the trfongulation of the Hudson River and Lake Champlain with that of the survey of the Great Lakes.-At the beginning of the fiscal year, as mentioned in my last annual report, the party of Assh;tant Charles 0. Boutelle was about to occupy Howlett Station, about !I miles west ot' Syraculi'e, a poiut identical with the State survey station of that name, and one of the last in the scheme for connecting the survey of Hudson Rfrer and Lake Champlain with that of the Great Lakes by a primary triangulation across the State of New York. Early in July, 1883, the observing tripocl and scaffold of tbe State survey at Howlett wais rebuilt and occupied at an elevation of about 50 feet for the measurement of horizonta·l directions. Tbe usual observations for latitude and azimuth were made by Mr. J. B. Boutelle, extra obser\·er, and Prof. L. L. Barnard, of State College, Pennsylvania, who wai:! temporarily attached as Acting Assistant to the party. Local time was determined by Subassistant J. B. Baylor, who also made the observations for magnetic declination and intensity. Twenty.inch theodolite No. 113 was used for the measurements of horizontal directions. Twenty-four pairs of stars were observed for latitude with zenith telescope No. 5. For local time the new prismatic transit was used for the first time in the field. Assistant Boutelle reports favor· ably upon this instrument as both accurate and exceedingly convenient for field obserrntions. At this station, as at all others of the primary chain, vertical angles were carefully observed. Upon the close of observations at Howlett's station, Professor Barnard was detached from the party, and Subassistant Baylor was directed M> occupy the station of the Lake t;uffey, Clyde, in Wayne County, for the determination of horizontal directions, vertical angles, aud magnetic declination and intensity. ·while this work was in progress, Assistant Boutelle proceeded to Oswego to occupy the Lake Survey station of that name in the southwestern part of the city. A tripod one hundred and nine feet high had been built here by the United States Engineers in 1874. Finding it much decayed, repairs wefe about to be hegun, when by a furious gale which swept oYer Lake Ontario, the whole structure was blown to the ground. A new ohserYing tripod aud scaffold, forty-six feet high, was at once begun, and finished in five days, being in readiness for occupation October 1. Subassistant Baylor was at this date detached from the party. Observations of horizontal and vertical augltIB were finished October 16. A double line of levels was run from the Lake Survey station "Oswego" to their bench-mark close to the shore of Lake Ontario. This bench-mark had been previously connected by the .Lake Survey parties with the Uoast and Geodetic S11rvey bench-mark at Greenbush on the Hudson, opposite Albany, by a double line of levels. The Lake Survey station" Victory," about seventeen miles in a southwesterly direction from Oswego, was next occupied. The tripod originally built at the station was found to be in good older, and tbe twenty-inch theodolite was mounted upon it October 18, with the telescope at an elevation of ov-er ninety feet. The observations of horizontal and vertical angles at this station

3.2

were made by !Ir. J.B. Boutelle, and upon their completion, October 30, field operations were closed for the Remmn. In or1 1 er to establish a thorough connection between the Coast and Geodetic Survey and Lake Survey systems of triangnlation, M:r. J. B. Boutelle was instructed to proceed to Mannsville, N. Y., in May, 1.38!, and nuder the direction of Assistant Boutelle, to occupy the Lake Survey station of that name for the purpose of measuring the angles between stations Loomis, Oswego, and North base. By these observations a direct connection wa"! obtained with the Sandy Creek base of the Lake Sur~ey. This work, including a determination of the magnetic declination and intensity, was completed on tlle 18th of June . .A report upon the rPsults of .Assistant Boutelle's triangulation across the State of New York, and its connection with the triangulation of the Lake Snrvey will be found in Appendix No. 9. These results \'erify the indications referred to in my last annual report as derived from the pre- · liminary computations, and show that a close and satisfactory agreement Las been reached at the junction of the two systems of triangulation, "an agreement which· is the more satisfactory, since each system is an allsolntely independent work, starting from bases widely separated on the Atlantic coast and on the Great r,akes, and carried on by independent methods, instruments, and observers." After elosiog work at 1\fanns,·ille, Mr. J. B. Boutelle was directed to visit Kingston, Canada, to make inquir.v respecting the possillle use of an astronomical station in the grounds of Queen's College an(l U11h·er:o;ity as the north end of the Pamplico arc of the meridian. This service, as well as other dnty alreacly referred to m11ler the bead of Section I, was executed with skill and diligence. Mr. Bontelltl's rrport has bet'n transmitted to the office. Hyriroyraphic resurrey of tlie approaclteH f!J New York.-In accordance with instructions issued in .Tuue, 1.1{83, J,ieut. H. B. l\fansfield, U. S. N., As.sist.1.nt Coast and Geodetic Survey, organized a hsdrographic party on the ste;imer .A. D. Bacihe for the resurv<>y of the approaches to New York . .About tile l;3th of .Jul.Y, all prepara~ions Laving been completed, the work was begun. As far south as latitrnle 40° 12' north, and as far east as longitude 73° 2J' west from Greenwich, lines were run from both the :N"··w Jersey and the Long Island shores a quarter of a mile apart to the five fathom ctu\·e; a half a mile apart to the ten fathom curve, and to the limits of the sheet, the curves of fifteen and twenty fatuoms, a mile ap:ut. Additional lines were run normal to the New Jersey coast and two miles apart as far south as the head of Barnegat Bay to connect this work with that of Lieutenant-Uomma111ler Brownson in the steamer Blake. The weather upon the whole was not fa·oraule for offshore work, but by taking advantage of ever.}' favorable opportunity, the rcsiuvey was completed October 11. Close liu('s of som11lings W(:lre run over the locality known as the "Cholera Bank," but no depths were found of less than ten to eleven fathoms. Lientenaut l\fansficld olmervel.i that the most interesting result of the resurvey appears to be the devel(>pme11t of the so Mlle1l "holes'' iu the approaches to New York entrance into a clearlydefiue1l g11llJ, e;isily tmcell from the outer limit of the work to the \'iciuity of the Su.udy Hook ligbtvessel. There are great 1liffere11ces in deptlis of water in this gull~-, but its bottom in every part consists of hlue clay au1l fine sand, chara.cterh;tic:-1 fonntl nowhere else within the limits of the survey, tlrns reducing all sailing directions for the ligltt-vessel in thick or foggy weather to the simple use of the armt-Al lead . .All soumlings were referred to the datum plane of the permanent tiile-gauge at Sandy Hook. Ackuowledgmeut is mtide by Lieutenant !fansfield of the cheerful as:sistauce rendered in the work aud the good j111lgment shown in its conduct by the officers attached to the Bache-Ensigns W. B.

Observations of currents and other hydrographic work off New York entran~e.-The work assigned to Lieut. J.C. Fremont, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, by instructions dated early in July, 1883, was to make observations for currents at stations near the one hundred fathom curve between Montauk Point and Cape May, and upon the completion of these observations to take up the examination of certain localities of shoal soundings off New York entrance. Having organized his party on board the schooner Drift, Lieutenant Fremont left New York July 16, and after having occupied ten current stations returned to New York October 10. All along the one hundred fathom curve the same currents were found, the current swinging the vessel with the sun with great regularity. To this regular swinging with the sun the exceptions were at stations 9 and 10, near to or in the gully leading out of New York Harbor. At both of these stations the observations showed the current to run alternately about northwest and southeast. There was also an absence of the usual tide rips. The remainder of the season was occupied in soundings off Sandy Hook, off the New Jersey coast, and in Gedney's Channel, New York entrance. Special examinations were made in and around the Oil Spot, the outer Middle Ground, and around the obstruction buoy which is over the eighteen-foot spot between the whistling buoy and the second mid-channel buoy of the South Channel; also around buoy No. 3 7 and the second mid-channel buoy of Gedney's Channel. Lieutenant Fremont had the aid of Ensigns A. F. Fechteler, F. W. Kellogg, and F. R. Brainard; U.S. N. · The Drift returned to port November 17, and during the winter was fitted for a. cruise in the Gulf Stream. Reference will be made to Lieutenant Fremont's observations of currents of the east coast of Florida under the head of Section VI. Oontinuatwn of series of tidal observations witk self-registering tide-gauge at Sandy Hook, N. J.For the last two years the self-registering tide-gauge at Sa.ndy Hook, N. J., has been in charge of F. W. Shepheard. The gauge is now located close beside the station office of the New Jersey Southern Railroad, at the north end of the bight known as'' The Horseshoe" in Sandy Hook Bay. 8ome interruption of the observations has occurred during the year by reason of extensive repairs that have been made to the wharf, and in the winter by the ice which is forced across the bay and congeals in thick masses near the fl.oat. box. New piles have been driven and heavy braces arranged about the fl.oat-box so that hereafter it will be better protected. There is ample depth of water at the gauge. Triangul,ation of the northern part of the Stat.e of N e1ti J ersc.lf continued, and reconnaissance begun for the extensi-On of the triangulation in the southern part.-Geodetic operations in the State of New Jersey have been continued as heretofore by Prof. E. A. Bowser, Acting Assistant. Field-work was begun June 1, 1883, by the occupation of station High Mount, about 5 miles north of Paterson, Passaic County. Signals were erected at Mount Horeb, Mount Olive, Bald Hill, Bear Fort, High Torne, Weasel, and Buttermilk Hill; at the two latter stations in order to form a direct connecti~n between the New Jersey triangulation and the primary triangulation of the coast. At Mount Horeb, 35 miles southwesterly from High Mount, a heliotroper was estab· lished. Observations were completed at Mount Horeb August 11, and the party was then moved to station High Torne, near Ramapo, in Rockland Oounty, N. Y. The signals Bald Hill, Bear Fort, Buttermilk Hill, and Weasel were readjusted, and a signal erected at High Mount. A vista was opened through the woods on Uamapo Mount, two miles east of High Torne, to render visible the station on Buttermilk Hill. Work at High Torne having been finished October 4, Professor Bowser made preparations for resuming the reconnaissance in the southern part of the State. Five stations had been selected before the beginning of .the fiscal year, starting with the line RidgewayApplepie HilL Continuing the exploration of the country to the l'IOuthward and westward, four additional stations were selected, though not without much difficulty, the country being tlat and thickly wooded. What seemed like a .ridge would not unfrequently be found to be, on a. nearer inspection, a low swamp with veey tall trees, while, on the other hand, the trees on some of the

ridges were so low that their tops were not visible from the station of reconnaissance. At many of the points scaffolds and tripods of forty feet in height will be needed. Field operations were closed November 3. In the spring of 1884 Professor Bowser was authorized to resume the reconnaissance, carrying it west and southwest from Williamstown, Gloucester County. · Continvation of the triangul,ation and reeonnaissance of the State of Pennsylvania.-Geodetic operations in the State of Pennsylvania were resumed by Prof. Mansfield Merriman, Acting Assistant, early in July, 1883. Three stations were occupied during the season for the continuation of the triangulation to the southward and westward. From Gov. Dick, the first station occupied, about six miles south of Lebanon, Lebanon County, observations were made upon eight stations, at six of which heliotropers were posted. On July 30, the work at Gov. Dick having been completed, Professor Merriman occupied a station at Wintersoown, York County. From this point four stations were observed, and the work was finished August 7, when the party proceeded to Round Top, a station about eleven miles in a southerly direction from Harrisburg. With the occupation of Round Top, from which five other points were observed, the measurements of horizontal angles closed, and during the remainder of the season Professor Merriman visited other stations in the scheme to the westward, for the purpose of selecting positions nearly enough approximate to facilitate the final selection during the next year.

Survey of the boundary line between the States of Pennsylvania and West Virg·inia.-Mention was made in my last annual report of the detail of Subassistant 0. H. Sinclair to exeeut.e the work of tracing out the boundary lines between Pennsylvania and West Virginia, in compliance with a request from the Joint Commission of those two States. Snbassistant 0. H. Van Orden was instructed to report for duty to Mr. Sinclair. An understanding having been arrived at with the Joint Commissioners as to the most desirable mode of tracing and marking the meridian boundary line, the work was begun at S~ith's Ferry, Beaver County, Pa., by measuring an azimuth and passing a meridian through the apex of the large granite monument that marks the south end of the boundary line between the States of Pennsylvania and Ohio. The observations for azimuth and time were made with the ten-inch repeating theodolite No. 82, arrd recorded by means of a Parkinson and Frodsham sidereal chronometer. The diaphragm of this theodolite had been fitted with three vertical wires; its horizontal axis was perforated and provided with a lamp and mirror f6r illuminating the threads; these, with a vertical circle and diagonal eye-piece comprised the set of attachments which were removable at pleasure. This instrument was used also for ranging out the line. A 6-ineh Brunner theodolite provided with telemeter wires and a vertical arc; a graduated rod, chain, and pins, a steel tape, two pocket heliotropes for ranging in points at long distances, and the necessary field-glasses completed the instrumental outfit of the party. Mr. Sinclair's plan of operations was to secure as long lines of sight with the large theodolite 11.s possible; to clear the line of all obstructions and locate points on the prominent hills for the use of the second party under Mr. Van Orden, who, with the 6-inch theodolite, located all the old boundary-line marks, measured the length of the line, and established in position points for the new monuments. On account of the broken character of the country, the first plan of chaining the line for distance was abandoned, and a series of small triangnlations was carried on from short measured bases, this method giving the lengths required with expedition and accuracy. At the distance of eleven miles from the initial point, as the meridian was found to diverge from the old line-stones, a check azimuth was measured and the meridian found practicalJy perfect. Beyond this point a series of long sights was secured, ranging from three to eleven miles, and at

a. point fifty-three miles and seven-tenths from the initial point another azimuth was measured, the line being found accurate as at the preceding test. From this point to the southwest corner of Pennsylvania the distance was only ten miles, and waa traversed in three sights. The deviation of the line, as marked by tlie old line-marks, from the meridian line traced south from the Ohio and Pennsylvania granite monument, was rather regular to the west, and at the southwest corner of Pennsylvania it amounted to fifty-four feet and five and a half inches. .As soon as the line had been measured and the pOllitions of the old line marks located with r~pect to the meridian, the Joint CommiRsioners, at a meeting held July 3, adopted for the boundary a straight line through the southwest corner of Pennsylvania and the first stone south of the Ohio, placed in the meridian of the granite monument on the Ohio and Pennsylvania boundary. Twenty-four of the old line stones were found, twenty of which were deemed authentic. From these the old line was reproduced, and it was found that the new boundary would .cause a loss of but ten amt four-tenths acres to West Virginia. This boundary it was decided to have marked with large sandstone monuments. For the longitude of Smith's Ferry, signals were exchanged on two nights in July with the longitude party at Louisville, Ky. Additional exchanges could not be obtained owing to the gen eral strike of the relegraph operators which began July 19. Latitude was derermined with the zenith telescope by sixty observations. The position of the longitude station was carefully marked~ and connected with that of the boundary monument by the measurement of a base a~d a small scheme of triangulation. In the following month, with my approval, Mr. Sinclair was authorized by the Joint Commissioners to trace out a portion of the boundary between Pennsylvania and West Virginia running eastward from the southwest corner of Pennsylvania along the parailel of 390 43'.3, nearly. This bound.ary to the Maryland corner is about fifty-five miles in length. This distance Mr. Sinclair divided into four sections by five latitude stations, each located near some authentic mark on the old line. At each station latitude was observed with zenith telescope No. 6 on twenty-three pairs of stars on three night8, except at the initial point, the southwest corner of Pennsylvania, where observations were o9tained on four nights. These observations having been completed and the field computations made, the party assembled a.t the init\al station September 26, to begin tracing the parallel boundary. The method employed was to observe an azimuth, Jay off an angle of ninety degrees from the meridian, and range out a tangent in the prime vertical of the initial point as a liI,ie of reference for the old ooundary marks and for the positions of the new monuments. Three sections of the parallel oounda.ry were thus traced out for a total distance of thirty-five miles and eight-tenthe, when it became necessary to suspend operations for the season. In the first twenty-one miles from the initial point towards the east there were five wen. authenticated line marks, and the boundary, as reproduced from these, very nearly coincided with the theoretical parallel through the southwest comer of Pennsylvania (supposing the spheroid uniform). The work of Ma.son and Dixon in 1767 terminated about twenty -one and a half miles east of the initial point. Upon reaching their boundary, the line was found to bend to the south with moderate uniformity for nearly ten miles, where it has a maximum deftection of one hundred and seventyfonr and a ha.If feet south of the theoretical curve through the southwest corner. East of this, and for a di.stance of nearly tlve miles, the boundary turns northward and is nearly a. true parallel. Mason and Dixon's marks ~ere large mounds six to eight feet in diameter, and most of them about six inches high. For twenty-one miles from the initial point towards the east the old line marks were old posts' or post-holes in heaps of stones. Twenty-one miles of the parallel boun4ary were ready for marking in November, 1883, but the rest of it cannot be marked until the survey has been completed to the Maryland corner, a distance of a.bout nineteen miles. The meridian boundary was permanently marked during July and August 1883, and the meridian itself preserved by extra monuments. Sabassista.nt Sinclair acknowledges the very efticient a.id rendered to the work by Bubassista.nt V ~ Orden, who had charge of the second party and made the map of the two boundary lines.

Topographic survey of the New Jersey coast from Oape May Court-Home nortltward.-Under instructions issued at the beginning of the fiscal year Assistant Charles .M. Bache resumed the topographic surrny of the coast of New Jersey in the vicinity of Cape .May Court-House. A new barge was· being constructed for the mm of his party, and while awaiting its arrival Mr. Bache was occupied in locating 011 a former topographic sheet a newly-built railroad running from the Cape May Branch of the West Jersey Railroad to Anglesea, a seaside resort lately established on Five.Mile Beach, near Hereford Inlet. Time was utilized also in tearing away such parts of the old barge as could be made serviceable for the new one. On the 14th of August, the new barge having arrived and certain needful additions having been made, the party proceeded to the locality of work, and by the middle of October, when field-work was closed, had carried the topography from Cape May Court-House northward to Learning's Sound and towards the coast at Learning's Beach and Townsend's Inlet. High winds were very prevalent during the season, retarding the plane-table work. Mr. W. B. Mapes served in the party as acting aid from September 1 to the close of the season.

Physical hydrography of Delaware River and Bay, and 1-0cation ofport-warden lines in the harbor of

Philadelphia.-The attention of Assistant Henry Mitchell has been i,;pecifically directed during the past year to the study of the physical hydrography of Delaware Bay and River, although duties pertaining to membership in the Mississippi River Commission, and in other boards where he represents this Survey, have also occupied much of his time. A great amount of data for his studies of the Delaware River and Bay have been furnished by the recent surveys, and in a carefully prepared article. published as Appendix No. 8 to my report for 1883, he discussed the laws of variation in sectional area, mean depth, mean channel depth, &c., in that portion of the stream which has been designated as "The Estuary," lying between the city _of Philadelphia and the head of the submerged delta, fifty miles below. He has since submitted a paper iu which he reviews a progress report by Assistant B. L. Harin. din, who is engaged upon a comparison of the new h_ydrographic surveys with thoseexecute.d forty years ago. Mr. Mitchell's paper (not designed for publication) is a prospectus of the new study, foreshadowing probable result.a, and justifying the great expenditure of labor required. The progress report of Mr. Marin din, to which reference bas just been ma.de, is published 38 Appendix No. 12 to this report. · It discusses the changes in the Delaware between Old Man's Point and Deep Wat;er Point, including Oberry Island Flats, and in the bay between Beedy Island and Liston's Point. Mr. Marindin was directed to take up the comparison of these disoonnooted localities becanae of tho

opportunity afforded of studying the effect of artificial changes by dredging in the channel to the west of Cherry Island Flats, and becautie the vicinity of Reedy Island is generally accepted as the head of Delaware Bay, and as the future locality of an ice-harbor. With regard to Cherry Island Flats, Mr. Mitchell remarks that they are not only growing, but traveling. That the movement of the center of graYitJ' is down stream and towards the concave (right) banks, probably in the direction of a small resultant of flood and ebb streams; and that the observations to be made t-0 explain the existence of this bank, its growth, and its movement, so as to predict its future, would consist of current measurements in a cordon of stations during the dry sea.son, and a gauging of the river discharges in the wet season. An inference of value drawn by Mr. l\farindin from his i1ffestigations in the same locality is that of the two rival channels around the Flats, the eastern channel would have been the better one for improvement by dredging, the comparisons showing that without any aid outside of natural forces the eastern channel has gained in depth since 1841, notwith8tauding the adver80 conditions of opening a rival channel by the removal of a million and a half cubic yards of material. Mr. Marindiu's assignment to duty as consulting engineer of the United States Advisory Commission on port-warden lines for the port of Philadelphia occupied him during the first half of the fiscal year. ln December he returned to the suboffice in Boston, and has since been engaged continually in the party of Assistant Mitchell, in comparisons of the Delaware Rfrer hydrographic surveys. Mr. J. A. SnlliYan was attached to the party during the year, and has made, under Mr. Mitchell's direction, a number of investigations requiring the most critical study and careful labor. Topographic resun,ey of the New Jersey shore of DelmMre Bay continued.-Early in July, 1883, Assistant R. M. Bache organized bis party for the continuation of the topographical resurvey of the New Jersey shore of Delaware Bay. His first work was to finish a topographic sheet begun the previous season, and extending from Elsingborough Point to Jacob's Creek, in the vicinity of Greenwich, N'. J. Then, under instructions, he went to Cape May Point, and beginning the planetable survey there, worked up the shore of the bay to the mouth of Goshen Creek, where, on the 15th of November, field operations were brought to a close. Thiti part. of the work is comprised in two topographic sheets, one from Cape l\Iay Point to the Hummocks (finished), and one from the Hummocks to Goshen Creek (unfinished). The seale of these sheets, as of the one previously referred to, was 1-20000. Mr. Bache observes in his report that the mapped margin back of high-water line varies from a quarter of a. mile to a mile in width, depending upon the configuration of the country, no attempt being made t-0 go back beyond what clearly shows on the one hand the relation of the space delineated to the bay, and on the other hand to tµe back country; no arbitrary line, where there is no natural bounuary, being able to.give to a topographical margin the true suggestive significance of the eonntry beyond.

During the winter Assistant Bache inked, lettered, and sent to the office two topographic sheets of his survey, and towards the close of the fiscal year prepared to take the field at as early a date as the state of the appropriation would permit. Oontinuation of tke topograpliic resurvey of the western sh.ore of Dela1Care Bay.-Assistant C. T. Iardella took the field for the continuation of tlie topographic resurvey of the weRteru shore of Delaware Bay about the beginning 9f July, 1883. The two topographic sheets which he completed, on a scale of 1-20000, included a margin of topography varying from half a mile to a mile and a half in width along the shore of the bay between ~om bay Hook light and Clark's Station (2), about three and a half miles north of Mispillion Creek light-house. Comparisons with the survey of 1845 showed marked changes in the shore line, many of the old triangulation marks having been washed

away.

.

Mr. Iardella has made note of some of the leading features of the creeks surveyed in the progress of the work1 as follows:

38

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY.

''Leipsic Creek is one hundred and eighty meters wide at its entrance. Bold water can be carried to the depth of ten feet at high tide as far as Leipsic village. The survey of 1845 connected Leipsic Creek with Olli Duck Creek and Dona Creek, forming an island called Little Bombay Hook. This island has entirely disappeared, there being now nothing but marsh between Leipsic and Dona Creek11, "Dona Oreek is one hundred and twenty-three meters wide at its mouth. Bold water can be carried from the entrance to Dona Landing to the depth of from ten to fifteen feet. Vessels drawing six feet can enter at high tide; at low tide there is shoal water. "Mahon's Ditch entrance is one hundred and fifty meters wide. Great changes have taken place in this locality within the past few years; the shore on each side of the creek has been washed away, so that the light-house is nearer the bay by forty meters than it was when first built. High spring tides surround it for about a quarter of a mile to the westward. "Little Creek is sixty meti:irs wide at its mouth and forty-five meters in width from its mouth to Little Creek Landing, distant in a straight line about four miles, but by the creek, which is very crooked, about nine miles. To the landing there can be carried some fifteen feet of water. "Jones's Creek is one hundred meters wide at its entrance. Large vessels drawing seven feet can go as far as Bartlam's Landing. It is navigable for small boats from said landing to Dover." Field-work was closed November 13.

Hydrographic t·esurt'ey of Delatcare Bay from Mahon's River to Mispillion Creek light.-In pursuance of instructions issued about the beginning of the fiscal year, Lieut. C. McR. Winslow, U. S. N., .Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the schooner Ready, organized a hydrographic party for continuing the resurvey of Delaware Bay. The working ground extended from Mabon's River light to Mispillion Creek light, on the western shore of Delaware Bay, and lines of soundings were run normal to the direction of the bay and shoa1"1, and extended a-0ross the Joe Flogger Shoal t-0 the main ship-channel. .A sufficient number of cross-lines were run to verify the soundings. On the flats between Mahon's River and Murderkill Creek, to westward of the deep holes and channels, the lines of soundings were run at a greater distance apart, as the bottom in this portion of the survey is very regular. Oysters are planted all over these flats. The shoal to northward- of Cross Ledge light was also surveyed. A plane of reference for the soundings was obtained by observations of high and low water for a month at the tide-gauge established at Mahon's River. A second gauge was erected on the beach between Mispillion Crook light-house and MurderkilJ Creek, and a third at Cross Ledge light-house. Comparisons were made between these gauges and the gauge at the iron pier, Lewes, Del. At the tide-gauges on Mahon's River and on the beach near Mispillion Creek lighthouse bench-marks were established. Before the close of the season: November 17, one hydrographic sheet, scale 1-20000 had been completed, and another one begun. Lieutenant Winslow calls attention to the want of proper buoyage on the channel side of Joe Flogger Shoal, and remarks that additional buoys in that locality would greatly facilitate navigation. Special mention is also made in Subdivision 15 of the Atlantic Coast Pilot of this absence of buoys. The folrowing-named officers were attached to the party and aided in the work: Ensigns William Truxtun, John S. Watters, and Louis S. Van Duzen, U.S. N. Statisties reported are:

Topographic resurvey in tke vicinity of Oape Henlopen.-Changes of shore.line produced by the action of the sea in the vicinity of Cape Henlopen rendered a speedy resurvey of that locality advisable. Assistant E. Hergesbeimer was accordingly directed to proceed to Lewes, Del., in April, 1884, and to make a survey of the shore-line and adjacent topography of <Jape Henlopen from the ocean shore at the Henlopen light· house sand-dune to the new piers of the fish house on the shore of Delaware Bay. Thii work was executed on the 17th and 18th of April, and comprised three and a half miles of coast line, four and a quarter miles of extreme high-water line, a.nd about one-quarter of a sqnare mile of area. Mr. Hergesheimer reports the following results of his survey: The sea face of the Henlopen light-house dune, immediately in front of the light-house, and two hundred and twehty meters therefrom, is cutting away, so that for a distance of about one hundred meters it shows a caving face of sand, ten to fifteen foet high. The high-water line at the northeast point of the dune bas retreated about five meters since 1882. At two points four hundred and seventy and six hundred and seventy meters in a direct line from Cape Henlopen light-house, the sea washes at extreme high water through openings in the beach of widths of ten and seventy-five meters respectively, communicating between the sand hills with a low wet fiat, which lies to the northward of the dune and extends for about a mile east and west. The beacon light, which in 1882 stood above high-water line, is now about twenty meters outside of the same and seems to be iu great danger of destruction by storm. Since 1882 the extreme northeast point of the cape has advanced forty meters seaward while the extreme northwest point has retreated twenty meters. · At extreme high water the sea washes oYer the northwest face of the cape, and is gradually undermining and cutting away the sand bills between that face and the beacon light, having made inroad at a point about one hundred meters below the beacon to within fifty meters of the ocean. Two piers, each three hundred meters in length, and one hundred and seventy meters apart, the nearest six hundred meters westward of the Government pier, have been built within the laet twelve months, as has been also the Lewes life-saving station, located four hundred and twenty meters east of the railroad wharf and about twenty meters from the beach. These facts being of much importance as im·olving changes in "aids to navigation" in the vicinity of Cape Henlopen, a ''Notice to Mariners" (No. 51) was issued with special reference to the inroads of the sea upon the position of the beacon light, and to the intention of the United States Engineers to fill in the channel between the eastern end of the ice-breaker and the western extremity of the breakwater by laying the foundation for a continuous wall of stone. Since the publication of this notice the Light-House Board has issued one informing navigators of changes in the characteristics of the lights of Cape Henlopen. Under a previous heading in this section report was made of duty executed by Assistant Hergesheimer on the shores of Long Island Sound. Other service assigned to him will be reforred to under the head of Section III. Hydrographic resurvey of Lower Delaware Bay.-During the summer and autumn of 1883 the hydrograpbic resurvey of the lower part of Delaware Bay from Mispillion Creek light-house, on the western shore to Cape Henlopen, was carried on by the party in charge of Lieut. G. C. Hanus, U.S. JS., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Arago. His work was comprised in two hydrographic sheets, each on a scale of 1-20000, the first one including the area between the shore and .the main channel ; the second, that part of the lower bay between the breakwater and Brandywine Shoal. The tide-gauge taken as a standard was a plain box-gauge, established OR the Government iron pier at the Delaware Breakwater. Observatjons were taken at this pier every day during the seaaon of hydrographic work, and night observations were taken also when needed for comparisons with other gauges. A tempomry gauge was established at Cape May Landing to make a eompa.rison between the tides at that point and those at the Breakwater. Other temporary gauges were put in place, but were abandoned after a· few days' obse:r.vations, two of them being carried away by gales. One of these was the gauge secured to Barrel signal, at which enough observa-

40

tipns were obtained to be used for a comparison with the tides at the iron pier. For the tides at this last named point, Lieutenant Hanus has submitted a full tide-table, derived from observations made during one lunation. Many recommendations are made by Lieutenant Hanus in regard to changes in the location of buoys in the lower bay, some of which are deserving of careful consideration. He has made notes also of changes desirable in the sailing directions as depending upon facts brought out d11ring the progress of his survey. The intended closing of the gap between the eastern end of the ice breaker and the western end of the Breakwater will, he observes, very much improve the harbor. The current being then compressed between the eastern end of the Breakwater and Cape Henlopen Point will gradually wear away the latter, and lead to a deepening of the water in the harbor.

Determinations of gravity by pendulum experiments, and comparisons of standards in Europe and in the United States.-The special duty assigned to Assistant Charles S. Peirce in Europe towards the beginning of the present fiscal year was referred to in my last annual report. In .Tune and July, 1883, be carefully compared the Coast and Geodetic Survey standard yard No. 57 with the imperial yard No. I, and also with the iron yard No. 58 at the British Standards Office, London. At the Kew Obserrntory lie determined the flexure of the pier used for pendulum experiments in 1878. This could not be done at the time because the Kew Observatory is built upon the ruins of an ancient monaster.v, and the pier used rested upon three stories of old vaulting. :It was impossible to get to the bottom of this, it being filled up with old rubbish. There was, therefore, nothing to rest a microscope upon so that it would be immovable while the pier swayed, and the attempt to determine the flexure was at the time abandoned. Subsequently Mr. Peirce invented the method of measur·iug the flexure by a noddy or inverted pendulum, which is set in motion by the swaying of the pier. A memoir upon this subject appears in Appendix No. 15. Also in Appendix lG a paper on the effect of the flexure of a pendulum upon its period of oscillation. Afterwards, in Geneva, lie measured the.flexure of the table upon which bis pendulum support rested in the experiGtents of 187.5, these experiments having been made just before his discovery of the importance of taking account of the flexure of peudulum supports. Arriving in Paris, he directed further work on tbe designs of the new Gautier pendulums, and continued to give attention to this subject after his return to the United States in September, 1883. Having resumetl the direction of tl..te pendulum work at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, he was engaged there during part of the winter in swinging the yard and meter pendulums at high and low temperatures, thus determining the ratio of the yard to the meter, and also the coefficient of expansion of the two pendulums. At the pendulum station at the Smithsonian Institution, pendulums Nos. 2 and 3 were oscillated and the length of pendnh1m No. 3 was measured. From Februar,v 1 to .Tune 30, 1884, Subassistant F. H. Parsons was attached to Mr. Peirce's party, and obserrnd oscillations a~ the office. Oomparati11e tkterm.inatioM of 11raoit11 with t/H Kater pen4ulum1 at Wa1hin,gWn.-Speoial refer.

ence was made in my last annual report to the valuable comparative determinations of gravitv obtained by Assistant Edwin Smith with the Kater pendnlums at the Transit ofVenns station i';1 New Zealand, at stations in Australia and Eastern Asia, and at the pendulum station in San Francisco. These three invariable pendulums had been swung by Litmtenant-Coloucl Herschel, KE., at Kew, Greenwich, and Langham, England, and at \Vashington, and Hohokt>ll near New York, in 1881-'82, and to complete the series of comparati'rn determinations Assistant Smith was instructed to swing them at the iltation of Lieutenant-Colonel Herschel in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington. The rebuilding of one of the wings of the Smithsonian Institution, which was in progress at the time of Mr. Smith's return to Washington in July, 1883, delayed the experiments, and it was not till March, 1884, that the room occupied by Lieutenant-Colonel Hel'schel could be placed at his dis. posal. A full report and record of the observations made at this and other stations in pursuance of my instructions issued in September, 1882, has been submitted by Mr. Smith, and will appear as Appendix No. 14. .Annual determination of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity at the station on Capitol Hill, W ashington.-For the determination of the annual change in the values of the magnetic declina. tion, dip, and intensit,y, observations have been made every year fo.eT"enteen successive year8 by Assistant Charles A. Schott at the magnetic observatory on Capitol Hill, Washington. In 1883 the <lays of observation were June 18 and .July 5; in 1884 June 16 and 1 i. The annual change of these elements, as recognized heretofore, is sustained by the new observations. The expression for the declination was reconstructed, resulting in a slight improvement of the representation, which extends now O\'er twenty .eight separate values between li92 an1l 1884. Longitude of Covington, Va., determi1ted by telegraphic exchange.~ of signa,li> with lV a-shington, D. O.; also observations for latitude o.f Oovillgton.-Application having been made by citizens of Yirginia for the determination of the geographical position of Covington, Alleghany County, Snbassistant C.H. Sinclair was instructed to organize a party for that work by the occupation of a station in Covington. Snbassistant :F. H. Parsons was directed to co-operate with Mr. Sinclair by exchanging longitude signals with him from the Coast and Geodetic Survey station at the Naval Observatory. Washington. · Preparations were complete at each station about the 20th of December, 1883, but owing to cloudy and stormy weather it was not till December 28 that an exchange of lon~itude signals was effected. On January 3 and 5 two more nights were obtaine1l for lougitn1le signals, completing the determination to the degree of accuracy required. From the center of the transit pier at CoYington, a meridian line was traced by i\'fr. Sinclair for a distance of 310! feet, and its northern extremity was marked by a stone post. This post and the transit pier were placed under the protection of the town authorities. For the latitude of Covington fifty obsen·ations were made on fifteen pairs of stars on four nights with meridian telescope No. 13. Early in January field operations were closed at the two stations. The records and results of the work have been forwar<led to the office. Occupatwn of stations/or connectingwitli the triangulation the corner st-0nes anrl boundary monu. ment1 of the District of Oolumbia.-It having become desirable to determine in geographical posi. tion the original corner stones of the District of Columbia, an<i such of t,he original mile-stones as remained on the boundary lines, Subassistant O. H. Sinclair was instructed in March, 1884, to make the arrangements necessary for this work. The data extant in the office archives in relation to the points of the original surrnys had previously been carefully collated by the Assistant in charge. He f"ound that the initial point at the south corner of the district, which was marked with much ceremony at Jones Point, nenr Alexandria., on the 15th of April, 1791, is shown on a topographical sheet execute<l in 186-1. Two of the boundary stones are also plotted in position upon this sheet, and the accuracy of the original work by Ellicott is indicated by the fact that a line drawn upon the topographical sheet of 1864, starting from the initial point and (as originally laid out) making at the outset an angle of £60 with the meridian of that point passed exactly through these two boumlary stones.

'Olld topographical sheet, executed in 1863, sl1ows nearly all of the original measurements along

the southeastern line from the Potomac to the east angie of the district. The north angular point, near the house of the late Montgomery Blair, is shown upon a topographical sheet of 1864. Of' the west angular point nothing definite could be learned. The positions thus shown on the topographical sheets were as accurate as their scales of survey, 1-10000 aml 1-15000 would admit of. To bring these positions into connection with the triangulation Mr. Sinclair began his reconnaissance at Jones Point towards the encl of March, and by the 19th of April had complet.,d it, erected the necessary signals, and made the observations. The stations of this triangulation and those of the triaugu!ation of 1880-'81 were then carefuUy marked, earthen ll'are bottles, placed three feet below the surface, being used for the undergronnd ruarks, and for the surface marks, granite blocks 6 inches square and 2 feet long.

Continuation of the detailed topographica,l s1trrey of the District of Oolumbia.-At the beginning of the fiscal ~·ear, July 1, 1883, .the topographical survey of the District of Columbia which had been carried on since February, 1881, on a scale of 1-4:800, had been generally completed over an area bounded on the east by a line drawn northeast from the junction of North Capitol street and Boundary aveune to the northea1't boundary line of the District, thence following the District line to a point midway between the Sargent and J{iggs roads; thence about southwest to the northwest corner of the grounds of the Soldiers' Home; thence following the Rock Creek Church road to Seventh street; thence up Seventh street to Piney Brauch. Following the east,ern slope of Piney Branch Valley to its junction with Rock Creek, the line referred to crossed in a westerly direction to a point midway between the creek and the Tenallytown road, ancl thence ran in a south westerly direction to the northwest corner of West W~sbington (Georgetown). In addition to the area thns outlined, the survey covered a considerable margin on each side of the New Cut road from West Washington to the distributing reservoir. Within the larger area some places, chiefly woodland, remained to be finished. On the 1st of July Assistant Donn moved bis party to the vicinity of Brightwood and began the extension of the surve;y out the Seventh-street· road to Silver Spring, the point of crossing the District line, and over the area lying between that line and the western margin of the work completed during the preceding fiscal year. There were no large bodies of woodland to impede progress, but, before the period of harvest, the growing grain ancl corn-fields and the numerous fences overgrown with briars and bushes presented obstacles of not a slight character. About the 1st of October, work in this locality ha>ing been completed, the survey of the unfinished areas already alluded to was taken up, and early in the winter was finished. The survey was then resumoo iu Rock Creek Valley, at the mouth of Piney Branch, aml carried up the creek to tile dam of Blagden's mill. The winter waR favorable for the survey of the extensh'e w<lodlaml upon the Blagden and Shoemaker estates, but the contouring was of an intricate character. By the close of the winter or before the coming of the leaves the most difficult part of the contour work in the District was completed, the survey having been finished in Rock Creek Valley to Blagden's mill~ and in Broad Branch nearly to the Military road. When the foliage became so dense as to prevent a further continuation of the survey of those valleys, the party was transferred to the ";cinity of the Potoma.C,above West Washington. The shore-lines of the river were surveyed as far as the distributing reservoir, and the topography was extended out the Foxhall road ancl along the western slope of Foundry Branch. A map showing the area surveyed to the close of the fiscal year accompanies the report of Assistant Donn. He acknowledges the earnefft and intelligent assistance rendered by Assistant Wainwright. With regard to the cbaraeter of the work executed, he observes that little wa& left to imperfect or uncertain methods. It represents actual determinations by the plane t.able, or by

that and the level combined. Not only the positions of enr.v house and outbuilding were deter. mined, but their lines were accurately laid down. The completed record of the survey will embrace not only the topographical sheets, but the positions and descriptions of thousands of bench-marks, the great value of which will become apparent when the time arrives for laying out avenues, parks and other works of improvement demanded by the development of the rapidly growing capital.

The large sheets had become much worn by exposure during several field seasons, and by handling in the processes of copying and tracing. Topographic resurvey of the shores of Olterrystone Inlet, l'a.-In pursuance of instructions issued towards the end of May, 1884, Assistant E. Hergesheimer proceeded to Cllerr.vstone, Va., on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay, and made a resurvey of the shores of Cllerrystoue Iulet from its entrance to Cherriton City, and to \Vestcott's, on the opposite shore. Comparisons with Assistant Donn's survey of 1870 showed the following changes: At "-est. cott's Point, the outer point of the north side of the inlet has adrnuce1l soutllwanl one hundred and twenty meter!!; at Mill Point, on the southeast side of the inlet the northwest face of the point has retreated about twenty -th·e meters; the north west face of Fisher's sl10re, on the sou th east side of the inlet, above King's Ureek, has retreated about sixty meters; Uherrystone Island at the north end has retreated five humlred and fifty meters, and since Assistant Bradford's survey in 18i3, one hundred and twenty meters; the south end of the island has advanced one hundred and twenty. five meters. At the southeast entrance to the iulet below King's Ureek, at the extreme point of the curve between Tazewell station and King's Ol'eek, the shore has retreated thirty metcn;. On the 10th of June, at low water, l\lr. llergesheimer measuretl with special care the width between low-water lines of the 1:mtrance to Kiug'ti Creek and found it to be sixty-niuc meters, or very nearly 75.5 yards. A knowledge of thiti width is impot·tant to the owners of land on the creek, as the laws of Virginia provide for certain oyster privileges where the 1:mtrance to a creek between low-water lines is not more than one hundred yards. The marble post marking Cherry Grove station was found and Tazewell station was re-marked, but of Cherrystone station, on the island of that name, no trace could be found, the severe gale that swept over the island in August, 1878, having probably obliterated the station marks. Other field-work executed by Assistant Hergesheimer has been referred to under the headlng of Section II. · Topographic st·rvey in the vicinity of the headwaters of Lynnhaven Bay, Ya.-Additional details of topography being needed to complete the surv1;1ys in the vicinity of Norfolk, Va., Assistant Eugene Ellicott was directed to proceed to that city towards the end of May, 1884, and take up the topography of the headwaters of Lynnhaven Bay. Ou reaching the field be found that most of the points of the old triangulation bad been lost or destroyed; this oooa.sioned delay in beginning the plane-table survey, and it became advisable to devote the Hmit.ed tjIQe available for the work to the completion of shore-line and the location

Hydrograpliic surveys in the south branch of Elizabeth Rii,cr, a1td in North Landing River and Back Bay, Va.-Upon the completion of certain bydrographic work in North Carolina, which will . be referred to under the heading of Section IV, Lieut. G. 0. Banus, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Arago, was directed in the spring of 1884 to make a hsdrngraphic reconnaissance of the south branch of Elizabeth River and of North River and Back Bay. To obtain a plane of reference for the soundings in Elizabeth River (south branch), the benchmark establislled IJy Lieutenant-Commander 'l'homas, CT. S. N., on the sea-wall in the timber slip at the :Norfolk mwy-,rard was used, and for comparison with it a secon<l gauge was placed at the iron railroad bridge five miles above the navy-yard. The soundings show that the water has deepened since tb1~ former survey, and Lieutenant Hanus attributes this to the fact that the extensi\·e dredging near Norfolk has caused stronger ti<lal currents above.

Ile found tliat onl~· two and half fe,et of water could be carried from Currituck Sound into Back Bay, but in the bay proper au average depth of from five to six feet was developed. A species of grass grows all o\·er the bottom of this bay, and in summer, when it reaches its full height, it is said to be almost impossible for boats to move about in it. Even fiat-bottomed vessels, drawing only r.wo or two aml a lrnlf feet, have to exercise care in navigating this bay on account of the thouisauds of obstructions in the shape of old "duck-blinds," many of which no longer show above the surface of the water. The shores of the bay are thickly settled, and the annual exports of fish and game are a great source of wealth.

As it is well known that the tides in Back Bay are affected only by the wind, the permanent water-mark on the wharf at Knott's Landing was taken as mean low water, all other gauges and observations being referred to this mark. In North Landing River, the head of which is in Virginia and the entrance in North Carolina, Lieute1iaut Hanus ohtaiuetl all the soundings desired, and ca1Tied the work up the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal, thus connecting it with the work in the south branch of Elizabeth River. In North Lauding River, as in Dack Bay, the only rise and fall in tbe water is due to the wind, and the permanent water-mark on t.he landing at Pungo Ferry was takt:Jn as mean low water. All records of these several surveys have been transmitted to the office. Lin.es of leveling of precision carried from Hagerstown, Md., toward8 l!'ortress Monroe, Va.For the purpose of referring the height of the bench-mark in the transcontinental line of geodesic leveling at Hagerstown, Md., to a second point on the Atlantic coast, this bench-mark having been connected with the tidal level at Sandy Hook in 1881,·SubassistantJ. B. Weir was instructed to proceed to Hagerstown early in the fiscal year, ancl organize a party for running a line of geodesic levels towards Fortl'ess Monroe.

Having determined the constants of his instrument, Mr. Weir began work at Hagerstown, July 24, and from that station to Weverton, Md., carried his line of levels over tbe Washington County Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The grades along this road are very heavy, in somH places as. much as 1 in 57, and in order not to have the line of sight running too uear the ground, the sights taken were very short. It was found hy experience that work done on clear aud calm days during the time of the greatest beat from about 10.30 a. m. to 2.30 p. m. was not trustworthy. From Weverton to Alexandria, Va., the line of levels followed the tow-path of the Cl1esa· peake and Ohio Canal. No special difficulties were encountered in this reach except those due to the numerous sharp curves in the canal, which compelled many short sights to be taken. On reaching the aqueduct bridge across the Potomac, it was found that the instrument could be reallil.Y set up on any one of the eight stone piers on which the bridge rests, thus permitting short and equal sights to be taken under very favorable conditions. A beuch-ruark having been established on the north side of the rh-er, and one on the south side, three independent lines were run between these benches. From Alexandria to Ashland. Va., where the work clo&.ed for the season, the line was carried along the Alexandria and :Fredericksburg Railroad to Quantico, and thence along the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad to Ashland. Between Fredericksburg and Ashland there were four bridges or trestle works; great care was exercised in crossing these, the instrument beinl!' first set up on solid ground, as near one end of the bridge as possible, and the two leveling rod8 set up successively on a bench-mark established at a. suitable distance from the ini,;trument. The readings of the rods having been noted, tbe.r were transferred to the center of the hridge, and ha,·e ing been placed successively on the same point, from three to five sets of observations were made on each rod. The instrullleut was then transferred m; soon as possible to a station established 011 the solid ground near the other end of the bridge, the rods remaining at the center, and from three to five sets of observations again made on each. The series owr the bridges was then completed by placing the rods on a bench-mark at some distance from the instrument and again reading them. The foresights and backsights being taken in opposite directions over distances of nearly equal length, and the time elapsing between the two sights being short, it was assumed that they were made under the same atmospheric conditions, and that they were equally affected by an.r change of refraction caused by the line of sight passing over water. Field-work was suspended for the season on October 31, and a bench-mark establishell on the D11ncan l\lemorial Chapel at Randolph and Macon College, Ashlaud, Va. The method of working throughout the season was that followed on the line of transcontinental levels, namely, to run two parallel lines simultaneously in the same direction, one by rod A, the other by rod B, the rods being pla-0ed at different distances from the instrument-geodesic level No. 1. In order to eliminate any cumulative error that might result from ruuniIJg constantly in one direction, alternate sections of the line were run in opposite directions. As the work progressed the field computations were kept up, and after the close of the season the records, original and duplicate, and statements of resultiug heights of bench-marks were completed and forwarded to the office. For the two lines the field computations indicated a probable error of eight-tenths of a millimeter per kilometer, or about three-hundredths of an inch in fi\'eeighths of a mile, and in the l1eight of the bench-mark at Ashland a probable error of a little more than half an inch (13.3mm). Mr. John Nelson served as actiug aid in the party; the efficient and cheerful assistance rendered by him is acknowledged by bis chief. Later in the year Mr. Weir was assigned to duty, reference to which will be made under the heading of Section VIII. ·

O<mnecti<Jn of tke aatr<momical stati<tn at Straiburg, Va., witk tl1e triangulation; magnetic olJaervationl at Straiburg.-Tbe geographical position. of Strasburg bad been determined in 1881, but as it was not then practicable to connect the station with tl1e primary triangulation, that work was postponed. Towards the end of May, 1884, Subassistant C. B. Sinclair was directed to make a rooonnaiSRall~ for the purpose of completing this connection. Starting from the line Bull RunMount Marshall as a. base, Mr. Sinclair found that a third point, ''High Knob," couJd be located on the Blue Ridge, commanding views of Strasburg and of the Massanutten Range, from which

also the Strasburg station could be seen. On this range a new point, "Keller," was established, and the connection made with Strasburg by means of the triangles, Bnll Run-High KuolJ,..Mount .Marshall; Keller-High Knob-Mount Marshall; and High Knob-Keller-Strasburg. All of the stations needed were occupied and observations finished June 24. For comparison with the results obtained at Strasburg for magnetic declination in i873 1 at which time it had been occupied as one of the stations in the Bache :Fund magnetic series, a second determination was made by l\Ir. Sinclair near the old station, June 25, 26, and 27, with the Bache Fnncl magnetometer. Mr. Sinclair commends the untiring euergy of Mr. Isaac Winston, who was attached as aid to the party.

Va., by exohanges of telegraphic signals with the station at Loitisville, J(y. All observations for the latitude of Charleston.-A longitude station · had been erected in 1881 in the grounds of the State capitol building in Charleston, W. Va., in anticipation of its immetliate occupation. Unforeseen events compelled a postponement of the work. In August, 1883, advantage was taken of the presence of a longitude party at Louisville, Ky., in charge of Assistant G. W. Dean, to determine the lougitude. Subassistant F. H. Parsons was directed to occupy the Charleston station. Between the 16th a11d 25th of August, longitude signals were succ~ssfully exchanged on five nights, after which l\Ir. Parsons exchanged places with Mr. Carlisle Terry, jr., who _!lad made the observatiorn· at LonisYille. In the new position of obseners successful exchanges were obtained on six nights between August 29 and September 5, completing the longitude work. :For the latitude of the station at. Charleston, one hundred and eleven observations were made ou twenty-one pairs of stars ou six nights, Mr. Parsons observing on three nights and Mr. Terry on three. In these observations transit No. 6, which had been adapted for use as a zenith telescope, was employed. Other determinatiorns of long·itude by Assistant Dean, SubassiBtant Parsons, and Mr. Terry, are referred to under the headings of Sections XIII and XIV. Extension westwcird of the primary triangulation near tlie thirty-ninth parallel in West Virginia and Ohio.-Referencc was made in my last annual report to the work of Assistant A. T. Mosman, in t:harge of a party which, at the beginning of July, 1883, had been engaged since the 20th of May uf that ~·ear in the continuation of the primary triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel in West Virginia and Ohio. It was found necessary to erect high tripods and scaft'olds at three of the stations to be obsernd upon. In this duty Assistant Mosman had the aid of Subassistant Pratt from May 29 until June 30, when he was detached . .All of the difficulties presented by the nature of the country, and by the necessity of hiring inexperienced hands for this service, were overcome by the skill aud energy of l\Ir. Pratt, to whom, as l\Ir. l\Iosman states in his report, is due the successful completion of this portion of the work in a short time and at small expense. On the 9th of July Mr. Mosman organized bis party at Milton, W. Va., and by the 15th of that month was at Pigeon station, thirty miles distant, in readiness to begin observations. Helio· tropers having been posted, and all lines opened, the work was pushed at all intervals of favorable weather. By the 5th of August all needed observations had been obtained. A road having in the meantime been built up the mountain at Piney station, W. Va., camp was pitched there about August 11; concrete piers for the theodolite and the meridian telescope were built;, and by the 21st all was in readiness for observations. Measurements of horizontal angles, and observations for time, latitude, aml azimuth, were made until September 24, many interruptions having occurred from rainy and stormy weather. While work was in progress at Piney station two tripod and scaf. fold signals were built,. one at station Wray, in Ohio, eighty feet high1 and one at station Oakland, Ky., fifty feot in height.

Unfavorable weather delayed the beginning of observations at the nexf station, Davis, in W Va., until October 8. The measurements of horizontal angles required here were completed Octo· her 19, and station Gebhardt, W. Va., was occupied between October 28 and November 10. After that <la.te, and until December 4, when the season closed, the party was employeu in visiting and marking stations, anu obtaining reconnaissance angles, to get the height neecled for a tripod and scaffold signal at station Gould, in Ohio. In this duty very cold and stormy weather was encountered. Mr. W~ B. Faidield, extra observer, was attached t-0 the party from July Hi to the end of the season. The highl;y efficient and satisfactory manner in which all of his duties were discharged is commended by Mr. Mosman in his report. The obsHvations for zenith distance with the vertical circle, and those for latitude and value of micrometer, were made by him, and he assisted in the observations for time and azimuth.

Determination of the boundary lines bet1reen the States <!f Pe11nsylrnnia and \l'i;st Vfrginia.-A full account bas already been given, under the beading of Section II, of the surrny and marking of the meridian and parallel boundary lines between the States of Penns~·lvauia and \Vest Yirgmia at the request of the Joint Commissioners of those States. The meridian boundaQ·, as determined by Su bassistant Sinclair, and as marked by himself and Suhassistant Van Ord en, after adoption by the Joint Commissioners, was a straight line through the southwest corner of Pennsylvania and the first stone south of the Ohio~ this stone having been placed in the meridian of the grauite monument on the Ohio ancl Penm;yl\'ania boundary. After the completion of this work, a portion of the boundary which runs eastward from the southeast corner of Penns_yh'ania was traced out and marked. This line follows the parallel of 39° 40'.3 nearly for a distance of about fifty.fh·erniles to the Maryland corner. More detailed mention of these operations will be found, as just stated, under the heading of Section II. SECTION IV.

Triangula.tion, topography, and hydrograpliy 'if N()rih River, N. 0.-In pursuance of instructions issued in February, 1884, Lieut. G. C. Hanus, U. S. N_, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Snn·e~', com· mantling the steamer Arago, proceeded to North River, N. C., for the purpose of making a surYey of that stream. Having meagured a base line, signals were erected for the triangulation, and after a sufficient number of points had been determined, the topography of the shores of the river was connected with the south end of the southern cut of the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal, and the hydrograpby was completed to Currituck: Sound. The tides in North Landing Uiver being a1J'ecte.d by the wind only, Lieutenant Hanus assumed a mean low-water le\"'el corresponding to t,he permanent water-mark on the coal wharf, observing that this mark agreed with the two-foot mark on the gauge which he had established on this wharf.

Other bydrograpbic work executed by Lieutenant Hanus i8 referred to under the headings of Sections II, III, and IX. Verification of hydrograpliy for tlie Atlantic Coast Pilot.-In order to obtain a careful revision of sailing directions for the Atlantic Coaist Pilot by following the same and verifying the courses and depths, Lieut. J. E. Pillsbury, U.S. N., Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, was directed in Novembn, 1883, to make the verifications needed for the first subdivision of Volume IV, Atlantic Coast Pilot, south of Cape Henry. Proceeding to Hampton Roads with the intention of taking command of tbe schooner Ready, Lieutenant Pillsbury availed himself of an interval before tbe arrival of that vessel to make a short preliminary cruise through the sounds of North Caroliua. .For this opportunity, which he found to be of great advantage in obtaining a personal knowledge of these sounds, he was indebted to the courtesy of the officers of the light-house tender Violet. He was thus enabled to visit Pamplico R.iver, the Pungo, Hatteras Inlet, Bodie's Island anchorage, and Edenton, retur11ing to Hampton Roads to join the Ready. Thence he proceeded to the outside coast, and subsequently to Washington, where he awaited the arrival of the steamer Arago. The Arago having been fitted for winter work, I~ieutenant Pillsbury resumed command of ber, and ieft Washington December 12. Through the kindness of Marshall Parks, esq., president of the Chesapeake and Albemarle Canal Company, a pass was obtained for the Arago through the canal. While passing through, a reconnaisance of it was made to obtain data for showing its course and direction on the smaller scale charts. All the important points in Pamplico and Albemarle Sounds were visited in the Arago. On reaching Core Sound it was found impracticable without very great labor to take the sh~amer over Pine:r Point Bar; Lieutenant Pillsbury decided, ther"'fore, to leave the vessel and proceed by rail to Wilmington to make the examinations required iu Cape Fear River. At Wilmington a steam· tug was placed at his disposal through the kindness of :Mr. Henry Bacon, assistant engineer officer in charge of the improvements in the lower river. These improvements are still in progress; channels are to be dredged through three shoals between Orton's Point and Eagle Island; the changes in topography and in the soundings, resulting from works of construction, wiH involve the necessity of resurveys as soon as these works have progressed sufficiently. In order to make the present chart of the river of value, Lieutenant Pillsbury forwarded tot.be office a copy corrected by me.ans of data obtained from the assistant engineer. The two charts showing the river from near Wilmington to its mouth have been brought up to date, and are now ready for ii::sue. Having remarked a considerable change in the Swash Cbannel over the Bulkhead Shoal at Hatteras Inlet, he made a survey at this point to develop the amount of change and to correct the published charts. Similar duty of inspection performed by Lieutenant Pillsbury on the coast of South Oa.l'olina and Georgia is referre1.l to under tbe beading of Section V.

Ver·ification of hydrography for the Atlantic Coast Pilot.-To complete the verification of courses, depths, and sailing directions for subdivision number twenty of the Atlantic Coast Pi1ot, included in which are the coast from Wiuyah Bay to Savannah, and the continuous inland passages from Winyah Bay to Fernandina, Lieut. J.E. Pillsbury, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, in the spring of 1884, was instructed to make examinations similar to those referred to under the beading of Section IV, on the coasts of South Carolina and Georgia. Beginning at Winyah Bay, inspection was made successively at Bull's Bay, Charleston Bar, Stono Inlet, North Edisto and South Edist-0 Rivers, Saint Helena Sound, Port Royal and Tybee entrances, Savannah River, and the inland passages from Sarnnnah south to Fernandina. But few changes of importance were noted. These are referred to in the following extracts frum Lieutenant Pillsbury's report : · 14 Bull's Bay, I think, bas altered somewhat since the surve~· by Lieutenant Maffit. I could not discover on the cou1·ses generally used in entering the bay as much water by about oue foot as called for, and the shoals inside have changed to such an extent as to render an entirely different course necessary in crossing the ha;y. "Charleston Bar.-1 have seen recently many. statements in print as to the changes in the Pumpkin Hill channel, and that rnssels have been obliged to wait for spring tide t-0 carry fonrteen and a half or fifteen feet of water. I have endeavored to ascertain the correctness of the statement relating to the change, and m~' conclusion is that the chart as 11ow issued is correct. At the office of the U. S. Army Engineers in charge of the impro,·ements I was allowed to examine their larest snn·eys, and one made but three months before showed a good channel of eleven and a half feet in depth. It was, however, a very little to the southward of that shown on the chart, but so little that the chart may be said to be correct. The South Channel as shown is correct also, and at the point at which the depths of over twelve feet are· continuous across this bar, the channel ma.y be followed exactly as indicated. The Swash Channel, now under improvement, has a nar· row and tortuous twelve-foot channel, but for strangers it is practicable only for ten feet. "8tono lnlet.-This bar has changed radically. At the time of the sun·e~- it was shallow, and was situated far to the southward of the mouth of the inlet. It has 11ow brokeu through nearly in the prolongation of the inlet, and bas deepened considerably, making it uecessary to correct the entire chart. Lieutenant Pillsbury calls attention to the need of a survey of the two most difficult parts of the inland passage between Charleston and Savannah, the first extending from the Stono Rh-er, near Wa1)poo Creek, through Church Flats and Wadmelaw Sound; and the other, Mosquito Creek, between the South Edisto and Ai.hepoo Ri\·ers. He observes, also, that additional surveys are required in the Ashley and Cooper Rivers-particularly in the former, which has assumed considerable importance commercially since the estab· lisbment of phosphate mills on its banks. Lieutenant Pillsbury will embody the results of his examinations in a forthcoming \·olume of the Atlantic Ooast Pilot. Rooon:naissance for the extension of the pri1nary triangulation in Nortlterti Georgia. and Alabama wwards tfu! Gulf oot.Mt.-In May, 1884, Assistant O. H. Tjttman was instructed to organize a party
for reconnaissance, with a view of dereloping a scheme for carrying the primary triangulation in Northern Georgia and Alabam.a towards the coast of the Gulf of Mexico at or near Mobile, Ala. After visiting a number of stations in Northern Georgia, Mr. Tittmau found that none of the lines connecting them were available a.s a base for t}\e extension of the triangulation southward. Further examinations from point.s to the westward of those first visited made it apparent that the line India.n-Anrora in Northern Alabama WM best suited to his purpose. The former station, just west of the boundary between the two States, is on the crest of the highest ridge east of the Coosa River, the latter on the highest ridge to the west of it, the distance between the two stations being H.Ex. 43--7

50

about forty-five miles. From this line as a base it appeared practicable to carry the triangulation down the river. East of the Coosa the highest ridges are found, and they rise to relatively mountainous proportions about twelve miles south of Anniston, Calhoun Oonnt,y, Ala., attaining there an altitude of about two thousand five hundred feet above the sea. A dense haze wbicl1 prevailed until the middle of June, and after tllat date incessant rains, delayed greatly the advance of the reconnaissance. The last point visited was Shackford, about sixty-one miles southwest of Aurora. The lieights a.re all thickly wooded, with a growth of hickory, oak, and pine, generally not exceeding a height of seventy feet. On account of the dense foliage it wiU be advantageous to coutinne the reconnaissance after the leaves are off the trees. Mr. Tittman was efficiently aided by Messrs. W. B. Fairfield and J. H. 'l'urner. He closed work towards the end of J nne and will resume it about the beginning of winter. SECTION VI.

Completion, of the survey of the east coast of Florida, betmeen Lake Worth and Nm~ River.-At the close of the last fiscal year the shore survey of the eastern coast of Florida had been finished with the exception of that part of the coast bt>tween Lake Worth and New Inlet. In November, 1883, Assistant B. A. Colonna was directed to organize a party to fill up this gap in the general mapping of the east coast. The officers assigned to assist him in this duty were Ensign T. G. Dewey, U. S. N., who acted as executive officer of the sloop Steadfast, and who was placed by Mr. Colonna in charge of the hydrographic work, and Messrs. T. P. Bordeu and E. L. Taney, Aids, who had each a plane-table for the execution of the topography. All preliminary arrangements having been completed, the party rendezvoused at Hillsboro' Inlet about the middle of December. The h;ydrography of New River and Inlet was begun soon after by Ensign Dewey, aided by Mr. Taney, and upon its completion Messrs. Colonna and Dewey sounded out Hillsboro' River and Inlet and the creeks in the vicinity. The hydrography of Lake Worth was done by Messrs. Dewey and Borden, and the unfinished portion of hydrograpby of Jupiter Inlet by Messrs. Colonna and Dewey. At Key Biscayne Bay, the bydrograpby of the head of the bay was finished, and also that of the creeks flowing into it from the northward and westward. The general limits of bydre>graphic work were from South Jupiter Na!Tows to the head of Key Biscayne Bay. That portion of the topography beginning at Fort Lauderdale, about three and a half miles north of New River Inlet: and extending north to Hillsboro' Inlet, was executed by Mr. Taney. At Hillsboro' Inlet hi11 work joined with that of Mr. Borden, by whom the topogrophy from Hillsboro' Inlet was completed to Lake Worth. With regard to the character of the country surveyed, Mr. Taney remarks that on the east is the ocean beach sand ridge; back of this, New River and a mangrove swamp cut up by a great many creeks, bays, &c., and west of this pine woods. A mile or two north of Fort Lauderdale the mangrove disappears and the country between the sand ridge on the east and the pine woods on the west is simply an immense marsh, covered with saw-grass and cut up by innumerable creeks. There is, however, one principal creek, and during high water Rmall boats may pass through to Hillsboro' Inlet. The pieoo of topography which Mr. Borden regarded as the most difficult of his season'R work waa through the saw-grass route from Haulover Head on Lake Worth to the Rapids on Lake Worth Creek. This grass, often more than breast-high, with serrated edges and a very dense growth, did not admit of rapid progress with the plane-table. Mr. Borden began work through it at noon of one day, slept in it in bis boat at night, and reached the rapids next day at 3 p.m., completing the topo2raphy. Four stations were occupied under Mr. Colonna.'R direction during the season for determining

the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity. His report expresses his gratification with the earnest efforts made by the members of his party to advance the work, and praises their cheerful endurance of all privations and discomforts incident to its rapid execution. Field operations were closed early in April. _Upon returning to the office .Assistant Colonna remained in charge of the party, directing the office work until May 15, when he was relieved and directed to prepare for duty in the Strait of Fuca, W. T. Ensign Dewey wa8 detached May 1. The records and computations of the survey were completed by Mr. Borden.

J.C. Fremont, jr., U.S. N., .Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, crimmanding the schooner Drift. In February, 1884, the Drift was prepared for similar work in the Gulf Stream, and left port under the command of Lieutenant Fremont March 4. The i;itations occupied crossed the stream between Jupiter Inlet, east coast of Florida, and Memory Rock, Bahama Banks. The experience acquired during previous seasons led to improvements in the plans of the cruise and in the instruments and methods of observation. Except in the case of the station near Memory Rock, the general characteristics of the current of the Gulf Stream were the same as those observed the year before. The direction of the current at the several stations was north, though varying a few degrees on either side. The velocities differed according to locality, those very near the shore being of less \'elocity than those farther out. But, contrary to expectation, the greatest velocity was not found at the supposed center of the stream, but somewhat westward of it. The greatest velocity noted was four and seven-tenths knots, in latitude 27° 05' north and longitude 790 44' west. The depth here was only one hundred and ninety fathoms ; the distance west from the supposed axis of the stream nearly ten miles, and from the Florida coast about. twenty miles . .A.t Memory Rock a current was found running in a direction between east and south, with a velocity ot' only from one-tenth to six-tenths of a knot. Lieutenant Fremont refers to this station as a very dangerous one to occupy in the event of a strong wiud cowing up from the westward. The shelly bottom has not sufficient tenacity to keep the vessel from dragging towards the rocks or bank, and if sail is made the vessel will not pay off after the anchor is clear of the bottom, but will ride to the long drift of the hawser, as to a dra.g, and drift rapidly to leeward. He observes further that the weather in the Gulf Stream cannot be depended upon even in .April, May, and June, but that in the vicinity of his work severe and sudden blows are not infrequent. The strains upon the vessel are then enormous. In the report of his season's work Lieutenant Fremont has embodied suggestions in regard to methods of handling the cable, the advantage of having a separate reel upon which to keep it permanently, &c. These snggestiom;;, the result of much experience in current obsP.rvations, will receive due consideration. · The Drift returned to port June 27.

Triangitlation of the irest coast of Florida fo the vicinity nf Punta Rasa.-Ravi1ig refitted the schooner Qniek at Manatee, Fla., i11 the latter part of Nowmber and bt>ginning of Decembt>r, 1883, Assistant Joseph Bergesheimer proceeded in her to Punta Rasa, on San Carlos BaJ, and, in accordance with instructions, began in that Yicinif_y a triangulation to bt> carried southward along tbe coast. The stations White Sword Point and Middle Point were recovered, and from this line as a base the triangu1atio11, supplemented by a beach measuremeut, was pushd southward from San Carlos Bay across to and oYer OJster Ba~·, and thence to Wiggi11s Pass, lJetween latitudes 26° 17' and 26° 18' north. A distance of twent_y.five miles of coast line was thus covered. Towards the close of March pre1larntiom; were made for suspending field work. On tl1e return to Manatee to lay up the schooner, Mr. Berglc'slwimer stop1ied at .Anna Marin Key, 'fampa Bay, and in order to te::-t the aecura!'y of the :ippaiatus used in his bea<'h measurement, measured with it a base 2,950 metens iu length which bad been established tht>re liy .Ai;si11tant Ogdeu.

Hydrographic surveys in the vicinity of the Ancfote Keys, in Lemon Bay, and near San Oarlos Bay, west coast of Fforida.-Towards the close of January, 1884, tbe steamer Bache, having on board the bydrographic party of Lieut. B. B. Mansfield, U.S. N., Assistant Uoast and Geodetic Survey, arrived in the vicinit.y of Anclote Keys, in pursuance of instructions, for hydrographic surveys on the west coast of Florida from the Anclote Keys southward, and in Lemon Bay and near San f'arlos Bay. In co-operation with Subassistant Vinal a search was immediately begun for shore stations, and on the 10th of February soundings were commenced and continued whenever the weather per. mitted, the season being uuusually stormy, until .April 17. During tbis period the hydrography was complet.ed from latitude 28° 15' north, to the northward of North Anclote Key, as far nearly as latitude 28° 00' north, just to the southward of Big Pass entrance into Saint Joseph's Bay. At Anclote the meau low-water plane of reference for the soundings was obtained from the mean of high and low waters taken day and night for two weeks. Lieutenant Mansfield states that the harbor formed by the Anclote Ke;ys is a fine anchorage at all times for vessels drawing not over seven feet of water, being easy of access and sheltered from all winds, with good holding ground. At high water, vessels drawing nine feet can enter. Once inside no harm will ensue should the ,·essel ground at half-tide, the bottom being soft. This harbor is a favorite one for the spongers; as many as thirty-five small schooners have been seen there at anchor at one time. For the inshore hydrography north of Big Pass and the soundings in Anclote River the statistics are:

He found signals established in position b.Y the topographical party that was in advance of him, and was thus enabled to push the work forward at once; be was favored also by the weather, which from having been very uncertain all wiuter, had theu become settled. On reaching the limit of the triangulation and beach measurement at Wiggins Pass, he carried tl1e liydrography about 10 miles further down the coast, completing it to that limit May 29. At Lemon Bay and in the vicinity of San Carlos Bay permanent bench-marks were established near each temporary tide-gauge. Full specimens of the bottom were taken at each angle and position, and after careful selection characteristic specimens were preserved and sent to the office. Ensigns J. M. Orchard, J. P. Parker, J.

Topographic survey from the .Anclote Keys southward; west coast of Florida.-In continuation of the t.opographic survey of the west coast of Florida Subasisistant W. I. Vinal reached Anclote, Fla., January 17, 1884, and awaited there the arrival of the steamer Bache, expecting to obtain by the courtesy of her commander transportation for himself and party and other facilities for the work. In co-operation with Lieutenant Mansfield, a careful examination was made of the coast for station marks, but nearly all traces of the triangulation of 1857-1861 bad disappeared. One tertiary point was identified and the positions of two occupied stations were closely approximated. With assistance from the party on the Bache, signals were erected as near as possible to the posi· tion of the original triangulatfon points. These and .such other signals as were necessary for continuing the topographic and hydrographic surveys were located and plotted by determinations with the sextant and plane-table. The work was carried steadily forward, covering part of the Anclote Keys, the shores of Anclote River and of Saint Joseph's Bay, till the latter pa.rt of May, when it had reached a point about two miles south of Dunedin post-office, Hillsborough County. More than usual difficult.y was experienced in conducting the survey on account of extremely shoal water along the coast.

Mention is also made, under the heading of Section I, of other duty assigned to .Assistant Tittman.

Line of levels of precis-ion carried from the Gulf coast near Mobile toward a point on the transcontimmtal line of geodesic leve!ing.-For the purpose of connecting the tidal level of the Gulf of Mexico with that of the North Atlantic by carrying a line of geodesic levels from a station near Mobile to a point on t.be transcontinental line of precise leveling, already referred by that line to the tidal
bench-mark at Sandy Hook, 1:3ubassistant J. B. Weir was directed early in February, 1884, to proceed to Mobile and organize a geodesic leveling party. Having established a permanent bench-mark on the custom-house in Mobile as the initial point of the line, Mr. Weir GftITied the work forward along the Mobile and Ohio Railroad to Citronelle, .Ala., a distance of thirty-two miles. At this point, owing to the want of transportation at times suitable for the work, a bench-mark was established and the party transferred to Meridian, Miss., at wllich point the line of leYels was resumed, and continued along the same line of railroad to Okalona, Miss., which is two hundred and sixty·one miles from Mobile. The gap of one hundred and two miles between Citronelle and Meridian will be filled hereafter. Field operations were closed at Okalona May 5. The original records and duplicates, wit.h maps showing 1he route followed, and a table of resulting heights of the bench·marks from the field computations, were trausmitted to the office soon aftf_'lr the close of the fiscal year. Throughout the season the method of working was that pursued on the transcontinental line of geodesic leveling, namely, to run two parallel lines simultaneously and in the same direction, one by rod E and the other by rod F, the rods .being placed at difi'erent distances from the instrument, and any cumulative error that might result from running constantly in one direction being guarded against Lly running alternate sections of from ten to twelve miles in opposite directions. By tlie field computations a probable error is shown for the two parallel lines of seven-tenths of a millimeter for a kilometer, or about three-hundredths of an inch in five.eighths of a statute mile. The instrument used was geodesic level No. 1. Mr. Jolin Nelson served as acting aid in the party with credit to himself and satisfaction to his chief. Similar duty exeeuted by Mr. Weir is referred to under the beading of Section III. Continuation of tlie s1.1.n:ey of the Gulf co:ist of Louisiana trestward of the delta of the Mis8ilt8ippi.Instructions issued to .Assistant Charles Hosmer, in N ovem her, 1883, directed him to organize a party for the completion of the survey of the coast of Louisiana immediately to the west of the Mississippi River. .Assistant Hosmer, at the time these instructions reached him, was engaged in work on Long Island Sound, reference to which was made under the heading of Section II, in this report. At as early a date as practicable he proceeded to New Orleans, and took charge of the steamer Barataria, the necessary repairs to which were not completed till early in January, 1884. The survey was begun Jannary 17, and the most important part of it finished by the 1st of .Apr~J. Its locality being chiefly in the network of bays, passes, and bayous between the Lower Mississippi

and Barataria Bay, progress was much interfered with by the high stage of water in the ri,·er, and the consequent inundation of the country under survey. Special difficulty was met with in what is known as "The J um11," an outlet of the river inu1 Red Pass. This outlet, wide and deep at first, soon divides into a number of small gtreams, all of which maintain a considerable depth to the marsh line which represents the Gulf coast, and then shoal up so rapidly that it was found impossible to cross the bars in even the smallest boats. This made it necessary to postpone the execution of the inshore hydrograpby of the Gulf. The main passage way to the Gulf was sounded out, but it was uot deemed advisable to sound the smaller streams in consequence of the continuous changes. ·work in The Jump bad just been completed when the great rise in the river took place, and soon after it became necessary to find a safe mooring place for the Barataria. Fortunately this was found at. the custom-house wharf at the quarantine station. Field opera.tions were closed, and the steamer taken to New Orleans, April 3. Mr. Carlisle Terry, jr., was attached to the party as .A id, and rendered acceptable service till bis detachment, March 19, for other duty. Ensign Alfred Jeffries, "G. S. N., served as executive officer and aided in the hydrographic work. The vessel was transferred to his charge to be laid up on the 10th of April.

Continuation of the survey of the Gulf coast of Loui..<riana. from Calcasieu Pass east·ward.-In De· cember, 1883, in pursuance of instructions issued towards the close of November in that year, Assistant F. W. Perkins proceeded to the vicinit_y of CalcaBieu Pass, La., and by the 14th of January, 1884, bad begun the triangulation and topography of the coast from the line Mangrove-Mud Lake, just to the west of the pass. From this line the survey was carried eastward along the Gulf coast for a distance of about forty miles to a point within about three miles of Joseph's Harbor Bayou. Owing to the nature of the shores, which are low and subject to overflow, the impassable swamps separating the coast from the hard ridges in the back country, and the shallow bars at the en· trances to the few inlets along the coast, camps are in a measure unsafe, and vessels of ordinar,y build are not available. Under these circumstances, Mr. Perkins deemed it advisable t,o push the triangulatio11 ahead as mpidly as the small appropriation allotted for the work would permit, and to confine the to· pograpby to those sections which could not be reached from a vessel lying in the large inlets, or from camps located on the hard ridges in the back countrJ·. B~· this plan the topographic surve~· of the more difficult and inaccessible places was completed. For transporting camp equipage, signal lumber, and stores along the coast a small schooner of light draught was chartered, and by taking advantage of calm weather for landing on the beach no serious accident occurred, t.hough the force of but three men was hardly enough to guard the camp against the not infrequent inroads of the sea, which threatened to sweep it away, and to take care also of the schooner outside till the water should rise sufficiently on the bar of some neighboring inlet to admit of making a harbor. With regard to passes or inlets having shifting sand.bars off' their mouths, like Calcasieu Pass, Mr. Perkins observes that the changes in depth and direction of channel are so rapid aucl great that no hydrographic survey or sailing directions are a safe guide to an entrance. On the Gulf coast, where the sea is so tranquil that on most days a pilot can go out in a small boat and locate the deepest part of the-bar, it is not uncommon to find a system of range-beacons maintained on shore by means of which vessels enter. But as this is nearly always a private enterprise and supported by rather irregular contributions, Mr. Perkins snggesra that at such entrances a ss-stem

Louisiana between Galveston entrance and Calcasieu Pass, Lieut. E. D. F. Heald,U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was instructed in the winter of 1883-'84 to take command of the steamer Gedney, and, after completing her preparation for service, to proceed with the vessel and party organized on board of her to Galveston. The soundings were begun early in 1884, at a point off the coast about thirty miles to the west· ward of Sabine Pass, and carried on to a position about thirteen miles to the eastward of that pass. Lines of soundings normal to the shore were run to an avemge distance of forty.five miles from it. This survey was executed on a scale of 1-80000. A special survey of Sabine Pass was made on a scale of 1-20000. To obtain a plane of reference for the soundings, tidal observations were made at Galveston from March 1 to June 16, inclush-e, and at Sabine Pass from June 6 to June 10, inclusive. In April Lieutenant Heald was obliged to come north on sick leave, and the command ot' ves. sel and chargfl of the work was temporarily assigned to Lieut. G. C. Hanus, U. S.

Mr. Halter arrived at J>oint Isabel, Brazos Santiago, about the middle of November, and as soon as the weather permitted began bis reconnaissance. Much difficulty was experienced in recovering the points of the old tliangulation, some of them having no underground marks, and the snrfaee marks having either entirely disappeared or nearly rotted away. Having recovered stations Frontier (near the light-house), Massena, and Cameron, the reconnaissance was started from the Hoe Frontier-Cameron, and by tht el0t1t1 of the seaeon in February~ 1884, it had been carried to Brownsville.

Survey of the coast of California between San Diego and Newport.-At the beginning of the fiscal year Assistant A. F. Rodgers was on duty connected with the primary triangulation of the ·north coast of California. In August, 1883, he was instructe1l to proceed t.o Washington for special dut:r, and on his return to California made arrangements for closing operations on the north coast in accordance with directions to that effect. Having visited the primary stations Bear Ridge and Mud Ri>er in order to secure reference marks for future use, and stored the instruments of the north coast survey in the suboffice at San Francisco, l\fr. Rodgers made preparations for work in the new field to which he was assigned-the filling up of the gap in secondary triangulation and topography on the Pacific coast betwei:m San Diego and Newport, Cal. This work, it had been arranged, should be begnn in the vicinity of San Juan Capistrano, Los Angeles County, but before taking it up Mr. Rodgers was instructed to determine the geographical position of the magnetic observatory at Los Angeles, to the north of Newport. For this purpose the stations occupied were West Beach, Dominguez, and I,os Cerritos, these being the most aYailahle ones within a circle of twent:r miles from the obsen·atory. Signals were erected upon the observatory and upon the tower of the State Normal School, and pointings made upon these and upon all prominent spires, towers, &c., in the city of Los Angeles a.ud \·icinit~·. .Mr. Rodgers then returned to San Francisco, made the computations of this field-work, and forwarded a summary of the results to the office. On the 5th of Februar:r, the organization of his party for the southern work having been completed, he sent forward the men ancl animals to San Pedro by steamer; but the winter, which up to that date had been very light, started in with a succession of rain storms which for several weeks completely blocked travel by the county roads an<l made rail transportation for the part~ necessary t.o Santa Ana; from thence to Han ,Jurm evt>n the twenty· ti Vt> mile.s remaining- wNe traversed with some difficulty. Mr. Rodgers' owu movements were delayetl up to the 8th of March by a continuance of rain Rtorms which entirely 8t.opped travel from Los Angeles, where he had arrived on the 3d instant. Railroad bridges were washf\d away and strtg-e road8 rendered impassable by swollen streams. On the 11th of March he reached San ,Tuan Capist.n1no and immediately began work by meas· uring a base in San .Juan Valley and occupying stations in the triangulation. Two topographical sheets were projected, each on a scale of 1-100001 and extending from a point five miles west of San Juan Capistrano anchorage to Point San Mateo, nine miles to the southward. The shore-line on these sheets was delineated and the relative position of objects on shore determined so as to furnish the means for a hydrographic examination of the offing and approaches to San .Tuan Capistrano. Field operations were suspended in .Tune.

observatory at Los Angeles, Cal., arnl placed in charge of Mr. Marcus Baker, Acting Assistant, was continued under his direction during the past fiscal year. This work is twofold in character, and consists of month!~· determinations on three consecutive days of the absolute declination, dip, and horizontal force, and a continuous regh1try by photography (with the Adie magnetographs) of the changes of declination and vertical and horizontal force. The absolute measures were made throughout the year without interruption, the results were deduced, the records duplicated, and full special abstracts were prepared and transmitted to the office. In connection with these absolute measures, a redetermination was made of the astronom· ical azimuth to obtain a true meridian line of reference for the magnetic declination, and special observations for constants hitherto undetermined were made. Notable among these was the determination of the induction coefficient of the intensity magnet, by the aid of a simple apparatus devised at the obserrn.tury. All of the results of preceding years were revised, so that all the declinations are now referred to the same azimuth, while the results for intensity depend on the same set of constants throughout. The record of variations of the earth's magnetic force was made as nearl~· continuous as pos· sible by the processes of photography. Great and constant care was taken to produce traces of the highest standard. These efforts were not so successful as during the year before, owing to causes beyond the control of the director. One of these was a settling of the foundations of the piers, resulting in a weakening of the luminous dots and in a slow impairment of the adjustments. This was due to a softening of the adobe soil, produced by a phenomenal rainfall, entirely-without precedent in Los Angeles anll Yicinity, which visited that town in February, 1884. Other causes were the impossibility of obtaining 1mitably distilled water for observatory use at various times during the last four months of the fiscal year, and the necessity of training new assistants in the photographic work. The total loss of record from all causes during the year was, however, very small, amounting to but seven.tenths of one per cent. A thermograph record was kept uninterruptedly throughout the year wit_l1in the observatory, the temperature curve for each day being shown upon a separate sheet. Equal altitudes of the sun were obst>rved each month with sextant and artificial horizon for the determination of the local time. l\1r. Lucius Baker aided in the observatory work till the end of February, 1884, when he resigned, and temporar,v assistance was obtained till .l\Iarch, when Mr. P. A. \.Yelker, Aid, was assigned to duty, remaining till the close of the fiscal .rear. l\Ir. Carlisle Terry, jr., Aid, was ordered t-0 report at the observatory for duty in April, and familiarized himself with the instruments and methods, with the understanding that be should take charge of the work when Mr. Baker's request to be relieved could be granted.

find most favorable for obtaining the most satisfactory results. Keeping watch on the condition of the atmosphere, he made arrangements earl~· in October for the occupation of San Luis station, in San Luis Obispo County, Cal., a point about eighteen miles from the coast and having an elevation of three thousand feet. The opening of a trail up the mountain, pitching camp, building of a pier for the instrument, and other preliminary operations having been completed, observations were begun November 9 and closed December 7. The horizontal directions of six primary and two tertiar~- stations were determined, the latter for the purpose of connecting the tertiary triangulation at Esteros Bay with the main series. Observations were also obtained on Piedras Blancas light-house. To do this, a ridge about a mile distaut from San Luis station had to be cleared of every Yestige of shrubbery near the line of sight, and a ledge of rocks removed by giant powder, so nearly tangent to this ridge did the line of vision to the light-house tower pass. Pointiugs were also taken on all promiueut hilhi and objects within the range of view from the station. The heights of five primar~- stations were determined by observations of double zenith distances. The next Ntation occupied was San Jose, a peak in San Luis Obispo County, distant about thirty-one miles from the coast, and having an elevation of thirty-seven hundred fe.et. Here, as at San Luis, camp was pitched on the south face of the mountain to obtain a shelter from the strong north and east winds coming from the Sierras a~ross the great valley of California. At San Jose, between January 1 and January 19, observations were made on six primary stations, and pointiugs taken on all prominent hills and objects, including thirty-three peaks in the Sierras. Measures of double zenith distances were made on all main stations and prominent peaks. The occupation of Saddle Peak, a mountain of forty-seven hundred feet elevation, within about five miles of the coast, followed next. This peak and Castle Mountain, a prominent elevation of the coast range and one of the points of the main 8eries were not intervi8ible, but the peak was occupied because it had been observed upon in connection with the tertiary triangulation, though it was not included in the primary scheme. Seven stations were observed from Saddle Peak. It had been intended by ANsistant Lawson to occupy Rocky Butte, a primary station of thirty. four hundred feet elevation near the coast, but while the wagons were en route a violent storm of rain began, which for long duration and amount proved to be unprecedented in that region. Bridges were carried away and roads rendered impassable by deep mud and overflows of water from five to ten feet in depth. Having waited until the middle of February, aD:d seeing no prospect of moviug forward, Mr. Lawson disbanded his party and returned to San .Francisco to complete the records and results of the season. In his report he expresses his high appreciation of the value of the services of Mr. P. A. Welker, who was attached to his party as Aid.

Sun.'ey of the coast of Oalifornia between Moro Bay and San Simeon Bay.-Having in accordance with instructions proceeded to Santa Barbara, Cal., to receive and store certain property of the Survey, Assistant Stehman Forney, on completing that duty, was assigned to the charge of the tertiary triangulation and topography of the coast between Moro and Sau Simeon Bays. Having established his party near Cayucos, convenient to his field of work, .Ur. Forney took up the triangulation from the line Beach-Chaparral to the southward of Moro Bay and carried it fifteen miles up the coast, to the line Villa-Stone, near Estero Point. The shore-line in the vicinity of Moro Bay was delineated on two topographical sheets, also the contour lines and all fences, houses, &c., including the towns of Cayucos and· Moro, within a belt of one and a half miles from the shore. There is much topographical detail immediately on the coast from Moro Bay to Cambria, the contouring being intricate, and the land being cut up into dairy farms, varying from one hundred to one thousand acres. These farms are all divided by fences with roads leading to the dwelling-houses. Field operations were· closed February 29. Between that date and June 2, when the work in

Hydro_qraphic .9urvey in the vicinity of Point Buchan, Cal., wid examination of bar at entrance to San Francisco Bay.-In continuation of the inshore hydrography of the coast of California from San Luis Obi8po Bay northward, Lieut. E. D. Taussig, U. S. :X., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, left San Francisco, January 30, 1884, with his party on board the steamer McArthur, and on reaching Port Harford, Sau Luis Bay, prepared to execute the hydrography in that locality. A plane of reference for the soundings was obtained by deducing the mean of lower low waters from obsernttious made bPtwePn February 13 and l\Iay 10 ou a tide-staff established at the wharf at Moro Bay, San Luis Obispo Uounty. Soundings were begun February 21 and completed May 10 to beyond Ca~·ucos, which is the extreme northern part of Estero Bay. Lieuterntut Taussig's report gives full details in regard to the hydrographic characteristics of the localities sounded, and the notes he has made will he of much value in the preparation of the new edition of the Pacific Coast Pilot. Some extracts from his report are here given: "Port Harford, as a summer anchorage, is very good. The north west wind does not come home, as a rule, and there is generally a calm and perfectly smooth sea inside the reef, while on tside there may be a strong northwest wind and heavy sea. In the wint~r months there is generall~- a swell setting in, which at times breaks off the end of the wharf in four-fathom water. But the holding-ground is good, and the McArthur lay out at lier anchors six southeasters in February and l\Iarch. To the northwest of the reef, clm;e under the bluffs and the inner inlet, the sea is smoother and the wind harmle;:;s as a rule, but there is little room for working ship in case of accident or of iLll emergenc.L A sailing \·essel could not get out of the uight in the face of a strong southeaster. At times, but rarely, a strong norther blows, which rushes down the hills with the suddenness and nearly the velocity of the 'willy-waughs' of the Straits of Magellan, and would be apt to e<tnse a vessel to snap her chain." There is frequently a strong undertow at the wharf. A red nun-buoy No. 2 has been placed in ten fathoms of water off the fourteen.foot rock which lies about a mile to northward and eastward of the reef. "There is genemll.v a heavy sea off Point Bnchon, and the reef extends half a mile to seaward. There is deep water near the point; but there are so many rocks about, that vessels should give the point a good offing. Point Buchon is the point ha,·iug the longest reef extending from it-the point with the fiat-topped bluff, not the bluff which has a hump on it. ''At Point Buchou the land turns sharply to NN.FJ. for two miles, forming the uorthwesteru face of Mount Buchon, the bluff.~ being jagged aud rocky. Thick kelp is found for half a mile off shore along the whole two miles. The land then turns and cnrYes to the north and west, the high }and recedes, and the shore-line thence for about seven miles is a sand beach, broken by Moro Rock and the entrance to Moro Bay. ''Moro Bay is a lagoon emptying into Estero Bay. The entrance is to the northwest of Moro Rock and Pillar Ro0k; the latter is the rock just clear of ~foro Rock to the west. Light-draught vesselR enter with the flood tide. The channel is narrow, and changes more or less each tide. It generally breaks at the entrance with the ebb tide running. The tides run through the entrance with great velocity. Vessels drawing eleven feet have gone in and come out. There is a strong probal>ility of t-0uching, even with a pilot 011 board, and vessels entering may have to wait some time for ~ fll,vorable tide. The need of a good harbor is great in this section of the country, and

UNITED STATES OOAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

61

it was a disappointment to me that I could not use it as au anchorage for the ~lcArthur. Abo"Ve the wharf the greater part of the bay is more or less bari· at low water. No vessel shoulrl enter without a pilot. "Cayucos is a passable summer anchorage, uut a daugcro1rn one in wintrr. Vessels should leave as soon as a southeaster hegins, and whenever a southwest swell rolls in. "The rapid development of San Luis Obispo Uonnt,,·, the growing commerce of the city of San Luis Obispo, and the lack of any harbor of refuge from winter storms between ::\Ionterey aud Wilmington, will before many ,vears demand the construction of a sufficient breakwater at Port Harford to enable vessels to remain there at any time of the ,\'('ar.'' Lieutenant Taussig's bydrographic work off the coast of Sau Luis Obi:-<JH1 Count.'· is comprised in six hydrograpbic sheets on a scale of 1-10000. Upon comple'ting this work early in the month of 3ia.v, 11'$"51, J,it>nt'enant Tan~sig received instructions to make an examination of the lmr at the entranee of Sau Fra11cisco Bay.

Connection of the main triangula.tion north of' Point Concepcion irit!i the transeontincntal triangulation near the thirty·ninth parallel.-A condensed report has been submitted by Assistant George Davidson of the main triangulation and astronomical work iu California, under bis direction, and of other work of himself and party. Mr. Davidson delayed putting his party in the field until the fogt' of summer had gone aud the prospect of grass for the draft animals good. He placed Assistant E. F. Dickins in charge of the party, with Mr. R A. Marr as Aid. At first the season was favorable, but later on the rains were ;-ery heavy aud retarded operations. Nevertheless: as Mr. Davidson remarks, the winter is the best time in that climate for gettiug a clear and steady atmosphere. The heliotropes alwa~·s show as minute steady points of light like stars, whereas in summer they are large, ill defined, and very uustead~- objects. The plan of work embraced the occupation of seYeral main triangulation stations 011 the seaboard, in the regular scheme of triangles and observations upon I~ed Hill arnl Hocky )found, stations to the eastward of San Francisco Bay, to bring to a close the connection of the present system with the Pulgas base, measured by Assistant Cutts. A doubt having arisen whether the line Sierra Morena-Loma Prieta (or Monut lfache) was intervisible, a reconnaissance was undertaken by Assistant ,T. S. Law8on, in ,Jul,v and August, under Mr. Davidson's direction, to settle this and Rimilar questions as to statious iu the main 15cheme southward to San Luis Obispo. The intervisibility of the two stations just named was established and the line has since been observed. The stations Saddle Peak and San ,J osu were found to be iutervisible over an intervening ridge by a very few feet. A high mountain ten or fifteen mile!< southeast of Santa Ana was found to be unavailable, and the old station of Santa Ana, insteall of Mariposa Peak, was subsequently taken by Assist;tut Dickins in thick weather. The old station, Salinas Mountain, not before observed upon however, was found t.o be 1\Iount Toro, and this latter name is used. As the work of occupation of the stations was undertaken in winter, a small but was built over each station, instead of using an observing tent as a protection against southeast gales.

During December and January Mr. Dickins occupied Sierm .:\Iorena, a mountain about twenty miles north of San Francisco, and obsen'ed upon the mountains, Tamai pa is, Diablo, Mocho; and Loma Prieta (or Mount Bache). Incidentally al:so upon .Mount Hamilton (Lick Ob:,;ervatory) and upon the secondary stations Rocky "'.\found and Hed Hill; also upon the Southeast Farallon light and San .Jo:,;e court-house. Tlle obsen'ations were made with the twenty-inch theodolite No. 115, mounted on a brick pier with the Davidson position circle. The series embraced two direct and two reversed observations in each of the twenty-three positions of the instrument. The ocular micrometer was used, after the micrometers were read, to correct the telescope pointings. In this work five hundred and eighty-two observations were made and twenty-eight hundred and sixty-seven ocular micrometer readings. The field reductions were kept up to date, and subsequently the diminished measures were com· puted and transmitted to the office with the Yolumes of records. Mr. R. A. l\farr, Aid in the party, made the measurements of the wrtical angles with the twelveinch vertical circle No. 111. Observations were made upon the same stations that were observed for horizontal directions, through thirteen days and between midday and 1 Jl. m. ~<\.s the work progressed, the reductwns and tabulations were made, and from the snboflice these reductions and the recortl:s were afterwards transmitted to Washington. In tliis work the number of observations was four hundred and eighty. Hed Hill, up which a line of levels had been carried by Assistant Uutts, will be occupied for measurements of reciprocal zenith distances. ::\fagnetic observations for declination and lwrizoutal force were made throngh three and six days u.r .:\:Ir. Marr. lie wade also the 11ecessary time obtlervatious witli the sextant and artificial horizon. The tramifer of the party from Sierra l\forena to Loma Prieta (or Mount Bache) was made in YerJ' bad weather, and had to be done by a circuitous route. A trail favorable for packing had to be cut out for several miles. During this work by Mr. l\farr, Assistant Dickins visited Toro Mountain aud Santa Ana and posted heliotropers. The snow was deep at tliese peaks as well as at Mount Baclle. At thi:,; station, a few miles north of Santa Cruz, and thirty-eight hundred feet above the sea, .:\lr. Marr built the necessary stone and cement piers. The twenty-inch theodolite No. 115 was mounted 011 one of the piers, which had secured to it a Da\'idson position circle. Assistant Dickim1 observed upon the ti rn main stations, l\focho, Santa Ana, Toro, Diablo, and Sierra Morena; incidentally upon .Mount Hamilton, the San Jose court-house, Santa Cruz light . hom;e, and Gilroy church. The, observation:,; were made in the usual manner with ocular micrometer readings, two readings direct and two reversed being taken in each of the twenty-three positions of the instrument. ln thi:,; work four hundred and ninety-six observations were made and fourteen hundred and ninetytwo ocular micrometer readings. At this stat10n, althougli the observations of horizontal directions were not completely finished, owing to waut of fulllh1, yet they were so nearly finished, and the results were obtained under 1mch farnrable circumstances of weathef, that they may be safely taken as final. The records and reduction8 were completed and transmitted to the office. Obs11rvations of vertical angles were made by Mr. Marr with vertical circle No. 111, upon the same stations a:,; those observed by Assistant Dickins. The number of observations was three hundred and thirty-six. Mr. Marr determined the magnetic declination aud horizontal force on three and six days, and made the necessary time obser\'ations. At the end of March, 1884, field operations were closed, and the party was employed in office duty. During the year Assistant Dickins was directed to make observations upon Lime Pofnt steam fog-horn from two or three tertiary triangulation stations to determine its position. He was detached from Mr. DaYidson'ti party May 33, 1884. Special magnetic observations.-During a short trip to Mexico, Assistant Davidson was able to observe the magnetic declination at El Paso, in Texas, and at the National Observatory a.t Ta.cu·

Observation.~ of the solar eclipse of October 30, 1883.-0n the 30th of October :Mr. Davi<losn observed the first contact of the solar eclipse of that date, at the Davidson Observatory in San Francisco, and arranged telescopes for all officers who wished to observe it. He used the full aperture of bis six and four-tenths ineh equatorial, with an Airy double-image micrometer, carr_ying a power of two hundred and forty diameters. For obtaining the error of the chronometer, transits were observed by Mr. C. B. Hill hefoo-e and after the eclipse, and comparisons of chronomet~rs by coincidences were made after it. Mr. Daddson remarks that the border of the sun was unsteady, and the unsteadiness increased till the time of :;reatest obscuration, which took place t.bree minutes before the sun set below the ocean horizon. At that time, the boiling of the borders of the sun awl moou was excessh·e, and the refraction wru1 so grnat that the images of the two bodies, as far as visible, were remarkably flattened, aucl the cusps presented a Tery singular and abnormal appearance. The station of observation is 011 .37 soutll and 0".21 east of the triangulation station Lafayette Park.

On acconut of the mass of details ou the southern portion, much of it bad to be rewritten. The portion relating to that part of t11e coast from San Diego to San Francisco waR completed. To get special views of headlands, and to make notes of sailing directions, '.\lr. FPrdiua11d Westdahl was directed to make two trips down the c-0ast. Mr. Davidson visited penmnally the Farallones for views, and "Mr. \Yestdahl the Cordell Bank, but tlie weather was foggy on both occasions. Mr. Davidson was summoned to vVashington in June, 1884, for special conference with me relatiug to the interests of the work as affected by measures pending in Congress. On ltis rt>tnrn trip in July, be attewled to special duty in Philadelphia, and while crossing the continent studit>d the coroparatiYe advantages and disadvantages of the 35tb parallel re1atiwl~· to the 32d for tram;continental geodetic work. During the year the observatory at I1afayette 1~ark wai.; m'<ed b~- the members of Mr. Da\'idsou's party for practice with the different instruments, and at the request of ~faj. \Y. A .·Tones, U. S. Engineers, stationed at the Presidio of San l<'ranci.sco, arrangements were made for a joint determination of the difference of longitude between the Lafayette Park station and stations at Needle::; (Mohave) and Fort Yuma, Ariz. At Lafayette Park. in Mr. Davidson's absence at Washington, the observations were made by Mr. Marr, assisted by Mr. Hill. Transits for time were observed upon nine night8 between May 26 and.,June 27. Owing to exceedingly inclement weather, and an

accident to the transit instrument at the Needles, exchanges were obtained upon two nights only with that station, and on one ni~h t \Yi th Yuma. Other operations directed by Assistant Davidson, or carried on by his aid and advice, are referred to in the paragraphs immediately following. Tidal obsermtions 1cith setf'.registering tide-gau,ge continued at Saucelito near San Francisco Bay entrance.-The self-registering tide-gauge record at Saucelito, near San Francisco Bay entrance was ke11t up, almost without i11terruptiou by l\Ir. E. Gray, under Assistant Davidson's general supervision,_ The usual talmlatiom: were made at the end of each month, and were forwarded to Washington before the trausmission of the records. The eartliquake wa,·es from the ,-olcauic eruption at Krakatoa off the coast of Java, August jll, 1883, were reeorded upon the Saucelito tide-gauge a tew hours after that event, and the fact was published before an;\- notice of the earthquake had been made public. The record shows that the eartlH1uake wavt>s may luwe come through several tracks to this station. ])eten11inations <~f the J(1rc1' nf grarity in San F1·ancisco, in connection with similar observations in Alaska_-Heterenef' was mn1le in m:.- last annual report to the dispatch of Mr. R. A. Marr, Acting Assistant, to Point Barrow, AlHska, in furtherance of the plans initiated during the preceding year, in virtue of wt1id1 tlll' Coast arnl Geodetic Survey co-operated with the Signal Service in establisbi11g a station of the International Polar Commission at Point Barrow. Having swung his pendulum and vibrated his magnet at tbe San Francisco station, selected by Assistant Davidson, J\lr. ::\larr left Sau Francisco, ,Tune 16, 1883, on the schooner Leo, and on the :35th of July, reacheu Plover Ba,\. Eastern SilJeria. Here he got a few pointings on the sun for time, and leaviug ou the 27th, the I,eo ran along the Siberian coast north of East Cape, and then crossed to the American side to Point Hope and Cape Thompson. Augusts, the first ice was sighted south of Icy Cape; on the Uth the vessel anchored off Wainwright Inlet near a portion of the wlrnliug tieet, after tr,ving to push through the ice and around Point Belcher. There was open water be~·nwl tlw Sea Horse lslands. The ice-pack proper was distinctly visible from tJrn anchorage, and forme1l appareutly like that laid 1lown on the chart for ·'July, 1849." The whalers bad followed tlw ice from Behriug's Straitl'l, and reported a severe season since entering the Arctic. The Leo was co11tinuall,Y shifting position to avoid ice-floes moving to northeast. At times there was a two-knot current, and once ice was noticed moving against a light wind. Several attempts were made to get around Poiut BelclH'l': two small schooners succeeded in finding an opening. Mr. Marr went aslwn~ sen·ral times "·ith a vi('W of establishing a st.ation at Point Belcher, should the vessel be unalJ!e to get through the ice. Angmit !!O Liente11ant Ray of the Signal Service, commanding the expedition, reported open water off Sea Hor,;c h;lands, and no shore ice off Ooglaamie, Point Barrow. August 22, the vessel was anchore1l off Ooglaamie. Between tlie !!~I and !!;Ith, haviug overcome the various difficulties presented by heavy surf and ti.Jc closing in of the sit ore ice, ..\Ir. l\Iarr effected a landing with his instruments and outfit, and, having availed himsl'lf of a building placed at his disposal by Lieutenant Ray, built a pier for the pendulum staJHl, mouuted his chronograph, and expected to begin observations on the morning of the 27th. But the conditions of the ice and weather on that day, together with au accident to the vessel, led Lieuteuant Hay to decide upon an immediate abandonment of the station, and as he did not (leem it safe that Mr. l\Iarr should remain with but one man during the winter, the latter was compelled1 though very reluctantly, to i;:i\-e up the attempt to make the desired observations. Two or three days more, or until September 1, at the latest, would have enabled him to get the pendulum swings needed for comparison with those at San Francisco. Mr. Marr reports that after leaving Point Barrow, tht>y did not pass any iee, and that they had good \Veather. On the return Yoyage, observations for magnetic declination and horizontal force were made on two days at Ooualashka. Mr. Marr ha~ expressrd bis willingness to remain through the winter at Point Barrow, should another opportuuity offer of obtaiuiug the needed observations. He acknowledges bis indebtedneis to Mr. A. D. Scl.Jindler, who accompanied him on the expedition, for useful assistance.

Survey of Shlslaw River entrance, a.nd continuation of the triangulation nnd topography of Utnp. quah Riter, Oreg.-lnstrnctions issued to Assistant Louis A. Sengteller soon after the beginning of the fiscal year directed him to take charge of the schooner Yukon, then laid up at the Mare Island ua,·y-yard, Cal., and, after fitting her for sea-serviee, to organize a party for a topographic and hydrographic r(·cormaissance of the Siuslaw H.iver, and for the continuation of the triangulation and topography of the Umpquab River, Oreg. On July :n, repairs havfng been made and outfit completed, the Yukon was dispatched to sea, in charge of t!Je sailing-master, who had receiYe<l orders from Mr. Sengteller to enter Siuslaw River and pass out again in the Yukon if be should find it practicable to do so; and if not, to make sail for Umpquah River entrance. Owing· to a successiou of calms, alternating with very high head winds, the vessel made but slow progress. August 13, with a light but fair wind, the Yukon ran close in to shore in the vicinity of Siuslaw Rh'er, but could find nothing that would serve to identify the entrance, and as heavy fog began to drift in, the schooner was put to sea, and a course steered for Umpquah River, which was reached and the bar crossed August 15. J>lans were then arranged by Mr. Sengteller (who had remained at U mpquah River), to dispatch a surf-boat, with crew and provisions, by sea to Sinslaw River; the boat arrived and crossed the bar without mishap August 18, aud the next day Mr. Sengteller, who had proceeded overland, began bis reconnaissance. A site for a hase line having been selected, and triangulation statiom; located, the base was measured, and enough points having been determined in position, the topog-raphy aud l1_ydrography were begun August 23 and continued until the shore-line of the river, the topograph~' adjacent and the sonndings, had been completed from the entrance to the village of Florence, a settlement about tive miles from the coast. Such examinations of the bar and of its approaches as the weather permitted were made also. A beacon was erected, plainly visible from the bar, as a range mark for vessels attempting to enter Siuslaw River. Mr. Sengteller states, as a result of his examinations, that no definite sailing directions can be given for entering the river, owing to" possible constant shifting of the bar," and that on nearing the bar a vessel should uot approach nearer than five fathoms. Then, by bringing the beacon on the north bank of the riYer to bear north 75° east (magnetic), and about one nautical mile dista11t from the rnast-hea<l and in smooth water, the best water for crossing can only be located by au occasional lull iu the breakers. When these are at all rough, only a continuous line of surf is visible, and at such times it is dangNous to attempt an entrance. He recommends a buoy for marking the approach to the bar as given by the bearings to the beacon-a large can buoy to be dropped in not less than ten fathoms of water. To obtain with the least loss of time an authentic knowledge of entrances of this character along the coast of Oregon, and to meet the demands of a rapidly-growing section of the coast for greater facilities of trans1lortatiou seaward, he suggests that a light-draught steamer would be extremely serviceable.

Ou September 7 he proceeded thither in tlle Yukon, lea,·ing his sailing master with a boat'1-1 crew at the Siuslaw with instructions to cross the bar and join him at the Umpquah at the first fayorable opportunity. Owing to unfayor~lJle weather and the conditiou of the bar at Siuslaw River entrance, it eventually became necessary to transport the boflt and crew overland. Although progresi-; was somewhat impeded b,Y the absence of the crew, who did not return to the Umpquah till September '.!S, operations were pushed forward as rapidly as practicable, and the party continued in the field until October 6, when the funds aYailable for the work were exhausted. On the 11th of that month the Yukon left for San Francisco. Following is a summ:u,v of the statistics of the Umpquah RiYer work:

Sumey of Nestucca Bay and River, Oreg., and continuation of the triangulation and topography of the Willamette R-irer, wuZ of the topography of the Columbia River.-Iu compliance with instructions received early in Jnl,r, 1883, Assistant Cleveland Rockwell left Portland, Oreg., ,July 12, and on arriving at Nestucca Bay immediately organized a party for the survey of that bay and of the Big and Little Nestncca Rivers, by the junction of which it is formed. A base was measured, signals erecte1l at the points selected for stations of the triangulation, and a tide-gauge established to obtain a plane of reference for the soundings. Three days suffi·ed to finish the soundings inside of the entrance, as at low water the area is nearly covered by sand and mud fiats, and was surveyed with the plane-table. The triangulation aml topography were carefully executed, as forming part of the general coast work, and the survey was completed September 27. Mr. Rockwell remarks that the character of the country is mostly rolling and steep hills which have been long deuuded of timber and are now coYered by fern and grass. Forest fires since the settlement of the country by the whites have swept oYer the whole area from the coast back to the Willamette Valley, and the coast range of mountains presents from the ocean a desolate array of tall and bare white stumps aud trees. He observes also that there is every evidence that in former times tlrn Big Nestucca entered the ocean opposii:e Haystack Rock, but the drifting_ sand filled in the coast line, forming the longsand peninsula to the north of the entrance, and pushing the entrance to the two riYers down towards the rocky bluff to the south. Upon the bar there were continued breakers. Having no suitable boat or crew it was not practicable to make an examination of the bar. The heavy swell from the southwest which set in during the middle and latter part of August closed the bar nearly up, so that at low water, on viewing it from the bluff, the wl1ite water would roll across for a hundred yards or so. Shoal water extends a long distance outside, as shown by the heavy rollers. About the middle of October Mr. Rockwell was directe~ to take up the tertiary triangulation of the Willamette l~iver from its mouth up to Portland. This work bad heen begun in 1882. :Field operations were carried on till December l5, at which date all necessary third orcler points for the topography and hydrograpby of the Willamette from its mouth up to and beyond the cit~· of Port-

During the remainder of the winter and the spring Mr. Rockwell was engaged upon officework, and in l\Ia~-, 1884, he was instructed to resume the topographical survey of t11e Columbia arnl \YillamettP }{ivers. For a short time he wa8 engaged upon the low shores of the two rivers, hut as thP water steadily rose, covering- all tl1e ;;hore-line and interior topography, he moved the \·ei,;spl up thP \\'1llamPtte~ and took np work 011 such part!' of the country a;; were abO\·e water, being- oblige(l to lean~ the (lt>lineation of the actual shore-line until the water should snhside. At the end of the fiscal ,Yt>ar lw wa;; prosecnting- the R1uvey near the city of Portland. Hpclrog1·aphfo snn·eys (!( Oray's Harbor and in the Ticinity of 8ealm~k, 1V. T.-.As Rtatefl in my last annual report, a liy<lrographic survey of Gra.r's Harbor, \Y. T., had been begun before the close of the fiscal year h,\· the party iu charg-e of Lieut. T. Dix Bolles, U.S. :N'., .Assistant Coast aud Georletic Sun·py, commanding tbe Rcbooner Earnest. Some difficulty was ex1wrienced in fixing a tide-gauge, tl1ree having been washed away in succession, owing to the extensi\·e mud fiats and strong, rnshi11g currents. One was finally established in Soutll R1y, near the entrance. This was a plain staff-gauge, and was observed day and night for a lunar month. As the plane of reference for 8ouudings the mean of the firn lowest low waters was taken. A secondary ti!lp staff was set up at Hoquiam, and the plane of refer· Pnce for the upper bay was computed bs the Coast Surwy rules for water levels. A benchmark wa8 establisl1e<1 on Nettle Island, in South Bay, fourteen fret and eight-tenths above the plane of reference. In regard to the locality of the work the following details are given in the reports of Lieutenant Bolles and Ensign .Jordan, wl10 succeeded him in charge of the party: The inside harbor consists of an exknsive mud and san<l fiat, with a channel running up the middle to the Hoquiam and Chehalis Hivers, and an arm extending into North and South Bays, near the entrance. From each of these, numerous blind sloughs lel,td off into the fiats. The three channels have from three and a half to eight fathoms in the lower bay, gradually shoaling to from nine to twelYe feet a8 they extend north, east, and south. There is another channel from the Cllehalis River, on the south side of the bay, but a sand-bar at the mouth prevents more than fh'e or six feet being carried into it. The bar outside is from three to four miles off shore, with ten feet on it at low water. Exten. sive i;hoals make oft' from the north and sontb sides of the entrance, and are distinctly marked by breakers even with a moderate sea. The water deepens inside the har to eighteen fathoms between the points. There is a very strong current during the ebb and flow of the tide, aud an ugly chop sea at the entrance during the ebb, making it very dangerous work for a boat. During the summer months the northwest winlls blow steadily every afternoou, and the northwest swell breaks clear across the bar. There are but few places on the shore where a landing can be made at low water, on account of verJ· Roft mud fiats extending off from one-third of a mile to over three miles. Two hydrographic sheets were completed each on a scale of 1-20000, extending from the mouth of the Chehalie River to four miles off shore, and including the whole of Gray's Harbor and Bar. The statistics of the work, which was closed October 15, are as follows:

During July and most of August l\fr. Gilbert reports that progreRR was greatly impeded hy the unusually dense smoke from tlie foreHt fireH. After the rains of late August and early September bad cleared the atmosphere, the weather continnec1 Yer.Y favorabh· for work until about the middle of November, when the winter rains fWt iu. On Non1mber 19, the weather being stormy, with a prospect of continuing so for au irn\etinite period, tield operations were closeu. After some needed repairs the Puca w~ts laid np at Port Town;;eud. During the winter and early spring )fr. Gilbert was at work upon his plane-table sheets: fh'e in number. Tracings of these were forwarded to Washington .March IO, aud the sheets themselns April 15. Finding that the allotment of fund8 as _yet unexpended would enable him to take the field early in May, he left Olympia May 5, Rtoppiug on the way at Tacoma for coal for the launch, and at Seattle for coal and outfit. Camp was establii,;bed at UniOll City, and field work begun Ma:i· 15. One week in May was devoted· to triangulation. ·with that exception, the two field 8eaRons during the Ji8cal year were occupied witl1 topography. During May and the early part of .Tune the weather was ,·ery f~worab!e, hut the last two weeks in ,Tuue were unusually stormy. The shore-line and topograph;\·, 1tt the close of the tiscal year, had been extended from 8tation Drift, on the east side of Hood's Canal, and from station Hock IT, on the west side, to station Arrow on the east and station Windfall on the west, including all of Dabop and Qualcine Bays. Contours, as is unavoidable on thei.:;e 11hores, are principally sketched, but the sketching iR aRsisted wherever practicable by running a line of contours straight back from the shore-line. All logging roads were taken ad vantage of for this purpose, and additional lines run at intervals wherenw the forest was not too dense to be penetrated. Two additional topographic sheets were in baud at the close of the fiscal year, making seven sheets in all.

upon his arrival there, toward the end of that month, took charge of the schooner Yukon to pre· pare her for service on Possession Sound. The needed repairs having been completed, the Yukon sailed from San Francisco May 14, and arrived at Seattle, W. T., May 28, and a few days later was in Possession Sound. The month of June was occupied by Mr. Pratt in a reconnaissance, the erection of signals and the occupation of stations for the triangulation of the sound. Eight stations bad been occupied lw the end of the month, and observations were still in progrpss at the close of the fiscal year. A full statement of the work accomplished during the season h; necessarily deferred till my next annual report. Other duty executed b;y Mr. Pratt is referred to under the heading of Section

XIII. Triangulation and topogmphy of the Strait of Fuca.-Early in June, 1884, Assistant B. A. Colonna arrived at Port Townsend, ·w. T., in pursuance of instructions directing him to execute
the triangulation and topography of the Strait of Fuca. After familiarizing himself with the locality, he bad well advanced the preparations needed to take up the work by the end of the year with which this report closes. Duty on the Atlantic coast which bad been assigned to Mr. Colonna earlier in the fiscal year is referred to under the beading of Sectiou VI. Hydrographic suriiey of the Strait ~t' Fuca.-The steamer Hassler which liad been in service for some years on the coasts of Alaska, and had been laid up for repail's at the Mare Island navy-yard during the winter of 1883-'84, was placed under the command of Lieut. Commander A. S. Snow, U. S. N., iu the spring of 1884, and that officer was directed to organize a party for the hydrographic survey of the Strait of Juan de Fnca. The Hassler left San Francisco May 16, 1884, and arrived at Esquimault, British Oolumbia, May 21. Having taken in coal at Departure Bay, and made otuer need fol prepit;ratious for the work, soundings were begun in the strait June 5, liues being run across it at intervals of two miles, and in depths varying from ten to one hundred and twelve fathoms. At the date at which this report closes a sufficient number of lines had not been run to justify any statemeutR respecting the hydrographic characteristics of the localit;r. Work was being pushed at every opportunity of favorable weather, the sheet in hand, on a scale of 1-80000, including au area extending from Whitbey Island to Pillar Point. The mean of lower low waters was adopted as a plane of reference for the soundings, to obtaiu which, observations of tides to be continued through one lunation were begun June 18, on a staff gauge established at New Duugeness. A similar gauge will be established at Port Angelos.

Hydrographic reconnaissance of the bays ana harbors of Southeastern Alaska, continucd.-At the beginning of the fiscal year, as mentioned in my last annual report, the surveys of the bays and harbors of Southeastern Alaska were being continued by Lieut. Commander H. E. Nichols, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, in charge of the bydrographic party on board the steamer Hassler. Lieutenant-Commander Nichols arrived in the Hassler at Port Simpson, May 16, 18831 and con· tinned his surveys until October 13 of that year, when the steamer left Port Simpson for San Francisco.

The results of his work are shown upon six hydrographic sheet,s, all of which, with the records accompanying, have been transmitted to the office. These six sheets include the hydrography of tlle following localif.ies in Southeastern Alaska: Cape Fox to Tree Point, Port Tongass, Port Chester, Tamgas Harbor, Cape Fox to Bold Island, May Island to Point Higgins. They will form the basis of charts of those localities, arrangements for the early publication of which are now being made. Lieutenant-Commander Nichols remained in command of the Hassler till March 6, 1884, when he was relieved by Lieut. Commander A. S. Snow. In the surve;vs of 1883 he was aided by the following-named officers: Lieut. G. Blocklinger, U. S. N., and Ensigns W. V. Bronaugh, F. M. Bostwick, J. H. Fillmore, and W. P. lVhite, U. S. N. Mr. Fremont Morse, .Aid in the Survey, served as astronomer to the party, and in a manner which called forth special commendation from his commanding officer. Mr. Morse was detached and ordered to other duty in December, 188;~. Tidal observations with selj-registcriug tide-gauge continued at Sahlt Paul, Kadiak Island, Alaska.The tidal records of Saint Paul, on the island of Kadiak, Alaska, lmve been well kept up, witll no stoppage, except from a change made in the location of the pier. Mr. W. J. Fisher was, as heretofore the observer. The self-registering gauge is on a wharf, recent!y rebuilt, of the Alaska Commercial Uomp .ny. The earthquake waves from the upheaval at Krakatoa in August, 1883, were registered 011 this gauge, as well as the one at Saucelito, San Francisco Bay entrance. Expedition to Point Barro1c, Alaska, for the purpose of determining grarity and the magnetic e/ements.-.An accouut has already been gh·en under the heading of Section X in this report of the results of the attempt made l1y Mr. R. A. l\1arr, ActiJJg .Assistant, to make determinations of gravity and tl1e magnetic elements at Point Barrow, Alaska, in execution of instructions issued in May, 1883, and in connection with similar determinations made in San Francisco. Although from circumstances entirely beyoud his control, and at a time when all preparatious for the observations had been completed, Mr. .Marr was obliged to leave Point Barrow without obtaining them, it is hoped that a future effort, made under more favoral>le auspices, will be successful.

Obseriiutions for latitude at stations not b1:fort' deterrnined.--At tbe beginning of the fiscal year the longitude parties under the direction of Assistant G. W. Dean and Subassistant F. H. Parso11s were occupying stations at Louisville, Ky., and Jellico, 'l'enn.; the station at Louisville being the point of reference for a series of longitude determinations to be made by Subassistants Parsons and Sinclair, i11 co-operation with Assistant Dean. At Jellico, 'renu., au astronomical i;tatiou was established h,\· Mr. Parsons, and connected with one of the mile-stones in the houuthtry line of Kentucky and Tennessee. Longitude signals were exchanged with the party of ;\fr. Deau at Louisville on the nights of .July 1, ~. and a; latitude observations were also mat.le 011 those nights. The next station occupied h~· ;\fr. Parsons was one at Richmond, Ky., in the grounds of the Kentucky Central Oollege, which was identical with the station occupietl some years ago by Professor Page in reconnaissance for .tri1tngulation. Lougitnde signals were exchanged with Louisville on July 9, 17, :uul 18. Au intended exchange on the 19th was prevented by the g-eneral strike of the Western U niou telegraph operators. Observations for latitude were made on six nights between the 7th anti 19th of .luly. It being apparent that the interruption occasioned by the Rtrike would continue for some time, Mr. Parsous proceeded to Louisville, aud obsel'ved there for personal equation with Mr. Carlisle Terry, jr., Aid in the Survey, who was attached to .l\Ir. Dean's party, and by whom the observations at Louisdlle were made. Before the persoual-equatiou work had begun, lio\1 ever, Mr. Dean's party exchanged signals

instructions received in July, 1883, Subassistant J. F. Pratt proceeded to Louisville, Ky., and took up the work begun there by Assistant G. A. Fairfield in 1879, and continued during parts of the years 1880, 1881, and 1882, by Acting Assistant Carl Schenk. :Mr. Pratt reached the working ground July 24, and having organizecl bis party, began operations by visiting stations Bangs, Williams, and Potts, on the Indiana border, and !Wey a11d ~fount Top in Kentucky, in order tofamiliarize himself with the country and place tbe signals in adjust· ment. The preliminary examination developed the following characteristics of the section of the State frmn Louisville to r,ebanon over which the triangulation was ultimawly carried. Along the east· ern side of Hardin aud La Rue and the northern side of Taylor Counties runs a long couti11uous ridge called l\Iultlraugh's Hill, which from the east appears as a range of I.Jill,., hut is practically a plate:m, the greater portion of which is cornred witll a large growth of timber. East of .M uldraugh's Hill, and extending as far east as the stations Riley, Jackson, White Lick, and Rohan (see sketch No. 15), the country is covered with timbered" knobs" averaging about three hundred feet in eleva· tion. Ea."'t of these points and as far as station "Jeptba," the country is rather high and rolling, but practically, for the purposes of triangulation, it is flat. The season was one of the driest known to the oldest inhabitants, and in consequence it was a very smoky one. On account of the nearly equal height of the knobs and the dense timber covering them, the reconnaissauce was very difficult,. aud had to be made almost entirel.v from the highest tree tops. It was carried over about one-half of the present scheme, and then the stations Riley, :\fount Top, Dobbius, and Jackson were occupied. The reconnaissance was then extended to the points Pen· nick and Spurling, and eight more stat.ions were occupied, the two last being Ferriell and Rohan. Two tripod and scaffold signals were erected in the course of the work, one of twenty-three feet at Burkett, the other of forty-five feet at Spurling. Field operations were closed December 15.

Continuation of the triangulation of the State of Tennessee.-As stated in my last annual report, the party of Prof. A. H. Buchanan, Acting Assistant, was in the field at the beginning of the fiscal year, engaged in erecting signals in continuation: of the triangulation of the State of T~nnessee. During July and the first week in August, four signals were erected, ·iz, "Copper Ridge" in Meigs County, "Owen")n Monroe County, "Oockspur" in Blount County, and "Brushy" in Morgan Ooun ty. The season was so exceedingly. unfavorable for observation by the smoky condition of the atmosphere that but one station was completed-Luper, eight and a half miles northwest of Rock· wood. From this point nine stations were observed. Field operations were closed October 30. The statistics of the work are as follows :

Oceupation of stations for the extension of the triangulation of the State of Oh·io.-The work of inspeetiug signals, and adjusting them in eontinuation of the triangulation of the State of Ohio, was begun early in July, 1883, by the party under the direction of Prof. R. S. Devol, Acting Assistant. Observations of horizontal angles were begun at McDaniel station, in Hocking County, July 9. After some days' trial it was found that, although the lines of sight were comparatively short, ranging from seven to twenty one or twenty-two miles, yet the condition of the atmosphere was such that heliotropes would be required for at least two of the stations. These having been placed in position, more rapid progress was assured. On July 24, a temporary interruption of the work was occasioned b.r a storm which prevailed over a wide area, and was specially violent in a narrow track across Townseiul Hill, where one of the signals bad been erected. The tripod and scaffold at this station were blown to the ground. By July 28 they had been put up again, and observations were continued at McDaniel station till August 4, when the work there was finished. The party was at once transferred to Townsend station, in Athens Oounty, a few miles sout.h of the town of Athens. At this point observations were begun August 6 and completed August 25, soon after which field operatious were closed. All records and results of the work, including barometer readings for the approximate determination of heights, have been transmitted to the office. Tbe statistics are as follows:

Reconnaissa.nce for the continuation of the triangulation of the State of Indiana.-The charge of the triangulation of the State of Indiana having been resumed by Prof. J. L. Campbell, in the winter of 1882-'83, as stated in my last annual report, he took the field for the continuation of the reconnaissance and triangulation in July, 1883. In the scheme of the work was involved the occupation of tbe stations "Sims" and "Bangs," the line joining which is the diagonal of a quadrilateral conuectiug with points in the survey of the State of Kentucky, and thus bringing these two State surveys iuto geodetic connection. The month of July was occupied by Professor Campbell's party in the final determination of the site for "Sims" in Clark County, the northeast station of the first quadrilateral, and the erection of a tri1JOd and tower at that station; the erection of a tripod and tower at the northeast station, "Six-Mile Switch," in Floyd County, and the establishment of permanent underground marks at both of those stations. In August and September observations were completed at stations "Sims" and ''Bangs," and between the 1st and 10th of October, field operations having been closed for the season, Professor Campbell verified the results of his work, and transmitted them with his report to the office. Special pains were taken in marking the two stations occupied to have both the underground and surface marks well Mecured. Descriptions of these markings accompany Professor Campbell's report. In June, 1884-, Professor Campbell began a reconnaissance for the extension of the triangulation northward from the limits of his work of the previous season. With reference to a proposed connection by odometer measurements with the railway system of Indiana., be reported in favor of beginning such measurements in the northern part of the State, where straight lines of from five to twenty miles iu length could be had, and one of eighty miles long. Connection could be made with the Lake Survey triangulation at the town of Mishawaka, Saint Joseph Oounty, and the work be carried over the railroads from South Bend. Protessor Campbell deems it very important establish a connection between the Coast and Geodetic Survey work in the State and its railroad

parallel had been advanced eastward by Assistant G. A.. Fairfield, whose party had been in the field since the middle of May, 1883. Station "Sturgess," near Vandalia,, had been occupied, and one of the stones marking the Third Principal Meridian of the General Land Survey had been connected with the triangulation. To make tlfrs connection, a base of more than a mile in length was twice measured with steel wire, and four secondary stations were occupied b.Y Mr. Isaac "Winston, Aid in the party. At the beginning of the fiscal year the part~' was established at~' Mound" station, near Altamont, Effingham County. Progress at this station was mnch interfered with by violent storms and heavy gales of wind, amounting in several ini>tances to almost ::i tornado. A section of the party under Mr. Winston's directions was engaged during .July and until the 10th of August in building tripod and scaffold signals in advance of the ouserving party. Three such signals were built during that time, one at " lsland Creek" station, eighty feet high; one at "Lucas" station, seventy-five feet high, and one at" ~ewton" station, forty feet high. On July 29, Assistant F. W. Perkins reported for duty, and remained attached to the party until October 30, when he was relieved, and left for Washington. "Holtzhausen" station, about fh-e miles southeast of Farina, ·Fayette County, was occupied bE>tween August 3 and 21. Camp was next moved to "Lucas" station, about ten miles east of Edgewood, Effingham County, where observations were begun August 26 and finished September ;~. The next station occupied was "Island Creek," about twelve miles t-0 the eastward of" Effingham," the county seat of Effingham County. Observations at this station were begun September 9 and completed SeptemlJer 25, when the party was transferred to station "Newton," about four miles south of the town of that name, in Jasper Count_y. Preparations for ohseffing were completed October 2. This being an astronomical station, observations for time, latitude, and azimuth were made, as well as those for horizontal direction. The observations for time and latitude were made by Mr. Perkins, and completed October 29. l\fr. Fairfield, having finished the observations of horizontal direction, began those for time and azimuth October 30 and completed them November 6. On the 9th of November, camp was moved to Denver station, about ten miles northwest of the town of Olney, Richland County, where observations were begun November 12. Some delay was caused at this station by the breaking of the signal light at Holtzhausen station, and by the necessity of opening a line between Denver and Lucas stations, and building a higher signal at "Island Creek." The work at Deuver was finished December 2, and on the 12th field operations were closed, seven primary stations and four secondar_y having been occupied. Assistant Fairfield ha8 made special reference in his report to the value of the services rendered in the work by .Assistant F. W. Perkins; he acknowledges also the ready and active co.operation of Mr. Isaac Winston, Aid in the party. Mr. J. L. Harper served acceptably as recorder.

Illinois, in which was located the base measured for connecting the triangulation with one of the priucip.tl meridians of tue Lantl Survey, decided to mark the base ends permanently by suitable stone monuments. These monuments were furnished by the county, under the direction of the Board of Supervisors, and placed in position by the county engineer. In March, 1884, upon application made by a committee of the Board, Mr. Fairfield, with my approval, communicated to the Board the geographical positions of the monuments at North Base and South Base. These monu. ments will thus be of ·alue as reference marks for future sul'\'eys. In June, 18.'!4, Mr. l<'airtfehl took the fieltl in order to make the necessary preparations for resuming the work at the earliest period that the appropriation for it should be available. During that month his party were t)CCnpied in building 8iguals. Detenninntion of the longitude of Lo,qansport, Ind.; and of Chicago, Ill., by exclw1iges of telegraphic signals u-ith Loui.~ville, Ky. Observations, also, for the ltititudes of Logansport and Chicago.A full statement has already been made under the heading of Section XIII of the dete.rminations of the longitudeA of Logansport, Ind., and Chicago, 111., by exchanges of telegraphic signals with a station at Louisville. The observations at Louisville were conducted by A8sistant G. W. Dean, with fhe aid of l\Ir. Carlisle Terry, jr., obeerrnr in his party; those at Logansport were made by Snbasisistant F. H. Parsons, with the aid of Acting Aissistant Carl Schenk. At Logansport and at Chicago .Mr. Parisons determined the latitude of tbe stations of observation. Duri11g tbe LouisvilleCbicago exchanges of longitude signals, the observers changed places to eliminate the effect of personal equation from the results for longitude, l\Ir. Parsons making the obse1Tation8 at Louisville and Mr. Terry those at Chicago. Further details are given under the heading just referred to. Stations occupied in continuation of the triangulation of the State of Wisconsin.-The report of Prof. J. E. Davies, Acting Assistant, in charge of geodetic operations in the State of Wisconsin, makes special mention of the progress of the triangulation in the vicinity of the boundary line between the States of "\<Visconsin and Illiuois, great interest being manifested in the true location of the parallel 420 30', which is prescribed by the con8titutM>n of the two States as the proper boundary between them. Especially is this interest shown in the city of Beloit, between stations "Clinton" and ''Newark" of the triangulation. What is called the State line passes through the heart of the business portion of the city, actually dividing the freight station of the Northwestern Rail way, so that a doorway is marked ""Wisconsi11" on one side and "Illinois" on tbe other. A dn·ision of this sort leads not unfrequently, of course, to complicated legal difficulties, especially in dealing with the criminal clas8el'l 7 and empliasizes tlie neces8ity of an accurate ~efiuitiou and marking of tlie boundary. As a prelimiuar;y step to the oc<·upation of stations" Newark" and'' Clinton,"tbeirdistancesfrom the acct·pted State line \\ere carefully measured with steel tape. Exteush·e cutting was found neces. sary to· clear the lines of sight from each station. While this was in progress, a reconnaissance was conducted by Professor Din·ies to determine the ft>asibility of exteuding the triangulation by determining the quadrilateral, Blue Mound, Wadham's Grom, Fayette, and W ashi11gton, ::\lid by the selection of a new station on the State line to the eastward of Olin ton. For the location of this poiut of the scheme, and that of other points here referred to, see Sketch No. 16.

Occupation of stations .for continuing to icestward the primary triangulation in Jllissouri and Kansas, near the thirty-·ninth parallel.-As stated in my last annual report, the party of .Assistant F. D. Granger was in the field at the end of Juue, 1883, engaged in the occupation of the primary station Normal, Johnson County, Missouri. The point oecupied, with the permission of the regents of the school was the top of the chimne_y of the State Normal School building, Warrensburg. Observations at "Normal" were finished July 2. Professor Osborne, to whose kindness and courtes_y the party was much indebted, has made request, for the use of the school, to be supplied with the geographical position of the statiou, its elerntion abo,·e the sea, and the distances and directions of all Rtations visible from it. This information, with ms apprO'rn,J, has been furnished to Professor Osborue. During the early part of the season, signals were erected at stations " Baker," ''Chapel Hill," Thornton, Hutton Mound, and Bowler, points of the scheme approved for the exten~ion of the work westward. (See Sketch No. 17.) The erection of so many signals was deemed advisable in order that the occupation of stations for the necessary angular measurements could be carried on uninterruptedly during the favorable season for ohserving, which in this section usually begins in June aud continues into November. Station "Caldwell," about sixteen miles S(IUtll of ·warrensburg, Johlll'IOl1 County, Mo .· was next occupied. Camp was pitched in an open field near the signal, and observations were begun July 11 and finished July 19. On the 24th of July, the party was transferred to station "Ilutton Motiud," ituout twelve miles southeast of Harrisonville, Cass Count~', :\fo. This station derives its present name from its owner, Mr. 11 utton, who Ii,·es half a mile to the westwar1l, but in the days of the earlier settlers was known as the "Big Mound," and was one of the landmarks wliiclt guided the emigrants on their journeys westward. It rises about one hundred feet aborn the general le,·el of the surrounding country, and although prominent because of its isolation, is less in elevation above the sea than any of the stations visible from it. At this station, the theodolite was mounted upon a tripod, eighteen feet auove the ground. Observations at "Hutton Mound" were finished by August 15, and the party was then transferred to Fulton, about two miles east of Harrisonville, where obsernitions were begun August 20. The tlieodolite at this station was elevated tweut_y-t.wo feet above the ground. Station "B<tker," near Kings,·ille, Jouuson County, was next occupied, work having beguu here September 11. Thi1:1 station is situated at the southern end of a chain of small hills, which begins nt:iar Knoxville and extends about fifteen miles in a northerlj· direction, Near tl1e northeastern limit of thei,,e hills, and near the village of Chapel Hill, Lafayette County, station Chapel Hill, the next in order of occupation, is situated. The observations at" Baker" having been finished September 28, "Chapel Hill" was occupied at the bl'ginni11g of October. The theodolite was mounted upon the tripod of the signal at an ele· vation alJove the ground of fifty-four feet, this elerntion being needed to clear two of the lines of sight over the tops of trees. ·work at this station hadng been finished, the i,;easou clo1wd with the occupation of" Thoruton," a point 'Situated alJout three and a half miles uorth ward of Pleasant Hill, Cass County, where obsen-atiolls were made between October 23 and November 2. Mr. Granger commends the efficient services of Messrs. J. E. McGrath aud A. P. Barnard, ·who served as Aids in the party. Mr. MeGrath made most of the obserrntious of double zenith distances, and assisted in the me:umrement of horizontal directions. Mr. Barnard recorded the observations, and aided in the office-work.

OcC'Upation of stations in Nmw,da, and reconnaissance in Utah for the extension eastwa,rd of the primary triangulation near the tltirty·nintlt parallel.-At the beginning of the ;ftscal year, the party of Assistant William Eimbeck was engaged in a reconnaissance of the table mountains east of the Sevier Riwr in Utah, known as the ·wasatch Plateau, with a view of developing the extension of the primary triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel from the line "Nebo-Beaver" eastward across the high plateaus of Central Utah. It was necessary to carry out this reconnaissance before occupying further stations of the great hexagon, because preliminary examinations of the high plateau country in question the year before had shown that a quadrilateral with open diagonals was not only wholly impracticable, but that the very locality, the king summits of the Wasatch Plateau, where the central station of a polygonal figure had of necessity to be established, was shut off from view at Bea\'er station by the interposition of Belknap, a nearer and higher peak of the Tushar Mountains. The closer examinations at the 'Vasatch Plateau, and subsequent ones from several of the principal summits of the Tushar Mountains showed that the change in the location of the station "Beaver," as referred to in my last annual report, was unavoidable, and that there existed no other choice than to locate it upon Belknap. For even Delano, the king peak of the group, which, on account of its location would h~ve yielded the most favorable figure, proved unavailing on account of intercepting " tables" upon the line to Wasatch. The preliminary reconnaissance from Mount Nebo during the previous year, together with the thorough and exhaustive examinations this ye.ar in the Wasatch Plateau and Tushar Mountains, snfficetl to determine upon the quadrilateral figure Nebo, Patmos Head, Mount Ellen, and Mount Belknap, as shown in progress sketch No. 18. This is, indeed, the only adequate figure obtainable by which the main chain of triangulation may be carried eastward from the long line "NeboBelknap." The development of a single definite figure, as above described, was all that was contemplated in carrying on the reconnaissance. Hence, on completing the examinations at the Tusbar Mountains, further reconnaissance work was suspended, and the party was transferred to Jeff. Davis Peak, the re-occupation of which was rendered necessary by the abandonment of "Beaver" station and the substitution for it of" Belknap." After a tedious and toilsome journey through two hundred miles of a desolate country, the party arrived at Lehman's Ranch, near the eastern base of Jeff. Davis Peak on the 19th of July, and at once began preparations for the ascent of the peak, which rises to a height of thirteen thousand one hundred feet. By the 26th of July camp was established at the summit. Three days' observations would have sufficed to determine the difference in directions of the heliotropes at Beaver and Belknap, but owing to thunder-s'torms, which hung almo11t constantly over the peak, and the distant mountains as well, it was the 6th of August before all of the observations needed could be obtained. Mr. Eimbeck remarks that the trials of the ten days' life of the party among the clouds were more severe and dangerous than bad been experienced for several years. The violence of the electric discharges, the thunder-claps, and the energy of the piping sound of the escaping electricity was not unfrequently so alarming that the party had to seek ' safety behind and under ledges of rock some distance below the summit of the peak, which was often struck by lightning. The tent occupied by the men was also struck, but fortunately at a time when no one was in it. Pioche station, in Lincoln County, Nev., a mountain of 8,800 feet in height, was next occupied. This is the last station of the work within the borders of Nevada. Owing to delay in getting means of transportation from Lehman's Ranch, arising from the difficnlty of hiring hands dnring the season of harvest, most of the month of August was ~upied in the transfer of the party and

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

camp outfit to the summit of Pioche. The observations at Pioche were completed by the 1st of October, after which the party was disbanded, the instruments and camp outfit being transferred to Nephi, Utah, where they were stored for the winter. The work of the season to the dat~ just named includes, besides the usual observations of horizontal directions and vertical angles, togethe.r with the necessary meteorological observations, determinations of time, latitude, and azimuth, and a complete set of observations for magnetic declination, dip, and intensity. Occasion was taken also, especially when at Lehman's Ranch, to carryout local triangulations, connecting the State boundary between _Nevada and Utah, and thereby the land surveys of those two States with the geodetic work. The station near Lehman's Ranch at which the Transit of Venus of 1882 was obsen'ed by l\fr. Eimbeck was connected with the main . triangulation at Jeff. Dav\s Peak and at Pioche. Special report will be made upon the results of the reduction of these local triangulations. From Jeff. Davis Pea,k a new determination was made of the azimuths of the reference marks of Tres-Pinos and Snake Valley magnetic stations, as occupied during the previous season. Having completed the arrangements at Nephi for storage, Mr. Eimbeck took up the reconnaissance for the location and connection of the proposed bn.se line in the vicinity of Salt Lake City and Mount Nebo, as authorized by instructions issued in October, 1883. The month of November was chiefly occupied with examinations of the country in the vicinity of Nephi and Juab, in Salt Lake Valley, as well as along the line of the Denver and Rio Grande Railway, near the cities of Kaysville and Ogden. Owing to the lateness of the season, the snow being deep on the mountains and in the valleys, it was impracticable to make these examinations as exhaustive as was desirable, yet as far as made they were enough t-0 show that suitable sites for base-lines, connecting adequately with the main chain of the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation could be located of a sufficient length, both in Juab Valley, near Mount Nebo, and in the vicinity of Salt Lake City. The reconnoitering work thus done included the provisioual examination of four distinct sites for base-lines, 1ogether with such connecting schemes as the hurried survey of the surrounding country had shown to be possible, if not feasible. Early in the summer of 1884 the reconnaissance was resumed, the examinations extending principally over the high mountains near Ogden, Salt Lake City, and Alta, the vallt'y south and west of Salt Lake City, the Juab Valley, and the mountains 1;outh of Nebo and the town of Levan. As the result of these examinations a special report was submitted referring to two sites and their connecting schemes-the Juab and Salt Lake bases.· l\fr. George F. Bird served acceptably as Aid in the party from the 22<1 of August till the 17tb of November, when he was detached for other dnt.y. Under Mr. Eimbeck's direction he assisted in the time and latitude obiIBrvations, and occupied the st<ttions at Nephi, Provo, and Salt Lake City for the determination of the magnetic elements. With regard to the experiments instituted by Mr. Eimheck for ascertaining the practicability of using the light of the moon for night-signaling in geodetic operations, he remarks that the results were so promising as to warrant the resumption of the experiments during the present sea.son, when there will be opportunities of testing the efl'ect of the light on much longer lines than was practicable last year.

SPECIAL OPERATIONS.
Okarge of the oonstirtwtitm of the Coast and Geodetic steamer Carlile P. Patterson.-Iu pursuance of the action of Congrnss authonizing the constmctiou of a steamship for the 8LlrVeJ of the Pacific coast and sounds, and making appropriation therefor in the stmdry civil expenses act approved March 3, 1883, plans and specifieations were prepared nuder the direction of Commander C.

D. Leary, of Brooklyn, N. Y. The contract was signed July 1, aTHl Commander ChesLer was appointed inspector on the part of the Go>ernment, Lieut. Richardson Olo,·er, U. S. N., and Passed Assistant Engineer, H. N. Sternnson, U. S. N., being assigned as his assistants. Lieutenant Clover, who had been associated with Commander Chester iu the preparation of the data, from the inception by the late Superintendent of the pr~ject of building a vessel especially adapte(l to the survey of Ala8kan waters, was stationed at New York, taking the immediate charge of the work, and under his constant watchfulness nearly ever timber aml bolt that went into the construction of the steamer received careful inspection. It i8 beJie,·ed that the plan of having the officer upon whom was to rest the respon8ibility of commanding the vessel in her voyage to the Pacific appointed as the immediate l'lupervisor of her construction, was fraught with good results to the Government, aml that he acquitted himself with cre~lit is well known. l\Ir. Steveusou was located at Philadelphia, where the steamer'8 machiuery was being made by Messrs. Neafie & Levy. Thioi officer had also been associated with Commauder Chester in planning the rnachincr.v, and, as her future engineer officer, was deeply interested in the careful construction of the motive power of the vessel. This arrangement of duties left Commander Chester free to proceed from point to point where he was nee<lecl to decide questions of construction, and to see that all workmanship and material were of the best quality :md satisfactory to the inspector. The 8team~r, named the Carlile P. Patterson, after the late Superintendent, was launched Jan nary 15, 1884, and at the date at which this report closes had made two satisfactor.Y trial trips, and was uearly fitted for her voyage to the Pacific coast. Charge of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Exhibit at the Southern E.Iposition, Loui1:1ville, Ky.-The Southern Exposition, held at Louisville, Ky., in the summer and autumn of 1883, was, as a whole, prindpally illustrative of the manufacturing and agricultural interests of the country; but there were many fine commercial exhibits, and the displa.y was national in itt:1 character, exhibits being cent.red there from all parts of the United States, and the following departments or bureaus of the GO\·ernment. hPi11g repreiwnted in addition to tile Coast and Geodetic Snr\'ey, viz: The Geological Survey, the Signal Service, the National Musemn, the Bureaus of Bducation and of Engraving and Printing, the Life-Sa Ying Service, the Fish Commission, and the United States Mint at Philadelphia. Assistant II. W. Blair, having been assigned to the charge of the exhibit made by this Survey left Washington for Loui:n-ille in the latter part of July. In the arrangements for placing the instruments, charts, and other articles illustrating the methods and apptiances of the Coast and Geodetic Sun-ey, Mr. Blair expresses his great indebtedness for kindness shown and assistance rendered by Maj. J. M. Wright, the manager of the expo. sitiou, and by Prof. J. U,. Procter, State geologist, who had general charge of the placing of the Government exhiuits. Mr. Blair rema1·ks that to the general visitor the display made by the Government seemed to be one of the most attractive ones. That of the Coast and Ueodetic Survey showed the principal inRtruments used in its geodetic, astronomical, topographic, hydrographic, and magnetic work, with illustrations of the results of the work by selections from the published charts, collections of the Annual Reports, Coast Pilots, and Tide Tables, and by a model of the basin of the Gulf of l\lexico constructed in the office from the results of soundings made between 1876 and 1878. This model attracted special attention ; :tpplications for copies of it were ma.de, and it bad many visitors from schools and classes of atlvanced studPnts. For the exposition management Mr. Blair prepared a concise description of the articles forming the Coast an1l Geod~tic Survey Exhibit, together with a. short account of their use. This paper appears as Appendix No. 18. At the close of the exposition two awards were made to the Survey ; one a medal for the exhibit a8 a whole, and the other a diploma for the line-and.end comparator. Comparisons of .~tandards of weight and measure, and inoestigations relati1'fl to determinations of gravity.-Tbe s1wcial investigations relating to determinations oi gravity and to comparisons of standards, carried on in Great Britain and on the "'ontinent during the summer of 1883 by Assistant C. S. Peirce have been already referred to in Parts I and II of this report; in the former under the heading "Special Scientific Work," and in the latter under the heading of Section UL

With reference to the ratio of the meter to the yard, to obtain an exact value of which has been one of the objects kept in dew during the course of his investigations, Mr. Peirce makes the following statement: "The ratio of the meter to the yard is still a matter of considerable uncertainty. Rater's value of the meter, 39.3707 inches is universally regarded as too long. Clarke's, 39.3704 inches, though undoubtedly more nearly correct, is not founded upon an examination of sufficiently good meters. The value given by Prof. W. A. Rogers, 39.37027 inches, is probably the most correct, but may be in error by one or two ten thousands of an inch. The main difficulties of the determination are four: " '1. To obtain a length known to be equal to a meter. " '2. To compare quantities practically incommensurable. "' 3. To compare two bars, one of which is standard at the freezing point while the other is standard at 62° F. "' 4. To compare a line-measure with an end-measure.' "As the amount in doubt is large as compared with the best measures of the length of the second's pendulum, we may obtain a value of the meter not unworthy of consideration by comparing the value of the seconds' pendulum at Kew as determined by Captain Heavyside in inches with tbe same value as determined in terms of the meter by myself. This gives for the meter 39.3700 inches. In order to obtain a better comparison, two re\'~rsible pendulums, made on the sa.me pattern, one measuriug a yard and the other a meter between the knife-edges, were swung simulta· neously, each near its standard temperature at the Coast Survey Office. The pendulums were also interchanged so as to determine at the same time their coefficients of expansion. Assmmng that by this method a meter and a yard bar can be made which shall bear to each other a relation capable of the most accurate determination, it will still be important to devise a method by which a check can be kept upon the chauges in length to which all bars are liable by molecular action. Mr. Peirce has accordingly devoted much attention to the spectrum meter-a meter constmcted so as to be readily compared with the length of a wave of light. Attendance of a delegate on the part of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at the International Geodetic Conference at Rome.-Shortly before the time fixed for the seventh annual conference of the International Geodesic Association at Rome, I received from General Ibanez, of Spain, the president of the conference, a letter expressing his urgent hope that American science would be represented at Rome by a delegate from the United Stares. In view of the international importanoe of fixing upon a meridian which should be employed as a common zero of longitude and standard of timereckoning, and of the great desirability of having the opinions of men of science in the United States brought before the conference during its discussions of these subjects, I took the earliest opportunity to obtain from the Department its sanction to the appointment of Mr. R. D. Cutts, Assistant in charge of the office, as a delegate to the conference. But short notice having been given, Mr. Cutts was able to reach Rome only on the morning of October 15, the first day of the session. Reference has been made in a preceding pad of this report to the part taken by him in its deliberations, and to the resolutions which were finally adopted as embollying the conclusions of the conference. The subsequent action of this Government upon the final resolution recommending an International Convention to be held at Washington, as proposed -by the United States and advocated by its delegate, is well known. T1·ansportation of valuable standards of iveight and measure from England to Franee.-Occasiou having arisen for the transportation under responsible personal supervision of two important standards of weight and measure from the British Standards Office in London to the International. Bureau of Weights and Measures at Breteuil, near Paris, advantage was taken of a contemplated visit to Europe of Dr. Thomas Craig, of the Johns Hopkins University, who had kindly offered to be of service to the Survey. Dr. Craig's former.connection with the work has sufficed to keep up his strong interest in it. Upon bis arrival in London, early in Jame, he went to the Standards Office and there received the sta.ndard yard (Low-moor iron No. 57), and standard Arago platinum kilogram and transported H.E:x:.43-11

them to Paris, depositing tbe.m on the 9th of June at Sevres with the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. The yard wa.s simply deposited for safe keeping during the summer, and the kilogram for comparison. On lea\·ing Paris, Dr. Craig stopped at Sevres and received the standards again, took them to Washington, and delivered them to the Bureau of Weights and Measures on September 3, 1884. Under his care every precaution was taken to protect the standards from concussion or injury from any cause whatever. Tidal obseruations at Honolulu, Sand1rich Island.8.-The superintendent of the survey of the Sandwich Islands, W. D. Alexander, esq., bas continued to transmit to this office the records from the s1llf-regil:itering tide-gauge loaned to him by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in June, 1877. Blank forms of reduction, and tidal rolls are also supplied to him. The series will have @pecial value in the discussion of the tides of the Pacific, and their comparison with those recorded on the coasts of Mexico, California, Oregon, and Alaska.
COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE.

From the heginning of the fiscal year until early in October, 1883, the charge of the office was continued with Assistant Richard D. Cutts. Upon his departnre for Europe to attend the conference of the lntNnational Geodetic Association at Rome, as a delegate on the part of the United State.s (reference to which has been made ou pages 4-, 6, 17, and 81 of this report.), Assistant Cutts was relim·ed by Assistant Charles A. Schott, who was assigned to act for him during- his absence. \V he11 Mr. Cutts returned, towards the close of :November, he resumefl charge of the office, hut, his health rapidl,v failed and on the 13th of December, after an illness of about a week, he died. 'rhe suddenness of this m·ent,, aml the great loRs to the work involved in it, as "'ell as its severance of strong personal friendships, occasioned deep and wide-spread regret. His aRsociates 011 the Sun·e;r expressed their sense of his loss by resolutions and addresses at a meeting called for the purpose December 15. The proceedings of this meeting have been placed on record on pages 14 and l.'i of this report. Until a permanent assignment could be made, A ssiRtant Schott was designat~d to take charge of the office. In .Tan nary, 18M, Assistant Charles 0. Boutlle was pla-0ed in charge, and entered upon !tis duties ,January 7. In his report of the office operations during the fiscal year, which appears as A1;pendix No. 4, :Mr. Boutelle, who had served nearly forty years in field duty, ackowledges bis indebtedness to the method, system, and order introduced by his predecessors in lightening his labori,i, and also the kindly aid afforded by those of long experience in offioo details. Assistant Andrew Braid was on duty as executive officer in the office of the Assistant in charge until January, 1884, when he was transferred to the office of the Superintendent, and Assistant H. W. Blair, who had been on duty under the immediate direction of the Superintendent, was assigned in Mr. Braid's place. The report of the Assistant in charge is accompanied by the reports of the chiefs of the several office divisions. It is worthy of note that although the demands for information from the records and results of the Survey, and requests for its publications have increased largely during the year, while no increase of force has been practicable in the office, nevertheless the extra labor required to comply with these demands promptly has been cheerfully given. The distribution of the charts bas increased sixteen per cent. during the year, and in the electrotyping department, under the direction of Assistant Ogden, a larger amount of work has been done than in any previous year. This has been the case also in the engraving division, which, as well as the electrotyping and printing divisions, has remained under Mr. Ogden's direction. Full reference is made in the report to improvements in methods and processes tending towards greater efficiency and economy in the field and office operations. A new set of projection tables based upon the Clarke spheroid and exteqding from the equat.or t.o the poJe has been computed, and appears in Appendix No. 6. At the request of the Commissioner of Agriculture a measurement has been undertaken, and partly completed, of the areas of salt and fresh marsh upon the Atlantic coast. The interest aroused by the model of the basin of the Gulf of Menco, which was exhibited

by Mr. Hilgard at the November meeting of the National Academy of Sciences, 1880, led the Superintendent to direct the construction of another one on the same scale, which includes in its limits not only the depths of the sea in the Gulf of Mexioo and the Bay of North America,· but also a representation in relief of the islands in the approaches to the Gulf, the Bermuda group, and parts of the continent. On the north this model reaches to the Great Lakes, on the south to Ouba, and in an east and west direction from Halifax and St. Thomas to the Llanos Estacados at the base of the Rocky Mountains and the city of Mexico. Its construction was intrusted to Messrs. A. and H. Lindenkohl, the former the chief draughtsman in the office. They had been associated in the construction of the model of the Gulf, and were familiar with the data needed for the larger work. The submarine part of this model is ba8ed almost entirely upon the recent soundings by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, though the Challenger soundings and those of the· Fish Commission have also been taken as authority when needed. The construction of the orographic part was greatly facilitated by access to the manuscript of the Dictionary of Altitudes (since published), kindly accorded by l\lr. Henry Gaunett, of the Geological Survey. The model was exhibited at the Internatioual Fisheries Exhibition in Loudon; at tlw meetiug in Washingtou of the National Academy of Sciences iu April, 1884, and at. the meeting in Philadelphia in September, 1884, of the American Association for the Advancement of Scieuce. Upou each of these occasions it attracted great attention and received higl1 commendatiou. lJ pou the two occasions last mentfoned the Supe1'intendent read a paper upon the strnctural features of the two great basim; which are revealell by the model iu so striking a manner. A description of it appear8 in Appendix No. 17. It is proposed to exhibit it at the approaching Worltl's Exposition at New Orleans. Iu the progres8 of the Sur,'ey, some important questions have arisen iu regard to the proper designation and orthography of geogravhical name~;. ln many localities ditforent names h:we been found in use for the same characteristic foatures; local authorities difler irreconcilably, and the origin of their ditterences is often obscure. Hence the need was long felt of au authoritath·~1 historical account of the progress of discovery and exploration on the co~i.sts of the U11ited Statel-1 1 by the aid of which aboriginal names might be traced to their source, true orthographies established, corruptions pointed out, and the names given by early discoverer:s referred to the ht1st authorities. . Iu the Ueports for 1855 a.nd 1856, Professor A. D. Bache, then Superintendent, alluded at, some length to this subject, aud stated that he had availed himself of the visit to Utis country of a distinguished ethnographer, Dr. J. U. Kohl, t,o reque8t him to prepare a complete historical statement of the discoveries and explorations on the Atlantic, Unlf, and Pacific coasts of the United State8. Dr. Kohl had previously wade au ex.tensive collection of maps of discovery on this continent, and was peculiarly qualified by his studies and researches for the important work committed to his charge. Abstracts of the papers of Dr. Kohl were published in the Coast Survey Reports for 1855 aud 1856; his manuscripts and maps have been preserved for reference in the Archives. It is believed that the occasion has now arrived for the publication of these valuable historical memoirs. They appear in Appendix. No. 19. Reference was made in my last annual report to the work of Assistant W. H. Dall in the preparation for publication of a new edition of the Coast Pilot of Alaska. The first volume has now been published under the title "P~cific Coast Pilot, Alaska, Part I, Dixon Entrance to Yakutat Bay with the Inland Passage." The man.uscript of a new and enlarged edition of the Catalogue of Charts was prepared during the summer ot' 1884 by Assistant Blair, and revised for early publication. Mr. W. B. Morgan has served with acceptance as Disbursing Agent of the Survey.· He has had the aid of Mr. John W. Parsons as accountant and of Mr. V. J. Fagin as examiner.
·This appellation was auggeated by the Superintendent at the April meeting of the National Academy of Sciences,

1884, to deeignate that great embayment of the North Atlantic which lies west of a line drawn from Newfoundland through the Bel'llludu to Saint Thomae in the We&t Indies.

REPORI' OF THE ASSIST.ANT DY CHARGE OF OFFICE AXD TOPOGRAPHr FOR THE YEAR ENDING

ao,

U. t:;.

COAS'l' AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, June 30, 1884. SIR: I respectfully submit herewith my annual report from the office, with those from each division, showing the character and quantity of the work accomplished dnring the last fiscal year. The very large amount of work pl\l'formed in the Computing Di\·isiou, as reported bs ARsistant C. A. Schott, in charge of it, attests the ability and industry of himself au<l all the perRons employed under liis direction. The incesio;ant calls made upon AR:sistant Schott to enable me to answer the almost daily requests from all parts of the conn try for information only obtainable from our records and computatiomi liaxe been invariably, promptly, and fully met. I specially ask yonr attention to tlw large increase in calls for the isogonic charts of magnetic variation in the United St<ttes, published in your report of 1882, and the tables accompanying them. The Engraving, Electrotyping, and Printing have continued in charge of Assistant H. G-. Ogden. He reports that in addition to the regular work of the di\·ision there· has been an unusual amount of ad1litional labor in corrections to engra,·e(l plates collRequent upon new suHeys. About four hundred plates have required greater or less correction. Mr. Ogden refers to the death of Mr. A. Sengteller, who had been emplo~·ed since 1856 and was one of our best engravers. Mr. F. W. Benner also clied in October last. Increased efficiency bas been obtained in the electrotype department, where a larger amount of work bas been done by Dr. A. Zumbrock, under Mr. Ogden's direction, than in any previous year. In the printing department a new press has been added. The demand for and cowseqnent printing of charts has i,ucreased 16 per cent. during the year, while t,herc has been so far no increase of force. Mr. Ogden awards great credit to Mr. Moore, foreman, and the other pri11ter11 for their zealous and effective work. He also calls attention t-0 the efficient services of Mr. J. H. Smoot, clerk of the division. The report of ·the Tidal Division shows the usual amount of labor, under direction of Mr. R. S. Avery. The new tide-predicting ma.chine bas betm used with advantage and effect. In the Drawing Division seventy special drawings and tracings ba,re been furnished in answer to calls for information. This has been in addition to the usual regular duties of the diviRion, which has fully kept up with the fteld-work of the season. I desire to notice specially the assistance I have received from Mr. W. T. Bright, clerk of the division, to whose labor and supervision much of tbe efficiency of the division is due. · The custody of the Archives has been in the bands of Mr. R. M. Har,·ey, who reports that the tota.hnumber of records of every kind registered during the year has been two thousand and thirtyftve, or one hundred and ninety-nine in excess of the previous year.

Mr. Saegmuller, Chief Mechaqician, reports increased precision and efficiency in the dividing engine. A. great improvement tending to increased precision in obscr\·ation has heen effected by suppl_ying theodolites for the highn order1:< of triangulation, with telescopes of increased power. In all matters i11 his department I h:we been imlehtell to him for zealous co-operation in keeping our field parties well and snffieientl,\· supvlierl with every means needed for f'ffective work. The report of M:r. l\L \V. \Vines, chief of the l\Iiscellaneous Division, gh·es a full account of the distrilmtiou and sale of the puLli<'ations of the Survey. In addition to this duty, :Mr. \Yin<'S has bad general charge of the office buildings, of the Car· penter Shop, and thn l\!ap-mounting and Chart rooms. Not, only in these 1ln1ies, hut in otlter special and oiornetimes difficult duties, he has rendered zefllous and etiicient senice, 1le111andmg special acknowledgnwnt at my bands.

Wa8liington, .htne 30, 1884. Srn: In conformit.Y with regulations, I herewith reHpectfnlly submit the usual annual report. of work do11e by the several computm·s during the fit.;cal year en11ing June 30, 1884. 'l'he charge of the Computing Dh·i~iou has lwen continuetl with the und(·rsigned, aud no chauge took plaet~ in its iwrso111wl, tlwngh it required all the experience and euergy of its members to kP1.·p up with the cmn·11t 1rnrk aml to put the result::; of the older triangulations on the modern data demanded awl adopted in Pehruary, 1880. No extra help was afforded this di>ision during the year. Dnring the temporary absence of the As"'istant in charge of' the office and topography, I was called upon todi,,.~harge thost· duties during October and Xovember, aud again between Dt·cember 12, 1883, and .Jamiary 7, 18M, on whieh last date I was relieved by Assistant C. 0. Boutelle. By direction of the Snperiutendent I took charge of the magnetic obserYations made at the inter· national polar station, Ooglaamie, Ala.ska, occupied during 1881, 1882, and 1883, directing the computations and reporting the results of the absolute and differential observations.

For this work special clerical aid was provided by the Chief Signal Officer. On December 19, 1883, Sergeant ,J, K '.\Iaxfield a11d on January !;ll, 1884, Prh'ate G. W. Kuopf reporte1l for duty. The former continued with this dh·ision to the clrn;e of the year; the latter wa8 relieved from this special dnt.v i\Iay 11, 1884. On May 10, I submitted in duplicate a foil report of the results obtained. After this I was e.nga~ed in completing a discussion of the hypsometric measures undertaken in 1880 by Assi8tant George Davidson in connection with the stud.) of atmospheric refraction at :Mount Diablo and i\1artiuez East, <Jal. l\Iy report on tllese results is dated June 5, 1884. Theise two r<:>portis are pnhlished as appendices to the Snperintemleut's auuual report for 1883. The usual annual magnetic obsen-ations were made by me at the mag·nctic observatory iu this city. The charge of the duplicate records of the astronomical, geodetic, a11d magnetic observations was continued with this di,-ision. The calls on this branch of the oflice for certain scit~ntific information required by office and field varties, in reply to official corrPspornleuee, when refrrred to this divh1ion, were promptly <ttternfod to. The registers of geographical positious iu the Uompnting and Drawing DiYisions were kept np to date, a111l 11eedful information, geodetic arnl magnetic, for the charts issued by the Surwy, was su11plied. 'l'his di,·isiou also atteudPd to the annual statistics, astronomical, geodetic, aud mag·netic, a1Hl to proofreading of its scientific papers appearing in the annual report; examined for completeuess of statement all a~tronomical, geodetic, and magnetic records, and reported tile results reached by the several computers. The work performed b,y each computer tluri11g the fiscal year is herewith given in detail. Mr. Edwartl II.

DEAR Sm: I rm;pectfully Ruhmit this report on the work of the Tidal Division, of which I have been in charge during the ;year.
OBSERVATIONS.

Self-registeriug tide-gauges haw been used at tlw followiug stations: Pulpit Harbor, North Haven, :\Ie.; Block Island, R I.; "Xew London, Conn.; S,u1<ly Hook, X. J.; Sancelito, Cal.; Saint Paul, Kadiak Island, Alal'ika; aiHl Honolulu, Sarnlwich IHlall<ls. lH 8cptemhcr. 1881, on requisition, the last supply of papN mHl bla11k forms wail 1w11t for 11s1· 011 the Helf-n·gisteri11g g-ange loa11ed to the city engineers at Pro\·ideuce, R 1., a11d thc,Y promised to sewl to tlti.-; office more of their observations soon, but 110 more h:we lweu receiw·cl yet. A self-registcri11g tidt·-g:rnge wa:s sent nearly a year ago for use in the J)p.Jaware l{iYer, lllelow Philadelphia, hy thP Cnik<l State8 engineers, in accordance with an arraHgement with them. The ohsen·ations are to ht' for tlJPir use and also for the u8e of the Coast aml Geo1letic Snrn;_v. I u Septcm bcr, 18:·n, 011 application from the officer in co111nm1Hl of tl1e artiller,Y Rclwol at Fort .'.\lonroe, a i>elf-n·;.;i:stcring tide-gauge was sent then', furnished with paper and blank forms for ahout a year, to be u8ell by the stnlle11ts, the ohser\'atio11s to he retume<l with tLe gauge. I make 110 rccomrul'll(latious for occupying new Rtations with Relf.n·giHtl>ring gauges at present, except hy hydrograpltic parties for facilitating and impro,·ing the hydrogTaphic work, arnwgemcnts for which an· in progn·ss; hut tht> reco111111e1Hlatinn8 made iu my last annual n~port are such as I would renew, if circum'stauces shonld at any time be <lccuw<l fayora ule.

The ohservations at Block Island were st.opped owing to the gange being broken hy a Yel'\sel running against the tide house. The observations at New Loudon were stopped ~1ft(~r ha dug heen continued a ;veaT. There arP two Relf regist.eriug tide-gauges in tlw oflice for which clocks are wanting. The tidal observations made by the hydrographic parties of tht> S1uT1',Y are i118pected as soon as received, and reduced in the Tidal Division. Notices.of them may he found in the 1-1tatements of work done in the different sections. They are generally made wil ha staff or a box gauge, usually during daylight only, and sometimes quite irregularly. It is rnr.v desirable that such observatious should be macfo more continuously, as there is liability to imperfect reduction of sound-· ings, especiall~· where there is only one tide in a day or large diurnal iut>q nality.
OFFICE':-WORK.

Most of the observers furnished with self-registering gauges have heen taught to tabulate the high and low waters and hourly ordinates from the curves before sending these to the office, and then send the tables and curves at different times, thus preventing losses by mail and other acci-

U~ITED

STA.TES COAST A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Tllis mo(le of working has been found to make the ohseners more skillful and can·ful, and reduce tlrn amount of otlice-work. The results of the obserYations n·ceh-ell from the self.n·gistering gauges aJl(l hydrographic parties are i1sed in prediction, chart rnakiug, arnl for otlwr purposes. The re<ludions and di:,;cnssious that ha\e been madl1 enable the <lidsion to fur11isl1 a large am01mt of information about tit.lPs to officers of tlw Snn·ey, ciYil and lTHited States engiueers, aIHl otlwrs, and the demand for it has bePn rapidly iucrf,asing.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVBY OFFICE,
Wa~hington,

June BO, 1884.

DEAR SIR: The synopsis here presented of the work done in the Drawing Didsiou under my supen·isiou during the fiscal year endiug Juue 30, 1884, will sene to show the character of the labor pl'rformed hy eaeh person conneeted with the dh-ision; and the summarized statement accompanying gh-rs in detail itb1'tracts of the ,Year's results. The charts that were completed or in progress, the plane-table sheets inked, and the miscellaneous drawings fi11isl1ed, together with the names of the draughtsmen wLo did the work, are giYen in the tabular statement appended. Year hj· ~-(·ar, a8 the area con·red by the survey increases, the calls on this di\'ision for special information, Ruch as tracings, compilations, nnfiuisbed proofs brought up by hand, transcripts of records, &c., have grown; but yet, notwithstanding Ute pressure of its regular work, the division has met all these demands with faithful promptness. How various a11d numerous have been the calls, may be seen by referring to Appendix No. 3, in which t.hose answered by the Drawing Division are iucluded. Forty maps and clrnrts, em bodying the several series of the catalogut>d pn blication clasi;;, have been in progress. Of this number eighteen were finished, twel\e of them by photolithograpby, the latter including three minute carefnlly-drawn maps, illustrating tlrn entire boundaries of all the cmstom districts of the United States, for the use of the Tre'.lsury Department. 'fbirty-four plane-table sheets were iuked in the best manner, preparatory to reproduction by photolithographic processes; projections were constructed upon fifteen copper plates for the use of the engravers;

numerous drawings of iustrumeuts of precisiou, notably the peu;pectiYe Yit>ws of tlie Ferrel tidepredicting machine, and diagrams illustrating profes8io11al pa peril, were made· for issue iu the annual report; tliirty-five projeetionR for topographic work aud forty-seYPJJ for lty<ll'og1.·apl1ic developments were constructed; progress was made upon the map of tht· l::uit1'<l Stat1·,.:, scalt~ JO mile8 to the inch, and au elaborate llHHlPI, in plaster, of tlit' Atlantic Ha;.:i11 aml Gulf of Mexico, was finished. 'l'he work, as rnmal, i11 this divisio11 has been of a diYersified awl diftienlt kilHl, and it affords me plt>asnre to testi(y to tlw faithful maimer with which the draughtsmen, oue and all, baye performed the duties allotted to them, all(l to the iligh order of skill displayed b,y thellJ in execution thereof. Tht· persomiel ha~ rernai11t·d u11cha11ged. N earl_y all dra wi11gs have beeu iuked with a view to rcpro<1udion,. iu order tliat any sudden cal! could be met at ouce. To make delay as LS}iort a LS po8siblt>, 1111·lirni11ar;y editions of man~ 1ww ehart.s are now drawu for, :rnd publiLShed b,y photolithograph;v, imm< diatel_y after the surH\\'S are completed. Thei;e r,;erTe until the fiual eugraYed charts an' i,.;sued, thus bri11giug the information th·',V <';mtaiu hefon·. tlie puhlie without loiss of time. Tlw draught~nll'IJ han· become b,\· experieIJce qnih· ex put in making photolitbogravliic drawings, which require practical i,;killed knowledge in their execution to produce good priuts. The names of the draughtsmen, together with an outliue of tl1e distributiou of \rnrk among them, are as follows: l\lr. A. Lindeukol1l lrns heeu occupied iu the construction of a minntP topograpl1ieal map of the United States, scale of 10 miles to the inch, but has fonml time to construct au accurate awl elaborate model of the depths of the sea in the Bay of North America and the Gulf of Mexico, aml to keep the progress sketches of the surHy :mpplied with the latest iuformatiou . .Mr. B. Lindenlwhl has prepared the following photolitltogn1phic drawings: Ilart aud City Islands; San Pedro Barbo!', Cal.; Destruction Island, \Y. T., and a new map of .Alaska Tenitory, and also numerous n·ductioHs for the annual report. Mr. C. Junk en has dt>voted his time principally to the rPduction of hydrography for eugraYiug. Mr. E. J. Sommer, who llad bet:u on leani of absence, returne<l t<· tue oflice and resumed his position in the division in November. His work has been the maki11g of projections on paper aud copper, and reductions of topography and hydrography. He reduced Coast Chart No. Hi'.!, Cape Canaveral to Indian River Inlet, and prepared the photolithograpltic drawi11g for the chart of Black Hock Harbor. l'rlr. T. J. O'Sullirnn reduced the topography for Coast Chart No. 176, Charlotte HarlJor to Tampa Bay, gnternl ktteriug; a1ul made the photolithographic <lrawings for charts of tht> iuside pa8sage of Indian Hin'r, and tor prngres8 of the tram;contiue11tal triaugulatiou from the Paci tic coast westward; also sketch ot" triaugulatiou in l\li;;souri and Jllinofa. Mr. P. Eriehseu, in addition to reducing the topography for Coast Clmrt No.141', Bop1e Iulet to New; Topsail Inlet., inked fiye plane-table sheets, verified engTaved charts, and made a i;el'ies of perspective drawings of the tide-predicting macl1i11e. Mr. L. Karcher has been employed chiefly in making the nurn(·rons projedions required hy field parties, preparing projects aud <liagrams for office use, tracing and miscellaneous work. Mr. Karcher was off duty }larch 29 to.July 1. Mr. .A. B. Graham, '"'hi le engaged al most exclusively in consfrnetin g hydrographic projections~ plotting geographical positions, and transferring shorr-line to pmjections mit<le by other draughts. men, bas inkt·d six topographical field sheets, and made traciugs arnl diagrams of 1lifiere11t kiud8. ~r. E. Il. Fowler has continued to ink plaue-tahle sheets, and during the ~·ear i11ked ele~Pll sheets complete Mr. Fowler also made the smooth drawiug for the photolitlrngraph of Delaware Break water. Mr. E. :Molkow iuke<l ten plane-table sheets, n)ade redudions, compiled statistics, aud prepared a fow diagrams. M.r. Barker has been employell in coloring buoys and light-houses and making additions aud

corrections upon the printed charts.

REI'OIIT OF THE EXGRJ.rJSG JJIVISIOS FOR THE YE.:lR ES/JING JUSE 30, 1884.

U. S.· Co A.ST

.A.ND GEODETlC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, ,June 30, 1884. Sm : I re;;;pectfully submit the following report of work executed in tbe Engraving Division during the fiscal ~'ear ending .June 30, 1884: In additwn to the regular eugradng we have bad an unu;;;ual amount of cleaning elf-'ctrotypes, erasurefi from altos: drawing and arrang"ing titles, general letteriug and notes, marking instruments, &c. 'l'he largt> amount of electrot~'piug done would naturally increase this class of work, but it bas lieeu still further angrnented during the past ;year by the corrections required i.1 bringiug up new printrng plates of many charts, the plates .of which had become mnch worn. The corrections to the plate:>, required before priuting··tor issue, ha\·e continued largely in exce:ss of former ~·can:i, and while we lmYe only hamlled four hundred plates in this class of work, it hi1s ueen most laborious, owing to the uum ber of corrections arising from new surveys. Th<:' fore<:' of engraver:,; ha;; been emplo_yed as follows: Mt·si-;rs. ,J. Enthoffer and H. F. Bartle on topography; Messrs. E. A. ~.faedel, A. Petersen, .J. G. Tlwmp;;;on, and F. Courtenay on lettering; Messrs. W. A.. Thompson and H. C. Evans on topograpl1y a11d xarnliug:; MessrR. E. H. Sipe, \V. II. Davis, and~'\... C. Ruebsam on letrnring and miscellaueons corrections; .Mei,;srs. H. M. Kuight au<l T. Wasserbacb on sanding and miscellaneous correction~.

The Snrn~y has lost the services of an expert engraver in the <leath of Mr. A. Sengteller, who dit'd A ngnst 11, 188:~. ~fr. St'ngtt'ller was engaged in raris in 1850, and immediately reported for duty in this otliee, where he remained continuously employed until his death, at the age of seventy. The mauy valuable cl~arts Jlnulixhed from the plate8 iutrusted to him bear ample testimony to his artistic :skill, full,Y smstaining the high recommendation girnn him when engaged for this special work on the surve~'· To within a few months of his death he was still faithful in bis labors, and even his latest work, with old age and bodily infirmities oppressing him, evinces that refinement of treatnwnt that hrought him reputation in youth. I have also to chronicle the death of Mr. F. W. Benner, on October 16, 1883. Mr. Benner had been emploJPd for many years on "job work" at his home, and though physically incapable of engra·ting a large amount, what he did was satisfactory, and his death has proved a measurable loss in that class of work to which be confined himself. The electrotyping of the copper plates bas continued under my direction, with the immediate

supervision of Dr. A. Zumbrock, assisted by Frank Over. Some of the improvements referred to in my last annual re,port have been completed. Two cells and oue vat have been added to the second battery, making it of equal capacity with the first. New rod8 for suspending the poles in the cells have been substituted since the close of the fiscal year, but sufficient observations have not yet been made to determine if they afford any particular advantage beyond that derived from rendering the batteries more easily taken care of. The addition of two cells and the vat to one battery has necessarily increased the results of the year's work, but a larger increase has been obtainell frnm a closer study and a more perfect knowledge of the req·1ire111ents of the work as it is now carried 011 under my llirection. This is seen at once in the quantity of copper deposited in comparison with that of previous years. During October, November, and December, 188.3, experiments were made by Mr. \Verner Suess, under the direction of Assistant Schott, with a view of improving the galrnnometer, but many trials demonstrated the system that had been in use to be the most reliable. A new instrument of more perfect workmanship, however, was made and set in place. The printing for the chart room has increased 16 per cent. during the year. In the summer months the requisitions are greater than the capacit.y of our presses. This necessarily creates some delay in the delivery of charts, but it is not believed the delays are yet so great as to demand an increase of the force. The capacity of the printing establishment is the same as the preceding year, and much credit is due the foreman, Mr. F. Moore, and the other print-ers, for their endeavors to keep up the supply of charts during the busy season. Mr. John H. Smoot has continued as clerk of the divisitm. It gi,·es me pleasure to commend him for the precision with which he keeps such a multiplicity of records, of late years largely augmented by the work of the printing and electrotyping.

REPORT OF THE MISCELLAXEOUS DIVISI8N FOR THE YEAR ENDIXfl. JUNE 30, 1884.

U. S. OFFICE CoAS'l' .A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY, Waaltingto'n, June 30, 188!.

SIR: I have the honor to submit herewith the annual report of this division for the year ending June 30, 1884. The general work of the division was the same as in former years. The' Annual Reports for the years 1881 and 1882 were printed during the year, thus bringing the series much nearer to current date than for many years previous. The Annual l~port for 1883 was also sent to press, aud considerable progress made towards its publication. This volume will be ready for distribn· tion before the Report for 1884 is submitted to Congress, when the whole series of annual reports will be up to date. For this much-desired result the office is largely ind6bted to the cordial co.operation of the Government Printing Office officials. The first ~dition of Sqbdivision 15 of the Atlantic Coast Pilot (Delaware Bay and River) was published, and the Pacific Coast Pilot, Alaska, Part 1 (Dixon Entrance to Yakutat Bay, with the Inland Passages) was sent to press.

A detailed statement conceruiug the above-mentioned publications is.appended hereto. Dh1tribution of the \Tarious pulllications of the Survey to the Departments of Gornrn ment, institutions, and indiYiduals was made as usual, and the Notices to Mariners and Appendices to the Annual Reports, published in pamphlet form, were distributed gratuitously in the customary rnanuer. Three thousand three hundred and twenty-two copies of the Annual Reports were distributed during the year; also 856 copies of the At.lantic Coast Pilot, including subdivisions. There were received in the cha,rt-room during the year 33, 743 sheets of charts, of which 28,19,'\ were copper-plate impressions, and 5,54.5 were printed from stone. Thirteen thousand three hundred and forty-seven copies were furnished to the several Executive Departments and to Senators and Representatives, and 17,418 sheets were supplied to sale agents. The total issue of charts during the year was 33,63~ copies, being an increase of 1,626 copies over the l'receding year. (See statement appended hereto.) The receipts from sales of publications amounted to $3,966.44, which sum was duly deposited iu the Treasury. The issue of charts was made under the immediate supervision of Mr. Hugo G. Eichholtz, who has continued in charge of the chart-room. The carpenter work of the office, inclu1ling the wood work of instruments and packing them for transportation, the construction of vats, frames, &c., for the laboratory, repairs of furniture, and repairs to the office building, &c., was under charge of Mr. A.. Yeatman up t-0 the time of his death, on the 2d of December, 1883. Mr. H. 0. French was appointed by the Superintendent to succeed Mr. Yeatman, and reported for dut.v on the 1st of January, 1884, since which date he has been in immediate charge of the carpenter shop. Messrs. G. F. Cox and G. W. Clarvoe were employed, as heretofore during the whole year, and reIHlered faithful and efficient ser\'ice to tlie chief carpenter. The map-mounting room bas been in charge of Mr. R. T. Bassett, as heretofore, and Mr. N. Y. Cavitt bas continued to discharge the duties of janitor. The messengers and laborers employed in the office have discharged their duties with a degree of fidelity and zeal that entitles them to commendation. Yours, respectfully, M. W. WINES, Ohief of Miscellaneous Division. C. 0. BOUTELLE, Esq., .Assistant, in charge of Office and Topography.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 0FFIOE,

Waskington, June 30, 1884. Sm: I have the honor to submit herewith the annual report of this division for the year

ending June 30, 1884. The work of this division includes the keeping of the records and the correspondence relating to the receiving and forwarding of instrnment8, their safe-keeping, and their repairs aud adjustment. Examination is made as soon as possible of all instruments returned by fteld parties. 'fbose

found to be in good order are sent to the fire-proof building; those needing repairs are put in hand in the instrument shop. As heretofore, a great part of my time was occupied with the perfecting of the divkling engine, and in graduating a number of instruments. The diviHious on a great nnmber of onr older theodolites and sextants have by long usage become so injured and indistinct that to make them useful they had to he re.graduated. In a majority of cases this involved also the insertion of new sil\'er hands, the old ones being too thin to admit of their being turned oft' true, and this bad to be doue especially with circles that had suffered a fall. A great number of instruments were also supplied with new and more powerful telescopes, the increased accuracy of the graduation making an increase iu the telescopic power desirable. Our old sextants not being originally supplied with the low-power telPscopes, which the new ones possess, it was deemed advisable to supply these telescopes, as far as practicable, to all of the sextants; this 11as been dque, and the greater part of our sextants are uow thus proYided. In order to be able to furnish, without delay, new mirrors to replace injured ones, it was found to be a great convenience to have a uniform standard size of mirror for all.sextants. vVe have therefore changed a number of our older mirror mountings to conform to those on the ne\\" ones, and new mirrors can now be sent out without ha\·ing to grind them to au odd i,;ize. l\'lr. ,John Clarke was on duty with the Coast Survey exhibit at the Louis\'ille ·Exposition, and was awar from the office for nearly four months. As heretofore, Mr. Clarke had the repairing of the magnetic instruments, levels of precision, longitude instruments, aud the ruling of glass diaphragms. In addition he reconstructed the old 18 inch theodolite No. 4 (Troughton & Simms), which also recefred a uew graduation. He also made from my design a double-image micrometer, which is m~ed as a dynameter to measure the magnifying power of telescopes. Mr. E. Eshleman assisted me in getting instruments ready for the field; be al8o kept recor1l of boxes received and delivered. He has bad charge of the theodolites, plane tables, and sextants, and prepared the greater number of the circles for regraduation. Mr. P. Vierbuchen has overhauled the base bars, and asssisted in their comparison; he also repaired the protractors and made 24 new night signal-lamps. In connection with Louis Fischer he made the new 100-foot comparator, by means of which we can now compare our meter chains, and tape lines. Mr. Louis Fischer assisted me very ably while working on the dividing engine in taking micrometer readings and in centering circles. He also prepared the silver surfaces of a number of circles for reg1·atluation. Whenever the time permitted he worked on the automatic lPve.l-grinder. He b..t.s also mountecl several new reconnoitering telescopes and attached heliotrope fixtures. Mr.)'· Kearney uas made a number of new heliotropes and repaired t.he old ones; these are also being chau.l{cd to have mirrors of standard size for all. In addition to these duties 110 bas repaired druwing instruments, supplied the needed brass work for stands and tdemeters, and executed miscellaneous office work. Yours, 1espectfully, G. N.

REPORT OF' THE HFDROGRAPHIC INSPECTOR FOR THE YE.JR ENDING ,TDNE 30, 1&<4.
UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, October 1, 1884.
DEAR SIR: I have to submit my annual report of the progress of the bydrography, care and construction of vessels, and work incidental thereto, with which I am charged, for the fiscal year ending June30, 1884.
HYDROGRAPHY.

The progress of the work is represented in detail in the reports of the officers in charge of bydrograpbic parties, who have mostly been detailed from those assigned by the Navy Department for Coast Survey duty. It may not be inappropriate, however, to present a synopsis of the work done, in order that a more comprehensive view may be bad of what was accomplished during the year. Owing to the complete exhaustiou of the appropriation for the previous fiscal year most of the parties could do but little more than make an attempt at fittiug out in time to take the earliest possible advantage of the new appropriations. In most cases it was necessary to wait until the actual commencement, of the year (July 1) in order that means might he aYailable for the transportation of the parties, thus delaying the snrve~· until the middle of the working sea8on. ].\fay and June on our northern coast are usually the most favorable months for surveying purposes. The expenses for fitting vessels are nearly the ;;ame for a short season as for a long one, and as ·propriations made by Congress are only 8nfficient for about four months' work we thus lose these two best months in the year. Furthermore, the h~·drographic parties are composed of men detailed frorn the Navy, and their experience ii;; necessary for a proper execution of the work. They are retained as far as practicable from year to ;year, but while unemployed from a want of proper appropriations they are an unavoidable expense to the Government. I would recommend that when Congress proposes in the future to reduce the amonuts which you deem requisite for carrying on the various surveys, that it be requested to reduce the nnmber of subdivisions in the estimates, or authorize a greater limit than ten per cent., to the transfer account. This would pennit a more economical administration of the funds, with fewer parties, and with fully as good results as at present. It is believed it would not, however, euable the Survey to comply with the demands made on it from the commerce of the country for which extra appropriations are needed. The commencement of the fiscal year found the vessels situated as follows: The steamer Illake, Lieut. Commander W. H. Ilrownson, U. S. N., commanding, at work off New York entrance. The steamer A. D. Bache, Lieut. H.B. Mansfield, U.S. N., commanding, at New York, preparing for summer season off New York entrance. The steamer Gedney, Lieut. E. M. Hughes, U. S. N., commanding, at sea, making passage to the coast. of Maine for summer season's work.

Hughes' term having expired, be was relieved from duty in the Coast Survey, and succeeded in command of the steamer Geduey by Lieut. Commander A. S. Snow, U. S. N., who finished the season's work on the coast of Maine which was commenced by Lieutenant Hughes. No other change was made in the commanding officers of the vessels during the summer season. The steamer Blake, after completing the offshore soundings in the approaches to New York, resurveyed Monomoy Pastmge and Black Rock Harbor, Conn., and made several special examinations of reported rocks and dan~ers. The Scoresby, after finishing the survey of Hart and City Islands Harbor, continued work in the vicinity of the eastern end of Long Island Sound and in Shelter Island Harbor. The parties in the field coutinued until about October 15, when they were withdrawn to prepare for their winter season in Boutbern waters. This time was taken to make some changes in t.he organization of the parties, necessitated by the expiration of the terms of servic,of some of the naval officers attached to the survey. Lieut. Commander H. E. Nichols, U. S. N., was deta-0hed from the command of the steamer Hassler and Lieut. Commander .A. S. Snow, ordered to relieve him. Lieut. E. D. F. Heald, was transferred from the Eagre to the command of the Gedney. Lieutenant Beald's health breaking down, he was only able to retain command of the Gedney until May, when he was detached from the vessel, and Lieut. G. 0. Hanns was transferred from the Arago to fill the vacancy. During the winter the party ou the steamer A. D. Bache was engaged in hydrography on the west coast of Florida, finishing the season by an uusucoossful search for sunken wires laid oft' the Florida Heefs in 1868, for the purpose of ascertai11i11g the rate of coral growth. The parts on board the steamer Gedney was surveying the coal'.it of Texas and Louisiana to the eastward of Galveston entrance. The party on boarcl the steamer Arago, with Lieut. G. C. Hanus, U. S. N., in charge, was engaged in surveying Back Bay, North, and North Landing River!'!, N. C., and later ur11ler Liem. J. E. Pi11sbury, U. 8.

Tbe party on board the sloop Steadfast, in charge of Assistant B. A. Colonna, finished the survey of the Indian River and Lake Worth, Fla. Un the Pacific coast the part;r on board the st-0amer McArthur was engaged in hydrographic surveys on the California coast, in the vicinity of Point Buchon and between Salmon Point and Brushy Point. At the end of the fiscal year the following vessels were preparing for the summer Reason's work in the northern waters of the Atlantic coast: The steamers Blake, Bache, Gedney, and Endeavor, and the schooners Eagre, Drift, Ready, and Palinurus; and on the Pacific coast the steamers Hassler and McArthur. 'I'he schooner Earnest, after laying up all winter, was prepared for work in Puget Sound, and proceeded to the vicinity of Sea beck in .June, with Ensign ,J. N. Jordan, U.S. N., in charge. Lieut. Charles T. Forse, U. S. N., when the new appropriation became available for his party expeuses, assumed charge. of the 1mrty. Before passing to other topics, I desire to call your attention to the report of Lieutenant-Commander Nichols, CT. S. N., 011 a rough plane-table used on board the i;teamer Hassler, for making a hydrographic reconnaissance. I have appended to this report a sketch and description made by Ensign J. H. Fillmore, U. S. N., who devised the apparatus. I would remark also, with reference to the water signal, devised by Lieutenant Hanus, and described ou page 3 l of the Anuual Report of the Superintendelit for 1883, that further experience causes it to be commended for economy of construction and ease of placing in position. Oare should be taken, however, to make the signal perfectly firm by wedging the heel, as signals of this kind need to have tile heels firmly wedged to withstand the heaviest gales. I append a list of naval officen; attached to the Survey during the past fiscal sear, showing the date of assignment and detachment of each officer, together with a tal>le giving the names of vessels, their tonnage, &c., in the Coast Survey service during the same period. Also tabular statements showing the actual numbers of officers and of men attached to the several vessels in service at different periods during the fiscal year.
REP .AIRS OF VESSELS.

The reduced appropriation of $27,000, smaller than that of any year 8ince the war, has made it extremely difficult to fulfill any but the most essential requirements in repairing the vessels of the Surve;r. As mentioned in my last annual report, the steam vessels whieh were added to the organizatjion at alw:it the same time, a few years after the war, have almost exceeded the limit of profitable repairs, particularly their boilers. It is impossible t:-0 renew the boilers of all these vessels out of the available appropriation, even if there were no other calls for the moue~-. The steamer Blake seemed to be most in need of them, and was selected as tbe one to be so equipped this ;rear. A contract was made with William J,, Pettit, of Baltimore, Md., in December, 1883, he being the lowest bidder of several firms, for the construction of two boilers, planned under my direction by Passed Assistant Engineer G. H. Kearny, U. S. N., the engineer officer of the ves1:1el. Expe rience bas developed the fact that for the Survey the cylindrical type of boiler affords genemlly the most beneficial results, aml was the form adoptei for the Blake. The steamers Endeavor and Arago, which were fitted a short time since with this clal's of boiler, constructed >ery satisfactorily by the same contractor, proved themselves better steamers. An increase of from 10 to .15 per cent. was made in their speed, on no greater, if as great, a consumptiou of coal. In order to get two boilers in the Blake in the limited spaee occnpieli bs the old ones it became necessary to mo<lif~· the type somewhat by putting flattened surfaces in. the side for a sµace of nine inches, thus giving them an elliptical shape and gaining the necessary height to girn the proper grate and heat.ing surfaces. lt is a source of regret that the boilers ham been delayed in construction beyond the contemplated time allowed in the contract, but it is due the contractor to state that much of the delay was caused by circumstances over which he had no control. While this w<>rk was going on, occasion was taken to line up the main shaft of the engine, dock

the vessel, clean and repair her bottom, put in new brasses, and other incidentals, at a total expenditure of about $5,528. The boiler of the steamer Bache, like those of the Blake, on her return North at the commencement of the year owing to age (about twelve ·years), was found to haYe passed beyond economical repairs. Yet the state of the appropriations made it necessary to again resort to the "patch" system to tide her over another year. This was itttended with some risk, and the weakness of the single boiler, with which she is fitted, was so strongly developed during the surrny on the west coast of Florida, that I questioned whether it would not be advisable to recommend to you that the vessel be retained at Key West until a new boiler could be sent to her. This woulcl have been attended with greatly increased expense, and Lieutenant Mansfield, her commanding officer, decided to attempt the passage north d11l'ing the pleasant weather of the month of June. He accomplished it, very mucl1 to the relief of all concerned. It now becomes a matter of absolute necessity to construct a new boiler before she again goes into active service. Her total expenses for miscellaneous repairs were about
$1,325.32.

The steamer Gednes made the passage to the coast of Texas, with some needed repairs left undone, owing to lack of funds, and the surYey suffered in consequence by the increased amount of coal consumed. It now becom"'s imperative that her broken propeller be replaced, shaft lined up, &c. Her necessary repairs amounted to about $241.69 for year. Having submitted a special estimate for new boilers for the steamer Hassler (which was jncluded in the appropriation passed by Congress for this ~-ear), as little was done to tl1is vessel as was consistent with safet,y and as would enable the party ou board to execute a season's work nearer repairing facilities than when at work in Alaskan waters, where she was previously employed. Plans for new boilers are in course of preparation, and while being put in other important work will be executed. The most important item of sheathing her with wood (referred to in my last report) will ha\"e to be left for some future time. The steamer McArthur's repairs have been comparatively slight during the year, but it is expected that age will soon have made extensive repairs to the boiler necessary. Her commanding officer has persistently urged that she be titted with a steam windlass, not only as a measure of economy in time iu getting under way, but as a matter of safety. During the year Rhe has parted her chains twice, leaving the yessel, in one case particularly, in a very precarious poRition, a report of which, from Lieutenant Taussig, was submitted to you. This lt>arls to the conclusion that her commander's reasonl'l for urging the steam machinery are well founded, and I RhaJl submit an estimate for accomplishing this desirable object. The experience derived from the steam windlasses put in the Bache, Blake, and Hassler during the past four years hal'l been vers satisfactory, and I am led to hope for better results from this Yessel after she has been fitted with a new windlass of the same type. The McArthur's last year's repalr8 amounted to $910.80. The steamer Endeavor has had comparatively little work done to her hull, but l10r deck-houses have been nearly rehnilt; all the work being done by the crew, no mat~rial expense 11as accrued to the Survey. In the engineer's department the smoke-stack has been replaced, and the macl1inery generally overhauled, while the vessel was laid up at New York during tlie winter. This was also mainly done by the force on board the >essel, at little expense. The steamer Baratarht bas been fitted with considerable new planking and guards, quite extensive repairs to her boilers, and is believed to be now in generally good condition. This, with much of the labor performed by shipped men, at a cost of $1,193.15. The Arago has required, to meet cost of repairs, $460.24. The schooner Eagre, as stated in m;v last anuual report, was found to require a thorough calking of her bottom, which was made tlie occasion for replacing her much-needed copper. The work was done at the New York navy-yard, at lower figure1> than were obtained from outside estimates. Her bottom, as might be expected from her history, was found in excellent condition, while the seams showed the necessity for calking this bea"y craft, to prevent working in a sea way. Advantage was taken of her entering the dock to clean and repair the bottom of the Palinurus, thus material1y lessening the <'-Ost for each ; and the dock not being required for other ves-

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

sels at the time, they were allowed to remain out of water for a period of about three weeks, with benefit to the Survey. The Eagre's total expenses for repairs were $2,098.86. The schooner Palinurus was made ready for a seasou's work in I_,ong Island Sound, including cleaning and repairing bottom sheathing, and an extension of the ward-room by sbiftiug the cabin bulkhead, &c. This cha11ge iu tlrn quarters, it is believed, will add to the efficiency of the party and the comfort of the subofficers of the ves:·wl, aud will at the sume time make the same disposition for the chief of party as exists'on the other schooners of her class. Nearly all tllis work was done by the crew, at ii total expense of $11'0.89. The schooner Drift. It was found during the preYious year that to permit· this vessel to make an attempt to solve the problem of anchoring in deep water it \W1Ild be necessary to fit her with uew anchor gear. The great resistance brought on a five and one-half inch hawser, while anchoring off jjle coast of' Florida in three hundred and four hnndred fathoms of water, produced sucl1 a strain as not only to carry away the windlass, but in the stron.g current of the Gulf Stream it was impossible for her to maintain a fixed position. To renied_y this, a steel wire rope seven hundred and fifty f'atbomR long was purchased, a11d the vessel fitted with an it'ou windlass. I regret to state that tbe results were only partially successful. After a slight break down in starting out the gear was found to stand, but the strain on the vessel was such as to CilUSe serious apprehensions for her safoty. Furthermore, the great length of time required in getting the anchor, with ordinary band power, in four hundred fathoms of water, caused the vessel to get into positions of danger when occn p~·iug stations near the shore. It is recommended that the next observations be tried in tite steamer Blake, where, with her steam power, I anticipate successful results. The Drift's repairs have amounted to $1,098.74. The schooner Yukon has liad sails and riggfog refitted and hull and decks calked, being prepared only for quarters for a topographimtl party in Puget Sound. Cost, $1,163.84. The barge Beauty was hauled out of water at l\'faysville, N. J., in the summer of 1881, and in attempti11g to repair her in May, 1888, she was found to be so rotten that it was impossible to move her. To maintain the "complement of vessels" a new bai·ge was built and sent to replace her at a cost of $1,575.10. The sloop Steadfast was fttted for her last season's service in Indian River and Lake Worth, in Florida, at a cost of $75.79. She being of 110 further use to the Survey, and it being impossible to remove her worn out hulk from tlie mud banks on which she had grounded, she was stripped of all her equipments, left where she rested, and her name erased from the list of vessels. The schooner Brisk and steamer Fathomer, as mentioned in my last report, were beyond repairs, and by your direction, being advertised for Rale, were sold to the highest bidders. The Fathomer to Mr. S. Bensinger, of Washington, D. C., for the sum of $207.50, and the Brisk to Messrs. Woodward, Wight & Co., of New Orleans, La., for $210. The schooner Scoresby was repaired for service during the summer of 1883 at a cost of $30.68. The schooner Earnest, likewise commissioned, as well as refitted out in the spring of 1884, at a cost for repairs of $W7.ll. The schooner Ready, under tl1e same conditions as the Earnest, at a cost for repairs of $511.40. The steamer Hitchcock, schooners G. M. Bache aud Hesearch, and sloop Kincheloe were the only vessels on the lii~t not used at some time during the year. One steam launch was purchased to replace the steam launch attached tc the Gedney, which was found to be entirely worn out, at a cost of $2,750. In addition, the 1wweral steam launches called for an expenditure of $1,371.82: to kt>,ep them in order.
OFFICE· WORK.

The routine duties of the office have been ;carried on by the very able assistants, Lieut. J. E. Pillsbury, U.S. N., in charge of the chart corrections, &c., up to January 29, 1884, and after that dat.e by Lieut. Jefferson F. Moser, U.S. N. The special fitness of Lieutenant Pillsbury, with his long experience in the handling of charts,

led me to recommend to you that he be ordered to take charge of the publication of the Coast Pilot of the southern coast, from Cape Henry southward. Entering upon this new work with bis usual zeal, be verified the courses ancl distances with the schooner Heady on the outside coast of Virginia and North Carolina, and with the steamer .Arago those for tlie sounds of North Carolina. Completing this duty, he returned to the office the last of January to prepare his manuscript for the print(lr, which was ready by April 12. He then took charge ol" the steamer .Arago, and proceeded'with his party on board that vessel, making examinations of the coast and inland waters adjoining the coast. as far south as Savannah, Ga., returning in June. The work under his charge has been pushed with the rapidity which its importance requireu, and it is recommended, as there is a general demand for a suitable publication relating to our soutlierl}c, coast, this manuscript be gi,·en preference in printing over all but the most important office publications. It is a matter for congratulation that the Navy Department should have detailed an oflicer of Lieuteuant Moser's well-known standing as a h~·drographer for another tour of duty in the Survey, and with tliese two officers left in charge of the office it gave me the opportunity to devote most of my attention t~ the important work of the year, the construction of the steamer Carlile P. Pat. terson. '.l.'he draughtsmen of the office, Messrs. E. Willenbiicber, W. C. Willenbi.icher, and F. 0. Donn, have efficiently carried on their various duties. .A synopsis from the records of the hydrographic sheets plotted by them I present below, and a detailed statement of their work iR made a matter of record in this office :

In addition to his extensirn clerical dutimi, Mr. E. H. Wyvill has assisted very materially in making tracings and preparation of data properly belonging to the draughtsmen, but which, owing to the accumulation of rcco1'lls, the force was unable to take in hand.
CONSTRUCTION~OF

VESSELS.

In anticipation of Congress taking some action in the appropriation bill for the fiscal year 1883 for the "construction of a steamship for the survey of the Pacific coast and sounds," plans and specifications were prepared under my direct.ion after the general type of vessels which had given such good results in the Survey. Through the courtesy of Naval Constructor S. H. Pook, at the navy-yard, Washington, D. C., Mr. Frothingham, the draughtsman of his department, prepared the drawings and model with much credit to himself, and otherwise gave me valuable assistance. The action of Congress being favorable to the prQject, bids were asked for as prescribed by law, and on June 1, 1883, were opened, as per advertisement, and the following records were made:

Mr. James D. J,eary being the lowest responsible bidder, and his facilities for building such a vessel as was required proving satisfactory, a contract for her construction was made wit11 him by yon 011 .July 1, 1883. Your directions appointing me the inspector on the part of the Govflrnment, and assigning Lieut. R. Clover, U.S. N., and Passed Assistant Engineer H. N. Stevew,;on, U.S. N., as my assistants, were received, and under them the following assignments made: Lieutenant Clm·er, who had been associated with me in the preparation of the data from the inception of the project or building a vessel especially adapted to the surn\y of Alaskan waters by your predecessor, Mr. Carlile P. Patterson, was stationed at New York, taking the immediate charge of the work, aud under his constant watchfulness nearly every timber and bolt that we11t into the construction of the vessel received careful inspection. It is believed that the scheme of having the officer on whom wa:,; to rest the responsibility of a long voyage to the Pacific, aud afterwards possible trying cir· cumstances on the coast of Alaska, associated iu the construction of the Yessel hai_; been fraught with good results to the Government as well as to himself as her future commander. That be acquitted himself with credit you well know. Mr. Stevenson was located at Philadelphia, Pa., where the steamer's machinery was being made by Messrs. Neafie & Levy. This officer, as men· tioned in my last report, bad also been associated with me in planning the machinery, and, as her fut1ue engineer officer, was deeply interested in the careful construction of the moti,·e power of the vessel. This arrangement of the duties left me to proceed from point to point where I was needed to decide questions of construction, and t,o see that all workmanship and material was fir:st class aud satisfactory to the inspeot,or. As I propose to submit to you a complete report of tlie constructiou, equipment, and the trials of the vessel, I shall only mention in passing that her keel was laid Augm;t L 188:), and she was launched January 15, 1884. A satisfactory trial was made down New York Bay to Sandy Book light, ship May 5, 1884, and later a sea voyage covering over forty-eight hours, ending at W ~shington, D. C., June 5. As she was not completely fittetl for ller passage to the Pacific coast at the date on which this report <iloses, I prefer to make a full report after :ill the data concerning her trials are received. Very respectfully submitted. C. M. CHESTER, Commander, Unitrd State11 Sary, Hydrographic Inspector U. S. <Joast and Geodetic Survey. Prof. J.E. HILGARD, Superintendent Coast and Geodetic Survey.

DESCRIPTION OF A METHOD OF SKETCHING IN SHORE-LINE, WHEN MAKING PRELIMINARY OR RUNNING SURVEYS, AVOIDING THE NECESSITY OF ESTIMATING DIS'fANCES OR OF DEPEND· ING ON THE EYE TO GET THE CONFIGURATION OF THE SHORE-LINE.

By Ensign J. H.

FILLMORE,

U. S. N., attached to the party of L-ieut. Commat1det· H. E. Ni.chols, r. 8. X., .Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey.

The instrument is a modification of the plane table, and oonsists of a plane table or drawing board, mounted on a tripod, and two rulers. One ruler is attached to the edge of the board so as to move freely in the direction of its length across the board, with room underneath it for the sketching paper. This ruler is pointed at one end, and graduated from that end as zero. The other is an ordinary straight-edge ruler, with sights at the ends. To sketch in a shore-line, the ship or boat is to run along the shore at as uniform a speed as possible, an cf with as few courses as is consistent with keeping at a convenient distance from the Fi~. 1. shore. The distance from the shore being determined b;r the minuteness of the details which it iii desired to see and record, the board is mounted on the deck so as to command as much of the

horizon as possible. The pointed ruler is to be parallel to the ship's track. Ordinarily this will be parallel to the keel; but if the ship is making drift or steeriug a range, then it is parallel to the actual course and not to the keel. A line drawn along the edge of this ruler will L>e the ship's track on the paper. The graduations of this ruler are in time, so that if at any instant the point of the ruler is at the ship's position on the paper, then at any other time, say three minutes later, the point may be moved to the ship's new position by moving the ruler ahead three minutes, or three divisions of its graduation. Thus, at any instant when the ship is moving along the shore, the point of this ruler may be put at her position on the paper by moving it forward the prOJ)er number of time graduations, a watch being before the draughtsman for r.hat purpose. Now, t-0 put in the shore, take bearings of points on the shore with the sighting ruler, having its edge against the

'

134

UNITED ST.ATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

point of the other ruler, the latter point being at the proper time or place in the ship's track, and draw these bearings on the paper. As soon as more than one bearing is taken of the same point on shore from different places · or times in the ship's track that point is fixed by the intersection. It is in fact a triangulati'ln on the point, with the ship's track as a base line. By selecting points as they come in sight on the !Jow, taking a bearing then, one when it is nearly abeam, and another when well abaft the beam, good angles can always be made. It is not necessar,y, of course, to wait for even minutes or divisions of the rnler, but at any instant when a bearing is wanted move the ruler to the proper place, estimating the fractions of minutes between the divisions. The whole shore-line is thus put in b;y cutting in points as the ship goes by them. To change the course, moYe the paper through the angle of change about the point of the ruler, occupying the ship's position at the time of turning. The edge of the pointed ruler will then be on the ship's new track. This angle ma~- be laid off with a protractor, or, if the ship is to head for a visible point, the new track may be drawn with the sighting ruler just before turning, and the paper then turned until the edge of the pointed ruler is along the new tr~k. When the sketch is between known points, as these are passed they are to be cut in the same as other points of the shore-line. Or the ship may be cut in by tlJe angles on signals or known objects. Then, when plotting the work, the ship's track is laid down from one known point towards the other, and the other known point is plotted from the sketch. Then, all known errors baying been eliminated, the uifference between the plotted position of the point and its proper poeition is an error, which must be distributed throughout the ship's track. This may be done as shown in Figure 4:

A

Fig.!tc.
The full Jine represents the plotted track and the broken line the corrected one, the dotted lines are drawn through the points where the course was changed and parallel to the line through the plotted and true positions of the second known point. The distances Bb Oc, &c., are laid off of such lengths that Bb: AB= E F: .A. D and Cc: A C = E F: .A. D, &c., thus proportioning the errors throughout the track. When there is only one known point, a run may be made along the shore-line to be put in and back to the same point; then plotting the whole course, the error in the final position of the point can be distributed in the same manner. If the steering is bad or difficult, the draughtsman can, by noting the bearing of some object direct!~- ahead, know when the ship is exactly on. her course, and by only taking bearings then, can make the method nearly independent of bad steering. If when this precaution is taken the bearings of points do not intersect well, then the pointi:ld ruler is not parallel to the ship's actual course. This should be corrected by turning the table until the pointed ruler is in the right direction, and when the change in drift is equivalent to a change in course, the paper should also be turned in the opposite direction the same as for a change in the course; a note being made of the course made good. The ship should be cal'efu11y logged and a record kept of the courses and distances made good, to be used in plotting the work. If in asinttbe rulers the pointed one be found to be unsteady, or the end not t;o remain cl<>Be to the paper, a }>aper-weight may be -used to bold it in place when taking a bearing.

TABLES FOR THE PROJECTION OF MAPS, BASED UPOX A POLYCONIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE CLARKE SPHEROID, AND COMPVTEp FlWM THE EQUATOR TO THE POLE.

The tables here given for the projection of niaps upon a polycouic development are hased upon our knowledge of the dimensions and figure of the earth as derived by Colonel Clarke, H. E., in 186fl. They a.re intended to supersede all former projection tables pulllished by the Surwy, and for greater usefulness have been extentle1l to include the entire quadrant from the equator to the pole. Up to the year 1880, the elements of the earth's magnitutle and figure derived from Bessel ball been in use for the representation of all geographical positions, and upon them were based the projection tables published in the Coast Survey Reports for 1853, 1856, 1859, and 1865. These elements were: Equatorial semi-axis a= 6377397.2 meterl'; polar semi-axis b = 6:)50079.0 meters
a : b : : 299.153 :
298.15~~

The projection tables whiclt appeared in the Report for 18i>3 (A11pendix 39) were the earliest published by the Coast Survey, aud were accompanietl b~· an exposition of the method antl its special adaptations prepared by E. B. Hunt, U. S. A., Assistant in the Coast Survey. In the Heport for 18.)(i (Appendix 58) were published "'l':iblC'S for prqjecting maps of large exteut, arranged by Assistant. J. E. Hilganl.'' These tal>les were afterward extended by Mr. Hilgard aud republished in Appendix 3~~ Heport for 1859; a further extension, making the tables applicable w the pr·\iection of a map of )l°orth America, appeared in the Report for 1865, Appendix 20. Iu the Report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1880 (Appendix No. 15) Assistant C. A. Schott gives in a very compact form a statement of much that is of practical importance l>eariug upon the su~ject of different prqjections, comparing them with the polyconic projection for relative value and precision. In 1882 was publii;hed by the Sur¥ey a "Treatise on Pr~jections, by Thomas Craig, Ph.D.," wltich discusses and develops the mathematical principles upon which all the various forms of pro· jections depend. Additional and more precise measurements ha,·ing- been made in many parts of the earth, notably in India, since the publica.tion of the Bessel elements in 1837 aud 1841, they were C('mpared nnd combined by Col. A. R Clarke, H.. E. at the British On1nauct~ Sun·e_y Office, and were publishetl in the volume," Comparisons of the Starnlat'ds of Length, &c., made at the Ordnance Survey Office, Southampton, 186tl." He gi\·es for the two semi-axes a l'esnltiug value:
n = 6 378 206.4 meters.

the general dimensions would so far affect the territory of the United States as to make it useful to seek a better general surface of projection for this country. In the Report for 1875 (Appendix 19) tables were given for converting certain co-efficients and arcs from the Bessel to the Clarke spheroid of 1866, and in February, 1880, the latter spheroid was formally adopted for use on the survey. In Appendix No. 7 to the present volume is given a new edition of the tables for the computation of geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths. The formulre used in the following tables are the same as those printed in the projection tables of 1853 and 1856, varying in the numerical >alues only to suit the dimensions of the new spheroid. For lengths of degrees of the meridian (Dm) and parallel (D~) they now become

ARRANGEMENT AND EXPLANATION OF THE TABLES,

The unit of linear measure of the Coast and Geodetic Survey is the meter, and the relation of the meter to the yard now in use upon the work is that derived by Captain Clarke, R. E., in 1866, from comparisons of new British standards, with several well accredited copies of the meter. In a paper published as Appendix No. 22 to the Coast Survey Report for 1876, and in an amplified edition of this paper which appeared as Appendix No. 12 to the Report for 1877, Assistant J.E. Hilgard has given a statement of the relation of the lawful standards of measure of the United States to those of Great Britain and France, and has presented a concise record and discussion of the observations upon which rest the relations assigned to difterent standards of length. The ratio of the yard to the meter as stated by Clarke, namely: 1 meter= 1.093623 yard =39.370432 inches, is that used in the first and second conversion tables. Other tables are for the conversion of meters into statute and nautical miles. The length of a nautical mile in use upon the survey, upon which these tables are based, namely, 1 nautical mile= 1853.248 meters= 6080.27 feet is that given by J. E. Hilgard, Superintendent, in his paper on the subject published in Appendix No. 12, Report for 1881. On pages 140 and 141 are table of lengths of degrees of the parallel, for every half degree Of latitude, from the equator to the pole, and a table of lengths of each degree of the meridian. Then follow the Projection Tables, so arranged that all values expressed in them from any degree of latitude to the next greater degree shall be before the reader without the necessity of turning a page. On the left of each double page are given the values of ares of the parallel for every minute of latitude and from 1" to 5' of longitude.

On the right of each double page are the corresponding rnlne8 of all meridional arcs from 111 to 1 o so arranged that intermediate mines may be taken out at will. If it is desired to know the number of meters between latitude 400 05' 25" and 400 45' 45" we turn to the page for Lat. 40 of the tables and find in ('Olunm headed sum of minutes
9252.Sm 1'3280.0 74027.2 = 616.9 74644.1 =Length of arc required. On the same page are given the values of the co-ordinates X arnl Y for differences of longitude up to 300 on each side of the central meridian.

Having fixed the limiting meridiaus and parallels and the scale, draw a meridian line as near!~· through the center of the sheet as possible. Take from the tables of meridional arcs the distances from the northern limiting l)arallel to the center and thence to the l'iOutheru limit of the projection, and lay off these distances from an assumed point iu the central line near the top of the s!Jeet. From the three poiuts thus found draw three lines perpendicular to the central meridian entirel;1· across the sheet, and test their precision by diagonal measures. L:1y off 011 each of the peqwudiculars both east and west of the central meridian, the tabular ordinates (X) for the latitudl· of the perpendicular, and for the longitudes intended to be covered between meridians upon tl1e pr~jec tion when completed. At eacll point (X 1) (X 2 ) (X 3 ), &c., thus found, lay off the correspoudiug co·ordinate (Y) parallel to t,!Je central meridian. Through the three poi11ts (Y) at each perpendicular draw meridian liues with great care. In all pr~jections on single sheets coveriug an area of moderate extent, say ~00 miles square, these lines will be so nearly straight that their cun·ature cannot be detected in drawing the meridians. Next divide the spaces between the points Yon each meridian into convenient equal parts of the same value as the spaces taken between the meridians. <;Jurved lines drawn through the points thus found will represent parallels and will complete the projection.

FORMUL1E AND FACTORS FOR THE COMPUTATION OF GEODETIC LATITUDES, LONGITUDES, AND AZIMUTHS.
[Third edition.*]

When the geographical co-ordinates of latitude and longitude of a point on the earth's surface, and the distance and azimuth to another point are known, we may treat the problem of computing the latitude and longitude of the second point and the reverse azimuth in two different ways. We may either solve the spheroidal triangle formed by tbe two points and the pole as a whole, a.rrh·ing at trigonometrical functions of the sought co.latitude, azimuth and difterence of longitude; or we may seek expressions for the differences of the sought from the given data. The former or direct method has the inconvenience of requiring the u11e of ten places of deci· mals in the computation, in order to give the positions with a degree of exactness corresponding to that of the known distance between the two points, while the second leads to very convenient expressions, on account of the smallness of the differential arcs in most cases of triangulation. When, however, the arc between the two points reaches several degret>s in length, tbe direct method must be resorted to. This solution has been very completely and elegantly performed by BESSEL, and is given in Astronom. Nachrichten, No. 86, 1826. Adopting the second method, we follow in the main PUISSANT ( Tra.ite de aeodesie),t in the development of the difference of latitude of two points on the spheroid in terms of the distance, azimuth and latitude of the given point. It will be convenient first to recall the expressions of several lines of an ellipse in terms inrnlving the latitude, L, which is the angle that the normal to any point on the ellipse makes with the major axis. Designating the major or equatorial semi-axis by a,, and the minor or polar semi-axis by b, then the ellipticity or ratio of their difference to the former is

The radius of curvature, R, and the normal, N, are the principal fonctions used in geodesy. It will be observed that radii of curvature for different latitudes do not intersect unless produced, and that when the~· lie in different meridian planes on the spheroid they will not intersect at all. A, B_, in l<'ig. 2, are two points on a spheroid of revolution, having the latitudes L, L', and joined by the geodetic liue AB= s, making the angles with the meridian, PAB = 180-Z, PEA= Z' -1800, The azimuths, z, are reckoned from sot:th around by west in consequence of the latitmlps being reckoned from the equator toward the poles, by settled custom, without~which the meridional co-ordinate of a }JOint would be more properly measured from the pole, and the azimuth of a line reckoned from the north. The angle APB, between the two meridional planes passing through ..11 and B, i8 _the difference of their longitudes, M, M1, which being reckoned positive to the westward, we have 1\1'-M=dM. Furthermore, An, Bn', Ar, Br', indicate the normals, N, N' ' and the radii of curvature in the meridiau, R, R', at the points A and B. This being premised, and the latitude L of the point A being given, as well as the length K of the geodetic line AB, and its azimuth z, we propose to find the latitude L' of the point B, the angle dM, and the reverse azimuth Z', by solving the geodetic triangle ABP. Writing it, 1', for the co-lattudes, !; for 1800 - Z, ands for the arc AB, referred to radius = I, we have, in a spherical triangle, for,\' the following equation: cos il'= cos i\. cos 8 +sin 1 sin 8 cos

e

Observing now thats is always a small arc, rarely exceeding 10, and generally less than 30', we can develop the increment of,\. with reference to that of s in a rapidly converging series, and will have, by Taylor's theorem

It be readily seen that the inst t.erm expresses the distance on the meridian P B from B to p, tbe foot of the perpendicular from A ; the second trm 1 the distance very nearly from p to the parallel passing through A; while the third term is a further approximatiou, and so on. Referring now our case to a sphere, having the radius equal N, or its center at the point where the normal .A n intersects tbe polar diameter of the spheroid, we have

(c)

This difference of latitude is, however, referred to a sphere whose radius is N, and requires still to be transformed by referring it to one whose radius is the radius of curvature in the meridian for the middle latitude, Rm. Since we do not at first know the middle latitude, it is more convenient to refer to the radius of curvature I~ of the starting-point, the latitude of which is known, and then seek the small correction due to the ratio of R to Rm. l\fultiplying, then, equation (c) by in seconds of arc, we get

which formula, although of a somewhat complicated derivation, is very simple and convenient in practical computation with the aid.of the tabulated factors, B, C, D, E. The term· (o L? Dis lwre interposed between the second and third terms of the series proper, because the latter is frequent!~· uot required, being insemiible when the dil$tance K is less than about 10 miles, or log Kin meters less than 4.23 The term (o L) 2 D 8hould ue used whenever log h exceed8 2.31, and h2 may be u8ed for (r~ Ji)2 in all cases where log K does not exceed 4.90 Tim term depending on the fourth differe11tial co-officient, neglected in equation (a), never exceedi:; 0" .001 for s = 1°, or K = 100 000 meters, and may therefore be safely neglected in practice. For secondary triangulation, and when the sides do not exceed about 12 miles, or 20 000 meters, the formula (1) may be advantageously reduced to the following:
(2)

In order next to deduce the angle A P B between the meridional planes passing through A and B and intersecting in the polar axis, or the difference d M of the longitudes M and M' of the points A and B, co11nted from east to west, we avail ourselYes of the latitude L' of B, which has become known b~- the previous calculation, and have simply, using the same notation as before

In order to correct for the assumption that the small arcs s and d M are proportio11al to their sines, we use a table giYing the differences of the logarithms of the ares and sines.

This term is only 0".01 when log d M=3.36 and need never be used for secondary triangulation. A convenient table for finding cos i d Lis given ou page 373. In the :first and second editions the tables were based upon the supposition that the earth is a spheroid of revolution, having its equatorial semi-diameter a=6 377 397.2 meters its polar semi-diameter b=6 356 079.0 meters and, consequently a : b=299.153 : 298.153

as derived by BESSEL, in .Astronom. Nachrichten, Nos. 333 and 438, 1837 and December 1841, from the ares measured up to that time. All geodetic computations made in the Coast Survey between 1844· aud February, 1880, were based upon those elements. Ver~' considerable additions have, however, been made to our knowledge of the figure and magnitude of the earth since Bessel's time. A late combination is that made by Col. A. R. Clarke, H. E., of the British Ordnance Sun'er, and published in "Comparisons of Standards of Length, made at the Ordnance Office, Southampton, 1866." He finds a=6 378 206.4 meters b=6 356 583.8 meters consequently He also finds, by elaborate comparisons, that 1 meter=39.370432 inches which may well be taken as the most accurate value now known. This spheroid of 1800 was · adopted in the survey by Superintendent Patterson in 1880. In the present edition the tables of the log fact-Ors A, B, c, D, E, have been conformed t-0 the Olarke spheroid. The following exa.mples will further illustrate the use of the formulre and tables.
· Before 1844 a ditferent spheroid of reference was employed by Superintendent Ha.ssler.

TnE INVERSE PRODLEM.-There are cases wlien it is required to compute tlie distance and azimuth between two points that are given by their latitudes and longitudes. This problem is of comparatively rare occurrence, aml it lia:s not been found necessary to construct special forrnulre and blank forms for it since it can readily Le solved by using those pro,·ided for the case heretofore treated. This is done by dividing d M=K sin Z. A' sec L' b~· the first term for dL, h=K cos Z. B,
d:\I L . Bh. which would give us the azimuth at once if we knew h, dM being A' sec ' . gi"en. 'Ve therefore seek to compute the smaller terms for the difference of latitude, in order to obtain h hy subtracting tLem from the known dL. The only addition to the usual form is the term, log tan Z=log (K sin Z)-log (K cos Z). K will best be taken from the term h when sin Z is greater than cos and from the term dM when the reverse is the case. When the distance K is large, as in primary triangulation, it will he necessary to introduce the correction for dM due to difference of ratio bet ween sine and arc, using the form for primar,y L. M.

FORMULA AND 'l'ABLE FOR COMPUTING THE SPHERICAL EXCESS OF TRIANGLES.

375

In every spherical triangle the excess of the sum of the three angles over 1soo bears the same ratio to eight right angles as the area of the triangle bears to that of the whole sphere. Putting e .1 . e th e excess, we h ave 4"-;f E h area. r ior raums, e ior = area -~;i' ence E = ri·· In ord er to express e in sec-

4

onds of arc, we must divide the expression by sin 1". The area of the triangle, when it is small in relation to the whole sphere, as is the case in all geodetic triangles, may be expressed with suffi. cient accuracy for this purprn~e by ~ A B sin c, where A and B are two sides and c the included angle. We have then

e = 2 r' sin 1,-; Iu estimating e in a triangle on the terrestrial spheroid, we can refer it to an osculating sphere, the radius of which is taken as the mean of the radii of curvature in the meridian and prime vertical at the center 9f the triangle. These are respectively

The mean of these two expressions developed, but embracing only terms below the fourtli power of e, is i (R + N) =a (1 - i e2 cos 2 L + .. ) We have, therefore, for the spheroidal triangle, AB sin c E= . 2 a2 (1-! e2 cos 2 L) 2 sin 1" for which we write E = AB sin c x m, and tabulate the logarithms of m = ~-- ! e" I ----.--·· 2a · COS 2 ~) Blll 1 11 for different latitudes.

THE RUN OF THE l\HUROMETER.
By GEORGE DAVIDSON, A"sistant.

CO.A.ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

TVashington, January 15, 1885. DEAR STR: I herewitb transmit the paper upon "Tlle Run of the .Micrometer," which you asked for a sllort time since iu response Mm,v meutiou that it bad been of such use to the ,rouuger members of m.r party aud to others that. this fact seemed to warrant its puhlicatiav among Uw append ices of your report. Yours, respectfull.r, GEORGE DA VIDSOX, A.<1si;;tant. Prof. J. E. HILGARD, Superintendent Coast and, Geo1lctic Sui·v&y.

THE RUN OF THE MICROMETER. The term '' run of the micrometer" occurs in the microscope-micrometer measurement of fractional parts of the arc between two adjacent graduations on the circle of an a:;;trouomical or geodetic instrurnent. If the adjacent graduations are 5' or 300" apart the microscope-micronrnter is so adjusted that the image of a given point 011 the micrometer thre.ad iu traversiug the cl1ord betweeu the two graduatious (or the tangents pamllel to the chord) shall exhibit exactl;v 300 1livisiom1 or sec0111lR of arc. Iu this case there is no run of the micrometer. But should the micrometer record more or less than the prescribed seconds of graduation, this difterence is the nm of tlw ·micrometer iu terms of the arc value of the micrometer divisions. In practice we find the following facts and conditions as the basis for our im·estigatio11 to determine the apportionment of the run for the different fractional parts of the arc measure11. The circle is graduated to any gh'en number of mi11utes of arc, usuall,\· fiYe. The m1meration of the graduations upon the circle may increase, as the numbers on the watch face, or the reverse. The microscope-micrometer measures the arc which the zero line of tht" micrometer has passed over and beyond the last graduation of reterence. · The micrometer screw is generally cut to make on_e r1:wolutio11 for one minute of arc, and the head of the screw is usnaHy divided into sixty equal parts, intended to represent secouds of arc. .At each observation there are ma<le two pointings and "readings'' of eaeh micrometer-one pointing and ''reading" on the gra,duation followf'ng the micrometer line of zt·ro, L e., on the gmtlu· ation last passed by tlie micrometer line of zero, or fiducial line; the other pointing and "reading'' on the grad'Uation preceding the same micrometer line of zero, i. e., on the graduation uot .vet reached by the micrometer line of zero.

The "back reading"· is the desig11atio11 used for the record of the micrometer 1ioi11ting 011 the graduation following the micrometer line of zero. The "forward reading" is the designation used for the record of the micrometer pointing on the graduation preceding the micrometer line of zero. When the micrometer is turnetl backwards to the last graduation passerl h;r tlie zpro 1ii1P th<· numbers on the micrometer head increase. Therefore the" forward" reailing iomhtracted from the "hack" reading plus the whole revolutions~ gives the number of micrometer <livisiom; in the llv('minute space.
CONDITIONS.

(a) If the graduations of the circle were equidistant throughout the circle; (b} If the microscope-micrometei. and the graduation were concentric; i. if there Wf\l'f' no eccentricity of the graduation; (c) If the microscope-micrometer screw made exactly one revolution for one minute of arc; (d) If changes of temperature did not change the distance of the micrm;copc-mieromctcr from the center of rotation of the circle; (e) If' cha11ges of temperature did not change the distance of the objective of the microi;co1w from the graduated arc; (f) If cllanges of temperature did not change the distance. of the objective of the microRcop<' from the plane of the micrometer thread; (g) If' the micrometer thread moved always in a plane parallel to the plane of the gradnati011N on the circle; (lt) If the micrometer screw moved alwa~·s at right angles to the radius denoted h,y tke zero lirie of the micrometer ; (i) If the graduated circle did not warp from changes of temperature, or from mechanical strains in changing "position," &c.; (j) If the observer made perfect pointings and readings on the graduations; (k) If the micrometer line of zero remained unchanged between the "back" and "forwartl" rradi11gs; ( l) If the movement of the zero line were uniform throughout each revolution of tlw Rerew; (ni) lf the chord or parallel tangent of a very small arc were identical with the Ieng-tli of the arc; Then the part of the arc to be measured by the microscope micrometer would be !lct.(·rmim·<l at once hy simply measuring from the line of zero to the graduation following, that is, m(·asnri11g· backwards to the graduation last passed by the line of zero, and thus reading off dimetly tlw Hlltall arc betwepn that graduation and the line of zero. Bnt n01ie of these conditions are realized in practice, and, if eacl1 of the intergmtluatiou space:s throughout the circle has not been absolutely determined, we must assume: (I) That the graduations throughout the circle may be equidistant, but thP mieroscop<'microml'lt·r may he in such imperfect adjustment that one revolution of the screw doeR 11ot, conform to tl1e prescribed unit of arcs (that is, the distance apart of two contiguous graduat.ionR). (:l) 'l'hat, if errors of graduation exist, the graduation following and the graduation l·l'ee1·11ing the mi('I'ometer line of zero are equally displaced, and in contrary directions. (:3) 'l'hat the changes in the distance of the objective of the microscope-micrometer from tl1e tJl:tnc of the graduated circle; changes in the distance of the plane of the micrometer thread from the ohjective of the microscope'; changes in the parallelism of the planes of the micrometn threatl and the graduated circle; changes in the distance of the axis of the micrometer screw from tlJt· <~euter of rotation of tbe circle, &c., all displace the images of the forward and back gr:ulnalPd liueR efprnlly and in opposite directions.

arc has ueeu di8t11rlletl in the vertical plane of the instrument passing through the center of rotat,io11 and the zero line of the micrometer, the images of the forward and back graduations are equally displaced and in opposite directions. (5) That, if the line of zero has changed in azimuth, the forward aud back readi11g8 are equally aftected and in opposite directions. (6) These changes are supposed to take place between the readings of the back arnl forwarcl gm1luations. (7) That in the pointing on each graduation the observer makes equal errors which l1ave the same sign or which have opposite signs. It ii,; evident that these assumptions are similar in character, and that in consequcuce of the existence of any or all of them, one revolution of the micrometer screw moves the zero thread through a11 arc (rigorously along the chord of a very small arc, or along the tangents parallel thereto) not of the constant value of 60" but of 60" + r. This quantity r exhibits itiself as the diftereuce between the uack and forward readings of the micrometer, and is the" run" of the microscope-micrometer. Autl it is also evident that the proper point from which to measure the micrometer part of the arc is the middle point, between each two consecutive graduations. In order, therefore, to obtain the most probable value of the fractional arc measured by the microscope-micrometer, when the readings of the pointings upon the two adjacent graduations difter, it is necessary to determine a correction to each reading, or to either or to the mean of the two readings based upon the preceding considerationR : li'or this investigation let us make: D = the mea1i value in micrometer divisions of the space between every two cousccntfre graduations of the whole circle. b = the position of the zero line of the micrometer referred to the graduation last passed,.in micrometer divisions; and denominated the "back" reading of the miorometer. If tlrn zero line js between the graduation last passed and the middle point of the two graduations, the "forward" reading is referred to the "back" reading by means of D. And (supposing three equally or nearly equidistant microscopeR) in the reductions,

b= A+:+ C where the three "back" readings of the microscope-micrometers are A, B, and C.
f
= the position of the zero line of the micrometer referred from the graduation not yet reached by it, and denominated the "forward" reading of the micrometer. If the

zero line is between the middle point of the two graduations, and the graduation uot ;yet reached, the "JJack" reading h; referred to the forward reading by means of D. And in the reductions

f =A'+~{'+ C', where the three "forward" readings of the microscope-micrometers are A', E',
and C'. e:, = (300 + b ) - f = the observed number of micrometer divisions between the two givt.m graduations; and always very nearly equal to D. d = 6 -D. 1ri = ~ (b + f) = the observed position of the zero line of the micrometer, as referred to two actual graduations. 1\1 = The corrected position of the zero line of the micrometer as referred to two mean gmduations, taking the place of the two actual graduations. lt' the" forward" and the" back" readings of the micrometer poiutings are ident,ieal (that is, if b =f), then 6 = D, and no correction is required to either reading, nor to the mean of both; and the position of the zero line of the micrometer is given directly by b, or by;; or by 111, which is equal to M in this case. But if the forward and back readings differ, then a correction is ue-eessary to each reading, b andf, or to eith~r of them, or to m, the mean of both. And it is evident th·, in application, the quantity 6 - D ml!St be a11portioned to the two dis· cordant micrometer readings; that is, to the two observed discordant positious of the .zero line. This correction, as already defined, is the "run of the micrometer," and is represented by r.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The tabulation of the actual run, r, of the microscope-micrometers through a series of observations at a station indicates whether any change has taken place in the value of the run from some known or unknown cause. If this change is establisliell, the mean values of the run must be taken for the different periods when the microscope-micrometers were supposed to be under the same conditions. For example, it is evident, from au inspection of the following tabulation of the actually observed run of the microscope-micrometers (each result being the mean of three micrometers), at Station Northwest Yolo Base, tiiat througll some unexplained cause a change took place between numbers 42 and 4:l, and again bebw~en numbers 124 and 125; so that three values of the mean run fJ are nsed in the office reductions at this station. As the run was cleri\-ed from the mean of the readings of the three microscope-micrometers, A, B, and C, no clew is gi\·m1 by this tabulation for judging· whether one micrometer or more than one was affected. It would require the tabulation of the actual run for each microscope-micromet.er to establish which of them underwent change. of adjustment; but the labor of reduction would be doubled and nothing esseutial would be gained.

SFRVEY OFFICE, Computing IHrision, 1lforc/t 27, 1884. DEAR Sr&: The otlice computation of the triangulation connecting Lakes Uhamplain and Onatrio has just been completed by J\Ir. Doolittle. The rapidity and correctness with which the work was executed are very creditable to the computer. The following results, comparisons, and remarks are respectfully submitted. The total development is about mo statute miles, and all needful particulars about the stations are shown on the accompanying triangulation sketch. (See plate No. 20.) The horizontal directions at each station were adjusted as mmal; the probable error of an observation of a direction· (consisting of pointing and reading, telescope D, and pointing and reading, telescope R) comes out as follows:

By request ot the observer no use was made of the resulting direction from day measures in the present figure adjustment, but the value· had been used in the first office adjustment then terminating with the line Pen Mountain to Tassel.t The difference in the two adjustments for the observed direction is 1".742, by which amount (nearly) each of the two ·triangles Pen Mountain, Mount Hamilton, Otsego and Pen Mountain, Mount Hamilton, Tassel are improved in the sum of their angles; the side equation involved is also improved. The present adjustment gives but the trifling correction of -0".061 to the observed night-direction. Between the sides Prospect-Helderberg and Oswego-Sodus there are 4 quadrilaterals with a pentagon including a quadrilareral, giving rise to 24 conditions; these were satisfied by application of the method of least squares. No notice was taken of the direction Loomis to Mannsville. The triangulation of the United States Lake Survey joins that of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in a figure around the central station Victory. The adjusted triangles of the Lake Survey, which connect the Sandy Creek base with the line Sodus-Oswego, selected to show the closeness of agreement, were verified and recomputed. We have the following comparisons:

This azimuth comparison is less favorable than the position comparisoll, ~·et the correction to the triangulation would be small if we were to adjust distance and azimuth and have 26 in the plae of 24 conditions. The following is added as further iilustrnting tlw character of the work. The mean error 111 of an angle is frequently employed as a characteristic of accuracy of the angular mea1rnres of a triangulation. Supposing the directions obsern~d at each station adjmited (Bessel's method), thPn the additional corrections demanded hy the subsequent figure adjustment will giYe a Yalue of 111, viz:

We may also note tlu~ result that of the 23 triangles the closing error is 15 timeR positive -and but 8 times negative. This may be accidental.

These rough comparisons are quite satisfactory, aJl(l in particnlar the longitudinal differ«nce, which is of great· irnportanee in our own line; it may he reduced to - l".4 b,,- applying the correction found at Oswego. The spheroid emplo;yed in both survess appears to amrwcr for tltis western region. Our knowledge of the western boundary line of Pennsylvania, which is connected with tl1e Lake Survey, will also he impro\'ed, since a comparison of geodetic aurl astronomical lougitudes may now be made by the Boundary Commission.

These ouservatious and results constitute a decided adYance iu geodetic hypsometry and tllcy have enabled me to giYe a practical test to the theory of refraction as presented by Dr. \V .·Jordan t by applying· to it tbe rl'sults to the vertical measures of the primary triangulation of Central California.

Prof. C. Fearnley's contribution to the theory of terrestrial refraction appended t.o the proceedi11gs of the Seventh International Geodetic Coulerence at Rome, 1883, Berlin, 18~, was received too late for consideration in the present paper [Nov., 1881.-Sch. -] 391

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The theor;y itself starts from Laplace's differential equation to a ray of light passing through our atmosphere, and a,fter introlluci11g certitin simplifications for the purpose of adapting the expression to terrestrial refraction, tlie meteorological elements are iutrodnced by means of the expression of the ratio of density of t,he air at the upper and lower stations. Full use is made of the author's barometric fonnu1a, but the distinctive feature of the method lies in the direct introduction of the law of deerease of atmospheric temperature with altitude-all of which bas been referred to in Appendix No. l~, Report for 1883 (pp. :308-313.) In the absence of simultaneous reciprocal mear;ures of zenith distances we are obliged to procure in some way suitable values for the coefficient of refraction; even were such observations available, the knowledge of this coefficient could only be dispensed with in the computation for differences of heights under certain restrictions, viz, we have to assume its value to be the same at the upper and at the lower station and take the path of the pencil of light to be part of an arc of a circle. It wonkl therefore appear preferable in all cases to secure hy the best means at our command such values of the coefficient as will be most consisteut with or conform most nearly to the actual state of the atmosphere at iiie time. 111 case of reciprocal or double measures, simultaneous or not, we shall obtain two independent \·alues for the difference of heights, viz, h2-h 1 and h1 -h., the weighted mean of which results rua;r be taken for the final value Le. h. To introduce the results of the Mount Diablo and Martinez East observations, or of ,;;imilar observations at Hound Top and Jackson Butte, Cal., antl to accommodate Jordan's formul::e to practical computation applicable to the particular region under consideration, we proceed as follows: PuWng the minor terms with the factor 18400 occurring in the author's formula for the computation of heights from barometric measures, viz, 18400 ( 1 + . 377 ; ) (1 + . 002573 cos 2 <p) ( 1 + 2

At this station (Vaca) there were eight such objects observed as above. The next step is to compute the following quantities required in the reduction, viz: 1. The eccentric distances, between the vertical circle and the heliotrope at the distant station. This is effected with all needful accuracy by letting fall a perpendicular from the eccentric station occupied to the li11e centrally joining the two stations. The distance and azimuth of the eccentricity being known, as well as the azimuth of the line, the distance of this foot-point from the central station b is added or subtracted (as the case. may be) from the horiwntal distances between the stations, as given by triangulation. Thus, the distance s. from eccentric station A to heliotrope at B is not the same as s. between the eccentric station B and the heliotrope at A.
It will be found convenient to make use of the formula. log (s+ .6B)=log s+M.D..s, very nearly.

2. 'l'he observed zenith distances are re1lnced to the ground or station mark '"'',i.e., for height of vt>rtical circle above this point; and they are also reduced to the station mark at the d1M:rnt ,.;tation, i.e., for height of heliotrope above that mark. ~-1. By means of tables the mean values of the readings of the mercurial barometer are reduced to the freezing temperature, and the resulting height of the column is converted into millimeters; the mean temperature of the air is expressed in centigrade degrceH. The effect of diiforencti of moisture am] of variation of gravity at any two connected stations may be neglected in the present application. 4. To the above quantities is added the mean value of re taken from the table ~itl1 t11e argument time of da;r; thus, for the above example we haw the ten Yalnes 10' ET=224, 225, lSI, 1!16 190, 190, 190, 194, 194, 22i; meau, 201. For the stations east of Mount Diablo the second table for 107 n has been used, also for the Ross Mountain cmmection. The \·alnes of p are likewise talrnlated; argument, mean la ti tu de and azimuth.

. UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SUR"°EY.

'l'he above table contains sixty-two differences of height, three of which were previously given hy spirit leveling. For the difference in height between the termini of the base, the computad difference falls short of the spirit-level result by 1 m,l and the observed t;'s apparently prove the refraction along this line to have been negative, i. the ray of light was convex toward tbe earth's surface. TLis is due to the excessive heat of the ground· and the proximity of the ray thereto. In the lines from the lmse to Mount Diablo with zenith distances observed only at the base, we have differences of 6"'.1 and of om.3, the distances being 72 and 89 kilometers. No further notice will be takeu of the results by zenith distances of these three lines. ln the following adjustment h,y the method of least squares, the heights of the stations forming the conn1;¥Jtion of the hase with a primary line had to be treated by themselves, for the reason that this part of the work only is complete, whereas the stations to the eastward of the base will be ultimately con11ccted with the transcontinental line of spirit-levels at l\fouut Lola, at Hound Top, and at Jackson Butte, for which point:s our present results are only of temporary use; the long lines betwee11 188 and 229 kilometers will then disappear from the bypsometric work. In general, when there is a choice of selection of the process of adjustment between ''indirect ohsenations" and "conditioned observations," the former is generally preferable as offering greater facilities for the computation of probable errors of the result.

For the combination of these diflerences of heights we follow the principle of selectiug for the first station, that one whose height is most accurately determined from surrounding statiom; already known. The·accuracy depends on the number of separate determinat.ions, aH well as 011 the distances from the stations of known heights. The same principle is followed for the next station, and so on. Accordingly we have the following combinations :

PREFATORY NOTE.

In thi8 report on tlie principles adopted and the results obtaine1l in a second adjustment of the longitude system of the Coa:st and Geodetic Suney, As:sistaut Scl10tt has presentetl a comprehensive discussion of all meai'iures for longitude by the 1'lectric telegrnph hitherto obtained 011 the Surwy. He ha:s included in thi8 1liscu8sion tht> longittHle of Detroit, ::\Iich., the fmHlamental longitude station of the United States I,ake Survey, and has given in his table of results a ,·alue 1lerived for the lougitu1le of Ogden, Utah, this being the prineipal point of reference for the longitudes obtained in the United States Geographical Snr\'P,YS west of the one hundredth meridian. For the computation of the probable error of results, he has ginn the leading steps (formula: an(l numbers), since the treatment of the prouable enor of a functio11 of adjusted measures, involv ing conditional equations aud tlw use of correlates, has not hitl1erto lmeu shown in an.v application on the Survey. It will be seeu from the report that the resultt> of the American system of tdegraphic longitudes compare quite favorably in accnrac.r with t.hmm of the I<:nropean sy:stem, the averagt> prohable error of a longitude determination for the lattn system as deduced by Dr. Bruhm; i11 his recent discu8sion difl'eriug not greatly from the average probable error of a single determination as found Ly Mr. Schott.

COAS'I' AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Computing 1Jfoi11ion, NoVl"lnber '..m, 1884-. DEAR Sm: Since the publication, in 1880,* of the results of a first adjustment of telegraphic 1ougitude8 determined by the Coast and Geodetic SurYe;y, the progress made in this branch of geodesy has been con:siderable, not only iu the field work, but al8o in the office computatiorn<. Tltis may he seen at a glance by the following comparison of the state of the work at that time and at present: Total nmuber of difterences of lougitmle measured, in 1880, 127, at present lii8; of the former number.30 required a second or check computation, whereas the final values of all longitudes, to date, with tlie exceptiou of two for which further data are wanted, are now prl'sented. In the first adjustment of the s;rstem of longitudes there were 25 points between which 10 conditIOilS had to be satisfied, in the second adjustmeut the lllllllher of COlllJCCted principal points has increased to 33, aud the num her of condition8 hetween them to 21. The cliauge in the ratio of the number of points to the number of conditions indicates great increase in strength of the

system. Referring to the diagrams of the two reports, the westernmost station was New Orleans, La., in 1880; in the present papers it ii'i Omaha, Nebr., and it may be expeeted that in the next discussion the checkis will reach tlie Pacific coast. The appended diagram, plate No. :n, which is intended to show the connections only, has been made more definite b.Y the addition to each line of the year of determination. The geographical positions of all tlie longitude stations and their· connections are showu 011 the accompanying chart N o.19. As a matter of interest and for the right understanding of the earlier results of the survey, I have thought it desirable to repeat here a brief historical note taken from my first discussion. In the autumn of 1845 Superintendent A. D. Bache issued instructions to Sears C. Walker, Assistant, for the development of the method of determining geographical longitudes by means of tl1e elect.ro-magnetic telegraph. The first published notice by the Superintendent of the use of this method for geodetic pur-. poses is found in Uoast Surrny Re.port for 1846, on p. 32, and in its Appendix No. 11, p. 72. The first difference oflongitude, actually measured and comparing in accuracy with other astronomical methods then in use, was on October 10, 1846, between Washington and Philadelphia. The cooperation of the Superintendent of the United States Naval Obserrntor~- and of the director of the High School observatory having been secured, the Survey built short telegraphic lines connecting the respecti ,-e observatories with the telegraph offices of the two cities; the resulting dif. ference of longitude is given as ~o. 1 iu our general table. The 1ield and office work connected with the telegraphic longitudes of the Coast Sun·ey was under the special charge of Assistant Walker, by wl:om tqe method was speedily developed into one of great accuracy, and at once superseded the older methods in all cases where electric connection could be had. Assistant. '\Valker continued in charge for seven years to the close of 1852, when in consequence of his illness· Dr. Benjamin A. Gould was appointed Assistant bJ· the Superintendent in December, 1852, to take charge of the telegrapllic-longitude work; Dr. Gould con tinned i11 this dutytill 1867, when he resigued hie! position in tbe Survey. From 1867 to 1874, inclusive, Assistant G. W. Dean was principally in charge of tlie work under the immediate instructions of the Superintendent. After the year 1874 no special appointment was deemed necessary, as the method had long taken its place among other kuown geodetic operations. In September, 1878, however, Superintendent 0. P. Patterson directed tlie computations for telegraphic longitudes to be made in the Uomputing Division of the Office as a part of its regular duty, but still requiring a rough field computation from the observer. The revisions of computations and the new computations of longitudes indicated in my report of .June, 1880, haYe since been carried out, and the new determinations made after 1880 and up to the present time ha>e all been computed. Additional attention was paid to ~be relative weights of iudh·idual results at a station so far as they depend on the variability in the rate of the chronometer in the interYal between the transit epoch and that of the time of exchange of signals with tbe oppm;ite station, ~yet the eftect of small changes in weights on the final result is in most 1~ases inappreciable. '\'nth regard to field-practice, the superiority of results by the substitution of arbitrary break-signals in the place of automatic breaks for the exchange between stations h:is been fully recognized. During exchanges the chronograph is run at double speed, allowing Hie ncareHt hundredth of a second of time to be readily measured off. The modern use of quickacting electro-magnets and the equalization of the strength of the current contribute to greatl_y increased accuracy. As far as practicable, the same stars are obsen·ed at both stations.
EXl'LANA'l'ORY REMARKS TO THE FOLLOWING '.!.'ABLE OF RESULTS.

The westernmoi,it of the two stations is always given first, thus avoiding all ambiguity, all differences of longitude having the same sign. The reference-mark at fixt:>.d observatories is generally the center of dome or other reeoguized local meridian ; when t.he transit of the station is reforred to it is indicated hy Tr't. Two numbers in the column "No. of days of obsenation" iudicate the number of 1lays before and after the observers exchanged places; when but one number is given no exchange took place, and the differential personal equation was, in general, ascertained before or after the longitude determination proper.

(<~) The three determinations of Ogden observatory, the fundamental western longitude station of the United States Engllleers, though no included in tie opemtions of the Coast Survey, yet indirectly connected with It, are here given on account of the importance o! the po·ltlon of this observatory. It bolds the same place with respect to the United States Ellgineers' surveys as Detroit did wilh the United States l.alce SutTey. The probable ertors have been increased to allow for probable error of pel'llOllll.l equat!OJI. It wu connected with salt Lake City and Detroit in s873, and with Wuhiftgton In ·S,4. ·

(1:57) The Coast and Geodetic Survey tran!it instrument wa.s mounted in the meridian of the Dearborn observatory meridian circle.

The following Table II contains the observed values for the differences of longitude of all stations forming part of a connected system, and which is joined directly with that of Europe. Thus it contains only those 53 measures between which rigid geometrical conditions subsist, which it was the object of the present adjustment to satisfy; this was done by application of the method of least squares, a.nd Tahle II is arranged suitably for that purpose. Oolumn one gives the year of observation, column two the names of the western and eastern stations, and column three their observed difference of longitude directly taken from Table I. The fourt.h column contains the probable error of the measure a priori assigned; the fifth column gives the corresponding value of the reciprocal of the weight, and the last column contains the symbolical correction to the observed value. Let li be an observed difference of longitude where
i represents integers from 1 ro 53 inclusive; e; its probable error, and _!_ = l05e;2 the weight as p; used in the computation, the multiplier 105 being introduced for convenience; also let o; be the correction and x1 the mest probable value of the observed quantity, then l; 01 = x 1

The aNerage e2 equals .00142, hence the average probable error of the tabular quantities=± 0·.038 It may be stated that since 1878, when certain improvements were introduced, the average probable error of a determination 6 A, as deduced from 14 value8 (Yarying between the limits± o·.006 and 0·.025), equaled± o·.orn, which amount ma.) be regarded as a measure of the degree of accurac.Y attained by the SurYey of late years.

A comparison of the \'alues of the above table with the corresponding values reached in the first adjn&tment (of 1880) shows but very slight differences; before reacl1ing Washington the differences do not exceed 0·.001; for Washington the dift'erence is 0".002, and for New Orleans, the last station of the old adjustment, it rises only to ()A.012 We may, therefore, conclude that our eastern longitudes will not hereafter undergo any (practically) important change due to additions to our -system ; the only a.ppreciable change might come from additional transatlantic connections. The links via South America a.re many and tbefr probable errors nooessarily somewhat greater than for land lines, hence we do not anticipate any reaction from the closing of such extended circuits on our present longitude stations which stand in such direct connection with Gre~nwich.

In consequence of the somewhat laborious process of computing probable errors of functions of' a1ljnste11 values, and in tlle absence of' any special need to kuow the probable errors of all thP longitudes, I have here confined myself to those for two principal stations, 'Vashingtou and Cambridge.

Tile weights of these three determinations are practically equal, and we shall adopt the simple mean or A.= 711 27 111 59·.684±0·.07, the probable error being estimated. The value adopted b~· the United St&tes Engineers (see p. 55 of Vol. 11 of Lieut. G. M. Wheeler's Report upon United States Geograpl1ical Surveys, Washington, 1877) is 7h 27m ti9".{)43±0·.027* Hence all telegraphic lon~itudes depending on Ogden need an increase of 0".04
.JUNCTION OF THE A'MERICAN AND EUROPEAN SYS'l'EMS OP LONGITUDES.

The lines comwcting Greenwich, Paris and Brest are common to both, and in strictness these s.nitems should be adjttsted as one, but such a proceeding would involve an amount of labor altogether disproportionate to the gain, and another far less laborious process may be adopted with results equally satisfactory. Nor is either system at the present time complete. Our own is iucreasing in extent and complexity year by year; and with respect to the European system, it has beeu ispecially pointed out as desirable that the French determinations should be strengthened by «onuectiug those stations inter se which surround Paris (Proceedings Sixth Conference of the Iuternational Geodetic Association, 1880, .Appendix III, p. 32). If this suggestion be carried out it will briug Brest into more intimate connection with the l<Juropean s~·stem, and thus may slightly react upon our longitudes. In the Astrouomi:sche Nachriclit.eu, No. :313:3 (May, 1877), Dr. Albrecht published a preliminary adjustment of the telegraphic longitude-net of Central Europe. This discussion had for its special oqject to ascertaiu the degree of accuracy which bad then been reached in these measures. He submitted to treatment 2:.! determinations of difltn'ences of longitude, linked together by l l conditions. The weights allowed (by e.stimation) range from 1 to 5, and the average correction to any one measure, irrespecth·e of' sign, is 0·.041; two corrections exceed OS.l Greenwich is not included in this scheme. In No. 2265 (.Tune, 1879) he returns to the subject of adjustment of the longitud,es connected with the German 8ystem, his data in the mean time having increased to 39 determinations between 16 stations, ~·et his reimlts are stated to be still provisional. The weights assigned range from 1 to 6, according to the estimated value of the operation. The stations Greenwich and Paris are now included, and their 11ifl'erence 6 A.= 9m 20·.97 is given as <Jbserved; respecting this va.Jue see remarks further on in connection with Dr. Bruhns' adjustment of 1880, in which the ~ame slightly
· Thi11 probable error is too small, as it t-akes no account of the probable errors of the baee 11tatio11a, nor of the probable error due to the personal equations. The apparently better aooord of the Ogden-Salt Lake value, on p_, 56 of the Engineers' work, as compared with the ahove value (3), is dne to the circumstauee that a geodetic instead of an astronomical value for the longitndeofWashingt-00 ha.cl inadvertently been qaed; theva.lue 21' 19"' 22-,740 there given iUQUld have ~u ~ 19"' ~.Q731 acwrdiug t<> our present infurlli11tion,

1n the European system Greenwich and Paris are now directl,Y (or nt~arly di1·ectly) connected ,·ia Bonn, Bediu, Municli, Vie11ua and Brest, ancl wheu once satisfactorily a1~justed, it will probably he found advantageous for us to adopt the corrections demanded by it and readjust the American system with the condition of the longitudes of Brest and of Paris as .fixed. In the mean time no inconvenience can ari1:1e, though it shonhl be borne in miutl that in consequence of any tjiture cha.nge in the European system of longitudes, as just pointed out, our own longitudes may possibl.r be affected by a constant correction, and to an amount that may 1>ossibly reacll 0·.0:!;) In conclusion, I append the purely observat·ional results for the longitude of Cambridge arising from tbroo iadependent determinations. Since the earlier statements of 1874 were found to need some changes+ iu order to present the results entirely free of any adjustment, the observed values a.re taken from the general table of this report.

Hf'. is of the opiuion that accurate obsernttions of tlle currents and tides might possibly give a clew to these irregularities.

In order to be able to compare small areas of tlw stream, the rin~r i8 diYidPd into mile reaclies; tlte8e are denominated hy large letters on the illustrations, and begin at mile O, 14 rni!es from Fort l\liffli11; this mile gins an excess of excaYation oYer i;hoaling of 2,291j,282 cubic yanhl, which proliahly bas 1110Yed down-stream. The whole Yolnme of dPepening was 2,4!10,i2.; cnbie yard,;, and the shoaling-194,443 cubic yards, which g·i,·es the exce81> uoted aboYe. This t>xcess, if sprea1l out ewuly m'rr the 8H3 acres witl1in the mile limits, would girn au increase of drpth of 1.fil fret. It nm~, he noted that thf' conditions, within this mile, art> Yl'r:Y fayorahle to the mai11terntnc(· of the cli:mnel 1lt'pths, and that the fair-way occupies the width of the rirnr, witll an indication of the formation of Cherry Island shoal at its lower limit. The next mile, P, presents also an excess of deepening of 880,,WJ enbic yards, whicli occurretl chiefly in the deeper parts of the channel. On the shoal which uegins to show itself at. the uppt>r limit, the shoaling is clecideil, showing a maximum difference of 11 feet. '£his was the minimum depth fonnd 011 this shoal in 1841. In 1881, at tlie date of the ];1st surYey, we :fin<l hare spots at low water stage. Yet, notwithstanding this large accumuhition uu the shoalest part of the fiats, the irnlica.tioni; am that the aYerage depth-witbin mile P-has increased 0.5 toot. The 1111n-ement of material within this mile was 2,383,864 cuuic yards of exc~wation, and l/iO:-l,4():3 cnbie yar<h1 of o;hoaliug, from which the average increase of depth given aboYe is derived. Since the greater part of the material remo\'ed from mile 0 must haYe vassed dowu stream through P, and as P shows still an excess of deepening, we may find that thi8 matt·rial, l'e-inforce<l hy the amount from mile P, has in great measure lodged in the lower reacl1 at and above Deep Water Point. In tl1e next, mile Q, there has been an excPss of 8hoaling of 8J0,688 cuhic yards, loilged principally 011· the apex of Cherry Island Flats, and as a large \'Olume of material has beeu dredged 011 the west side of tl1e flats for a ship channel, this excess should he increased hy that amonnt in order to show the actual mcffement. The changes were l,i3 L-!72 cnhic yards of deepening and 2,ii82,1fi0 cnuie ;yard,:; of shoali11g, from which t'xcess of shoaling an :n-erage deerea,;e of 0.38 foot in the <lepth is obtained . .Mile R next below, gh·es an excess of deposit of 1,283,041 cubic ,Yards distributed fairl)' e\"e11I.v <ffer the area iuclosed, with the excPptiou of the vicinity of tlle mouth of Christiana Creek, wlwre a large accumulation ma.Y be traced.

The following mile, S, which is the last on the tracing, shows the largest. accumulation of deposit, amounting to 4,230,16!) cubic yards, or nearl.r 87 per cent. of the entire shoaling within the Ii miles. This depoF1it gives an a,·erage decrease of depth of 3.05 feet, which woul<l be alarming werl' it not that there is still a clear water-way with 44 to 48 feet in the channel at mean low water. '!'he changes uoted were 160,23() cubic yards of deepening, and 4,:)90,404 cubic yards of shoaling. If we now ohserrn the entire change within the 5 miles we find an excess of 3,187,215 cubic yards of shoaling; adding to this :mm l,G24,741 cubic yards" dredged by the United States Engi1wers on the Cherry Island R:111ge, and we find 4,811,!J55 cubie yards of material lodged witbin tl11; area represented 011 illui>tration ~o. 22, with, howeYer, the bulk of tlih; shoaling within mile S, in tl1e vicinity of Deep Water Jloint.

Dupont's Landing and the mouth of Christiana Oreek, was 23.(i feet, with a minimum depth of rn feet about on the site of the range-cut. In 1882, after the completiou of the dredged dianuel, the thalweg depth was 25.5 feet, with a minimum of 23.5 feet. The western channel also Rhows an improvement throughout. From a poiut opposite Ohl Man's Point to the deep water below the ftatR the thaitceg depth was '.!4 feet in 1ts41, with a minimum depth of 19 feet. In 1881 the average thal1cl'{} depth between the same poiut1' was 2r1.:1 feet, with a minimum depth of 20 feet. All depths given refer to meau low-water stage. The inference can be drawn from the above results of the comparison of depths in the vicinit,> of Cherr.v Island Plats, that of the two rival channels around the fiats the eastern channel woul!l have been the better one to have chosen for artificial improvement by drndging. This is strongly suggested hy the fact that without any aid outsitle of natural forees the eastern chmmel bas ainell in depth since 1841, notwithstanding the ad verse condition of opening a rival cltanuel Lly t"!re removal of I,500,000 cubic yards of material. The vicinity of the dredged cut also sllows cousiderable shoaling by the motion of the 18-foot curve to the edge of the cut. This closes the discussion of the results given graphically on illustration No. 22. These results are gi\'en in a condensed form in Table No. I which follows:

In the accompanying illustration, No. 23---0omprising the head of Delaware Bay-the comparison begins at cross-section 574, 32 miles from Fort Mifflin; this cross section crosses the southern point of Reedy Island and ends just above the mouth of Alloway's Creek. Tue first mile, marked H, ends nt cross-section No. 586 and contains 2,407 acres, within which we find au excess of shoaling of 2,236,227 cnhic ;ranls, which, if spread out, decreases the mean depth hy 0Ji7 fel~t. This shoaling may be due in part to the erosion of the shores, which have retreated inland :tloug uoth the New Jer8e;y and Delaware side, about 28.'l feet for the former and J2fi foet for the Delaware shore. Tbe mean width of the stream, for the 5 miles shown on illustration No. 2;1, has therefore increased 411 feet. The decrease of depth has obtained principally in the 1leep parts of the channel-way and along the Delaware shore. · Tbe south end of Reedy Island, included within the limits of this mile, shows a large decrease of superficial area since 1841, equal to 71 per cent. Should the loss coutiune at this rate, the south point, including the present site Of the light-house, Will ha\"e disappeared in the year HIOO. The loss of area for the whole island is, however, much below that given for the south point. Iu 1841 the island had au area of 152.2 acres; in 1882 tbe area was 116.1 acres, which show,.; a loss of 35~ acres or 23 per cent. At this rate the island would still be in existence 135 .veani. In a chart of the Delaware published in 1670, Reedr Island is shown and called l!izt l:slaud. The scale of the chart heing very small, no comparison of area can be made; but in a ,;nrvtw of Des Barres, rna<le in 1779, the island is called Reedy Islan<l, and has an area of 28~ acres. 'fhis area. seems large, and if not actually measured might be accounted for by the t,endency to exaggerate objects when sketching them. This is mentioned merely to show that the island has been wasting away sinee our knowledge of its existence. In the mile between sectioau~ 586 and 597, marked I, the shoaliug again exceeds lleepeuiug b:y 2,563,51.l cubic yards, which reduces the depth for this mile 0.56 foot. Four hundred and eigl.ttcen H.

acres show no change out of a rotal of 2,809.3 acres. The shoaling is again found mainly in the deepest part of the channel and occupies nearly the whole width between the 18-foot curves. The next mile, J, has an area of 2,638.9 acres, showing a still greater volume of shoaling than the preceding reach. The excess of shoaling is 4,418,311 cubic yards, which reduces the mean depth by 1.04 feet. An inspection of the illustration discloses that the shoaling extends nearly throughout the width of the bay, and that it is the heaviest in the channel where a maximum loss of 6 feet may be noted. The next area, mile K, between sections 608 and 619, begins to show a large decre.ase in the volume shoaled, although still in excess of the volume excavated. The area within this mile is 2,321.5 acres, over which the excess of shoaling of 923,226 cubic yards gives a decrease of mean depth of 0.25 foot. Only 96.6 acres give no change of depth. The accumulation appears to have been heavy on the west side of the ship channel, while the eastern half shows a decided deepeni~ which also obtains along the Jersey shore. Mile L, between sections 619 and 631, is the first which presents an excess of deepening over filling; this increase of depth has taken place largely in the channel, while the Delaware side shows a decrease of depth. The depths along the Jersey shore also show better water. The area within this mile is 2,360.5 acres, with an excess of deepening of 2,045,125 cubic yards, which gives a mean increase of depth of 0.54 foot. Two hundred and thirty-five acres gave no change of depth. A recapitulation of the changes exhibited in illustration No. 23, which represents 15 square nautical miles of the head of Delaware Bay, gives 23,044,616 cubic yards of shoaling, which if spread out ornr the area where shoaling has occurred gives an average decrease of 2.35 feet in the depth. H we compare the above aggregate amount of shoaling with the volume of 14,948,466 cubic yards excavated, we find an excess of filling of 8,096,150 cubic yards, which would give an average decrease of 0.4 foot in the depth for the five miles in comparison. The erosion of the shores, amounting ro 4,234,389 cubic yards, doubtless accounts for part of the above filling. This, however, still leaves a balance of 3,861,761 cubic yards of foreign material supplied from elsewhere; but as the reach above Reedy Island, as far as Fort Delaware, shows an excess of deepening over shoaling, we may infer that the supply has come from up-stream, and, as in this case, the volume of supply is greatly in excess of the amount found to have lodged within the limits under comparison, we may look for further deposits toward the capes of the Delaware. The following table No. 2. presents the changes exhibited graphically on illustration No. 23:

GEOLOGY OF THE SEA-BOTTOM IN THE APPROACHES TO NEW YORK BAY.·
By A. LINDENKOHL, COAST .AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

During the survey of the sea·approaches to New York in the years 184-2 and 1844, specimens of sea-bottom were collected while soundings were in progress. The samples were examined under the direction of Professor Bache by .Assistant L. F. Pourtales of the Coast Survey office, and by Prof. ,J, W. Bailey, of West Point, N. Y., and the results of the analyses were published as; .Appendix No. 11 to the Coast Survey Report for the year 1869. The investigations by these naturalists attracted attention and ended in opening the way to a field of scientific inquiry, which, at this time, is cultivated by men eminent in such researches in all the leading nations. Neither of the naturalists here named is now living. Within the last five years, minute hydrographic surveys have been made in the same locality. Some collateral information also has been furnished by the Geological Survey of New Jersey under the direction of Prof. George H. Cook. We are thus enabled to invest deductions with increased precision, and to extend inquiry beyond the limits to which .Assistant Pourtales restricted himself. Tile sea-bottom off the entrance to New York Lower Bay is characterized by features peculiar to that region. These include: (1) .A well defined submarine valley; (2) an area of clay bottom extending about one hundred miles seaward; (3) a deep ravine at the edge of the continental slope. The features here specified will be separately described. (See illustration No. 24.) Submarine valley.-The early survey of the sea-approaches to New York developed the existence of a series of "deep mud holes'' lying in a straight line oft' the entrance. These it was supposed might serve as guides to mariners, but no special significance was attached to the "mud holes" until Professor Dana, from a study of the Coast Survey soundings, showed that they lay in the course of a valley-like depression which had the right position to have been, in a period of higher level, the continuation of the Hudson River channel. When these views were communicated to the Coast Survey office, these mud holes were at once recognized as indications of such a channel, and it was surmised that they actually formed a continuous channel instead of being separated. The last survey has developed the existence of this channel; and thus the question is opened, whether this channel was produced by a break in the strat.a, as was the upper channel of the Hudson, or by the current of a river seeking an outlet to the ocean. The following facts bear upon the question : .The first indications of the channel are found ten nautical miles east by south off Sandy Hook, at a depth of nineteen fathoms. .After following a southerly course for a.bout ten miles, the channel takes an easterly turn in the next five miles: from the distance of fifteen miles (twenty miles in a direct line from the Hook) it maintains a straight course (600 t:)E.) to its bar, which is seventy-five miles from the Hook. From the head of the channel to the bend, the top of the banks remains at about an even level of eighteen fa.thorns depth, while the channel increases in depth from nineteen to thirty.six fathoms. The average slope of the banks is one degree, and. the width of the inclosed channel from threeand

quarters of a mile to a full mile. 1n the bend, this slope is increased to three degrees, and the width coutracte<1 to one eighth of a mile. The hanks maintain the '1>anw height on both sides, and are, as also is the bottom, composed of a sandy clay on·rlaitl hy a crust of sand and gran~l which spreads conti.nnously over tlrn adjacent tla.ts. Tlds clay is Yery uniformly de;;cribed by the surveyors as "blue cfay" iu the upper channel to tlte distance of forty miles from the Hook, and "green mud" in the lower diaunel. The bar (at seventy-five uautical miles from the Hook) is composed of fine saud. At the distance of eightyiiYe miles the channel reappears as a deep ravine and it will he described separately. The croRs section8 of the channel, at intervals of ten miles, starting from Sands Hook and taken from tbe recent sun'ey, are llere given.

From this exhibit we may iufer that the channel has been produced by erosion and that its present shape is due to the action of tlowing water. The mud brought up by the lead has not been deposited upon the sea-bottom hy precipitation, but is the actual soil, which is a stratum of clay which must have a thickness of over ninety feet. This Raudy cla~· is helieved to be identical with the Tertiary ''sandy clay strata" of the New ,Jerse.r Ueo1ogfoal Survey, which underlies nearly the whole of the peninsula of lower New Jersey. The diRappeara11cc of the submerged valley at a less depth than nineteen fathoms must be attributed to 1he obstructive action of Sandy Hook bar. Uy taking this depth as the greatest ever reached by the cliannPl over the bar near Sandy Hook we can form an estimate of the geological age of this har. Professor Cook, in a stateme11t made before the. Riparian Commission of New Jersey, Novemher 17, 1883, estimatei-1 the present rate of subsidence of the coast of New Jersey at about two feet iu a hundred yearR. ~u th is rate the decrease of depth from nineteen fathoms to four fathoms, which is about tlw present mean depth of the New York bar, would cover a period of 4,500 years. 'l'he transfer per 8altum of a. liar at the depth of forty· one fathoms and at a distance of seventyfiye miles from the Hook to one of nineteen fathoms depth, aml in the immediate vicinity, however, canuot well he explained upuu the theory of such a gradual and moderate subsidence as is believed to be going on at the present time. The State geologist, Professor Cook, assuming a mean dip of twenty-five feet to the mile for th<' marl heds, has indicated lines of strike upon his geological map, showing the depth below sea. level of the re<l sand bed (a subordinate 11tratum of the Cretaceous marl formation) and the lines A ~md B on ilh1Rtration No. 24 are such lines for the depths, respectively, of 250 foot and 1,040 feet. Tlleiw lines produced to the submerged channel strike the top of the clay bank at point..s the respe<ltirn depths of which are 108 and 162 feet below the ocean level. The great differeuce in dip (790 feet against 54 feet) may be accounted for by supposing that the top of the clay bank does not coincide with the line stratification (its slope being about two feet to

the mile), or there may be a flattening out of dip toward tlle sea. And, again, the sandy clay bed may not rest couformabl.Y on the formations which crop out on the 1.lry land. In the geological surveys of Pennsylvania and New ,Jersey the terminal moraine was accurately traced through tl1eRe two States, and the Rketeh shows its conrse from tlie valle.v of the .Alleghan;r in Vl7t>stern New York, eastward and southward to New York Bas. The line as there shown wastaken from a map b;y Professor Lewis in the .American Journal of 8cience., 1884, and from the geological map of New .Tersey, 1882. lt will be seen at a glance that this line and the !mhmerged valley of the Hudson form a continuous line, and this coiucidencl' sugge8t8 that this valles stands as a mark of the limit of the glacial drift and as one of the "great waste-weir8 of the melting glacier," to use an expression which Professor Lewis applies to the I.ehigh River. 'flw range of hills which tra\'erses Long Island from the New York Narrows to Moutauk Point has been recognized as a weH-deYeloped glacial moraine, and Professor Cook has established its lateral connection with the New Jersey moraine b;r way of the southern part of Staten Island. Now, if the contemporaneous existence of these two moraines could be proved, it would follow that tlie south end of Staten faland was the most advanced point of' the. glacier. Professor CLamberliu has very recently (in a contribution to the annual report of tbe United States Geological Survey, 1882-'83) made the relative ages of these two glaciers the subject of a careful study. For our present purposes it will suffice to state that the Long Island moraine, by reason of its great boldness, which implies a period of powerful glacial action, bears a greater resemhlance to the morP northel'lJ moraines of the interior than to the terminal moraine which stands ats the extreme advance of a gr3dually receding glacial drift. This circumstance alone warrants the assum1)tion that the terminal moraine must be looked for to the southward of Long Island. Cl(/,y bottom.-AssistantPourtales drew atteution to a large area of muddy bottom off the eastern end of Long Island, and remarked also upon the scarcjty of remains of animal life in the specimens of bottom from this region. That muddy bottom zone is interposed between the wide sand belt which skirts the coast and the deep-sea ooze which is of calcareous nature and which covel'8 all the deeper bottoms of the ocean. By careful study of the soundings, includiug those recorded by the United States .Fish Commission, we are enabled to trace the outline of this formation. It is triangular; the base DE (see illustration) coincides uearly with the Iiue of I,ooo fathoms a11d reaches from the latitude of Cape Charles to the longitude of Oape Sable. The apex (P) lies about ten miles southeast of Block Island, but a narrow strip of muddy bott-Om can be traced still farther north, nearly to the western end of Martha's Vineyard. Assistant Pourtalei; says (Coast Snrv<.'y Report for 1869, Appendix No. 11), "'l'he mud or ooze had its origin probably in the Tertiary formation of which we see only tlle remnants in the cliffs of' Gay Head, and in a few localities of small extent on the coast of Massachusetts, as at Marslifield or elsewhere. · · · A similar sea-bottom is found in the so-called mud boles (lfi' the entrance to New York. They are depressions below the general depth of the surrounding bottom, filled with mud." These expressions do not render it clear to me whether he consi<lered this mud to he sediment or true soil; but judging by the uniformity and the magnitude of its range, since the greater 11art if not the whole of the mud in question is either clay or corroded cla,y,· we recognize iu it the traces of a great geological formation having a vt-rtical range of nearls six thousand feer. The sea-bottom within this area ma;y contain the outcroppings of strata of various compositions and of different ages, but these strata must be assumed to be always more or less argillaceous. The shoaler soundings generally show a strong admixture of sand, while the deeper ones appear as purer clays. At about the depth of 1,000 fathoms the clay gives way to the globigerina ooze; but in some instances cla;y bas been found by the Fish Commission at depths ornr 1,500 fathoms. In view of the fact that in a coast region the distribution of "sand" and ''mud" bottoms is· very often the result of ocean currents, it appears proper to define the extent to which such currents may have affected the bruits of our "clay region." Vl-~e may freely admit that, in moderate
"'The fact that the specimens of sea-bottom brought up from this region, instead of being recogniz<'d as clay, nearly always have the character of a green sandy mud, may be accounted for, partly by the difficulty of penetrating hard clay and bringing up large quantities of matter with the sounding aµparatus in general use, aud partly by the supposition that in regionM where there are no strong currents, clay bottoms will always be found a.tfected Ly the aolvent power and chemical action of sea-water upon their components.

depths, currents may disturb and shift the material of the bottom and may also change its mineral composition hy the introduction of sediment washed out to sea, but such changes cannot take place at great depths nor at great distances from the coast and could have affected but a very limited part of the clay bottoms. The only agency which could change the geological structure of the seabottom at the depth of the main part of the clay region, we take to be precipitation of very fine material held in suspension by the sea-water; but the effect of such precipitation would be to obliterate existing geological distinctions rather than to render them more apparent. A line drawn from 'l'renton to Jersey City separates the clay region from the red sandstone region. This line is about one hundred and fifty miles from the curve of one thousand fathoms. Bence if we assume these two lines t-0 be on one plane of stratification, the dip of the strata would be forty feet to the mile. It appears quite plausible to assume that the dip of pliable strata which is found to be decreasing in the coast region should show an 3ccelerated increase when it approaches the continental slope. It has been suggested by Professor Dana, and is so stated in Dana's .Manual of Geology, 2d edition, p. 537, that the lower limit of the ~ew England part of the terminal moraine probably coincided with the outline of the deep-water slope, about 80 miles south of Long Island and outside of Saint George's Shoal. Now, the clay bottom region being bare of drift, we can safely assume that the lines F D and F E indicate the extreme limit of glacial drift on this part of the (\Ontineut. The thickness of tl1e cover of diluvial drift in the vicinity of tbe submerged valley a1)pears to be at the utmost about 60 feet. Tlte Hudson Rirer fiord.-The deep ravine mentioned above as one of the remarkable foatures of the sea·a}Jproaches to New York lies in a nearly straight continuation of the submarine channel, and reaches from the outer end of the bar already mentioned, or about 85 miles to seaward from Sandy Hook, to the edge of the continental slope, at a distance of about 105 miles from the Hook. This ravine is about 25 nautical miles long and 3 miles wide. It commences with a depth of about 60 fathoms below the ocean's surface, which increases to 200 fathoms within the :first mile; the greatest depth, 474 fathoms, is close to its outlet. This outlet to the ocean is in the shape of a bar, with a depth of about 200 fathoms. .For half its length, from its middle to the ba1·, thii; raviue maintains a vertical depth of more than 2,000 feet, measuring from the top of iti> banks; tllese banks have a nearly uniform slope of about 140. It remains to be stated that tlie bottom a11d the sides of the raviue are compo3ed of a green sandy mud, and the adjacent flats, unlike those of the 1mbmerged channel, show the same material. The absence of signs of violent action in the region of this depression preclurles the supposition that it is a fissure; ou the contrary, its position at the lower limit of the glacier, its shape and its direction, render probable the supposition that it belongs to the class of :fiords so common to higher latitudes. If we so conclude, the question cannot be avoided-why is the continuity of the submerged channel interrupted by a bar Y The borings at Cape May, Atlantic City, and elsewhere along the New Jerse~· sea-border, carried down to depths of 200 feet or more, do not show auy harder i>trata than cla~-. Hence there is no reason to assume that this bar was induced by a rocky obstruction. 1t appears more plausible to suppose that the fiord belongs to an earlier time when the 1·iver made its channel t-0 the sea through ice obstructions, and that the submerged channel farther up is of a later period, when the passage to the ocean waB free~ and the regime of the river was well established.

DETERMINATIONS OF GRAVITY WITH THE KATER PENDULUMS AT AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND; SYDNEY, NI<:W SOUTH WALES; SINGAPORE, BRITISH INDIA; TOKIO, JAPAN; SAN l'RANCISCO, CAL. ; AND WASHINGTON, D. C.
By ED~IN SMITH. Assistant.

1884. DEAR SIR: I have the h.onor to submit the following report of the pendulum work executed by the 1iarty under my charge, in conformit.y with your instructions of Hepternber 8, 1882 . .A party going to Auckland, New Zealand, to ouserve tbe trausit of Veuus iu Decemlx>r, 1882, an opportunity was afforded to make valuable pendulum obserrntions at that place and other points at a comparath·ely i;mall additional expenditure of mone~·. During 1881-'82, 3:1ajor Herschel, R. E., swung the three invariable Kater pendulums, Nos. 4, 6 (1821 ), and 11, at Kew, Greenwich, and Laugham, England, and at ~Washington and Hoboken. United States, in order to form a connectiou between the English and American p1·mlulmn work, Ou completion of these obsern1tiomi the pendulums were loaued to the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. Nos. 4 and 6 (1821) are the pendulums used iu the Great Trigonometrical Sun·eJ' of India, and all three have most important places in the pendulum observations of the present century. It seemed to J·ou in e\·ery way most desirable to use these pendulums on the proposed expedition, and thus add important data to that already existing, and strengthen the connection between American pendulum work and that executed in other countries. Having been appointed ~ the charge of the United States Transit of Venus party to New Zealand, these pendulums were turned over to me by Prof. C. S. Peirce, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, in whose care they had beeu since Ma:jor Herschel's departure. Prof. H. S. Pritchett, of the 'Vashingtou University, of Saint J,ouis, was appoiuted A8;;istant Astronomer, and Augustus Story, of Boston, and Gustave Theilkuhl, of ·washington~ as photographers in the Transit of Venus party. We sailed from San Francisco on September 24, 1882, and arrived at Auckland, New Zealand, October 15. After the Transit of Venus and pendulum work at this station was completed, the two photographers returned to the United States. .Accompanied by Prof. H. S. Pritchett as Act· ing Assistant in the <Joast and Geodetic Survey, I visited the following places at which the peudu· lurns were swung, viz: Sydney, New South Wales, in January, 1883; Singapore, Straits Settle· mentR, British India, in March; Tokio, Japan, in .April and May; San Francisco, Cal., in June. It was intended, also, to swing these pendulums at Batavia, Java, and at Hong-Kong, China, but these stations bad to be given up from want of both time and funds. The pendulums were finally again swung in Washington, during March and April, 1884, where I was assisted by ~Ir. H. :Farquhar, of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, who had assisted Major Herschel in his observations at Washington and Hoboken in 1882.

A quantity of moisture ha Ying accumulated in the glass tulw, a new one was obtained from Green, of Kew York, and nsed at Auckland, Sydney, aud Singapore. At Tokio it was found broken, and the old tube was broken while trying to driYe the moisture and air out. At Tokio alHl San Francisco obserYatiom; were made at full pressure of the atmos11here, the Green cistern barometer beiag used. A new siphon tube was obtained from Grl:'en for the \'\'ashington observations. A cletailec.l description of these pendulums and apparatus is given iu Vol. V of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, and it is thought unnecessary to repeat it here.
ME1'HOD OF OBSERVATION.

The work with these pendulums being pnre]J c.liffereutial, and intended for comparison with the obserYations matle by Ma;jor Herschel, hii> methods were adopted as nearly as practicable. Tile pressure in the vacuum chamlJer was kept such that the density would be nearly that of air at ;):!O F. uwler a pressure of 26 inclies. The pernlult1m was started "'ith au arc of ahout 75' (1.1 inches), a11fl swuug for about six lwurs, wh1·11 the arc was about 8' ( .12 inch). A coincidence, the arc, temperature, aml pressure were ohserrnd at the beginning aud eud of the set, aud also an occasional intermediate coincidence. Four such sets were observed in the position called l\l (marked face towards obser\'er), a11d four set,.; in position called I' (marked face from obserYer). Thus eaeli vendulum was swuug rortyei~ht 11ours, tweuts-four iu each po8ition. The observations with the three pendulums at each stati011, exePpt \Vashington, were completed in 144 to 168 cousecutive hours. At vVashingtou douhle the number of ohservatiom; were made. Iu ohsl:'niug coincidtmces. the disappearance and· re-appcaranee of the Herschel dots were uoted on ouly one si<le of the tail-piece of the pendulum-always the apparent right. The obsen,er callecl "ti11,:' and the time was uoted and recorded by an assistant standing by the clock. At 'Vashington we had no recorder, and as the face of the clock conld not he seen b~· the observer, the time of coincideuce was uott~d with mean·time chronometer, Bond & Sons, No. 196, and from the comparisons of time-pieces the R. S. Clock times of coincidences were deduced. The coincidencei,; were obsened lJy Prof. H. S. Pritehett or myself at all the stations etcept \Vashingtou, where l\lr. H. Farquhar, of the Ooast. and Geodetic Surve.v, took part in the observa. tions in place of Professor Pritchett.
·In the inventory reccivc<l from Major Herschel with this apparatus, it stated that the number on the plate at back which carries the supports of the pendulum iij 1. When this clock was unpacked at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, in January, 1"84, the case Wilt! so much damaged that a new one was made, and it was then disoovexed that the number is %.-E. S.

The time observations at Auckland and Singapore were made with meridian telescope No. 13, arnl at Tokio with the transit of tlic 'fokio Observatory, by l'rotessor Pritchett. At Singapore no chro11ogmph was used. At Sau Praucisco the first two uight's observations were made by Professor Pritchett, and the rcmainiug nights by myself. At Washington the rate of the R. S. Clock WH8 d!'tcrmined from sig11al8 received from the Naval Observatory. In reducing the time oh8c>n-atio11s. tlH· times of transit over the mean of the wires were correctell for a herration, rate, and leYel.

'l'HERMOME'l'ERS.

I was furnishcil with two Baudin thermometers that had been compan·d and examined by Prof: C. S. Peirce, and it was intcudecl that frequent comparisons should be made between them and No8. 714 and 715. At Auckland and S;rdney there was no opportunity, and at Batavia they were accidentally carried off to E11gland with my trunk, in which they had been placed for safety. The_y were finally obtained without injury ou my return to the United States. On completion of the observations at \Vashiugton iu April, 1884, all the thermometers were turnerl over to Prof. C. S. Peirce for comparison, and I here gi rn his letter addressed to you concerning them:

I suppose that in these observations 715 was right sidt~ llp. (It is used njlside dowu.) Owing to the peculiar manner of determining the tixe<l points at Kew, tlle corrections obtained there will lie more uegatirn tllau those 1 should get. The.r will take a calibrated thermometer, aud iirst keep it iu ice fo1· l.wnrs, 11util tlie glasR liai,; considerably contrar·ted and the merenrs has risen, and will then 11rnrk the freezing point. 'fbt'y will then rai.se it to the boiling point and mark the hoili11g poiut. Suppose, then, sneh a tht·rmometer shows 200 C., without correction aecording to tlw111. l iil1onhl take thi;, tb.ermometPr a111l place it in ice for abont 100 seconds, and obserYe the freeziug point. It wonld mark a lower point than zero, and would have a positive correctio11, accorcliug to nw. The discrepancy would be a little less owiug to my 100° occupying a long1;r range ou the stem but still there would l>e a di:ffereuce at ordinary tempern.tnre.-; of o0 .'..l or 00.3 .P. The infereuee is, therefore~ that these thermometers have not changed since tlw Kew determinations, especiall_y as the negative correction ought, with time, to increase instead of diminishing· .. Therefore, since the absolute temperature is 11ot desired, but the difforence from Ifori<chel's temperatures, the Kew corrections should be adhered to in reducing Mr. Smith's work."

SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES.
It was intended to swing the pendulums at Fort Macquarie, where Freycinct and Duperry had swung pendulums in 1819-'22-'25, but it was found impracticable to do so. The magazin~ wa,i, the only place at the fort suitable for pendulum work, and was not large enough to admit tbe Kater apparatus. Mr. H. C. Rm'lsell >ery kindly offered theJacHities of the Sydney Ubservat;ory, of which he is the Director. The pendulums w~re hung in the cellar under the transit room. The fl.oor and walls are concrete<l. The foundation is very solid and the temperature very constant. It would be difficult to find a more suitable place for pendulum observations-as the results 8how. The apparatm1 was set upon the floor, and the clock attached to the west wall. The posit.ion of this station as given in the volume of Sydney Observations, 1877-'78, is: Latitude, 33° 51' 41".1 S.; longitude, lOh 04m r~·.81 E. ; height, 140 feet. After the apparatus was set up at this station the work was conducted entirely by Professor Pritchett, my eyes being still in such a condition that I couJd make no observations. Our sincere thanks are due to Mr. Russell for his many attentions and personal assistauoo in the pendulum work.

SINGAPORE, STRAITS SETTLEMENTS. At Singapore the pendulums were swung in the laboratory of the New European Hospital. This is a large, rnasRive building 011 a slight rise of grouud to the west of the town. The laboratory on the ground tloor was at this season protected from the sun, and has a solid, tiled floor. It was very well suited for pendulum work. The apparatus was set upon the tloor, and the clock was attached to a lmam Oil the north wall. The laboratory is cJ,765 fet>t sooth and 3,870 feet west of the flag-staft' at. Fort Carming. The position of this flag·stufl:' is girnn bJ· the United Sta.tes Hydrographic Office as: Lat., io 17' 33 11 .7 N.; long., (jh 55"' 23·.5 W.; from which we find the position of the laboratory to be: Lat., 1 o 161 46 11 N.; long., Gh 55m 21" E. The height of floor is 45 foot. The transit pier was built of brick near the northwest corner of the building. Permission to occupy this building was granted by his excellency Governor Weld. Pr. Simon, the resident physician, gave us quarters, and every facility of the institution, and to Captain McCallum, R. E., in charge of the office of colonial engineers, we are indebted for very important assistance.

UNlTED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY. TOKIO, JAPAN.

On arrival at 'I'okio a11 i1ivit:ition was recefred from Mr. Koto, the president of the Imperial Uninll'sity of Tokio, to swiug the pemltilums at the nuiversity where Professor Mendenhall had made sueh obserrntions iu 18:-10. The Kater apparatus could not be set up in the physical labora. tory where 11endenhall had made his observations, and :so a new "go-down" (mud fire-proof building) was phice1l at our disposal. The ground at the university is low and wet, and d@es not afford a good foundation, hut after several days were spent in examining various localities, it was concludetl that the uufrersity would be the best point. By Mr. Koto'ti direction a portion of the floor of the "go-down" was taken up, and piles dri\·eu nry closely together, upon which was built a solid stone pier, 7 feet square and 5 feet deep. Upon tliiis pier the apparatns was monnterl. The clock was attached to the wall. '.l'he Tokio Observatory is uearly 2 miles distant from the university, but is conuected with it. by telegrapl1. By the kintluess of H . .M. Paul, professor of astronomy, the time observations were mitde at the obsen·ator~·, and r<'corded on the chro11ograph at the uui\·ersity. The position of the obserYatory tr:msit, as furnished by ProfeR.sor Panl, is, latitude 35° 42' 40 11 N., longitude 9 11 19"' 04· E. The p1mitio11 of the pendulum pier is not so well known, but is gh'ell as latitude 350 42' N., lougitmle H" 19"' 0. · E.; height, 20 feet. On April 23 the apparatus was set np and rcatly to begin observations. About 10 p. m. quite a severe earth·1nake took place, which fortunately tlid 110 harm. The seismographs gave no iudi· cation of any otlier earthqn:lkes till Ma_y 2, the day after the observations were completed. Mr. Koto assigned to our aid three of the assistants of the university, who bad taken part in Professor Mendenhall's observations, Messrs. Tmoka, Yamada, and Ono. One or other of these gentlemen was always present acting as interpreter, recortler, &c. We were also given quarters aud servm1ts in the maiu buildi11g, 1lnri11g our i;tay in Tokio, by the authorities of the university, au<l to ttem we are much indebted for attentio11 at1d assistance, without which our work would l1iwe been difficult.

SAN FRANCISCO, CAL. At San Francisco the pend11lum station was selected by Prof. George Davidson, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey. This station is located in the middle of Octavia street (not yet an open street), just north of Clay street. A space is inclosed by a high board fence, within which were three wooden buildings, none of which could be used for pendulum observations. Another wooden building, 10 by 20 feet, and divided into two rooms, was therefore erected. The north room was lined with heavy wrapping paper. In this room the pendulum apparatus was mounted upon a brick pier. During the pendulum observations the whole building was eovered with canvas. This was the best that could be done under the circumstances, and it proved very unsatisfactory, the fluctuations of temperc\ture being too great. Soon after the observations were begun Professor Pritchett was detached from the party, and I was assisted by E. F. Dickins, Assistant Ooast and Geodetic Survey, who volunteered bis services. The geographical position of the station is latitude 370 47' 22' 1 N., longitude Sii oom 42".7 W.; hei;ht, 375 feet.

WASHINGTON, D. C., 1884.
On my return to ·washington in July, 1883, I fournl the entire east wing of the Smithsonian Institution was being rebuilt, and it was not till .March, 1884, that the pendulum room was placed at our disposal. 'fbe room is the same in which Major Her1wbel made bis observations iu 1882, hut iR 110w much better adapted to pendulum work-being less damp, and divided into two rooms ~o that the apparatus may be in one and the obserncir in the other observing through a small hole tn the interveniug door. 111 Major Herschel's observations the H.. S. clock was attached to the north wall, while in this work it was attached to the south wall. This ch1111ge was neces~ary on account of the division of the room and the arrangement of certain steam-pipes in the 11ortb wall. Signals were received from tlw Na Ya! Observatory for ten minutes, beginning at Oh 22m aud 1211 22m Washington mean 1i nw, 1he \Ya shin gton standard clock being used. These signals were recorded on the chronograph with sidereal clnonometer, Frods. No. 3477. Immediately before or after these signals the chrouometer wm; «om pared b,v coincidence of beatt:l with the R. 8. clock, and mean-time chronometers, Negus, No. 15'i2, and Bond & Sons, No. 196. Corrections to the Washington clock, corresponding to Oh 26"' and 1211 26"', were furnished by the observatory. They all depend upon observations of trausits of stars made near these times except on April 9, indicated by brackets in the table. The geograpltical position of this station is, latitude 3go 53' 19".6, longitude 511 osm 04·.4; height, mt9 feet.

On examining these results it is fouml that at Tokio the vibration number of pendulum .No. 4 is between three and four vibrations too great, and will have to be rejected. I can only explain this discrepancy by the supposition that some foreign material was adhering to the pendulum during these observations. Great care was always taken in wiping the pendulums before suspending them. The vibration numbers in column 7 Oil page 58 may be readily re(luced to any temperature aml density of air and corrected for elevation of station, for comparison with other results. This is not done here, as it is deemed advisable, at present! to publish this work simply as so many additional data to those already obtainml with the Kater pendulums, and to make no inference from them till similar data of Major Herschel's work in England and the U nitcd States have been received. I have the honor to be, ver~· respectfully, yours,

APPENDIX

No. 15.

ON THE USE OF THE NODDY FOR M};ASPRING THE AMPLITCDE OF RWA YING IX A PEXDn.rM
SUPPORT.

The" Noddy" is au instrument invented by Thomas Hanly, a well-known English clockmaker of the early part of this century. It was employed hy him aml ot!Jers to detect a11y oscillatory swaying of a pendulum support, but I use it to measure th\' amplitude of sucl1 swaying. It co11sists of a little pendulum supported, like an ordinary cloek pendnlnm, from a reed or spring; hut inRtead of hanging down it stands erect, Ro that gravit,v act.fl against the spring and canRes the pendulum, although quite short, to oscillate with the same natural period ai:; the gra,-ity pendulum, wl1ich hangs from and swa,vs the support. The instmmm1t. that was constructed after my deRign by the late l\:[. Breg·uet is firmly attached to a brass lwd-plate, resting on three .screw-feet.. 'l'l1P reed is 1 centimeter in Jeng·th, and from it 8priugs the staff of the noddy, consisting of a steel wire 1 millimeter in lliameter autl abont !) centimeters long;. From t.lie lower part of the staff, just auove the attaelunent of the. reed, two short wires extend at right angles to the iixis of the staff aud in the plane of the oscillation; they lrnYe screw-t,hreads cut upon them, and citrry short brass <·.;dinders through the axes of which tl1f·y pass, and which make the priucipa.l weight of tbe noddy. They can be scre\ved along the wires so as to adjust the equilibrium and alter the radius of gyration about an axis through the center of mass. Another weight, spherieal iu form, slides upon the staff of the noddy, and senes to adjust"the height of the center of mass. There are several setR of cylindrical weights and several sliding weights. At the top of tbe staff is fixed a small oblong frame carr.yiug a glass scale of hmths of millimete1·s, the lines being vertical and the scale running in the direction of the oscillatory motion. The scale is 10 centimeters from the attachment of the, staff to the reed. A pillar attached to the bed-plate, with its axis in the Yertical plane of the reed, carries a horizonta.I microscope. directed toward the scale. on the noddy, which is illuminated from an adjustable reflector behind. The microscope is focnsed with a ratchet; it is furnished with a draw-tube, and carries in tl1e focus of the eye-piece a horizontal scale or glass, t'Hch division of which is equivalent to about O"'m.03 in the focns of the objective as ordinarily used. The noddy is protected from currents of air by beiug iuclosed in a tight metallic cylinder, furnished with two plate-glass windows opposite to oue another at the level of the micrometer scale. This cylinder carries the reflector. It h; also furnished with a stop·cock, so that the air can he exhausted if desired. The upper ends of the screws of the screw-feet are point.NI like the lower ends, so as to serve as feet; and there is a wooden stand with rests for these feet, upon which the whole apparatus can be place(l upside down to permit the ohserqit.ion of tlw period of oscillation of the pendent noddy. We may first consider the case of the free oscillation of the noddy, and for the 1weRent we may neglect all resistance to its motion. Let us assume a system of rectangular co-ordinates having its origin at the root or fixed attachment of tlie reed, the axis of y being directed Yertically upwards and that of x being in the plane of oscillation. The axis of z is then para.He! to the axis of rotatiou, but tbe motion will ~ assumed to be in the plane of xy. Iiet a be tbe distance of any particle of

It thus appears that the figure of the reed is a curve of sine8, or a part of such a curve, the wavelength being 2 :_.

This equation shows that the noddy would oscillate with a period, a sort of mean between its natural period and that of the gravity pendulum.

.A.t the beginning the noddy would be a quarter of a phase behind the gravity pendulum; at the maxiruum mmillation of the noddy it woul<l be in opposition to the pendulum; and when it was re'luced to re~'lt again it would be a quadrant in advance. It would then start up as before. In considering the influence of the gravity pendulum upon the noddy, however, it is essential to take account of the resistance to the motion of the latter, owing to the internal friction of the spring and to the viscosity of the air. The dissipation produced by the former cause will be

This will add the term

It will slightly change the figure of the spring, and the equation to determiue this will be a partial differential equation, showing that the wave-length will not be constant. But this effect will be ·cry small aud may be neglected. Neglecting also the effect of the resistance upon the period of the motion, we find that if the natural motion of the noddy is

I have made considerable use of the instrument, and find it gives results agreeing within a few per cent., and that it is on the whole a tolerably satisfactory way of determining the amount of swa,ying of a pendulum support.

lly C. S. PEIRCE, As"i>"tant_

In determining the accelerat.ion of gravity, it is necessar.r to consider the effect of the tlexure of the pendulum during its oscillation. Suppose, first, that a peudulum, otherwise rigid, has an elastic joint parallel to the knife-edge and at a distance r vertically below it in the position of repose. liet m11 be the mass of the piece of the pendulum connected with the knife, m that of the piece jointed to it; '1 0 the distance of the cen· ter of mass of the first piece below the knife-edge in the position of repose, It that of tlle st·coud piece below the joint; Yr and r the radii of g,rration of the two pieces about axes through their centers of mass 11arallel to the knifo-edge; & 0 and 11= & 0+ ot! the angular di:-;placenwnts of the t\\'O pit>ccR about their centers from the position of repose of the whole pemlulum. J,et Ebe the coeflicieat of elasticity of the joint. With this notation, the kinetic potency* is written
F=gm0 h0 (1-cos fJ 0 )+gmr (1-cos fJ0 )+gmh (1-cos
fl)+~s

(M1) 2

If the differential equations were formed, were made linear by the omission of terms of liig-lrnr degrees, and were then resolYed, the motiou would he seen to consist of two harmonic components, the amplitudes of which are arhitrary constants. It is, therefore, pos~dhle for one of these to vanisll, and we may assume such an equation between fJ and 1:10 as to bring aboat this result. 'l'his equation must express the condition that the kinetic potency shall be a minimum. It is, therefore,

or

The elasticity of the joint might be measured by holding the first piece of the pendulum firmly in the horizontal position, while the second piece stood out straight, and measuring the angular tlexure at the joint. Denoting this by the last equation gives

·The termpotmitial energy grates upon the ear of a student of Aristotelian philosophy, because bot~ words dcriYe their whole standing in language from that philosophy, and in their proper meanings are directly contradictory of one another. "Energy" means actuality, and "potential" means not yet actualized, RO that potential energy iR uuactual actna.lity. The conception of half the vis viva as an actuality or energy of which the negative of the potential is the corresponding potency or power, seems preferable to the contrary conception that the latter is the real "work" "r performa.noo, and the former merely the "power" or vu which develops it; because the negativi; of the potential may subsist for any length of time, but always tends to produce vis viva, while the vis viva must increase or tliminish and does not particularly tend to do either rather than the other. I shall, therefore, venture to call f:Smv· the kinetic act or kinetic energy a.nd the negative of the potential, the kinetic power or kinetic potcncr. For the sum of the two I olQl think of no better term than mol\1'ity or ki-'8. 41!3

If there are a number of stiff joints, the sum of their separate effects gives their combined effect. It appears, therefore, that the effect of the flexure of a pendulum upon its period of oscillation is virtually to lengthen it by a quantity which is generally of the same order of magnitude as the amount by which one extremity of the pendulum would sag if the other end were held rigidly horizontal. This must be quite a considerable quantity for all the reversible pendulums which have ever been constructed.

BRIEF ACCOCNT OF THE EXHIBIT l\IADE BY THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY AT THE SOlITHERN EXPOSITION, LOUISVILU~. KY.
By H. -W-. BLAIR, AssiHta.nt.

PREl"ATOH.Y NOTE.

A bo11t tbe middle of July, 1883, Assistant H. W. Blair was inRtructed to prepare, under the dL n·c1iou of th<~ A,:-ist.mt in cl1arge of the Ofilee, a <'ollectio11 of im;trnrnPntt' mid apparatus that should fairly illul"<tr<1tP tile ,.;f'H'nd br.mches of fi<~ld-work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and the wetl10ds of work iu tht Office of Weights and Measures. This collection, together with a set of the pnhlicatious of the Smvey, he was directed to arrange for Exhibition at the Southern Exposition, held in Lonis\ille in tbe smnmer and mltnmn of 188,). Mr. Blair stl;ltes that the Exposition, as a wb.ole, was illustrative principally of the manufacturing aml agricultural interests of the couutry, hut that there mauy were fine commercial exhibits and displa;ys of art work, and that 1he displaj·s of a scientific character were confiued mainly to the applicatious of electricity as a light-producing and as a motive power, and to the exhibits made by the United States Government, in which, besides the Coast and Geodetic Survey, eight other Government bureaus wen· represented. The o'hjt:ct which attracted most attention in the Coast and Geodetic Survey exhibit, Mr. Blair observes, was the model of the G n lf of l\f exico. Senral applications for copies of it were received and many special visits were made to it bj· classes of advanced students, principals of schools, and others intereHted in geographical and geological studies. Reference is made to this model in Mr. Blair's account of the exhibit of the Sur·ny, nnd a full deRcriptiou of it, aR since enlarged and extended to inclu(le the Bay of North America will be found in Appendix No. ·17. At the close of the Exposition two awards were made to the Coast and Geodetic Survey; one of these was a medal for its exhibit as a whole, and the other a diploma for the Line and End Comparator. For courtesies extended by the manager of the Exposition, Maj. J.M. Wright, and by other officials, and for the a:ssistance rendered and kindness sbown by Prof. J. R. Procter, State Geologist of Kcutuck.y, who had general charge of the placing of the Gonrnment exhibits, Mr. Blair expresses his high ltJlpreciation.

'rl1ii-; devartmcnt of thP work is represented by two theodoliteti, such as are mmd in primary and secondary triangulation, and by two \arieties of heliotropes. 'l'he larger of the two theodnlites has a <~ircle of 16 inclles diameter awl the limb is divided to 5' of arc. By three filar micro111t't11r microscopes situated at equal angular intervals of 120°, the circle is read to single seconds, and with the meth0tl of observing pursued, the average probable error of a final rnea11 directio11 measured with i11Rtrn11w11ts of this class is less than 0".2. In this instrument the circle, spindlP, a1id all working partii ar1' made of il'ou, greatly reducing the trouble experienced from unequal expansion in the exposm·p to which the instrument is unavohlably sub. jecteu in field use, and which is a serious source of annoyance and error when the theodolite iR made pm;tly of irou and partly of braf'ls, or entirel.Y of brass, which has a much higher co-efficient of expansion than iron. The telescope i" supported on the improved Fauth & Co. horned Vs, cast in one piece, gi\'iug far greatPr stability than when supported on two pillars. It also bas the impro,·ed clamp deYised by G. N. Saegmullcr, chief mechanician of the Sur,ey. The telescop11 ha8 an aperture of 3 inches, a focal length of 34 inches, and the magnifying power orrlinarily m;ed is about HO diameters. Atl<litional eye-pieces, furnished with the instrument, give other powers greater and less than this. \Vith a theodolite similar to this, aml with a telescope equal in size and power, observations were made in California between two points 192 miles distant. This is the longest line ever observe<l in geodetic work. The Hrnaller theodolitP has an S-inch t·irr·li· d iYi<le<l to 10', and reach· to single seconds h~- two filar 111iero111l'll'r 111i1'.ros1·opt·s J,>;(P ap;trt.

The probaole error of an observed direction is generally between 0".3 and 0" .4. Both theodolites are provided with delicate striding levels and with illuminating lamps for night work. Heliotropes are used for ohserYing upon stations at which, from distance, smoke, or haze, an ordinary signal pole would be invisible. In their usual form they consist of a mirror or system of mirrors so mounted that when the iustrmnent is directed towards a dil'ltant i-;tation the sun'" fit,ys are reflected by the mirror to that point, a.nd the ob!'lmTet' there makes his poi11tiugs upon the reflected point of light, as upon an ordiuar;v signal pole. Heliotropes were used with perfect success on the long line aho,·e mentioned, and upon several others exceeding 150 miles in length. lJ.

'l'he thPodolite iR the larger one above described, and the method usuall_y followed in observing for azimuth iH to measure the angle between a terrestrial ol~ject and a eircumpolar star near eastern or westem elongation. The zenith t!:'lei,;cope iH used exclusively for tl.Je determination oflatitude by the Talcott method, which c011sists in ohsening 1>tars. iu pairs, the stars being 011 opposite sides of the zenith and at so nearly the same zenith distauce that the <l~fferenee of their zenith distances may he measured by a micromet.ert>;Ye-piece. The uncertainty of absolute measures of zenith distance is thm1 ob\·iated, and the quantities to be measured heiug small, mid the value of the mierometer being capable of the most accurate determination, thl' rPsulting enor of measurement is a minimum. Also the uncertainty of atmospheric refraction ii,; almost eliminated. "\\'ith as many as twenty pairs (the usual number) the probable frror of the resulting· latitude ii,; about 0".1.

HYDROGRAPHY.

This branch of the Survey is represented by a sextant, for tlie determination of time and latitude at sea and on land, and for hydrographic work for mea:;:nrement of augles not exceediug 1200; by mercurial and metallic maximum and minimum thermometers, used in taking deep-sea temperatures; two varieties of logs or current meters, for determination of speed of a vessel through the water, or velocity of a current, and b~- t.wn varietieR of saliuurneters, as used for the determination of the density of sea water. One form is the ordinary float with graduated stem, the density being directly indicateu lJy tbe depth to which tlH=' tloat sinh. This form cannot lJe used at st>a where the motion of the vessel would preYent the float from settliug. l 'or determinatiom; at sea au optical densimeter is use.d, the construction of which llllpemls upou the refractive index of watel'. In principle, the apparatus'is a spectroscope, the prism lieing a pl'ism of the wate1· to he examined. The water is held in a triangular bottle. In two sides of the bottle are circular windows closed by pieces of the finest parallel glass. The ra~- of light passing through these windows passes through a prism whose density changes with the density of tl1e water held in the bottle.

V. MAGNETICS.

The instruments representing· this brauch of the SmTey are a unifilar maguetometer and a dip-circle. The former is used for the ddermination of the magnetic declination, or variation of the needle, and the lwri,;;ontal component of the magnetic force. A holJow magnet, having at one end a scale which is in the principal focus of a collimating lens at the other end, is suspended by a single delicate sHk fiber. The scale reading corresponding to the magnetic axis is determined by suitable observations. The fiber having been freed from torsion as far as possible, and the magnet being allowed to hang free, it settles into the rnaguetic meridian, and pointings upon the proper scale division represent pointings upon the magnetic meridian. \Vith a small theodolite attached to the instrument there is measured t be angle between the magnetic meridian and any convenient terrestrial mark. The azimuth of.the latter from the instrument being determined by other observations, we derive the angle between the true a11d magnetic meridian, or the magnetic declination. The horizontal component of the magnetic force is deduced from observation!l of the time of vibration when the magnet is ge11tl;y drawn from the magnetic meridian and allowed to oscillate freely, these observations being combined with others which iudicate the power of the

magnet to deflect from the magnetic meridian another magnet suspended in its place, the former magnet beiug applied at right angles to the maguetic meridian aml at known distanceR thnefrorn. The dip-cirr.le is used for the determination of tlle magnetic dip which iR derived from the din~ct readings 011 a vertical circle of a magnet mounted to swing free!~· in a vertical plane. The vertical comp011c·nt of tlie magnetic force is deduced from the observed effect of known weights ap11lfrd iwar one or the other end of the needle a'; known distances from its axi8.
YI. PrnLICA 'l'IONS.

The puhliC'atious of the Sune;y are rl:'preeented li;v a set of the volumes of the annual reports; by various scieutific worlrn, or papers, publiehed separately from the annual reports; !Jy volumes of the Coast I'ilot; copies of the annual Tide Tables for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts; a catalogue of 11pwards of six lmudred dwrt1> published by the Sunpy; a selection of the principal copper plates, lithographic, and pbotolithographic charts, and by a large isogouic chart, iu two sheets, of the magnetic declination in the United States.

MISCELLANEOUS.

In addition to the above there is a model of tlie obserYing tripod as used in fiat or wooded countries, to overcome the cun·ature, or to eleYate a theodolite above trees. The one here shown is a model of one in which the instrument was mounted at a height of 106 feet from the ground. There ii:; also sliown a 11ew form of leYel lmlh, the device of G. ~. Saegmuller, chief mechanician of the Coast and Geodetic Sur~ey. The level bulbs are frequently impaired by leakage or by the formation of crystals on the inner surface of the tube. Iu the ordinary form, where the end of the tube is bermeticalJ~· sealed, it is impossible to repair or remedy these defects. In the form liere showu, oue eml is draw11 to 11H' shape of a neck of a bottle which is ground, and ::t gronndglass sto1ippr h; fitted to it. When the tube ii,; fillc·d the eud is closed, at1d the stopper held in place with a little wax. If trouble occurs from leakage, or from the formation of crystals, it is a simple matter to remove the stopper and fill or clean the tube. A model of the Gulf of Mexico illustrates the results of bydrograp1iic surve;ys made in 1876-'78 h.v the Coast Sur-.ey steamer make. This model shows in a striking manner the formation of the bottom of the Gulf; the ver_y gradual ~leepening of tlte water all aloug the coast of the United Htates, except immediately off tlle mout11 of the Mississip1>i RiYer, where the 100.fatborn curve come;:; witbiu a few miles of land, while off the Wf'Rti>rn coaRt of Flori<l::i (:rnd aJ;:;o off the northern ernl of Yucatm1) tllis curve is at i,;oml' poi11ts !learl_y a 111rndrt>d mile8 from lam!. On passing the 100-iathom curve the descent is everywhere vei-,y rapid to a comparativdy level bottom at a depth excerding 2,000 fathoms. 'fbe narrow and comparatively shallow outlet of the Gulf Stream is forcibly shown, as also the much greater depth of the inlet from the Caribbean Sea.

custom the English system of weights and measures is ordinaril~' used in the United States for the purposes of trade and commerce, but by act of Congress the metric system is legalized and is much used in scientific work. The General Government has supplied to each State full sets of weigl1ts and measures of each system, and a complete set of both is here exbihited. Tl1e customary Ret comprises a half-bushel, peck, half-peck, and quart, made of brass; a gallon, quart, and pint, made of white meta:] ; weights from 25 pounds to one-quarter ounce and from 500 grains to ~O grains, of brass, and from 10 grains to 1 grain, of aluminium, the series allowing the formation of an~' combination from 1 grain to 51 pounds; and a yard scale divided to inches and tentl1s, with a matrix for the comparison of end ~-ards. The metric set comprises a brass line meter, subdivided to decimeters, centimeters and millimeters, with a tracing apparatus for copying from these onto another bar; a steel end.meter; a brass myriagram, kilogram demi.kilogram and gram, with subdivisions of the latter in platinum; and a brass liter and dekaliter. The weights and measmes exhibit further comprises a delica.te comparing apparatus for the micrometric com11arison of standard line measures from a decimeter to a meter in length. This

Tht· historical accounts here girnn of rli,.coYery and exploration on the cnasts of the United States were prc>pared by Ur. ,J. G. Kohl, a g<·ogrnpher of disti11ctim1, at the illst:mce of Prof. .A. D. Bache, the Snpcri11ternlc11t of tht· Coast ;-ltn·1·ey at the tirne (18;')4) of Dr. Kolil's dsit to this countr,y. But a few years had then chtp::wd since the beginning of the surwy 011 the Pacific coast, and the waut of an authoritatin~ :wd couueetcd account of early exploration upon that coast was greatly folt. Trustworthy data were needed to estalJlish the origin of geographical names, to decide disputed points of ortbograph,Y, to i<fontif_y localities uametl by early explorers, and to show the condition of discovery and fix tile limit of geographical knowlellge at varion,; pe.riods. The work undertaken by Dr. Kohl included, at the request of Professor Bache, in addition to the historical account, a general map illustrating it, a collection of maps showing the range and limits appe.rtaining to each discoverer and explorC'r, a list of names of hays, capes, harbors, &<'., with critieal remark;;, arn1 a catalogue of I.woks, maps, mauuscriptt:i, &c., relative to discoveries. In so sati;;factory a manner was this work performed for the. Pacific coast that Dr. Kohl was asked to undertake a similar work for the coast of the Atlantic and Gulf of ~foxico. Upon its completion the entire work was depositccl for reference in the itrclii ves of tlie S1uvey. Means for itis publication, aR a whole, uot having been available, it has now been deemed desirable to pulilisli the historical portions in the form of an appendix to this report. To each memoir is appended a list of the collection of maps. Some of tllese maps are copied from origiua.ls, others from old manuscripts or rare prints, and those of more modern origin are of interest as links in tlie cliain of his· torical connection.

THE NORTHMEN.

111 the parly history of ScandinaYia it is known that maritime enterprise was a marked characteristic of tht' inhabitants. "At the close of the ninth century some Northmen bad passed l':outlnrnnl tlirougll Italy aud Sicily, and aft.Pr leaving colonies passed across the Mediterranean to tht· rn:ms1 of Africa. Tlwy fomu.led settlements in France, England, Scotland, Ireland, Iceland, and 011 t\w c·na"t of Gree11lanll, and it is probable that one early nortllern adventurer visited the l'l1!-\tl'rn c·oai,;t of North Anwrica. Doubtless many fables were included iu the narratives of their carl.Y JJH\·igation, but om vresent concem is with the facts which have led historiaus to regard l:kandiuavia a;; the "storehouse of nation.y." '.l.'lw tin;t Scaullinn ,·iau adventnrPr who lam.led on the shores of Iceland was a certain Na1ldod, in tlie year Sm. Hio1lt-if, InguH; and other Northmen followed in the sear 874, and in the course of a century t11e is 1 arn1 wai-; COYflred witl1 flourishing settlement8, ]frequent voyages were ma.de from tlieuce to Norwa~., to lreland, and to .England. l u the year 980 one of these Icelandic navigator;;, Gnn!Jiorn, returrwd to his country, and sta.fod that he had been driven out of his course so fa1· Wt>stw:ml as to have in vi<·" a great unknown laQl-1. When this report was kno.wn, Eirek, who had been an outlaw in Iceland, sailed in the year 982 westward to search for Gunbiora'a Lanil.

He wintered there, returned to Iceland and Norway, and praised the newly discoYered land so highly that in subsequent years many Icelanders and Northmen went over to Greenland (as Gunbiorn's Land was soon called), and there- formed a colllmu11ity. One of the set_tlerR -was a certain Heriulf, who had left a son named Biarni at home. The sou set out to follow his father, but was driven hy stormy weather over to another unknown country, along which be coasted for some time. Finally he turned, reached ti-reenland, and there his report concerning the 1ww western country was eagerly listened to, and especially by Leif, the son of Eirek, the first settler in Greenland. Lief bought the ship of Biarni, and with it sailed towards the southwest. He found a great rocky country, which he named Helluland, i.e., the stony country. This was prohahl,v N ewfouudland. Leif, sailing farther to the southward and westward, again made the coast, and named it llfai·kland lthe country of the woods], and it is supposed to be Nova Scotia. Keeping the samt' general course, the vessel passed around a far projecting peninsula which was named Kiliaruax, i. e., Ship's Nose. This was probably Cape Cod, and the convei1ient bay in which he anchored i:-; j11dged to he Narragansett Bay. Leif and his rneu made on the shore of this bay a small 8ettll'ment, called Leif's budir, i. e., J,eif's cottages. They explored the vicinity, and finding grailes in almndance they applied the name Yinland. In the following ;year, 1001, Leif and his men filled · their ship with firewood, and returned to Greenland. Other expeditions followed. One in the year 1002 was nuder the command of Thorwahl, a brother of l<~irek; another in 1005 was conducted by Thorstein; and iu 1007 a third set. out nrn1er Thortinn Carlsefn. The last named adventurer intended to make a permanent settlement in Viulaud. He therefore brought over 160 men. He was accompanied by his wife, Gudrid, and their son, Snorri Tborfinson, was born in Vinland. Gudrid subsequently made a pilgrimage to Uome, and perhaps in that way some knowledge of the western countrJ' was spread in Italy. The Scandinavian colonies of Greenland remained for some ;rears iu connection with Icelancl, attracted settlers from Europe, flourished, and finally covered a tract of nearly 400 miles along the coast of the peninsula. But activity ceased. After Thortinu (1007) an expedition went occasionally. It is mentioned that a certain Grnlleif Gudlaugson went to Vinland iu the year 102i;. He is said to have sailed soutliward to a countr~- which he called Huitramannaland, i. e., the country of white men. Possibly the expeditions of the Northmen from Greenland to the eastern coast of North America were rep£oated, while the Greenland colonies flourished. The last was according to Rafn, tl1e learnecl Danish investigator, performed in the year 1347. So this series of expeditious to America can be traced through four centuries, but even the memory of it was lost in the decline of Scandinavian colonies in Greenland. They seem to have been weakened by pestilence, and at times they suffered. from the hostile attacks of the aborigines.
SEBASTIAN CABOT, 1497.

After the Northmen, the first European who touched on the Atlantic coast of North America was Sebastian Cabot, son of John Cabot, a Venetian merchant, who was settled in Englaud in tlw · time of King Henry VII. Columbus at the outset of his career ha<l offered his services to the court of England, but there the offer was refused. Cabot says that the report of the voyage of Oolumbus "increased in his heart a great flame of desire to attempt some notable thing." He believed, as Columbus did, that the eastern parts of Asia could not be very distant, and therefore he proposed to sail westward in higl1 latitude, or, as be expressed the idea, "because he understood by reason of the sphere that the northwestern route would be a shorter trace to come to India." The king ordered two caravals to be fitted out, and in the year 1495 issued letters patent, i11 which be granted to the undertakers and commanders of the expedition the usual rights and privileges" to discover, and conquer for him, the· King of England, an;v yet heathen country, and t{) oocupy it for him and for themselves as his lieutenants, vassals, and governors." In these royal letters Sebastian Cabot, his father, John, and likewise two brothers, are named as the grantees, aud hence some.writers have inferred that both father and son conducted the expedition across the ocean. Bnt it seems more probable that the wealthy merchant, John Cabot, was named in the H.Ex.43-63

royal letters only bec'.4nse lie assiste1l the expedition with money. Mor<'oYer, Sebastian states that his father died previous to the year 1497, in which year the voyage was undertaken. Cabot sailed westward, keeping along the 50th parallel to Newfoundland, which had been previously known to the Nortlmrnn m11for tl1e name of Helluland. After making laud he steered northward, but not finding the desired passage to China he turned south all(} passed along tlrn coast of what is now knowu as the Sew Bngland Stat.es. The southern limit reached has been the im~iect of doubt. Some suppose that he tnrned at the 38th parallel, bnt others judge that he went to the vicinity of Cuba. Peter Martyr, Gomara, aIHl other authorities make it certain tliat. lie reached the entrance of Delaware Ifay. Hakluyt RtateR rl'peatPclly that Cabot drew maps and wrote reports of hi,; 11i:-;coverieR, hut they have lleeu unfortunately lost. "\Ve luwe, howe\·er, a delineation of the eastern coa:-it, accorcling to Cabot's report, 011 the map h_y .Juan de la Cosa in the year lfiOO. That map confirms thebelief alrParl,v expresRe<l in regard to the southern limit of Cabot's ,·o;yage. SomA authors intimate that Cabot made voyages to America in the years 1498, 1499, aml 1517, but ~lie particnlarR .of Ruch, if the vo;rageR were madl', are not ]mown to ns. The Portuguei:m expeditioJJs across the northern parts of America by the Brethren Uortereal, are of interest· only iu regard to the Arctic regions.
PONCE DE LICON, 1ril2.

Sebastian Cabot bad "taken possesRion" in the name of the King of England of the eastern coast of the New '\Vorl1l, mul in later times the English founclecl on his <liRcO\'f'ries their right to 11ominion. The Portuguese did not promptly pursue the nortl1ern tliscoYeries commenced by the Cortereals. By the Spanish, th<> exploration of the northern part of Cnha wits 11ot taken in hand until the year 1508, and iu that year their navigator, Ocampo, circnmnavigated that island for tlie first time. Excepting tlie French, Portng1wse, and Biscay:m fishermen, who, since 1504, ;\'early went to Newfoundland, we do not know with certainty of any Enropea11 expedition to the easte,rn coast of America hetWP('Il the ;years 1501 aml 1512, when Ponce de r~eon lt>d in that direction. Some JNlrS earlier he had conquered and settled the iRland of Porto Rico, aml lwlll possession there as ~over nor. 1''hen deposed, in conRequence of Rome misunderstancling with bis officers, and with the court of Spain, lie waR rich. He was yet in the force and bloom of his life, and be was enterprising. He listenPd to what was related of unknown countries. The 1uclians told of a great country callecl Ca11tio, and of the existence of a fountain or river, Bimin·i, whieh had the quality of restoring youth and Rtrengtb to those who bathed in its waters. Attracted by the traditions, Ponce de Leon fitted out three ships ant! sailed with them on the ~1l of March, 1.512, from the harbor St. German, in Porto Iiico. He passed along the northern side of the Lucayan Islands, kept a northwestern course, and near (Jape Canaveral saw the coast of tlie North American continent on the 27th of March (Palm Sunda.r), which the Spaniards call Pascua Florilla de He1mrreccion. At first 11e judged that the land i11 view was a small island, like one of tlie Lucaya11 Islamls which he had just left, but be sailed along with the continuous coast in view until the 2(1 of April, and then applied the name, La Florida as well because of the flourishing 118· pect as al!m that he i,mw it first on the Sunday of Pascua Florida. He sought for a harbor, and not finding a good one turned southward. On the 8th of 1\fo;v Ponce doubled a large cape where the currents gave much trouble, and wbicli he therefore named Cabo de Oorrientes (cape of the currents), which Herrera puts in latitude 28° 15' uorth, and consequently it was Cape Caiiaveral. In going sout.hward several small isl· ands were noticed but these cannot be identified, as many inlets have been opened and closed again in the course of time hy the action of the sea. Pouce de Leon doubled the Cape of Florida without attaching a name, and soon after discovered the Florida Kt>ys, or Martires, the Tortugas, and the western coast of the Florida peninsula. On his return Yoyage to Porto Rico, one of the sl1ips was sent in command of Perez de Ortubia and Antonio de Alaminos toward tlie no1thwest to search again for the island and fountain of Bimini. Their report is meager, and no mention is wade in it of the coast of Florida.. They appear to have sailed only amongst the Lncayan Islands.

Lucas Vasquez de Ayllon was on the coast in the year 1520, but a few years earlier some voyages of secondary interest were made. An English ship is said to have sailed at this 11eriod southward from Newfoundland to the Antilles and Porto Rico. Among-st Spanish authors who mention this Yoyage, Herrera puts its arrival at Porto Rico iu the year 1519; others have put it in the year 1517. Herrera, whom we follow, says that" in the y£>ar 1519 arrived an English vessel in the island of S. Juan [Porto Rico], which was examined by Spanish officers, and tile commamler of which stated that Uiey bad been for the discovery of a northwest passage or oceanic route to the Gran Can, i.e., to China, from England to Newfoundland, thence southwest to the river Chicora, and that from there they had come in a southern direction to Porto Rico." As the expedition is mentioned as English, some ha.Ye supposed that Sebastian Cabot was the commander. Cortes, in the same :year (1519), sent out Antonio de Alaminos with dispatches for Spain. He passed through the Gulf of Florida and the Strait, of Bahama, !Jut did not land on the eastern coast of Florida, though at several· times the land was in view. Passing by ibe Burmudas he returned to Spain. Diego Miruelo, a well-known Spanish pilot, doubtless made voyages in these re~ious on his own acconut. His moYemeuts fill the inter\·al between Ponce de Leon aud Vasquez de Ayllon.
LUCAS VASQUEZ DE AYLLON,
15:10-15~5.

Lucas V1tsquez de Ayllon wa.s a Spanish officer eminent h,y litt·rary attainments. He was some time auditor of the royal court of San Domingo, and had ueconw wealthy iu hi:s employment. When laborers beca~ scarce iu the Lneayas and in tlJe Antilles, A~·llon, with some others, made an expeditiou to tlie north to kidnap Irnlian slaves. They fitted out two Yessels, and Ayllon took command. Diego Miruelo went as pilot. In the course of the year 15:?0 they followed the track of J>ouce de I.. eon, and passing around the Lueayan falamls they arrived <Lt the shore of a great country, which, hy the aborigines, was called Chicora. On that part of the coast they named a cape "Cal.Jo de 8anta Elena," as it was first seen hy them on the day of that saint. This was probably a point of land near SaiHt Helena Sound on the coast of South Carolina. Iu that yiciuity Ay1lon named a rfrer after one of his captains, "Ri<I Jordan." The ext.ent of the voptge is not well defined, either by Herrera or Oviedo. Barcia says that tlie part.y lande<l at se1·eral pla~es, and on nearly contemporary Spanish maps we find the names "Oabo S. Romans/' ''Riv. Oanoas," "Callo de Trafalgar," and others that snggest A;yllon as liayiug applied them. It is, however, possible that some of them were not given by Ayllon on his first voyage in 1520, hut rather on his second expedition in the year 1525. He went to Spain after his first voyage, and was commissioned by the king to explore, conquer, and settle that promising country. But by reason of various hnpedimeuts bis second voyage was delayed. One of the biudrances will be mentioned. A certain Ortiz de Matien~o, also a Spanish civil officer, and like Ayllon, provided with vessels, prot.ested against Ayllon's expedition because one of Matien!to'i> ships ha·l made the same disco\·ery. B11t Ayllou, uotwithstaucling the protest, sailed to Chicora. He merely added another name, that of the river "Guale" or "GtJ.aldape.," or, as Oviedo writes, ·:Guadalupe," which is state(l as being about 30 miles south of the Point Saint Helena, aud possibly it was Savauuah River. In an unfortunate expedition against. Indians at some distance from the coast, A,:rllou and manj' of his men w01·e killed. The survivors of the party returned to the Antilles. Pre\·iouslr Florida had been regarded as an island, but the ex11edition of Ayllou determined its Jleuinsnlar configuration.
JOHN DE VERRAZANO, 1524.

Chrisliopher Columbus and his brother Bartholomew, before acceptance in Spain, had made propositions to the court of France, and at one tim\l it seemed probable that their offer would be there accepted. French pirates and adVfmturers were early followers of the Spaniards to the West Indies. After the year 1504 French navigators of Dieppe and other ports of France crossed the ocean to the banks of :Newfoundland and returned to Europe with :fish. Francis I wa11, however, the first French king who sent an expedition specially intended for

the discovery of new lauds. The command of it was given to an Italian, John de Verrazano, who belonged to Florence., At the end of the year 1523 Verrazano sailed from Dieppe with four ships. Un his arrival at Madeira, only one vessel, the Dolphin, was found seaworthy, and in that, with fifty men, he started westward. After sailing about 900 leagues by bis reckoning, and after being fifty days at sea, he sighted the coast of America in the neighborhood of Cape Fear. From theuce he sailed northwnrd, and, following the trend of the coast, must have passed the entrances of Uhesapeake aml Delaware Ua;vs. Finally he reached a very pleasant place showing steep hills, and an exccediug great stream of water, so deep at the mouth that any great ship might pass np. He entered with bis boats, and found the country thickly peopled. Circumstances did not permit him to proceed inland, so he sailed 50 leagues eastward as the trend of the coast was in that direction. From this it seems evident that Verrazano touched the mouth of Hudson River and New York Harbor. For some time the Hudson was caUed "the river of the hills or mountains." His rne11tion of the trend of the coast eastward makes it certain that Verrazano was the first European who visited the entrance of the Hudson. Sailing along the sea coast of Long Island, he seems to have regarded it as part of tbe mainland; but in going eastward he soon disco>ered au island somewhat triangular in outline. This he named L'isle Claudia, in honor of the mother of Francis I. Some authors ha>e judged this to be Block Island, but by others it has been, wit.h more probability, taken as Martha's Vi11eyard. HoweYer that might have been, Verrazano sailed over to a great and commodious harbor or bay, in 4li degrees of north latitude, and there remained fifteen days, trading with the nath·es and exploring the country. This bay was 20 leagues in circuit and contained five pleasant and fruitful islands, "among th~ which islands [he says] our great navy may ride sate, without an;y fear of tempest or other danger." From this description it seems clear that Verrazano had entered Narragansett Bay. It is remarkable that he was at this time the first to mention the name "Island of Rhodes," which afterwards was adopted as a designation. On the 5th of Ma;y, 1524, Verrazano left, and sailing east and then north for 150 leagues, found the coast studded with crags, the shore haviug many turnings and windings between them, offering fair harbors. He counted thirty.two islands on tliat part of the coast. Plainly he was then on the coast of Maine. He does not mention the remarkable projection now known as Uape Cod. From the coast of Maine he sailed northeast about 150 leagues, and when off Newfoundland turued back and reached the coast of France early in July, 1524. It is not known that Verrazano made an;y maps. In his report mention is made of latitude, and be assigned no names, excepting tlutt of the island Claudia. But he indicates with tolerable accuracy the trending of the coasts and distances. He imw the entire coast from Cape Fear northward to the Bay of Fundy, and his descriptions are tolerable. From what he says, Narra.gan8eU Bay and Hudson River entrance can be readily identified. Ramusio says that Verrazano and several of his men were killed by savages; but some Spanish historians record that be was captured in 1524 and hanged by their countrymen.
ESTEVAN GOMEZ, 1521'. ·

The Spaniards advanced slowly towards the north. Pre>ions to the year 1525 not one of their navigators had passed the thirtieth parallel. Ayllon's north limit was the boundary of Spanish research in that direction. Beyond that voyages bad been made only by tbe English, Portuguese, and I<rench; by Cabot, Cortereal, Verrazano, and others. Yet none doubted that there was much land in the higher latitudes. Newfoundland and Labrador were included under the name ,, Baccalaos," and between that and Florida the Spaniards supposed there mig·ht be a strait. True, Cabot and Juan de la Cosa had represented the coast as continental, but they did not look into each inlet, nor explore as minutely as Verrazano. Moreover, maps of that period showed a.n open gap or branch of ocean between Baccalaos and Florida. So, also, years after the voyage of Columbus to Veragua and tbehlthmus of Panama, maps showed a channel, which it was thought might have been overlooked by that navigator. In the year 1525 the Spaniards fitted out an expedition in the hope of reaching China by a water passage around the continent of· North America. Estevan Gomez, who had been with Magellan, was put in cha.I'ge, and his expectation

was to repeat in .a high northern latitude what had been done at the southern extremity of South America. In fact, the notion was then somewhat common that geographical configuration at the north should correspond with that at the south. Estevan Gomez sailed with one ship from the port of Corunna, at the end of tlle year 15~..t, directly over to Baccalaos [Newfoundland], and tliere turned and passed southward along the eastern coast of North .America. There is no journal of his voyage uor copies of maps which he doubtless made. S1>anish authors merely allude to the voyage. It is known, howeYer, that be followed the course of his predecessor, Verrazano, merely reversing the order by passing from DOI'th to south. Oviedo says that Gomez sailed southward to the fortieth parallel, and that he brought some Indian prisoners home to Spain. Herrera says: Gomez sailed much further to the southward, and trayeled from Florida to Uuha where he remained some time, and then returned to Europe. After an absence of ten montbs he was again at Corunna in No\~ember, 1525. That lie brought home a map aud description of tbe country e:xplored is evident from the map of' .America made by Diego Ribero a fow years after. Without doubt he took the configuration of the coast from Home:>:, as neither before nor soon after was that part of the coast visited by any Spauiard. Ribero gh·es to the entire region the name of tlle explorer, " .Tierm de Esteiian Gomez,'' and this umy be regarded as the first name applied to New Bngland. Jt, was retained on uearl~· all maps of the sixteenth century. Gomez r,aud was the name commonl;1' appplied, until it was disi)Jaced by English discoveries. Two capes marked by Gomez ap1rnar mi nearly all subl'equent maps, namely: "Cabo de Muchas Isla;;" fcape of many islands] and "Cabo d11 .Arenas," i. e. the cape of sand. The first 1wems to be Cape Elizabeth, 011 the coast. of Maine: the other was either Cape May or Cape Henlopen. The sea between the extreme capes is marked 011 tlie map "Arcl1i pelago de EsteYan Go111ez," but on subsequent maps the name of tl1e navigator is omitted. To the nort.heast of Cape Cod a broad inlet is invariabl.'' marked us "Rio de las Garuas" (Deer Hiver), and perhaps it is what is uow known as Penobscot Bay.
ENGLISH VOYAGE, 1527

Hakluyt relates (Vol. III, p. 129) t:hat Master Hobert Tllorne, of Bristol, a man of ll'amiug and inilnencc, moYed King Henry VIII to encourage discovery in the northern parts of the new world. Two s11ips were fitted out, one of them lwariug the name Domi1ms VohiRcmu. One of the \'esscls was wrecked OJJ the coast of Labrador, the other went towards Ca11e Bretou and the coast. of New England. .After landing to look at the country, tbe vessel returued home early in October of the year 1527.
SPA.NISH EXPEDITIONS, 1528--lri4:1.

Estevan Gomez nnd Lucas Va!lquez de ,t\y1lon returned from the eastt>rn coast of Nortb America, one to Spain, the otbe1· to the Antilles with miserable Indian prisoners or slaves iu lieu of expected riches. But the impression yet remaine<l that wealth might be gained by g-oing further westwanl aml that a region of gold might be reached hy passing through the Mexican Gnlf. There followed. consequentl,y two laud ex1ieditions in that direction, one under Narrnez iu the year 1528; the other under I·'ernando de Soto in 1538. The ill-fated e;xpeditiou of N:nT:wz was attended by five >essels which carried four hundred men and eight.y horses. After Jamliug at Tampa Bay the vessels passed on and tl1e laud force peri8hed in the attempt to pass westward along tbe coast in boats. De Soto wintered at .Apalachee and then marched through territory which is now known as the State of Georgia. His 1and of promise was "Gofachiquc," a name by which Spani:;;li authors have designated Savannah River. On reaching the country of the l1icenciado Ayllon, he fouml amongst the Indians B-Ome iron tools and weapons, probably remai11s of Ayllon~s expedition of 1520 and 1525. The Indians described to De Soto several encounters witl1 Ayllon's men. Hoping steadily to find in the interior another land like Mexico or like Peru, the varty exam· ined the country and probably were in the region now occupied by Pensacola. After two years

of travel and toil, De Soto e»ded his life in the interior of the Mississippi country. His two captairns, Diego Maldonado and Gomez Arias, waited in vain according to his orders, supposing that he might have returned from the interior by another route, but finally they made a series of expe· ditious along tlie Atlantic aIJ(l Gulf coasts, but of these it is probable that detailed reports were not written. Garcilasso, Herrera, and :Barcia as:iert that the expedition went along over the Atlantic coast northward to "Baccawos," and looked into every harbor a111l eYery bay in search for De Soto. In the interval of thirty-six year8 preceding the French expedition nuder Hibaut in 15G2 there is uo record of any Spaui8h exploration. The mapi; and geographical descriptiom; of that period are marked with new mmH'8, but we cannot refer them either to Estevan Gomez (1324) or to Ayllon (1520-1525). The most remarkable description of that time is contained in the second voluwe of Oviedo's H i::;tory of the ,,..est Indies. '\Ve here append a summary; but it i:s t.o he regretted that the date of t1e ma11uscript is uncertain. ·we know, however, that Oviedo published the first Yo1ume of hi:s history iu 111f year 153u; and that iu the year 1557, when he died, the second volume, which contains the description here in question, was ready for the printer. Oviedo hep:ins his description at the southward with what he calls" Punta de la Florida," and that lit· stah·s as in latitude 25*0 north. The cape discovered· by Po11cCJ de Leon ill 1512, and whieh lie named Cabo de Corrientes [Cape of Currents], is called by O\'iedo Gabo de Caiiat,eral. But no practical purpose would he met b;y recapitulating the names given on old Spanish nuips to Jiartkula1· places. The " Cape Trafalgar" of that period is our Cape Hatteras. 0\'iedo 111t'th()(1ically states distances from points a.ml river eI1tranees iu goiug nortllward. Few of the· places can be identified, but bis de&criptiou of Saint Antonio Hiver, which is "in a line tlirect from the uortlt tH the i;:outli," leaYes little doubt that be passed up the Hudson River. E8tevan Gona·z was in that Yicinity iu the year 15U. From 0\'iedo's description it is eas.v to identi(y Long Islaud and also Lo11g Island Sound, as well m; ~arragansett Bay. Excepting Gomez and Ayllon, 0Yiedo does not name any explorer as affording him kuowledg«~, and it cannot be stated with certainty which of the mwigators finit saw and named Cape Trafalgar [llattcrasj, or ::faint Mary'1:1 Bay [Chesapeake], or Cape Arenas [Henlopen J, and others.
CAP'I'AIN JEAN RIBAU'I'.

Atlrniral Coligny, as chief of the Huguenots, sought an asylum for 11is persecuted brethren, and with the permission of tlie King (Charles IX) fitted ont two vessels in the harbor of Dieppe. lWmut was intrusted with the command of the expedition. He sailed on tlie 18th of February, 15G:?, and at the end of two months sighted a low cape which he named "Cap Frangois." This was doubtless sowe object seen on the coast of Florida near Saint Augm1tine. Be went uorthward from thence, probably because he wished to ayoid ground known to be under Spanhih dom1111on. After sailing no great distance he enteretl a broad river on the 1st of May, and named it ''La lfrdere de May." This was doubtless the Saint John's. In coasting 60 leagues further be disconred aud named eight rivers, giviug generally the names pertaining to well-known rivers in Fra11cP. l<'irntlly tlJe vessels entered a spacious sound and found it more commodious thnn others. This was by Hibant uamed Purt Royal, and there be concluded to make a settlement. Be explored the lnanchei->, and named them, but the names were not retained 011 subsequent maps. Some of his soJdiPrs, 1111d1·r commaud of a Captain Albert, were left in a fort which was named in honor of the Kiug of France," Charles li'ort." Ribaut went on to the mouth of Edisto River, and there finding that his provii;ions were becoming scarce he turned eastward and arrived on the coast of !·'ranee on the '.!Otb of July, 1562. Civil war then raged in that kingdom, and the little colony on the coai;t of North America was left without succor. By the efforts of Uoligny some vessels were sent to prntect the national interests; but in the interval the colony at Charles Fort sutfornd for want of 1mwisio111s. Dissensions broke out in the party, and the commander, Cap. tain Albert, was killed by turbulent members in his attempt to quell the revolt. At last they built a vessel, trusted tbemsehes to the ocean, and when in great distress were pfoked up a.t sea by an English ship, and thqs returned to Europe.

In the year 1564 tlJree Ye811eJs were fittf>d out, and the captain (Rene deLaudom1iere) who had accompanied Ribant on the firAt voyage wafl put in charge of the little fleet, and flailed from Hane on the 22ll of April, 15G4.

SIR JOHN HAWKINS, 1565.

Before relating the particulars of R.ihaut's Recond \oyage, it is proper to mention that after Hawkins rangPcl along the coast of Florida and left Laudouuforc, as already stated, the English comma1Hlf'r sailed northea.i;;t as far as Newfoundland. His n>yage is deflcrihed i11 IIak luyt's thiril \'olnmt>. Donhtles8 J1e made a map of this snrn-y, as he was the firRt English wwigator who elm~cl~- examined the coast of Florida, but the existence of Ruch map iR not known. On his Recond vo;vage Ribant arriwd at the river May on the 28th of Angirnt, lri<lii, and only a week later a At.rong Spanish fleet appeared tl1ere under the command of Dou Pedro Meuenckz, with orders from the King of Spai11 to eject. all heretics from the com1try of Flori!fa, that territory 11eing from olden time regarded aR Spanish dominion. The Spanish forces settle<! at a position a littl(· Routh of May Hiver and then moved against tl1e sma.U French force under Rihant and r~au1lo11u iere. ,Jean Hihaut and many others were killed in the attack. Laudonniere and Rome otlwr:;; ei;;caped in one of tlie vessels and reached France at the end of the year 1565. Two years later (15G7) the French captain, Gourgues, undertook t-0 chaRtise the Spanianls. Ilis expedition was conducted with courage, and it is remarkable, also, for tlie quick voyage made by the party. Gourgues sailed from France on tbe 22d of August, 1567, with one lnmdred aml fifty soldiers. Ile reached Florida in October, and in the course of the winter destroyed three Spanish forts at Saiut John's Rh·er and Saint Augustine Harhor, which were defended by numbers greater than his own. The garrisons were dispersed, but with his limited force, being unable to keep posses~ion for France, he sailed from Florida on the 3d of May, 1568, and after a \oyage of thirty-four days landed at Rochelle. But Charles IX of France regarded these expeditions to Florida as being in tbe in~reRt of Huguenots and favored by Colign~·. The King was unwilling to give any offenRe to tlie Spanish court, hence no otl1er effort was made from France. The names gi,·er1 hy adn~11turers from that power, with a Ringle exception, ''Port Royal Entrance," cfom.ppeared from maps of that pertoo.
FLORIDA, 1565-1574.

Don Pedro Menendez lie Aviles had distinguished himself as a commander of fleets and expe-

ditions in tl.te service of the King of SJlain. A son of de Aviles had served in the West IndieR and was finally shipwrecked on the coast of Florida, where he was supposed to be in ca.pth·it.r amongst
tbe savages. The father was permitt1;>-d to fit out an expedition for search, and was commissioned

also to explore the ~ountry and to make maps of tbe bays, harbors, cape1:1, and other geogra.pbical features of Florida. · While Meuendez was yet in port be had news of the French experlitions of Ribaut and Laudouniere, and it was rumored that a large reinforcement was on the way to Florida. T11e King of Spain therefore enlarged the fleet and army of Menendez, .1tnd direct;ed him to f'ject alJ foreigners and intruders from the country in which he was to opera.t.e.

504

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY.

Menendez sailed from Cadiz on tlie 2Hth of June, 1565, with thirty-four vessels and about three thousand penmns. But the ships were separated by storms. The commander, with some of the ships, sighted the coast of Florida on the 28th of August, the day of Saint Augustine. Where the l~re11ch had settled waH not 1.11own. They were supposed to be northward, and the fleet moved in that direction. A harbor was entered and explored. Laudouuiere, in the year 1564, Imel named it Rh·iere des Danphius, bnt -;\lrn1e11dez ealletl it San Augustin. Learning from the natives that the Frencll were on the coast fartller north, Menendez sailed on and found them at the mouth of the river l\fay, but they avoided bis intended attack. Not deeming it advisable to move on their fort witllout providing defenses on the coast for an emergency, he returned to Augustine Harbor and there erected a fortified camp. Soon after he marched and attacke1l the French fort "Caroline" by land and killed the greater part of the· garrison and settlers. He applied the name San Mateo, and the river )Ia.r took then the same mtlll('. The vigorous pursuit of the French led ~Ienemlez to various parts of the region, anrl be wa;; thus engagell during eight ;years after the y{'ar 1566. He establishell a small fort not far from Cape Florida, in the Indian proYince of Teguesto; the fort Santa Lucia, south of Cape Caiiaveral, at au indentation which the Spaniards called "Puerto de Is;" tlie fort in Saint Augw:;tine Harbor; the fort San Mateo, on the river Mar, i. e., Saint John's River; ~nd the fort San Felipe, at Saint Helena entrance. He dispatchell also a captain with thirt,y soldiers and Rome Dominican friars as far north ao; Chesapeake Bay, hut that expedition was unfortunate. The part,y 1leeming it inexpedient to settle there sailed for Spain. In the course of uine years Don Pedro l\Icneudez sailed at least twelve times around the penimmla of Florida. The llistorian Barcia records him as having a more intimate knowledge of the coast than auy man before his time. He explored the interior also, along the Saint Joh n's all<l the Rio Sala<lo, which it was supposed might be a passage toward the East Indies. Of the expeditious of Menendez the most interesting is recorded iu the narrative by his nephew, Pedro :Menendez Marquez, who was an able seaman and afterwards a commander of Spanish fleets. The nephew was accompanied by four ships and one lrnndred and fifty men. Barcia states that the exploration commenced at Cape Florida and was prosecuted northward beyond the eutrance to Chesapeake Bay. 'l'hlli bay (says Barcia) is 3 leagues broad at its entrance and it stretcheH towards the north-northwest, and bas many rivers and ports on botb side>1. His mention of souudings agrees so well with our charts that he must be regarded as one of the best amongst early explorers of Chesapeake Bay. 1\Ienendez died in the year 15i4, soon after his return from Florida. His forts and colonies were deserted, and it may be said that with him ended the age of Spanish expeditions on the Atlantic coast.
SIR WALTER RALEIGH.

Q,ueen Elizabeth of England granted to Raleigh, in the year 1584, certain letters patent, nearly in tenor like those granted by Henry VIi to Sebastian Cabot; and thus Raleigh was allowe<l to fit out naval and military expeditions, and to "discover, search, find out, and view such remote beathen and barbarous countries and territories as were not actually possessed of any Cliristian prince, and to hold them as her vicegerent." This patent was issued on the 25th M March, 1584, and on the 27th of the ensuing April the first expedition, fitted out by Raleigh at his own clrnrge, sailed under 11is command. Raleigh had interested in his enter1lri~e some wealthy merchants and other gentlemen, and at their joint cost two vesRels were provided with crews. They sailed from the Thames early in the year 1584, under command of Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlow, with instructions to explore the east coast of Florida, and find some convenient place for settlement. As usual at that time, the '·essels made for the West Indies entered the Gulf Stream between Cuba and Florida, and then went north and entered some convenient harbor. That they entered Ocracoke Inlet seems probable, as the report sayti that after entering they sailed. 7 miles north to the islantl of Roanoke. They named the entrl}nce "W okokeu," probably from Indian pronnncia.tion. In fact the first adventurers on the coast of Virginia. generally adopted Indian designations. On the tlrst map ot Virginia. (by John White) there is only one European name, that of "Virginia."

Amadas, Barlow, and their men did not advance westwanl i11to the sound whic11 is now known as Pamplico Sound. The.r aucl1ored at l~oanoke lsla11<1. There they !tad soml' frie)}(lly mtercourse with the aborigiues, and from them acquired names for the parts of tltat mgio11. The river wLid1 enters the sound, then called the ri\·er Neus, bears at this da~· the name Neuse l{iver. In September, 1584, tlmy returned to Englarnl, and their fanirable report suggested to Sir ·waiter Raleigh the proposal that tbe countr;v should be named "Virginia," which was done iu lHmor of Queen Blizabdh. Raleigh hastened preparations for an expedition to furthf'r explore and make settlement::; in the countr~·· Seven vessels were fit.ted out and placed in charg;e of Sir Richard Grenville. Of the . crews, most of the men had been in the earlier expedition, aud .Captain Azmttlas aceompanied the party. The vessels sailed from Plymouth ou the 9th of A.pnl, HiSJ, and, as usual, made for th1> West Imlies and passed in tbe Gulf Stream to the northm·n part of Florida. On the :!3d of Jnue they were near a cape and were in danger of shipwreck. This was named "Cape Fear/ and three days afterwards the vessels anchored in \Vocokon Inlet, whieli is now known as Ocracoke Inlet. Grenville passed seven da~·s in exploriug Pamplico Sonnd. From Hatteras Inlet a colony of oue hundred men was sent to Roanoke Island under Master Hal11J1 LauP, and, leaving )faster Philip Amadas in geueral command, Grenville returned, and arrived i11 E11gland on the 18th of October, 1585. Lane an.d Amadas passed the winter of 1U85-'8ti on R.oanokP hlall(], and in the spring made excursions toward the soutL and also west and northwest.

This last he explored in boats to a distance of 60 miles, and supposing that the som-ee was near .Mexico, arnl that by following the channel a passage might be made to the Soutl1 Sea, he traced it to the mmrntains in Lope of fimliug silver. Soon after, disputes with the nati\·es brought the colonists into distress. The supplies promised by Haleigh and Grenville did not arrin. Fortunately, Sir Frm1cis Drake, on his return from the West Indies and Florida, iIHJnired, in order to report the state of the colouy in England. He offered provisions, and a ,-essel and boats, but the discouraged colonists requested him to take them home, so the first Virginia colony arrived with Drake at Portsmouth on the '.!7th of July, 1586. Meanwhile, Haleigh ha<l <fa1patchell a ship witL provisiom; for the relief of the colony, and soon after three ships under Sir Richard Grenville. All arrived safoly 11ot long after the departure of Drake; but fiudiug no one alive at the site of the colony, Sir Richanl left fifteen men, provisioned for two years, ·on the Island of Roanoke.

COAST OF NEW ENGLAKD,
160~-1605.

After the time of Yerrazano and Estevan Gomez (1524-'25) and the voyage of the English ships iu 1527, we know not of an;y expedition to the shores of New England until the year 1602. 'l.'he French expeditions under Cartier and bis successors were confined to the region of Canada. The vo,yage of Sir Humphrey Gilbert was intended for the acquisition of Newfoundland, hut was unfortunate. His yessel, when returning, foundered at.sea, on the 12th of September, 1583. At t11at periorl many French, Portugue:se, and English fishermen resorted to the sawe quarter, but notlling wat'i thus added to geographicaiknowle<lge. The maps were such as were given by Gomez all(l Yt·rraza110; aud the coast was designated generally as Norumbega. A great river was marked with that name, but on some maps" Rio de Garn as," L c., Deer Hi\' er. The island "Claudia," mentioned hJ' Yt·rrazano, was graphically conspicuous; but the configuratiop of the coast was Yery erroneous]~· · 1·eprese11t<'tl; ou some, so prominent a feature as tlw Bay of Fu111:1y is not shown. By Spaniards the region was rneutioned as the" Northern parts of Florida." The French named it "Nouvelle France"; and after Raleigh's expedition the English st;yled it as the ''Northern parts of Virginia." After "White':s unfortunate voyage in liJ90, twelve years ela11sed without further action on this part of the Atlantic coast.
GOSNOLD AND GILBERT, 1602.

Capt. Bartholomew Gosnold saile<l in a small bark, with thirty.two men, on the 26th of l\1arcll, 1602, from Falmouth, England. From the Azores he steered due west, but all preceding na>igators, in sailing for America, shaped their course for the vVest Indies. Ht' reached the coa8t in the vicinit~· of the fort~··third parallel, and there his men took great numbers of codfish. The nearest cape received at that time the name " Cape Uod," and the Indians were found in possession of some European implements. Gosnold, sailing southward, paissed the island ot N antueket, but went ashore at the next and named it "Martha's Vineyard," because, as he says, it aboimde«l iu straw berries and other fruits. He found also deer and other animals. In crossiug to the mainlaml he passed several small isla11ds. His meu were willing to remain, but not being wdl }ll'OYided, tlley sailed eastward, and arri>ed in Eugla.ml on the 23d of July, 1602.

SoOJJ after the return of Gmmold, the mayor of the citr of Bristol (.Tohn Whitson), the historian Hicllanl Hakluyt, and other gentlemen, formed acompany and fitted out two ,-essels, wl1ich were })laced in command of Martin Pring. He was accompanied by Robert Salterne, who had been one of Gosnold's pilots. The vessels reached the coast of America somewhat north of . the fortJ·-third parallel. The .country seen was high and covered with woods, and hence the landfall was certainl;y north of Cape Cod. It was probably in the neighborhood of Penobscot Bay. lie named an island" Fox Island," and going southwest he entered several rivers, and finally 1iasRed into Cape Cod Ba~', which had been missed in the preceding year by Captain Gosnold.

BARTHOLOMEW GILBERT, 1603.

An ineffectual attempt was made by Captain Sam·el Mace, in 1602, to settle in Virginia. In t,hat year Bartholomew Gilbert bad been with Gosnold to seek out the position of the settlers left in those parti,; by Sir Walter Raleigh in the year i587, but he was unfortunate. He landed near the entrance o1' Ghesapeake Ba;y, but was slain by Indians, with bis principal men~ So, without effecting anything in the way of exploratioJJ, the vessel returned to England in charge of Master Henr~T Sute.
SIEUR DE MONTS .AND CHAMPL.A.IN, 160&.

Henry IV of France commissioned the Sieur de Monts, a very enterprising na-vigator, to conquer and settle the countries in La Nouvelle France betwoon the 40th and 46th parallels of

latitude, and to him the King issued a commission as lieutenant-general of 8ne11 territor~· i11 America. De Monts sailed on the 7th of March, 1604, from Ilavre, and hy tlie usual route of French. vessels reached Newfoumlla11d, Campsean, and l'Acadic [Nova Scotia]. He co11tiuued westward, and finally passed southward to tlie 40th parallel. Passing arouud Cape Sable he entered what was then called "La Baye I1'ram;oise," but which is uow kuown as the Bay of Fundy. Ou the 24th of June (day of .Tohn the Baptist), be entered a river mouth, and hence the name. One of his officers examined the river to a distance of 50 leagues. Froru the St. John River, De Monts, who on this vo;yage was accompanied by the Sieur Cbamplaiu, went 24 leagues further westward a1Hl entered Passamaquoddy Ba:1. They settled upon an island in Schoodic River, and named it "Isle de St. Croix."· After deciding to winter in the place, the larger vessels were sent to France. The winter being severe, it was deemed expedient to seek a place for settlement further southward, but it seems probable that tl.wy went no further than Penobscot Bay. The configuration of the entrance, in the descriptions of De Monts and L'Escarbot, is compared to the figure of the Greek letter Lambda. Further west lJe Monts entered another large rirer which the lmliaus called "Kinibeke;" and in the same direction a bay was entered and named "La Baye de Marchin," after a French officer. This no doubt is what is known as Ca.~co Bay. Near Cape Cod the party remained for some days, and ga·rn it the designation "Ca,zu: ilfole. barre." But, being then short of provisions, the Yessels returned to St. Croix. De Monts was succeeded by the Sieur du Pont, who fitted out a Yessel at J>ort Royal, in Nova Scotia. He was thrice driven back by storms, a,nd in a third attempt the bark was wrecked. The crew was saved, but the disaster brought to a close French enterprise on the coast of New England.
CAPTAIN GEORGE WEYMOUTH, 1600.

Early in the reign of James I of England, maritime research was active. Two of the patrons of that period were Thomas Arundel, Baron of Wardour, and Henry, Earl of Southampton. They emplo;yed Weymouth and fitted out tor him a vessel with the requiHite pro·isious, and a crew Of twenty-nine men. vVeymouth sailed from England while De Monts was near the Bay of .FmulJ·, and both mwigat,Jrs passell along the eastern coast of America. The first named came within sight of the coast near Cape Cod in the middle of May, 1605, and anchored in what he calls "Pentecost Harbor," because it was entered on "Whitsunday, as stated in Captain Smith~s narratfre, The coast was high and studded with islands, and high mountains were seen in the interior. This Pentecost Harbor is supposed to be the mouth of St. George's Hiver. The island lying· out sea. ward "·eyrnouth named St. George ltiland. There Weymouth planted pease, barley, aml garden seeds, and early in June, 1605, explored Penobscot Bay, which in the same year the Frenchman, De Monts, had examined and named Pentagoet. In the middle of June Weymouth sailed for England.
CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER NEWPORT, 1606.

The expeditions of Gosnold, Pring, Weymouth, Gilbert, and others, were fitted out by separate companies, but these were hy order of the king (James the First) placed under the same Geuera1 Council of GQvernment. He declared that Virginia belonged to England by old and later <lisc<ff· eries, and that explorations had heen extended from the 34th to the 45th parallel of north latitude. By royal order the region was to be regarded as divided between North Virginia and South Virginia, the division line being about midway between tl1e 30th and 40th parallels. The exploratioH and settlement of South Virginia he committed to the Loudon Uornpan:)'; North Yirginia was g.i\-en to the so-called Plymouth Colony, and ample privileges were granted to both. In August, 1606, the London Company sent out a vessel in command of Henry Challons, but he was seized by the Spaniards. At the end·of the 'same year the same company fitted out three ships and provided them with means for a plantation. The expedition was intrustecl to Captain Christopher Newport and sailed from England on the 19th of December, 1606. As usual the course was by way of the West Indies. Southern entrances were at that time regarded as bad harbors,

Captain Smith calls i't "Powhatan River," after the 11oted chieftain, hnt it is probably the same river which was previously known to S1iauianls, aud which they bad marked as "Hio del Espiritu Sau to." fo the middle of June the fort at Jamestown wais complete. Captain Newport left at the :-:ettlement 104 persons and then returned to England. lu thP early e.xperiPuce of the colouists disse1rnionR were frequent, but all matters there e\·entually camp malcr the control of a man of more t11au ordi11ar~· ability, and moreover of adYenturous spirit.
CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH, 1601'.

Smith had sened as an officer Hi the Austrian army, agaiur-t the Turks, and had traveled much abroad. "'hen the two companies were formed for colonization in Virginia, Smith became inter· estcd and accornpauied :S ewport. By the Kiug he was named a8 one of tbe councillors of tlle new colony. 'Yhen the settlement at Jamestowu was deemed secured, Smith led in succession exploring parties toward the iiitHior, mid finally, in the spring of tlw year 1608, made an exploration of the ;;hores of tl1e Chesapeake Bay. .At this time nothing was known respecting either its extent or its direction. \YitlJ an open barge Smith set out from Jamestown on the 2d of J.une, 1608, with 14 pert-ions. II e wa>0 accompanied by 'Valter Rhssell, a physician. Smith, from the mouth of ,James RiveT, crossed the bay and lwgan tlie examination at. Cape Charles. The first islaud on whicl1 they landed was named ''Smith's Isle," arnl from thence he passed along tlie eastern sliorc of the bay, towards the north. The next .group of islands was 11amed "Hussell's Islands.'' These are in 'l'angi(·r Sound. Sailing further he named a group "J,imbo Isles," and a point south of these was marked "Point Ployer." Crossing to the western 8l1ore t11e party examined tl1e Patuxent and the Patapsco, but his men were then tired of hardsliips iu an open barge. Smith was constraiucd to return without having seen the head of the lrn~· or 8{'ttling the qnc·stion whet lier it did or did not lead towards China. On the 16th of .June tl1(',V mitered the Potomac and went up as far as the draught of the boat would allow, probably as high up the stream a8 tl1e site of \Vashington or Georgetown. He then returned, entered the Rappa ha1111ock, antl exploretl it8 eourse. Near by he Fa8 wounded in the hand by a fish, and to mark 1111· ]Jlact· lll' applied tlif' name "Htingray Jsland," wbich holds in tlie vicinity at this day. 011 tlrn ~fat of ,July Smith wa8 again at Jamestown, but ou the 24th set out again along the westem 1>hore of tlw hay and i;:oon reached the head. Be entered the Susquehanna, which he uauH·d aftrr the Snsqneliannocki;:, au Indian tribe settled on it8 shores, and be must have passed well into what is 11ow tlw Sh1te of Pennsylvania, as he marks part of' the river as H Smith's Falls." Another branch of the ba;v he named Tockwough, and it is, probably, Sassafras River. Tlw JJl(iiam; akmg the Chesapeake mentioned to Smith that another great Vllllter e.xisted beyond the l1ills, aud lie jtHlged it to be a lake or river of Canada; but it seems more likely that the Imliarn; referred to Delaware Bay and River. After exploriug thf' principal branches of the Chesapeake, Smith again reached Jamestown on t~e 7th of :September, 1608. He states that the aggregate of water courses. examined was · ahout :3,000 mile8. His map of the 1·egion is creditable in point of accuracy, and was copied many times in the century following his time. He was elected president of the colony aud held office until the autumn of ti){' year 1609. By an accidental explosion of gunpowder he was wounded and felt himself coustrained to return to England. .After his departure no action wss taken in furtherance of his wishes in regard to exploration. He had been previously on the ooast 0£ New Englaud, alld hence his name will be again mentioned in this paper.

The Plymouth Company made an attempt to settle a colony in the year 1GOG, as liad been done by the London Company. In the iuterest of the first-named corn11an;y Captain Thomas Hanharn went to New England and e~plored the havens and harLors, but no details can be found respecting his movements. But, in tlie following ;\·ear, the same company fitted out two ships and sent in them a hundred men under command of Capts. Georg·e Po1Jlrnm and Raleigh Gilbert. They sailed from Plymouth 011 the 31st of May, 1607, and passing westward made land at Monhegan Island on the coast of Maine. Near by, they entered a navigable river uamed Sagadahock and there formed a settlement; but finding the place iuconYenient the~- ruond to Small Point, a few miles west of the mouth of Kennebec Hiver. V\'hen preparatious were corn1ilete for winter the vessels sailed on the 5th of Decern ber for England. The winter proved to be unusuall~' severe aud the settlers <'nffered in consequence of the cold . .Moreover, the India11s were hostile. George Popham and some others died. In tbe spring of 1608 other vesRels arrived with supplies, but the colonists -were alread_y discouraged and concluded to return to England. The death of a brother in England necessitated the departure of Gilbert. In England the returning North Virginian settlers gave unfavorable reports respecting the region and represented that it was uninhabitable for Englishmen.
CAPTAIN SAMUEL ARGALL, 161:>.

Mention has already been made of the coast vosage by ne }fontR in tlw year HiOiJ, a11d of the unfortunate attempt b~· tl1e Sieur du Pont in Hi06. 'l'he I<'rench still reganled themselves as owners of the coast, though of late ,years the English bad visited the region oftener. ln the year 1608 tlrn Fathers Biard and Masse went to Nova Scotia, but soon disagreed with the French governor, and sought another place for settlement. On Mount Desert. Island the~· constructed and fortified a habitation, planted, and passed some ~-ears. Five years later they were joined by tbirt.y of their countrymen, who founded a settlement of the name of Saint Sauveur, wliich was sometimes called Mount J\fausell. But, by the EngHsb this French lodgment was considered an iutmsion on their Virginian possessions. Ca1)tain Argall was therefore sent to displace the intrnders. He had accompanied other commaiHlers, and hence had large experience in coasting. ln the year 1613 he went in charge of a vessel, and was engaged in taking fish when a storm forcC<l him to enter Penobscot Bay. At Mount Desert he found the French settlement of Jesuit missionaries and plundered it, and also seized the only French ship then in the harbpr. :Fifteen Frenchmen were made prisoners and taken t-0 Virginia, and there the fact that any foreign settlement had been made caused much anxiety. The Governor immediately placed three arme1l vessels under command of Argall, and he went north to operate ttgainst the French, ai;; far as Acadia. At Mount Desert he destroyed all vestiges that rema.ined after his hostile vhdt, and st>t up on the island the arms of Great Britain. Passing on to Saint Croix River and the Ha~· of Fundy, all traces of French habitations there and also at Port Royal were scattered. He then returned to Virginia. In English publications and maps what Lad been and is now marked as the Bay of Fundy. was for a long period marked as The Bay of Argall.
CAPTAIN .JOHN SMITH, 1614.

Captain Smith left the CbeRapeake region in tbe year 1609, went to England, and was there He was regarded as a great authority in such matters by leading men of the day. In the year 1612 he published his map of Chesapeake Bay, accompanied by a description of the country, aud thus favored the views and. interests of the London Company. Doubtless the Plymouth Company desired similar ach-antages, as they soon engaged Smith to go out with two ships, in company with Captain Hunt. The vessels sailed promptly and made land at Monhegan Island on the coast.of Mai11e. There the crew was busy taking in a cargo of fish, while Smith with a few hands went in boats along the coast as far south as Cape Cod. Three months were passed in making his survey. He entered nearly every bay and harbor, procured the names of Indian tribes, Tillages, aJ!d localities; observed for longitude and latitude, and after bis return to Englanq (August, 1614) compiled a

He sailed from EuglaJl(l in March, but was captured by French men-of-war and detaint'<l as a priRonn at Rochelle. When liberated, Smith returned to :Euglaud and there pa;,;sell tlie remaiI1<ler of his life in publishing his works. His first narrative and map of New Euglarn1 1rns is:sned iu tl1e year HiHl; alJ(l in token of their regard the members of tlie Plymouth Cololl~· conferrrd on him the hm1urary ti I.le of "Al1miral of .New Rngland." He Ra~-s that he a11plied tlw name (Xe1c England} in opposition to the Frencli, as their" New France'' adjoined, and as, morem·er, the;r included Xorthern Virginia. On the western side of the continent, under tl1e same dPgree of latitude, Sir Francis Drake had landed and uamed a countr.v New Albion. Smith nppliecl mauy new names, but in the course of time they were disused. He says that wlwn coiwtrn<·ting liiR map t<everal others, less accurate, were in his hands. The latitudes assigtH\(l h;,· Smith are good; and the lougitudes are better approximations than were recorded by either of his µredecessors. Captain Thomas Dermer sailed from England in the autumn of the year Hl18 and went westward to Monhegan !Hlarnl. His vessel there tookin fish and furs, and returned to England. Dermer ren·rni11ed ou tfip coast of New Hngland, and iu a small bark passed southward to some part of Virgi11ia in searcl1 of a miue n'ported to he there. He passed into Chesapeake Bay, aud, its he says, "Disconffe<l many .good1~· rivers and exceedingl,Y pleasant a11d fruitful coasts and isllrnds for the o;pace of eighty leagues from west to east, between Hadson River and Cape James, i. Cape Uod.'' Xeither maps nor joumals were left by Dermer. He lef.t only a short letter giving a summar,\· of his Yoyage from the coast of Maine south to Chesapeake Bay. He went southward 011 tile l!ltll of l\Iay, 1G19, touche1l at Plymouth Harbor, passed around Cape Cotl, and staid some time at l\fartlrn's Yine~-ard. In J,ong Island Sound he fQnnd a" dangerous cataract amongst small roeky islands, occasioned by two unequal tides." ThiA mention marks the condition of Hell Gate at that time. He passed througli New l'ork Bay and went south to Uape Charles, where lw anchored and made a map. After his return to the north he wrote a narrative of the voyage, hut nothiug is now kuown re.specting the .details of either the map or the journal. Christopller Levett was i;ent out from .England by authorities claiming the province of .Maine in the ,Year rn~a. He landed at the Isles of Shoals, and from thence coasted in boats to the eastward as far as the Kennebec; but on b~ing told by the Indians that no place in that direction was faYorable for settlements, he returned to bis vessel.

They gave him a small vessel, The 1I al f Moon, and commissioned him to explore the waters uorth of Europe and Asia, to find, if possihlc, a Rlwrt northern passage to the East Indies. He bad been twice employed in such serd1w h,r eertaiu murchauts of London. 111111s011 sailed from Amsterdam on the :!5th of :March, 1609, with a crew of Dutch and Bngfo;h sailors, anu passNl by the north coast of Europe toward A.Asia.

Keeping on Routhwnrd he pa8sed the entrance of Chesapeake Bay, and from the latitude of 350 41' N. he turned back. The dry journal of Juet says nothing in regard to Hudson's intentions.

DA VlD PlETERSZ DE VRIES, 163:!.

De Vries led au expedition to Newfoundland and another to the East Indie8. At his return to Amsterdam in the year 1H31, he formed with Samuel God~·n a11d other Dutch rnercbauts a company for exploring and settling on the Delaware River (then kuown as South River) and for whale fii;hing in that 'icinity. The company sent out a Yessel under Captll!in I'eter Heyes to South Rin~r, and at tlle rnoutlt a small fort was built. But the enterprise was not successful. Ouly one whale was take11, and the garrison of thirty men was unable to resist an Indian attack', and all the defe11ders wert> killed. In the following year De Vries arrived in person with two Yessels. He sailed from tl1e Texel on the 24th of ].\fay, 1632, and reached the entrance of the Delaware on the 3d of December. The vessels anchored near a place which he calls SwauendaPl, aml there a settlerne11t w:1t1 commenced. With one of the vessels the river was examined and names were gi>en to i-everal lotalitit·s, ais, ''Reed Island," "Wyngaert's Bill," "Vogelsaut," "SwaneTidael," "Timmeokill," alld othen;, but these names soon disappeared as later maps were drawn. After taking a few whales De Vrit's made a visit to the English settlenwnt in Virgima, and ou his course explored the low shore of the Delaware peninsula. He returued from Virginia and was again at South Bay on th~ 29th of March. The crew of the vessel left there had, in bis absence

From Hudson River De Vries returned to Amsterdam, and arrived there on tLe 24th of July.

Nothing was thereb~· added to our knowledge of coast hydrograph~·. The development of the eastern coast of the G nitcd States in regard to essential foatures became known iu a short period by the expeditious of French and English to the shores of New Bngland; by Yo.rnges of the Du tell to H utli:;ou Rin~r and Yiciuity; and by the Eug·Jish to Chesapeake Ba;\' and vicinity early iu tl1e seYeuteenth century.

COLUMBUS, 149'2-lf>0'2.

Ou his first arrival iu the western hemisphere Columlms regarded as islands aH the land then );eeu. No chart of that time is extant, except what may be cousidered as such in the armorial hearing~ ordered b;y the King of Spain at the end of May, 1493. Spotorno gives a fac-simile of the map, and Oviedo makes mention of it. He sa~s: "On this ch~ut are seen islands lying iti a gu,lf which is formed hy tierra .firme of the Indies, and upon the tierra firmeof the chart are represented palm trees, other eYergreens, and gold clumps." On his secoud ex11edition Columbus sailed along the south shore of Cuba, and earl.v in June~ 14!14, was at the Isle of Pines, and beyond it be sailed some distance. Strangely, be regarded the regiou as being part of the East Indies, and turned without disco\'ering Mexico. On his fourth voyage (ill Jul~" 1502), Columbmi was again in the westeru part of the Golf, but did not reach Yucatau. He never touched on the mainland of the continent of .America.
SEBASTIAN CABOT, 1497.

The continent was touched on by Cabot on the 24th of .lune, 1497. This was previous to the third vo~-age of Columbus. From his western landfall he passed along the coast southward, but the limit reached in that direction is somewhat uncertain. The ouly early chart marked with the discoYeries of Cabot is that of Juan deCosa, of the year 1500, referred to by Humboldt and Walk· enaer. Un it Cuba is represented ae an island, and the con1inental shore line rmH!I to tbe north and to the west of Cuba.

JUAN DIAZ DE SOLIS AND VINCENTE YAREZ PINZON, 150ti.

In 1494 <Jolumbus had intimated tbat no passage WlHl practicable around the coast of Cuba, a111l his declaration seems to have checked somewbat the progress of discovery in that regiou. The eftect was to divert attention to the southward and westward, and thus the outline of the Carihhean Sea became known while the north and west shore of thr Gult of Mexico was ~-et unexplored. Solis and Pinzon sailed from Hispaniola and reached the coast of Honduras. Fernando Columbus sa~·s the.r had a pilot, Pedro de Ledeimia, who had been in the same regiou with Christopher Columbm;. They sailed along the cost of Honduras and ~tee1·ed northward, but the limit of their navigation cannot be marked with certainty. In the biography of his father, Fernando Uolumbu" says that Solis an~ Pinzon made a chart of the newly discovered regions, but no copy of 1<uch chart is known to us.
SEBASTIAN DE OCAMPO, 1508.

Herrera sa.ys (in 1507) that King .Ferdinand of Spain regarded his officers as deli1niue111, because so mauy years had elapsed without settling the question as to the insular charaeter of Cuh:i. He therefore sent an order to his Governor-General of the vYest Indies, Don Nicolas de Ornu<lo, to fit out an expedition. Two ves8els were sent under Captain Sebastian de Ocampo, who had bee11 with Columbus in Yoyages to Hispaniola. The navigation was difficult, and the vessels needing· repairs, a port was entered on the northwestern coast of (Juba, and there some time was passed in refitting. The iilace he designated as Puerto de Carenns [harllor of careening], but it is uot doubtful that the port was Havana. Ocampo sailed along the south coast of Cuha, goiug eastward. Near the Isle of Pines be crossed the track followed by Columlms in 1494, and returned to Hispaniola after being eight months at sea. TJ:iere is no complete ~nrnal nor record of nautical and astronomical observations made by Ocampo, but he wa~ certainly the first man who dfacovem1l the. prospective importance of the harbor of Havana. In the year 1512 Diego VeJasquez marched in the int~ior of Cnba, and Ponce de 1.eou, !'<ailing· from Porto Rico;traveri;ed part of the shores of that great island. In the year following, a map was printed in Europe, showing to the northwest of Cuba a gulf and a peninsula, and it was probably an attempt to represent Florida and the Gulf of :Mexico. The map is given in the Strasburg edition of Ptolemaeus, of the _year 1513. On it is depicted to the northwest of Cuba a continent marked with the name Parias, which designation was somewhat common on earl_y maps of the American continent. The author of the map here especially referred to was John Sclwtt. At that time such publications were suppressPd in Spain. 'The map has no reference to Ponce de Leon, nor is it marked with the name Florida, nor with any other, pertaining to his adventures. He regarded Florida as an island, aud it is so represented on the map. On a chart of the year 1508 Ouba is marked as an unfinished discovery, showing onlr part of the northern and part of the southern shore, and it bears the inscription, ''So far came the sllipH of King Ferdinand of Spain." Rvidently the parts shown were such as had been seen by Columbus. Rnisch, the compiler of the map, knew nothing of the map of Cosa, which was made in the year 1500. Near the end of the year 1510, or possibly some months later, a vessel went from Hispaniola for the capture of Indians. Thirty men were ou board. By a storm the vessel was forced into the Gulf of Florida, and was wrecked. All the crew were killed by the uath-es, excepting two women and one man, who were given tts slaves to a cacique of the Indian district near HaYana. There the captives lived uutil liberated at the time of tbe conquest of the island of Cuba, by Diego Velasquez. The port in which the misfortune happened, was afterwards called Puerto de Ma.tanzas [port of slaughter], and it still bears the name. Velasquez landed in 1511 aud reached.the middle parts of the island in about two ~'ears. He learned that Spaniards weie held by the Indil:ms, and hastened to liberate them. The survirnr assured Velasquez that he had been held nearly four years. In the year 1511 a. vessel was de!j!patched from the Isthmus of Darien, commanded by Captain Valdivia., to bring a sum of gold, and to report the state of affairs to the Governor-General. Unfortu.nat.ely this vessel was wrecked on some rooks on· the south t1ide of Jamaica. ValdiYia and

i;omc of the crew in a boat attempted to reach the coast of Cuba, but were swept westward b~· the currents, and lauded in Yucatau.

PO~CE

DE LEON.

1512.

The IndiauR fouud on Cuba had a tradition of a country to the northward named " Oautio,'' where was a. river of which tl1e waters would restore youth. As Ocampo passed eight montl1s of the year 1508 in that vicinity it seems probable that his report was known to P.pnce de Leon, who, for Ronie tinw, was goyer110r of the island of Porto Rico. But a similar story was told of a fountain ou au isl a ml called "Rim.ini," to the northwest of Hispaniola. Three years later the governor was snpe1se<led, !Jut he had IJpcorue wealthy, and fitted out at bis own co:st three Tessels, and with them sailed OH the 3d of March of tbe year 1512 from Aguada, at the month of the river Guanabo. In the middle of the montl1 he was at Guanahani, where Columbus had landed. He crosRed the track of Columbus and advanced to the northwest. On the 27th of March, which was a festfral day, called by the Spaniards "el Dia de Pascua Florida de Resurreccion," he saw the coast of a new country, which he regarded as an island, and this he named "La Florida" He coasted some distance, but firnling no harbor turned back, as the current was strong. With some difficulty he rounded Cape. Canaveral, and going southward reached the Florida reefs and keys. On the weistern coast of the peninsula, at a place which cannot readily be identified, the wssels remained until the 3d of June. Next day they w~re attacked by a great fleet of canoes. l\fony Indians and a few of the Spaniards were kiJled, hence the place was named Isla de l\fatanza; i. e., the island of slaug'hter. For some days, however, intercourse was maintained with the natives. l'assing on westward, they reached the Tortugas on the 21st of June, and there they caught. in a single night one hundred and sixty large turtle8. They killed also seals, pelicans, and other birds which there abounded. Three days afterwards they sailed, and agatn saw land on the 2Gtl1. At thP end of the month they entered a harbor to repair the :vessels, but could learn nothing of the country to which it pertained. By most of the party it was believed to be part of Cuba, as some iron tools were seen, and trees that bad been cut by knives. Moreover the trend of the coa8t was east and west. Ou l'riday, tlie 1st of July, they left the harbor and brought up at some islands of the ],uca~·an group. There the;y sought for tlie island of Bimini, and met with a Spanish vessel commanded b~· Diego Mirnelo, who was sailing on his own account. Mucl1 was expected from lli:s cxperieuce as a }Jilot in that dangerous quarter, but the vessel in which he had joined the lleet of Ponce WlilS soon wrecked in a storm, but without loss of life. The family to which l\1iruelo belouged afterwards became famous as .Gulf pilots. 1~011ce decided to sail homeward, but· before starting despatched a vessel to renew the search for Bimini. This was commanded b;y Juan Perez de Ortubia and the pilot, Antonio de Alamin0s. l~imini was found, but nothing was seen of the wonderful fountain. The place was, however, reported to he a cheerful, fresh-looking island, well watered, and full of trees. Herrera adds to his rt·port on tlti:s expedition a chapter on the nature and currents of the Gulf Stream, but as the journals of l'oBce de Leou were not extant, th·e conclusions in regard to that marine feature are doubtle:ss tinch ai,; occurrrd to Herrera a, century after the time of Ponce de Leon. He probably drew a chart sllowiug the contour of the Florida peninsula, and it seems Jikely that.the sketch giveu by Diego lHhero, in the year 1529, was reduced from the charts of PonM.

Shortly after the time of Ponce de Leon the gulf shore of Cuba was settled by Spaniards. In the ;rear 1511 Don Diego Oolon, then Governor-General of the West Indies, resolved upon the eon. quest of the great island, of whicp. nothing was known to E11ropeans except that ft wu a good

UOHDOVA.

Francisco Hernandez de Cordoya was a wealth;.· settler of Cuba, who held Imlia11s and also au estate near tile town of Espiritu Santo, near the middle of Cuba. He was elected a;; com1mtndcrin-chief by upwards of a hundred enterprisiug young Spaniards, \rl10 desired to make disco\'('ries. All of them had come to Cuba from Dariell, where the GoYernor, Pedro .Arim; fif' A_yila, had not found sufficient occupation for them. But in Cuba they were too late. Yelascpiez hnd already completed the conquest aud partition of the island. Cordon1, howeYer, accepted the offer of these men who wished to gain wealth or reputation. He fitted out two vpssels, and the thir(l wa8 given by the Governor under the condition that they should bring to him a number of Indian slaws from the islands of the Guanajos. Tl1.e offoT was declined b,\- CordoYa, who explained that thc;r were conoorned only in exploration and. discovery. Velas<1uez then gaTe them the ship on their own conditions. Their chief pilot was Ant-011io de Alamiuos, and the vessel sailed 011 the 8th of February, in the year 1511t, from Havana. Going westward tlrn party doubled Cape. Sau Antonio after coa8ting twelve days, and then stretched into the sea westward, without knowkdge of rocks, shoals, currents, or winds that might be encountered. It iR not mentioned that theJ· had 011 board a copy of the chart of Columbus made iu 1502, nor of Solis and Piuzon's chart of lti06. The only inducement to take a western direction seems to have ttuned on the recollections of their chief pilot, Alaminos, who remembere<l that Columbus, with whom he bad sailed as a boy, had alwa,ys a strong inclination to go westward. After' a heav,v storm, which lasted two days arnl ·nights, the course was changed, and twenty-one days aft-Or their departure from Guba they came i11 sight of land. }'rom the sliip, they saw a large Indian town, and when they came to anchor, 011 the 4th of March, many canoes came out to them, and some were of size sufficient to contain fifty Indian.'I. These, in their intercourse with the Spaniards, frequent!;.· repeated the words "Con escotoch" ! and hence on the chart the place was marked "Punta <le Cotoche." The Indian words were probably intended to express an invit.ation to come ashore. .After a short land excursion to the interior, the Spaniards had a bloody encounter with the Indians, but at the same time found t-0 their great joy good buildings and temples, a11d in them idols and ornaments of gold. Thus stimulated, they held along the shore to the west, and discovered points, bays, and many of the shoals and reefs of that part of Yucatan. The pilot, AJaminos, however, believed that the newly.found country was an island, a susgestion as will be

On the 25th of March th1>,y rt·achcd a bay, which the Indians called "Quimpech," hut in the Spanish pronunciation it is known to this day as Oampeche. The natives hailed the atlYenturers repeatedly with the word " Omitila11,'' at tlrn 1mme time J10inting towanl the east. While taking in water from shore the Hpauianls saw temples omamented like those at Catoche, but tliese could uot ue examined, ai; the natiYes collected iu great numbers and marched in battle array. The Spaniards retreated, bnt hrought off their water caRks, and after stowiug them sailed away to tlie southwest without in terrnptiuu, fayo1·ed durillg six <l::tys by wind and weather. Ou the seventh day a heM'Y north wiud caused the casks to leak, and made it needful to seek another anchorage. They consequently wellt into the mouth of a river 11ear an Indian Yillage, the uame of which was Pononch3u. Here thej· found wat(·r wellf·, buildiugs of stone, maize plantations, and other signs of a good state of cultivation; but trusting- too far inland the,y were attacked by uatives in overwhelming numbers, aud like those of Campecbe, the Iudians uttered the cry, "Castilan," "Castilan.'' In cutting their way through the mass of sa,'ages the Spaniards lust fifty-seYen men in killed and two others were carriPo away as prisoners. The boats were capsized, the water casks lost, and all who reached the ships wpre markf!d by wounds. The commander, Cordova, was wounded in twelve places. Thi8 sad e\·ent euded further progress, aud the place was named by the pilot and mariners of the expedition "Bahia de la ruala pelea," i.e., Bay of the disastrous fight. It was probably the mouth of tla· rin·r now kuowu as the Champotou. The lesst>11ed force beiug insufficient to work three shi11s, one of the vessels was burnt, and tlw party resohed to return to Cuba. They suffered for want of fresh water, and consulted the d1:1rts. Alarniuos judged it best to leave the direct course aml h.r turning northward to make the coast of Florida, all(] then fall back to find tile harbor of Havaua. Only this general fact is known. That commander had, when with Ponce de Leon, crossed the Gulf of Florida twice, and he bad 8ailecl al8o with Ortnbia amongst the Yucatan Islands. It is probable that, with Ocampo, he passed cutirely around the coast of Cu ha. Hence his opportunity was ample for making observations on the U8nal eastcm direction of the winds which blow into and along the eastern gate of the Mexican G n lf. The n'issels lwd a short time before suffered by a beiwy northeast gale. The expedition was prnlialil.r saYed from furtlier disaster by adopting the proposal of Alamiuos. Going north all(\ northeast t11e party came in sight of the coast of Florida. He landed with some men, and rP<'ognized the n·gion whicl1 he had seen in 1512. By digging well8 good water was found, but tlie~· were attackl'd h;r Indiarns wbile so emplo:yed. In passing to Hii\'ana (by the Florida Keys) t111·~· had oul;y 4 fathpms of wat~r, and the largest Yessel struck agai11st rocks, but the exhausted crews at lai;t readied Havana. The wounded cllptain, Cordova, retired to his plantat.ion near Santo Spiritu, aml tl1ere died. Some of his officers and men presen_ted themselves to the Governor (Velasquez) and reported fayorahl:r of the new country. Some of the products were shown, and two of thl· i11liabitants who bad been taken as prisoners. ·
GRIJALVA AND ALAMINOS. 15l8.

Hepurts iu regard to Yucatan led to the fitting out of four ships, which were provided with a forn· of two l1urnlrcd and t\Yenty men. Juan de. GrijalYa, a cousin of the Governor, and a man. of e1H·rgy uud prnd<'H<'<", was at the bead of the fleet as Captain-General. Pedro de Alvarado, Fraucisco de 1\lontejo, aml Alonzo de A Yila, all of whom afterwards became famouR as companionfl'I of C1>rtes, wnc assigned to the command of vessels; and some of the· soldiers and sailors who had been wit b Cordovajoi11ed the exi)edition. Amongst others was the chief pilot, Antonio de Alaminos, aml Bernal Diaz de! Uai;tilla. 'I'he instructio111;; gh·en hy Yelasquez to the commander of this expedition are not extant, but in the iustructionl>' of the same Velasquez, addressed to Cortes in the year 1518, the Governor says that lie sent out Grijalva priucipally for the purpose "of examining and circumnavigating the island of Yucatan aml to discoYer further onward." The harbor of Matanzas, on the coast of Cuba, was indicated as the general rendezvons for ofticers, men, and ships, and from that place the fleet !'ailed on the 5th of April, 1518. Following the track of CordoTa's expedition, <Jape San Antonio was sighted in eight days, and from thence,

after sailing ten days, tbey reached the coast of Yucatan. By the currents tlwy were carried southward and first saw the island of Cozumel, to the south of Cape Catoclie, 011 the 3d of l\lay. To Cozumel was then given the name "lBla de Sauta Cruz." They followed the tr~wk of Cordon1 to Obampoton, and there bad a fierce battle, but tlie saYages of Yucatan wert> irnt to tlight. Coasting farther they sonn saw an opening which was considered to he the mouth of a large riYer. but, on entering, it was found to be a large lagoon. As late as the :year lti50 charts were drawl! ou the authority of Alaminos tha1 show Yucatan as an island; am1 this was long after the pilots and men of Grijalva had found out tlwir mistake. From the lagoon last mentio11ed the partr sailed very cautiously along· the uukuown coai:;t, moving only by daylight. On the 7th of June they saw the mouth of a great riYer, which wali entered by the two smaller vessels and by all the boats. The two larger vessels remained at ancllor outside. H~re tbe Indians assmbled in thousands, but there was 110 hostile demonstration. Prese11ts were interchanged. Amongst the Indians were some trinkets of gold: and the occasio11 was further remarkable, as then for the first time the uame ''Mexico" was pronounced in tbt> hearing of Spaniards. When the nati>es were asked where such gold could he found tliey pointed towards tbe risiug iom1 aud pronounced the name" Mexico." The Spaniards quickly embarked for tbe search, but the river, wbicl1 thPy named Rio GrijalYa, was long aftn bis time known al:i Rio Tabasco, as bearing the uame of the cMique of the region. An active period followed in which riYer mouths and other entrances were first knowu to Europeans. The Rio de las Bauderas became famous because Spaniards there found ;;ul~jectH of the Indian Emperor Montezuma, and possessed them Rel Yes of a considPra ble quantity of goltlen curiosities. In excbauge for a few cbeap European trinkets a.nd blue beadr:.; they gained the sum of J.5,000 pesos. The next place vi;;ited was tlJat which became fhe reuowned port of Juan de Ulloa. This came into view on tbe 18th of June, and tliern some poor Indians na(l been Hacriti.cc·d to the p~an deities. Hence the place was named lsfa de Sacrificios. The islan<l and its name stands on every old chart of' the Mexican Gulf. At another place on the beach the Spaniards built huts and remained several days expioring tbe vicinity. On a neighboring islaml t.'Yi<lences appeared of the sacrifice of human beings. These were viewed by Grijalrn with horror, and by au interpreter he asked what bad caused these abominations. The answer was, "01na"! "'--Hua"! Bence the name of the }Jlace was marked on the chart as ''Ulloa.'~ This happe1w(l on thC' day of St. John, and therefore addition was made to the Jmlian ap1w1latio11; the place was known a;; San Juan de Ulloa. The region adjoiuing was named Saint Mary of tbe Snow. Grijalva rt>soh-ed to send a message to Velasquez b,y Pedro de Alvarado in the ship San Sebastian; and moreover his party needed provisions. All the gold then gathered was sent, aud also written reporti-; from the several officers. After Alvarado's departure (on the 24th of June) Grijalva aml bi:" men sta.rted with the remaining vessels and passed along the coast iu hope of further disccfferie::;. \"\ itl1 the mountains of Mexico constantly i.11 Yiew, they at last came to a river, "Rio de Canoa8," in the province of Panuco. Many Indian canoes made out boldly and commenced battle, but with littlP effect, against the Spauisb ships. Proceedilig farther, a great cape was seen, but conld not he passed, as the curreuts were strong. The pilot, Alaminos, advised agaiust sailiug farther to tl1t> north. It was found, moreornr, that provisions were scarce, and that 80me of the ships leaked bailly. As winter was approaching the commander decided to return to Cuba. On Hie 2Hth of Septemhel' that island was sighted 1 and on tbe 9tb of October they entered the l)Ort of Matanzas, from wliicu they had sailed six months earlier. On the resulting charts an important part of the gulf wa>s represented, and on them appear the names "Mexico," "New Spain/' "Terminost "lJlloa," and numerous other designations that are yet retained. From Ulloa a veMrsel was sent by Grijalva under command of Pedro Alvarado wHh ortleni to examine the coast of Cµba. The rnssel arrived in Mafet:r, but no details are known reli11ectiug· the observations then made. So also of the· voyage of CbristoYal de Olid, whom Yelasquez sent from Cuba to follow the track of Cordova and Grijalva. Olid reached tlie shores of Yucatan, hut by heavy gales was forood to rnturn without meeting Grijalva or seeing much of the hitherto unknown coast. Olid was su.bsequently sent by Cortes to Yucatan and the Ba,y of Honduras. On his arrival at Cuba, Grijalva found that much interest had been excited by the discoveries of .Alvarado. The' Governor, Velasquez, bad fitted out another armament, and, although Grijalva

had been energetic, the governor was not coutent, as tliat commander bad not settled and fortified a place in the new couutr,y wlticli was snpposed to be rich. 'Ihe corumauder was not again employed, mill soon after weut to Jamaica, entered into the sen·ice of Garay, and accompanied him in his expedition to Panuco in 1523. Grijalva was killed in a revolt of the Indians in Nicaragua, where be had joined the standard of l 'edriarias.
FERNANDO CORTES, 15Hl.

The voyages all(l operationR of Cortes are described in the letter which he addressed to the King of Spain from Vera Cruz early iu August, 1519. The letter is not extant, but fortunately the chaplain, Go111ara, giYes an extract in the fortieth chapter of his Cronica de la Nneva Espaila; and there are other sonrceH of information touching the ad venture. Velasquez instructed CorteR to go nrst to Cozumel lslaml, :rnd from thence to Yucatau. I:!e was to sound and examine all tLe ports, inlet;;, aud watering places, including those of Mexico, aud afterwards giYe a complete nautical account. Bnt the uames ".Mexico" and "New Spain;' are I1ot mentioned in that tlocument. Tlie armament consisted of eleven ,·essels, which carried five lnmdred soldiers and officers, ancl tl1e account says more tbau a lturnlred pilots and sailors. Nearly all tLc vessels of Grijalva and his principal officer8 accompanied, but the connuander was excluded. As in the preceding expedition8, Antonio Alaminos went as chief pilot. :Morillo, an Indian captured by Grijah·a at the promontor;y of Catoche, aud who had been baptized and taught Spanish, was the interpreter for Yucatan. Havana was the place of rendezvous. Pedro de Akarado was sent in advance,'ancl the other vessels sailed from Havana on the 10th of Februar;y, 1519, and had a short passage to Yucatan and the hiland of Cozumel. There Cortes questioned the men of Grijalva respecting the word "Castilan" whicL the Iudiaus of Yucatan had so ofteu prouonuced, aud he concluded that Home Spauianls were in tLe vicinity. On further inquiry these pro\'ed to he men wh<Aurvivell the shipwreck of Hierouimo de Aguilar. On the 5th of March the fleet doubled Cape Catoche, and soon after a vessel commanded by Escobar was sent to examine the Bay of Terminus and select a site for establishing a colony. Uouhtless his report was unfavorable, as when he rejoined the fieet Cortes sailed immediately for Uw Tabasco Hiver, and reached the entrance in seYen days. It is thus made plain that no sonud in gs were recorded, nor nautical examinations of any otl1er kind. Bis intention was to settle and fortify. Some severe battles occurred witb the Indians of Tabasco Hiver. He accepted their peace offerings and again listened to stories of the country "Mexico." On Holy Thursday the tleet came to anchor at San J nan de Ulloa, and there i;ome Indiai1 messengerR approached in canoes and told Cortes of the great sovereign of the iuterior, .Montezuma. Two vessels were pn·p:u(·d and seut 1101thward under command of I1'rancisco de Montejo. These were piloted by Alamiuos. Tlie vessels followed the track of Grijalva, but went beyond ltis limit, which was Cape Hoxo. Montejo and Alami11os doubled that cape and iliscoYered the Rio Grande de Panuco, at the moutb of which they arrived only a few days earlier than another Spanish 11avigator who had reached that quarter from the north. Strong contrary cunents withstood Montejo and Alaminos, and a heavy "norther" threatened them with destruction. But the north wind forced them back to Ulloa, after an absence of twelve days. The only anchorage which Alaminos deemed safe against strong north wiuds was some distance to the northward of Ulloa, and to that place the arm~, was tra.nsforred and the colony was founded. Cortes named it Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz, i. e., the rich town of the true cross. The latter designation implied that they had landed on Holy Friday; awl the worcl '' rica" was added because gold was obtained. The name bas import similar to that of tbe "Golden Gate," as applied to the entrance of San Francisco Bay. Cortes fortified the place and dispatched to the King of Spain a vessel with presents and re_ ports of bis operations. He then dcstro;ycd his fleet and marched early in August, 1519, for the conquest of Mexico. Cortes confided bis dispatches and presents to Puerto Carnero and Montqjo, two of his officers, and placed them on a vessel, of which Antonio Alaminos was chief pilot. Bemal Diaz says that the best sailing vessel of the squadron was chosen. Henoo it was 1>robably the "S. ~tiant"

Only Olle vessel had beell sent direct)~- over, aud that carried intelligence of Urijaka's success, but the pa,i.;sage wa8 tHade throng·h tl1e Windward Islauos. Almninos, who had beeu with Ponce de Leon in the _year 1512, and wit Ii Cor<lont iu 151 i, pro. posed to sail between Florida and Uuba, to the east and north. Corte;; adopted the plan, and hfa mPssengers, muler the command of .Alaminos, sailed from Vera Cruz on the 2nth of .T nly, mm; crossed the Onlf of Mexico, and pasAing- eastward entered t11e St.rait of Florida; and tlie \'e;;sel which carried him arrived at San Lncar, in Sp11i11, early i11 October. It wonld he needlet's to speculate on the route taken, and whether or not the Gulf Stream fin·ored the paRsage. We J;:uow, however, with certainty tbat in going dfrectly eastward 11e came iu sight of the Azores, and no navigator is on record for the sarne latitude predous to the year 151!). 'l'o Alaminm; is douhtleR>; due the adva.utage of passing from the West Indies to Europe hy keeping in· the Gulf Strt·aw. The Bermmlas were soou after discovered aud a plau for their settlement was fixed iu the year li"i2i. A1aminos ueYer returned to the Gulf shores. Ile weut to t:3pain witl1 the father of I·'ernando Cortes, and report.ell llis own discoveries and those of Cortes, Grijaka, and Cordova. He waR c(irtai11ly the most intelligent and energetic of the Meximrn flulf pilots. He was with Uolnmuns iu 1502-'0:J in the waters of tlw \-Vest IndiPs ancl toward;; Y11catm1.

It seems that Alamiuos regarded this ::is the limit of GrijalYa's discoveries. Garay therefore fitted out four Ycsscls while Velasquez was preparing his armament for Cortes. The command was given to Dou Alouzo Alvarez Pineda, who sailed from Jamaica to thP northwest early iu tlw year 1519; probably about U.1e time when Cortes sailed from H<waua. Piueda, following the sa1liug directions of .A.lamiuos, sailed from Jamaica early in the J car, a11<l coasted aloug t11e west side of Florida Peninsula iu ltope of finding some passage. Piuding none, he held on westward and entered the ri,·er Pa.nuco, whNe Montejo had beeu a few months earlier. Ile next visited the lrnrbor at which Cortes h.ad built his fortress of Villa l{ica de la Vera Cruz, ancl from which Cortes had only a few ditJS prm·ious departed with I.is army for the conquest of Mexico.

Tl1e proceedi11gs of Cortes in New Spain were mgarde<l by Velasqnez as relwllious.

Francisco de Uaray, Goveruor of Jamaica, sent a second expedition into the Gulf in the spring of the year 1.520. His men, under Piimda, found nothing attractiYe on the uorth shore of the Gulf; hut near the rfrcr Panuco they saw the fine region now known as the province of Tamanlipas.

That commander, with the co-operation of Montezuma, had sent messengers to Pannco and obtained tribute in token of the submissiou of the Indian chiefs. Garay eornmitterl the enterprise to Alonzo Alvarez Pineda, and as second in commarnl Diego Uamnq;~o, and gave them three vessels, one hundred and fifty men, and the materials requisite for lmiltli11g a town :md fortification. At Pannco, a settlement was hegun, but probably at the investigation of Cortes the [ndhtns attacked the settlers. In the constrained embarkation one of tlw \'P.-:sPls wm; wrecked. Pineda was killed.

FRANCISCO DE GARAI, lti23.

Of two expeditiom; Rent to tlrn Gnlf by Garai, tl1c second ('Ilded in total loRs. Hut rPgartli11g· 11is large ontlay, the King issued a decree granti11g l1im the government of the proYiuce of Arnichd with s11d1 rights as were then usual. But no mention was matle of the limit,;; nor of the bou11dary li1w of tile province. Ohristo,·al de Tapia was to be sent out as a special commissioner to confer in what related to Cortes, but he returned to Spain in 1.)22 and bad not settled anytlling·. Cortes went forward with Yigor in plans for conquest. Ile marclied with an ar111y from ::vrexicoto Pa1111co mul found<"<l at thr montl1 of the rfrer a colony callt'<l "San B>itcran !lei J'uf'rto.'' (iarai 111ea11whilc wasvrepining an armament for tlw Sallie n·gion. He titted out l'len·u \"essel,.; aml all army of nearly l,(100 meu, and thus exhausted his own private meam;. The pilot of tlle 11eet was Diego Miruelo, a nephew of the Diego Miruelo who was in Ren·ice with Ponce de Leon. After a tklay of two ~·ears tlic fleet sailed 011 the 26th of June, 1524. ·what Cortes had done was made known at a harbor in Cnha where the fleet touclle<l, hut the ve1-;sdx 11cvertlieless kept on, and reacllecl the shore of Mexico uear the mouth of the Hio de !all .Palmas. On all old Spanish charts that riYcr is marked as at some distance to the north of Pauuco; sometimes ou the 25th aml sometimes 011 the 24th parallel. The river is marked 011 a chart of lfi20, which doubtless Cortes copied from Pineda's chart. It is the river now knowu as thP 8antander. Garni seut a n·ssel into the river and it wa,.; explored to a distauee of 15 leagu<·s. The11 !Ji~ flcwt was ;;e11t under comnmnd of Juan Le Grijalva to sail southwanl while lw marched wit It tlw army in tlw same direction. At Panuco it was his inteutiou to fou11d a city to be uamcd "Garayana;" but. the mareh was through a desert. Tlrn army arrfred iu distress on the border,,; of 1\1 exico, a1Hl tlie soltfa~rs of Corks were neither provide<.} nor ineli11ed to reccfre so mauy guests. I<'orag-i11g: 11arties were sent out. Of the fleet, six vessels Wt>re lost and the others were damaged. Ouly a sllort time before tlle arrival of Gitrai the royal decree was received in whicli Garai was pt>reu1ptorily forbidden to lan<l at Pannco, as that province was regarded as helongiug to M1;xico. Cortes promptly sent a copy am1 Garai recognized that Im had erred. He r<isolved to !'<~tire witb hi,.; lli·et a11d army to the 1:01tll .au<l make a settlement at the ltio de Palmas. Orders were g·in·u to that effect, but his soldiers were reluctant and dedared an i11cli1mtio11 to ;;tay where they were. Garai concluded to joi11 Uortes. He went to Mexico and wall well receiYed, hut hrnke1d1eart:ed aud poor he. died soon after his arrival iu the house occupied by Cortes. He made that em11111aml1·r the executor of his will; a11d one of bis sons wall betrothed to a uatnml daughter of Col't(·s. After the death of Garai it may be said that. tlw empire of )foute.zunm wa;; wholly H11hjc·d lo ()urtes, aml he ext.muled hi:; view:-; t-0 more tlistaut regious. B1-. tittrnl out n·sr;elr; 011 tlll' coast of the Pacitlc Ocean, aml also sent vessels to Central .\111erica, nndpr Uhristontl de Olid. AnothPr armament was destined for adventures on the northl·m shores. In Iii;; fourth letter to tl1l' E11111eror Uortes remarks that "nothing seems to remain but to explore the cmrnt. lyiug l1etwl'e11 tlH· ri\·pr Pannco aud .Florida, the latter heing tbe couutr,Y discm·er('d lis the Addantado ,luau 1'011<··· dc: Leou, and the northern coast of I<'lorida as far a;; Baccalaos, becanRe it is co11sidered, certai11 that there is a strait which leads into the South Sea." The delusion coutinued, a11d tweut.) years after the time of Columbus ma.ny hoped to find a strait; if not between Florida and New Spain, it was thought that tbe strait might exist north of Flori~.

Cortes bad destined three caravels and two brigantines, aud his direction was that, they should adYauce as far uortu a8 the Baccalaos, i. t:., to :Newfouuc:lland. But soon after lie was informe1l of the n'Yoll of his captain, ()}id, in Honduras, aud frlt obliged to march south. :MoreoY·H, (fo1turba11cei'i i11 Mexico claimed attention in the year 1526 and 1527; and then tbe exploration and go\'emment liad passed i11to othPr han<lA. B~· Cortes, more than any other adventurer, the Gulf of Mexico hecame k11owu in F~urope; and it was soo11 tlle center of flourishing commerce. But he made 110 geueral chart; auil that fact is the more singular because he organized his plans for conquest b~· mea1m of a sketch drawn at his request by Montezuma.
NARVAEZ, 1527-153fi.

Dou Luis Pouce de Leou, on whom the title of Governor of Florida ha<l devolved from his father, remained iuacti\'C; ltllll this seems to be true ahm of the son of Garai, to whom a daughter of Uortrn,; had been betrothed. Cortes had promised protection, but the spirit of adventure fou11d place only iu l'amfilo de Narvaez, who had been prl'viously engag(·d i11 explorntions on the Gulf coast. He lnul beeu with Velasquez to Culm; had carried a fleet to Mexico; and ha<l been unfortunate i11 au cxpeclitiou against Cortes, who took him prisoner, but, at tlrn request of Garai, liberated him a11tl gave liim means to return to Un ha an fl to Spain. He was rich, and ottered his scrviees for the conquc,,;t of the uorth parts of the Gulf, autl in the ;vear 1526 made with the Govermnent a treaty 8ig-11i(ying that he should be allowed to assemble a naval and military force, and witil it discover aml posseHs all eonutries north of the H.io de las Palmas on the frontier of ~c~'" ~11ui11 to Flol'idn, an1l thnt he Hl1ould fouud a 15cttlement fro111 one sea to the otht'r, aud report 011 all that wa1S \\'Ortliy of ret:onl. The co111111issiou was ample, as it co111prisetl t!Je settleu1..,ut of our presl'nt 8outhern 8tates, with a shore hue of more thau l,'..!00 nantice\l miles. If Narvaez had fulfilled his eom11lissiuu, Cortes would have been confronted h.r a powerful ri\'al. At tile i'iarnf> time a commission waH given to Francisco Montejo as Govemor of Yucatan, aud to Pedro Al nnado as Govemor or Guatemala. 'l'ilese may be rPgarde<l as iuten<led to check the i11fluence of Uortes. Ile bad treated Narvaez generously after his defeat, but tliey coultl not be regarded as friends. The go,·ernment included in the boundaries was named ''El Govierno del Rio de las Palmas," and it was expressly saic:l that in this government shoulc:l be included all that was called Florida. Narvaez was made .Adelantad() and Captain-Ge1wml. Amongst other oftkers appoiuted by the King was the treasurer of the t'xpediti()n, Cabei;a de Vaca. Narrnez sailed from San Lucas, in Spain, on the 17th of June, 1527, with five vessels anc:l six hunc:lred men. After crossing the Atlantic he touched at Saiiat Domingo, and there one hundred aud fifty of his men escaped. Near Cuba the fleet suffored by a hurricane, but at that island he p:.i!<sed the winter. With the assistauce of oue of the most wealthy and geuemus of the proprietorn (Varco J>orcallo), he collected there a store of provisious and eugagt'd other ships aud men, and also the chief pilot, Diego Miruelo, who deserves particular mention, as he had accompanied G<trni on Li8 expedition to Rio de las Palmas. Ile was, moreover, a nepllew of the Diego l\firuelo who wa8 with Ponce de Leou atlc:l afterwards with Lucas cle Ayllon. Uabei;'a de Vaca and llerrera recorll him as au expPrieucetl pilot of the Rio de las Palmas and of the north coast, but it seems unlikely that :\Iiruelo could gaiu much experience with Garai in the year 1523. Mort' probably he was with l'ineda, iu the ~'ear 1519 1 around the uorth line of the Gulf coast. In March, 1528, Nar\'aez sailed from the south coast of Cuba, doubled Cape San Antonio in bail weather, and sailt~<l towards Hanmn, but hecause of very stormy weather he was unable to enter that port. He was nl'ar the coast of Florida early in April, and on the 13th of that month ancLored iu a ba,Y, whicl1 was fouml to be exteush'e. This was doubtless Tampa Bay. In the huts of the Iudiarns who lived 011 the sliore were found such boxes as the Spaaisli mercilants then used for their goods; and they were likely the remains of some wreck. Pieces of cloth were also found like the stuft' used iu .New Spain. The uati ves said that these articles were from '' Apalacbo,'' and that Ruch goods were plenty there, as also gold. That place was sought, and it 1:1eemed be1:1t to send the soldiers and horses to go on laud while the floot kept near the shore to find a harbor. The army moved on the 1st of May, leaving the fleet under command of Carvallo, with direction t-0

Before Narvaez set out from Tampa Ba;r to the iuterior, the pilot, :l\fir1wlo, was s1·11t, as already stated, to look for a harbor; bnt three of the ships were left at Tampa, under Can'allo, witl1 instructions to go Uil along tbe coast and to join the other rnssels. ~Iiruelo, uot 1i11<li11g liis supposed harbor, turned back in accordance witl1 his iimtructiom; nod :sailed to Cuba, and from thence <lispatcl1ecl a vessel with proYisions to Tampa Bay. ·Oarntllo, with tlrn remai11i11g three shiJ)S and a hundred men, sailell north, but finding JJO harbor turned back and joined l\1irnPlo at Tampa Bay.

The daugerons rrnYigation of the Gulf of F'lorida was the occasion of several shipwrecks, and those who sunived disaster at sea were gener-alls killed by the Indiaus. Some held as prisoners were rescued by Spauish visitors, and made known their adventures afterwards i11 Europe. The first shipwreck of which so11ie particulars are known, occurre1l in the year 15.J.5. Douht.le;;s the vessel was large, as two lrnndred of the persons on board were kille1l by the Iwliaul:'. Some were reserves aud held as sla\·e~, and of these some were alive twenty ;years after their capture. Oue was liberated b~· the Spanish Governor, Don Pedro Menendez de Aviles, about the year 1566, and in the preceding year another was saved by the F'rench commander Jean Ribaut. In the ,year 1551 a 8hip was wrecked near Cape Florida. 'l'he vessel was Spanish, and wai,: returning with gold from Peru, undPr Captain Juan Christoval. Among the passengers was a young man, Heruaudo Escalaute de Fontaneda, \Tho, ''thoug·h the poorest of all, had with him 25,000 pe8os de om." :Xothing is said of the fate of other passengers, but young Fontanella hecame a slan· to the Indiaus, and traveled in tbe country sixteen years. Ile was finally liberated and 11e11t to Spai11 by Menendez about the year lfi66. Fontanella wrote a narratfre of his adveu· tures but it ii;; of interest only as furnishing a basis for tl1e rem:uks made by Herrera respecting tlie Indies. That historian mentioned man.r names taken fro1r. Fontaneda. A more Jisastrous shipwreck occurred in the ;1·ear 1553. The great Mexican tfoet sailed iu the spring of that ~-ear from Vera Cruz and reached Havana with a thousand per;;om1, iucludiug sailors, soldiers, ai1d wealthy passengers. The ships carried gold, silver, and other valuable products. In passing the Bahamas the currn11ts put them out of the intended course, and by a storm they were throw11 on the coast of Florida, wl1ere most of the n·;;:sels were :su11k. Of the :smaller vessels one returned to Vera Cruz and the other reached Seville in Spain.
HUIDO DE LAR BAZARES, lf>f>8.

Philip JI beeame Kiug of Spain in the .rear 1555, and tlJen the Vicero~· of Mexico was Don Luis Velasco. New order!' wt:'re se11t fur the c011qut:'.~t aml settlernent of the vast regions north of the Gulf of :Mexico. There public affairs had flourished under Velasco, and much treasure had passed to Spain. The field of discovery was extended northwanl, and in the year l 555 a mining establishment was opened in the valley of one of the branches of the Hio Bra,·o del Norte. This for a long time was the most northern settlement in New Spain. In the c01mcil of the Indies in 1557 it was decided to scud an expedition to ·Florida, and in the following year an armamt'nt was prt>pared. 'l'he viceroy fitted onf dtwen o;hips and collected an army of fifteen hundred offict>rs mid me11. A ii Wt'.re take11 by prefe1t>111:e who had l'IOllll' k110" ledg-e of the country. Some who had bern shipwrecked were included, aud some wbo had been held as sla\·e!l by the Indians. Some Indians who bad adopted Spanish customs were accepted. Am()ng the captains of this army (says Barcia) were six who had been in the province of Coi;a, and there for a time kept in slavery. 'l'he province of Co9a (Coosa) is often mentioued by the historians of De Soto, but no writer mentions the return of the captives to Spain. 'l'he command of the army and fleet was given to Don Tristan de Luna y Avellano, a so11 of the :Marshal Don Carlos de Luna. As usual a preliminary examiuation was made to find a ha,rllor proper for the ileet. The reconnaissance was conducted by Guido de los Bazares, and this was prohahly his first sen-ice, a8 bis name is not meutioned in any earlier record. Vela8co, the viceroy, gave to Bazares three small vessels with sixty soldiers and sailors, and the fleet left Vera Cruz on the 3d of September, 1558, with instrnctions to examine the whole of the north shore of the Gulf. Ilazares sailed to Panuco and from thence coasted north. He landed at a }Jlace on the coast of Texas, and proceeding some miles northward fouml a large bay which he called Bahia de Rau .Francisco. This was probably Matagorda Bay. He theu weut (ai:; he says) to the "Alacrans," and seems to have passed along the coast to the eallt of the :Mississippi. Much shoal water was traversed. Be named the.place Bay of Shoals, and it was probably ObaJ.1deleur Bay. Going eastward 10 leagues he eutered a spacious port, and named it Bay of Philip, iu honor of the King. 'J'his was Pensacola Bay. ''On the whole coast (sa.rs Bazares) no port is to be found so commodious as this Baia Felipina." He found 3~ fathoms of water on the bar. 'l'he bre::iclt11 of the entrance is given as half a league, and on one side was an island 7 leugues in length. In the back ground of the bay, bills of red clay were seen. Bazares sailed eastward 20

leagues from Pensacola entrance, and tlien observed that tbe trend of the coast changed to south· east. He was twice beaten back by contrary winds from tbe Yicinity of Cape Sa11 .BlaR, and tlie wPather lwcame rongh :md cold. Hnt, as he hail found a port. for the expedition of Ge11eral Luna, he deerned it proper t.o return to Mexico, an<l lie reached Vera Cruz ou the 14th of December, 155~. It is renrnrkahlt' that tile 11arrative of Bazare;.; containo; 110 allm;ion whatever to the previous explorations and discoveries alo11g the coast of that dci11it,Y by Maldonado and Arias Gomez, who had bt·en tl1ere repeatf,dl,1. Bazares mentions all his reirnlts as new discoveries. But as on!~· fiftt>ell .'ears had elapsed some of Maldonado':,; pilots and companions were probably aliYe iu Emme of the harborl'. Cortes made uo mention in his letters of the previous exploring expeditions of Ctml<·Ya ant1 Grijalva along the coast of Mexico and Yucatan, nor would he allow his soldiers to 111e11tion their nanies in the letters which tlwy sent to Rpait1. On tlie lltll of .June, 1559, tLe fleet of Don 'l'ristan de Lnua sailed from Vera Cruz to the northward. The cltit>f pilot of ·the expedition was Juan Hodriguez. After beiug seYeuteeu days a:tloat t11e.v n'atht·d the mouth of tlie .Mississippi, and eiglit days ·afterwards came in sight of the coast of Flmi11a, prohahly in the \'i~inity of Cupe Sau Blas. The exprditi011 of De J,nna was unfortunate. Soon after the army was lamled a hurricane d('strosed tlw tl~t. Only m1e sbip waR left, which happily had started for Yera Cruz. The army sutl'en·<l for waut of sub:siHteuce. The proYince of Coosa was sought, hut it was a n1st wilderness filled with savage tribes. Some of tbe 1<oldiers perished with Lunger aud thirst, and others were killed i11 hattles wit!J the .savage:,;. In one of the expeditions it sPmm; tLat tl1e,1 approached the Mississippi a11d crossed it. Fre1H'l1 l'rotesta11ts l1ai1 made i;ettlements OH the coast of Flori<la, at phwes that seemed to th1eate11 the 8afety of the lSvauish i,;ilver fleets on the home voJ·ages, and these irnluced expedi· tious conducted by the Spanish Admiral, Don Pedro l\'leneudez de A \'iles; he was au officer of distinction, and had served under Charles and Philip II. In the American colony he had gained wt>alth. HiR only son commanded the Mexican fleet, which, :.is alrt>ady o;tated, was car;t 11way on tLe coast of I·'lorida, in the year 1553. Ele\·en year8 afterwards when liberated from an accusation, lie requested permission and assistance for sending an expedition to Florida. The grant was conferrl'd by tl1e King, on condition tlrnt Meneudez should make a survey of the I<'lorida coast, and try to efit'ct HOUH:\ settlements. His fieet was, therefore, in fa·u of a searching expe1litiou enlarged to the. uumbn of ten \'essds, 1d1ich carried i:;ix lrnudre<l men as officers, soldieri;;, sairors, nud laud,:;meu. The conditious iu his instructions eujoiued that within three ,n·ars he sl1ould explore the countr,r of Florida, iI1clu<li11g inlets and bays, aud "mark tliem so that they coulrl be laid dowu 011 the sea cliart1; and made known to mariners; he was to sune_y the ports, rocks, and uurreuts, aml make a descript iou of tbern, so that the seerets of the coast might be brougLt cle11rl;r to lig11t." Meanwhile it was expected tbat be should 8ettle six lmmlre<l me11 to cult h·ate tlle c01111trr, plant sugar cane, and erect forts for defense, as amougst the valuables landed were one huntlrell horses, two hundred bead of cattle, four hundred swine, nud the same number of shee11 and goati:;. Tbe outfir was amvle, and the privileges extensive. But when l\foneudez was about to sail it became know11 in Spaiu that Frt>nch ll ugueuot:; hacl settled 011 the coast of Florida, and it was also said that French reinforct>ment:s were to follow. Tl1e Sp1rnish King, therefore, enlarged the commission of :Meneudez, and anthorized him to alitack and promptly destroy any heretics fouuu in Florida. The entire armarueut consisted of thirty-four vessel;,;, and upward;,; of twenty-six huudred meu. Menendez was made lll'l'lH"tual Adelantado, hereditary Governor, and Captain-General of Florida. He hastened to that coast, came suddenly upon the .French, and destroyed them iu September, 1563. After erecting some fortifications lie sailed to Havana, and was there joined by all tlie vessels of the fleet. Furtl1er meaus were then taken for search respectiug his sou. ~ome ships were sent to Saint Augustine, and in person he went to the wt·st side of' the peninsula on the 10th of February, 1566. At Charlotte Harbor he found isome Christians held as ca11tfres by the Indians. These lie lilJerated, hut he could bear nothing concerning his sou. He iiassed aloug and examined the florida Keys, iu March 1566, but no sketch or map is extant if any was made. Of the geographical names introduced by Menendt>z only two deser-ve mention. One is 'l'egeste, for a place near Cape Florida, and the other is Tooobaga, for an Indian chief aud tribe

French and English privakers followed Spanish navigators at an early date in the "\Vest lndiel'I. Oue English ad veut urer is mentioned ais appearing· at· Porto Rico as early as the year 1519.

Tompson's travel.s into the interior of :Mexico have no iutPrest for our narrative of coast discovery or development. Roger Bodenharn, another Eug-lishman settled at Seville as a merchant, also went to .Mexico. Ile say.s that he embarked on tliat Mexican fleet that crossed the ocean mH.ler command of Don Pedro l\It.>11e11dez in .May, liiG4.

V\Te k1ww that tlie son of Don Ped10 l\"Ie11endez was sliipwrPck('d with a rl'turniug Mexican fleet iu th<' ~·ear 1553 on tbe coast of Florida. llaklu,yt mentions the rnyage of a certain .John Chiltou, and also the vo·~·age of Henry Ilawketi, uotb of wl1orn went to Mexico. But the~e i1eaceful excursions were followed by warlike expetliti011s. Sir .1ollll Hawkim1, iu tlie year 156~, took uegro slan;; to San Domingo, sold tbem there, and with the vroeeeds took a ntluable cargo, and retumed to Eugland by way of .Florida Ke.rs. He wHs aguiu iii the Gulf tliree years later, having sailed from England with three rnssels on the 18th of October, 15ti4. On tl1at \'O,Yage allso Le took slaves to the West Jndies, and compelled the Spanish settkrs to bu~· them at his own price. After traw1si11g the Caribbean Sea, the vest:1elt:1 arrived at Cape San Antonio 011 the 17th of J m1e, 1565. By enrn·uts the navigation became difficult, but after some trouble he again entered the Gulf of Florida. Ifawki11s was the 1irst E11gfo1hman who ex11lored the Tortngas Islands, and iu July he passed the BaLama Chmrnel and coasted along the eaf>t side of tbe .Florida peninsula. For llis third rnyage Hawkins sailt.>d from l)l~·ruouth in October, 1567, with ;;ix vessels. Passing as beforn h;r way of the coast of Africa, he took negrot>s, went to the Caribbetin Sea, and from thence to Cape Sau Antonio.

The port of Vera Cruz was e11tered without opposition ; hut a fow days after the arrival of Hawkins he was attacked by a Spanish fleet which had brought out the uew :M:exica11 Viceroy, Don Martin Henriquez. Many of the English were killed, some were captured, and only two of the ships, the Minion and the Judith escaped. 'l'hese were soon after separated, and in tht· Minion, the commauder with a shattered vessel fioated fourteen days on au unknown !lea. Ou the 8th of October they reached land somewhere uear tlrn mouth of tlie Hio de laR Palmas, the lwundar_y between Mexico ~rnd Florida. At Vera Cruz some of ti1<> crews of the wrecked vessels had beeu taken on board of the .Miniou. The ship was so much crowded tbat some of the company preferred to risk their lin~s 011 shore, eitl1er aruungst tlte lm1iaus, or b,y trusting to the benevolence of Spallish settlers. After taking in water for the voyage Hawki111s 1-miled, :md after enduring many hardships arrfred in England on the 20th of ,January, 15GU. Doubtless the party left, about one hundred, landed near the River Sa11tarnler. Uifforiug iu n·gard to the lJest course for their extrication, fifty of the number tra\'eled along the coast southward, iu hope of findiug a Spanish settlement. The others went northward; They clwse as eaptaius or Jeaden1 John Hooper and David Ingram. But being soon attaeked hy ho!ltile Iuclians, twent~· fh'e of tlrn party returned and joined those who had traveled so11tl1warrl. Th<> rt>maini11g twenty.five kept 011 northward and with them waH Ingram. They marched toward8 the Rio Bm,·o; hut 11othing is kuown of tlieir fate. Hakluyt mentions onl~· one other English captain aR Laving .-ntered the Gulf of Mexico, up to the close of the sixteenth ceutUQ'. This was 'William l\f ichelson, in the slli11 Dogge, who chased aud captured several Spanish ,·essels. He was, however, e11connten'1l b:y a Spa1iish rna11-uf-war 1111<l uarrowl~· escnpnl capture. As a co111pa11io11 of Hawki11s. mw wlw i11 ti11w bc<':lllW famous, was Sir l<'rancis Drake. He was in the Gulf in 15G8. Hakluyt seems to have heeu the first in the issue of sailing tlirectio11s, hut pie notei; were prnllal1l.r t1·a11scrib.-<l from Spanish documents, as the orthography of the Spanish names is perfect. The descriptions, however, make 110 reference to poiuts above the twenty-fourth parallel, 11or to harbors of the uorth au<l west coast of the Gulf; but the Florida Keys and the Tortugas are mention.-d. .At this time no sailing directions Lad been compiled in Spain. After the disastrous expeditions of Narvaez, De Soto, Luu a, aud othen·, a Spanish author of the period exclaims: "To the south! to the south! ther.- lie our treasures," and that feeling seems to have been general amongst his com1tryrnen. Ou the .Atlantic coast also wl1ere the Spaniard Gomez had coasted eHm to New England, aJJd M"1endez had planned a colony on Chesapeake Ray, progress was stopped. ()H tlu:> Pacific coast, Cabrillo aud Vizcaino had passed above Cape Mendocino, bnt nothing was done afterwards for more than a hundred and fifty years. Occasionally some eame;;t religionist offered for a mis· sionary tour t-0 the north, but the attempts made did not prosper. Some disastrous shipwrecks induced orders for tlie snffey of the Florida Keys and other p;trts of the4fast, but no record is left if the surveys were made. .Each year the Spanish fll·ets, with treasure from the Mexican mines, made their Yoyages through the middle and northern parts of the Gulf. but it is not certain that any ves:sel at that time passed into the J'llississip11i Delta. The settlements founded by Cortes in Yucatan and Mexico were maintai11ed, aml attemcts were made to extend them northwards, hut tlie progress was very slow. Usually the fleets from Spain passed south of Domiuica or Guaduloupe, aud saile1l along the southern coasts of Porto Rico, San Domingo, and Cnha, aml then rounded into the Gulf h:r way of Cape San Antonio. Menendez, in the year 1567, was the first uavigator who entered from the eastward against the Gulf Stream in order to reach Havana, but iu general the custo111 waH retained to sail by the south shore of Cuba. From Uape San £<\.ntouio to New SJlain two routes were used, one for summer and the other only in winter. Tl.tese were defined by the Alaerans and other dangerous reefs. The landmarks relied on for arrival on the coast of Mt>xico wf:'re the high peaks of Orizaba and tbe hills of Saint. :Martin. Th~se were noticed h~· Grijalva in the ypar 1519. Between September and April, when northers were likely to happeu, ships kept further from the coast and went outside of the .A.Iacrans, the Verrueja, the Triangle, and other hanks and reefs of the coast of Yucatan· .Amongst the sailing directions quoted by Hakluyt from the Spanish autl:orit_y was the follow· ing: being near t£e Tortugas, you sountl and find white sand very tine, you are east and west

But Huiz an<l the friar Francisco Lopez remained with tlrn nati\-es, who seemed to ue frielJ(lly. Anxiet;r in regard to them induced the

semling of another membPr of the order, Friar Bernardin Beltnui1, and he went out accompanied hy some soldiers. There was then a wealthy settler in the valley named. Antonio Espejo. He was a man of great courage, offored to lead a northern expedition, and also meet the expenses, provitled that certain advantages should he concedNl to him. This was <lone. He gatliere<l a company of ;.;oldie.rs, procurNl horses, mules, mnuitions, aild \·ictinl:-;, and i,;tarteu from the valle,Y on th<.; 10th of -Sovemher, 1582. He traveled along the conrse of tl1e great' ltio <lei 1'\ol'to, pa,ssed many Irnlian trilws, aud uarned the country New Me-xico. Ou hil' route be was tol<l that the Indian;:; htli killell the two friars. Ruiy, and Lopez, and the natives mentioned also the passage of Narvaez ti.trough tl1e n·gion. West of the river tlJe~- sougl1t Acoma aml Zuni and were iuformed of the march of Uoronado. Some Spaniards remained there after his time. E:-;pe;jo went furtl1er west, but most of his companiou!' left the senice, and returned by way of tlw Rio BmTo to .Mexico. \Vith tho1:;e who remained lie seems to ha\'e passed to the headwaters of the river, and tl1en went eastward. They were i11 the Buffalo country in ,Jnly, 1583. 4''inding a riw.r i·trnning south they weut in that direction 120 leagues, ever~· where fiu<ling herds of cattle. They 1 no doubt, thus traversed the western part of the State of Texa:s. Soon af'tl'!r these discoveries by l~niz and Espejo, the military expedition of Oil.ate set out, and as a rPsnlt tho city of Santa Fe was settled. Iu a work printed at .Madrid in 1586 it is plainly 1:;tatc<l that the Hio Bra rn empties into tLe Gulf of .Me.xico. But long after some European geogrn phet~ n·pn'~euted that ifrer a1:; e111pt;yi11g into the Gulf of California.

Some have supposed that it was the Mississippi, but the notice is so \'ague that no inference can be fonn<led upon it. Dming the Tllirty-Yean; vVar, privateers and pirates had no rPstraint, and bnccanrers flourished. Iu one port of Flanders a.Ione could be counted, in tbe year rn:.H, not leRs than three hundred barkH manned by pirates. Dutch, E11glisb~ and French tilibnsterR were chasing Spanish ships in all directi-;.,ns. 111 1640 the buccaue<>r Pierre le Graml, from the Tortugas, with a band of twent~·-eigl1t tlt's1ieratloes, attacked the ship of the Spanish Yke-Admiral of the Mexica11 fleet, aml took all tlJe treasure found in the ves8el to France. Some years earlier 1lie Mexican fleet wl1en passing throngli thP Babama chanuel wa;; met hs a he[ff,\ Rtorm. Some of the vessels were wreckt·1l on th!' coast of Florida; the Admiral's ship fonnderf'd, her papers were lost, arnl thus the affairs of Vlorida were brought into confnsiou. Only two of tbe ships P8caped and finally reached Cadiz. Early iu .lalluary, l65U, Spauish galeorns sailed from Danna witb the Marques .Monte Alegri, but by a furiouR gale were soon driven back anrl scattered iu tile G-nlf.

In May, 1678, he obtained a patent from the King of Frauce "to endeaYor to discover the western part of New Frauce, through which it is probable a road mig·bt be found leading· to Mexico." He was also authorized to erect such forts and habitations as rnigl1t he 11eedful for his purposes. At some point west of the Falls of Niagara he built a ship,· and passed into Lake Michigan with provisions. A small fortification was erected, and anotlwr on the banks of tLe Illiuois Ri\·er, in order to secure his route on the return. After many difficulties he bPgan th!' desee.ut of the river in canoes on the 13th of January, 1682, with twenty-one Frenchmen ai1d a number of Canadian Indians. :Father Zenobe Membre, who was one of the party, Wl'otc a report of the voyagP, and Sicur Henri de Tont.r, the most aetiv-e associate of La Salle, subsequently became an energetic explorer in the same region. In the narratins of that time the Mississippi i8 mentioned as "Riviere Colbert," in honor of the prime minister of France, the patrou of I,a Salle. Some of the contemporary accounts name the region tbrougl1 wl1ich the r'iYer flows "La Louisiane," in honor of the King of France. The expedition pas.-;ed the mouths of t11P Oliio and the )1issouri, arul on the 12th of March was at the mouth of Arkansas Rin·r. 8ome ludian tribes were passetl on the route, probably the same as had been rneutioned in tlie report of De Soto. The mouth of the Red RiYer is indicated erroneously, and no name is attached to the river. 011 Ea11ter S1111das (2!ith of March) the explorers arrived at the Delta of the Mississippi, and on the 6th of April reached the shores of the Gulf of Mexico. Three bands were then equipped to sound au<] explore the Jnt8ses of the river. La Salle took the western side, M. de Tonti the rni(ldle channel, arnl Sieur Dautray the eastern pass. All the channels were found to be navigable, and were reportt·cl as hf'ing deep. 'l'he parties again united on the 9tl1 of April, and with religious ceremonies ''took possession" of tlie count1·y. La Salle wished to explore east and west of the Delta, hut want of prn·dsions ouliged him to retnru. He started northward on the 10th uf April1 and iu Scpt<>111 b<'I' was again at the port on Lake Michigan. In the ;year 1685 he was again in France preparing au t>xpcdition for moving up the Mississippi. The issue of the adventure was unfortunatt>. Two years later, after haYing trayersf.'d the reg·ion watered by the great river, La Salle, in 1G87, was killed by mutiiwers when he was eudeavoring to get back to New France. The force which he led was ample. In four vessels he took two hundred and eighty persons-soldiers, workmen, and meelrnnics-with implements, provisions, and munitions for the establishmeut of a fort. On the 1st of August, 1684, tlie Yessels sailed from Uochefort, and after passing into tbr Gulf of Mexico were apparently moved h:v chance towards the Delta. They passed far to the westwartl of tlw l'lltrance, and ut last ancli11red i11 J\Iatagol'dit Ba.y. Exct>pti11g the commautler, all \H·n· di~comaged, arnl two of the YeSst:'ls r!'tnrn{'d to Frnm:e. La Salle remained witlJ oue vessel, and from a camp 11ear tl1e entrance of the bay made several excursions in hope of finding 8ome branch of the Missis1:iip11i. By a series of mhihaps bis vessels were all destroyed, and he was thns dep1'iYed of the possiuility of succor from tbe :French colony at San Domingo, to which the i11tention was to have recourse ill the event of disaster. Renee it was essential to' reach the Mississippi b;v land in order to communicate with Fm nee b,y way of Canada. On the. 22d of April, 1 H86, h11 set ont 011 a uortheastern eourse, probably to avoid tbe marshes and rfrer mouths. Many stn·ams were passed before be reaclicd a placl' inhabited by Indians. The savages received the Frenchmen in a friendly mamwr, and promised favor to aU of that uation. Hl.'re La Salle fell daugeronsl.v ill, an<l was detained by fever during two months; and in that pl'riml much of the proviBion was commrned by his party: Some of liis men deserted, others died. The comnnrndn was tlius eonstraiued to return to the fort, which he reached after an absence of six montl1s, on the 17th of October, 1686. He again took the field on the Ith of ,January, Hi87, leaving the fort iu charge of the Sieur le Barbier, but at some point between the Brazos and Trinity River lrn was slain, as already related, on the 19th of March, 1687 1 b~' some reckless membeJS of his party. The French hitd been anticipated in this region. La Salle and his men found Spanish horses in common use amongst the Indians, and some of them were procured for the transportation of the baggage. Moreover, some of the Indians were in Spanish costume, an~ were p08Resl!led of iron tools and silver spoons. Some pictures of saints and papers were found amongst them, and a few Spanish words were iu nse, as "capita" for eotnmandtJf', and "eohavillo" for lt<Wse. Tile

Indians were much in fear of the Spaniards, and frequeutly mcntioued that inroads lia<l l>e.eu made in their country from the uortll west. The conspirators who umrdered J,a Salle resolved to settle in the country of the Ceuis, l>nt soon 11uarreled among t!Jerusekes, and some of the ruffians were tlm:s killed. .The adherents of La Salle continued his intended exploration, and again set out in Jrn1e, tuarchiug to the uortbea.st. Amongst them wern a brother autl a nephew of La Salle. Several larg·e rhers were crossed, and on the 27th of .Tune they crossed what is, doubtless, Red Ri\'er. At the end of July the wout11 of the Arkansas was reached, and at the first French habitatiou the party embarked, 011 tht> 1st of .August, to return to Canada. Few of tl1e names giYeu b~· J_,a Salle and liis Frt'nch companions to ri,·ers and places in Texas are now known in geography. One exception i,; tlrnt pertaining to the little river near his Fort Saiut Louis, namel.r, "IJa Hfriere des B0:~ufa," wliich the Spauitirdi; translated as " Hio de las V acas," and wl.tich is at present known as Lavaca Bit-er. 1U the summer of the year J fi85, La Salle's friend, tile Sieur Hcmi de Touty, was notified from Frauee that J,a, Salle had sailed for the mouth of the Mississippi. De Tonty therefore embarked in tl1e autumn of the same year for the south end of Lake l\Iichigan, aud left Fort Saiut J,ouis on the 16th of February, 1686. He rea0hed the Gulf, but fiudiug no trace of La Salle, sent out two canoes to make search. One of these went we!'itwanl towards the coast of .Mexico, the other went east,ward. Each made about thirty leag·ues and then stop1wd for want of fres!J water. De 'l'ont,\· noticed that the Gulf waters rose aud fell "not more tllan two feet perpendicularly on the coai;t." He found also the cross with the arms of the King of I<'rance, which La Salle had stt up in tue year 1682. It had been displaced by tioods, and was therefore removed aud set at a point on higher ground about five leagues further up the stream. De Tonty addressed a letter to La Salle and left it in the care of some Indian chief at. the 1\fississippi delta, and tl1at letter was found fourteen years afterward in possession of the same Indians by the French officer Bien,·me. De Touty was a man of uucom!!lon energy. After tlwrougl1 search for La Salle iu vain, he proposed to his companious to returu to Canada by Wa.Y of the coast of the Atlantic. The members of his party were unwilling to leave a kno"'u course, so tumiug back ther kept along the Mississippi, aud arrived at Montreal near the close of Jul;r, 1685. He introduced the name "Red River" in our geography, and says of it: "The Indians call this great riYer Riviere Rouge, because it deposits a sand which makes the water as red as 1Jlood." De Tout.y states that lie made a map of the Mississippi River, aud that the map was sent to France, but nothing is known respecting it.
.JUAN ENRIQUEZ BARROTO, 1685.

Information respecting La Salle's voyages was sent to Mexico by Don Andres di:' Ochoa y Caratc, commander of the Spanish fleet in Gulf waters. He obtained the particulars b~· tue capture M a French inivateer on the coast of Yucatan. On receipt of the intelligence the Marques de la Laguna, Viceroy of Mexico, st·11t at the end of the ;year 1684 a pilot named Barroto to Havana, with order to the Go'\"'ernor of Cuba that without delay a vessel should be made ready for an expedition to the Gulf. Barroto is recorded as "a distinguished mathematician, and a man of great expericuee i11 tMse waters." He was intrusted with the command and was instructed to sa-il to the hay of Apalache, and then to examine the coast for auy M·ttlement that La Salle might have established. He left Havana in .January, and " registered" the bayi; and capes of the north coast, more particularl_y that part between Apalache Bay and the cape which he calls Cabo del Lodo [C:qie of Mud] .. He traver8~d also the Baia de Santa Maria, which is now known as Pensacola Harbor. But no settlement was found, nor any trace whatever of Europeans. Ma11y hardships were encountered, and he was obliged to return to Vera Cruz. Barroto sent a uarratfre and chart to the Marques de la Laguna, who transmitted the doeument1-1 to the King. The chart is not extant, but the report mentions the name Caho de Lodo [Mudd;}· Cape] as applied to tlie projecting l'lpiti; a.nd broken ground at the delta. That name appears on all Spauil'.lh charts of the eighteenth

century.
At the end of the year 1686 another viceroy, Don Melchor Portocarrero, Count of MonclO\'a, arrived in Mexico with a. commission which authorized him to expel the French from the Gulf,

anrl to destroy their settlements. He reached Vera Cruz in September, 1686, and assembled a counsel of pilots aud commamlen;, and by them the chart made by Rarroto was inspected. 'l'he viceroy learned as the result that Rarroto had not closely examined the coast, and that foreigners might be where Barroto had not been. Two armed vessels were prepared to expel the French, and, as was then usual on such occasions, two smaller vessels were fitted out to make preliminary search. The8e were intrusted t-0 the command of Don Martin de Ribas and Don Pedro de Iriarte, but the chief pilot was Barroto. The vessels saileu from Vera Cruz 011 the 1st of .Tauuary, 1687, for the bay of Apalache, bnt violent storms and contrary winds in crossing the Gulf delayed the passage so that Apalacbe was not reached until the beginning of May. It seems probal:Jle that the experience of the pilot Barroto as a navigator alo11e saved the vesRels from destruction. They finally entered a spacious bas and found two fathoms of water on the bar. The wrecks of two French ships were seen near the entrance. La Salle was killed iu l\farch, 1687, l:Jut some of his party were then living at F-0rt Saint I,ouis. The surviYors sailed for Havana because the winde were unfavorable for Vera Cruz, but to that port they turned after a stay of three day:s on the coast of Cuba. At Havana they had been given up as lost in the furious storms that prevailed in the spring of the year. The viceroy therefore ha.ste11e1l the <leparture of two armed vessels under the command of Do11 Andres de Pes and Do11 .Francisco Gornarra. They had the distinguished pilot Luis Gomez Raposo, and examined tlle entire coast of the Gulf. On reaclting Saiut Bernardo or Saint l1uis rMatagorda Bay J they a.Iso saw the remains of the two ships of La Sa.He's ·expedition. Having closed the examination, they arrive1l at Vera Cruz on the 14th of September, Hi87. Barroto bad already reached that port. As successor to the Count de Monclova, the Conde de Galva arrive(l in Mexico and became Yiceroy in the autumn of 1()88. Soon after it Wal'\ known to him that in the frontier settlement at the north, three Frenchmen liad appeared who stated that. other Frenchmen were yet alfre in that regiou. Orders were gh'en to search for the French. A year earlier Alonzo de Leon had erected a small fortification south of the Rio Bravo and named it in honor of the Viceroy "Fort Monclova." From thence, in January, 1689, he set out at the head of a 1mrty of horsemen and went north and 11ortlwast, accompanied by a geographer who was to take particular notice of discoveries. After a long march a lagoon was reached and was named San Bernardo. Fort Saint Louis had been abandoned. Eighteen pieces of cannon were found scattered on the ground and some dead bodies of the French invaders. The Iudians said that five Frenchmen of the expedition were yet alive in the "Provincia de los Texas," which was a hundred leagues distant. This nallle appears to designate the country and a Indian tribe which La Salle named the '' Cenis." By lndian messengers Leon sent a letter to the five Frenchmen, and two of them came to him. In the month of May be preseute<l them to the Yiceroy of Mexico, and to that official they made k11ow11 the histor~· of the expedition of La Salle, including mention -0f his settlement at Saint Bernard's Bay, his movement along the Mississippi and his ultimate fate. To preserve the power of Spain the viceroy resolved that the Gulf coasli should be settled; that the province of Texas should be provided with defenses, and that possession should be takeu of the best naval position near the mouth of the Mississippi. For strengthening the armament-at Pensacola, Andres de Pes was sent to Spain to make due representations at court. To favor settlements in Texas ise\·eral s:mall forts and missions were established in the year 1690, and Don Domingo Teran was appointed Governor of " tl1e provinces of Coahuila and Texas." Hut this effort of the Spaniards to settle that country was unfortunate. Indians were numerous; the cattle died, and the crop8 failed. In tlte ,Year 16H3 only a few Spaniards remained in the province. On the 25th of l\f arch, 1688, a Spanish force !'.!ailed from Vera Cruz. The war ship wa8 secured in Mobile Bay, and the smaller vessel passecl westward to the mouth of the Mississippi, which river was then known as nio de la Pali9ada. The earlier name "Rio del Espiritu Santo" WIUl apparently then forgo'tten. The adventure was fruitless and the vessels were again at Vera Cruz oµ the 10th of May. Under the orders of the viceroy, Andres de Pes went to Spain, and the King, pleased with his int;elligent and pa.triotfo exertions, name4 bim Admiral of the Mexican Gulf fleet; and for

services already rendered conferred on him the habit of the order of St. Iago. He returned to Mexico in the year 1692 with the royal sanction for completely forti(ying Pensacola. Jn the following year (April 8, 1693) two Spanish vessels, under thfl directiou of l>e Pes1 entereu Pensacola, Bay, and the learned .Professor Siquenza at ouce declared that it was the same ba.rhor in which Pamfilo de NarYaez diRembarked, and which Diego de )ialdouado had discovered nnder the name of "Achnsi" in De Soto's time. Pes and Siquenza e.xamined all tlie snores a.ml indentations in boats, and gave names to the points, capes, bays, and ri,·ers. Many of the name;;; appear on charts of the preseut day. At Mobile Bay the same navigators explored onl~· near the entrance but di<l uot enter the body of the bay, Keeping on westward tbe,\' came, 011 the 1st of May, to a point which they named "San Miguel,'' a11d judging that there might be some passage towards the Missh1sippi they entered with boats, but found only broken ground. Through a narrow channel they entered a large lake, but beyond it could not pass into the river, and in consequence they returued to their ships. The name Punta de Sau 1ilignel on later Spaui8h clrnrts ioi marked at the eastern An trance of Lake Borgue. De Pes was afterwards Governor of the lmlian council, and one of the chief officers of the Spanish Admiralty. In the i11;;;nription on his monument he is styled "Sinus 1lfe.ricani Scrutator." De Soto's pilot, Maldonado, bad reported Pensaeola Bay (then ealled Saint Mary's) as being the most convenieut place on the Gulf' for a marine and military establishment, but no settlement was made there until the year 1696, when Dou Andres de Arriola went. from Vern Cruz aml built a fort. But its position was commanded by higlier ground, and there was no freRh water inside of the Jines of fortification. However. no foreign enemy was to he feared, and the neighboring llldians only were kept in view. No fears seem to liave bet>n entertained respecting tlie French. The soldiers of Arriola understood from the Indians that they called the country around the bay "Pan<;acola," wltich they said was the name of a nation that had been dispossessed by tlie present owners of the ground. Arriola is styled in the contemporary record "T11e first Governor of Parn:acola."
IBERVILLE, 16H8-'\l\I,

Lemoyne d'Iberville was a Canadian gentleman ; had shown resolntiou in opposing thr English in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Hudson's Bay. He had trave!'sed immense tracts of land and water, aml after expelling t.he English from Hnds011'" Bay lie aimecl at establishing French empire in NO\·th America, and deeming the control of the Mississippi essential he persuaded the French minister, Count Pontchartrain, after the peace with England in l6H7, to attempt the occupation of the mout.b of the great river. Pontchartrain ordered the arming of two men of war at Rochefort, and gaYe the command t-0 Iberville. Oue account states that Chateaumorand joined the expedition at San Domingo with the sbip Le Fraucoi.s. Iberville was accompanied by two of' his brothers, namely, t.be Sieur Lemosne Bienville and the Siem Lemoyne Souyole, and both of them were distinguished in tht> history of discovery. The expedition sailed on the l 7th of October, 1698, and made the passage into tl1e Gulf of Mexico by way of San Domingo. It was a.ccompanied by the French atl\·enturer Laurent <le Graff, or Grave, who had made himself formidable to the Spaniards under the uame of "TJorencillo." Be seems to ha Ye served as piJot and guide. Iberville an<l Chateaumorand reached Pensacola on the 25th of December, and there to their disappointment found a Spanish fort. So keeping on westward they came to t.hc entrance of' Mobile Ba:,', and lan1lell at Panphine lslaud. Hertl were found skeletons of' hurrH\.n heings, antl some anthori,i judge that they were the remainR of the unt'ortunate followeni of NarYaez in the Jear 1529. Passing ou, Iberville took souudings a.ml ancbor<'d near an iRla11d, which from that inci<lent was then named ''Ship faland." On the 11th of .February a little bay was eutererl, and from an Indian tribe was 11amed "la .Baic de Biloxis." Soon after a ri\'er mouth was seen, and from another Indian tribe was named "Riviere des Pascagoulas7 Having receh·ed from the native;;; information about a. great river which they calle1l "Malboucbia," Ibenil\e and his brotlier Bieuvilloi set out on 2ith of February from Ship Island in two boats for exploration~ believing that the river indica~ to them was tbt> Mississippi. On the 2d of March they f:'ntere<l a. Jarg<~ river with turbid waters. After tracing the co11rst1 for 00 lf'agnes t11ey came to au Judiirn natiou <·aJled "0uma," and

fonn<l amon,g-8t them prayer-hook8 in which the names of some of the Oana<lian companions of La Salle were written. The Indians hail :tl8o, and delivered the letter which Tonti addressed to La Salle in the year 1685. Ou the 22d of '.\farch they arrive\l at a narrow and shallow branch of the river leading eastward. Two lakes were fonud and named I1ac Maure pas and Lac Pontchartrain, and a few days afterwards Iberville was joine.d (l\farch 31) by his brother Bienville at the ship statiou. On the 12th of April a little bay was entered and was named "r,a Baie de Saint Loni8," but the w3te1· being s!Jallow, it was decided to Bettle at Biloxi. A fort was built, and was manned by tltirty-tirn of the followers of S:mvole and Biem·ille. Iber\·ille on the 4th of May set sail for France, intending to bring an additi01rnl force for the Rettlement. In the conrsc of the summer of 1699 Sanvole and Bienville made excursions in the vicinity of the fort to gain the friendship of the nativeR. At the end of May, lliendlle set out for Pascagoula Rfrer. Six feet of water wa.s then found on tlie har. On the !)th of ,June a lanrl journey was made to Mobile Bay, and the party pas1-1e1l on from thence to Pensacola Bay to observe the action or tbe SJ)aniards, who were tben fonncl to he established in their fort. In ,Jul;-.· two missionaries and a number of Canadians arrived at Biloxi. When told by Indians of the new ]'rench settlement they descended the Mississippi in two canoes and thmi joined with countrymen who had reached the Rame region h,\' way of the Gulf of Mexico. At a hcnd of the river, 28 leagues from from the sea, Bieuville, to his gre:at surprise, found an Englfah YeRsel anned with twelYe guns and commarnle<l by a Captain Barr. When notified that he was au intruder the -Englishman left, hut threatened to return in the following year. ThiR meeting was 011 the 15th of September antl the place lias since that dat{l been called "le Detonr aux Anglais," 'i.e., tbe "English Rend." On the 7th of Dt>cember Jl)erville reached Biloxi after his visit to I 1'rance, and with him came officers and pas:spngers i11 the s!JipR J,a Renommee and lAt Gironde. Orants seem to h:n·r bepn coufern:d upon a Colonel 'Vood, of Virginia, who was there residt':nt between 1654 and HiG4; a1Hl again in the .vear 1678 a number of persons are Raid to have rnove·l from New England for cliscoYerics in New Mexico, bnt only casual mention can be found of these un dertaking·s. When the English Rettled in Uarolina, they claime<l all the territory westward to the Pacific Ocean. Charles I, of England, hail granted bJ· patent to Sir Robert Heath, then attorney·general, the undefined region. By him it was trnnsfened to the Earl of Arundel. It is beyond doubt that English ad Yen turns arrived on the lower :\fississippi aH ea,rly as the year rn99. Bienville, the Frem~hman, states tliat on the 23d of April of that year be was informed by Pascagoula Intlia.118 tlmt on tbe 2l8t of that month two :Englishmen, with two hundred Uhicasaws, had plundered and destroyed one of their villages. The narratiYe of Dr. Coxe mentions that be fitted out two vessels for exploratiou. These sailed from England in the year 1698, under the command of Captain Barr. One of the vessels had au armament of twe11ty-two guns, the other of twclYe guns. In the summer of 1699 they were in the Gulf of Mexico, and had as pilot the French engiueer Seeou. Captain Barr seems to have at first entered the bay east of the delta, and he calls it N assa.u Bay, tlrn same (saJs Daniel Coxe) "which the Spaniards designate as Spiritn Santo Bay." After passiug the i1-1larnh; or l\lissiHsippi Sound, Barr enterecl Mobile Ba;r. This was probably ne,ar the close of the year 1699. On tlie bornewarcl voyage one of Barr's vessels was wrecked on the coast of England aml offieers an1l men were lost; but the journal and a full account of the country along the coasts were saved. All the bays, islands, and riYers denoted bj· Iberville and Bienville can be readily identified, as some of them yet lw,ar the 11ames attached l1y those explorers : as SMp, Horn, and <Jat islands ; also the Chau<lelear Islands, Saint Louis Bay, Biloxi Bay, and Pascagoula River, Iberville River, Lakes Manrepas and Pontchartrain, the Rigolets, and Bayou La Fourche. In February, 1700, De Tonti again passed down the Missi!'lsippi t.o inspect the settlement at Iberville, as he Jiad fifteen Jears earlier jounrnyerl in behaJf of such as may have been intended by La Salle. The enterprising traveler De Tonti died in the year 1704, at ~lobile Bay. He bad passed.four times up and down the Mississippi. In Augm1t, 1706, the active Iberville died of yellow fever at Havana. In the j'ear 1708 a French officer, M. Dirond'Artaguette, arrived from France to act

as commissary, and to decide on the policy of maintaining a port. Massacre Island wal5 examined, the waters of the vicinity were sounded, and when in the year 1711 tbe settlemeut at. Saint Louis was inundatcu, Bienville was directed to remoYe to a position 8 leagues farther down. The place selected was at-the delta of Mobile Hfrer. In September, 1712, the King of France confo.rred the management and commerce of tlie Fl'euch colony, in Louisiana, upon an enterprising financier of great wealth, M. Crozat, and as was theu common in governmental ebauges a new impulse was given for exploratious. Tbc action of Spai11 was at that time feeble. Feariug the French they bad endeavored to expel them; hut they dreaded also the l<Jnglish. This condition was changed aft.er the grant of Louisiana to Croz<tt. France and Spain lost their common intert>st. Defense against encroachments by the English, and the grant to Crozat, to which the King of Spain harl from the firnt been opposed, were iu Spain re. garded as acts of hostility. But Crozat inspired the French in Louisiana with a spirit of activity of which the Spaniards became jealous; and thus further expeditions and clisco,·eri._,s resulted from emulation between the two great powerA which ha(l then founded settlements on the short>s of tbe Gulf of Mexico. By royal decree Crozat bad exclusire right cludng tiftee11 years to 1;end product..:; from 1.ouisiana to France free of duty, aml to i11troduce slnw:s from Africa. Ile was aecordf'll thr monopoly of all mines that might be found in the valley of the l\lissii;;sipili; was allowed to have his own commissaries and directors for exploring and for making tre<itieR with the Indians, aud for guarding hi;;; own private interests. 'l'he King required merely the tra11sportatio11 needful awl provisiom1 for officers and soldiers assigned for defence. The first vessel sent out under the grant arrived in Lonisia11a i11 the spring of the year 1713, with the Royal Goyernor De la Motte Cadillac and Rome commercial directorn arnl agents a.ppointed by Crozat. 'Vith large views that active mau gave attention not only to 111e fur trade, hut ali;o to commerce aml navigation tlirough the Gulf' of Mexico. His aiw wai;; to fake merd1audise from r,onisiana to J>eusacola, to 'rampico, to Vera Cruz, to Tnspan, aud to Havana. Hy hiR agents, trading journeys were made along the Mississippi and lted Hiveri-;, and amongist them tlw most conspicuous traveler was St. Denis, who was well acquaiuted with the countr,r. Iu the year 1714 he was sent to the southwest amongst the Spanish missions, then supposed t.o be in tl1e province, aml was autbor!zed t.o make o>ertures to the Spanish settlers for intercourst~ an!l trade. Attended lJy a few Canadians and Indians, the energetic St. Denis entered Tt"xas ne.a.r the close of the year 1715, and stopped in the vicinit~· which had lJeen occupied by J,a. Sa.llP'A companions eighteen years earlier. He trarnr8ed the country, going southward and westwal'd, awl crossed the rivers, but. found 110 traces of ci\'ilization short of the Rio Bravo. A few leag-11es westward of that river was the military post and mission of San Juan Bautista. St. Denis was received by the Spaniards witl1 kimlness. After Rome time lie passed on to Mexico to sc>ek an interview with the Vieero;r, who cordially eutertaiued propos~1ls, but stipulated that St. Denis on his return through Texas sl1ould eonduct some Spanish missiouaries who were to settle at different stations on the road. St, Denis left Mexico on the 26th of October, 1715, and crossed the territory of Texall hy the route followed in his advance. His Spanish companions in pa8sing made se\·eral little settlements amongst the A.days, the As:sina,y:s, and the Natchitoches in the vicinity of Red Ri\'er. On tbe 25th of August, 1716, St. Denis arrived at Mobile. Soon aftt>r otber settlers and troops were sent to re-enforce t.he posts founded by him and to estahlisll others. Memllaudise wiis packed for trade with the Spaniards on the Rio Bravo, and on the· 10th of October, 1716, the llarty of St. Denis again set out from Mobile for the journey to Mexico. .After reachiug I~ed River several missionary stations were visited. On the 21st of ,January, 1717, they werP at a Spanish "presidio," which was garrisoned by seventeen soldiers. Beyond Trinity Rinr tl1e~ pa.ssed the Rio Brazos, and on the 8th of April the Rio Colorado, on the 11th of Ma,v the nio Sau Marco, on the following day the Rio Guadalupe, and two days later they forded the Hio San An. tonio. The four days following were occupied in traveling 27 leagues to the Nueces Wn·r, aud on the 21st of April they arrived at the Rio del Nort. There the good,;; belonging to St. Deuis were seized by the Spaniards. He went to Mexico to clailll their restoration ; but Don Balta;mr, who had succeeded the Duke of Linares, put St. Denis in prison. He, however, escaJle1l aud

Crozat did not reap the advantage8 expected from his Louisiana grant; nor bad he auvauced the interests of the colon;v. Be therefore (in 1717) reuonuced his privileges, and Louis XV, of France, accepte1l his resignatiou. Then (August: 1717) the Western Com1>au;y was formed, and, under the direction of the noted speculator Law, the cornpau:y aimed at the control of the foreign and domestic commerce of France. The King granted to that corporation privileges more extern;ive than tho"e whic11 had been allowed to Crozat. They beld under his letters patent for twents-iive years the right to all lands, coasts, ports, llarborR, and islands pertaining to Louisiana, retaining for the Crown only fealt.y and homage. They were at liberty also to choose gornrnon;" aud officers for tbe command of troopR. Witliin the period specifie<l the company engaged to settle in the territory six thousand white persons and three thousand ueg·roes; to make efforts for the salYation of the Indian savages and ue!4roes; to build chapels and maintain religious teachers. Under this gTant three ships arrived at Dauphine Island in February, 1719, briugiug settlers, soldiec-s, aud goods for commerce with eolonists already settled on the Gulf shores. r,erno;yne de BienYille, a man of intluence, and popular in Louisiana, was nominated by the compauy as governor. He fitted out a party to mO\'e towards Saint Joseph's Ray, intending to make tl1ere a military post, as it was not far from Pemm· cola Bay. To Saint Joseph's, therefore, Bienville sent his brother with fift.Y soldiers in the year 1718. A fort was erected, and was left in command of M. de Gousy. But the Spaniards, iu 1mperior force, soon eompcllcd the surrender of the place, and the fort was destroyed. The name, and a tolerable re11resentation of Saint Joseph's Bay, ap11ear on the maps of tbe French geographer He L'Isle. Jn .August, 1717, a great storm inundated Dauphine Island and destroyed its ha1·bor hy masses of sand. This event necessitated a search for ship protection elsewhere. Bienville fon11d at last, thirty leagues from the Gulf, a place on the Lower Mississippi~ and in the year 1718 tilere built some houses and left men to clear tlle ground. On this i;ite subsequently arose the city of New Orleans. It was so named iu honor of the Bourbon Prince who was then regent of France. On the 19th of A11ril, 1719, M. De Serigny arrived with notice that war had been declared between France aml Spain. He brought a commission for exploring the coast of Louisiana in company with Biem·ille, and he was authorized to gain, if poi;siblc, possession of the Spanish fort at Pensaeula, as it defended the only good port on the E<hores of the Gnlf of Mexico. Pensacola was sm·prisP<l by Hien,·ille and Seriguy in May, 1719, hut in the following month it was retaken by a Hpauisb force from HaYaua. Somewhat later a French fket, u11der M. de Cbawpmes1in, captured the place; and thus in the course of six months Pensacola had changed masters three times. 111 the year L7!&0 a French astronomer of distinction was sent to Louisiana. This was :Father La,,al, professor of mathematics at Toulon. His observations were publisiled at Paris in 1728, and with them is included a plan of the harbor of Pensacola. Laval, in June, 1720, set np a.n obAervatory on Dauphin Island and observed for latitude. The result found was 370 17' 1" for hi8 place of ubseiTation, aml he says that be drew the coa11t line of the entire Gulf 13 minutes further south than it had been represented by earlier map mitkers.

St. Denis and Bernard de la Harpe had been sent to the French settlements at the north in the year 1719. This expedition of La Harpe was directed to ~ew MPxico, hut on hi!-' return iu January, 1720, to New Orleans he found that the Western Company had issued an order for the immediate settlement of Saint Bernard's Bay, which after the time of La Salle had not been entered by any French officer. Mr. Belisle, in 1717, had been left there, aud aft.er many adventures bad returned. Be was now reqlwsted to go under command of La Harpe to take possession of tJ1e ba.y. A small Yeissel, the "Subtile," with twenty l!len, wa8 aissigned to La Harpe, and he was named commandant of the Bay of Saint Bernard. He was to proceed without. delas and to take possession of the adjaceut country in the name of tbe company and the Kiug, am! to build a fort. Spanish settlers were to lw informed that the territory belonged to the King of France, in whose name Robert de la Salle had taken J>ossession twenty-five :vears before. Intruders were to he drh'en out b,y force. On the 16th of August, 1721, De la Harpe left Dauphin Island and sailed westwar(l ''for a hundred leagues or more." At all places where attempts were made to land the nati,·e;; were hostile. Be returned to Mohile and readied that place in the middle of October.
CHARLJ::HllX, 1i2'2.

In .January tlw .fosuit fat.lter 2 Uliarlm·oix arri\·ed from Uarn-ula, aurl to him lllUst be conceded a conspicuous place as an explorer aD1l as the hi:storian of earl_\· times iu the nortlwrn region of the Gulf of Mexico. He visited all the l·'rench settlements there and gaYe to the world the first reliable description of the eonntQ'· He passi>·l down the :\Iississippi aud at the month, in eompany with the French eugineer Pang·l·r, he sounded one of the passes. Suhsequeutly Charle. voix wa~ shipwrecked at the .Florida Keys, but escaped in a small boat and with it arrirnd at the Spanii,;b settlement at Saint Mark's. He then passed along the north coast of the Gulf to J,ouisiana, and finally returned to Fra.nce. The princi1)al centPr8 of acti\·it.Y fol' the Spaniards were Pemm-cola and Mexico. _From tbese stations the northern and eastern part8 of the <inlf cnast were explored, and travels were made toward Texas. That territor~· w:is, hmvernr, relinquished by Europeans in the ~·ear 1694, with the exception of Spanish mission stations aloug the Rio BraYo. In the :rear 1714 French ad,·eutnrers again appeared in Texas. If any movements Wl'Tl' made for exploration in the interval of twenty .rears, the re1mlts are not known. France and Spain being· at peace, trav<'l followed the routes hetween Vera Uruz, the delta of the Mississippi, Mobile, l'eusacola, and Ha\·aua. The mo..,eruents of St. Denis so arollRell the Spirnianls that the:y made alliance with the French discoverer, and sent Don Domiugo Ramon with some soldiers and Franciscan missionaries to accompany Saint Deuis toward the region watered by Red River. Several 1-!tations were chosen and provided with meaus for sustai11ing the missions. The province was then named by the l:'pan. iardR "Lax Kuevas Filipinas." The Marquis de Aguayo was the first royal gornrnor, and he entffe(i bis province in the :year 1716. Some years of peace were e11joyed, and for some time no expeditious, sucl1 as had been induced b;y wars in earlier times, were sent out. \Vith the !'avage .Apaclies arnl Comanche Indians the Spanish contended in the interior; but for the same period then· was 110 naval enterprise. The northwest parts of the Gulf coast were not explore<l untH the end of the eighteenth ceutmy, and Humboldt says (in 1812) they were "as unknown as tl1e coasts of Africa.'· In the year 1703 Don J nan de .Ayala, an actiYe alHi intelligent Spanish officer, who was well acquainted with matters in l·'lorida, suggested an expedition from Saint A ugustiue to tlle Gu If for the conquest of territory between tl1at place and Pensacola. His proposal was laid before one of the most distiuguisl1ed ministers of Spain, Don .Alonzo Carnero~ aml it inclmled tbe recommendation that some point on Appalachee Bay should be fortified. Ayala was appoiuted governor of Florida in 1718, and as no measures liad been taken on his earlier suggestion, he then or<lered au expedition to move from Saint Augustine toward the northeastern part of the Gulf, aud direded also the stnwture of a fort. The command of tbe expedition was giYell to Don ,Joseph Primo de Ribera, "a soldier of great experience and conrage, 11 and he was furnished with all re<1uisites for building a fort in the region inhabited hy Indians at Appalacbee. A \"e8t"el with pr~visions was sent from Saint Augustine to assist in the operations. Ribera set out by land on the 20th of February, 1718, and arrived at the head of the bay in advance of the ship. He immediately began the con.

struction of a fort, and mtmed it Saint Mark's, but the party was soon in want of supplies, a.;; the vessel llid not arrive at the time expected. Some soldiers were therefore sent to Peusacola to ask aid from Don Juau Pedro Matamoras, aud provisions were sent by that officer in a little coasting vessel. Meanwhile the ship of .Ayala arrh·ed at Saiut Mark's. Bienville (goniruor of Louisiaua) had recalled hi8 commander at Saiut .Joseph's Bay, as that station was desolate. The greater part of the garrii:;on had previously deserted to the Spaniardt<, and the remnant reached Mobile in a little vessel ou the 26th of ,July, 1718. The Spanish commander at Pensacola sent a few soldiers to take possession of the bay and build a fort. lioldan, who led that force, found the French defenses in ruin, but he promptly restored it and made a sun·ey of the vicinity at the end of the year 1718. Iu the following year re-enforcements came from Mexico under Don Gregorio de Salinas, to construct fortiticatious upon a larger i;cale at Saint Joseph's Ba,r, and soon afterwards the coast of the peninsula from Pensacola to Saint· Augustine was explored. Thence onward, in the cotuse of time, parts of the Gulf coast were visited by Euglish, French, and Spaniards, and local settlements were founded. In the year 1846 the United States Coast Survey commenced geodetic operations iu the Gulf of Mexico, and in subsequent years latitude, longitude, and the magnetic elements have been determined at many stations. Tides and current8 have been observed, and the configuration of the Hulf bottom is now as well known as tliat of the surfaee of an,y part of the adjacent territory. The geological strueture of the Flori1la l~eefs and Keys was inYestigated by the late Professor Louis Agassiz, whose report on the subject is given in the printed annual report of the survey for the year 1851. In other volumes will be found in detail the mentiou of developments matle iu the progress of the work on land and afloat.

UNITED ST.ATES COAST AND GEODETIC SCIWEY.
INTRODUCTION.

In Septem lwr, ];)13, Balboa, frnrn tlie heights of Parnmrn, disco\'ered the Pacific Ocean; and in 1530, Magellan, sailing tln·ough the strait that bears his name, saw tl1e same ocean at a more southern point. The record of these resolute men closes abruptly. Balboa was beheaded in 1514 by order of l'e<lro Arias de Avila. and Magellan was killed in a contest with savages at the Philippine Islands. The immediate succrssors of the navig·ators just named occupird themselves more particularly with the western coast of South .America, where they found the empire of Peru, supposed to be rich in gold, and 110 one thought of adYa11cing north ward until 1532, when Cortes turned attention to the north west. Thus for a period of forty years (1492-1532), during which the eastern and western coasts of South America bad been circumnavigated, and imperfectly laid down on maps, and the eastern shore of North .America explored b,r Spaniards, hy .English, and hy the French, and the River St. Lawrence traced inland to a distance of 600 miles, oue 11uarter of the coast remained unknown to Europeans. Large scope was left for the speculations of cosmographers and their views were wild and various. Some supposed that nu continent existed, and that the lands found, as Florida, New France, T1abrador, Grcl:'ul1wd, &c., were only the extremities of large islands. As such they are represented ou early maps. But, most men then li\'ing believed that North .America was a large peninsula connected with Asia. Columbus himself so thought at one time. The laud was snppose,d to stret~h over into Asia from that part of Central .America which was ma<le known by :Balboa and bis successors, and by the first expeditious of Cortes; while Mexico, China, and Tbibet, were represented as neighboring States. The Tartar nomads, with their herds of cattle, were supposed to wander in what we now call ''The Buffalo Couutr.Y," and the Empire of Japan was judged to be where California actually is. But, step by 8tep, such notions gave place to \'iews nearer the truth. In the course of t\vo ceuturies, .Japan, China, and the nomadic Tartars were gradually referred into plaee, and the great Pacific ex1Janse between Asia and America widened to something like true proportion. The prevailing notions of the time had great practical influence. Cortes and Mendoza sailed by charts erroneously constructed, just as Columbus hacl been guided by a ma}J of the Italian, Toscanelli, when be disCO\'ered America. Expeditions intended for disco\'ery along the northwestern coa£t were instituted merely becam1e .Japan and China were supposed to be in that neighborhood.

1532-1579, .
In his third letter to the Emperor Charles V, Cortes state8 that .Montezuma informed him tha.t an ocean P-xisted west of Mexico. Of the explorers sent out by the Spanish commander, some reached the Pacific in the neighborhood of Acapulco, at a point about 10 degrees northwest of the summit from which Balboa saw the ocean. Others went further in that direction to explore a.i1d conquer the kingdom of Mechoacau and Oolima. The last brought back intelligence respecting au island rich in pearls and gold and inhabited only by a race of Amazons. The Indians of l\Iechoacan asserted that some of their tribe had visited the island and that it lay at a distance of ten days sail from Colima. Oort{.~S relates this in his fourth letter t-0 the Emperor, dated October 15, lli:)4; and it was probably the first notice received in Spain concerning California. Cortes hoped to find it st.rait i,mpposed to exist somewhere south of Yucatan, and in that direction be sent Captain Pedro Alvarado, who reached Guatemala in 1545. Thither were dispatched t.hc first Rhips built hy his order on the Pacific coast, and when be marched to Honduras it was to the same quarter that the steps of Cortes were turned. When of necessity his purposes in that direction were abandoned, active attention was turned to the northwest, but probably one reason for U1e change turned upon the fact that Nuno de Guzman, in 1530, conducted an expedition along the Saint Jago Rirnr, with a view of conquering the kingdom of Mechoacan. The river then known as the Saint Iago is the largest in Mexico. It runs in a northwestern dir<>rtion, and empties into the Pacific not far from the entrance of the Gulf of California, and t.his may be considered as the ea.rliest embarkation of Spaniards for the northwest. Guzman was the

first who saw the coa8t opposite to the ro('kY peniusula of Ualifornia. In hi;; rqiort to the Emveror he mentions a peo1ile Raid to he Jiyiuf:· nt the west in a conntQ· fiUITotmded hy the ocean, a1Hl thh> intel!igeuce, coutirming preYious ruuwri<, 11robably gaye rist· to t11e mariti11w ex1Jeditio111< ::;cut thither by Cortes two years atforwards.

The first expeditimi to that regiou was unfortuuate and produced uo rt>sult. It wa8 com· mantled by Diego Hurtado Mendoza, a relath·e of Cortes, who \\itb two shi11s sailed from Acapulco on the 30th of <Tune, 1532. He was instructed to proceed northwest, ex1>lore the western coast of New Spain, and to discoYer, if possible, those "isla11d8 of the ocean," rich in pearls, aud inhabited li.Y .Amazons, of which Cortes had been informed. This \O,yage may therefore be considered as the first Californian ex11e<lition, tlwugb it is doubtful wbetl1er l\Iendoza ever reached tliat countrj·. But, pursuing the course indicated, l1t· tli8eoverecl 8everal harbors, and tbe. islands "las tre.s Marias," in latitude 27° 02' N. When his }lrovisio11s were much reduced bis crew revolted, aml l1e 8ent back oue of bis vessels with the sick and discoutente1l. Nothing more is known of this unfortunate chief or of his companions. Tlle returning shiIJ was wrecked on its passage, and the few wl10 siuYived that 1Iii:-aster were imprisoued by Nuflo de Guzman, wlw was then gonrnor of the uortbwestern coast of New Spain and tlie implacable enemy and rival of Cortes. Tile report of tlwse misfortunes was aH the information l'l·ceived h;v Cortes relative to the hapless t>Yperimeut. Niwarret.e, in his introduetiou to the work entitled "Uelacion del viage hedw par las Goletas, Sutil y Mexicana en l'l afio de 1792, Madrid, 180:.!, pagf' 11 et seq.," gives some particulars of this voyage.
CALIFORNIA. 15:J:V:J4.

When Cortes ileanl of the lm·8 of lii8 vessels he resolYed on a second attempt; and ha!'lteued to the harbor of Tehuantepec to hasten the outfit of the Goncq1tio11. and San Lazaro, whieh ves81!h; be placed in charge of Diego Becerra and Bernaudo de Grijalva, with directions to pursue tlw course indicated for their predPcessorl'<; and at the same time t-0 make diligeut Reareb for the missing captain Meudoza. On the 30th of Octolwr, J[i33, the two \'essels sailed, but were iwpara.ted 1.Jy a storm on the second night of tlleir vo;yag·e. Gi·ljah'a in the San Lazaro, a11xious to rPjoin his Chief Becerra, sought him in various directions. Ile went southward to mo liorth latitude; and more tlrnn 100 leagues west of tbe coast of New Spain, an island was discovered and named Santo Tomas. One north of it be named Los Inocentes. These, are now known as the Revilla Gigedo Islands. Finding no trace of his commander, Grijalva returned, and was snbsequentl.r emploJed l1y Cortes in exploring other parts of the coast of New Spain. l\Ieauwhile, Becerra, the chief of the expedition, seems to have 1mrsued l1is course to the umtl1 west, but uot far. ·while yet on the coaist of ~ew Spain, he was murdered by his crew, who joiued in a eonspiracy against him untler the chief pilot Fortun Ximenez. The pilot assumed coimuaml, reached the coaRt uear the harbor now called La Paz, and as far as known was the first European who set foot on that soil. Soon after he was attacked by the natives and himself and twent~··two of bis men were kiJled. The rest of tlie crew returned to New Spain, and at XMliseo were captured by Guzman and robbed. Little i8 kuown with certainty of the proceedings of Becerra and his pilot Ximenez. It is difficult to fix exact)~· tlle date of arrival of the first European vessel on the coast of California.
CALIFORNIA, 1535'-:!6.

Tile land reached by :Fortun Ximenez was supposed by Cortes to be situated between l\lexico and the Moluccas, and possibly in tile neighborliood of the cl'lebrated Spice falands. Full of expectation, and desirous of searching again for bis rnissiug relati\'e (Diego Hurtado) a new enterprise was planned, and Cortes 1leterrnined to command it in person. lu hope of finding another country like Mexico, aud also to be }>rt>parl'd agaiust ltis host.ile neighbor, Guzman, a force equal to that with which he had oouquered Mexico was assembled b,\· Cortes.

On the point of embarkation a ditlicnlt,v arose, that seems not to ]rnYe bt·e11 foreHPlm either l1y UorteH or his companions. 'l'he tl1ree YesselR, namel,r, the Santa .Aguida1 S:rn J,:1zaro, and Sm1to Thomas prov-ed hardy snfticient for the trarrnportatiou of a third part of the eompauy, encuuibered as it of necessity was, with horses, canoes, impl('ment1<, and proYisions needful for war aJJd for the settlement of a colony. Cortes, however, set sail from the harbor of Chiltmetlan on the 15th of April, 1535, bonn<l for the place where the pilot Ximenez and his crew had been slain. Without difficult.r the situation wai,; identified. On the 1st of l\fay Cortes saw tlie mountains of California, and named them Las Sierras de Sau Felipe, and also an island, which he named Santiago. Two da;ys after the part;r reached tl1e rle;:;ired luwen, where the remains of the unfortunate Xime11es were still to be sel~JJ. 'l'he lmy iu whicl1 this port was situated thp~· uamed Baia de Smita Cruz. 111 after years it was sometimes called the Bay of Cortei,;, and also the Bay of California. This last name, from whence deri\·ed we know 11ot, was fi1ially apvlied to the whole couiltry.· These fow name8; facts, and dat<'S eon taiu all the reliable information we lrn>e bearing upou the history of discoyery. The remaining records of the ex1wllition mention only shivwreck and disaster. It cannot be asserted that Cortes rliscovered any part of tlie coast north of the bay alw,·e mentioned; 11or is it known how far uortli he went into the Californian gulf. H<' did not succeed iu transporting the rei,;t of bis anuy and stores to California, though he made several attempts, and in person he at once returned to New Spaiu for that purpose. The ships dispatched b_y him gencrnll_y failed to rcacl1 their destination; one witl1 proYisions arrind near tl1e coast, and 'rns beaten back to the disap1iointment of t11e men left on the peninsula, who suffered from hunger and disease, while the arms marched lmndreds of miles along the shore looking in vain for tbe lost ,·essels. Cortes, m·er active, encountere1l mauifold pnils and misfortunes on the gulf, which in llis time wa1> called tl1e "Sea of Cortes,n but was able to transport 011l_y a !'man supply of provisions from tlie coast of Mexico to relie\·e his famishing soldiers at the Ba;y of the Hol_y Cross. In the mi<lst of t,hcRe difficulties he was sumrnoued to Mexico. The arrival of his sncceissor, the Vicero~y Don Antonio de :Mendoza, an<l other affairs of importance made his return desirable; but unwilling to relinquish his Californian enterprise, and contemplating another expeditiou, Cortes left a small force under the command of Francisco Ulloa. Meanwhile a report wa8 circuhlted in :Mexico that Cortes bad been lost at sea on oue of his Yoyages, and great auxiet,y was expressed for bis safety. This, and a threatened insurrection of the Mexican Indians, induced the Vicero_y, Mendoza, to send a vessel in search; and Donl!la Juana de Zuniga, the wife of Cortes, iu her extreme solicitude, dispatched ships for the same pur1wise. These were all met by the returning chieftain, who earl_y iu 1536 entered the harbor of Aca1mlco at the bead of a fleet of six ships.
CALIFORNIA, ln39-'40.

Cortes, on hiK return to .Mexico, found much to do. .After S('ttling his affairs with the new Viceroy, hP was called npou to as:sist the Spaniards in Peru, who were then menace.d by a general reYolt of the l utlians. The little force left at the Bay of Santa Cruz under the command of l·'r:mcisco de Flloa was in consequence withdrawn. · 'l'he decree which removed Cort<'s from the viceroyalty, constituted him "Admiral of the l'acitic,'~ with command of all tbe ports and naval force, and reserved to him the special right of discowry arnl conquest. Thus endowed for the prosecution of l1is pnrposes, lie delegat.ed the c-0mmmHl to Ulloa, and on tlie 8th of Jul.r tl1at officer isailetl from .Acapulco on what prove1l to he, as far :t.. 'I n·gards geographical discoYery, the most important and successful of all the l1Xpe<litions of Oortes. A complete r<·port of the voyage of Ulloa, written by Francisco Preciado, one of his pilots, was printed h~· Ramusio. Hakluyt trauslated it i11to E11glish and inserted it in his "Third and last .,-olume of the vo_yages, navigations, and discoveries of the English nation. London, 1600."

But to liis disappoiutmrnt he fou11tl fresl1 water at the lieau of the gulf~ and the countr;y aromid tlte Rio Colorado being tl1en a low sands plain, it was not easy to decide wbere the waters of tbe sPa ernled or those of the river began, or eYen to discern betwecu land and water in the dh;tauee. From a small sand l1ill be could see ouly tlie rin·r aml uu uuin\·itiug stretch of land, although some of tlle party were of the opiuion that a narrow outlet could be traced kalling to a sea be;yond. The rt·port of Ulloa left in doubt tlie real 11ature ot the 11e11immla. Sir Fraucis Dralu:>, in 1i:i77, regarded it ns an il>land. From the Lead of the gulf, {;Hoa coa!'\ted the eastern 1:1ide of tl1e 1w11insula of Lower California, aud carefully examined each irnle11tation, Loping to find a passage.

He ueyer rettir11eu to America after liis departure for Spain iu 153!.l. 'rhe Yfcero~-, Mendoza, was ilms left without a competitor in the broad field of adwnture. GoYernor of Mexico and Admiral of the Pacific, lie aYailed llimself of Lis powerful 1>osition to hecome a promoter of the most importaut discoYeriei; of the sixtee11th century. Circumstances combined to induce 1\Iendoza to imrsue explorations in the course opened by Cortes. It was uot, in his time, certaiu that the Gulf of California was closed at the north, and tllt>re was a lingering liope that it might afford a l>llssage to Chiua. T!Jat tlie nature of tLis gulf "should he hrougl1t thorn11ghls to light" was tbt>refore au early subject of :Mendoza's atte11tion. Some land travelers had reached tl1e northwest and returned witb accounts of tlie ricl1es and advantages of the country. Of these the most uotewortby were Ah·ar Nuiiez Cabe9a de Yaca and tlie monk llarcos de Niza. De Vaca, an officer in tbe unfortunate expedition wbich sailed from :Xagua ou the 20tl1 ofF!'h· ruary, 1528, under Narvaez, had, iu the course ofnearl.Y ten years, traversed the Gulf coast between Florida, fron! whence he set out, and some point west of the Delta of the Mississippi, autl after roaming o''er mountains and plaius bad reaclled tlle sliores of the Pacific ill tlie year 15~H. Attracted by the relation of what De Vaca had seen in bis wanderings and encouraged by Mendoza, the f'raucisciu1 rnouk, Marcos de Niza1 in compauy with oue of the (\Olllpanions of De Vaca, started ou foot in March, 1538, for further exploratio11s. But, nen with the aid of bis journal, the route tmveled caunot be certainly made out, uor the localities identified that are in his report made the subject of 1·omtmct> and exaggeration. Be asserted tliat be liad been north of Mexico and that he had crossed a rich couutrJ· and an em11ire called" Uibola," tbe metropolis of which was as large and brilliant as tl1e city of ~iexieo. I~efore au altar erecterl in a lonely forest he secretly with some ceremony "took i·oi:session " of this empire and called it the "New Kiugdom of Sau Francisco." Niza moreover declared that.Le bad discowred in the heart of the new world the fabulous "seven cities," so often sought in vain by the ancit·nts amon~st the islands of the Atlantic. Noth· ing was too imp1·obable for the excited imaginations of bis countrymen. They at ouce laitl down

on maps, side by side, tbe famom; kingdom of Cibola 11nd tbe fabulous seven cities. l'alaces roofed with sih'er and temples glitte.riug witb gold were items which adorned the descriptious in common discourse. After the return of tbe monk to Mexico, Venegas says (Noticia, pp. 163, 164) "Rver~'llOdy in this city spoke of nothing but Cibola ancl the seYen cities, aud pretended that all the best thing·s and the greatet-lt richPs of the world wPre to be found them.'' The Goveruor of Guatimala, Dou Pedro AJyarado, as well as the Viceroy of Mexico, uow began to prepare new expeditions for this field of researeb. Captain Buruey in his History of Discovery in the South Sea; London, 180:3, vol. 1, page 193, :says that the retui u of the monk .Niza and bis exciting narration stirred. up Cortes and gave ri:se also to the expedition of Ulloa, wbieb he there· fore relates after Niza's report. This is doubtles8 a mistake. Niza left Uuliacan in March, 15;19 (the date ginm by Burney on page 189), and after wauderiug a ;year at the north be could not have returned to :Mexico before the beginniug of 1540. rlloa sailed early in July, 1539, and so Captain Burney statt·s on J>age HH. Bis Yo;yage, therefore, should have bern H·cmmteu before that of Niza, and caunot be reasonably considered as a consequeuee of that. expeuitiou. 'L'he same error bas been repeated hy subsequent writers. Ah'arado collected a fleet, and made an agreemeut with Mendoza to combine their forces for discoYery and conquest in the northwest. The armament was to be under the command of Alvarado, but, the sudden death of that officer in 1541 stopped the undertaking, and the fleet was dispersed.. Mendoza bad mea11wl1ile completed the array of a milit:ir~' force designed to follow the track of the monk Niza and conquer the kingdom of Cibola, and to "explore the secrets" of the Gulf of California. This expedition consisted of two divisions, one to proceed by land the other b~· sea. Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, GoYernor of the uorthv.-esteru province of New Galicia, was placed at the head of the former, witl1 orders to marcl1 through Sinaloa and Sonora, while H eruando de Alarcon, in command of the marine force, isbould sail along the shores. Both compauies set out at the same time iu the spriug of 1540, and their departure was coincident with the return of Ulloa's men from the west. Alarcon, who sailed from Acapulco on the 9th of May with the ships San Pedro aud Santa Cata liua, completed awl extended the discoveries made by Ulloa at the north of the Gdlf of Califomia. "Because [he writes to Mendoza] your highness has commanded me to bring you, at all fwenta, the mystery of this gulf, I determined not to leave until I had thoroughly explored the i1111er111ost recesses of it:s waters." He therefore entered the river which Ulloa bad only seen afar off, aud sailed up its stream in boats for fifteen days, always Loping to find tl1e rich "kingdom of Uit.ola" and to meet Coronado, with whom he was to co-operate. l >isappointed iu both of his objects, Alarcon returned to his ships, which la~' at the mouth of the Sacramento, after having traversed 85 leagues of the course of the river with great difficulty. Near the entrance he erected a chapel in honor of the "Senora de la buena Guia" (our lad.Y of the Good Guide), and called the country "La Campana de la <Jruz." Alarcon discovered also the mouth tlf the river Gila, a great branch ot' the Colorado, and named it Brazo de Miraflores .. He remarks that the "me11 of the marques," alluding to :Franci>ico de Ulloa, were mistaken in fixing tbe latitude of the head of the Oalifornfa.n ,gulf, placing it 2 d(,grees too far north, and that he bad himself beeu 4 degrees further iu that direction tbnn an~· who preceded him. At the end of the year 1540 Alarcon returned to Mexico. Coronado waR meanwhile engaged in bis land jourues. Until the year 1838 uotbing had been published coneerniug his expedition, excepting the short report in Hamusio's Vol. III, and occasional allusions to it iu Herrera and Gomara. At that time, however, M. Teruaux Compans gave to the public a full a<:cou11t, written liy Pedro de Castaneda de Nagera, one of the companions of Uoronado. In April, 1540, Corouado set out from Ouliacan, then the most northern i::;panish town in Mex· ico, and the depot of laud expeditions, as Acapulco was for those by sea. His army consisted of abo>e six hundred Spaniards and many Indians, besides a number of enterprising young noblemen, the flower of Spanish chivalry in Mexico. The llrray is mentiont>d by old writers as one of tbe most complete and brilliant of the time. '\Vltb tl1is imposing retinue Co1onado took his c-0111se tlnough the country east of the Cali·

fornian gulf: .At a considerable river, whicb they called Rio Tizon, they turned towardH iti-; ltcad "aud traversed promising countries and some deserts." The route of the army can be approximately traced. It is evident that the course was in the vicinity of the Gila aud acros1> the ,·alley of the Rio BraYo towards the plains east of the Rocky .Mountain1;. The buffalo bunts, tlte g('(J. graphical foatures of the plains of the Upper Arkant>as and Hcd Hivers, their extent and baneu nature, even the long deep crevices into which the buffaloes as well as the ho1'8c8 of Co1'011ado sometimes tell headlong, are so minutely described by Castaneda, that there can be uo doubt in regard to the region crossed by this party. Castaneda observes that the rivers which they saw probably emptied into tile great river Espiritu Santo, cliscovere<l by De Soto; that is, into the Mississir>pi. Early in .April, 1543, the army retraced its course, and reached Mexico at the end of the summer. "Our enterprise" says Castaneda, ''took a wrong course. \-Ve looked for Quivira on the desert plains of the northeast, bnt the rich Quivira or Great India lies toward the northwest. This is now quite clear from the sea expedition of Villalobos, who examined the coast of the Pacific and found Great lndia in that direction." Some early writers mention Quivira as bounded by the Pacific, and assert that Coronado's company saw strange sl1ips having on their prows images of birds wrought in gold aud Hil rnr, and la-<len with merchandise supposed to have been btonght from China. Castaneda ~mys that the Yessels so ornamented were only canoes, and that he was so informed by the Imlians who asimred him that they were common on a certain river in the interior. Gomara erroneously jullged that the water mentioned might be the western ocean, and from that ttme" Quivira" was marked ou nearly all contemporaneous maps in the position occupied b.Y San Francisco Bay. Ou some maps it is marke<l as being north of that bay. Cabrillo, sailing along the coast in the autum, of 1542, was repeatedly told by the savages t.liat other Spaniards were traveling in the interior, and with these he tried to put himself in communication. He beard of them for the last time at .Juan de Capistrauo. It was reasonable to suppose that the party were Coronado and his followers. Castaneda says that the Knight Melchoir Diaz, with a number of men, peuetrated beyond the Colomdo River. .According to tllat writer, Diaz was left by Coronado in charge of a fortified station on the route, but full of the spirit of adventure he delegated the command of tue quiet station, and set off at the head of twenty-five chosen men for exploration towards the coast. After reaching the Rio Tizon he traveled along the southern bank. Indians told him of the ships of Alarcon, and showed him the place of embflrkatiou, where Diaz found a tree with the inscription : ''Alarcon came as far as this place; there are letters undemeath." From the letters Diaz learned that the sea of Cortes was an iuclosed gulf, and that A.larcon, after some time wait.ing the arrival of Coronado, bad returned to Mexico. The Knight Melchoir Diaz crossed the Colorado on rafts constructed with the help of Indians, and struck into the interior of what is now known as the Colorado Desert. Bow far the party advanced before reaching that desolate region is not known. They describe it as being "cO\'ered with hot ashes that seemed here and there to boil in fierce agitation." The ground trembled under their feet, and the aspect of the place was forbidding. They found no water and turned for the starting· point. On the route Diaz was killed by an unfortunate accident. Expeditions to the sea. ·of Cortes were no longer thought of. Ulloa. as well as Alarcon had reported it landlocked; Il() doubt remained, and it is represented as a gulf on all the cllarts of the sixteenth century. The next party sent \'tut by .Mendoza proceeded therefore to the outside of the peninsula. Two vessels, the San Salvador and La Victoria, under command of the Portuguese pilot .J uau Rodriguez Cabrillo, left the port of N avidad, Mexico, on the 27th of June, 1542, and sailed along the coast as far as it ha.cl been previously explored by Ulloa; that is, to the Isle of Cedros and Uallo Engano where they arrived on tbe 20th ofAug.ust. From theuce, advancing more successfully than their predecessors, against adverse winds and currents, Cabrillo reached higher latitudes. At :34° north he saw not far from the coast an inconsiderable grou.p of desert islands (unas isl as desiertas ), and near them a harbor, which he called Puerto de San Miguel. The islands are now known as "The Coronados," and the port was doubtless San Diego. The latitudes assigned by the Spaniard H. Ex. 43--70

for tl~se places are not correct, but in every iustance (excepting at Cape San Lucas) the latitudes of Cabrillo are in error about a degree and a half. On the 7th of October Cabrillo saw two islands, which he named after his vesse18 San SalYador and La Victoria. They are now called San Olenwnte and Sauta Catalina. Beyond these he entered a hay to whicll he gave the name of Baia de :Fumos, perhaps tlie same that is now known as San Pedrn Bay, aud passing several other islauds ou the way, he sailed through what is at present designated thr Santa Barbara Chaunel; Point Conception was named b;v him Cabo de G-alern, and was placed more than a degree and a baJf too far uorthward. Stormy weather dela,ved 1irogre8s, and at length drove him some distance southward, where he discovered an islaud which he name'l San Lucas. The island is now called San Bernardo. A harbor eastward of the cape g:ave his party shelter, and received the appellation of Todos Santos (San J,uis Obispo), and auother, that or Puerto de las Sardinas, which is pnbaps the place now know11 as San Simeo11. Uabrillo tinally doubled the cape and along the coast made careful search, says Herrera, "for thQ Rio de Nuestra Senora, which, however, they could not tind." At 37 ~o nol'th latitude, according to Oabrillo, a range of lofty mountains was in view, probably tlie Californian coast rauge, named by him Sierra de Saint :Martin. On the 17th of November the voyagers entered a ba~·, supposed to be the Bay of l\fonterPy. They called it Bahia de los Pinos. In latitude 38° 40' of tl1eir reckoning (about 37° north in reality) tlJey saw a pr~jecting spit of land, to which tl1ey gave. the name.Caho de la Nieve-tbe snow cape. That cape is supposed t-0 be Punta aiio Nue.-o. In a storm which separated the two ships for several days Oabrillo was carried considerably northward, and saw, at a distance, another cape (probably Point Arena), and that was the highest latitude attained hJ- the party. Sickness, conjoined with cold and stormy weather, induced him to return as far south as the island of San Lucas (8an Bernardo), where he bad found a tolerably good harbor. This he reached on the 23d of November, 1542, but Oabrillo soon after fell sick. He died on the 3d of January, 1543, leaving the command of the expedition to bis first pilot Bartolome Ferrelo, or Ferrer. Ferrclo aud his companions soon felt the want of provisions, and 011 the 19th of January they left the harbor to search for provisions and wood. In stormy weather, which was continuous, they touched at several points on the main, and at the Santa Barbara Islands, but finally retired to their winter quarters. In a second attempt at sea they were carried far to the southwest, where tl1Py discove1·ed "some other desert islands, great and small." These were doubtless the Sandwich Islands. Still harassed by tempests the vessels were turned north, intending to make for the Bay of .Moutcre,r, hut were carriPd beyond it-Herrera saJ·s to the 44tb parallel of north latitude, where they Haw the mouth of a large river. This was the highest latitude reached by .Ferrelo. l:ltormH were frequent, and the cold was excessive. He was thus forced to turn to the southward. Sonw of his company died ; others were ill, and the able-bodied were on the point of starvation, "ouly a 15ca11t,\ supply of spoilt oiscuit" remained. Thus crippled, he returnecl to Mexico with the remnant of his party. '!'here has been some difference of opinion with regard to the latitude reached by this expedi· tio11. If the 440 north, quoted by Herrera (probably from the jQurnah1 of Oabrillo and Ferrelo), was actually obsen-e<l by them, and if it is true, as asserted by Navarrete, that they were always in error by one degree and a half, it is fair to conclude that 42~o north latitude was the limit in latitude. Ferrelo, ou h ii' homeward pmssage, probably saw Oape Mendocino. That name d9eS not appear in his report, but the position corresponds with that of a headland which he named "Caho de

Fortunas."
Nothing in the hiHtor,v of tbese voyages as drawn from the reports of Cbbrillo and Ferrelo indicates that either of those navigators entered the Bay of San Francisco, though they seem to have passed near its entrance several times. They certainly bad no knowledge whatever of the great harbor to which the opening at the. Golden Gate conducted. :Fcrrelo reached Mexico with both of bis ships after a passage of six weeks along the coast of California. On the first of March he was on the northern limit of his voyage, and on tbe 14th of April he entered the port of Navidad. ·

\Vith the exceptfou of Alarcon, all the chief's of naval expeditions sent to California by Cortes and :Mendoza had died or were lost, at sea in the voyages. Only remnants of their iiartiei;; returne1l with appalling accounts of storms and dangerR encountered in frozen regions and on desert coasts. It is therefore no wonder that zeal for California exploration leFselled, aud that a long pause ensued unmarked by any similar attempt; that "tile 110rth is cold, rough, mid 1wor'' becarue an adage amongst Spaniards; and tlieir horror of that r1·gion wai;; deP1w1wtl hy 1he retn1·11 of a remnant of De Soto's expedition in the same year with that of l·'errelo, 1543. The Rnfierers who surviveu the lrnrdships of travel came back froru the interior ai'tPr seeking Yainly for three years the fabulous Quivira, as others had sougl1t an e>er-receding Eldorudo. Such. failures, of course, checked the fervor of discovery. Riclies and ernvloyroent nem·er home were offered by the silver mines of Mexico, which disclosed abundant treasure, au<l at leni"th attention was drawn to the advantage of settling and improYing territory instead of merely plundering it. It was the avaricious spirit of the age that 8ent Cahrillo, Corouado, aud De Soto so far to the north. 1Vhen we co118ider that the Sp:miarfls had in their Earlier enterprises reached tbe fortieth parallel of latitude on thB eastern coa8t, it may be said that in aharnloning expeditions on the Pacific const tlie;v relinquished North Amnica; uot onl~y tlw shoiies lmt al;;o tlte interior. But, considering the im1ierf~ct state of the art of navigation in the period here under re,~iew, it is reniarka!Jle that so much was accomplished in t be wny of geographical flevelopmenL Moreover, Jortuue at the same period beckoned over quiet seas with favoring· breezes toward the coast of Asia. Instead of heavy galei;; and a tempei;;tuous ocpan. the trade-wirnls invited mn·igators to the east. Cortes, tl1e conqueror of Mexico, had sent out. expedition8 to the Old World, and Mendoza liad also dispatched one under Villalobos in tl1e year 154'.l, and wlien, soon after tl1e middle of the century, the Philippine Islands were acquired hy Miguel de Leinispi, a lucratiYe commerce was established between Mexico and .Asia, the respectiYe 11orts being.Acapulco and Manilla. Many vessels sent westward from New Spain had attempted to return over the hroad Pacific. but without success. Sailmg too far south in latitude the trade-winds werP agaiirnt them, and it was not until tbe time of' Legaspi's expedition tliat tbe prevalence of wiud8 north of tl1e tropics was discovered. The first vpssel tlrnt took adYantage of these wind8 for returning from Asia to New Spain a1}pears to have been the San Lucas, one of Legaspi'R flt>et, tl1at <kF:erted him in coJJRequence of the disaffection of the captain all{} pilots. :From l\'1indam1s tl1at ship ke.pt a Hortherly . course, and reached the .American coast nPar Cape Mendociuo, and from thence coasting alongOalifornia arrived at New Spain. Of the !'ame fleet another vei>sel, le Capitano Srm Pedro, took that course from the Philippine lslauds under command of Father Andres de UrdanPta, who carefnll~ kept a journal, made observations, aud gave the re1mlts on a chart which served as a guide in subsequent voyages. Somewhat above the 40tb parallel Urdaneta bad met the northwest winds, and 8ailed with them, as the San Lucas had clone alo11g tlie. coa8t of California to the shores of New Spaiu, where lw arriYed t11ree months later. Burney sa,,rs that the chart of the Northern Pacific by Unlaueta was in use among Spaniards in 1623. Soon after the disco>ery of this route a regular and profitable intercourse was organized between Mexico and Asia; and tbere is little doubt that tbis circumstance turned the tide of Spanish navigation again into its usual direction from east to west. Hence these excursions to the north may be considered as exceptional de,'iatious. Amongst olher camies conjoining to thiH result was the progress of the Portuguese in the northeast part of Asia. They bad reaC'Led China as early as 1530, and probably -visited Japan a few years after. In the latter part of the sixteenth century there-was apparently a pause in tlrn march of euterprise at the north and at the south. California and Chili were no loJlger arenas of rt>S<:'arcl1, arnl some discoveries of early date were forgotten. SoJDe even questioned the existenee of t11e Strait of Magellan. The Spaniardl'I at that time were in quiet pmisession of the Pacific Ocean as a great highway for richly laden galeons tha~ passed frcm the New World to tbe Old, gatheriug the wealth of both, and they feared lest their advantage might be Jost. When, therefore, Sir Francis Drakt' enfiered the Pacific Ocean the Spaniards were aroused as by a thnnderstroke·

The interval between Oabrillo's expedition and the renewed spirit of adYentnre was, as usual in snch cases, filled with fabulous tales of impossible voyages. Some instances will be mentioned: A Portuguese ;,;ailor, named :Martin Chackc or Chaque, was said to have sailed in 1555 from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean at the north of California, and to have reached the western waters in latitude 59 degrees north. Arnln~s de Urdaneta, before alluded to, a mariner well known in Spain, was reported to have gone from the South Sea. to the Atlantic in 1556,-'57, circumnavigating the countries called California aml Florida; and another Spaniard, Juan :Fernandez de Ladrillero, in 1574, pretended that he bad certain kuowledge of the existence of a passage north of California and Florida; that he bad heen at the entrance of the strait, and could have easily gone through it if. the condition of his ship had uot forced him to return home. These reports are not worthy of critical inquiry as to their origin and history, having but sligl1t relation to the coasts with which we are now concerped. · Navarrete gives, for the curious, ample details in regard to the spurious reports.

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE, 1579 .

English aud French seamen and privateers had for more than half a century contentetl themsekes with phrndering Spanish colonies on the eastern side of America, but at length a bold adve11turer extended his system of. war and pillage into the Pacific. Drake fitted out, partly at his own cost and partly by the aid of private gentlemen and companies, a fleet of five small vessels. At the outset his flag-ship was named The Pelican, and the commander was, in a certaiu sense, commissioned by Queen Elizabeth. The expedition left Bughuid in December, 1577, sailed on the track of Magellan, and passed through the strait named after that nadgator. There Drake changed the name of his principal ship, calliug it The Golden Hind, and towards the end of 1578, with only two other vessels in company, he entered the South Pacific Oceall. Soou after the two vessels separated from the fiag·ship, and Drake continued the yo:yage alone in The Golden Hind. In the spring of 1579 he sailed along the western coast of South and Central America, capturing and burning Spanish ship8, and plundering some of the Spanish settlements. Laden with spoil, his vessel at length reached the harbor of Gnatulco, but again pnt to sea on the 16th of April, t>.tecring boltll.Y into the Pacific on a course west and northwest for 1,400 leagues without seeiug any laud. Hii,; probable intention was to circumnavigate the continent of North America and return eastward to Europe. Such design is not stated in the account of Drake's vo:rage, but the opinion then generally held, that America could lte circumnavigated through an open sea or strait at the north, as it had been at the south, strengthens the. probability of the supposition. Geograpi.Jern of that period gave to the supposed channel at the north the name "Strait Anian," and under that name it is depicted on all the maps of the next two centuries, with outlines as distinct as if they had been actually surveyed. Frobisher had shortly before discovered the strait which hearH his name, and thus in England the hope of finding a northern passage had become very strong. Without doubt t11e ex1>ectatiou of Drake was to reach Frobisher's strait from the west, and so iwuitl a long and dangerous voyage in oomiug home by the Strait of l\lagellan. Apparently with this int~ution he held on west and northwest, turning gradually eastward. The season and other circnrm;tances of his passage seem to have been favorable until be reached the forty-second parallel of north latitude. There he encountered strong northwesforly winds and extremely cold weather, but turue<i his ship to the northward and eastward, and holding that course discovered the coast of North America iu latitude 4.8 degrees north. At this point 1.'he Golden Hind anchored for some time in au 01wu, illy-sheltered ba~., It is a disputed point whether or not Drake reached the fort~·-eighth parallel as stated in The World Encompassed, or only 43 degrees, aa given in Hakluyt's report of The Famous Voyage. The best English and other foreign authorities admit 48 degrees north latitude as Drake's northern limit. The weather continued unfavoraule; tl1ick fogs prevailed, followed by a. northeast storm in which the crew suffered much hardship and were greatly discouraged. ·Finally the extreme cold and recurring storms from the northwest obliged the commander to desist from his ~arch for the supposed passage eastward, and t!Je unbrokeu character of tbe coast which he had traversed

probably hastened his determination. Be concluded that the coast, instead of turning eastward, "ran directly into Asia," and hence he resolved to sail for England by way of the Cape of Good Hope. With that intention he went southward to find a harbor on the coast of Califoruia in which his men might recruit their strength and repair the damaged veRsel for such a voyage. Iu latitlHle al>out 38 degrees north he found the desired ha·rn11, aml piously attrilmtrd its discoyer,Y to Uiviue Providence, 'vhiclt he declares had also favorerl him with a good wind for entering in safet.v. Here Drake p.:tssed nearly five weeks in re1)airing The Holden Uiud, recreating hi~ men, and exploring the surrounding country. The barllor which afforcled the needful sltelter was Yery 1nobably that small bay that since Vancouver's time lias been ~ailed Sir Francis Drake's Bay. The aJjacent country was found'' very pleasant, full of goodly plants, trees, and deer, of which (he says) soml'times thousands range in one herd.:' It is remarkable that even the golden treasures of that region did uot escape observatiou. In his report Drake says : "There is no part of eartlt here to be takell up wherein tlwre is uot som<· special likelihood of gold. or silver;" but that sentence, though oftt>n reprinted and read UJ' thousands, seems to have been overlooked or disregarded. Drake's intercourse with the natives was peaceful and cordfal to such a degree that "they made him their ki11g, and crowned him as 1mch.n He is generally regarued as the first European visitor on the territor:-· of California alHl Oregon, though he was preceded in discovery at least as far as tlw forty-third parallel by Cabrillo and Ferrelo. He named the country ":New Alhiou," because the clifft.; on the coaist appeared to him like those of Southern England. That name was retained ou all European maim except those compile<l in S1)ain for nearly two centuries. On the 23d of July Drake left the harlior, and the day following fell in with several small islands, on which bis men passed some hours in catching seals iuid birds. This group he named "The Islands of Saint James," subsequently the Spaniards called them "Los Faralloues.'' Drake tbe11 sailed westward in pursuance of ltis design of returning to Europe b~· way of the Uape of Good Hope, and on the 26th of September, 1580, arrived in England, where he was hailed as the 1irst circumnavigator of the globe. No immediate successor followed in this career. Uapt. Thomas Cavendish in 1587 made a rn;yage to the Pacific, lmt reached only the southern part of California, and recorded nothing new in the way of discovery. ·with this rxceptiou au intt>rval of two hundred years passed (157!1-1778), duriug which no E11glisl1 navigator nppeared 011 tlJe northwest~rn coast of America. The next in enterprise and discovery was Capt .·Jami's Cook, and until ltis time tht> ua111e of Drake, his harbor, his New Albion, and discoverie13 on the no1thwestn11 eoa><t of Amel'iea wen· freel~r mentioned by writers on geography.
FRANCISCO GALI AND JAYME JD.AN, 1584.

Activity was awakened by tlte inroad of tlrn English into the Pacific, and Orn Strait of Magellan became a prime object of at.teution to the S1ianiar<ls. The governors of Chili aud Peru, wishing to shut that pass against the English, o~ganized expeditions for the purpmie, and tried to construct forts there. Similar mea1mres at the _uortllwest did not seem urgent, as 110 i11trndcrt<, to their know~edge, bad found entrance or exit in that direction. This fancied security lasted nutil it became known to the Spaniards in Mexico that Drake Lad '\'isifrd and ginn the name of" New Albion" to a region far in the north. Tl1ey beard, moreon'r, tliat the English were seekiug from tl1ence the "Strait of .Ani:rn," the discovery of wltich had ueen several times prnclairned. Ft'ar:-; of what might result finally induced the Spaniards to renew their northwesteru exploratio118. ,As before mentioned, these had ceased with the vo~·ages of Uabrillo and Ferrelo. In the year 1584 Don Pedro Moya de Contreras, then Arch bishop and Viceroy of 2\lexico, fitt.c<i out a fleet under command of Capt.·Jayme ~uan, with orders to survey the northwestern coast of America. A special object in this intended expedition was to eftect sorue settlc111cnt on the coast of California.~and to erect fortificatious ''for the benefit of Spanish ships returning from

Asia."
After the year 1564 the Acapulco and Manilla galleons regularly sailed to the Philippiue Islands by a southern route, taking advantage of the trade winds. Their return yoyages wen~

made in a higher latitude, with "\'"ariahle winds, towards the sl10res of California, where northwest gales and predominant currents aidetl in the passage to Mexico. These Manilla galleons were the only Spanish ships that touched along the northwestern coast, and, so to speak, the.r had in that casual way kept some kuowle<lge respecting it. For their safet.r in returning it was essential that the coast should he better known, and that some settlement, and, if possible, harbors for shelter slwultl he established. As before stated, such an undertaking had been determined upon in 1584. \\'bile tl1e Yiceroy, Contreras, was preparing in the harbor of Acapulco the expedition for .tlJat 1mr1mse, a n·r;sel from 4'\si<t arrin~tl tllere nrnlt'r command of the able autl enterprising pilot I·ranciRco Gali. He was llelieYed to haYe seen more of tlte northern parts of the Pacific Ocean, including tlle eoast of Northeastern Asia as well as that of Northwestern America, than any one of his precleeesRor1-:. Hence his Yoyage enlisted much attention, aud though mainly intended for trade it ranked arnong;;t enterprises for discovery. Inforurntron in regard to Gal i's voyage is contained in the work of Juan Hugues de Linschoten, "Hei8e·geschrift von tle navigation der PortugaloiRers in orienten," which was translated into Eugli:;;;h in 1598, and pnblislwd by T. Wolfe in London. Linscboteu says that the report which he gins of Gali's vo.rnge wa" translated from the original Spanish ·into Low Dutch. Hakluyt repriute<l iu hi,; tliird Yolnme, in moo, the English translatiou of 'Wolfe. Gali bad sailed in the year 1582 from Acapulco to Manilla, and from thence to :Macao. Leaving the latter port on the 24th of Jnly, 1584, Ile returned by way of .Japan, of which Empire he believed he had seen the nortbem;tern extremity, aud then stretched -his comse over the Pacific Ocean, in a direction "Past and northeast'' towards America. The point where he reached the coast has been a matter of doubt. Navarrete and some others state the latitude as 57i degrees north; but the :English liiRtoriami of the South Sea, Burney, Travers, Twiss, and others, assign the fower parallel of 37i degrees. Tbis last a111)ears most probable, as it is supported by tlte Dutch report of J,inschoten, by the translation of Hakluyt, aml by the subsequent editions of his report. The version 57i degrees north occurs first in a French trauslatfon of I..inschoten, entitJed "Le Grand Houtier de mer. Amsterdam, 1638," and is probably a misprint. Gali states that he saw on the coast a beautiful country covered with forests and entirely without snow. Sailing, aR lie did, from Macao, at the end of July, he probably reached the coast of America late in October, aud at that time of the ~-ear he would no doubt ha1e found Mount Edgecnrnbc, nearest. to which Nm·arretc supposes him to have touched, covered with snow. ThiK voyage was a trading expedition. With Gali, discovery was incidental. His report does not refer to a northwest passage. The object was, with sbip and goods, to reach New Spain wit.hout delay. Nothing but irresistible 1wcessity, due to storms, could have driven him so far out of his course. He seems t-0 have followed the usual track of Manilla vessels, perhaps a little farther to the 11orthward. 'l'hc expedition then preparing at Acapulco, being destined for the region so recently visited l1y .Gali, the Yiceroy consulted that navigator in regard to it, and tbe report of his vo.\·age seems to lmw het'll drawn in response. This was acc0rnpanied hy a map giYing latitudes and longitudes. How far the preparations of Contreras liad then advanced is not exactly known; probably not far, a:-i in a lettt·r to the King of Spain, dated Match 24, 1585, he alludes to his" intentions," and :-<01i1'.its tilt· ro;yal xanction and support. However, the viceroy waR superseded in his government at the end of the ,\·ear.
8EBASTIAN RODRIGUEZ CERMENON, 1595.

It bas ht'<m alreacl,y mentioned that the English adventurer Cave11dish, had, like Drake, made l1is way to the coast of California. In emulation of the last-named commander, Cavendish cap· tured the Santa Anna, one of the richest of the :Manilla galleons. 'l'his was in November, 1587. The !mis, when made known in S1iain, 1mggested the expediency of sending out tbeir vessels, intended for California, from thl' Pl1ilippine Islands, ratber than from Mexicq. because the prevail· ing winds would in that case he favorable. Don I,nis Velasco, Viceroy of New Spain from 1590to1595, aooordingly issued instructions for testing the route. It is probable tbat Gomez Perez de la Marinas, to whom that service was

iutrmited, used one of the regular Manilla galleons, as the vessel (The. S. Augustin), beside:,; beiug commissioned to make discoveries, was laden with silk,; aud other oriental goods de:stinerl for Mexico. Navarrete says that this ship was specially commis;_;ioned to examine the ''port of San FranciFco." aud its vicinity. So far as we know, this iis the fir:st mention of a port with tllat name. 'l'lte adventure was extremely unfortunate. Cermefton reaehed the eoast of California, but his vessel was wrecked in the immediate vicinity of a larg·e harbor, called by Torquemada, the historian of the expedition, Puerto de San l''nmciiscu. The shiJJ, the goods, and the greater part of tlw crew were lost. Some of the men fouud their way liack to J'rfpxieo, and an:ougst them Fraucisco de Volai'ios (called" Pilote Mayor"), who gave information of the disaster, aud afterwards (iu 1003) accompauied Viscaino to the place wl1ere it occurred. I,'rom some accounts it seems that the vessel was stranded im;ide of tbe bay; but tlle Spanish pilot, Cabrera llueno, in hiR sailing directions (Dalrymple, p. 48), seems to indicate the Farallones, but adds, tlrnt "the loss was due more to the fault of those on board th:rn to' stress of weatlleT." \Vbat is known of this interesting f>x1w.dition is stated by Torquemada. Argensola does not mentio11 it. in his history of the PhilipJ>ine Islands. The San Augustin is said to have foundered "in the port of Ran Fraucisco." The Spanish pilot says: "l 1l the port of San Francisco, on the islands of Farallones "! Some have thought that the ''Puerto de San Fraucisco" of Torquemada was our Bay of San Francisco, but it is more probable that he applied the name, as the pilot, Bueno, evidently did, to the waters sonth of Point Heyes, east of the l<'arallones, and off the Golden Gate. Subsequent statementR seem to proYe that neither tbey nor Vulaftos bad any k11owledge of the landlocked bar now bearing that name.
sEUAsTIAN VIZCAINO, 159ti.

The wreck of the Sau Augustin made eYideut tbe necessity for a st-ttlerneut 011 the coast of CaMfornia, and preparations to that end were ordered by Philip II, to carry out. the plans of the Yiceroy, Contreras. Soldiers, sailors, and laborers were recruit1ed, and three vessels were fitted out with requisites for a settlement. Some womrn were also embarked. The expedition waR placed in charge of the very enterprising pilot, Vizcaino. The principal authorities for particulars reGpecting this expedition are Torquemada '' J\Ionarquia Indiana," and KaYarrete, who used some manuscripts (" algunos documeutos manuscriptos ") which he does not further describe.. This upeditiou sailed from Acapulco in the begiuning of the year 159G and was in all respects ineffectual. Vizcaino Rpent his time, provisionR, and means in an abortive attempt to found a Hettlement on the rocky coast of the Californian peninsula; bnt finding his ships and their crews no longer in a couditiou to pursue diseoveries, he returned at the eud of the year. The onl_y result was merely the change of a name. TLc bay known in the time of Cortes as Santa Cruz waR subsequently called La Paz. Some delay in Californian research followed the death of Philip II; hnt in Hi!J!l lJis success~n': Philip III, s·ent orders to the count of Monterey, Viceroy of Mexico, to make arrangements for :in expedition to the northwest. Monterey decided to employ Vizcaiuo, wllo was tlieu suppol'.lt'd to l1ave more knowledge of the coasts of New Spain than any other commander. Un bis ;;ecuud voyage he set out from Acapulco on the 5th of Ma~', 1602. The principal sources of i11forrnation respecting it are the followiug : 1. The original journal kept by the Carmclite mouk, Fath<'r Antonio de la Aiscension, wl10 accompanied the expe-0.ition. Venegas says in his N oticia, volume III, page 23, that hl· sought in vain in the archives of Seville for the original journal of Vizcaiuo's Yoyage. Navarrete says (lmge !xviii) that he found there a copy of the original, which original bad bee11 left for prese!'Yation iu MeAico. 2. A report of the voyage by Torquemada in his "Monarquia Indiana," lib. 5, cap. 45. This writer had access to the· journal of Father Antonio, or lrnd a cop)·, from which he made extracts. But as the report itself was never printed, Torquemada was for upwards of two centuries tl1e only authority in regard to the particulars of the voyage. When his work (printed in Hi15, and again in 1725) became rare, Venegas reprinted it (in 1757) in his" Noticiade la California." 3. Navarrete, who, in addition to the original report of Father Antonio, used other manuiscript documents, acceasible only to himself. He names the following :

Thirty-two charts aucl plans of the coast, showing ports, inlets, &c., made by Enrico Martinez, cosmogra plier of the Kiug, iu New Spain. Navarrete compiled .from them a general chart. He used oll1er documents, but does uot specif.)' in regard to them. v\'ith greHtH l'n<'ilities tllan either of llis predecessors, Vizcaino :;u1Teyed more accurately the coast line of California from Cape Sau Lucas nort11westward to beyond Oape Mendocino, beyond which liunt he was not authorized to go. Tliat headland was the point for which the Manilla vessels ou their home voyages usuall:y made; aud nortll of it tbey uever sailed. Vizcaino had with l1im tlxperienced officers, amougst whom were Volanos, tl1e surviviug pilot· of the Sau Augustin, and a distinguished cosmograpber, Ueronimo Martin, who was commissioned to draw the ma1>s aud cliarts of the expedition. The tlt'et commanded by Yizcaiuo cousisted of two large ships, the Capitana San Di~go and tl1e Fregata Treti lleyes, wl1icll last was accompanied hy a small tender, the Santa 'l'omas, for navigation in shoal water. Be had ah;o a long hark (nn harco luengo) for entering inlets, riven;, and creeks, but that craft 1noving to be an iucnrnbra11ce was abandoned near Cape San Lucas. Duriu,g· the first six mouths the imrty was employed in carefully examining the western coast of Lower Califor11ia. They diiscoverPd, named, and 1'!11I'Yl\VCd a number of bays, as Magdalena, Sau ta Mariua, Ballena1-;, San Jfartholome, Simou and Judas, and 'l'odos Jos Santos. Offtlrn southeru extremity of the coast, where they arrived ea1ly in Nonmber, four small islands were discovered, to which tl1eJ gan· the uame "de los Uoronados." On the 10th of the same month the little fleet entered a harbor north of the Coronados, which harbor, sixty years earlier, CalJrillo bad uamed San Miguel; Vizcaino gave it the name of San Diego de Alcada, probably in houor of the holiday which falls on the 12th of November, and perhaps, also, to comuwmoratc tbc name of bis flagship. With the two exceptions (Point Pinos and Cape Mendocino), no geographical name giYen b~' Uabrillo has been retained. Hence it may be inferred that Vizcaino· was not acquainted witli Cabrillo's reports nor guided by his maps. After prnviding wood and water Vizcaino sailed on the 20th of November. On tbe 27th they bad iu sight a large island, which they uamcd Santa Uatalina, as first seen on St. 9atharine's day. It was found to he deuisely populated. After mapping the island the voyagers kept on southward aml reached tht· island now know11 as San Clemente, the survey of which was deferred and not finally accomplished. Hence it rem,ived no name at the time, and is not marked on the chart of Vizcaino. Ou the evening of Santa Barbam's day (~hi of December) the party was at the eastern end of a chaiu of isla11ds between wbieh and the coast of California lay a broad channel. Through this tljpy sailed, favored by a southwest wiud, which opportunely continued until thf'y reached the extremits of tlle passage near l'oint Couception. There the weather changed. A furious northwest gale, wit11 a heavy sea, separated the ships and threw them back towards the islands 'l'he storm of two days 811bsided as the calendar marked "the feast of Holy Nicolas" (December 6) and the mune of the isaint, 11erhaps, in allusion to this eYent, was given to one of the Santa Barbara Islands. Soon afterwards the tleet rounded the c~ape which Cabrillo bad doubled under like stress of weather sixt~· ,\·ears earlier, and which be at the time gave the name of t)abo de Galera. Vizcaino named it "Punta de la limpia Conception," and it is still known as Point Conception. Sailing along the coast towards :Monterey the mariners came in sight of a range of high mountains whicll Cabrillo had seen at the same season of the year (early in winter) and nametl "Sierra de S. Martin.'' It was named by Vizcai110, "Sierra cle Santa Lucia," probably because it came into view on the 13th of December, the da,y of the Holy Lucia. By that name the mountain range is yet known amo11gst Spaniards. The captaius of returning Manilla veasels had been accustomed to recognize the coast of California by this landmark. A small riYer, 2 leagues soutb of Point Pinos, also received the name which it still bears (Rio

On the l:!th of .January a higl1 projectiug cape was reached in latitude 4l~o nortli, thougl1t by tlw pilot~ t,o he Caho Mendocino, where the,v encountered a strong Houtlrnast storm, th:ck fogs, awl a bohiterous sea. Six only of the crew were capable of dut;r; the otl1ers and the officers and missionaries were sick (en las camas) in their beds. Under these circumstances it. wa;o; decided to tm·n back, but. the storm lasted for s<nne day!;\ and drore them Rtil1 further north. At length, on tlie 21st. of January, a northwest wind set in imd cleared tlie atmosphere. They observed for latitude at 4!20 north (in their reckoning), where a wl1ite cape was in view, which they nli,med "el Cabo Blanco de Sim Sebastian," because fair weather appeared on the eve of the da;r of the mart.ns, Sau Fabian and San Sebastian. From thence they turned hack to the southeast wifh a fayomhle wind. The eape is Hot indicated on Vizcaino's chart, nor is it marked to show either latitude or longitude. I,ater Spanish navigators have giYeil the name Cabo San Sebastian to a point near the 42d parallel, now called Point G-eorge; but as before state~, if Torquemada puts Cape Me)'.Jdoci110 one degree too far north, it is probable that other assigned positions are as much in error. Its true place therefore would be near Humboldt Bay or Trinidad. Bay. The home voyage was quickly made, and to allow -0bserYation the ship was stilered as near to tile coast as 11ossible. But very little could be done, as the crew was sick with scurvy and some among them died. The intended surve;y of the other Santa l~arhara Islands was of necessity renounced, as also the resolution to winter at Bahia de la Paz to wait for supplies. The;y sailed, therefore, directly for New Spain, and arrived in the ha1·bor of Aca1mko on the 21st of :March, 1603, where they again met the crew of the Fregata. The gale of the 6th of Januai·.Y, which bad separated the two vessels,.and from which the San Diego had sought shelter iu the Puerto de San Francisco, bad carried the Tres Re_yes (commanded by Martin de Aguilar) some distance further north. Oft' Mendocino he encom1tered the same southeast storm which had forced Vizcaino iut,o port, and was clriven by it to latitttde 430 north, according to an observation made on the 19th of January by the chief pilot, Antonio Flores. Here Aguilar gave the name of Oabo Blanco to a white cape, where (as Torquemada says) "the coast begins to turn to the northwest." Near it ran a deep and crooked river, which he attempted to enter, but its strong outward current baffled every effort. After doubling Cape Mendocino, the Fregata, having advanced further north than was warranted by instructions, turned hack eQuthward; and the crew suffored greatly from scurvy. Aguilar and Flores died before the vessel which carried them reached San Diego. The ship H.Ex.43-71

was, tlit1refore, taken to Acapulco by the pilot, Estavan Lopez, aud there he wa.s joined by the Capitaua. The general opinion bas been that the extreme limit reached by Aguilar was the present Cape Blaueo or Orford, which is usually marked on Spanish maps "Cabo Blanco de Aguilar," but that supposition rm;ts on the siugle observation for latitude made by the pilot, Flores. If the latitude stated iu Torquema<la for Cape Mendocino is one deg1·ee too high, we should look for this Cape Blanco somewhere about Point George; but there is near it no consideral>le stream, nor beyond it does the coast begin to turn to the northwest, but, on the contrary, trends somewhat eastward. MoreO\·er, it is said llY Vancouver that our Cape Blanco or Orford does not look white, being covered with demm forests down to the sea. To reconcile the discrepancies, or at least some of tliem, Captain Burney supposed that in January, when Aguilar was on the coast, every part exposed to the prevailing wind was probably whitened with snow. Near Point George the Klamatl1 River empties, and beyond that entrance the coast incliues to the northwest. It is possible, therefore, that the position bere referred to may have been the Cape Blanco of Aguilar, hut the question cannot be decided. The river was not deP,med of much consequence. Crooked and deep it is styled in the report, and doubtless it was magnified iuto undue importance, it may he, he.eause that point was for a century and a half the northeru limit of Spanish navigation. Every inlet or river mouth in that region was expected to be or to lead int;o the Strait of .Anian, or into the western end of some passage around America. Aguilar's cape and river are noticed in all geogra11l1ical book;;, and are marked on _nearly all maps of tl1e 8twenteenth and eighteenth 11ent11ries. Thfa expedition of Yizcaiuo, like that of Oabrillo, was morn 1mccesMful than otht-r Spanhd1 ,,oyages to the northwest. Buth saw the same stretch of coast, and reached about the same latitude. Vizcaino observed ever~·thing closely, and his work deserves t-0 be called a detailed reconnaissance. His desire was to push exploration northward; fiud the Strait of Anian; sail arouud America, and return by that route to Spain. But these schemes were never accomplished. Vizcaino went to Spain, and after much exertion obtaiued from l'hilip III an order for the furtherauce of his prQjects, but before n.,,eclful arrangements could he completed he died, aud with l1im t'xpired the spirit of enterprise. It was, says Navarrete; ''an epoch in which the Spanish nation retrograded." Spain was not afterwards governed by such mouarchs as Ferdinan9, Charles, and 1'11iliv II.
NEW MEXICO.

During the seventeenth century the court of Spain waR beset. by applicants, native and for_eign, offoriug vague prqjects for the development of the Straits of Anian; and many unsuccessful t·xpeditionli were planned for settlements on the peninsula of' Oalitoruia. Throughout the century i1othi11g" was done to advance knowledge respecting the geography of tbu northwest. That region iwemed to he forgotten. There was, however, one expedition planned near the close of the previous c<'ntnrJ, aJl(l accomrilished, which w a certain degree connected with tLe geographical history of the western coast. This was the discovery, conquest, and settlement of New Mexico. The 1·11teprh;e, like ma11y others, was suggested by a Franciscan monk, :Priar Augustin Ruiz, who lived iu tlie valley of 8a11 Bartolomeo, near the silver mines of Santa Barbara, at the outskirta of the Spauish settlements. As early a.'! 1581 he had journeyed among .tlle Indians at the north, and brought hack intelligeuce of a beautiful and populous valley through wl1iclt flowed a river several lrnndn·d leagues in length. Antonio de Bspejo, a wealth~' and energetic-man, put himself at the bead of a company of soldiers, and with some Franciscan monks marched, in 1582, to search for the valley and river described by Uniz. As he afterwards reported, Espejo reached "nearly to the sonrce of the river" and found every when~ villages and towns, with the inhabitants of which he held friendly interconrse. Be also made a journey to the eastward through the buffalo country, and another westward as far ns Cibola and the river Gila, where Coronado had been previously. Jn 1583, E.sriejo re.turned to Mexieo and reported his discoveries. Attempts were made at foterval.s for the conquest of the interior, and at length Monterey, the Vreeroy who hafl directed the YOJages of Vizcaino, struck a decisive blow. He dispatched Juan de Of.iate, an oDleer of high

repute, with an army of about one hundred Spaniards and five hundred lndiam;, to thl' north, took possession of the country, and gave to it the name of New Mexico. Thus OD.ate became the founder and first governor of the new province, and in it was established, in 1611, the tluuri:shing capital of Santa Fe. In these contemporaneous expeditions of Vizcaino and Ofiate may be traced a correspondence with the sea and land enterprises of. Alarcon and Coronado, sent ont by Mendoza. Thti upper valley of the Rio del Norte is a fertile oasis in the midst of deserts. Santa Fe soon became a station of greHt importance as the depot for all Spanish expeditions to the eastrn, northern, and western regions. l·'rom thence discovery was pushed to Lake Utah, called by the Spaniards" Timpanagos," and westward far into the territory watered by the river Gila. After the settlement of the coast of California a road was laid out, terminating at Santa Fe. The first explorers of the valle;v of the Rio del Norte reached that river near the g-reat bend called El Paso, where the channel takes au. easterly course towards the Gulf of Mexico. 'I'htSpaniards bad explored only tbe upper \'alleJ. ·They knew indeed of the Rio Rranl, but belienid it to be a separate rh~er, lutving followed it only to El Paso where the stream is hidden :unougst rocks and mountaim·. Ignorant of the course, the termination was supposed to be in one of the rivers of Cinaloa, or Rome water-course emptying into the Gulf of California. The discon~ry, therefore, of the Rio <lei Norte was considered by many as pertaining to the hh~t.ory of the northwestern side of .America, aud as merely an addition to their knowledge of the Pacific ha.!lin. This l1ypotbesis, or rather geographical error, was long maintained, but was corrected on Europea11 maps by Coron4:1lli about the year 1680. Of the'fabulous accounts in regard t() discover_y, circulated between H:i09 and Hi2il, only two are descrYing of mention, namely, those of Ferrer Maldonado and the so-called Juan 11e Fuea. The false reports were repeatedly disproved, but they influenced the hi01tory of gnograpby. Maps were constructed and the erroneous details were admitted in historical works. Names attached to the assumed discoveries were given to previously known localities as well as to imaginary straits, rivers, and countries.· Expeclitions were organized aud instructions were issued for exploring the regions that bad been fictitiously described. In 1700, the officers of the Spanish expedition of the Descubierta and .Atrevida were directed to explore the coasts, straits, and harbors supposed to have been discovered by Maldonado.· The influence of tl1~e stories 1lates from the time of their promulgation, and not from the period at which the incidents were supposed fo have ~urred. Maldouado J>retended that be sailed in the >'ear 1588, but the" results" of hiR voyage were not girnn to the world until the year 1609. De Fuca, thongh bis expedition was said to have been made in 1592, brought DQ account of it before the public previous to the year 1625. In a chronologica.l record of disooveri~s these impositions must be referred to the time of their pu blica.tion. Lorenzo Ferrer Maldonado was well known in Spain as a schemer and adventurer, and bis story touches but lightly the geography and history of Ca.lif0rnia. He pretended to have sailed from Lisbon to Labrador in 1588; and from Labrador to the Pacific through a narrow strait hy which a pa81!13ge from Spain to China could be accomplished in three months. In 1609 he presente1l to the Spanish Government a n>port on discoveries and added a. proposal to return to the spot and employ himself in erecting fortifications against the encroachment of foreigners. But, after careful examination, bis statements were decided to be false, and his proposition was of course re:j(-icted. He was treated as an ignorant impost.or and charlatan. Some subsequent historians, nevertheless, rliady to believe any wonderful tale, mention these pretended travels and discoveries; ancl thus the su~eet was kept alive through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Copies of Maldonado's original papers deposited in the Spanish archives found their way, we know not bow, int-0 foreign countries, and near the end of the eighteenth century ( 1790) the French geographer, Bu ache, "who c1nng fondly to qnestionable discoveries," drow attention to them by declaring his confidence in the veracity of Maldonado's statements. The last, perhaps, to give credence to the narrative of adventures was the Italian s1want Amoretti who in 1812 edited an old manuscript found in the Ambroaian Libr.a.ry, which 01anu8cript be supposed to be a copy of the original report.

The author of the article in the Quarterly tliinks it possible that Maldonado might haw seen Cook's Riwl', and mistaken it for a strait between America aml Asfa. See all'o Burnt>y's History of Voyages to tbe South Sea, Yol. Y; and Barrow's Chronological History of Voyages to the Arctic Bay. The story of Juan de Fu ca bear::i n iorn directly on oue su ~jei·t. It was first printed by Purcbas in his third volume, aud was pnblisl1ed iu 1G25, although it seems to have been in manuscript some time earlier, and ma;y b,n-e h('t'll known to a few persons. The En_glisbman Lok relates, in tlle report pul>lit<llt-<1 b~· J'nrchas, tliat he md iu Venice au old Greek navigator named Juan de Fuca or Apostolos ValeriallOl', wlw told him that he had l>ern a captain in the Spanish service, and as such had been sent in 1.J92 to the nortl1 w tJl't in com ruaIJd of a small vessel b:v the Yiceroy of l\Iexico, probably Don Luis de Yelasco, who filled that post fr0111 1590to1595. He stated that be bad sailed along the coast of California he.mild the forty-seventh parallel of north latitude; an<l there found the coast trending east and Hortlleast, forming with tbe opposite sbore a broad inlet. At the entrance be said there wa,,; a remarkable rock, having tlte appearance of an island, and northwest of it a pJ·ramidal rock. Beyond tbis strait spread a wide inland sea, which stretched into openings t-0warrls the south, the north, a11d tbe east. At Yarious place8 on the shores he had found fertile country aml natives clothed in the skins of auimals. He further asserted that he sailed a long course through open water, and after J1assing rnauy islan~ls came ont into the North Sea or Atlantic Ocean, from whence he returued to Mexi' o aHd n·ported to tbe vicero~·. He had also reported in person to the King of Spaill, but thongli well receiwd i11 l1otb instanees hi1' senice.s were iwt properly rewarded, and he finally returned to the island of Cephalonia, where he belonged. This account soon after appeared in a work published b;y Lucas Fox, and was repeated by many writers. Believers in the truth of the narrative were numerous in tlte seventeenth aud eighteenth centuries. De Fuca's discoverie8, like those of l\Ialdonado, were represented on maps, and De Fuca's Strait is laid down uorth of California in contemporary works, at about 47 or 48 degrees of north latitude. Towards the end of the eighteenth ceutmy such a strait as De Fuca has described was fouud beyond the forty-E\ighth parallel, trending· eastward, opening- into wide water, having many islarnls a11d inlets to t11e south, north, a1:d east; 1mrrom1ded, too, b;y a fr.rtile country, and peopled hy fur-clad inhabitants. Some traY('lers thought they recoguizecl the pillar-like rock 011 the southen1 side of tlie entrance, as he had represented. l\Ian~· were induced to belieYe in the truthfulness of De Fuca's report, and the channel was named De Fuea's Strait. Some thought that the first part of bis story, !'O far as it related to the channel and a broad gulf beyond, might be true, hut uoubts were entertained iu regard to his coming out upon the Atlantic. It seems likely that he passed around Yancotwer's Island, after heiup; in the Gulf of Georgia, and so passed into the Pacific. But NaYarrete ai,;serts that no navig;1tor of the name Juan de Fuca or Apostolos Valerianos was ever at auy time known in SpH iu or mentioned by eon temporary Spanish writers; uor i8 there extant any record of the visit of 1-mch a person to the King of Spain or to the viccroJ' of Mexico. In none of the papers relating to the expeditions of Vizcaino, written only a few years after 1592 (the time of De .l<'11<.,-a's.su11posed vo~age), can be foun<l any allu8ion to him; nor is any docmnent bearing on bis history in the archives of St·villa or New S1iain. It seems probable that .Tuan de }'uca never made a voyage in the senice of the viceroy of Spain, nor discovered a strait in the latitude indicated, and it may be cousidered as a mere aceident that in the begiuning of tbe se,·enteentll century a strait in that region was described iu a mannel' coinciding so nearJy with the reality as ascertained at a. mnoh later llate. The history of Spauish expeditions to the peninsula of California. is somewhat tedious. They were uot ablj' conducte<l; they entailed large expense; scarcely furthered the Jlrogress of discovery; aud in no instance enlarged the boundaries of the Spanish settlements In fact, they touched only the 8011ther11 part of the eastern coast of the penimmla. The wesMru coast of the peninsula was not surveyetl, nor was the upper end of the Sea of Cortes visited for m~ny. years. Its configuration, 'Well

known in the time of Cortes and Mendoza, was so utterly forgotten that the gulf was supposecl to extend to the forty-eighth parallel, and that it connected there hy a channel, both with the Pacitic Ocean and with the Atlantic. California was considered, therefore, not as part of the continent, but as a large islaud reaching from De Fuca Strait to Cape San Lucas. This erroneous notion seems to barn originated with some Dutch freeboowrs called Picltilingucs, who in the begin11ing of the se\'eritecntli century formed a piratical settlerneut in t!Je Ba:y of I'icl1iliugne, on t!Je soutl1eru coast of California. They 'caused it to he reported in Holland that a n~ssel hatl ouce ,;aile<l tbrong-11 the Sea of Cortes (Gulf of California) to the north, and from tlieuce had eome out upon the Pacific, thus circumnaYigating tlie whole area of California, Tue story was believed, and a map constructed to accord with it was sent to England. Purcha;;;, who was one of the earlie...:;t adluwent,.; of this geographical·theory, pnblisl1erl nu account of it in 1625 in the third n>lume of his Pilgrims, autl inserted also the first printed map of :Korth America, on which California i8 represented as an .island, and the Sea of Cortes as a broad cham1el of enormous length. The Yiews of Purclms were adopted by nearly all the g·eographers of the time. Spaniards, C">en forgetting the maps of Castillo aml their otlwr pilots (then lying in the Spanish an:hin-s), shared at last fully i11 the hL·lief, allll :ibout the year 1670 changell the name Califomia to another in ho11or of their sovcrnig-n, Clwrle8 II. TheJ· named the countrJ· "las Islas Carolinas, 11 iutimating that it forme<l a cluster of large islarnls. The unsuccessful attempts made at this time b~· Spauiards, in regard to discon·r~· and dm-elopment, appear as types of the coudition into wl1ic!J the great Spauish mouarcl1,Y li:ul falll'll. In tliis prostration Mexico participated.

Father Andres Peri:z de Ribas, a Jesuit, wrote the history of this ex1wdition. · One of the vessels of Iturbi had been captured by tlie Pic!Jilengnes, and it was feared that those pirates might attack also the retuming Manilla galleon. Iturbi, therefore, on arrirnl, was isent out again to protect t!Je gallt>on, and the further t>xploratio11 of Cali1ornia wa:s abandmwd. T.!Jere was no other effort in regard to that ohiect made until 1632, when Franciseo de Crtega attempted it. He S'l1neyed only a small part of the coast between Cape San fa1cas and the Baliia de la Paz, and from the last-mentioned place made bis way back to Mexico. 111 1633 and Hi34, he made two other voyages to the same regiou, with the intention of founding a. settlement, hut the attempt was unsuccessful. Iturbi seems to have deriYed some profit from tlie pearl fisheries, w!Jich were theu still productiYe. Spanish settlers on the coast of Mexico and Uiualoa were tliereby induced. to lit out vessels and cross the Gulf of California to seek for·pearls on the opposite shore. In official expeditions, or such as were assisted and faYored by Government, Ortl'ga was followed by bis pilot, Estavan Oarboneli, who affirmed that hii;; cllief had failetl from want of knowledge and courage. Carboneli 11roruised to find, in a higher latitude, a more fertile eonntr,\·, better adapted for settlement, and be set sail for that object in the ~·ear lfi36. He '· a<lvauced as far north as he could," to what latitude is not, stated, but only sterile rocks and poor lmii<rns were to be seen. He collected tsome pearls~ as others had who preceded him, and returned to New Spain, where Ortega saw.him derided, in turn, as an ignorant poltroon. Venegas says that one reason wlly these repeated expeditions to California did uot succeed was that no care was taken of former reports, ~urveys, maps or plans. '' They were not carefully preserved and made known by print." The usefulness of the enterprise beiug eYident, it was renewed in the ;year 1642 b3· the Yiceroy Don Diego Lopez Pacheco, who sent on this occasion the governor of Cinaloa, Don fa1is Cestin de Canas, with soldiers and missionaries, with the often repeated instructions '' to survey the

ooasta, bays, islands, rivers, inlet&, and crooks of California." The result was much the same as

in former iustances. Cestin YiRited Bahia de la Paz, and from thence sailed along the coast, \Jut only "forty 11,agnes to the northwest." Father Jacinto Cortes. a Jesnit missionary who accompanied him, wrote a n·port of the expedition, which report was sent to the Viceroy, with some pl\arls which had hee11 collected on the coast. Gonm1or Cestiu was followed in adventure lly the Admiral Don Pedro Porter de Ca.sanate Veueg-a,; so writes the name, hut in Navarrete it is written "Porter .r Casanata." · Casanate embarked for California in 1643. Three years earlier tfiat officer had been commissi01U'(l to smTey the coasts of the Pacific iu the imnrndiate vicinity of the peninsnla (Lower Califomia) and to make soundiugs. Navarrete 8ays that the results, after presentation to the council of the lndicR, were deposited with other documents iu the "Archives of India." Huly eu1poweretl iu 1640 to make the iut.ended l'xploration, Casauate had also, by authority, a mouopoly i11 n·gard to navigation in the Gulf. The reason of his detentiou in Spain is not , t>xplailwd. In rn-14, when his expedition was ready, he was ordered to sail without delay toward Cape Sau Lneas, U> eonn·y the Manilla galleou, and protect it against some E11glish a11d Dutch pirates wlio had heeu seen in tlie waters of .b~ew Spain. At leugt-h the 1mr>ey was commenced on the eastern coast of the peninsula, but was again deferred in com;equence of an urgent call to guard the Manilla ws;;els against the ever-threatening pirates. Thn8 interrupted, the Admiral did not return to Califoruia, but reporting the difficulty of the untlertakiug to the Viceroy of Mexico, he was soon afterwards sent to South America and made Governor of Chili. Hi8 ahortfre undertakings in regard to geographical development were so <lisconraging that an i11terval of tweuty years elapsed in which nothiug was done. But, towards the end of the reign of Philip IV, an order was issued for further exploration. The command of an expedition was intrnRtt><l to Admiral Don Bernardo Bernal de Piiiatlero. The outfit was imiall, as the condition of the Spanish treasury was low. ..With two small vessels be sailed, in 16ti4, for California. Instead, however, of surveying the coast, the avaricious soldiers of the party would attend to nothing except pearl fishing. They forcen the natives to do all the heavy work for them, itml wbeu a qnautit;v of pearls had been secured they quarreled among themselves in the division. Pii'iadero, for himself, secured a small share, but was constantly engaged in eftorts to keep his men from quarreling. · A second voyage by the same admiral in 1667 was not more successful, and no result marked the next expedition, which was led hy Francisco Lucenilla in 1668· .Philip IV, the monarch who bad directed the last· mentioned enterprist's, died in 1665. In the early part of the reign of his successor, Charles II, nothing was done. But the Council of the Indies, aware of the advantages that might result. from the conquest of Califoruia, determined to renew etforts towards that end. In the year 1677, orders for the purpose were issued to the Vieeroy of l\lexieo, and a contract was made with the Admiral Don Isidoro de Atondo a.a commander, who was confident of success notwithstanding the failure of all bis predecessors. On the 18th of 1\fo;r, 16&), Atondo sailed with two ships carrying sailors and soldiers, and a third vesiwl laden with implements, munitions, and provisions. He arrived at Bahia de la Paz twd fortitiP<l against hostile Indians, but the store-ship, beaten oft' by storms, was so long delayed t-hat the Roldien~ suffered for want of food. One of the vessels was therefore sent to New Spain aml obtaim·<i a cargo, hut was unable to reach port. Three attempts were made, bnt the vessel wHs tlriveu back :iltbou~h in sight of the coast. Under these circumstances Atondo found it im11os1"1i\Jle to maintain ortler,«md was ol1liged to a.baadon his position at La Paz. By the sale oc everything he could dispetise with he was enabled to procure provisions, a.nd he embarked for a. more northern ba,v in latitnde 4(iO 30', which be called San Bruno. This doubtless wa.s the bay afterwards called by the Jesuits "Bahia de la Conception." On biR arrival Ato11tlo commenced a settlement, built a church, and passed a year in exploring the neighboring regions. Be made distant excursions, and tried by traversing the peninsula to reach the Pacific side. On these journeys, and generally in his travels, be was accompanied by missionary Jesuit.", who thus became thoroughly acquainted with the country.and learned the 'languages of the natives. At the head of these missionaries was the intelligent Fathel' Kino, or Kuhu, a German, who had served as cot'lmographer(cosmogra.fo mayor) in thee:xpecilition,andwho subsequently wrote a very interesting IWCOUnt of it.

Atondo seems to have been energetic, but he spent nearly three years in ineffectual attempts to make a settlement in California. Finding it impossible to procure means for mai11taini11g· a colony, in the autumn of 1685 be re-embarked the soldiers and missionarietl, and taking a fpw of the baptized Indians, returned to Mexico. There he found other employment, and in addition was ordered to start, to oppose pirates and convoy home the Manilla galleons. Nothing wal:i gai11ed h:v the expeditions of Atondo. They were costly, and consequently then~ was liHle dispm;ition eitht"r in Mexico or Spain to incur further outlay. The government, of Mexico. says Father Baegert "rl'nounced not only all activity in this direction, but actually refused assistance and protection for private undertakings to California."
1697-1717.

California, thus abandoned by the Spa11ish Government, still had the atteution of tht> .l em1iti-;, who were then powerful and acth'e in both divisions of the western hemisphere. They liad eRtablisbed missio11s along 1be eastern side of the Gulf of California, and tlnougL Cinaloa, Sonora, and Pimeria, and fnrnished missionaries, journalists, cosmogra11hers, and llistorians to nearly all the, Government expeditions, down to that of Admiral Atondo, who was, as already stated, accompanied by :Father Kino. These pious men thought that by preaching to tl1e Indians, and conrersiug with and civilizing them, might .be accomplished, what no avaricious merchant or pearl fislit>r, no sailor or soldier, however courageous, had been able to effoct, the settlement and exploration of California. They proposed therefore a system of procedure in which miRsionaries should not he 1:mbordi11ate either to a military or naval chii~ftain. Missionaries were to take the lead with :111 army at their command. '.l'l1e most complete history of the .JesuitA'I in California is "Noticia de la California y de sucon. qnista temporal y espiritual basta el tiempo presente, sacada de la bistoria manuscript.a formado in Mexico afio de 1739, por el padre Miguel Venegas, de la Compafiia de Jes us; ~· de otras N otieias y Relaciones antiqnas y modernas Aiiaclida de algunos mapas particulares, Madrid, 1757.'' The work is in three Yolumes, and is generally ascribed to Venegas ; but the history of Oalifomia is carried, by him only down to the year 1739. Andrea!'\ Marco Burriel corn piled from the rnamuc:m·ipts of Venegas and from other sources and issued an edition in 1752. The work is Yaluable, lrnt' there are misprints in regard t-0 the chronology. The third volume contains intcrt·.stiug quotatiorn1 from other authm·s and treatises 011 geographical qu~stions relating to California. On the subsequent history of the Jesuits in California, from t 752 to 1767, wlten tliey were compelled to leave that country, many books have been published. One of the most valna1>1P of these was written by Baegert, and was printed in 1773. Baegert was a Germau Jesuit wlio patlsfo,(} much time iu California. His clear narrative and description of the country include reJtc\re11ces to the missions. and journeys, and mention of the close of that I'eligious order ou the coast. 'l'l1is work also was translated into EugHsh and some other languages. Juan l\laria Salvatierra, an Italian nobleman of Milan, and a- Jesuit, was at this time in Mexico. He was known as a man "of zealous faitb, of large mind, and of great patit>nce, and withal of a strong bodily constitution." While visiting the rnissiou of Sonora he met the Gernmn Jesuit Frimz Kuhn (called by the Spaniards Francisco Kino), who told him of the neglectll,l statt· of the country and of the misery of its inhabitants. This relation kindled in tlte mind of Rah·a. tierra a desire for Christianizing the Indians. He finally received permission to go to Califoruia, but nothing was to be expended from the royal treasury on his account. Salvatierra was poor, but a weaUby gentleman of Acapulco, Gil de la Sicrp('' placed at Jiii-.; disposal two vessels and a sum of money. He received contributions also from Europe. Pi,·c soldiers, several seamen, and some associates accompanied him, and, having 1u-ocuretl a mnmo11, with provisions for the expedition, he sailed, in 9ctobe:r, 1697, from Cinaloa to the coa1>t of California, and settled in latitude about 260 north, where he founded a mission which he called Sim Loretto. He preaohed to the Indians in their own language, baptized them, and resolved to pass his life in religious work. More than twenty times he crossed the Mar Vermejo, and was euahled · by the assistance of his friends in :Mexico to procure men, missionaries, a11d provisio~s, and to fomul several other missions on the eoa.st of California. Detween the years 1697 and 1716 he

expended in this work 300,000 "pesos duros," collected by himself and his pious companions from devoted individuah; aud corporations in sympathy with th{Cl cause. This was the first of several .Jesuit missions in Lower California. They attracted attention in Europe, aud were believed to be constituents of a powerful domination aiming at riches and · empire. Such was the accusation, and it resulted in the dissolution of tile order. What the Daue El{Nle did for Hreenland, Salvatierra effocted for California. He labored also for the exploration of the country, made excursions to the interior, and decided the long-standing rlonht concerning the peninsula, which by many was supposed to be an island. At. bis request, Father Kiuo trarnrsed the country from Sonora to the Hio Colorado. The usual residence of Kino was the mission of N eustra Sonora de Dolores, on tlte northern frontier of Sonora. Ill one of his journeys (iu the year 1700) he followed the course of the river Gila down to its junction with the_ Uolorado, but for want of provisions coul<l proceed uo further. Before retuming he ascended a mouutaiu, :rnd, looking westward and southward, saw continuouR land. Ve11eg·a8 says that with "a Rpy-gla;.;8" lie traced tile course of the Colorado to tlie gulf and recognized the mountains. Conviuced of foe continuity of land between Sonora a11d California, and assured also by tht> Indim1s of 11ifforent tribes assembled around him (about fh·e humlred in all), Kino yieliletl to the nect>S8ity forced on him by the sickness of his companions, as well as want of ])rovisions, awl returned home. Tlwuglt liigltly pleased, Salvatierra was not entirely satisfied with a conclusion based on a 1listm1t view. He reqnired practical proof. Notltiug less than actually walking around the gulf on dry land would thoroughly settle the q uestio11. The Fathers therefore proposed to S(~t out from Ki110'8 mis;;io11 DnloreH, in Sonora, walk around tl1e gulf, and down on itH western side to the mission or Salvatierra (San Loretto), in California. Salvatierra joined his companion at Sonora, and both sl't ont on thi;; expetlition from Dolores on the 1st of' March, 1701. Taking a route different from tlw one traYeled by Kiuo previously, they did not go as far north as the Gila, but turned weHtward to follow the shore of the gulf, and reached a sandy, waterless desert, in which tl1e party suffered with heat. The;\· were obliged, therefore, to conteut themselves with a view of the shores from an eleYation of the Sierra de Santa Clara, a mountain range, where the party assembled, and from thrnce.saw the coast of' California, the narrow northern end of the lake, an<l the mouth of the Oolora<lo, after which they returned to Dolores. At the eud of the same year, 1701, Father Kino again went north and followed the Gila and Colorado to aYoicl the saudy desert. He passed down the Colorado, lauded on t.l1e western shore, a!Hl in the country adjacent found only wide lllains aud saw hills in the distance, but. no appearance of any prolongatiou of the Gulf. The Jndi~us told him of the ocean, and showed him Rliells from the "contra costa," which, tltey said, could be reached in ten days' walking. Kino wisltt·d to make a journey to Monterey and also to Cape Mendocino, but being unable to cross the Uolomdo with horses and mules he wrote to Salvatierra from the western side of the river, and R1·11t the letter by an India11, t;nst-ing that it might be forwarded to San Loretto. 1ii 1702 Kino made the last of his excursions, and was then accom1mnied by Father Martin Oo11zalez. Again be reached the junction of the Gila and Colorado, and from thence passed along tlw eastPrn shore of the htst-named river, and reached its mouth, which until then Kino had only seen from afar. There many friendly Indians from the western side gathered around him, tlescrihed their country, its rivers aud mountains, and stating the distance to the ocean, invited him to Yisit their s~ttlemeut. But Kino was again prevented from going westward. His corn11auion, Gonzalez, fell sick and died, and was buried on the road. Occupied with missionary duties elsewhere, Kino wa;; unable afterwards to visit the northern end of the gulf. He die4 in 1710 and Father Salvatierra in 1717, leaving unsettled the question in regard to the coutinental character of California.
JUAN UGARTE, 17!21.

The Gulf of California had been partially examined. Its shores bad been looked at from the mast of some distant vessel, but tbe indentations were scarcely known. The fitst trarnler who gave particular attelJtion to such details was the Father, Juan Ugarte, who, in 1721, built two small vessels and sailed on the 15th of May from the Bay of San Dionisio

de Loretto. With the crews were lleveral who ~ad passed through the Strait of Magellan, and also an able and intelligent pilot, Guillermo Estrafort. Sailing north along the eastern coast of the gulf this party closely examined tlrn :,;hore1:1, corrected the errors of early maps, and after encountering dangers and difficulties reaehed t!Je mouth of the Colorado early in July. In the middle of that month they turned lmck, and ou tlie home voyage surveyed parts of the eastern and western shores of the Gulf. In September, li!!l, they arrived at the port of San Loretto, and there announced that between the Penimmla of California and the Province of Pimeria there was no water excepting that, of the ltio Colorado. Father Ugarte wrote an account of this expedition and appendeo to it the map of hhi pilot, Estrafort,. which map, sa,ys Venegas, he considered the principal result of the undertaking, but neither the narration nor the map seem to have been published.
1732.

The Jesuits had for a long period manifested interest in the exploration of the interior of the peninsula and of what, was then called "contra costa," or the seaward side of the peuimmla. They, in fact, inherited the purpose of forming some settlement for the benefit of the returning 1\lanilla galleons. Several "eutradas '' had been made, the first by Fath\',r Ugarte, after many difficulties, in the year 17u6, wheu a tract of about 20 leagues was surveyed near the twenty-fifth degree of north latitude. A company, conducted by the same Father, in 1712 founded not far from the oceau (at about 250 north latitude) the mission of Purissima Concepciou de Maria, and sul'Veyed part of the coast. In 1719 Father ClemPnte Guiken led a11 expedition to the vicinity of 24~ uorth latitude, and examined Bahia de Magdalena, which had been named by Vizcaino, aud notR,tl by him as one of the best protected ports in that region. In that neighbothood the mission of San Luis Gonzaga was established by the Jesuits. But the most interesting of the expeditions patronized by that order was accomplished by Sigismundo Taraval, in 1732. Born of noble parents l\t Todi, in Lombardy, Tara val was well instructed. In the year 1730, and when in the prime of manhood, he arrived in Ualifornia. The most northwesterly mission then maintained was at San Jgnacio, near 28 degrees north latitude, the care of which was confided to Taraval, with directions to explore the region beyond and open the way for similar establishments. Putting himself at the head of a company of baptized and friendly Indians, he traveled six days and reached a bay, which lie called Bahia de San Xavier, the latitude of which is not stated in the narrative. There he saw several small islands, distant 6 or 7 leagues from the coast; and after constrw.cting a balsa, sailed over to one of them but found only birds. So he named the group "Isla::; de Aves," i. Bird Islands. Another island, some leagues from these, in latitude about :n degrees north, be named "Isla de Neblinas," or Foggy Island. In the interior of this last was a considerable mountain which Taraval asceuded, and at a di8tanoe of 8 or 10 leagues saw a cluster of islands, which he named "Islas de los Dolores." Against the horizon other islands were seen at the north, which be supposed to be the Santa Barbara group, one of which had been called" Isla de Santa Catalina" by the navigator Vizcaino. There is little rluubt that the "Dolores " mentioned by Taraval were the Ooronados Islands. On the map of North America, in the third volume of the Histor.r of California by Veuegas, these islands are put down in latitude 32 degrees north, and are marked " Islas de los Dolores, reconocidas por el Padre Sigismundo Taraval en 1732." · The bay named by Taraval "Bahia de San Xavier" is not indicated on this or on any otlJCr map. Propably it is the small bay now known as San Diego Harbor. Venegas says that Vizcaino pa.ssed, perhaps in the night, from the harbor of San Diego to the Bay of San Xavier, and tbeu dis&vered near this bay the island of Catalina. After Tarnval no Jesuit missionary went so far north of Mexico. "We wished very much," says Venegas, "to found missions on the islands of the Santa Barbara Channel, seen b,y our father, but the distance was too great, and we had still t-00 much to do in our immediate vieinit~· .''

An expedition similar to that of Ugart;e in 1721 was undertaken by Father Feruando Consak, a native of Bohemia, in 1746. With four ea.noes, he &tarted from the bay of San Oarlos (latitude H.Ex.43-72

28 degrees north} on the 9th of .June. His undertaking closely resembles that of Ugarte, both in regard to route and as res1wcts th"' conclusions. Consak explored the coasts, bays, inlets, and islands along the eastem shore of Lower California, and on tbe lltl1 of .July arrived at the mout.II of the Colorado. He tril'<l to ascend the river with bis canoes, but the cu1rent was too strong for his oarsmen to admit of any cousiderable advance. He surveyed, however, 011 the return some parts of the gulf, all<l conHtructed a map, of which Vrnegas gives a copy in the third volume of his History of California. 1766.
AR no one had actually walked round the northern end of the Hnlf of California, so'me douht remained. To settle the matter tiually, Father Winceslans Link was sent, in 1766, to go by land. through th·~ peuinsula toward the Rio Colorado. He wa,s then in charge of the missiou of San Borgfa, trten the most northerly e8tablishment of the Jesuits. The journey wa8 commenced with sixteen Spanish soldiers and 011e hnndred Indians. After a weary march they reached a point 20 or ;30 leagues from the Colorado, and there hil' Indians were all sick; his horses and mules 11ied, and the soldiers were _Ao 11:uch dispirited that Link was obliged to retrace his steps. As far as could be seen, howe;·er, lw discovered only sandy plains about the north end of the gnlf, and like those who prf\eeded him, it was reported to be landlocked. From his time Lower California has been uni,·ersally known as a peninsula. A few ye;us after this the Jesuit8 were forced to leave the eonntr~' which they had explored, cultivatecl, and peacefully governed. For some years an opinion prevailed in Europe that the Jesnit8 hail in California and in Paraguay, iiowcrful and populous empires, and that enormous wealth had \Jepn derived from their golcl mines and pearl fisherietl. "\\7 heu therefortl the dissolution of the order throughout the world was decreed, the viceroy of Mexico (in 1767) sent an armed force, under Dou Gaspar de Port-0la, to California, with directions to seize the country in the King's name and assume jurisdiction as Royal Governor. The .Tesnits were arrested at tlteir several missions aud sent to Spain. Some 1wrisbed, and others, after muclt suffering, reached Europe. Portola was not resisted, but he found instead of the expected El Dorado, a very poor, rocky country, with only wild tribes of Jndians, who had made under the guidance of the Jesuits, their first advances toward civili· zation. Franciscan friars were substituted for the displaced missionaries, and the work of colonizatiou inclined toward the far uorthwm;t, In the course of twenty-five years that region was rapidly developed.
RUSSIAN EXPEDITIONS.

The Jesuits, by their settlements and exploration of the peninsula and Gulf of California, laid a foundation for farther prn~ress towards the northwest. Two European nations, the Russians and tlie French, adYauced from opposite directions to the same region. Their enterprises influenced the ideas of geographers, and moved the Spauish Government to make a final exploration of that part of the countr_y. A sketch will suffice to mark the diseoveries made by Russians in their expeditions from Siberia. CosRacks had passHd the Ural Mountains and commenced au easterly movement at the eud of the sixteenth century. They traverse<l Siberia and arrived on the shores of the Northern Pacific by t.hr middle of the seventeenth century. One of these named Deschnew, as early as 1640, sailed t.hrough Bering Strait, but left no detailed account of his a<lventures. Others followed, aud by reaching the peninsula of Kamtchatka gave the Oossacks some notion of lands eaat of Siberia. There had been amougst, t.hem the rumor of an "eastern country or island," with large rivers and forests in which were fur-bearing -animals. The enterprising monarch, Peter the Great, formed a plan for the exploration of the region, but his death not long afterwards devolved the execution of the scheme upon his successor. In 1728 Capt. Victus Bering, chosen by the Emperor Peter for the nnderta.king, sailed from Kamtchatka and took a northeasterly course. He saw only the western part of the gnlf which bea.rs his name,_ crossed the strait dividing Asia from America (traversed by Deschnew),

and reached, at the sixty-sixth parallel, a promontory which he believed to be the most northern headland of Asia. From that point he returned home. In the time of the Empres1S Elizabeth (1741), a more important expedition mo,·ed, under command of the same Beriug. With two ships, one in charge of Captaiu Tschirikow, a Hnr;sian, he sailed from Kamtchatka in a southern and eastern direction. The ,·essels were soon separated by a storm, but both rea-0hed the coast of America, though at different points. Bering made land uuder 60 degrees uortb latitude, in the neighborhood of a larg·e mountain, called since his time Mount Saint Elias, and Tschirikow at 5ti degrees north latitude touched on one of the it>lawl:-; now known as the Prince of '\Vales Archipelago; but neither of the corrnnauders could go farther. Their crews were sick and their means of subsistence exhausted. Ou the home voyage they saw some of the Aleutian Islands. On a small island west of them Bering wai.; wrecked aud tlied, but his crew and Captain 'l'schirikow's returned safely to Kamtchatka before the end of J 741, bearing the news of their discoveries to Europe. The operations last mentioned resulted in the iutroductiou of a uew for-bearing animal, the sea otter, which soon became one of the chief inducements for foture expeditions and explorations in the northwest. On the island where Bering died his crew killet1 many of these animals, and in China sold the skins at large prices. The Russian Government did not at once follow up the geographical discoveries of Bering, hut enterprising individuals fitted out private expeditions to hunt the otter. None of thei;e. reached the coasts visited by Bering and Tschirikow, hut they explored the Aleutian Islands autl brought home some sketches and maps. In 1764 the Russians occupied the penini;ula of Aliaska, on the coutinent of A.merica, wistakiug it for an island, and formml different trading establishme11ts and hm1tiug- stations. At length thei;e attracted the attention of the Russian Government, and induced an ofticial inYestigation in regard to their extent and connection with other countries. By order of the Empress Catha,rine II, expeditions were dispatched ahont the time of Hie ex1mlsion of the Jesuits from California, and the substitution of more active explorers (tlie Franciscan missionaries) to fill places vacated by that religious order. The first was >lent in 1766-'67, under command of Lieutenant Synd, and the second iu 1768, in eharge oi Captain Krinitz;yn and J.,im1tenant I... ewashoff. But these navigator!-\ failed in attempting to reacll the latitudes attained by Bering and Tschirikow. They effected nothing· except a little irnprornment in the knowledge of the position and condition of the Aleutian fur islands. The attentiou of r,he Spanish Government, anxious to preserve aml defend its old prutensious to the possession ot' the Pacific, was excited by these movements. They were regarded as iuYasions of Spanish California.
FRENCH EXPEDITIONS.

The expeditions of the French, sent out westward from Canada, \tll(l their discoYeries, like those of the Russians, could not but influence the views held in regard to the nature and con· figuratiou of the northwestern coast. On the Saint Lawrence the Freucb were told of a great expanse of water at the westward, and tbey supposed it to be tlie Pacific Ocean, as, accordi11g to opinions then prevalent, the continent was not of -Yery great breadth. The first English settlers in Virginia believed that beyond the Alleghany Mouutains there was a large sea, supposetl b,v some to be the Pacific, by others onl.v a bay or branch of the Gulf of Cortes (Californian Gulf), aml that supposed sea is marked on some of the early maps of Virgiuia. The Fre1rnh had found that the so-called "Great Sea" was merely a series of lakes. Iu 1673, b~· passing the Missi8Sippi they disproved also the supposition in regard to the proximity of the Pacific. Its coast was, however, in imagination: removed only so far west as was made needful in representation by positive evidence. It remained a tiworite idea with the Cauadian, French, and Virginian English that the continental breadth was not great, aud at each step west,ward they expected to find water courses running in that direction. In the year 1683, soon after the disoovery of the Mississippi, a French traveler, the Baron La.honlan, while exploring the river ".Moingona" (perhaps the Minuesota), met. some Indiaus who t.old him of a river running westward. One of them painted upon a buffalo skin a map of the

ri\·er with its mouth opening into a large expanse of water; and on the shores of that expanse were towns and trading vessels. Tllis story is like the vision of the Spaniard, Ooronado, who also saw salt water at the west, with great gilded trading ships. Lahonlan brought home a map, and we see in consequence on French publications of that day a great western river not far from the Mississippi, an<l in addition the shore of a broad stretch of salt water, but whether intended for a large inland lake (Utah t) or part of the Californian gulf, or the Pacific itshlf, cannot be decided. lu 17'.!I CharleYoix, a French Jeimit, went down the Mi8sissippi, and was told by Indiam; near the month of the Missouri that they had been westward and found its source in very high mountaiwi, 011 the other side of which was a stream flowing towards the west. A similar but more cir1·.u111sta11t.ial account of this western river was given by an Indian to Du Pratz, another French. tran~ler, in 1735. He called it Tacoutche 'ressee, and Raid he had traveled from its source to its u10ntl1, or as far dowu as the great water towards the setting sun. Amongst Indians on the upper waters of the )1issouri some French voyagers saw sea-shells, which had probably come from hand to hand ornr the U.ocky Mountains to the valley of the Mississippi, and these were considered as sure indications that an ocean existed in the west. In the northwest the French discovered and traced the river of the Assinaboines ancl the Saskatchawan, obtained some knowledge of the Rocky Mountains, arnl also heard again of the "Hreat H,iver of the West." · Amongst the travelers in that region was the Chevalier de la Verenderye, a man of enterprisi11g 8pirit,, who, with his sons, mauifosted steady interest iu geographical development, but it is not probable that he actually reached the mountains. He went far in that direction, and pictured them on his map, as also the river of the west, which is represented as an outflow of Lake vYinnipeg. The French map-makers who followed his indications, as, for exam.tile, N. Bellin, in li43, not only sketched the river, but added some parts of the coast of the Pacific, which they adopted as the western boundary of La Nouvelle France, or" Uanada." Opinions respecting the mouth of the river were as various as those held in regard to the source. Some thought that it led to the harbor of San Francisco, where two western rivers do in fact join their waters. Others supposed it t-0 flow in the opl'Iling seen by Martin d' Aguilar, and some bad in view an outlet towards the Strait of .Tuan de Fnca. The Englisl1 traveler Carver, who, like Verenderye, set out intending to reach the Pacific, ,;ayo;: ''The rfrer Oregon, or River of the Wei.t, falls into the Pacific Ocean at the Strait of Anian." Miiller, the able Herman historian of Hussian dh;coveries, sa.rs: "According to my opinion, the much i<poken of Great R.iver of the West falls into the ocean opposite either to Kamtcbatka or the con11tr,y of the Tschnktschi.'' Spaniards showed on maps of the country northwest of Mexico some large rivers, but the <lin·etions are marked as uncertain. Their names are Rio Dolores, Rio Buenaventura, Rio San Felipe, Rio Los Monges, and others. Some believed these to be indepe11dent streams, but others supposed tl1ey were branches of one large river, probably the Oregon, mentioned by Carver, or, ai,; name1l by the J<'rench, "Riviere de l'Ouest." The French lost control in Canada before their explorations could be extended from the Saint La:wrence and Mississippi towards the Pacific. Others completed the work, will be mentioned hereafter. Neither the expeditions of the Jesuits nor those of the Russians or French at this pcriotl reachetl the middle of the northwestern coast of .America, though many speculations and h_ypothe:se.s were starte.d h_y them. '!'here remained an immense tract as little known in 1750 as it11ad been at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Before alluding to further operations, two enterprises of this period will he touched on, namely, the apocryphal discoveries of the socalled Admiral Fonte, and the expedition to Ualifornia under the astronomer Ohappe. The so-called voyages and discoveries of .Admiral Fonte have no historical foundation. Before the year 1708 no one had heard of such a person. Then it was for the first time mentioned that he had made important discoveries in the year 1640: When first told the story gained little attention, bat in 1750 the two eminent French geographers De l'lsle and Bua.che declared their belief and brought the details before the Academy of France, aud the l!ltory a.ttrooted much attention. Even the Spanish Jesuit8 in California occupied themselves towards the close of their tenure

with the subject. It seems proper, therefore, to mention it, which may be <lone briefly, as Venegas, the annalist of the Californian Jesuits, gives a treatise 011 De Fonte iu hi1:1 thircl volumP. Of De Fonte's pret<:>nded discoyeries noue but that of the Rio de los Re_v1:>s was ever deemed plausible. In 1708, without signature or mention of authority, an rnnglish periodical, "Tlw M.onthl;y Miscellany or Memoirs of the CuriouR," contained an article eutitled."A NarratiYe," in which a certain Admiral BartolomP de Fonte or Fueute rl:'lates that he waR seut b~v order of the King of Spain and tht· Viceroy of Peru, in the .rear Hi40, to make di1:1co,·erie1:< 011 the uorthwestel'll coast of America; that he had sailed i11 furtherance along the coast of California, and reacl1ed, at about ;)~~ deg-ree8 north latitude, the month of a great ri\"er, which he named llio dl' los Reyes, aud 011rmsite to this a largp. archipelago, which he called "Sau Lazaro." He further states tlrnt he eutere(l the rirnr and passing uort.heast dh,;covered lakes, channels, alHl other waters, to eaeli of which llP gaxe a 1mme~ and at last leaving his ve1:1sel iu oue of tht lakes he traveled overland to Hudson's Bay, wherP he found a ship from Boston in New England. The narrative adds that while De Foutf' was on his extra ordinary journe.r, one of bis officers made at the north similar <fo~coveriBs of channels, lakei-i, and passages from the Pacific into the northern waters, that he had given names to all of them, and described each of them minutely in his report to the Admiral. The fiction here mentioned would not be worthJ· <Jf notice if such intelligent men a;.; T. X. dt> l'Isle and Philippe Buache had not. brought the matter before the Academy of France, an<l 1h1clared their belief in its authenticity. English writers ha,·e made it prollable that tlw story was fnrnh;hed by Mr. James Petiver, the uaturalist, wbose taste and talents for sueh productio11s were well known. When eminent French geographers issued a map sho\"l'ing the pretende(l disc<n-eriei:< of De Fonte, of course they had imitators. Jefferys, Brouckncr, and Beruouille, among otheris, adopted the whole or part, copied the map, and ga,·e the names ''Archipelago tle San Lazaro," "R1o de los Reyes," and others, thus perpetuating the fable aud promulg~tt.iug it to tlI<' world.
1769.

1-'b.e voyage of the astronomer, M. Chapped' Auteroche, was one of sernral made to different parts of the globe for the purpose of observiug the transit of Yen us which occurred on the 3d of June, 1769. The French Academy was at the head of the enterprise, and wished to ha Ye observatiomi made on one of the Spanish Son th Sea f sland:..;, but permis8ion beiug refnsell, the peninsula of Oalifornia was chosen instead, and there the court of Spaiu was willing to lend a l11>lping llall(l. So a combined expedition was arranged, of Spanish aud French obset.\'Prs, and the direction was given to Chappe, who had previously made a vo;ra.ge to Siberia in the interest of as.tronomy. For the observations of 1769 he was amply provided with astronomical and mathematical instruments, and he was accompanied by a French gl\Ographical engineer and a watchmaker. Two Spanish astronomers, M. Doz and l\I. l\Iediua, joined him at Oacliz on his wa.r to the New \Vorld. The party expec:ted to sail in one of the ship8 of the great Spanish fleet de.'ltiued for Yern Cruz, but its departure being deferred from week to week, the time for the transit of ,~ euus dr1>w 1:10 near that a vessel was hastily made ready, and they sailed to Mexico and iu a miserable condition landed on the 8th of March, 1769. With a caravan of mules the instruments were trani;ported to the harbor of Sai1 Blas, and after long detention by calms and high winds the party 1·eached the shore of the peninsula of California a.ta point near the mission of Saint Joseph, where, hadug some time left, they erected obl'lervatories in barns and under tents. Favored by serene skies, M. Ohappe had the good fortunl"1 t.o record r1 series of satisfactor~· observations on the transit and noted other astronomical pbeuomena, amongst which was a lnuar eclipse and the immersion of one of Jupiter's satellites. All these and an interesting narrative of the expedition were made known to the scientific world by Cassini. The preparations of Chappe had boon methodical, and his obsenations were made with_ scrupulous exactness. The Spanish aatronomerB pursued their operations separately. From all the ohserva.t.ions the geogmphical position of San Joseph proved to be 230 3' 20" N. and 1120 !,!' 30 11 west of Paris. But the best Mexican ebarts of that time varied much from this result, differing as much as three degrees in longitude and more tha.n a degree in latitude.

According to calculations resulting from the observations of CLappe, "\Vestern America was found to he uearer to Europe than preYions estimates by about four degrees of longitude. The result became a 14an<lanl for all subsequent Slll'\'P,Ying operations. Jn 1793, when Vancouver fini8he<l his survey of the northwestern coast, lie repaired to Cape San [incas and the vicinity of Saint Joseph, in order to compare his results for position with those obtained b~- Chappe in 1769. \\rllile the last-named observer was en·gaged 011 tlle peninsula a malignaut epidemic. raged.

:Fear of the progress of the Russians in the racific, the expulsion of the Jesuits from Califomii1, aud Hie zeal in missionary work eYinced by their successors, the Franciscan friars, [twakened aotivit.v which was not a,gain iutt·rrupted until tlie coast w~s thoroughly explored. Year after year one expeditio11 followed auother, Enropeau oat.ions concurring, and at the end of the century nearly all the "wy8teries of t,he we8t" lay open before the world. Alarm at Ru:,;siau progre8S had drawn the Spaniards to the northwest, and they had previously moYed northeast (on the American continent) in consequence of the advances of the'French. To clrnck these in thi1 Yalley of the l\IissisAippi the Spanish sent expeditions which resulted in the settlement of western Texas. In 1762 they acquired from France the cession of the western half of the Mississippi country, and detachments of Spanish dragoons, missionaries, and trad~men from ~ ew Mexico went 80metimes as far north as the fiftieth parallel. At this time they se~med willing to take pos8essio11 of a continent conferred on them b;r a Papal bull at the eud of the fifteenth centUl'j'. But this was merely as the last brightening of a flame before its extinction. The l\larqnis de Croix, Viceroy of Mexico, who, in 1767, ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits from California, aud ga,·e their missions ~HHl settlements to tile Fra11ci8cans, directed the latter to advance towanls the northwest. "\Varrned by the triumph over their rivals, the F'rarn,iiscans manifested great zeal. An enterprise was planned by t,I1eir superior, Joseph de Galvez, with the approbation of the Viceroy, wbo was, howevu, succeeded in office by Don Antonio Maria de Bucarrelli in 1771, a mau uot less active iu promoting geographimtl exploration and missions. By thl· t·xcrtionii of these men was carried into effect, in the course of six or eight years, the long def<ired scttlemcHt, cultivation, and explorMiou of what tho Jesuits had called the" Contra Costa." The history of the labors and sufferings of the Franciscan friars and their companions is highly iuterestiug. The :i.ims and results at which they arrived served an important end in allrnucing the hj·llrogmplty of the coast.. Peaceful and comparatively strong, the missions became fu!t~rums of ei\·i1izatio11 in that region and desirable supports for subsequent northwestern voyages. Spani8h explorers returning exhausted, as also English, French, and other nationalities, relied on these e>itablishments. Vancouver would probably haYe perished but for the succor atforded by the Fmne<i.8cans in California, antl the l~ussians relied ou them for provisions. Agents of the Hudson Ba.~' Compan,y traYeled from the Columbia River for supplies. In short, these missions were the basis of t·mpire. \Vithout them the United Stares would have found it much more diffi· cult to establish government iu that part of it.s territory. All American travelers in the beginning of tile prest·nt ce11tury reptiirell to tltei:oe llospitable settlements, as the mariners, the Russia.us, and tbe Uana.diarn,; did, asking for bread and for succor when exhausted; and many doubtless would have i>erished if the I1'rancisca11s llad not 1>rm·iously dotted the·c,'Oast line with cultivat;ed patchrs, cattle, peaceful India11s, and homes. It would be interesting to follow the history of these missions, but our main interest here relat~s to the land and sea expeditions by which they were established.

It was concerted between the Viceroy and the Superior of the Franci.~can ronventl'I (.lose a.~ GaJyez) that three missious should be fouu<led, one at San Diego, auotlwr at Monterey, ancl a third midway between the two, both of which had been pronounced by Vizeaiuo, a hundred and fifty years earlier, as well adapted for the intended purpose. The middle station waH called San Buenaventura. Two expeditions were to be sent out at the same iime, one from the peninsula, by land, the other by sea from San Blas. GaJvez himRelf superintended the aN'angements for both. The land expedition wai; to conduct the principal missionaries with soldiers aud cattle, lay ont a road, an<l hegin friendl? intercourse with the Indian tribes 011 the way. Thi8 was under command of Don Gaspar de Portola, the captain of dragoons, who had been charged to expel the ,Jesuits from Lower California. He was supported hy other officer:;, some soldiers, aud St>vera.l missionaries, under the ~upervision ot' Father Junipero Serra, who was con:stituted president of the new missions. The.v· set out in two divisions, the smaller au exploring party under the conduct of Dou Fernando Riv<·ra and Moncada going in advauce. The priucipal body, comrn:w<lt>d by Portola, followed on the 1.'ith of Ma;y, 1769, from the .Mission de San Fernando eu Yclicata, the most northern settleme11t iu Lower California. Thfa had heen founded only a short time before their departure. The track of the old Jesuit traveler, Father \Vencesli:»us Link, was followed to the neighborhood of the Colorado. From thence, taki11g a northwesterly dire~tion, they arrived on the 1st of .Jnly, 176!1, after forty·six days' travel, at the Rhore of a hay recognized by th rm as tlle harbor of San Diego, aeeording to the ol<l maps and charts, and there they found t11~ sea expr.ditiou at auchor. The sea expedition was intended to aid that on land by carr:dng out more soldiers, provisions, and implements. They were also to survey, or, as that operation was then expressed, "register the coast" (a tracer el registro de la Costa). Foc this purpose three ships were fittd out from San Blas: The San Carlos, San Antonio, and San Joseph. The principal Yessel carried Don Vicente Vila, commander-in-chief of the expedition, and the st>coud, Capt. Don Juaz Perez, who was afterwards one of the most active among the explorers and navigators of the northwestern coast. The three ships sailed on separate days. Perez, in the San Antonio, arri·ed at San Diego Ba,r on the 11th of April. The Sau Carlos started more than a month earlier, but was a fortnight behind the San Autnnio, the captain of the San Carlos, judging from "the indicationr- of the old maps'' that the port of San Diego was between 330 and 34° of lHtitu<le, hnt he found it at 320 40' He lost, therefore, much time, and did not discover his error until hiR crew was much wasted bysickness, hunger, aud fatigue. Some of the crew <lied on this voyage. The third ve8sel (San ,Joseph) was never seen or heard of after sailing. The members 'of the two experlitions rejoieed in heing united, but as a voyage to Monterey was out of the question, the San A utonio was marmrnl, and Juan Perez sailed in t.hat vessel on the 9th of ,luly from Sau Diego southward to lwocm·e provisions and hands. When the ships were found unavailable, and tbe San Antonio had 8ailed homeward, Portola determined to march northward, moving on the 14th of Jul.)', 1769, iu search of Monterey. Part of the company was left at Sau Diego with Father J unipero Serra to form the intended scttlt·mm1t and mission and to negotiate with the surrounding Indians. He started with some soldiers aud missionaries, including Friar Juan Crespi, the journalist of this and other Franciscan expeditions, and traveled slowly along the coast, accompanied. by a train of' mules and man_)· friend!~· Indians. Passing the Sierra of Santa Lucia, they came in sight of the harbor of Moutere;y on the 1st of October. Men were sent to reconnoiter the bay, but could find nothillg answering the description of the port of Monterey as given bj' the pilot, Cabrero Bueno, which was their only guide. The open bay they thought could scarcely be called a "port," and if Mcmterey was to be found they must look for it farther north. Portola was very anxious, as he hoped to find there th0 l::lan .Joseph, of the loss of which vessel he was yet ignorant. He therefore continued liis march northward, though many of bis followers were sick with scurvy; and thus "they tumed their backs on the very port they were in search of."

On the last day of Oc.tober they were within sight of the Farallones off San Francisco entrance, "the signs of which, being eompared with the remarks of the pilot, Cabrero Bueno, were found to be exact." They were then convinced that they had left Monterey to southward, and on the 11th of No>ember tlw,v tur1wd in that direction and reached the bay, some of the party now believiug it to he Monterey. There they remained until the 10th of December, waiting for the San .Joseph, but no Yessel arrived. The Si..,rra of Santa Lucia was already covered with snow, and Portola kept on towards the eouth. H seeiilS probable that once during this expedition the party was on the 8hore of the lrnrbor hut could uot identify the place. They arrived at San Diego on the 24th of .Jnnnary, 1770, after more than six months of travel and trouble, having been driven by hunger to eat their mules a1111 horses on the way. Some of the party reported that the harbor of Monterey had probahl3' been clurnged since the time of Vizcaino, as the spot so named on bis map had been found filled with sand hills. · The ship San Antonio returned, as before related, to Mexico, and reached San Blas towards the end of July, 1769. From thence it wa,s again dispatched, under command of Juan Perez, early in the year 1770, with prm'isious to Monterey, where it was suppmicd the land expedition had meanwhile arri\'ed. But on touching at a point on the Santa Barbara channel to procure fresh water, Perez was told hy the Indians that the expedition had gone back to San Diego, and having lost an auehor whieh he hoped migllt be replaced there, he was induced to steer for that harbor, and reached it on the 23d of March, barely in time to save the enterprise, as Portola and his party, destitute of any means of suhsistence, had fixed upon that very day to go Routh and abandon the attempt at settlement. When the two branches of the expedition united at San Diego with replenished means they agreed to set ont again for Monterey. Perez sailed in the San Antonio on the 16th of April, 1770, accompanied by :Father ,Tunipero Serra. They were fon;ed back by storms to the thirtieth parallel, where they found more favorable wimls, and after six weeks of tedious navigation they entered Monterey on the 31st of May, being as far as we know the first Europeans who did so in a period of one hundred and sixty-seven years which elapsed after the visit of Vizcaino. Portola and his party, including Father Crespi, the journalist of the expedition, left San Diego the day after the San Antonio sailed. They reached Monterey, where the vessel awaited them, and the reunited miKsionaries founded there the mi:ssion of San Carlos de Monterey, or the Royal Pmt of' San Carlos. Names were given at this time to some small rivers, valleys, and other places, hut they are not all meutione<l in the narrative of the expedition. Early in August, 1i70, the action at Monterey became known in Mexico, and the joy of the authorities there was 8nch that they ordered a general ringing of the bells and a great festival. l\lasll was celebrated and a procession formed in which the. Viceroy and all the tribunals joined. A proclamation was printed and distributed, giving a short description of the travels and dis· cornries of Portola and the mission~ries, and announcing that the dominions of the King of Spain had heen exte11de1l 300 lea.gues along the coast towards the north. Pl·rez had sailed from Monterey in the San Antonio on the 9th of ,July, 1770, to return t-0 Mexico and bring from thence pro,'iMions. On reaching San Blas he gave int.dligence of the i>roceedingt'l at l\Iouterey. From San BlaR he was again sent, early in the year 1771, to Monterey, and there arrh'l'd with tm1 other missionaries on the 14th of April. On the 7th of July, 1771, lte went to San Diego with dispatches, and from that place returned to San Blas with invalid missionaries. Father ,J n11i1wro Serra occnpie1l the time after his arrival at Monterey by making excursions into t,lw adjacent, country, visiting Indian tribes, and seeking convenient sites for missions. Every mission thus founded was combine<l with previous explorations, and served also for extending geographical knowledge. Serra explored the valley of the Rio Carmelo near Monterey, and transferred to that rn.lley his mission of San Carlos, the first p08ition of which was further northeast. Vfith other friars he visited the Sierra de Santa Lucia, and there settled the mission of San Antonio de Padua. He celebrated mass on the 14th of July, the day of San Buenaventura.. The mission of San Gabriel was established at the end of the summer of 1771. Having somewhat advanced towards the south the chain of missions And settlements by whieh he intended to connect Mexico and Upper California, Father Junipero turned his attention to the

nortb. An expedition in tbat dirootiou was agreed upon with the military commander Dou Pedro FageF>, who with some soldiers aml the friar Crespi started from :.\fontereJ on the 20th of Marnh, 1772. Tue latt.er wrote a journal of the expeditiou which shows that the enterprise was very unfortunate. Part of the country was sun·e;yed, 01· "rt'gistered," wheu the work was interrupted lJy a report from San Diego of famine and sic.kueS1S, aud the contemplated abandonment of that port. 'l'he party consequently returned as soon as possible. Aftt>r returuiug with the invalids to San Blas at the en<l of the sumwer of 1771, .Perez was aguiu employed, eal·ly iu the following year, t-0 carry proYisions to l\fouterey; but the bad condition of his ships and unfavorable weather made it impoi;sible to attempt the passage arouud I'oiut Conception. Instead, therefore, of making his destined port he carrietl the provisions to Sa.n Diego, which settlement, 011 the brink of ruin, was thus saved hy him a second time. Information was sent to Father SeITa in Monterey of the arrh·a.I of these supplies, and a request that they should be sent for by land, because of the d1ftlculty and danger of water transportation; bttt the father, though now old an<l somewhat infirm, jourueyetl iu person to the latter place and persuaded Perez to trust in God, nut,withstandiug the bad seasou, and attempt once more the voyage to Monterey, as tlie statiou must be almudoned nu less the much needed proviNiom; should soon arri rn. Yielding to the pro.11ptings of Serra's f<lith and zeal, Perez agaiu set sail, arrfred in safety, antl after lauding his c;.irgo returued to Sau Blas. In 1772 Father Junipero founded the mission of Sa11 Luis Obispo de Tolosa at the south of Mouterny; and afwr visitiug the otlaer missions resolved to retn u to Mexico for conference with tho 11ew Vicerny, UOll Anto11iv Maria. de Buca.relli, who had su~:eeded the Marquis de Croix, the fu1·11HT pat1·011 .of St'rra'~ eutt>rpriise, mid who was isupposed to lJe unacquainted with the im1}ortauce of western mis:siouB and explmations. Junipero explained to the Viceroy the political importance of the mi:ssious, found ready audience, and procured all the ai1l desired. Perez was sent oot again with supplies, but bis voyage was unfortunate. Driven by storms to Ute pe11i11sula be was constrained to unload his vessel<i, and the friars aud soldiers depoudeut on him for supplies elsewhere antlered grj;\atly from hunger.

At t11e rPqnest of Father .Tunipero, the Viceroy of Mexico hiid also i;::ent an order to the commander of the northern frontier of Sonora to fit out an expedition for Mo11tcre.r, 111111 to trae~· n11 overlaud route in tllat direction, so that missio11s might not he entirely dependent ou Wt\ather, commtmicat_ion with Me}tico 111> to that time having boon eitber by sea, around Cape Sau Lucas, or half way by land to Velicata and Sau Loretto iu Lower California, and from thence us water.

He arrived in April, 1774, having on tbe way traced out a new land route between California and New Mexico through Sonora. Partly at the suggestion of Father Juuipero, the Viceroy was induced to furnish a larger expedition. The Santiago, n new ship, was fitted out anti placed under the command of Juan Perez, bound to San Diego and Monterey, from whence the captain was to proceed to higher latitudes. I.n this ship, which s~iled from San Blas on the 24t~1.of January, 1774, Father Junipcro returnp(l to bi:s mission.

A journe>· was made in 1775 by a Carmelite friar, Francisco Garces, and thereh;y anothn way of communication was opened towards the interior. Father Garces traveled from Sonora through the Colorado countrs, saw the southern end of the Sierra Ne,·ada, and discovered iu the interior of California, a river which }14> called Rio de San Felipe (perhaps the upper part of tbe San .Toaquiu ), and 1msRing 011 to San Diego he returned from thence to Sonora.

Both of the ships sailed from Sau Blas on the 16th of March, 1775, with orders to proceed along the northwest coa>:.t as far m,; the sixty.fifth parallel if possible. On tlH· first part of tLe vo_yage thl\Y were accornpauied b,y tile packet San Carlos, w!Jicb n·ssel was bound to M011tcrey and San Francisco in charge of Don :\Iignel Manrique. But nnfortu11atel;i· that officer was seized with insanity a short time after !Jc left San Blas. The command of hii,; ve<ssel WflS gh·eu to Ayala, and Bodega took the vlace of the latter in the Sm1ora. Tlrns Bodega became prominent in the expedition. A:mla, by taking the San Carlos into Monterey and San Francisco, was; sqiarated from it, and at, tlla-t time made the first sune~· of the bay of San :Francisco. After separating from the San Carlos, the two remaining suips sailed to the northwest and had 011 board for information tLe history of California, by Veuegas; also a map o1 the :French geographer, lkllin, which "\Yas fotmd Hry unreliable and fanciful." They had also tlle c!Jart made b~· their predernssor, Perez, who acconipanied them on this \oyage. On tlie coast north of Mendocino they found a small bttrbor iu 41 o 07' north latitude, which they entered ou the 5th of June. In the course of a tew <la~;s they surw~·ed the harbor, and erected a cross on the shore, an(l named the harbor Holy Trinit~·. A riYer emptying into it was called l1y them Rio de las Tortolas, or Pigeon RiYer, from the large flocks of those birds seen tlwre. TLey sailed further north, looking as they went for the inlet warked on their map as De Fuca'H Strait, and reached tlw coast in latitude 470 24' north, where a party from tlie crew of the Sonora \rHs seut on ;;Jwre for frt·8h water. 'rhey were attacked b_y tlw natin·;;: a11d seYe11 of the ere\\- were ki lle11. Tlie ;;a Y<1 ges <lpprared to be numerous; the landing wai; difticult; heill'e the murcll'r was not Mcuge<l, au<l keeping <JU to the uorth west the unfortunate spot was named Isla de Dolores. On some Spanish maps the place is marked as Eusenda de los l\Iartires (Inlet of the Mart~Ts); an<l is probabl.v tl1e locaJit,y afterwar<ls and even yet called Destruction faland. Ou the 1st of August, and when in about 50 degrees north latitude, the ships separated in yery thick weather. Aftt>r seeking each other i11 vai11, Bodega and Maurene, in the Sonora, resolved to 1;ail uorthward, but Ileceta, in the Santiago, despairing· of snceess, turned back to the soutl1wanl. In latitude 570 04' uorth, Bodega saw a high mountain, and m\me1l it San Jacinto. The same was afterwards called by Captain Cook Mount B<lgecombe. Iu latitnde ;)5 8 30' north a spaeionl' bay was named, in }J011or of tlie viceroy of 1Hexico1 Port Jfocarelli. Other localitiPs were at thi1' time named by the Spanish explorers in this neighborhood, but the~· are now of no special intpr4·r;t, Tl1e highest latitude rt>ached h~· Bodega was 58 degn·es north. There his mean1> were exliansred and he tnrned southward. On the 19th of September be was again in sight of the coast of California, in latitude 47 degrees north. Keeping on sont1Jwan1 he reached an entrance in latitude :1so IS' north, and supposed it to be San Francisco, but the great sea-inark, the Faralloues, not lieinl!,' in view, bis error became apparent to all in the i)arty. A cape north of the port before him was called Puuta de ArenaR, and to the port itself was given the name Puerto de Bodega. It was 11ow tl1e 4th of October, and without entering at the Golden Gate, he passed on to Moutere,1. The most interesting event of the expedition occurred on the return voyage. Ou the lfith of August Hec~eta 8aw the month of the Uolumbia River, but was unable to enter. SuppoRiug it to he tlie moutb of some large river ur strait, be ralled it, the Bay of AsRumption. On later map>; it is named Entrada cle Heceta, but on some Rio <le Sau Roque, from the promontory north of it, to which Heceta had given the uame San Roque. Both minwi; are from the church calendar, that of the Assumption on tlw 15th of August and San H.oque's the next da.y. Hooeta called the south cape of the inlet Cabo Proudoso, or Leaf)' Cape; lmt at this day it is known as Point Adams. He thought the oywuiug might be the Strait of ,Juan Ile Fncil. l:'lonth· ward of this he S<lW another hea1lla111l, a.ml rmurnd it Da.ln J<'a,lcon (now C:tpe Iiookout), and continuing his course Heceta reache(l Montert>.y on the 30th of August.

SAN FRANCISCO DAY, 1775.

The packet ship San Carlo11, in charge of Dou Juau de Ayala, a commander of the Royal Spanish N11v~,, after leaving provisioos at Montert>y for the uses of tl1e missiouaries, was directed to make-a survey of the blly of San Francisco, for the couvenieuce of otJ1er mission;; that uy onler of the Vicnoy were soon t-0 be founded. Ayala 1nrind at Montere;v on the 27th of .June, 1775, discharged his-0argo, and sailed prornptlJ' to rletermine (says Father Pal u) "whethn the canal which bad beeu imperfectly seen from a distance by tlw former laud e:xvediti<>n wus really an outlet to the sea, or not." Nine days afte.r lt>aving Monterey lie found the outlet ofibe ca11al, which he calle,l the Inlet of the Farallones; aud the Sau Uarlos passed safely throngb in the night. Thus, as fal· as can be uow kuowu, AJ·ala was t11e first Euro1wan who entered San Fruncisco Bay. Perez in the pttceding ;rear 11ad passed h~', and tbe Franciscan friars on their land exrwdition, in 1769 and 1772, bad merely seen the interior basin from the h1ml side. Ayala reported the inlet of the Farallones as being "a Spanish league long and a quarter of a league broad, with strong currents issuing or entering, according to low or high water; arnl behind it a little Mediterranean SM with two arms, one stretching 15 leagues to the southward, and the other 5 lea~ues to the north; and, again, beyond this he discovered the j!reat bay 10 lt>agues bl'Oad, and another bay of a round figure [San Pablo Bay], into which em1ities tbe great Rio de Nuestro Padre San Frimcisco;" i.e., the Sacramento River. Doubtless Karquim.·s Strait was mistakf>n for the month of the Sacramento. He remained in the hay forty d11j"l'l exploring in a hoat, and "registering" the large sheet of water. The Iudians on shore Kt><·111t·d to he frien<ll~-. After cumplt·ting his "phm '' oft he hay, t Le eut ranee of which, aeeor<lill;!' to li is det <'r!ll iu atiou, was a few mi1rntes below the :~5th parallel, Ayala returned to Montt>rey, aud reached port in the middle of St~pt..,ml1er, l Im. Beiug al'lked whetlier the plate \'isited was a good port, be replied that "it was not a port, but a cluster of ports," and that "many fleets could anchor there without seeing each other." Ayala reported his researches to the Viceroy, anrl preseutl'rl his map. As a result, great interest was awakened in Mexioco, and activity in regard to settlenients near a port having such manifest advantages. Although this exploration b~· Ayala was one of the most important by<lrogrnphie achievement;;; of the time, it was strnngely owrlooked hJ later hi1:1torians. Nav1irrete dot>s not nw11tio11 it at all iu reference to results, but merely says, ".Ayala was the commamler of the ship Felicillad (Sonora) and went \\'itll Heceta and Bodega to the north!' Som~ writers record him as commander of that expedition. Gre.enhow corrects that error and states tlutt Ayala had no conceru "'ith the northem expeditio11 of Heeeta .aJl(l Bodega, having merely accompanied tbotle explorers "a short distance from Sau Blas.'' But the last name-0 writer does not mention the useful surrny made by Ayala, which has hee11, as stated abO\'e, missed in the researches of historians generally. 'l'he first Jund expedition from the south, which reached tl1e bay of San Francisco, fltarted from Sa11 Di(·go in 176~-'70. The second was undertaken in the following yeur, and prcroeede<l from .Mo11tert>y fort be exploration of tba t bod~- of wat~r. The third expedition proceeded from Un.~ same place, aud was coud ucted by Don Juan Bautista de Ania, w lro bad made the journeys from Sonora to California. Ou the 4tll of January, 17W, Anza.bronght to 1tlonterey t.be special order awl instniction.of the YiceroJ' for a 1;1u,·ey of the bay of Sau Francisco, witll a view of selecting the best sites for two missi011s, ualllely, one for Sau Francif400, aud one at Santa .Clara. In the following l!i)I'iug thet1er· vice was lIBI'foJ bled. With the help of another o1lioor a.ud t«>me soldiers a ma1· was wade from the land side, and positions were sele~d for the Preaidio aud mit:!Sioos.

B,y 1~ontrar;v winds the ship wns driYell lmck soutl1wanl tu tl1e tbirty-M·cond parallel, and did not reach San :Francisco until the Ji\th of Au~u;;t. The 1mrties began at once to build houses, rnagHzines, forts, and cl11qwls, a11d wlirn tl1c worl· was partly accomplished the comrnarnler of the Sltll Carlos weut out i11 a boat to cxplorP the has.

A sm.all compa11,\· was at the sa.me time 8cnt under command of Dou Josef Moraga to walk arournl the bay, as8ist th1· l1oat party, and unite with it iu tbc northeast at the mouth of the river. On this occasion most of the i1oints 011 Sa11 Francisco Bay recPin·d the rnlmeH hy whidi the~· are still known~ as "8:m P:tblo Ba,v," "Point Sa.u Pablo," "Poiut 8a11 Pedro,'' &e., lrn1 011ly a frw are specially mentio11ed i11 the accou11t of the (·x1wditio11, and ir is likf.'ly that tlwy wne 11ameil hy Ayala. He was uot, as Quiroi:; was, attended by mis;,iouarie8 who would give religfo118 11a11ws to places. The land expeditiou went first to tlie sonthenst, pa;;si11g 11romal th·.' ;;llallo1,· lagoon iu \\'hid1 the ha_y of San Frnnci;;co termi1iate8. At the southern cutl tlwy fournl a riYei· aIHl cnlll·<l it "Wo de Notra, Senora de Gnallalupe." From thence goiug along the ea8tern t>hore of the lagoon mitil opposite to the harbor of Sau Frauciisco ou tLe "Goutrn Uosta," thej· saw iu tbe mouutai11;; to the east an opening or valley which they thought might prove to lw a isl1ort mute to the poi111 of rendez,·ous with tlte sea ex1>edition, the mouth of the Saerameutu l:inJr. Ju this, howeYPr, tlH·y were deceived. Losing their way, the pa.rty pai;se1l tlte mouutain:s aud came out upOJJ a marsh_y plain crossed by several rivers, or rh·er branches, and after traTeling a short distance along what seemed to be the principal stream, they crossed it and marched northeast. .llnt the plain seemed eudleRs. The~' saw no inhabitants, and the heat was iute11st>. The time for meetiug- the se~l t'Xpeditiun passe(l by, aud Moraga determiuetl to rntlll'll home. He thought tlrnt all the st1'('a111s came from the southeast, and that their source was in the great "Tulan·s'~ {lmllrush 11w.rshc.s) I~·iug in that direction. It was tl1e river Joachiu aloug the lower reach of which tlie_y warnleredtbe tlrst Europeans wbo saw its waters. Captain Mor:-tga and his company, on reaching the mission, gan~ au account of their jo11rr1ey. The boat party uuder Quiros advanced meanwbile to the nortlieru part of the hay. Tlws explm·1·1l San Pablo Ba~- aud entered tho Strait of Karquines, which (as did ahw Ayala) they rnil:ltook for t.be mouth of the river Sacramento, and callecl it El Desembogue del Hio Grande. Aft<>r it turned toward the east they found a llOrt which had not heen seen by Ayala. The same is now called Snisnn Bay. Father. Palon-, a witness of some of these events and the only historian who recordH them, does not say that the mouth of th{' Sacramento was reached on tbis occaisiou, or that a name wa11 given to it. We may suppose that the party advanced a.s fa,r a.s tlle junction of the Sacramento , and San Joachin~ or to what is now luiowu a.s Sacramento Point. .At tliis point the missionary, Father Cambon, "eouaecrated the waters,'' and the admiuist.ration of the sacrament thert1 sng.«ested the name which was afterward applied t.o the river itself.

The· 8lW<'t'8sor of Portala in the military comm:wd of California was Don Pedro Fages. \Vlll'n that otlicer retired, in 177 ±, hi;.; place was filleil by Don Femando dL· l:iYera Moncada, who, although coucerned in plans for exploration, had not rn·e,·iously ta ken an active part for settlement ancl fortlit'r 1liscover,\'. In th1· aut.umn of 177() Rivera :set ont at tlie head of 15orne troops to "regi;,;ter" the region i11 wl1ich it was rll'siraule to found another mission, and marching north from .l\fontere;y across the plains of San Bernardino, he reached the southem end of the lagoon of Sau Francisco Bav at the ri\·er Guadalupe. The :idjaceut country was rnap11ed IJy tlw party, aml a site then select'ell for the mission was settle1l in ,JammPy, 1777. On tbt\ same plain the Spanish village callPd El Pueblo de S:tu ,Joseph de Guadalupe was founded, a1Hl na111es were assigned for the ncigliboring 111ouutai11;,; a111l stream;;; of water. In the following summer Don Felipe Neve became Go,·eruor of California, aud founded the mission of Santa Clara. 1779.
The expedition of Heceta and Qua(lra in the year 1775 was considered successful, hut it lef"t some (j1trstiom1 nndPcided, and among-;;;t. th<:>m the ext<:>nt of thr Hnssi:m settlements. Hncarelli, Vi1~ern~· of ~lexico an<l tltc court at ~ladrid, consequently deci<lPd upon another ex1wdition, am] two corn~ttt>s, f,a Prirwesa a,ud La Favorita, wern selected for the purpose. After much uelay tliey sailed on the 11th of February, 1779. The command was given to Don Ignacio Arteaga, and Dou .Juau de Ia Bodega y Quadra. Iu the expedition of 1775 the last-named officer had command of a ship. Sailing northward, the expedition of 177!l reached the latitnde of Mount Saint Elias, after having made many observations along the coast between the fifty-sixth and the sixtieth parallels. Provided with Russian maps they advanced to the vicinity of Cook's Hiver, where they seem to have been bewildered. According to La Perouse, the peninsula w11s ;;npposed by them to be Kamtehatka, and an attack hy Hm;sian force:; was dreaded. Moreover, many of tlte crew were sick. So, without reaching the seventieth parallel the ve.ssl'ls turned southward and entered Sm1 Blas on the !:lOtli of Xcn·emher, 177U. An account of the voyaire was written by Maurelle. La Perouse obtained a copy of the manuscript. The origi11al is _yet in the archives at Madrid, and a cop~· approved by .Nantrrete ii,; in the library of the State Department; Washington, D. U., which contains also eopieK of stn-eral aeeount;,; of the same voyage. Arteaga arnl Bodega ag little knew of having been preceded in this voyage h,y Cook one year before a11 Cook did of the expedition previous to his own, made by Perez and lleceta. 111 1777 settlements extended as far north as the Bay of Sau Francisco. To the southward ;;everal link;; of the intended chain of establishments were not yet filled in. The coast of Santa Barhara cha111wl had been only partial]~· explored, though Father Jnnipero had Jong intended to found there three missions. Set tiers, soldiers, and missionaries eould not he immediately procnre<l, but in the year l 777 orders were given in Mexico to recrnit for that object, and a.bout mw hu111he!l perl"lons ;,;tarted for California under the direction of Dou Fernando l~ivera. Some 1lelays oeenrred, but in tlie spring of 1782 I<'ather Serra left Monterey and triweletl south a.long the coaHt to th1i mission of Si~n Gabriel. Ile there consulted with Don Felipe Neve, who ha.J arriYe<l as Governor in 1777, <UHl they tleci<led that tlte mission of Buenaventura should be at t,lw east.em tixtrernity of the channel; that of Purisima Concepcion at the western end, and Santa Barbara between the two. On tlte 26th of March they started from San Gabriel, and were traveling when the Go\'ernor wits recalletl by urgent business. Serra kept on, however, to a site ealled, (Palou says) since the first expedition in 1769, Assumpta, or Asuncion de Nuest.ra Sefiorit., where he found an Indian Yillage in latitude 3-l,O 13' N .; and by erecting some houses and a chapel he founded the mission of San Buenaventura.

Ne\·e rejoined the expedition, aud leaving i-;ome soldiers to protect the new establisl11neut, he rnarclied westwaru towards tl!e coast, attended by Father Serra. The shore was ·' regi:.;tered ,. (i. e., mapped), arnl was closely examined with reference to facilit..r for anchorage. Teu l·~ag·ues from San llueuaventrmt thej' fo11n<l a small bay, which seemed to prrnuise good ancliora~P, a111l 011 tlw shore they erected a cross and !milt a small Prl'sidio or fort. The Governor judged that tlie mission coultl not he safol.r e;.;tablisheil until tlw fort was complete. He therefore returned to Sau Diego, and Serra to Monterey. Some so1dier8 a11tl a prie:,;t were left at the station, which they named Santa Barbara. Iu the following _year Serra journeyed to San Gabriel, Sa,n Btiena,·eutura, San Luis, and otht·r statiou8, autl made a tour of inspectfon lo tbe 11ortheru mi:,;sious, near San l·'rancisco llay. In the following year, 178t, the \'!rnerallle missionary died at tl1e mission of San Carlos ile ~fontere.~-. and was buried there. With llim tlle progress of exploration a11d sPttlempnt in California seems to have ceased, but at iuternils some villages and missio111' were snbsequentl,r fonnded. It l1a<1 beeu in contemplation to form au establishment at the harbor of Trinidad (di8covered by Heeeta in l 7oii), btit that purpose was never accomplislwtl. Of the perBons enlisted in this work, :,;eyeral tliell about the same time. Don .1 nan Perez, the pilot, a personal friend of Serra <11Hl assiHtaut in his land excursionti, ended uis da.ys in 1775, soon after hi>1 return from the far north with llecet.a and Bodega. Father .Juan Cres1)i, the associate of Father Serra iu many labors a111l _ionmeys, aml author of some valuable journals, died in California in 1182; and in the same year Father Gar<~es, aftbr opening a way from the Uolnrado conutry to the westward, was killt'd by the IndiallH. Don Antonio Bncarelli, the Yicl'roy who l1ad liberally assisted t11e Fr:wciseaus, died in 1779, and 11i;; successors were not energetic.meu. 'l'he American Revolution, in whicll were iuvolve<l in the interest of the colonie8 both l~rauee and Spain as against Great Britain, interrupted the series of Spanish undertakings and tm·ned the attention of the court of .Mad.rid to the east. It was decided that there shou!ll he no otht·r expeditions started tor America until peace was restored. The scientific and commercial world for a long period <lerivecl no heuetit from the eady Spanish voyages to the 11orthwest. All records of them lwi11g retained 1Jy the court awl the Viooroy of Mexico, the pnblic knew oul_y of the departure, from time to time, of the compauim; as th1\v were sent ont.
CAPTAIN .LUIES COOK, 17it<.

After Anso11's '\'"o,vage, in 1741, Euglisll navigators had appeared at i11tervals i11 the Pacific. Wallis, Byron, and others traversed the waters along the equator and sonth of it, hut the ent.(ll .. prising Captain Cook extended na·igation to higher latitmles. In 1769 Cook was near Otaheite and New Zealand. In 1172 be again entered the South Sea, and it was easy to forecast that the British would soon reach the northwest coast nf Amerit"a, where they ha(] not hcen since the time of flir Francis Drake (in 1578).

Oaptaiu Cook bail viewed the ic.Y barrier near the Sonth Pole, but iu 177() he turned 11ortllwar1l and was commissioned to discover whether any passage for ships was practicable hetwP1~11 tht· Pacific and the Atlautic waters. Other officers were at the same time sent for the sanw oh_it>ct to Baffin's Bay. It was not supposed that any passage could be in less than 6S 1legrees of latitude, as Hearne, an English traYeler, had found the laud continnous below that. parallel. Uook ll'<ts therefore directed to winter at the Sandwich Islands, and proceed from thence in the spring of 1778 as directly as possible to the coast of New Albion, and to refit, if needful, in some harbor there. He was then to gain the sixty.fifth parallel, 4' taking care not to lose time in explori11g rivers or inlets or upon any other aceount until he should get in the before-mentioned latitude." Some diNtanee north of Cape Mendocino the coast was seen on the 7th of March, 1778, and as determined by ehronom~ter reckoning the longitude wa.s 2350 20' east.

That determination was adopted, and was applied as a check in marking on the chart all otber positions along the coast. On the 7th of .;\larch Cook was 11ear a cape which be named Cape Perpetua, and five daJ·s alter approaelH·tl auother, and called it Cape Gregory. He saw no more of the coast; as a stonn tlrcl\'e ilis n»ssel southward arnl westward. into the open sea, where an observation gave for the latitude 4:! 0 -lil' north.

The extrt:>.mity of the laud which he saw was named Cape Flattery, lwcause 110 liopetl to 1i1Hl a harbor near it, but found none. Hence Cook did not enter the Rtrait of Fuca, but recorded the geograpllical position of the ca.pe, or mwe probahly that of Flattery lfockH.

LAPEROUSE, 1786.

·Francois Galonp de la Perouse sailed from Brest on the 1st of August, 1785, with two ships, J,a Boussole and L'Astrolabe, and after touching at the Sandwich Islancls reached the nortbwest ('oast of America on the 23d of June, 1786. 'Vhen Mount Saint Elias was in view, he turue<l southward aud sailed as far as Monterey, in a direction different from that prescribed by bis iustrnctiont:, in which the special objects mentioned were the exploration of the coasts of China, .Japan, Tartary, aud Kamtchatka. But as the trade winds there did not set in earlier thmi ·February, some time was ginm for the examination of the Pacific coast. Until the 3d of August the vessels were detained by several accidents at a port which La Perouse called Bay des Prancois. He reached Nootka. on the 24th of August, and as the weather was Yery foggy, it is certain that littlf' was done for geographical definition. At the Strait of Fuca he did not see the entrance, but in the offing took soundings and found "a bank of rounded pebbles at the depth of 40 fatlioms." This is marked on his map, and in the narrative is described as being 150 feet high, 1 league wide, and of indefinite length. On the 1st of September La Perouse was off the coast a short distance southward of Cape Flattery, and surveyed from thence dovm to the forty-fifth parallel, and bad several opportunities for obser\'iug latitude and longitude. This stretch of .the coast had not been examined by Captain Oook. At Cape Blanco or Orford, the French navigator saw the rocks which stretch out to the southwest, and named them Isles Necker, and subsequently he applied the same name to two groups of South Sea islands. ln all other instances J,a Perouse adopted for his charts the Spanish names, or those given by Cook. The French vessels sailing amidst fogs arrived at Monterey on the 15th of September, and there observations were made for geographical position. I )n the 24th of that month La Perouse started on his voyage across the Pacific Ocean. A comparison between his charts and those of Vancouver (only six years later) shows that the French navigator bad no opportunity to advance knowledge in the hydrograpby of that region. Still, his observations would have been valuable, if they could have been made known to the world promptly; but the unfortunate fate of that accomplished navigator delayed the publication of results until the year 1797. Vancouver and others bad meanwhile laid open to the world the secrets of the Pacific coast; and thus it happened that eYen the few names affixed by La Perouse to localities on our northwesteru -coast were not adopted by geographers, and are now seen only in the journals of his voyage. His charts were constructed under the direction of the astronomer Dagelet, member of the Academy of France.

1785-1787.
Tbe resorts of fur-bearing animals became objects of much interest soon after the time of Captain Cook. In the higher latitudes the skin of the sea otter was worth much, but along the coast of California those animals became scarce, and the furs were less valuable. Prompted by interest, several expeditions went to the northwestern coast, and after touching at points south of it, they finally selected Nootka Sound a8 a recruiting station. But of many voyages, only such will be ~entioned as tended to improve the knowledge previously gaine(l respecting the western coast. The first fur hunting expedition was conduct;ed by Captain Hanna, of England, who sailed in 1785 from Canton to Nootka Sound. Cook had made his best barters in the lastcmentioned place; and there Hanna collected many skins ·and sold them at large prices in Oantou. In the year following be made another voyage for trade, but it added nothing in the way of geographical development. So also of the voyages in 1786 by Captains Perers, Lowrie, and Guise, from Canton and Bombay. Peters was wrecked on one of the Aleutian Islands, but the others reached their destination, procured furs, and sold them in China. Oaptains :Meares and Tipping in the year last mentioned were unfortunate. The first was H. Ex. 43--74

frozen up iu Prince \\rilliam's Sound, and lost many of bis crew. Tipping, with bis vessel, was lost, aml wais never heard of again. In 1788-'89 Meares made two sur~cessful voyageR. Iu 1785 an association of London merchants, under the uame of King George's or N ootka Sound Company, sent two ships to the North Pacific. One of the vesscls 1 the (~ueen Uharlotte, was commanded b,y Capt. George Dixon; the other, King George, was in charge of Capt.. Nathaniel .Portlock. Both of these officers bad served under the celebrated navigator, Cook, and by him we1·e regarded as able men. They reached the northwestern coast in th1:1 summer of 178G; antl there traded aud made explorations, and wintered at the Sandwich Islands. Dixon returned to the northwest, itnd named several places. As the chief result of his voyage, may he mentioned the circumuaYigatiou of the large island named after ltis ship, Queen Charlotte's. He proYetl tlwt it was separated from Vancouver's Island, as well as from Urn continent of America; and to Uie diYiding channel he gave the name Dixon's Strait. 'rhe fur-trading adYenturers sailed under differeut flags, to aYoid collision. with Euglio;l1 and East ludia companies. Some m1ed the Portuguese, aml one, Captain Berkele~', sailed from 08te11d, iu 1787, in the ship Imperial Eagle, on which he carried the Auistriau flag. 'fhis YO,Yage waf\ the firHt one made from Nootka Sound to the southward along· the coast of California. At Vancouver Ishm(l, Berkeley anchored at an inlet for trade, and marke(l it on the map with hii:! owu ua111e, hut it is now kuown as Na.tinat Sound. A boat was sent to Cape Flattery, alHl after lauding near a11 JudiaH Yillage mune1l Classet, went on southward, but previously a ;yawl hat! hepu 111:rnne1l to examine tlrn month of' a great inlet. On landing the crew wa8 attacke1l by Indians 'an1l nnu'uered, and that untoward event was commemorated by naming tl11i place De8truetfon Jsle. It is probably the same island that in 1775 was nametl hy Heceta "Isla 1le Dolores." Berkeley sailctl to the Sandwich Islands, aud from thence to China.
CAPTAIN JOHN MEARES, 1788.

The narrati\'e published at London in 1790 is accompanied hy two chmt11-011e of the North Pacific Ocean, the other of tlte northwestem coast of America. Meares mat.le several voyages from Oalcutta after the beginning of the year 1786. In 1788 be was again witli his ships, the Felice aud the Iphigenia, in King George's Sound (Nootka), and tlwni lrnill a trading-post. \Vhile so engaged he was visited Liy an Indian chief from the sout!J of' Vancouver's Island, and was iuvitetl to the settlement of tlte triLe at tlw Ba~· of Ulasaquot. On the 11th of .Juue Meares sailed in Urn Felice from Nootka, where he left llart of his compa11~· Pmployetl iu erecting buildings. Captain Dongl:us, iu the lphigeuia, was 1lirectcd to tram~ LlH\ <·oast to the uorth between Uook's Rh'er aud Nootka, while Meares weut souU1ward. At Ula~·aquot Souud, lte anchored in a harbol' which he called Port Cox; autl passiug Betke· ll'~"s or Nltlinat Sound, he had, on the 29th of June, in elear weather an inlet iu view, beariug eaRt-suutlteast with unbroken ltorizon towards the eaHt.

Meares has Port Duffin 011 hiR map in the position now occn1>ied on charts by San ,Juan, or Po.-exty Cove. In that nPighborhood JJntti11 waR attacked hy the natives, wllo wouuded some of his men, aud as soon as J1ossiLle the littl1~ party, in consequence, returned to Port gffingham. l\learns decided to return to the party whieh liad been left at King George'i,; Sound; and afk1· au absence of nearl~' two monthi;; he again anchored in Friendly (Jove, at Nootka. Soon afkr his return to Eughmd Captilin Meares published an account of his explora.tiorn; of 1790, and added what had been told to him of thl' Ameri<'an Ca1itain Gray, whom Mear~s ha(l met at Nootka in 1788. l\foares waR iuformed that Gm~- sailed in the ship w·asllington, in the year 178!1, to the Strait of Fnca, a ud there entered an extensiv-e iulaml sea. After sailing in it eastward, 110rth, and nort.hwP;;;t.ward, lie ltad come out upon the Pacific at the north of Queen Charlotte's Islan<l, thus pro,·ing that the land between Fnca Strait and the fifty.fifth degTPP of north latitude. was merel.Y a group of islands. Confused b,r these statements, l\foares dPnlared in bis pnhlislted work in 1790 that tl1e dh;covery of a northwestern pasi,;age (around the. continent of North America) wa·S a reasonable suppositiou. Captain Gray gave to VanconYex a true accomit of his \oyage, aml stated that he had seen veQ· little of De Fuca's strait. Many geographers in Europe hailed the exaggerated report of Meares, and the fables of Admiral De Foute respecting a great northern inland sea and water communication between the Pacific Ocean and Hudson's Bay were revived. Fleurien, the French author and minister of marine: Forster, the German historian of the northwest, aud others adopted as a fact. in g·eograpby ,;the great open sea discovered by the American ship Washington." Some called it sirn11ly "la mer de l'Onest," and others recalled the fabulous name." Archipelago of Saint Lazaro:" gh·eu hy De Fonte. On some maps the route of Captain Gray was laid down as running throngl1 the middle of an archipelago on a dotted line upwards of 600 miles in length. Vancouver rednce<l that fantastic sea to its proper size. But, as late as the sixth year of the French Republic, the geographer Flenrieu could not consent. to give up the" mer interieure." Like the two Buaehc:s, he continued to foster helief in the authenticity of tl1e romance of Admiral De Fonte, and he blames the map-maker, Arrowsmith, because on his map of 1794 the sea was not introduced, which, as Flenrieu declared, "would no doubt lead to much more important, discoveries, and perhaps open or at least facilitate the long-wished-for communication with the eastern ocean." A few years preceding the French revolution, l<Jnglish fur-traders went to the nort.bwest, and from France the navigator La Pe1omse passe<l into the Pacific. He was soon followed (in 1791)

by a priv-ate expedition, conducted by Marchand, and the Government of the United States

ordered that exploration Rlwuld be made in the South Sea. Spain also, which for ten years had discontinued her northwestern expeditions, renewed actiou, and in 1788 sent ont several parties. These were partl;\- contemporaneous with Vancmffer. The Spanish parties were commanded by Don Est.avan Martinez and Don Gonzalo Lopez de Haro, who sailed, in the ships La Princesa and San Carlos, on the 8th of March, bound from San Blas to the north to examine the vicinity of the Russian settlemeut:;. Au account of this expedition is given by Navarrete; and Humboldt found in Mexico a larl!'I~ manuscript relating to the voyage. The same vessels were sent north in 1789, and on the 6th of May Martinez reacbed bis destination, and seeing some foreign vessels, made known to their commanders that h~ bad com!'. to take possession of Nootka and the surrounding countr;v in the name of the King of Spain. He erected a small fort, mounted artillery, and sought communication with Macuina, the Indian chief of the region, who bad been during ten yean; well k~own to northwestern navigat-0rs. The chief remembert>d the visit. of Martinez fourteen years earlier, when he was on the coast with Perez. Macuina is styled by Humboldt the" Montezuma of the northwest." To him and his people .Martinez declared that his King was sovereign everywhere in .America, and that without his permission none could trade, navigate, or settle there. He inspected the papers of all foreign captains. Those of an .American and of a Portuguese vessel were admitted as valid, and they were allowed to trade; but the ship of an Englishman, Captain Colnet, was seized, and he was sent a prisoner to Mexico. The mission of Martinez was in fact merely political, yet it included some further exploration of the vicinity of Nootka and of the channel which separates it from Vancouver Island. .For thPport itself he adopted the name of Puerto de Santa Cruz de Nutka.
STRAIT OF FUCA, 1789.

When Martinez was at the north with Perez in 1774 he had noticed an 01Hming which he supposed t-0 be a strait, and having now the control of means its exploration was undertaken. He accordingly built at Nootka a small galley, the Gertrudio, and put it under command of Don Lopez de Haro, who Lad been with him in his preceding voyage. That officer sailed along- the southwestern shore of Vancouv-er Island, and after entering the Strait of Puca turned and examined the southeastern end of the island, but want of provisions and bad weather constrained him to return to N ootka. This enterprise of De Haro was conducted under special instructions. The result is given in t.hcjournal of the Sutil and Mexicana, and the author gives a sketch of previous expeditions for the exploration of the strait, mentioning the ship Gertrudis as commissioned by Mal'tinez ; but he does not name Haro as the commander. It is also noticed in Quirnper's manuscript journal, a copy of wl1ich, approved by Navarrete, is in the library of the State Department in ·washington City, D. <J. That journal mentions the vessel as under command of De Haro. It is believed, therefore, that M. Dufiot de Mofras is in error when he says that Don Jose Narvaez was commander of this expedition in the Gertrudis. The memory of Narvaez may have failed him, as he was at least eighty years old wlien he met De Mofras in Mexico in the year 1842. Narvaez bad been a very active officer. He accompanied Elisa in 1791, and it is therefore possible that he was with De Haro in 1789. When the British Government protested at Madrid against the treatment of Captain Colnet, the Viceroy of Mexico deprived Martinez of his command, and ordered him to return home by the end of the year 1789, but at the same time three armed vessels were sent to the· northwest under the command of Don. Francisco Elisa and Don Salvador Fidalgo, to take possession of Nootka for the King of Spain. This expedition reached its destination in March, 1790. Elisa. remained to fortify and enlarge the establishment at Noot.ka, while Fidalgo ma1le a voyage of discovery to t4e north. In the course of the year he viewed the Russian establishments as other Spaniards had done, and entered on his maps some names which have not been retained. At the close of th~ year he returned to Monterey, and from thence to San Blas.

Quimper flailed from Nootka in the balandra Ija Princesa Real on the 31st of May, awl passed aloug the southwestern shore of Vancoun'r Island, exploring on his way Cla;vaquot 8onnd.

Many years afterwards these were name(l b,r the Eu~disb Peddler Bay a.ml Becher Bay.
MALASPINA, 1791.

'l'he Italian navigator Malaspina was not~d for scientific acquirements and discornrieR. and his career was marked by misfortune. Like Captain Cook and La l'eronse, he eugag-e!l in gco~raphical explorations, of which the northwest coast of America was merely one branch. In 178!.l be sailed from Cadi.z with two well appointed vessels, La Descubierta and AtreYida, aml, after reaching the Rio de la Plata, ma.de a careful survey of the coast of South America, from tltem~e into the Pacific, anfl as far north as Mexico. :Malaspina arrived at Acapulco on tl1e :!d of Fehmary, 1791. By direction be was to proceed north, survey the coast, and seek for a passage into Hudson's Bay, as that was still regarded as an unsettled question. The well.known g'Mg-rapher '1'. N. Huacbc had in the previ~us yea1' read a memoir before the Acarlem_y of' France. in whi(·h he·attempted to proYe that the old fable of 1faldonado'i; discO\'Cl'.Y of n ;;trait at tlw 11orth '' wn~ founded on reason, nature, and probabilit;v.': Another of the namt' had belieYed in tlH' tktitiot11< uarrath·e of De Foute. It :seems likely t,Jiat some account of the statement hy Me;ue,, n·1<pt·(·ti11g a northern Archipelago, through which the American sloop Yrasbington was Hahl to haw !'ailed, had reached the court of Spain. Malaspina left Acapulco on tbe lst of May, 1791, arnl saile<l northwfml as far as tlH' lat.itnde of Mount Saiut Elias. Be saw no indication {)f Maldonndo's strait, but ha Ying iustrurnent1< and knowledge of mctlwds of observation (as stated b~· Humboldt) hl' detl·rmi11<~d longitndl· a.nrl latitude at many poillts more accuratel.v than bad ever heen previously done. 'l'lw height. of Mount Saint Elias and the beight of Mount Fairweather were approximately a,l'certai1wd allll magnetic observations were recorded. Toucbiug at Nootka on his return, 1\falaspina erected an ast.ronomical ohsern1.tor,\· awl determined the geographical position of the place. Two of his officers, Don Joseph de Eispiuosa l\Dd Don Uiriaco Cevallos, were sent in b~at8 to· surve.;) the islands and channels of tlH1t local it~·· They found that Nootka was on an islaud, and passiug around it the~· came out upon th" 1<pa by a channel since known as Hsperanza Inlet. Malaspina was not able to explore the Strait of Fuca, but from Cape M'antloci110 h<· pai;;r;ed, with the coast in 'iew, down to Cape San Lucas, frequently recording ohservatio11" for the const,ruction of his chart. No previous expedition had afforued data for definiug the Rhore line .with such accuracy. His records were deposited in the Spanish archives, aud ultimately he became the victim of court intrigues. In a dungeon he languisheAl many ~;ears, and was at la;;t released by the French. His name seemed to be forgotten in Spain, as, with the appearance of studied malice, his expedition to the Pacific was alluded to by Spanish writers as having been made by the ships Descubierta. and .Atrevida. The learned author Navarrete, in !tis history of

the northwestern coast, does not mention Malm,;pina, but sometimes refers to him as the "commandant," &c. But in time most of the works of Malaspina were pnblished, and upon the results of his obsenations (says Humboldt) am founded all the 8pani8h sea charts of America tmule since the year 1799. Previous representations are of value only as documents pertaining to the histor,v of discovery and development. The commander at. N ootka, Don Francisco Elisa, went out in the summer of the year 1791 to dear up nneertainties respecting the Strait of Fuca, some doubts ln:wiug· arisen in regard to the report gi\·en hy Qnimper who bad been there in the previous year. I,ikc some others this voyage of Elisa has bPl'Il rwglected or overlooked by most, writers. There seems to be only one source of informatiou in regard to it, namely, the journal of Galiano and Valdez, on the second page of w l1ich is giwn a short account of the undertaking, and in the narrative are mentioned special points, the cape;i and bays mentioned by Elisa, with the names which he assigned to them. He ;;ailed from Nootka in May, 1791, and until the 7th of August, was engaged in exploring the Strait of I"nca aud Rosario Strait. Advancing further than bis predecessors, be passed the entrance of Allmiralty Inlet (Bocas del Ooamafio), Deception Sound (Entraca de Flow), and sailed through what ii-; now called Rosario Strait. Ile discovered and nametl several islands, and entered Bellingham Ba~·, which he called" Seuo de Gaston." Elisa was the firi;;t European who entered the l~111f of GeorgiH, and to it he gave the name Canal de Nuestra Senora del Rosario. Advancing as far as .Frazer's Hive1· entrance and Buzzard's Inlet, he named the latter Canal de Florida Blanco, in honor of the S1rnnish minister. He went no further, but seems to have had some distant capes in \·iew. His meaus were exhausted, most of his crew were sick, and himself so ill that one of his offi<'ers, Don .Jmwph Narvaez, was in the latter part of the voyage the active commander. It was Xarvaez also who compiled the maps of the expedition, and these circumstances perhaps explain his asHertion made to De MofraR when they met in Mexico, that he had himself explored the Strait of Fnea and lfoHario Strait in 1791. But he had boasted of this as early as 1789, when he was, perhaps, then~ under tlte command of De Haro.
MARCHAND, 1791.

Etienne Marchand was captain of a French merchant ve8sel trading to the East Indies when
(i11

1788) n~turning from Bengal he met at St. Helena, with Oa1)tain Portlock, an Englishman, wbo

told him of' tlie Yery profitable for trade then commencing on the northwest coast of America. On his arriYal at MarHeilles, Marcbaud made the facts known to the house of Baux, a wealthy aud entnprisiug commercial firm, who at once fitted out the ship l;e Solide aud gave the command to ( \1ptain Marcba,nrl. A staff of eleven ·officers joined him, and preparations were made to enable the part~· to make discoveries as well as to carry ou trade. They sailed from Marseilles in December, I mo, four .Yt'arR after La Perouse, and on the, l~th of August, 17!11, arrived at Norfolk Bay, called hy tlw 8pa11ianl11 Baya, de Guadalupe, and by the Russians, Sitka Sound. Somewhat disappointed with the resnlts of commercial transactions, Marchand passed along the coast southea1,;t, and i>.xamiued points of land, ports, and bays on Queen Charlotte's Island and in its vicinit,y; but all ot' these l1ad hel'n previousl.Y visited hy La Perouse, and by some of the English navigators. After some attempts at trade Marchand went further south, intending to enter Berkeley Sound on Yancom·er lslmul, and from thence, if practicable, go as far south as Cape Meudociuo . .Marchand a11chored oft' Berkeley Sound on the 7th of September, but was prmTented from cntering by threateuing weather. While making ready on the following day, he saw a three· rn aHted vessel coming out of the port, which he concluded had taken all the furs that were pre\·iousl_y there. He noticed that the strange vessel (an American ship) took the course which he had intended to pursue towards the coast of New Albion and Cape Mcn<locino. Hence, being anxious to get the highest price for bis cargo, he sailed for China. Fleurien regards it as improbable that, Marchand saw even the entrauce of the Strait of Fuca.
VANCOUVER, 1792-'95.

In the period of fourteen years after the expedition of Oaptain James Cook no 1>arty wa.s sent from England to the Pacific Ocean. A voyage, however, was planned in 1789 for exploring

some of the southern regions, and Captain Henry Roberts, a friend of Cook, was invited to take command. Captain George Vancouver, associated with Cook in his last yo;rnge, was mged by Roberts to accept place as his second, and the ship Discover,\- was fitted out for them. · Not long before the vessel was ready for sea (April, 1790) it becauw known that tht> Euglis!J faetories a.t N ootka and the English ship of Captain Col net had been seir.e<l by the SpanianJ:-;. '.rhe ship "Discovery" was in consequence provided with an armament ; am'! the prt>par:ition of a formidable English fleet induced the ctmrt of Spain to ofter re;;titution. In ,July an officer was sent t,o Nootka "to rf'ceive back the territory which the Spaniards had seir.ed." Ueorge Yaueoll\·er was appointed for that dut,y. The attention of the British Government being thus drawn to the northwest, whe1·<· tisltcrit"s and the fur trade bad become objects of material importance to England, Vancouver was directed to make an accurate snrvey of tlte coa;;;t from the thirtietl1 parallel northwt>stward to Cook's RiveT, "to pay particular attention to the examinatiou of the supposed Strait of J<'uca. saill to he situak\l hetwef'll 480 and 4!1° uorth latitude, and to lead through au opening which the sloop \Vasl1iugto11 wa>< reported to have passed iu 1789.'' He was further directed to euter aud explore all tlw waters, rivm·R, a11d inlets of that coast only so far as they were navigahle for sea.going vessels, aud on 110 accmmt whawver to touch at auy port of the northwest coast south of the thirtieth parallel of latitude. Vancouver, though amply provided with means and illstruments, w;ts not so well proYidPll a" Uouk aml La Perouse had been with scieutific observers. Hence the task of makiug astronomical and nautical observ01tious devolvell on Vancouver personally. He had "a111ongst the officers aud young gentlemen of his quarter deck a few who, with a little instruction, wonl<l .-;0011 be euabletl to construct charts, take plans of bays and harbors, draw landscn.pes, and make faithful portraits of the headlauds, coasts, aml countries which might be discovered.'' His able officer... dese.rve to be mentioned, as their names are attached to inlets, bays, and capes to this 1la~._ 'l'hose iu the ship Discovery wel'e Zachaifa Mudge, Peter Puget, Joseph Baker, and Joseph \\'hidbey. '1'111· Chatham was commanded by Lieut. ·w. R. Broughton. and the officers associated with hiw were James Hanson and James Johnstone. Vancouver, like most of his predecet!sors, made the Sandwich falands his 1:.bief plaee or resort and his winter station. He Aailed from ~Jngland on the 1st of April, 1791, aud anfred at tlie Sandwich Jslauds on tlie 1st of March, 17!)2. On the 18th of tlie same month lie agni11 WPllt to sea, and saw the coast of New Alhion, and also Oa.pe Mendocino, and from theuee sailetl northward, as far as the 8trait of Fuea, with favorable winds. He kept the coast in view, as the weather was clear, at an average distance of about 3 leagues from land. "When the weather preve11ted our making fh~e with the shore or our hauling oft' for the night, the return of fiue weatht·r aud the daylight uniformly brought us, if uot to the identical spot we bad departed from, at lea:-;t. within a few miles of it, and never beyond the northern limits of the coast which we !lad prm'ionsly seen. This a:lforded .the most. complete opportunity of determining its various turuings a111l windings, a8 also the position of all its conspicuous poiuts, ascertaiued by meridional altitmle,.; for the latitude, and observations by the chronomet.er, which we had the good fortune to re1~ord once, and in genera.I twice, every day." He noted accurately the configuration and soundings near Uape Mendocino, and explored the sandy beach near Humboldt Bay, but <lid not enter that body of water. He also recognized and named the capes Rocky Point, Point Saint George, Cape Orford, Cape Gregory. Cape Perpetua, and Cape Foulweather, where Captain Cook bad touched the coast; likewise Cape Disappointment and Deception Bay, names given by Meares to the entrance of Heceta Inlet, now Columbia River entrance. There Vancouver was deceived as Meares had beeu. He saw breakers, and" not considering this opening worthy of more attention.'' lie passed on with pleasant weather and a favoring breeze which he was anxiom; to improve. He endeavored to ent.er Shoal water Bay but was uliabfo, and did not attempt to get a nearer \'iew of the country, being attmcted when off Gray's Harbor by a. high cape in the distance, named by him Cape Grenville. He recognized the Island of Destruction, named by Captain Berkeley, and ''approached with increasing curiosity and excitement the region where De Fuca's strait was said to be." On the"29th of Api;iJ Vancouver fell in with the American ship Columbia., commanded by

Uapt. Hobert Gray, the same officer wbo in the sloop Washington was said to ha.ve sailed through De Fuca's strait to an interior sea. With bim Vancou>er conferred and learned that Gmy had seen ~nly about 50 miles of the strait; but Gray ga,,e more important information in regard to the mouth o'f a large river which he had seen in latitude 460 10'. Vancouver kept on northward, looking for the prornoutory named by Captain Cook Cape :Flattery, but becatuie of discrepancy in the latitude he could uot identify the place with complete satisfaction. He concluded, however, that the northwestern end of the land 2 miles from Tatooche Island, which be had called Cape Classet, rnust lw the point so nametl by Cook, and therefore adopted the name on his chart. He at~eo1111tPti for the 1liscrepanc~· in latitude by supposing t)lat Cook hatl been carried by the currents fartlwr 11orth thau he was aware of, but in that conclusion Vancouver probably erred. 'fue headlaud wliieh Cook ealle1l Cape Flattery was not the same as that uamed by l\feares and Vancouver Cnpe Ula;;set, but was more probably the Flattery Rocks. A rock o;taJHliug nortl1west from the Cape, Vancouver named Rock Duncan, in compliment to an English captain from whom he received au excellent sketcl1 of the entrance of the Strait of I·'uca. 'l'l1e sketch is doubtless the same "sketch of the coast of North America from Nootka tlown to 47 tlt.,grees north latitude, including the Gulf of ,Juan de Fuca," of which mention is made by the Lords of the Admiralty in their additional iustructions to Vanconver. Dalrymple in the year 1791 publi;;hed Captain Durn;an's chart of the Strait. On the evening of the 29th of April Vancoui'er e11tered it, saile1I next da,v along tbe south shore, and gave the name New Dungeness to a low sa.udy point which rer1emhled Dungeness in the British Channel. In the course of the following day he examined and named Port Discovery without knowing that two years earlier it had been named by the Spaniards Puerto de Quadra. There he moored his vessels for repair, left a party 011 sbore iu charge of l\lr. Broughton, and then with boats went eastward to explore the unknown waters. The party urnler Ya11eouver started on the 7th of May with provisions for tive days. After rountling tile eastern t'ntrance of l:'ort Discovery they entered a broad inlet, with two branches stretching south·sonthwest and south-southeast. In the western arm a harbor was found similar to Port Di;;c<ffery; and to it was given the name Port Townsbend, in compliment to the English marquis of that titlt>. A high, steep l'liff forming the point which diYides the harbor from the broad eastern inlet was called l'vlarrowstone Point, because it seemed to be composed of a species of marrowstone. Ou tbe 9th of l\fa,r Vancouver went southward into Admiralty Sound, and saw on the western shore a small hay fringetl by large trePs. This he named Oak Cove. From a high perpendicn lar hlutf, marked by him as 1''oulweatber Bluff, he observed that the inlet separated, as at l\larrnwstone Point, into two branches. The western arm was explored as far as Hazel Point, a 11amt· which he ap11lied because of the abundance of those trees; but it has since been known as New Kolowau Point. From thence the channel sends out a short arm or bay to t.he north, and this was explored by Vancouver, but was not namt>d. He then passed iut-0 the southwestern extremity of the great canal, aud according to his obser· rntious it eucled in latitude 47° 21' north. Hoping that some communication with the east mighl he found iu Admiralty Inlet, Lieutenant Johntone was sent to e,xamine that quarter, but, ace1mli11g to his report, the arm known as Hood's Canal was overlooked. This was s11.bsequently exami11ed and traced by the exploring expedition, under Captain Wilkes. Vancouver, however, 1nrnsetl thron14h it aud named it for one of the Lorrls of the Admiralty. He resolved to explore tlw broad inlet (Admiralty Inlet) with the ship Discovery, while Mr. Broughton, in the Chatham, was examining the hilands uortheaHt of the Strait of Fuca. On the 18th of May both vessels moved accordingly, and Vancouver entered the main body of .Admiralty Inlet.. Ile found au attrar.tive region. A point of land near a good roadstead he first uamed Village Point, from an Indian village in that vicinity, but afterwards he marked it as Restorat.ion Point., lmving, aH he says, "celebrated that memorable event when at anchor under it.'' 'fhi~ point, lyiug at the northern entrance of Port 01·chard, north of a. small island now known as Blake Island, lw made the principal station while exploring the sound. From thence he sent out parties to examine the different water branches, and there he awaited the return of the party in the Chatham. Towards the south, Admiralty Jnlet shows two hranches, separated by Vashon Island. To explore the southwestern arm a i>arty was sent in boats under Lieutenant Puget, on the 19th of May. Meanwhile Vancouver and his men examined the vicinity> and ilpproaehes to

A boat expedition fonud it to lie an interiol' ha.sin witb several branches, and it was named Port Orchard. Ou Vaneotffcr's chart it is shown a;; a closed basin, but su bseqnentl;v his sketc11 was corrected when it became k11owu that tl~ ;;o-calle<l port had other branches, communications, and pasimges. On the ~5th of l\fay Mr. Broughtou returned to t!te Chatham from his nortlwru excur;;ion, arnl joining Vancouvm· oft' Port Orchard gave him fotelligence of a large as.~('!llbla~e of islarn\;; 11mt 11 .. a;;t of the Strait of Fuca: the Haro Arcbipela,go. Vaucou n;,r set out 011 the follo_wing day to explon· further south the main arm of the great channel (Admiralt~' h1let), at the s:ww time directi11g that, on the return of Puget and hii-; party, Broughton was to examine a bra11ch to tlw 11ortl1t>ast. tl1e eutrance of which hall been seen on the eastern shore. VaneouYer lia(1 noticed 011 that ,.;hon', in latitude 470 17' uorth, au opening which he supposed might lcHd far to the l'astvrnl'll, at-i a r.lllge of clistant snow-clad mountains was markt>d by a break corresponding with the <lirectiou of tlH' branch. He soon aftt>r found there ouly the cioSe\l hody of 'vater now !mown a,;; Comrnericemi>11t Bay. Proceediug· 011 the main water, anotJ1t>r land ope11ing was seeo leafling· in tl1e dirPct io11 to t lie ]Jlace at. whieh the ships WC'l'l~ moored. The land pron·d to he a large isla11d.

To the east and south all was inclosed hy land and he had ah'eady entered tlie quarter which ha<! bern assigned to jfr. Pnger. He thPrefore returned a11d reached the anchorage 011 the 2Hth of 1\iay, on his way ]lmi;;inp; th(· westt·rn si1fo of Vashon l:sland. l'uget bad pal'i:sed quite through the southwestern part of Admiralty Inlet, a1ul to that brauch Vancouver gave the 1iame of Puget, ::3oum1. Broughton had sailed to tlie branch which was aftet'wanl8 calle<l Possession t;omal, am! tl1ne the returning party found the Chat Imm a.t a11chor on the 30th of Ma,1. Mr. \Vhidbey had been prC'viousl.r s;ent in a boat to explore the northern hranclws of that sound. One was named Port Susau, but it is now known that it has a11 ope11i11g to th1· i1ortl1 · .another was named I>ort Gardner, and to a small harbor found h;y the part..r \'anconver gave tlw i1ame of Penn's Cove. The officers aml men of Vancouver's compimy being llgain co\lecte1l, :t1Hl, a;; 111> jntlge11, the exploration being complete, the comma111ler co11cluded to take formal 110s>1essi011 of tlu·. reg;io11 before proceeding to another field of rt>search. That ceremony was performed on the 4th of .1 nm·, the anniversar.r of t.he birth of King George III. Vancouver went a8hore, and with r,nstomar~ formalities claimed all the coasts from that part of New Albion in latitude :mo '.!O' nortlt to tl1e eutrance of the Strait of Fnca; also the island:s within the >;trait, tho11e in the interior st>a, and all the channels and branches of that sea.. 'l'o the»e collectively he gan~ foe name Gulf of Heorgia. 'l'he adjacent tract he called New Georgia, and the bay or inlet wlrnrl" the ceremonieH WC'l'f' per· formed was named Possession Sound. Ou the 6th of ,Juuc botb ships srtiled through the entrance of AdmiraJt..r Inlet to the 1iorth :tronurl the cape to which was then given the name Point Partridge, and, when near what is uow callell Smith's Island, Whiclbey wa;; sent with llOa.ts to explore two ent.rancPI': visible 011 t!J(· main shore towards the northeast, the vessels keeping on nortl! to a harbor seen hy Broughton when he was cruising with the Chath:tm at. the end of l\fay. He had named the place Strawherr~' Ba:.·. This port was on the southeastern side of an island, callecl by VanconYer Un1res;,; l,.;laml, where the ships were moored to await the return of Ute boats. There \\'hidbey arrfre<l 011 thC' 10th of ,June, and reported that having entered the most southern of the two inlets he found it a imrrow and intricate channel abounding in rocks aud communicating with anotlrnr pre,-iousl.v di1;co\'el'ed by him, which was supposed to be closed, aud was named Port Garduer. The name gfrPn to t.he one last visited was Deception Pa!l.sage, a111l the long strip of land which \-Vhidhe:r had prnvPrl to be an is1and was named Mter him, Whi<lbey Island.

further operations aud boat excursions. The.re Broug-bton was left in commaud, and was directed to make astronomical obsenations, while \Vhidlwy went southeast to complete the surve;y of the great hay he had discovered from Deception l'assage; and Vancouvu in person started with hoats to4'i'lrn north to examine the shore of the continent. He left Birch Bay on the 12th of June, and explorrd two bays, but assigned no name to either. Passing around a long, low peninsula, west of the:-w, he called it Point Roberts, after Capt. Henry lwberts, his predeceo;sor in the command of the 8hip Discover,)·, and sail~d along· the shore8 of' the delta of what is now kuown as Frazer's Hiver. Ilere the soundings diminished from 10 fathoms to 1 fathom, and all endeavms to approach the eastern shore were to no purpose. The sand bank was so extensi"rn that in order to clear it he was constrained to pass westward to ancbor for the night. Next day Im again started in a northeast direction and found a cape which Jrn named Point Gra;r, in compliment to Capt. (ieorgti Gray. The space between this and Point Roberh; seemed to be "a low :ti.at yery mucl1 inundated, and to have two openings lletween the two points." These were doubtless the montlts of Frazer's River. Tl.le sand bauk between them he uamed Sturgeon Bank, as he ltatl bought some sturgeon there from Indian fishermen. Th us Vancouver mis~ed the discovery of the largest river iu New Georgia, as he had previou8ly overlooked the Columbia River entrance. From l'oint Gray he sun'eyed three extensini channels, named by him Buzzard's Canal, Bowe'll Sound, arnl Jervis Canal. On his way southward Vancouver met m1 the 22d of June two Spm1ish vessels near Gray's l'oint; and iu convei'fmtion with Captains Valdez and Galiauos learned that the expedition nuder Eli8a had iu the preeecling ,year, and earlier than himself, examined tbe shores of tlw Gulf of Georgia. They exhibited Elisa's charts, and Vancouver Baw on them the shore lines of bays aud other geogmphical detail8 exteudi11g 4 leagues further than he had advanced. Tile Spauish commanders were su111rised when told that Vancouver had not seen the rfrer entrance whicL Elisa ha<l 1iame<l Itio Blanco. The English commander el· id entl.r knew nothing of the existence of I·'raztT's River. On the :!3Ll of June Vancouyer again was at the anchorage of his vessels in Birch Bay. vVhidhey had previously arrived from his boat excursion to the eastward, and re.ported that lte hall ex. amined a large expapse of water; and on his cl1art Vancouver marked it with the name Bellingham Bay. Other l.lOats had been employed in the examination of islands at the west, I.mt ''these were found so abuu<lautly dispersed as to preclude any correct examination witliout having leisure for the purpose." TLus, Jiavi11g traced 011ly the soutberu and eastern parts, the dernloprnent of the Haro Archipelago was left to later explorers. "\'\'ith a fine breeze and very pleasant weather, tlie two sliips sailed from Birch Bayou midsummer morning· aud proceeded nortliwei;twanl up the gulf. Soon after, Yancouver agaiu met tbe Spanish expedition under Valdez and Galiano, and the three co11muu1tlers resolved to carry on the work of discovery joiutly. Sometimes the exploration of' an i11let or cave wa8 confided to the Spanish, and at other times to the English officers; but the partueri;hip was soon dissolved. After the 13th of July each party pursued its own course. Y ancouver sent LiPutenant ,Johnstone in a boat to ascertain whether or not the inland waters 011 wl1ielt they 110w were had any outlet to the Pacific. .After passing through narrow straits, it was foun(l that the tide entered from the northwest; and as the party advauced many Indian canoes were met, and as generally near the mouth of an outlet the shores were i;tndded with ludian 11ettlc111e11ts he judged that be was in a passage to some other water, and soon after saw a broad shl'et of ocean iu the distance. On the chart the passage was marked Johustone Strait, On the 10th of Augmit Vancouver entered the Pacific and passed along the coast to the 52d pa1 allel, returned al'ounrl the island, and arrived at Nootka on the 27th of the same month. _Four days after be was followed hy the Spanish ships Sutil and Mexicaua, which had also explored ,Jolmstone's Strait with its numerous branches aud inlets, and had given names to all. Vancouver preteded them, and it is proper that geographical names attached by that navigator should be retained on existing charts. \Vi th Quadra, the Spanish governor, then resident at Nootka, VancouYer agreed, and the great island was named Quadra aml Vancouver Island. In October of the same year (1792) he 8ailetl for the Sand wicb Islands, which bad become, since the time of Captain Cook and the fur.traders, a harbor of resort for the northwestern navigators from England a11d Eastern America. Vancouver left N ooika with three vessels, the Discovery, the Chatham, aud the Dretlalus· .After itwaiuing a sllort time in sight of the southerJI coast of the island, he crossed the ap1iroaches

of the Strait of Fnca. Uaptail1 Cook had applierl tlie name CaJle Flatter.'· to what Va1wo11\·pr had called Cape Classet, but, on iillding that his designation was the name of an inferior ludian el1i(·r, Vancouver adopted tbe name which the cape uow bears. On the 18th of October he was off Bulfinch Harbor, so called by Ca1ltain Gra.v, who discovered it, and from theuce Mr. vVhidhey w~ts sent in the Daedalus to explore the pmt. Vancouwr in the Discovery, and Brou.ghtou in tlie Chatham, went on to the entrance of Columbia Hh·er, and there the Chatham was directed to lead in, aml signal at the bar if not more tli:m 4 fathoms of water should be found on.it. She safely made her way iu, but the Discovery iu following soou came into 3 fathoms. Vancouver considered llis vessel in danger, and hauled to tlie westward. The clay following be made two other attempts to enter aud reach the Chatham. Tl1e weather wns dear and favorable. Vancouver saw far into the valley, and obi:;erYed to the eastward a high ~now-clad mountain, which he named Mount Saint Heleus, in honor of the Ilritish :unbasimdor at Madrid. It is a peak of the great, range of mountains south of ]\fount Baker and Mount Raiuier. On the :!fat, as the weather looked threateniug, Vancouver stood out to sea, leaTing the exploration of tlw rinr entrance to bis lieuteuant, llroughtou. Un the wa.r southward the corumander agaiu determiue(l the geographical poisitiou of Cape Mendocino, and fouud the latitude to correspond exactly with liis former ohserYatiou. The longitude determination was within 3', and this proYed tlle acenrae,r of his first survey. From thence be made a quick passage to Ran Francisco Bay, whPre hi:' arrived on tbc 14th of November, and was rejoiued in the following week by Mr. Broughton, wlio hatl rctnrned in tlie Chatham after exploring the Columbia Hiver. He safely passed tlw liar of tbat rin~r a11d auchore<l abont a mile a11d a 11ual'ter iusidP of it. Seeiug tlle DiscoYery put to :,;ea again Broughton supposed he \Yas left to ('Xamine further. He had uo definite instructions, bnt w011t 011 eastward, guidecl at the outset by a sketch made hy the American, Uaptain Gra,Y. Broughton sounded in tlifferellt llirections, and gave names to se>cral poiuts and ba,ys. Young's Bay and Young's I~iyer he named after Sir George Young, of the Hoyal Navy; Gray's Ra:v ht' 1uuuctl in compliment to the Amel'ican captain, and Baker's Bay for the commander of a small vessel, the ,Jeune~·, whieli had enterl:'d the Uolurnbia lJefore the Chatham. In the <'ourse of tPn <lays Brouglltou we11t about 80 miles up the river, and gave uames to seYeral points, islands, and branclles. It is now difficult to identify the places, as the sketch published by Vancouver (plate 5 of his atlas) contains only a few of the names. .But this is not important. It suffices to state that lie went up the river nearly to the great mountain range, and onl:,v a frw leagues west from the Cascade::;, which were described to him by au Iudian. He named the place at which he turned back J>oint Vancouver. Possibly the river Mannings, of Broughtou, may be the V\7 illamette, but the latitudes do not agree closely. On the 4th of November Mr. Broughton was again 011 board the Chatham. He put to sea on the 10th, and ten days afterwards rejoined Vancouver at San .Francisco. While his vessel was at anchor at the entra11ce of Gray's Harbor, ·whidber had exami1rnd tilt> bar in boats, and fiuding a channel of 18 foet he passed ill and moored off the 11orth point of the entrance. From that place he began his exploration in boats and completed it on the 26th. 'rhe north point of entrance be named Point Brown, in honor of Captain, afterwards Admiral Browu, of the British navy. The southern was named Point Hanson, for the Iienteuant who had commauded the Daedalus in the passage from England. To a point im;ide of the bay 4 miles east of Point Brown be gave the name Point New, after tlrn master of bis vessel. :Mr. Whidhey ld't probably on the '.!7th of Oct-0ber, and rejoinetl his commander at Monterey ahout thl!> middle of November. Vancouver remained at San Francisco Bay only to make a sketch of the entrance, and some visits to the neig·boring missions. He left on the 25th of November, aud "deliuenting the coast," proceeded to Monterey, wberehe arrived on the 26th and remained unt,il the end of the year 1792, occupied in exploring the vicinity and preparing charts, drawings, reports, and letters for Englaud. He determined the longitude of his observatory, ne.ar the Presidio of Monterey, from a series of nearly two hundred sets of observations, to be 2380 251 45" east. "This resnl t" Yan con· ver remarks, "differs considerably from that of l\Ialaspina, who places l\Ionterey 35 miles farther oo the west, in 23i 0 51', and he also places the northern promontory of Cape Meudociuo ~U', and Point de los Reym; 33' farther to the westward of their positions as shown by our observations.' By Vancouver's calculations the entire coast of North America was uniformly moved about 30

"Thei;e" says VancouYer, "are authorities which demaml the ~reatest respect a11d confidence, yet from the uninterrupted serenity of 111e weather that lll'l'Vailrd at the time our observations were made: I IHH'e beeu induced to adopt tile meridian ohtained from tlie rnsult of our ow11 observations." On the 14-th of ,J au uar,r, 1793, Vaucouver left Monterey and sailed directly for the 8and wich Ishu11h;, wberP be remaiued until the end of March, and then set out on a second Yoyage.

The lastname1l islaud stretches some of its promontories far to t.lrn west an.I advances more into the oeean t.11an othl'I' i8l:rnd8 of that rPg"ion.

Yaiwoin·N entered these waters, i-iml iu this was preceded only by oue navigator, the Spanish captaiu, Coamafto, whose ohse_rvations were usefal to the English uaYigator. The Spaniard, of whose voyage further mention will be made presently, sailed from Mexico when the Sutil and JHexicana startPd, am] in the course of six months sun·eyed many parts of the archipela.gos of }{~vill::igigedo, Prim:c of \Vales Island, &c. Some of the names girnu by him were rnt<Jined hy Yallconver, which proves that he mnst. J1ave known something of Uoarnafio's results an<l was materiallr assisted by his charts, which, in the opinion of Humboldt, he probably had on board. Bnt m ueh thn grPate.st 1legree of merit regarding these explorations must be accvHled to Vanconn~r. lkn; iu 1he north, as formerly in the south, near th(' Gulf of Georgia and at the mouth of ( iolnm hia }{,j ver, Vancou vcr a ud his officers, hy advancing through the deeply indented inlets, <\llJJroached those remarkable 111on11tains that run along the northwest coast of America. A few hig·h 1m11111iits of the coast ranges and some isolated peaks were previously known, as, for example, .Monut SaillT l~lias, l\fonnt Fairweather, Mount Edgecnmbe, and others; but the interior ranges lwd uever Ileen seen hy Euro11ea11s. Vaneou>er traced them from California uortbward to Russian A111erica. 011 thl' 8tb of October Vancouver left Nootka, and in the course of a week he wa1:1 off Cape l\Jp111lnci110. LiP11te11ant l'uget was sent to gain ;nformation conceming Port Bodega, but as in the year pn·vious, i11deme11t weather made the intended survey impracticable. Vancouver meanwhile went to :San Frauci:<co, but the Spanish authorities were not co1·dial, and he kept ou to Monterey. On tile 5th of Xowmber lie sailed again to complete his examinatiou of the coast southward to the ;rnth parallel, as e11joiued hy bis instructions. He passed along to Poiut Conception and from thence through the Santa .Barbara Channel to San Diego. Favored by circumstances he everywhere approadwd tlw shorP line, entc>red little harbors, and gave nall)l:ls to several points which he found to he nam(·less 011 tbe Spanish maps, as Point 8al, Point Arguello, Point l~elipe, Point Firmin, Point Yi11c{·t1k, Point Lasneu, Point Dume, which have been ado1>te<l by geographers, and \~aucou..-er has thus conrnt<·morated many ·11ohle and hos1Jitable Spanish friends, both officers and missiouaries, Dou Sal, Don Arguello, Dou I~elipe Goyeocbea, I<'atber Francisco Dume, Father Vincente, and Fat.her Lasnen, e<tch of whom had receiYeu him cordially as he stopped at intervals iu pat'.lsi11g .alo11g the coast.

Cook, La Perouse, and Malaspina had touched the western coas~ here awl there, hut Yancouver was the fiT8t in attempting a continuous i,;mTe~'. The 1:5pauisll n>yages of tlrnt period, e~eu wheu intended to aicl in geographical development, were commonly mere snmmer excursions; but Vancouver took ample time. Hi:s explorations l'mployell three snn1mers from the date of Iii,; arrival at the northwest in April, 1 i92, until his departure in September, 17U4. ~loreoYer, many of the previous expeditions had been eo111.lncte1l by men of merdy on1inar;r acj1uirements, captai1rn of merchant vessels and fur traders, like Portlock, Dixon, Mareliaud, Gray, and otliers, who of t~om·s\' occasionally made cliscoveries in a region so little known. Yancou\'er and his companions possessed the qualities aud the means requisite for his purposes. Ile bad ueen trained under Captain Cook, aud was provided with the best instnuaeuti:; tlien known for makiug useful ubsen·atio11s. 'fhe period of his survey was probably the most active in tlrn history of western exploration. He states that in l792 there were npwards of twenty fnr-tradi11g Yessels 011 the coast, a111l f'Xcl11:sh'11 of his own three ships, the Spania.r<ls had two uudel· Valdez and G;iliano; two or three men of war under Bodega y Quadra, sent. to Nootka Sound; aud tbP snrve,\·iug ves:;;el .Arauzas, under Uaptain Caemaiio. The total of thirty vessels were eondnctml by oflicers of ahility, aud were accompauietl by astronomers. All contribute1l to make those hitbert.o obscure J'egions bettor known. No former time hatl g,tthered sm:h means antl forces for co,ist exploration. After the disclosures made b,y Cook in 178fl had directe<l atteution to the JSortheru l'acific, citizens of the United States, as also some in England, Fr<mce, and other countries, sent expeditious to that promising region to e11ga~e in the for trade; and some Americans while so employed became as prominent in the history of discovery as l\larchand, Meares, aud Dixon, of whom mention has been made. Amougst them, the Captains Keudrick, Grar, and Ingraham are best knowu~ But few of tbe American captains wrote narratives of their voyage)'I. All prohahly kept log books or journals, lmt tbese were not published, and probably have been Jost. Of Uapt. John Kendrick's papers none, so fal' as we know, have been published or eveu prcsen-ecl. The log book of Capt. Robert Gray was for some time ill possession ·of his heirs, and from tlie second Yolumfl' a few extracts were published in Bostou, but nothing is now known of the manmicript. The journal of Capt. Joseph lngraham's voyage in the ship Hope, in manuscript, is in the library of the State Depa1·tment in Washington City, D. 0.

Thes fitted out two Yessels the Columbia, aml the "'asbington, with requisites, and gave the direction of the expedition to Capt:.iin Keudl'ick, with whom, in the Columbia, Ingraham went as mate. Gray had commnrnl of the "\Y asltington, itud both were provitle<l with sea letters issued by the Federal Goverumeut, and Ute vessels sailed from llosto11 on the 30tlt of September, 1787.

Ou tile bar ltis vessel grounded, and was attacked by the natives; but lle got. off without much injury, and on the 17th of September he anin'd nt Nootka Sonn<l, the place of re1tde)'.;Yous, where he was soon followed by Captain Kendrick iu the Col nm hia. Oecupied with trawsactiom; in the fur trade, the vessels remained in harbor dnriug tlw winter of 1788-'.SU. The Columbia pas:sed the following summer there, but the Wash· ington made trivR to tlw north aml south, exploriug tlie country, and collecting furs, which Gray from time to time deposited at Xootka. In one of his trading excursions (June, 1789) he explored the 1:>astern coallt of Queen t:lrnrlotte's lslaml. The western shore had been seen by the Spaniard rerez, iu 177 4, b,r the French under La Perouse in 1786, and by the English, Captain Dixon, in li87, who had also ohservetl partiall.v aloug tl1e east side and discovered the broad strait which separates it from the continent. He called the islaud Queen Charlotte's, and the channel Dixon's Strait. 1' ot knowing the facts which ham just been stated, Captain Gray belieYed himself to be the !liseornrer of the great. island, tlJe eastern coai,;t of which he saw and followed further than either of his predecesso1·s. He touched also at mauy points along the shore, and gave it the uame of ·washington lslaml, and that designation was in use for some years among the fur traders of the G11ited States. In one of his vo;rnges from N ootka to the south, Gray eutered the strait discovered by Captain Berkeley in 1787, and by him named De Fuca Strait. Gray sailed in it about 50 miles, and understoo1l from the natives that it extended farther north, and then returned towards the Pacific. (iray aftt'rwanls related this to Vancouver, lmt he nowhere states why be did not pursue this JH'om1srng opening. Ou his return to Nootka he fonnd Captain Kendrick preparing to sail with ful's for China, but after hearing ·the account given by Gray rel'!pecting the Strait of :Fuca it was tl1~culed tltat tl1e latter should take the Columbia across to China, while Kendrick remained with tlte \Yasl1iu~to11 on the northwest coast. Gray arifred at Canton on the 6th of December, 178!!, sold his fnrs, and returning with a cargo of tmt hy way of tl1e Cairn of Good Hope, reached Boston ou the 10tl1 of August, 1790, ha\·ing carl'it'd the flag of United States around the world. What Captain Kendrick did meanwLile is not exactly known. Mr. Greenhow says that on parting with the Columbia he sailed in t11e \Va8hiugto11 tu the Strait of Fuca, and was the first navigator who passed through its eutire length into the Gulf of (icorgia. We will therefore briefly recapitulate what is known certainly in regard to Krndril'k's rnoY!)ne11ts, vo~·agfs, and fate, after his sepaiation from Gray in the autumn of 17811. We know that after tl1e separation Le engaged in speculations, one of which was the collection ofetl1e odoriferous sarnhll-wood which grows ou ruauy islands of the Pacific, and that be t-0ok the wood to China. He pure based several tracts of land near N ootka from the Indian chief Magninna, and he was again at Nootka in the swnmer of 1791. In that same summer Captain Gray returned to Vancouver Island and passed the following winter at Olyoqnot Sound. It is probable that be went once or twice to Nootka and there saw and conferred with his former commander·. At the

Ingraham bad previonsl.Y sailed with Kendrick as mate, and of ronr:-e had 8ome conversation with him, as explicitly stated in his journal. Ke11drick was killed b~' au accident at the Sandwich Islands in the yea.r 1793. So far as "e know he made no important discoveries, hut hix conutrymau, ltobert Gray, made several. The auonymom; anthor of three letters from California called "Noticias de la Pro'l"'incia de Californias" (not to b!' confounded with the notieia.s of Ve11egml) says that the viceroy Spain had sent out letters to all tlw rni8sions, directing that uotice Rhould be gh'en to the Indians of a certain .Americau-Eng·Jisbman uamed Juan Kemlrig, sailing about their coast, wlw bad coined and issued m011ey in liis owH name, and ordering them to seize bim wherever the;v could. The results of Gras's commercial operations were not large, lmt he sailed agaiu iu the ship Columbia from Boston on the 28th of September, 1790. SeYeral other vessels sailed at ahout the same time from that port and from New York, hound for the Nortl1 Pacific, and amougst them was tlie brig Hope, commanded by Joseph Ingraham, formerly mate of the Columbia. Ou .Lis second nortbwesteru Yoyage Gray arrived at Clyaquot (Yancoin-er Island) on the 5tl1 of June, 1791, as stated by Greenhow. From thence lie went to 11igher latitudes and rl'tumed iu the antumn to Clyaqnot, where he built a fort (Fort Defiance) aud passe1l the winter of J 791-'92. 111 the following spring be made a trip southward along· the coast of New Alhiou. At the outset, on the 29th of April, 17H2, he met Yancouver and con'l"'ersed witlJ him respecting the 8trait of Fuca and a certain great river (Columbia River), to wbi<!\1 allusion has already been made . .After parting with Vancouver Gray went southward. On the 7th of l\Ia;r he disconred iu latitude 46° 58' north an inlet which seemed to promise a good harbor. Ile entered au<l fouml himself in a bay "well sbelte1·ed from the sea by lL>ug sand-bars and spits.'' 'l'here be remai11ed tliree days, trading with the natives, and uamed the place Bu lfiucll Harbor, in honor of one of the owners of bis vessel. This same ha~- was aftPnvards ca Heil Gray's Harbor by Yancou Yer. On the 11th of May Gra;y was again near the entrance seen b.Y him ill 1788, wl1ieh in his log-book is styled bis " desired jJOrt," JJTObablJ because he had great expectations in regard to it. On passing the ha.r he found the eutrauce of a large rh'er of fresh water, and remaiued teu days tr~tding with Indians. According to his log book the exploration tY,en made waf.l prm;pented to a point nearly 25 miles l)~· the rin'r C<1urse. \Vheu Gras left he gave to the river the name Columbia Uiver, after hii,; ship, The eutra.nce cape he called Capes Hancock and Point Adams. Soon afterwards he made known at Nootka. Sound the discovery of Bulfinch Harbor and Colnmhia Uirnr to the Spanish commander Quadra, and snhseque11tl~· to Vaucouwr, who ordered a further exploration of the vicinity . .From Nootka Sound Gray returned, by the way of China, to tbe Cnited i:'ltates. Captain Ingraham, in the ship Hope, left Boston in Se11temher, 1790. While crossing the Pacific he touched at a group of unknown islands, au<l then went northward to Queen Ulmrlotte's. He made a second voyage to that island in 1792. The journal of his rnyages is i111porta11t, as it preserves notices of other American explorers, chiefly of Kendrick and Gray; and from the last named co1mnunicates a map of Vancouver Island an<l the coast of California. Iu 179:3 lugraham returned, by way of China, t-0 the United States.

Bronghton's voyage was from its outset YerJ· unfortuuate. He had been with V:rneounh· i11 the North J>acific, antl, as already stated, was i11 comnmml of one of the Ycssel;; (the Clrntham) of Vancouver's expc<lition. Aftn examining the Uolurubia H.iver, Broughton went overland acro8t'i Mexico by direction of Vancouver, with communications respecting transactiorni with tl1e Spanish authorities at Nootka Sound. Affairs were settled amicably by the willingness of S1mi11 to Jieltl possession to Great Britain. The surrender bad been refused during the stay of Vancoll\'Cr. .At the end of the Jear 1793 the ship PrO\·i<lence was put in charge of Brought-011. He wa;; directed to proceed to tl1e Pacific, visit Nootka, and receive possession of that port iu case tltt> restitution to Great Britain had not been previously made. He was also instructed from the Admiralty to survey the western eoast of South America between Valdivia au<l the Strait of :Magellan "upon the supposition that Captain Vai1com'er, wlio bad similar orders, would not Lan· been aule t-0 fulfil them." After many delays :Broughton sailed from England in February, l795, before the return of Vancouver, a11d arrived at Nootka (from the Sandwich Islands) 011 the 15th of March, 1796, and found the place at whkh activity bad been manifested for ;years almost deserted.

In ,January, 1803, !~resident Jefferson sent to the Congress of the.

Tl1e snggPstion was appron~d, aml he cornmissio11e1l Captai11s Meriwetlier Lewis and \Villimn Ularke to explore tlle lippPr ::\-Iissonri Rh·er and its principal lmrnehes, a11d 1.I1e11 to seek and trace to it8 tl>rmi11atiou some river, the Col nm hia, the Oregon, or any other which might offer the most direct and practicable water communication across the eo11tiuent for the purposes of commerce. Soon after the cession of Louisiana to the United States tbe travelers named set out westward from Saint l1onis, with a, partr of about forty men, on the 14th of May, 1804. 'l'hey went up the Mi8sonri to the month of Yellowstone Uh-er, and the up11er hea<lB of the last meutimw<l ,-,tn~am were explored ill 180fi.

Before leaYing the mouth of the Columbia Lewis and Clarke put Oil paper a short memo· randum of tlieir journey to the Pacific, distributed copies to the India11s, and posted a cop;y at "Fort Clatsop.

J,ysiausky, awl each vessel pursued its own courne, rnakiug different explorations iu th(-' northern par'ti-i of Hussian Asia and America iu the years 1804 and 1805. ·with the expedition went ag envoy to the Emperor of Japan, the Hussian Chamberlain Vo11 l~ezanoft". But tltat Asi::ttic power striet.ly maintained it· .,; 8,ystem of n011-intercourse with other nations, and declined the lll'oposed mission, and the envoy in consequence was taken to tbe harbor of St. Pt>ter and St. l'aul in Kamtcliatka. There some letters from St. Peterslmrg· induced him to vii;it tbe Aleutia.n falarnfo and uorthweHt coast of America.

Barauoff, the goYernor of thP Hussian Ci'itablishments, had some years earlier taken possession, had built a fort at Sitka, aud made it the ceutral station of Russo-American domiuion, which until then had htien at Kadiak. He assembled at Sitka many Russian fur-hunters and Aleutians, and the company was further ang111c11tNl by the crew of the Maria, who intended to pass the winter in port. But tlw resources of tl1e young an1l poorly }ll'O\'ided colo11y could uot SUtltai11 tlw dPpernl(·11t 11umlwr. A llisa:-;trom; fn.111i11c t·usned; siek11t>ss prevailed and threatened the estal>lishment with ruin, when, forturiatel,v, the American vessel Juno, from Bristol, R.

At length Barauofl:' ml(l Hezanofl:' purcha8ed the American Yessel, in order to bring· from California what might he i11<lisp1msable for supporting the colonr. The commarul of the Juno was gi>en tn the Rus:'lian lieutenants Uhwo8cloff and Davidoff. Hezauoff and tlte HaturaliHt, Langsdortr, went with them, and the ship left Sitka for Sau Francisco on t11e 8th of March, ISOG. 1'he passage was made tedious by sickness amongst tbe liussian sailors, all of them being sick with scurvy. ·They nevertheless tried to make some coast examinations, and attempted to cuter the mouth of Columbia lUver, where the Ru~sian plenipotentiary thought of founding rm ct>'t~tblisment.. An opeuiug 011 the coast, supposed by them to mark the eutrauce of that ri\·er, was examined with boats, lint it was soon found to be the iulct which Vancouver had named Gray's Harbor. Some <lays after (March 31) the JuI10 was at, anchor off Cape Disappointment with a \'ery sick crew. :'.'Inxt day they tried to enter, but observing that the eastern horizon was istrongly marked with surf, aucl Laving been driven by the currents towardis Ca.pe Adams, it was tleemed addsable to get away, and ta.kc a.dvantage of the fiwomble northwest wind. ThP.Y thcrtiforc sailed direct for San Fra11cisco, and entered t.bat port on the 8th of April. The transactions ot' Von Uezanoff and his officers at Sau Francisco were moistl_y com111ercial and political.

The expeuitio11 uf Lew ii; aud Ularke was noticed with deep interest hy explorers and fur-tradeni. Suurn existing companies revived and other:s were organized for prospective gains in the rece11tly opened couu try. The ~ ortbwest Company, then acti,·e and enterprising, had, while Lewis and Clarke were in motiou, ,;eut partil'S towards the l{,ock.Y l\fonntaim;, and hat1 crossd them iu 1793, when· their agent, .:Vlr. A . .i\Iackeuzic, arrived 011 the Pacific coast. Another agent, Mr. Simon Fraser, crossed the rnon11taius in 1806 at the source of the river which bears his name, and established a settlement, which wa1;'calletl }\ew Caledonia. Mr. D. \V. Harmo11 tran~led as chief agent of the Northwe:st Company durin_g- several years beyo11d the rnonntaius. Though his book (published in Lon<lon in 18~0) is simply written, it contains interesting inforrnation in regard to the country east of Vanconrnr falanrl, ancl of that around the Strait of Pnea, and also the Columbia Hiver. It is in many mattPris co1111ected witli discoveries iu that region the only ;;;ource of authentic information. The map accompany mg it is the first on which Fraser Hiver is laid down in its true course. A :Vlissolll'i fur cornpau,\· was formed in 1808 for settlements ou the Upper .Missouri, imu one of its agentH, .Mr. Henry, founded a post on one of the brancht>s of the Upper Columbia, but the po8t was soon abaudoned. In 1810 Captain Smith, from Boston, entered the Columbia a11d built a house 40 miles above the mouth, but the houise was destro~·etl withiu twelve months, as stated in Greeuhow's "Oregon and California," page '..!91.

Astor enlisted expert Cauauiau, Scotch, and American travelers auu 8ailors wl.J.o had been iu the s.,rviee of the .Northwest Company. He sent out in 1809 the ship E11tcrprize, under Captain Bbbets, to make observations at several places on the northwest coast of America; but uo detaile1l account has been given of that voyage. On the 2d of September, 1810, a seconu sea expedition, in the ship Tonqui11, was sent to the month of Columbia l{,iver by way of Cape Horn, under Capr. r. Thorne. The best account of this expedition is gh"en in "A<kentures on tlte Columbia Ri\·er, by Ross Cox." That book details event!! which occurrc>u in Oregon be.tween the years VHO all(l 1816. · Another is entitled: "Relation d'uu voyage a In. cote Nord Ouest dau les annees, 1810-1814, par Gabriel I·'rarwhere. Montreal, 1820." lfoss Cox and Franchere were, for the most part, eye witnesses of what they describe. The first uamerl came to the Columbia by sea, the other'went across the Rocky Mountains. A well·written account of the operations of the Pacific Company is given by Greenhow. A laud expedition under the chief ageut, :\fr. Hunt, set out from Saint Louis iu January, 1810, going b~· wny of the Mis~ouri River. .A 11 cx1w<litiou i11 the ship Beaver, und~r Capt. Cornelius Sowles, sailed in October, 1811. 'fhpse were all attended by men expert in their several ways as navigators, scientific observers, a11d huuteni. Ross Cox went as clerk in this expedition. While the Astorian parties were on their way the Northwest Company also advanced towards tlie Columbia by sending out (iu 1810), by way of the Peace River, a company from Canada ui.;ider the surveyor aud at'ltronomer I );wid Thompson. All these parties arrived successively on the Pacific i11 what, was then called the Oregon country. The English detachments were at the north, the Americans farther south, and especially at the mouth of the Columbia River, where, in t.lw spring of 1811, they built .Fort Astoria iu the vicinity of the cape named by Brought-On Poiut George. Thompson explored the region watered by the main bmnch of the Columbia. He followed part of the route of Lewis aud Clarke, conoboratetl and in some particulars corrected their reports, and gave au improved map of the sources of the Missouri as well as of the Columbia River. Much in1ormat.iou in regard to t.his expedition was giveu by Washington Irving in his "Astoria, 01· Anecdotes of an Enterprise beyoud the Rocky Mouutains. Philadelphia, 1836."

The voyages and travels of Franklin, Richardi::on, Parry, arnl others, m1dcrtaken by onfor of the British Government, and favored by the Hudson Ba,y Company, aided much iu g·~<>graphic<1! development near tbe Rocky Mountains. New roads were upened to the west, uut their ,·iews were chiefly directed to the north. In a peaceful way the agents of the company in time occnpie·l 11early the whole Pacific slope between California l'lml the Hns8ian Jl0"8Cf'8ions, and all tl1r conntQ· drained by the Columbia, Fraser, and 01ber rin·rs.

Their boats sailed on eYery lake and rinr, arnl tlwil' trading posts and forti:IJcatim1s were in every important location. For mar1y years scarcely one Amerieau citizrn was to be seen west of the Rocky Mountains; nay, they were obliged even to withdraw their ves8el;; from the northwestern coast." · The Hudson Bay Company had their principal residence on the Columbia, in Fort Vanco11rnr, founded in the year 1824, at a considerable di<itance from the mout.li of the river. 'l'his became the center of O})(lrations in what the.y called The Columbia Department (now Oreg;on and \Ya;;hiugton), but they established some trading post in every posit.ion of importance, from the north, ernn lwyoud tbe Russian settlements, and to the southward at San Francisco and Mont~rey.

The Hurlsou Bay Co111pany and the Hussia11 I<'ur Compans so greatly extended their i-ettle. that at oue time the two coqJorations isecrncd to divide the entire region· between themselYell. After the year 180G, when the naval expedition of Hezanofl:' and Langsdorff came down from the north to San Francisco and attempted to establish there a commercial connection with the Sp;u1ish missiouf'I, thof>lf' regions had not bee11 forgotten by the ltussians, and as they always needed pro\·isiouR they concluded to settle ~it some point on the coast not already occupied, and there ·~ultfrate ground on their owu account. :For thiR purpose they chose Bodega Bay, north of San Pr:weisco, which had not been reached by the Spanish missions. M. Barnnoff, the enterprising Russian governor, sent in the year 1812 an expedition, cousit;ting of one lrnndred Uussians and a number of Aleutians, iu a fleet of barks commanded by J\1. Kuskoff. They sailed from Sitka :-;outhwanl as far as Port Bodega. There they made a settlement, which in eonrse of time extende(l along the cmi.i4 nearl_y 40 miles, and in that stretch were a fort, Russian faI'Dl·hons08, magazines, chapels, fruit gardens, and ground under cultivation. The Spanish authorities rer1eatedly prott>Rted against tllis RusRian encrooohment, but were unable to resi8t it by force. The Russians cousequent]j· rntained possession for 11early thirty ;years. They made yearly boat expeditions from Sitka to Ho<lega Harbor, and from the11ce gradua.II;y exteniled their journeys for hunting on land arnl for taking seal along tLe coast. They went into San .Franeisuo Bay and killell the 8Ca otter in sight of the Spaniar<ls, who, if able to resist them, bad no boats. In the year 1826 the Ifossians posse.ssed themselves of the Fl\rallones, where ~bey established a litile colony of Kadiacks and held those islands so long as sea.ls and the sea.otter were to be found there.

As their baidarkas were vcr~"Rmall vessels and the Kadiacks expert fishermen, tht'y prohably, in the course of those tliirty _years, gained intimate knowledge of little inlets which had neYer beeu seen either by the Spaniards or Vancouver. It is therefore unfi:ntunate that we do 11ot k11ow what uame8 were given to them. lt is also to be regretted that 1l1pir scientific observatim1s and charts of tlie region arc lost, for it cau scarcely be doubted that such existed wheu "·e read tlte tlNH~ription given h~· a French 1raYeln of tlie cnltinlted sod!'f.\ or tah·ntf·tl officers once asseui. l1h'd on the shore.s of Port l{omauzoff. The Russo-Americau Company is said to ha\'e derfred huge gainR from thP sonthem settlemeutR; and thus the Russian Government was induced to form plans for domiuiou. Om· of the Sandwich Islands was seized, a11d in the year 1821 a ukase issued hy which the Russiau Gov· ernment was declared to be iu possesRion of the coast northward of Yauconver Iislaml, and all foTeigrteTR wne prohibited from approaching within 100 miles.

MISSIONARY TRAVELS.

The Franciscan missionaries did not extend tlieir explorations in California either along thP coast or towards the interior. Tl1ey were able to do little, as they had not in San }'rauci;;co Bay any vessel, or even a boat, at their disposal. Whe11 a shi1i arrived at the Golden Gate it wits hailed hy a speaking t.rumpet and was obliged to send a boat 011 sliore t-0 the fort. :Expeditious to the eastern side of' tlw bay were made 1m l10rl'lebuck round the bmiin, and the riven; wPre exam· ined in the same manner. This a1111ears almm;t iucredible, yet Vancouver in 17!)3, a" well Langsdorff in 1806, and otliers mention what Las just bee11 stated. From this it may be eo11dn1lNI that nothing C!'.JUld IJe 1lone at that time for the hJdrography. Laugsdorff sa,ys (in 180li) tliat Spaniards had traced the river Sacramento ueariy 90 leagues, lmt only along one of its bauks, never having been able to examine the right. bank for want of boats. Of the source of the riwr uoth· iug was known, and even the sea entrance was doubtful. But land excursions were made Jeurl_y from the principal Spanish llOSts, Monterey, San Diego, aud San Frai1cisco, to 1irocure Indians for service at the missions; and at. tbe same time efforts Wl!re made to Chr·istianize thew. 1'hese jom··

No doubt tht· history of these excursions would be interesting, but no writers sucl! as Fathers Crespi, l'alon, and De la Peua were left in California to make journals.

Adventure and Beagle, were occupied nearly ten years ( 1826-1836} with the s:urve;r of the Strait of Magellan and the adjacent southern part of the western coast of South America. In December, 1835, another expedition was ordered by the Lords of the Admiralty, to coutinne the survey of the western coast of .America north of the point where it was discontinued b.Y Fitzroy. "The impulse which .American commerce had receiveu from the revolutions in the .Spanish colonies had brought Englisl1 vessel!,; into contact with every port from Valdivia iu the sout:l.J to< lolumbia Hiver in the norUt, aml particularly the western American commerce had loug been in need of good charts." Two vessels, the Sulplrnr (British sloop of war) and the schooner Starliug, were therefore fitted out, and Uaptain Beechy, who had been on tl.u~ "·esteru cmtst, was placed in charge of the expedition. Tl1e Starling was iutrusted to tbe command of Lieutenant Kellet. Captain Beecby condnctt"d the voyage as far as Valparaiso, but heing coustrainetl to return to England as an invalid, Captain Belcher was commissioned to replace him, and after crossing the lsthmu;; of Panama, Belcher joiued the squadron on 'the Pacitic in l<'ehruary, 1837. He sailed at once by way of the Sa.mlwich !islands, and from thence reached Prince William Sound in Angnst. llis instruction;; directed that "a, general chart should be wade of California.,'' and he was a<h·iscd "to devote. some time to the bar of Columbia River, and to its channels of approach, as also to its inner auclwrages and shores." In touching the district viisitPd by Yancouver (ca1le1l the northwest coast) care was to be taken to verify the longitude at two or three of Vanconwr's principal points which differ materiall~' from the longitudes assigned Ly Sefior Q.nadra aud the Spauiard;;. From the latitude of Mount Saint Elms "the surve;y again might be punme<l to the southward aud aloug to the shores of Mexico, and Guatemala altemately chaugiug the grournJ according· to the periodic cl.Jange of weather." In accordance with theise iustructionl'.', whicb g-an liberty in regard ''to t11e i>t'lection of gTound an1l in resiwct of the diYision and disposal of liii:, time," Belcher <>xtended surveying operations twice along tbe northwest coast from Mount baiul Elias to Cape San Lucas, once in tlle summer of 18a7 and aga\n in the Rummer of 183U. A~ already stated he was iu the latitude of ]\fount Saint Elias in August. He pa;;sed some time. near the Russiau set,tlemeuts, and early in October was at N ootka, where he found an ludian pri1we named Maguilla or 1\1agninna, a descendant of the former chief of that uame. From thence be went southward, passed the Columbia Rivei· eutrance, as the weather was boisterous, aud kept on to San Francisco, where lie dropped anchor in Yerba Buena Ba.;1 on the 19th of October. San Francisco Bay hitd been explwed by himself and Ca1)tain Beecliy in the year 18'.!i, when thliy were in the ship Blossom, hut that smn\y was ended at Karquines 8trait. Ou the 24th of October Captain Belclwr started from Yt~rba Buena with the tendet Starliug, a pinnace, two cutters, and two gigs, to <ixplore the navigable channel of the Rio Sacramento. He carried tlw Starling· in as far as Suisun Ba.y, ancl with his boats iu tbe eonrse of five days a8cended t.he riYer abont 150 miles, including the 1.mrves of the channel. The limit of progress with boats lie 11a111e1l Victoria Point. 1n i·eturning lie made a trigonometrical suncy of Uw cmn·irn of the rin'r and was th mi eugaged during twl·nty <lays. On the 24th of November he agaili reacl1e<l the ship Sulphu1·, aml ten days afterw;udis arrived at Monterey. Only a few days previous to his arriYal the l;'n.mch frigate r,a Veuus bad cleared from that port. Ou the 11th of Decern her Captain Belcl1er passe1l near Guadalupe to land, and 011 the 16th rcacl.Jed Cape San Lucas, where he elosell hiis tir;;t sune.Y· ing cruise along the coast of California.

Near tht1 close of that month he entered Columhia Hiver and surv1-;vetl iti'i course aml chaunel up to Fort Vancouver. Two months were occupied in that work.

After the unfortu11ate experience of the Pacifie Fur Company, citizens-of the Uuited States for a time lost sight of the far uorthwest. A pause of some years ensued, but at length attention was directed southwest, to t,he bead of Colorado River, to New Mexico, and occasionally to the southeastern branches of Columbia Rh·er, where they were not likel.Y to come in contact with the Hudson Bay Company. It will suffice to point out the progressive steps taken in that direction.

About thi:,; time Ctlptaiu \Y yeth formed a scheme similar to tliut of :Mr. .Astor for estal1fo1hiug trade between China, Bastem Asia, and the United States by way of the Colnmhia Eiver, aml for that purpose he organized the ()(Jlumhia Fishing and Tradiug Companr. A ship was seut to Columbia Rinir, aud a part,Y was arrauged to carr;v b,Y land goods and men across the mountains. With t.he meu \Y_\eth went in (H.~rson, aud established a port at the mouth of \Villmuctte River. But it was soon auandoued, as the Hudson Bay Uomp.rny, hy peaceful 01>position, counteracted all his efforts to retain the place. His jonrnal<'l and a narratfre of his adventures han~ been published. In the ;vear 1834 the first body of American emigrants settled iu the Columbia regiou, arnl were coudueted by the Metho<list missionaries, Lee and Sheperd. Other religious associations became active. Ju 1835 the Rt>v. tjarnuel Parker made a joumey to Oregon, and was followed by Roman Catholic as well as Protestant missiouaries. Ainerican tra11pers, hunters, and fur-traders were steadil;y traveling and trading at the south; ahm in the neighborhood of the Colorado and towards California on paths opene<l and beaten br Ashley, Smith, I>attie, and Bonneville. In this waJ the attention of the Government of the Unite<! States became directed to the Pacific slope, on whi<'..h citizens had established large interests. In furtherance of them Mr. Forsyth, Secretary of State, ill 183G, llroposed the first official exploring expedition westward. In November, 1835, Presideut Vau Buren accordingl,Y directed "William A. Slacum, an officer of the United States Navy, to 1iroceed to the WPstern coast and endP.avor ''to obtaiu there all such information, political, physical, statistical, and geographical as might. pro,·e useful or interesting to the Government." The instructions and particulars of the voyage are gh'eu in Senate Doc. No. 24, second session, Twenty-fifth Congress. Mr. Slacum traveled through Mexico to Guayrnas, and left that port on the 1st of June, int.en<liug to reach the Columbia River by land. In Sonora be bought. mules and provi.sious, uut was compelled to abandon the journey, being informed by Dr. Keith, who had just then come from the north, that the laud route to Oregon was impracticable at that season of the year. Slacum returned to Guaymas, chartered the Loretano, a·vessel of 12 tons, and in her set sail, ou the 7th of July, ·f'or the Columbia River entrance. After being at sea nineteen days and making only 400 miles he was, uear Cape San Lucas, forced by furious head winds to put into Mazatlan in distress aud there abandon the schooner. An English barge, the :Falcon, was then at La Paz, in Lower California, and about to sail for the Sandwich Islands. Slacum took passage, hoping to get from thence to his intended destination.

STATES EXPLORING EXPEDITION 18:Jd-'41.

On the 18th of

Ma~·, 18:~1;,

an a<'t of Cougress authorized the Prel'ident of the TJnited States

to fit ont an expedition for exploring the South Sea, and deterruini11g the poRitimi of Pacitlc i,;lands

and ('<1nntrie8 l~·iug near the track of American vessels. Six vesi:;els were made ready, namelJ·, tlie Viuceuue8, Peacock, PorpoiRe, Relief, Sea Gull, and :FJ,vi11g Fisb, aml nuder command of Lieut. Charles ·wilkes, U.S. N., the fleet sailed from Chesapeake llay 011the18th of August, 1838. He was directPd to be at the Sandwich Islands iu tl.Je spring of the yt'llr 1840, to ::;ail from t.heuee to the 11ortl.Jwest coaflt, of America, and "make there sueb surveys and exami11ati011R, first, of the territory of tlle Unit(~d Stat.e!'I on the Aeaboard, and of the Columbia HivP~" arnl a.ftPrwardR aloug the coast of California, with 8pecial reference to the hay of San Frallcisco, as lie could accompliRh, until the mouth of Oetober following his arrival." Special attention was to be given, wlien prMticahlt>, in regar1l to the geography and 11ydrography of the various places visited. J_,ieutenant Wilkes was detained in the southern 1mrt of the Pacific Oceau a year longer than wat-1 contemplated when the instructions issued. 1.'he Sea Gull was wrecked. With tbe·Vinceunes and Porpoise lie left the Sandwich Islands on the 5th of Aprll, 1841, tbe last-named ve;;sel being in charge of I,ieut. C. Cadwallader Ringgold. The Peacock and Flsing Fisll had been sent under Ca.pt.. ·william Hudson from the Sandwicl1 Islands to explore parts of tlie Pacific, with dire<itions to join the chief of the squRdrou at the Oolumbia River by the e1Hl of .April, 1841. Wilkes arrin·1l there on the 28th of April with the intention of enteriugi but the sea on the bar wai> he:wy, and he concln1led to sail for the Strait of Puca, aud there begin surveying operations. He <'ntere1l tlie strait on t11e 1st of May, and, following tbe track of Vancouver to Port Jfo;conry, l'ort Towui>eu<l, an<l Admiralty Inlet, hastened.to the anchorage at Nisqually, where tl1e H wli>o11 Bay Company had au establi8hrnent, and there moored his ships on the 11th of May. For upwards of eight wt>eks he made that his station, and organized s11n'eyi11g parties which were sent out i11 different direetious. 'l.'o the north Ringgold was sent iu tbt> Porpoise with two boats to take up the sur.-ey of Admiralty Inlet, proceed to .Fraser Hiver, and as far as Johngtone's l11let.. Four boats were intrnsted to Lieutenant Case for the survey of Hood's Canal and Puget Rouwl. A land part;1· wa8 11ent under Lieutenant Johnson to the east, with directions to land and explore the i11terior as far as the Cascade Mountains and the middle reaches of the Columbia Uiver. Lieutenant Wilkes in person conducted a party overlaml south to the J,ower Columbia, to 8tart a i-urvey by the ere" and boats ·of .the Peacock, that vessel beiug due from her cruise at the 1,muth. A 11 the partieR moved about the middle of May, leaving Lieutenant (Ja.rr in charge of the ship station i1ear Nisqually and of operations at the observatory which bad been erected there. Tlw two land p:irlil'S recorded observations of interest, but of course none bearing on hydrography. Attention will thert'f'ore Le limited to the sl1ip expeditions. The 1rnrvey of Hood's Canal by Lieutenant Uase was satisfactor;r. The canal was not fou11d to terminate at the place supposM to be its end by J olrnstoue (Vancouver's lieutenant) in 17921 but to stretch, after a short turn to the east, 10 miles farther towards Puget Sound. Lieuten:tnt Case then imrveyed Puget Souml, and was soon joined by Oapta.in Wilkes. The joint party had seven boa.ts with efficient crews, and the survey of the numerous bra.nchea of the

sound was completed in the course of a week. Several inlets, not nanwd ou Vancouver's clta1·t were at this time named ·for officers of Urn United States Exploring Expellitiou, a,; Hudll's Inlet. El<l's Inlet, Totteu Inlet, &c. On the 17th of ,July, all the parties excepting the oue witli Hiuggold iu tlw Porpoise were again at tlle 8tation uear Nisqnall.Y; and a cornpa11y was orgauized for the survey of Gm~''" Harlior and Shoalwater Bay. r_,ieutenaut Eld was intrnsted with that work. After ltiK dt·partnre T.l1e Vi11ceuues also left Nisqually, and, l:lteeriug northward, took auotl1er station near Dnngei1ess, in the Strait of Fnca, on the 20th of July. Ringgolu, on the same clay, returned frorn l1is northern surrny. He had left ~isqually on tile 15th of May an<l commenced work in Admiralty h1let. The space the11 sounded he named Commencement Ra.~T' as it ha'l been left namelesH 011 \Taucouver's cha.rt. From thence Ringgoltl went uorth, surveying and naming mau~T points and iudelltatiorn; 011 his way. Ou the 20th he entere<l the Port Orcliard of Vancouver, and surveyed it in the (1onrse of 11iue days. It was found to communicate at. the north through a strait with nnotlier bay or branch of Admiralty Sounu (I'ort Ma(lison) wl1ich ha<l been oYerlookecl 1J.Y Yancouver in hiH Hl1ort Yisit to that vicinity. l~inggold then ente~ed what had been called hy VancomTer PosseRsion Sound, an<l snrn·ye(1 Port. Gardner, Penn's Cove, &c. On the 18th of June be was at Deception Passage, whid1 Yancou ver judged to be insufficient for the passage of ordinary '~essels. Early in Jul.Y all the bayR and islands north ward of Deception Passage were snrveye<l as far a,i;; Fraser River, and from tbat entrance Ringgold returned and joined tlie Vincennes at N<~w Un11gP· ness on the 20th of ,July, after laborious operations which occupied liis party two monthH. It. was the inte11tiou of Ca1ltain Wilkes to sur\"ey minutely the Gulf of Georgfa. Accon1iHgly, as soou as practicable, he sent the Porpoise, under charge of Ringgold, to Fraser Hi\'er with <lirectious to sail from thence through Johnstone's Strait around Vancouver Island, while V\Tilkes liimself should explore the Haro Canal. Both parties started on the 25th of July. But thest\ 01~erations were interrupted by the loss of the Peacock on the bar of Colmnbia Hiver. It. hecmne necessary to proceed to that place without delay. Captain Ringgold was recalled from Fraser River to New Dnngeness and Wilkes hastened with his boats, having completed all that "was essential for the navigation of Canal De Haro." Both vessels took courses westward, surveying on the way two sma.11 harbors, San .Titan, on the south side of Vancott\Ter Island, and Neeah, near Cape Flattery. They arrived at. the montli of the Uolmnbia on the 7th of August, where au Euglish vesi;el was purcliased to recefre t11e crew of tlie wrecked shiJl Peacock. The craft was named tlie Oregon, and needful arrangements were made for continuing the objects of tbe expedition. Under !Unggolrl tlrn Yincennes was sent to survey San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento River. A large land party in charge of Lieutenant Emmons was sent to tra\'el from the Columbia along the Willamette; to examine also the Sacramento and San Francisco Bay; and "Wilkes. witli the Porpoise, the Flying Fish, and the boats saved from the wreck of the Peacock, commenced the survey of the Columbia on the 9th of August. Mr. Eld and his party had left Nisqnally on the 19th of July, and travtlling througli the interior passed several lak('S a.nd rivers, mostly branches of the Chikee1es, a tributary of Gray's Harbor, where they arrived early-in August. The survey of that vicinit,y, hy means of hoats a.ml the canoes of neigh boring Indians, was completed in tbe course of three weeks. Lieutenant Eld subsequently tmced the coast sonthwaru to Cape Disappointment, and passing Shoalwater Bay in a canoe reached :Baker's Bay on the last day of August. His pe1formance of dut~T is specially commended in the report of Captain Wilkes. The commander himself was employed 011 the, Columbia during Angm1t, September, and part of October, and the survey was carried to tbe vicinity of the cataracts. On the 10th of October, when t.11e operations were ftnisliecl, Wilkl:'s crossed the bar of the Columbia aud sailed in the Porpoise to San Francisco. The F\J·iug Fish waR at the , same time ordered to examine the lower part o{Umpquah River, but the attempt to enter wai; not successful. On the 19th of October the Porpoise reached Saucelito Harbor in San Francisco Bay, and there the Vincennes was found at anchor. Ringgold had arrived on the 14th of August and surveyed the Sacramento as far up as Feather River. He had also examined Sau Pablo Bay and the mouth of the San JoaquiD.

Capt.·Tolm CharlP:-1 Fremont's first expedition to the "\\rest, in the year 1842, was Jimite<l to frontit~rs of Missouri and tlte Sou Hi Pm·is of the Rocky Mom1tains, along tl1e conrses of the Kaw~as a!Hl (;.reat Platte Rinws. 8uhseqne11tlJ' he recorllell olrnenations for latitude mid lougitnde from the east across to the foot of tlie mountains. His western limit was tlie high peak whid1 bears his 11ame on ma11s published since t11at jonrne:y. In the spring of 1843 Fremont again went westward, with instructions from the Bnreau of Topographical E11gineer~ " to connect his reconnaissauce of 184~ with the surveJ'S of Commander \Y ilk es 011 tL1.: coast of the Pacific Ocean, so as to gfre a connected survey through the interior of tl1e North Americau continent." Mr. Frernollt was accompauietl on this expedition by an able engineer and draughtsman, Mr. ( 1ltarles l'n·nss, and p1·0Yided with good ini,;tnnneut8 for detnmining geographical position, time, tP111peraturt::, &c. His course was at the outiset directed toward Oregon. 111 August, 1843, Im reacht'!l tlw heads of the 1mntb brauch of Oolu111bia H,iver, and passed dowu to Fort VaneouYer, wlu·rc he arrin·d in Novmnber, aud in :wcordance with instructions his reconnaissance was thl·re connected with the snrve~·s of Captain 'Yilkes. Fremont was 11rcvented by the raiuy sea1-i(llt from going· quite to tl1e Pacific; so, returning to the Dalles of tbe Columbia, he passed from tl1ence i;outbwanl iuto the couutrJ alo11g the Cascade range of mountains and the Sierra Nevada. Croi;siug- tlw head of the Klamatli tlle party at the close of the year were near the mountains, and cir· cu111stm1c1.·s constrained him to attempt to cross them in miclwir1ter. Under many difficulties and da11geT8 tl1e party in the beginning of February reached the snowy peaks, "and saw from thenee ht·low them, dinuned by the distance, a large snowless valley, bounded on tlle western side, at the (lista11ce of ahout 100 miles, hy a low raugc of mountains, which were recognized as those horderi11g the coaist." lktwet>11 tliem and the low coast range was the valley of the Sacramento. Soon aft.er water waH seen flowing towards the Pacific, and " a shining line of water was discovered directing it8 cmU8e towards another broader and larger sheet," which were "the Sacramento and the Bay of San Frauciseo," In the spring of the year 1844 the party traveled from the Lower Sacrameuto, along the Wl:'stern slope of the Sierra Nevada, through the valley of the San Joaquin. Fremont ietnrJted in a 11ortheastern direction to the Rocky Mountains, and so again reached the banks of the Mississippi. His obsenations on that part of his route-" from the heads of the Sacramt'IJ to to the headis of the San Joaquin, and the valley which !~ollects all tbe waters of San Francisco B:iJ, proved that there wm~ no such river as the fabulous Buenaventure, which had been said to come down from tl1e base of the Rocky Mountains and to open a communication with Sau Franci8co Bay, far to the interior."

On his third expedition, in 1845 and 184U, l<'rcrnout tra>ersed the central parts of the gfi·at i11teriur basin, passed the Siena Nevada at tbe '8outbern end of the rauge, cr.ossed tbe San .Joaquin Valley, went to the south end of San I 'ra11cit1,co Bay, and pal'\l:!e\l up t11e "\·alley of tlw Sa<~ra mento to the lieads of that river a1H1 to tl1e sour<:f·s of tlie Klamath.

As the route wa,; through unexplored fl:'gious~ it wi1..- Fmggested that some of the officers "should lie employed in collecting data which woul<l gin· the Governme11t im idea of tl1e region trayersed." For this pur11ose a party- of topographical engi11eers went under the command of Lieutt.:nant, a,t'terwards )fi~jor, Emor,y, with orders to perform wilitary service, in case of necessity, m1tler Colonel Kearny. The party was furnished with t'1o c\nunometers, two Gam bey i,;exhmts, aml otlier instruments, with ·which astronomical observations were made between Saint Louis, on the Mississippi, aud Sau Diego, in California. J,c\vis and ClarkP, in the year 1806, were the first Ari:wricans wbo c:irried astronom ieal instrnnwuts 11crvss the Rock;r Mountaius aud cou11ectetl that part of the western coast wllich lies 11t·ar the month of tlle Columbia witb the l\fo;sissippi regiou b_y a chaiu of obsernttions. And, as JH'eYiousl;y stated, iu the 51.'ar 181:> Mr. 'Ihom11son, astronomer and suneJor of tbe Hudso11 Bay ()ompau:r, connected the northern part!:; of' ';he Columbia with the i·egion around Hllllson's lfa,y. fu t.lie course of near]~· three hundred :rears it ltnd been cro8Sl:'d by ()oronado and h:r the early missionaries; but Emor.r marked the fin;t well-defined line t.brough those regions and deYelope.d the ph_ysical features of a countr;r uutil then but little knmrn. He adopted tlle meridian of Fort Leavenworth as deterrnilwd by Mr. Nicollet 1 and to it referred all ltis subsequeut deter111i1wtions for longitude. At the eud of J uue, 184.6, Ma;jor Emory started from J_,easenworth, carried on a nearly uninterrupted series of observations for latitude and longit\l(fo,aud 011 his route flxe<l the positious of one buudred and tweuty places, all of them determined b~' repeated observations, and t101ne, when a longer star iu camp permitted, by 8erie8 of combined observations. At Sau Diego, where he arrived iu December, 1846, llis longitude determinations were comparetl with those of Sir Edward Belcher, and were found nearly aecordant. All the geographical vositions ascertaiued by Ma;jor Emory werc laid (\own on a map which was pubfai1ietl in t1ie year 1847. That officer also recorded a series of harometrfr.al ()\\i>ervatious, and these a\'\iiled for an approximate prnfile of tlle grouml surfaoo along the route. The altitudes of the "divides'' autl passes near the sontbern section east of San Diego were found t-0 be about 3,000 foet.

In view of the great change in outline and size of the ocean, which an asimmed reduction in depth of 100 fathoms would produce, it becomes a matter of interest to inquire into the changes which would attend the alteration of the level of the land to the same extent. Assuming then the ocean to rise 600 feet {equal to 100 fathoms), we would find Nova Scotia not only separated from the continent but broken up into a number uf small islands. The height of 600 feet will carry us up the Saint Lawrence to the Falls of Saint Mary's, between Lake Superior and Li1ke Huron, taking 602 feet as the elevation of Lake Superior and 581 as that of Lakes Huron and Michigan. The waters of the Saint Lawrence would be uuited with those of the Iludson b.r two channels, by the Lake Champlain and Mohawk Valleys, which rise to the moderate height,os of 152 and 430 feet, respectively, Lake Ontario being at 247 feet. But the Great Lakes would also communicate directly with the Mississippi system, the ''divides" in the vicinity of Chicago being only 7 and 9 feet above the surface of Lake 1\lichigan, which is given by the "Lake Surny" at 581 feet above the sea. Thus there would be two large islands cut off from the continent; one farrowed by the Conuecticut, flanked on the east side by the \Vhite Mountains, and on the west side by the Blue Mountains. Th~ other island, much smaller in extent, would have the Adirondacks as its backbone. The continent itself would be divided into an eastern and western part, the one characterized by the pl'eseuce of the Alleghanies and the other one by the Rocky Mountains.

DESCRIPTION OF A MODEL 01'' THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA IN THE BAY OF NORTH AMERICA AND GULF OF MEXICO.
By J. E. HILGARD. Superintendent.

The systematic deep-sea explorations which were commenced in the Gulf of Mexico in 18T~. and which in subsequent years were extended over the entire Gulf Stream region, were brought to a successful issue in tbe early part of 1883 by the examination of the western part of the Atlantic, limited by the Newfoundland Banks on the north and Windward Islands on the south, and for which I have proposed the name "Bay of North America." This part of the oeean, as the l10me of the Gulf Stream, has for a long time back attraeted more than its proportionate snare of scientific interest; and its proximity to the coast of the United States also appeared to demand :t more special -examination than was accorded to it by the Challenger expedition. In order to obtain a comprehensive view of these explorations, which should show the prominent results in a conspicuous manner, Messrs. A. and H. Lindenkohl, at my request, constructed an excellent relief model including the Gulf of Mexico, the Bay of North America, part of the Caribbean Sea and West India Islands, and part of the adja.cent continent, as far north as the Great Lakes, and west to the plateau of Mexico and nearly to the base of the Rocky Mountains. In view of the great attention and favorable comment whieh this model elicited wherever it was exhibited, notably at the London International Fisheries Exposition and at the Philadelphia meeting of the American Assoeiation for the Advancement of Science, a short description of it will be of interest. The horizontal scale is 1-2400000 and the vertical 1,00() fathoms (or 6,000 feet) to 1 inch (1-72000), making the ratio of scales 3: 100; the size is about 5 by 4 feet. (In the illustratiou which accompanies this article the shading of the "dry land" has been reproduced after a photo graph, whilst the bottom of the ocean bas been represented in vertical illumination, benause the stereoscopic eff'oot, wbfoh is the advantage of oblique illumination, would be lost iu the vast proportions of the ocean, and the elimination of the connection between steepness of slope and intensity of shade to which our eye has become accustomed through usage, would seriously mislead.) It has been stated in the article on "The Basin of the Gulf of Mexico" (Am. Jour. Sci., Vol. XXX, April, 1881) that the banks to the depth of 100 fathoms cover more than one-third of the surface (0.35) of the Gulf. On the Atlantic coast, the bank which starts in the Strait of Florida follows the entire coast line to the eastern extremity of Newfoundland. After leaving the Strait, it gradually expands until it attains a width of 75 miles oft' the coast of Georgia; at Cape Hatteras it i11 only 20 miles wide~ but farther north it widens to 60 and 70 miles. After taking in the· George's Shoal and Sable Island and suft'ering two interruptions by the passages to tlie Gulf of Maine and Gulf of Sa.int Lawrence, it reaches its greatest development in the Banks of .Newfoundland, 260 miles out from Oape Race. Of that part of the Bay of North America which is represented upon the model, about the one-sevel!th pa.rt is less than 100 fathoms deep. This line of 100 fathoms comprises theextem~ive area of level surfaces which generally extend for long distances beyond the ooast line inland, a.nd a.re relieved by the great slopes by whicll the ooean desoend.8 t;o tile vast regions of its immense depth. Tbeee slopes constitute one of the mo11t

striking features of the model; they have, anfl not inaptly, been called continental slopes, and the isol>athic line of 100 fathoms the "continental out.line." In the Gulf of Mexico this slope goes down to a depth of about 1,500 fathoms, leaving nearly one-third of its area of a greater depth than 1,500 fathoms; in the Bay of North America, however, the slope goes down full~· to the depth of 2,500 fathoms, leaving more than half the area represented at a greater depth. The mean depth of the Gulf of Mexico is 860 fathoms ; excluding the banks, 1,280. For the Bay of North America 1,970 and 2,320 represent the corresponding figures. The greatest recorded depth in the Gulf of Mexico is 2,119 fathoms; in the Atlantic Ocean it is 4,561 fathoms, and is found a.bout 70 miles to the northward of Port.o Rico, and not very far from where the Challenger obtained its greatest depth of 3,875 fathoms. Aside from this great depth, which is quite abnormal, the greatest depth of the Northwest Atlantic varies from 3,000 to 3,100 fathoms. One of the peculiar features of submarine structure which has found expression in the model is the great steepness of slopes in the coral regions. The rise of the isolated Bermudas from a depth of 2,000 fathoms was already known from the Challenger soundings, but the discovery of the great depths of 2,700 to 2,900 fat,homs along the Bahama. Islands at distances of from 10 to 30 miles from, aml consequently mostly within sight of, the outside islands was a surprise to the surveyor and cartographer alike. It also appear~ from the model that the Peninsula of Florida, the islands of Cuba, and the Bahama Banks are located within one great coral plateau which reaches nearly up to Cape Hatteras, and that they a.re separated by channels of relatively insignificant depths. In the celebrated Florida Strait or Gulf Stream channel we find a least depth of cross section of 439 fathoms, and a depth ranging from 465 to 265 fathoms, with hard, clean, coral bottom (the least depth about opposite Savannah) is maintained by the Gulf Stream to within 90 miles from Cape Hatteras, whence it rapidly increases to 2,000 fathoms. The old Bahama channel, which separates Cuba fi:om the Bahamas, has 289 fathoms. The Provi(lence channel, betweeen the Great aud Little Bahama Banks, has not yet been thoroughly sounded, but a depth of about 350 fathoms appears probable. It is not proposed to give a description of the continental }lortion of the model, but a few inferential statements will be made. The first impression obtained by even a casual comparison of the "land" and "water" portions of the model is the contrast afforded by the great diversity of shapes in the ele\ratious (we may call it articulation) compared with the uniformity in the oceanic depressions. This contrast, however, is no matter of surprise when we consider the great part which that most important geological factor, erosion, bas played in shaping the features of the continent. Almost the entire ~fississippi Basin hal' been shaped by erosion. To this there is no analogous action under the surface of the sea, and there are ouly two or three instances where it would seem that we are able to trace the effect of erosion in the ocean. One is in the submerged valley of the Hudson River, off the entrance to New York Bay, the geology of which is discussed in Appell· dix No. 13 of this report; another one may be in a similar valley off Delaware Bay, just outside of Cape Henlopen, where a narrow channel of 25 fathoms depth in 9 fathoms of water terminates in a bar 14 fathoms deep 13 miles from the cape. The third instance is on the coast of Maine, where the effect of glacial erosion is believed to extend to depths of about 50 fathoms. Another remarkable feature brought out by the model is the relative insignificance of terrestrial elevations contrasted with oceanic depressions. An elevation of 600 feet, equivalent t.o 100 fathoms, takes in the Atlantic plain, the Mississippi Valley, and the Texan plain, and reduces the continental area represented by about two-fifths (0.40). Ta.king another step of 600 feet (or 11200 from the sea level), the area will be reduced by nearly the same amount (0.36), and leave about one-fourth (0.24) of the entire area with a height above 1,200 feet. This area comprises the Appalachian system, the highest parts t>f tlie table lands in Western Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana., and Michigan; also the copper region of Lake Superior, the western parts of Texas, the Iudia.n Terri· tory, and Kansas. The mean elevation of that part of the continent represented in relief is about 720 feet. The mean depth of the Gulf of Mexico is therefore about seven times as great and that of the Bay of North America about sixteen times a.s great as this mean elevation. It is, however, proper to state that this mean elevation is very far below the mean .height of the United States, which is. computed
