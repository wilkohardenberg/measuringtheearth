REPORT.
COAST SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., December 15, 1861. Sm: In accordance with law and the regulations of the Treasury Department, I have the honor to present my report, showing th A progress of the Coast Survey of the United States during the surveying year, from November 1, 1860, to November 1, 1861. At the first date mentioned the field parties had been arranged, under their respective heads, for duty on the coast of the lower sections of the Atlantic seaboard and tho shores of the Gulf of Mexico ; and though the temper of the public mind was then stirred, there was nothing on which to reckon hazard in sending the partiet1 and vessels to continue work on the parts of the coast on which they had been respectively engaged. This being so, most of the parties intended for triangulation and topography were sent out, and all were well received. In the midst of events which hurried the national crisis in April last, most of the parties so engaged performed each au average amount of work for the season, and returned with the vessels, instruments, and equipage which had been used in the field. This was in accordance with my instructions, in connexion with which such means as were available bad been provided to facilitate the return of the parties when further progress was impracticable. In two instances only were vessels seized and held, as will be again alluded to, with the attendant circumstances. In several others, instruments, which had been either stored with responsible persons at the close of the previous working season, or had been in actual use during the early part of this year, were forcibly taken by lawless persons in arms, and acting under assumed authority. These will also be mentioned again, in connexion with notices of the work done in tho localities in which the seizures wore made. As the spring advanced, preparations were made for resuming the unfinished work in the northern sections of the Atlantic coast, and a much larger amount than usual has heen performed, by the assignment to duty there of the force which, under other national aspects, would have been employed in the vicinity of Chesapeake bay. If the events which at one period of the present year, arising out of attempts to disturb the stability of the government, left me room for any gratification, it would be expressed while stating that the field-work of the Coast Survey has not in amount materially fallen behind that of the previous years, considering the circumstances affecting progress in the past as well as now. In the office the aggregate of work done, arising in part out of the exigencies of the military and naval departments of the public service, and enhanced directly hy the largelyincreased demand for copies of maps and charts, has been much greater than usual. The activity of the office is still maintained, and the early connexion of field parties with the military and naval operations now in progress has given ample scope for constant employment. Following the course pursued in making up my previous annual reports, a short summary of the general progress made will first be given, followed in order by a summary of that for the year which has just ended.

REPORT OF THE

SUPERINTE~DEN"f

OF

GENERAL STATEMENT OF PROGRESS.

The general progress sketch (No. 28) which accompanies this report gives at one view a clear idea of the present condition of the survey of the coast. Reference to it will show that the triangulation is continuous from the northeastern boundary of the United States, at the St. Croix river, (Passamaquoddy bay,) along the coast, and including the bays, of twelve of the seaboard States, to the boundary line between North and South Carolina. An unsurveyed interval of less than sixty miles occurs between Little river and Winyah bay, and from thence southward the triangulation is again continuous along the coast of South Carolina, Georgia, and on the eastern coast of Florida, including the bays, harbors, and sounds, to Matanzas inlet, below St. Augustine. I\ orth and south of Cape Canaveral a stretch of about a hundred and sixty miles remaius to be surveyed. The triangulation includes Indian River inlet and the course of the river northward as far as t.he Narrows. From Cape Florida it p.asses by a connected chain to the :Marquesas, and, in a preliminary way, to the Tortugas, embracing the entire 1ine of the Florida keys, and along the Main, with only a small interval, to Cape Sable. Charlotte harh0r has been triangulated, and the western coast of the Florida peninsula, from Tampa to Cedar keys, including St. Joseph's bay and Clearwater harbor. From Ocilla river he triangulation is again continuous over St. Mark's harbor, quite through St. George's sound; in preliminary form, through St. Joseph's bay, (north,) and over St. Andrew's bay. It include" Pensacola harbor and its dependencies, the Perdido entrance, Mobile bay and its approaches, and thence on west.ward, embraces Mississippi sound and Lake Borgne, and Lake Poutdrnrtrain, as far as New Orleans. A branch of triangulation, connected with this, pro· cePdR ~outhwarcL through Isle au Breton sound, to the mouths of the Mississippi river. West of the delta it embraces Caillou bay and Atchafalaya and Cote Blanche bay8, and the coast of Texqs, with Galveston and Matagorda bays, Espiritu Santo, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, and Aransas bays and their dependencies, or, in a continued line, from the High islands to the head of the Laguna ~fadre. The same sketch (No. 28) shows the progress in coast topography and hydrography relative to the triangulation. It will be seen that the largest intervals on the Atlantic side are on the coast of Maine and coast of Florida, with smaller gaps along the coast of several of the intermediate States. Ou the Gulf coast the topography is well up with the triangulation, but the hydrography not so far advanced. The surveys on the Wes tern coast, though more detached, are not the less important, all the harbors, anchorages, and headlands being included, as may be seen by reference to the sketch already mentioned. In addition to other means employed for the determination of longitude, mention of which has been made from time to time in my annual reports, we have now added the prospect of the use of the telegraph line to the Pacific coast. Permission having been obtained for the object desired, arrangements are now making for employing the method which has been long i11 u;;e iu the survey, in fixing the longitude of a point on the Western coast.
DIVISIONS OF THE REPORT.

I. The introduction to the report gives, besides a general summary of progress and a synopsis of the progress made during the year, special remarks on subjects connected with the operations of the survey in field and office work. II. The second division of the report contains detailed descriptions of the work done in each locality, arranged in geographical order, the whole being subdivided into sections, of which six embrace the coast of the United States on the At1antic, three that on the Gulf of Mexico, and two the coast of the United States on the Pacific. A summary of the progress

An abstract of the contents and an alphabetical index also accompany the report.
PROGRESS DURING THE SURVEYING YEAR 1860-'Gl.

The course of public events, while it has in some sections of the coast interrupted the plan laid out for completing their survey, has not, upon the whole, materially lessened the amount of work done during the present as compared with pre-,ious surveying years. Work which might have been somewhat longer deferred, without detriment to general interests, has fully replaced the ground tliat could not he occupied, and, as a result, the following abstract and the detailed report will show that the efficiency of the survey lias not been at all impaired, either in comparative progress or in its adaptation to the peculiar circumstances of the government. In Appendix No. 1 the localities in which the parties have worked are stated in geographical order, and the progress sketches, showing the localities, are arranged in like manner, and combined with such local charts and sketches as it has been deemed expedient to issue with this report. For ease in reference, the numbers of the progress sketches are stated under the heads of sectious in the general st.atement of tl1e progress of the year which will now be given :

MAP.3 AND CHARTS.

In the divisions of the Coast Survey office immediately concerned in the preparation and ifoitribution of maps and charts more tban the usual force has been employed, to meet the increased demand for information in regard to the coast and barbor8 of tho United States. This has not been limited merely to points which have recently become the sites of actual warfare. The inquiry has been general, and has been promptly met as to the exigencies of the military and naval departments and defensive purposes of the seaboard States, but not with reference to the numerous calls arising from the intere8t felt by intelligent men ::.t large for precise geographical information. Aside from its questionable expediency in a time like this, such a course presents difficulties in discriminating in all cases those to whom the annual reports and maps and charts might with propriety be distributed as heretofore. No pains have been spared in securing this result within limits qf entire safety to national interests, the cases of applicants who were not well known having been referred to the representative of the congressional district from which the application had been mailed. In order to meet the call for charts from the Naval Observatory to supply national vessels, two lithographic presses have been set up in the Coast Survey office, and an aggregate of more than two thousand copies of maps and charts printed from them. The entire number of separate charts and sketches now completed, including, as Y.rell as those that are engraved, the lithographs referred to, is three hundred and twenty-eight, exclusive of seventeen plates of progress sketches. Seventy-nine sheets have been worked on in the Drawing Division witliin the past year. Of this number, three are finished charts, twenty-one finished maps and charts, nineteen are

sketcl1e81 and twenty maps and sketches drnwn for lithographic transfor. Fifty-eight sheets have been completed, and twenty-one are in progress. Of thmie completed, seven arc finished mapR, and the ot]1ers prelimimtry charts and sketches. In the Engraving Division nine first class maps and new editions of two have been completed during the ymLr, and twenty are in progress. Eight plates of second class charts and sketches and six diagrams have been engraved, and six are still in progress, and various additions and corrections to five plates previously issued liave been engraved. This gives a total of twenty-three completed and twenty-six in progress, or of forty-nine engraved or engraving within the year. Twenty separate maps and sketches have been made and printed by the lithographic process at the office. The following list contains the titles of charts and sketches which accompany this report. They are arranged geographically, and for convenience are numbered, the progress sketches and some of the charts being referred to under the several sections in the body of the report by corresponding numbers :

ESTIMATES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1862-'o:l.

The estimates for the next fiscal year are but Ii ttlo more than one-half of tho~<.' of tho present year. Tlrny will e1ml1le us to continue the regular work of the surYey wl1erever our parties can move freely, to continue the working up of the information in regard to the coaRt already collected, and important to the government and itt; oJticers, civil, riaYal, and military, to collect new information indispensable to the movements of our fleets, and to prel'erve the essential organization of the survey, 1vhich has shown it.Relf RO varionsly u><efnf hot Ii in the past and present. During the past year I have kept steadily in view the directions approved hy tho department, as far as circumstances permitted, and have been generally successful in their exec-ution, as my detailed report will show. I was aware that, under auy circumstances, the information to be gathered must be of great value, and, with a proper flexibility in the conduct of the field and office work, might be immediately available to the country. These details belong to my annual report. The survey was, as usual, in progress in every seaboard State and Territory of the United States, either in work in the field, or afloat, or in the office, pressing forward to completion according to a determined plan, which would have finished it on the Atlantic aIJd Gulf coast in some eight years. In K ovemher, the exigencies of the treasury prevented the regular supply of funds for the southern parties, and in some cases their organization, until the development of the re hellion showed that the property of the survey was not safi,! in certain of the States. Two of our vessels were seized in Charleston harbor, and directions were necessarily given to the assistants in the survey to leave their several localities of work >vhenever they were molested in its execution, or the property of the government was in jeopardy. These instructions were well carried out, the assistants waiting until the necessity for removal was apparent. Insignificant losses of property ouly were sustained, e:xcept in the case of a vessel seized i11 Arausas harbor, Texas, having put in there from uuseaworthinei;s. The survey bas thus made considerable progress on the southern coast, notwithsta11ding the untoward circumstan'-'es of the time. During the spring and summer the parties were removed to the northern sections, and worked there in full force, and with full means, so that this part of the survey has advanced more than in its usual proportion. The call for tbe services of the officers of the army and navy being imperious, the operations generally have been executed by the civilians. Tlte advantages of the organization of tlie work, which have often been stated, were never so fully displayed as in this exigency. The regular work was carried on systematically, though upon a reduced scale. The navy found on its roll, officers who had a knowledge of the harbors and coasts from service on the survey. To the army list were returned officers skilled in reconnaissance, and in the other various operations of the survey, and familiar with the coast and its shore-lines. The vessels of the survey, both steam and sail vessels, were ready in the emergency for the revenue and naval services, and were ·freely yielded to their use. 'fhe material in the Coast Survey office was rapidly put in the shape of hydrographic notes, and by lithographic aud photographic processes the unpublished maps and charts, and memoirs of the coast, were placed at the disj)Osal of the departments of the government, and of the officers engaged in consultations in regard to or in the execution of operations along the coast. The calls for copies of charts of harbors and of the coast of the United States from the active chief of the hydrographic office, to distribute to the vessels of our navy, liarn been numeromi, and have taxed greatly the resources of the office. In the five months preceding the first of November, some six thousand copies of maps and charts have been supplied to the hydrographic office for the use of the navy. Copies of me· 2

moirs and accompanying charts have been furnished to government officers. I shall in my annual rnport c::ill your attention to the expressions l>y the highest authorities of the several services to the great importance of tlrn information furniRhed by the Coast Survey. The direction of its usefulnel's has berm modified l1y circurnstancmi, but its extent has been rather increased than diminit-Jhed. The topographical surveys macle by the a,;sistants of the Coast Survey, in co-operation with the accomplished officers of topographical engineers, have supplied rapidly, maps essential to tl1e operations of the army. Especially has this been the case in the neighborhood of the capital, where tho immediate completion of the map of the District of Columbia, and of its approaches, 'vas called for by the military authorities, and executed by authority of the Secretary of the Treasury, under the joint direction and at the joint cost of tiie Coast Survey and of the military authorities. The A.tlantic coast triangulation is now complete, with an interval of' i;ome sixty miles, from Pm;samaquoddy, in Maine, to M:atanzas inlet, south of St. Augustine, Florida. The gap between Cumberland sound, Georgia, and the St. .John's river, Florida, was filled up last season. The line of coast thus triangulated, measured in the most general way, is not less than L 590 miles. The extension of the surveys in Florida, of the Florida reefs and keys and coast, Louisiana, and Texas, and in the Gulf generally, will be stated in detail in my annual report. The hydrograpby, and perhaps other portions of the work, may be readily extendedfilling up pre-sent deficiencies-by vessels of the Coast Survey accompanying the fleets. The advantage of a regular ESystem by \vhich efforts shall be directed to completing the charts on the coast will be readily appreciated. I have introduced into the estimates such amounts as may be usefully and economically employed for these objects, and am prepared to submit to you the strongest evidence of their importance and practicability, should there be any doubt in relation to them. The progress on the Pacific eoa;;t has been satisfactory, embracing an extension of the nsual work in California, Oregon, and Washington Territory. The diminution of the appropriation, and the changes in the officers serving there, have made certain abatements from the progrei:ls of previous years, which it will be my duty to state in my annual report, notwithstanding which, the progress has been, as above stated, satisfactory. The Secretary of the Navy has consented to the detail of an experienced and enterprising officer for the hydrography on the Pacific coast, to replace the able officer formerly engaged there, a great boon to the survey, 1Yhen the necessity for the exercise of every resource in this important and extensive field is considered. The completion of the telegraph line between San Francisco and Washington will afford us the most admirable and simple means of determiniug the difference of longitude between these points, with an accuracy much beyond that attainable by any other known method. The intelligent president of the line \vill give us every facility for this purpose. In this connexion I may mention that the observations of the Pleiades occultations are yielding, under Professor Peirce's computations, the most promising results for longitude between America and Europe. The estimates include, as urnal, separate items for the Atlantic and Gulf coast, Florida reefs, and Western coast, but they do not suppose the usual facilities from the War and Navy Departments by the detail of officers, except to the very limited extent of the present detail. The civil organization is taken at its present numbers, reduced by voluntary military service, and by other reductions which will be made to the very point where efficiency would be impaired, in the confident expectation that this endeavor to meet the circumstances of the eountry will be appreciated, and that further reductions, which would certainly impair the value of the work,- will not be made.

In 1856-'57 the appropriation for the Coast Survey was $535, 000 ; in U:58 'GH, $452, 800; the exigencies of the treasur)~ in 1860-' 61 caused a reduction to $402, 800. The estimates now presented are for $2~l9, 000, or less by *'103. 800 than the appropriation of hist year. The reduction is twent:r-four per cent. of the amount then appropriatecl, and thirty-four per ecnt. of the amount now estimated. It will enable us to keep the office up to the necef'sary point of efficiency for commn11icating information, indispensable to the goYermnent, aud to continue the field-work and surveys afloat, at the desirable points of progress.

DEVELOPMENTR AND DISCOYERIES.

The list given in Appendix No. 6 is made up by additions from year to year of the discoveries and developments incident to the progress. of the hydrographic work genera1ly, but including also changes found and reported by the land pfirties, as in the case of alteration of shore-line either by the encroachment of the sea in any locality, or the c-ontrary. It could not be expected that the lessened means of pushing the hydrographic work, arising, in part, from the necessary occupation of the Coast Survey vessels in revenue and other government service during the greater part of the year, but chiefly from tlrn withdrawal of officers whose attention had been mainly given to their importance, should furnish as many items as usual of special developments. Such as have been made arc here enumerated, and will also be found appended to the general list before referred to. The existence of points of rock in Sandy bay, Mass., was made known through Mr. W. P. G. Bartlett, of Cambridge. In sounding in smooth water, and in the only weather suitable for continuous hydrography, such obstacles would be struck

with the lead only by the merest accident. The method employed for determining tho exact l·osition of the dangers referred to is ~tated under the head of hydrogrnpliy, in Section I. 1. Determination of tlie positions of four points of rock in Sandy buy, (Cape Ann,) Mass. 2. Special investigation of the currents of Boston harbor. 3. The currents of Cape Cod bay observed with reference to their physica.l effects on the shores. 4. Discovery of three small banks off the Nantucket shoals, in the vicinity of Phelps's bank, and further deYelopmeut of the extent of that shoal ground. 5. Development, by soundings, of a ridge lying sixteen miles off Barnegat, N. J., with eleven to thirteen fathoms of water, and sixteen fathoms between it and the coast. 6. Special examination made and changee noted in the vicinity of the Five Fathom bank, off Cape May. ,. . Hydrographic changes de vol oped in the Delaware river at the Bulkhead shoal, near Fort Delaware; at the bar off Fort Mifflin; and opposite to Philadelphia. 8. Development of important changes in tho hydrography of the bar and channels of Hatteras in1et, N. C.
HYDROGRAPHIO NOTES.

During the past season I have prepared a series of hydrographic notes of the coast for the especial use of the War and Navy Departments. In these I have been aided by the experienced assistants of the Coast Survey, and especially by Carlile P. Patterson, hydrographic inspector, Profeesor W. P. Trowbridge, assistant, C. 0. Boutelle, assistant, and F. H. Gerdes, assistant. These notes have been furnished, through the ilepot of charts and instruments of the navy, to such officers as the superintendent of that establishment deemed it proper to supply; al:m directly from the Coast Survey to bureaus of the "'\t~ar and Navy Departments, and to officers in charge of expeditions. To these notes all the maps of localities which could be rapidly prepared are attached. The first copies of the notes were submitted to the blockade conference, referred to in the report of the honorable Secretary of the Navy, and consisting of Capt. S. F. DuPont, 'G. S. N., the undersigned, Superintendent of the Coast Survey, Brigadier General Barnard, U. S. A., and Commander Chas. H. Davis, U. S. N.
SPECIAL SURVEYS.

To meet the purposes for investigation of a commission, consisting of the chief engineer, General Joseph G. Totten, Commander Charles II. DaviR, and myself, authorized to advise in regard to the preservation of Boston harbor, a resurvey of parts of the harbor was commenced last year, as stated in my annual report. The work required has been continued, and has included the revision of some further portions of the topography, and a thorough examination of the currents of the inner harbor and those of Charles river. The objects sought are the causes of hydrographic changes which have occurred, and the study of them is not the less interesting because complex and laborious. To the patience and zeal of Assistant Henry Mitchell, who has conducted throughout all the observations required by a physical survey, much credit is due for his steady and thorough attention to the objects kept in view by the commissioners. In addition to the observations recorded last season, numerous current stations have been occupied, and the influence of the bridges upon the tides and currents determined by many experiments. Although our results are of the most direct and practical character, we find at every step some points of scientific value, and of more than local interest. Among these I may mention the curves of density of the water determined for different tidal phases and for different distances from the mouth of Charles river. To these curves very peculiar forms are given by the two variables, chemical diffusion and meckan-icd mixture.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

The work in Boston harlrnr has been made the suhject of several 1'pecia1 reports by the United States commissioners, who have instituted these inquirie;;; at the request and at the expense of the city government. The ;.;ame commissioners, under the auspiee:< of the ]egi,:lntnre of Massadrn~ett~, lrnving under consideration certain quest.ions involved in the proposPd construction of a ship canal across Cape Cod peniusula, current olJ:.;ervations lrnve been made for their use at variou;.; t:itatiom; in Cape Cod bay. The objects in tbese were to develop more fully the character and causes of a coaRt current d iRcovered last season, and to fornish information relativ£~ to the race near Provincetown. In these undertakings Assistant Mitchell was very !'Uccessful, and the commissioners are furnished with ample data for a special report on these suhjeets. Experiments on the temperatures and density of the sea were made incidl'ntally in comiexion with the current observations, and have shown some important reLttions. The eold region off the eastern terminus of the proposed Capo Cod canal proves to be a eropping out of the cold substratum of the sea due to the coast current, which pas;.;es up into shallow portions of the hay. The mean temperature of the surface water off the moutu of Scusset ri>er, for the month of July corresponds with the temperature of the sea off Raco Point at a depth of about tii·cnty fathom~. At this latter point the surface water was found in July to be about fifteen degrees l1igher in temperature than that of the lowest i:;trntum. This contrast of temperatures iH favored hy the 1:ncrease qf density with the depth, which was distinctly detected by the hychomcter. The variation in specific gravity seems to exceed the greatest possible range due to c1rn11ges of temperature. If this be so there should be very little alteration in the temperatures of thL· greatest depths for the different seasons, and the cropping out place near Scusset i:;lwuld iu mid winter be warmer than the general surface water of the lmy; a practical result of the highest value. Iu a report made to a committee of the Massachusetts legislature last year by the C uited States. commissiorwrs we announced the disco,·ery of the croppin<J out referred to above, and suggested that the phenomenon had an important relation to the success of the proposed Cape Cod canal and artificial harbor, especially with regard to the much vexed question of the freezing up in winter. An appropriation for a special study of this subject has been made by the legislature. The observationR required to determine the question have llClt ~-et been complicted. Assistant Mitchell carried his inveRtigations along the outer coast of Cape Cod, and found another cropping out of :mb-currents (cokl in midsummer) a mile from the shore of the peninsula, off N ausett. Under authority of the Treasury Department, and by request of the comman<li11g general of the army, topographical surveys in the Yicinity of tho capital have been made, as will be more fu1ly described under the appropriate head, with notice!' of \Vork done in Sectio1: III.
TIDES.

The tidal stations occupied, and results obtained from them, are shown in Appendix No. 10, and the office occupation connected with the observations in the report of Assistant L. F. Pourtales, as chief of the tidal division of the office, Appendix No. 12. The tide tables prepared for the use of navigators were revised in May last, and. under the demand which then existed, were printed in pamphlet form and distributed from the C1.mst Survey office and from the Naval Observatory, for the use of government vessels. Thl'se tables are included with this report, as Appendix No. 9.
INI<'ORMATION FURNISHED.

Appendix No. 4 gives, in the mmal form, a synopsis of the general information furnished from the office during the year, in answer to special calls. The regulation of the department

'When tracing8 or ab;:;tracts from the archives requiring time in their preparation are called for, the actual cost, at the working rntes, is defrayed Ly the applicant. For obvious rcawns, the list roforred to does not include the mention of a large amount of special iuformation supplied at the call of tho various departments of the government, and to officer" in ev\Jry brauch of the public service.
STATISTICS.

The table of statistics has been added to, so as to bring it up to the opening of the present surveying year, and is given in Appendix No. 5. Up to 1860, inclusive, the triangulation had covered an area of nearly sixty-one thousand four hundred Rquare mile~ ; had developed a general extent of coast of over four thousand three hundred, and a shore-line of about twenty-one thousand seven hundred miles, determining nine thousand and fifty geographical positions. For longitude determinations eighty-three stations had been occupied; for latitude, one hundred and twenty-five; and for azimuth, eighty-two stations. The topography had extended over an area of sixteen thousand two hundred square miles, having a general coast line of over three thousand seven hundred, and more than forty thousand miles of slwre-line, measuring the indentations. The hydrography extended over an area estimated at forty-five thousand four hundred square miles, in which more than one hundred and ninety-three thousand miles were run in sounding ; six million one hundred and seventy-four thousand soundings made, and over eight thouo;nrnl two hundred specimens of the bottom obtained. The number of manuRcript maps and charts was two thousand and sixty-eight, and of engraved maps, clrnrts, and sketches, four hundred and seventy plates.
DI8TRIBUTION OF REPORTS AND MA.rs.

The distrilmtion of the report of 1859 has been confined to individuals and institutions in the loyal States of the Union. Of the six t.hmrnand two hunclred extra copies ordered by the t:-ienate and five thousand by the House of Representatives, eight thousand were to be distribnterl from the office. It has been judged expedient during the past year to suspend the usual foreign di:;;tribution through the Smithsonian Institution. More than twenty-one thousand copies of maps, charts, and sketches have been sent from· the office since the date of rny last report-a number exceeding the average yearly distribution by thirteen thousand. This large increase has been due to the demands of the War and Navy Departments, every effort to supply which will continue to be made.
LONGITUDE.

This subject has received two very important. additions from the pen of Professor Benjamin Peirce, of Harvard. The first, (Appendix.No. 16,) entitled "Report upon the determination of the longitudeqf .America awl Europe from the sol(tr eclipse qf July 28, 1851,'' embraces a discussion of all the observations published in this country and in Europe, divided into the following five classes : I. Enropean observations, which record the beginning and the end of the eclipse at the same place; 2. European observi~t.ions, of which the duration of the eclipse is used, but indpendent observations of the beginning and end rejected for want of a reliable longitude ; 3. European ohHervations, of which only one phase of the eclipse is used ; 4. European observations ; 5. American observations. Hansen's lunar tables were employed in the computation. The conditional equations are divided into two sets, one involving the interval of duration, the

other the mean time of phases. The final equations contain, iu; quantities to he determined, the correction to the adopted sum of the semi-diameters, that of the tabular longitude, and that of the assumed longitude of America. 'l'hc longitudes of seYen American stations are determined, and the probable error of the final result for the longitude of \Yashington is only half of a second of time. The second paper (Appendix No. 17) contains the first fruit of a plan adopted for the determination of our longitndes, by observing occultations of the Pleiades. To render this rather intricate reduction more generally uReful, I have thought it expedient to insert the report of Professor Peirce in full, as an example for similar computations. The period between the years 1838 and 1842 is now under discussion, and the example given treats the cmcrsions of September 26, 1839. Observations, taken at. six places in Europe and America, have been collected. To the method of reduction which was giYen in Appendix No. 24 of my annual report for 1856 some auxiliary formulre have since been added. In the computation Hansen's lunar tables were used. The probable error to be assif!'ned to the final result for longitude from all the occultations is estimated not to exceed one-tenth of a second of time, and the greater part of that estimated error is due to uncertainty in the lunar parallax. The longitude deduced in this example agrees well "·ith the result found by the tliscusflion given in the preceding paper. In Appendix No. 18 will be found an abstract of the elaborate report made by Dr. B. A. Gould, on the difference of longitude hetween the citie,; of Albany and New York. The line of telegraph was used for the observations, connexion beiug made throug:h it between a station in the grounds of the Dud!f~y Observatory, at Alban:~, and the private observatory of L. :M. Rutherford, esq., in New York city. The method employed is the same that has been applied to the determination of the longitude of all the principal points on the coast of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, and has been repeatedly mentioned in my previous reports.
SOLAR ECLIPSE OF JULY 1860.

In addition to the observations of this eclipse, given in m~· hu;t annual report, I have inserted in the Appendix of this report (Nos. 19, 20, and 21) ab8tracts of the obsen·ations made at the Coast Survey station on Gunstock mountain, and at Cambridge, :Mass., and War,;hington city. It i8 expected that the combined observatiJns of this eclipse will yield a Yalllable result to the determination of our principal longitudes.
OCCULTA.TIONS OF PLEIADES, ETC.

During the past year the charts of predictions of occultations of tlie Pleiades h>~ve been forwarded, in pursuance of the general plau proposed by Professor Peirce, of Cambridge, Mass., and committed to his execution. The computation;; have l1een made, as heretofore, -by Mr. Edward Pearce, jr., under the general direct.ion of Professor Peirce. The list embraced twenty-eight stations in Europe and twenty-four in AmericE1. Charts for the series of December 24, 1860, were f'orwarded to the fornig11 H11d Jo 1l1u American stations, and fur the series of February 17, 11'61, to the foreign statio11:s (·1ily, tl1e occultations of that date not being visible in America. Returns of forty-nine results have been received from the .A.merican stations. The records of twenty-six moon culminations, ob;;erved at Cincinnati, Lave Leen furni:-died by Professor 0. M. Mitchel.

nnmher of stations alonp: our Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coast, to which some adj<1cent foreign station" have been added. TbiR paper, like the preceding ones on the secular change of the other magnetil· elements. gives us the meaus of referring ob,;erved inten~ities to a common epoch, for the purpose of comparison and combination. The comparatively short period of time since intensity observatio11s were first made, (heginniug with the present century,) as well as the difficulty of expressing the older relative values in absolute measure, has necessarily delayed the investigation, at least until approxim>tte resultB could be expected from the material. 'l'he discussion embraces thirty-six stations, with a total of two hundred and seventy obi;ervatio11s collected, and now combined for the present investigation. All value" have been expressed in the Erigli8h units of grains and feet. Ou the Atlantic coast the horizontal force is found decreasing; on the Pacific coa;;t it is increasing ; but the total force is very nearly stationary. The second paper (Appendix No. 23) contains a new discussion of the magnetic <leclin,1tion along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, a paper of direct practical character and of scientific interest. The epoch to which all the observations were referred is January, 1860, and the di;;cu~;;iou is therefore au enlarged edition of my paper on the distribution of terrestrial magnetit;rn, for the epoch 1850, given in the appendix of the annual reports for 1855 and 1856. The earliest observation admitted in the new discussion was made in 1840, and the total number used iR thirty-six, or more than twice the number used before. The secular change is folly discussed within the limits of the paper. Some few oliservations were admitted from other than Coast Survey records. The most approved formula was employefl for the analytical expression of the distribution of magnetism, for which purpose six groups were formed. The probable error of a single representation is very small. This, as well as the next paper, concerning the variation of the compass, was prepared for the immediate use of our naval squadrons, and the results of both were printed in pamphlet form and furnished to the proper officer;; of the government during the summer. The third paper (Appendix No. 24) shows the distribution of magnetic declination in J auuary, 18GO, along the lower part of the Atlantic coast of the United States. The discussion is similar to that in the preceding paper, and comprises twenty-one observations. The results are shown graphically for the Atlantic coast and for the Gulf of Mexico in Sketch No. 30.
SOLAR SPOTS.

In Appendix No. 25 are given the records of these observations to .Tanuary, 18G2, made hy Aiosi~tant Schott, iu continuation of a series published in the appendix of my last annual report. Their probable connexion with terrestrial magnetism has been heretofore discussed.
HEIGHTS.

The collection of data for representation on a map of heights in North America, carried in conjunction \Yith the Smithsonian Institution, has been continued during the past year. About fifteen hundred poi1its have been obtaiued since lust year's report, making, in all, over fourteen thousand points, derived from explorations for roads and railroads and geologicHl surveys, as well as from the constructed lines of canals and railroads. The collection of maps of States, counties, and minor details made during the prosecution of this work, by Mr. ·w. L. Nicholson, has been of imrvice in the present. demand for precise knowledge of the topography of the interior ; bringing out, at the same time, more and more, the need for thorough trigonometrical surveys to reconcile and avoid the discrepancies in positions and the omissions apparent in so many of the existing maps of the interior.

EXPERBIBNTAL D!QrIRIER.

Though the interest in regard to improvements in instrument" aud apparnlus has not been lessened, but few occasions during the year have called for the application of irnplcmlmhi not already in use. A new form of sounding apparatus, devii;ed by Profesrnr ''"· P. Trowliridp:e, to register depths in comparatively shallow water, bas been tried with success. The results arc given in Appendix No. 11. In the office, experiment8 have been made to test the relati\"C accurac~"· for c-ritical purposes, with reference to the shrinkage and expam;ion of manuscript maps on pard1me11t paper, ~1s compared with the same if made on backed drawiug paper. Tlw re~ults. gi\"Cll in Appendix No. 15, and also shown graphically in Sketch No. 31, are conclu,;ive in farnr of the paper backed with common muslin.
OFFICERS OF THE AmIY.

The names of officers of the army on Coast Survey serYice at the opening of the present surveying year are given in Appeudix No. 2, as also tl1e datei" at which some \Yere detach<"d by orders from the War Department, and at which others resigned. Of twelve officers then attached, and qualified not only by natural aptitude, but also by experieuce in the field or office, only two remain on the list, both actively enµ;aged in their profession, and ready for calls which would necessarily be preceded by orders detaching them formally. Captain (IJow Major) \Y. R. Palmer, of the corps of topographical engineers, is still in charge of tho Coast Survey office, but is also actively on duty as a member of the staff of thf' commanding general. Captain T. J. Oram, of the same corps, an officer of great experience in field service in the 8111-. vey, is at present on military duty at Fortress Monroe, though not withdrawn from the employments of the Coast Survey by formal order. With the loss of his assistance must lw cmmted that of Lieutenants George Bell, 0. D. Greene, V\T. R. Terrill, and W. Craig from the list of field assistants, and Lieutenants J. R. Smead, N. H. McLean, and Thomas Wrilson from the Coast Snrvey office, detached on the 18th of April in consequence of the crisis which was then hastening in the affairs of the nation. Three other officers, viz : Captain .M. L. Smith, of tlie topographical engineers, and Lieutenants R. G. Cole and W'. G. Gill, had previously rcRigned, the first at the beginning of .April, the i:;ecoml on the 10th of January, and the last named at the beginning of February. These officern were at those rcspcctive dates either engaged or making preparation for continuing field duties, which all of them had disclmrged acceptahly in the preceding season. Aside from their qualifications for the work of the Coast Survey, on ·which it would be here in place to remark, I would take the occal'!ion to place on public record, as less than their due, official mention of the inflexible E'pirit of loyalty manifeRted by the younger offieers previous to the emergency which withdrew them in April laE't. My regret in pnrting with them has been tempered not only by the occurrences which returned them to the line of their profession, but also by the cheering conviction that the spirit which has carried them through great personal trials has been committed to men who arc not likely to be moved by any hut p1·inciples of consistency and honor. The fact may be pas,,e<l that the confusion of 1-'ocial relations only in a slight degree affected several of the officeTS referred to. The trial of principle i11 the case of two, at least-Lieutenants Terrill and BeJl-was such as few mon have met, and fr\1·er resisted. That in the emergency which had arisen such men were found in positions of special usefulness, in which they had engaged when the calls of their profession 1Yere not imperative, cannot be regarded as fortuitous. The way being open, they pressed in, accepting toil and hardship cheerfully on the road to usefulness. One was engaged in triangulation on the coast of Florida, and the other on the coast of Texas, wben our national affairs became involved. Boi.h were energetic and sagacious in the discharge of duty, am] 1otb hid fair t.u rank with

the ablest, as they do with the most highly· esteemed, officers who have been associated with the labors of the Coast Survey. The charge of the Drawing Division, the operations of which had been directed for several years with marked ability by Lieutenant Thomas Wilson, was, soon after his detachment from the survey, assigned to Captain T. J. Lee, with the sanction of the Treasury Department. The precision in details and method practiced by Lieutenant 'Wilson in couducting work have added much to the efficiency of the division. Lieutenant G. H. Blliot, of the corps of engineers, continues the supervision of the tidal observers on the Western coast., under an arrangement which, as it does not interfere with his general duties, bas been cordially acceded to by the chief engineer of the army.
OFFICERS OF THE NAVY.

"\Vben the surveying year opened, the prospects iu regard to the hydrographic work laid out for execution were bTight. The number of officers spared by the ~ avy Department was small, but they weTe well acquainted with the requirements of the survey, and, nnder ordinary circumstances, they would have sustained amply the reputation which they had rapidly eaTned as skilful and energetic hydrographers. Commander James Alden was detached, at his own request, in October, 1860, and had been replaced on the list by the assignment of Commander D. D. Porter to the charge of the hydrographic work on the Western coast. The last-named officer, ·whose experience on the survey in former years, and ·well-known energy and intelligence, gave large promise of public benefit, had completed his preparations for proceeding to the Pacific coast just before our national troubles began to take shape. An early occasion requiring, for the immediate honor of the goyernmcnt, the strength of an indomitable will, and loyalty as inflexible, took him necessarily from the list on which his name had stood so high. This was at the end of March. Events which quickly followed in the record of national disa>.ter withdrew the officers then left in the service of the Coast Survey, with a single exception, the immediate necessities of the government requiring that at least one trained hydrographer should remain subject to its call for special duty. The allotment fell on Lieut. Comg. T. S. Phelps, whose labor,; have not intermitted throughout the year. Lieut. Comg. J. C. Febiger was detachec.1 on the 22d of May, and Lieut. Comg. J.P. Bankhead on the 8th of June. The first-named officer had been only recently assigned to a second peTiod of <luty in the survey, and the second was under instructions, at the opening of the season, for the prosecution of work in '\d1ich he had previously shown great zeal and aptitude. .Allusion will be made, under another head in this report, to the site of work and duties assigned to this able officer, and to the circumstances which made their execution impracticable. There being at the critical juncture in public affairs which was passing in May no hydrographic officer on the Western coast, the honorable Secretary of the Navy, at my suggestion, assigned for that important duty Commander B. F. Sands, an officer of large experience, prudence, and ability. As was expected, Commander Sands has since that date co-operated with the military authorities in California iu active service, (see Appendix No. 32,) and when the emergency passed which had called for it bas advanced the hydrography. His resources, gained by previous duty on the Coast Survey, and natural energy of character, abundantly qualify Lim for sustaining the interests of the government in either line of service within his profession, as circumstances may require. Appendix No. 3 gives, in the form of a list, the names of all the officers who were attached to the survey last spring, and the dates at which they were either severally detached, or withdrew from the service. The efficiency of the hydrographic office, which had been left vacant by the departure of Commander S. S. Lee and Lien tenant Silas Bent at the end of April, was restored early in May by Captain Carlile P.

Of the other officers whose names are given in the list in Appendix Xo. 3, three, viz: Commander W. T. Muse, Lieutenant John Wilkinrnn, and Lieutenant C. M. :Fauutleroy, had been engaged in bydrographic duty during the precediug autumn. The labors of Pach of them had been marked by zeal and succeRs. Lieutenant H. P. Pegram had been recently assigned to duty in the survey, and was preparing for service afloat when he resigned from naval service.
AIDS TO NAVIGATION.

The result of an examination, made by directiou of the Treasury Department, "·ith refer. ence to the expediency of erecting a light-house at the entrance of Gray's harbor, W. T., i:;; given in Appendix No. ~4. The usual progress of the hydrography has brought to the notice of the chiefa of parties in previous seasons the desirableness of minor aids to navigation, ai; beacous, buoys, aud leading marks in the vicinity of channels. These have been communicated from time to time for the information of the Light-house Board. This year, by reason of the fact that along a large part of the coast of the United States the light-houses and day marks have been destroyed, the remarks have been confined to few localities, and chiefly refer to replacing marks that had previously existed.
OBITTJARIES.

The opening of the present surveying year was sadly marked by the death of Mr. A.. W. Thompson. He entered the survey in March, 1857, and until within a short period before his decease was steadily engaged in field duty, where, by his gentleness and devoted fidelity to the interests intrusted to him, he won the esteem of all with whom he was associated. Mr. Thompson served as a volunteer in the astronomical expedition to Labrador in July, 1860, and after its return rejoined the field party with which he had been pre\·iowsly on duty. While 011 service with the expedition he contracted a cold which ended in consumption, of which he died, at his home in Philadelphia, on tho 19th of December, 1860. Another of the aids, Mr. M. 0. Hering, of excellent attainments in that grade, died of the same wasting disease on the 6th of November, after a lingering illness. He had served with constant fidelity during several years, and his varied talents-haviug, amongst other qualifications, considerable skill as a draughtsman-were always brought to bear fully in the furtherance of any work with which he had to do. Mr. Hering had also been attached to the Coast Survey office, aud was highly esteemed for his kind and .manly disposition.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

PART I I.
In the same general order in which the work of the present year has been mentioned in the preceding pages, detailed statements will now be given of the progress made in each locality of the coast to which parties have been sent. As far as practicable, the field work and hydrography will be arranged in geographical order. The triangulation, as preceding the plane-table work in the field, will be noticed first, generally, but jointly with other operationH when the same party has carried on the topography and soundings.
SECTION I.
FROM PASSAMAQUODDY BAY TO POINT JUDITH, INCLUDING THE COAST OF THE STATES OF MAINE, NEW HAMPSHIRE. MAS~ACHFSETTS, AND RHODE JSLAND.-(SKETCHEB Nos. l, 2, AXD 3.)

Separate notice ·will be taken of work clone in the several localities in this section, in the follmving order: 1. Progress in tho triangulation and the taking up of the topographical and hydrographic survey of l'assamariuoddy bay in the vicinity of Eastport harbor. 2. The extension of the secondary triangulation of the coast of Maine over the bayR and harbor,; Letween Moose-a-hec island and Mount Desert, including the mouths of several of the rivers emptying into them. 3. Triangulation of the coast of :Maine autl i,;lands in the vicinity of hle au Hant, connecting with tbe preliminary work done in Penobscot bay and that going eastward from Mount Desert. 4. The triangulation of Penobscot bay continued from the Fox rocks northward, anrl reaching nearly to the head of the bay. 5. Primary triangulation completed in this section for counecting the primary base on Epping Plains, Me., with the base on Fire island in Section II. Magnetic observations were made in connexion with the geodetic work. 6. Trianguh:tion in the npper part of Narragansett bay, to furnish points for the topographical survey and hydrography. 7. Topography of Rockland barho1-, Me., and of the adjacent western shore of Penobscot Lay a,; far south as Fogg hill, below Thomaston. 8. Plane-table survey continued on the shores of Back river, between the Sheepscot and Kennebec, including Hoakomoak and Hanson's bays and parts of Woolwich peninsula. 9. Topography continuetl at the junction of the Kennebec and Androscoggin rivers, and embracing the immediate vicinity of the banks of both rivers above the junction. 10. Shore line survey of the upper part of Casco bay, between Little Flying Point and Drinkwater' s Point, including the shores of Freeport and Yarmouth rivers. This survey embraces also some detailed topography within the limits stated, and a portion of the surface features of Harpswell N eek. 11. Topography of the shore of Cape Cod bay in the vicinity of West Sandwich completed. This work connects the plane-table survey of the mouth of Scusset river with the survey of Barnstable harbor. 12. Topographical survey commenced by tracing the shores of Mount Hope bay and filling in partR of the details, including its i·ivers, the islands in the vicinity, and the contiguous shores of the upper part of Narragansett bay. 13. Hydrography of the Kennebec river continued from Bath northward through Merrymeeting ba:;>, and in the Androscoggin river to its lower bridges.

Progress has !Jeen made in the drawing and engraving of coal't maps and charts No. 8, Atlantic coast, from Seguin island to Kennebunkport; No. U, from Cape N eddick to Cape Ann; No. 11, from Plymouth harbor to Hyannis harbor ; and in the engraving of general coast chart No. II, from Cape Ann to Gay Head; in that of preliminary sea-coast chart No. 3, Cape Small Point to Cape Cod; and on the chart of Portland harbor. The drawing has been continued and the engraving commenced of the chart of the Sheepscot and Kennebec rivers; and the drawing has been commenced of general sea-coast chart No. I, Atlantic coast, from Quoddy Head to Cape Cod; of coast map and chart No. 7, :Muscongus bay to Portland; and for a finished chart of Barnstable harbor. 'Triangulation, topography, and Ttydrography ef Pa.s.~am.aq11oddy bay, lJfc.-The survey of Passamaquoddy bay was in full progress at the usual period for taking up work in Section I, and, under the stress of circumstance;,; which had withdrawn the usual assistance from the Navy Department, the three classes of work were confided to Assistant 0. 0. Boutelle. Mr. C. H. Boyd, under his <lireetion, ;vas assigned to carry forward the triangulation. The topog· raphy was placed in charge of Sub-A,,.sistant \V. H. Dennis. Mr. Robert Platt, the ctlicicnt first officer of the Arago, and Mr. E. W illenbucher, an experienced hydrographic draughtsman, were associated with the party, the soundings being m<i.de under the immediate direction of Mr. Boutelle. The stations occupied for the t.riangulation ref<t on the shores of the Bay of Fundy, on Campo Bello and Deer islands, and on some of the smaller islands of Passamaquoddy bay; in the vicinity of Eastport. These were Helected so as to join with the primary triangulation of the coast of Maine, as ·well as to furnish points for the thorough survey of the shores and islands belonging to the United States, and to show their positions relative to the shore and islands across the boundary, in the province of New Brunswick. This duty was prosecuted b{'tweeu the 20t.11 of July and the 11th of Noveml·er. A few of the stations of last year were reoccupied.

REPORT OF TBE Sl"PEilINTENDENT OF

All the records of the triangulation have been duplicated, and the computations are now in propT8SS in the hands of Mr. Boyd . .A.ssit<tant Boutelle was recalled ut the close of October by a pressing emerg·ency for his services in Port Royal sonud, S. C., his intimate peri'onal kno\Yledge of that locality being deemed of importance as hearing on the s11cceRs of an expeclition deRtirn:d to restore it to the posscst<io11 of the government. I had preYiously visited the working ground of the party near Ea8tport. Tlic topography of Passarnaqnodl1y ba~', in charge of Sub-Assistant Dennis, "\Yas limited to the requirements of the part~- engap:ed in sounding ·with the schooner Arago. Two sheets were projected-one to define the shore-line of the passage bet.ween Deer ishrnd and Campo Bello, (:-'ketch No. 2,) the other to contain the entire shore of Moose island and tho adjacent slwres of Campo Bello, Deer islm1d, and part of tl1e shore of Passamaquoddy bay. While engaged uncl!'.T the direction of J\1 r. Bcrntelle, Hub-Assistant Denni,:; traced about fifty miles of shore-line. He wus recalled on the lGth of October, a11cl uss!gned to duty in the vicinity of Washington city, (~ection III,) and later in the season in Port Royal sound, where Le is still on duty. The limits of the hydrography correRpoml neoirly with those of the plane-table sheets. 'l'he soundings were made during the month of August, and comprise the h)·drography of Eastport harbor and anchorage, (Sketch No. 2.) Progress was made in sounding the entrance to Passamaquoddy bny, but the completion of work there was deferred for special duty elsewhere. In the course of the season about four hundred miles were run in souudings, and about eight tlwusaml casts made with thLe lead. The strong tidal current made it necessary that. sextant angles should be taken at each cast. A. tide gauge was established at Lubec and another at Eastport, and both were read day and night while the soundings were in progress. The experienc;e of Mr. Platt, who had served acceptably in several of the hydrographic parties of the Coast Survey in former f'easons, added to his energy and intelligence, qualified the party in the Arago fully for the difficulties met with in prosecuting the hydrograph}'· The progress of work was suspended by spec;ial duty int:identally devolved on the party of Assistant Boutelle, in the absence of any other government veso;el at Eao;tport. Under the authority of the col]edor of customs at Eastport, Mr. Boutelle in the last of AU!:~ust seized t\YO ships, the Express and Orizimba, said to be wholly or in part owned by parties in New Orleans, and subject to confiscation under the 3Ct of Congress approved August 6, 1861. On the 4th of September the ship Alice Ball, of New Orleans, was taken by tbe A.rago in the Bay of Fundy, the schooner being then on a cruise at the request of the collector. The three vessels were left in his cut>tody at Eastport, the circumstances attending tlieir capture being made known at once to the department.. \Yhen the hydrography was about to be resumed, Mr. Platt and an armed party from the Arago were called on to quell a mutiny on hoard of the American ship General Norvell, and promptly put the mutineers in the custody of the proper authorities. A. laden brig which had run on a ledge of rock in Eastport harbor was relieved from distress and got afloat by the party under ~Ir. Platt. A.side from the interruptions alluded to, the soundings were continued until near the middle of October, when the Arago sailed for New York, and after refitting joined the blockading squadron then about to sail from Hampton roads for Port Royal sound, under the orders of Commodore DuPont. Triangulcdion of Pro.sped lwrlior, Goldsborough, Dyer's, Pigeon Hi'.ll, and Narragu.agus bays, Pleasant bay, and Cape Split harbor, Jl,.fe.-The secondary triangulation of the coast of Maine, east of Mt. Desert, was rmmmed early in July by Sub-Assistant F. P. Webber, and has been extended northward and eastward (Sketch No. 2) over the indented coast. and harbors between Frenchman's bay and Moose-a-bee island. Mr. Webber took up the work at Schoodic station, and erected signals during the part of the season which was most unfavorable for observing with the theodolite. The secondary triangulation of this year is connected with the primary work in the vicinity of the Epping base, and furnishes points for the plane-table survey of

Prinmry triangulation.for connecting Fire i,;land base with Epping base.-The party under my immediate direction was organized for field service in this section and in Section II in the latter part of June. :Monar1noc mountain, in the tO\Ynship of Jaffrey, Cheshire county, N. H., was occupied by my party for extending the primary triangulation in a straight course towards the Fire island base. The preliminary arrangements were made at the station, as usual, by Mr. Thomas McDonnell, and on their completion, near the middle of July, Assistant George W. Dean took up the geodetic observations and completed them without delay. Urgent official engagements connected with the public service, to which further allusion need not be now made, delayed my departure from ·w ashiugton, so as to make it impracticable to visit the party before its transfer to a second station in Section II. Five primary signals were observed on from the station on Monadnoc with the thirty-inch theodolite, C. S. No. 1. The most distant one was about sixty two miles from the instrument. In the measurement of horizontal angles four hundred and forty-four observations were recorded. Vertical angles were measured on the five stations, and ·in so doing four hundred and twenty observations were made with the eight-inch Gambey circle, C. S. No. 57. The usual meteorological registers were kept during the stay of the party on Mount :Monadnoc. All the records connected with the primary work of the season have been duplicated and deposited in the Coast Survey office. Sub-Assistant R. E. Halter assiAted Mr. Dean in this and in the adjoining lower section, notice of whic:h will be made in the next chapter. Mr. R. H. Talcott served as aid in the triangulation party until September 5, and then tendered his resignation. Jiagnctfo ob.w~rvation.s on .~fount 21/onadnoc, N. H.-Four complete series of observations were made near the geodetic station on Mount Monadnoc by Assistant G. W. Dean and Sub-Assistant R. E. Halter in .August, for determining the magnetic dip; and at Troy Village, five miles in a southwesterly direction from the mountain, the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity, were ascertained by the same observers. For that purpose, eighty observations were made on differ· ent days for the declination; two complete sets for determining the horizontal intensity, and moment of inertia; and three !"ets for ascertaining the dip of the needle. The records of these observations are at the office, in duplicate. Dcclinometcr, C. S. No 1, and dip circle, C. S. No. 4, were used in making the observations.

The sheet of work done on the Kennebec will be plotted at the ofllce, ,d1ere arrangerneub; have been made for the completion of the chart. In preliminary form the reduction from it is given as Sketch No. 4, ·with this report. Hydrograpliy of Ca,~co liay, 11.Ie.-At the limih; of the completed survey of Portfand harbor and of the hydrography of the approaches to 0'1sco hay, the soundings in the upper part of the bay "·ere commenced by Assistant C. A. Schott on the 1st of August with a party in the schooner Joseph Henry. The work of tLe season was prosecuted with energy and intelligence, and the reF<nlt has gone far towards tLe completion of the hydrography of Casco hay. 1'he Lydrogntphic i:;heet represents the entire breadth of the bay from Harpswell N eek and Crotch and .Tewell'"' island. we>itward to the main land. Its southern limit follows the outline of Portland harbor, :u1<l the limits of sounding-;< made at the approaches of the bay hy Lieutenants Commanding- \V uodhulL Trenchard, rincl ~Wilkinson. Northward, the hydrogrnphy was extended by Assi,.;taut Sl'hott to a line parallel with the upper end of Cousin's island. These limits are marked on Sketch No. ~- \Yhere the work joined with that of previous years, additional lines were run, particularly in Hussey sound. The season's work includes Lucksc' s and the greater part of Broad sound. In connexion with the h3 drography, regular tidal observations were ma<le, day anrl night, at Harp~well during four weeks, and for seven weeks and a half at Peak's i1.dand. A third station at :Man's Point, near Yarmouth, was occupied temporarily for the purpose of tracing the progress of the tide wave, and in connexion with the regular 1rnries at Peak's i,.;land, high and low water was repeatedly observed and recorded at a fourth station, near the southwest end of Long island, for the same object. In judiciously selected localities, Mr. Schott observed thP currents at two! ve Rtations during three or four consecutive tides. The original records of soundings, angles, and tidal oht<ervations, comprising, with the meteorological jonrnal8, twelve volumes, have been duplicated, and both sets are now at the office, in 'Yashington. Af<si:>tant Schott was occupied in the l1ydrography of Casco bay until the 21st of October, soon after which he re:mmed the charge of the computing division of the office. The following are statistics of the hydrographic work: :Miles run in sounding··· · · · · ......... · .....·.................... 574 Angles n1ea:1ured · · · · · · · · · - · ............. - ..................... . 3,890 Nurnber of soundings······ · ·. · · .. · .... · ... · ·. · · ·. · · ............ . 20,954 Mr. E.

I inspected the working methods used in the party about the middle of Oetobcr, and found them thorough and practical in every respect. Development of rocks in Snndy hay, (Cape Ann,) 1lfass.-Towards the close of the present season, aud after the conclusion of work in other parts of this section, Assistant Henry Mitchell visited Sandy bay and detNmined tbe position of a rock, the existence of which had been communicated to me by }fr. ·w. P. G. Bartlett, of Cambridge. Of four points of rock found, :Mr. Bartlett, who accompanied the party, recognized one as being the obstacle to which he had directed attention. Mr. l\fitchell says, in reference to all of them: ''They could scarcely have been found by sounding, on account of their forms. They are sharp projections from the bottom, and are surrounded by three to seven fathoms of water. In order to develop them, we placed ourselves upon the rocky cliffs at a time when a very heavy swell prevailed along the coast, and took angles upon well-defined breakers in the distance. Having plotted the positions of these breakers upon a chart, we visited tho spots when the sea became calm, and <lrnpped the lead directly upon the rocks." The four rocks determined by this examination will be at once marked for insertion on the plate of the chart of Rockport harbor, Cape Ann.

Since that date :Mr. Samuel ·walker has had the care of the series. A selfregistering tape and a preFRllre tide-gm1ge were uRed. The working of the fatter, as an experiment, is not yet e011clusi,·e, owing to the difficulty in having repairs ·made to the apparatus in the vicinity of the station. I visited Eastport early in October, and personally inspected the arrangements for continniug the Heries. At the CharlestowD navy yard Mr. T. E. Ready has continued his series of observations unbroken, as in the several preceding years. The high and ]ow waters are noted by means of a staff-gauge, the position of which has been changed a few paces to avoid ohf:.tructions that would otherwise prevent. the readings at low water. The city authoritie8 having provided a self-rq6stering: gauge, tlifl obRervations desirable for tlw special resurvey of Boston harbor have also been attended to by Mr. Ready, and are yet in progress.

Topography aml Hy(ll'O!Jrapl1y qf Hacl8on river.-The regular survey of the Hudson haR been advanced iu two localities by a party in clmrge of Sub-Assistant Jolrn Meehan. From a point one mile south of .Anthony's Nose, upwards to Sherman's wharf, above Newburg, the shore-line was accuratel.v traced for two hyurog·rnpl1ic sheets of last year which contain the sounclings executed by Lieutenant Commauding Fauntleroy. .After completing thiR duty the party of ~lr. :Meehan, in the schooner Genles, moved to Rl1inebeck, where the shore-lino survey and hydrography were jointly resumed and extended to Tivoli. The work of this year connects in that vicinity with a survey made in 1858 by Lieutenant Commanding Murray.A. tide-gange used in conjunction with the hydrographic operations was read every fifteen minutes, and showed a mean rise and fall of 4.6 feet. \Vithiu the limits of the sheet projected by Mr. Meclrnn he completely developed the shoals in the Hudson known as "The Flats" and "Hog's B;ick," and nbo those immediately opposite to Tivoli.

On approaching Barnegat from tltc eoutlnvard a line of sounding-fl waR carried by tho part;~ iu the Vixeu to show <lcptlrn bctweeu a station fiftccu miles tli"taut from Ihnteg:tt and tho lig;ht-lioat, which if' i1ow moored about a mile rnntl1cac't frnm tlrn thirteen feet "l'"t off Cape May. In that Yicinity the shoab to the northward of tl10 Five-F<itlwm lmnk \\·c1-e careful!:· examiuod. The soundings as marked on tho Coast SurYcY drnrt of 1852 wore found unchrn1;2:ed, excepting at ouc E'pc>t, in refcTeucc to which Lieute;1ant Cornmauding Phelps rer>orts a;: follows: ''The small shoal with three and a half fathoms on it, g·ivcn on the chart a,.: l1ci11g- fonr miles north of tho bank, has partially di>'appe:trcd, tlie soundinµ:c: llOW ranging from four uml a half to six fathoms, with f'even, eight, anu nine fathoms around it." One hnndrcd and forty-one miles were run while sounding l>y th<' party in the Vixen. Uncfor the head of the next two sections further mention will be made of the occupation of this hydrographic party. Eydrogravhic resurvey of the Drlaii-are river, nem· Philadelp!iia. Fort Jlf(!lin, and Fod Delaware.-Speeial instTuctious wore given to .A.ssistaut George DaYid1<on on tho 2Cth of Aus:nst to make a hydrographic resurvey of certain portiorn; of the llclawnrn rin~r in order to cletcrmi11c what chaugeR had taken pl:tee since the firnt survey. This was direetcu with reference to pur· poses of defence. The first portion examined embraced the Delaware oppol"ite Philadelphia, arid exhibits marked changes in the eastern channel alJreast of the upper part of Camden. the bar from the upper end of .Windmill island hin-ing formed almost to Cooper's Point. The sboal formerly extending far below 'Yindmill island appeaTs to have been much cut away. Important additions to the wharves are being made along the Philadelphia front by extending them to tho port warden's established line; several wharves have been built out from Camdeu; aud a continuous wharf has been constructed around Wimlmill island. These changes, when complded, will materially affect the condition of the channel and shoals of the Delaware. The second portion of the resurvey comprised the river between Red Bank and Billinµ:sport, including "the bar" and tl1e approaches to Fort Miillin. Changes lrn\'C l1eeu tlc\elopeu in this Yicinity, and the preliminary Tcdnction8 indicate a depth of one foot more \niter 011 tho bar than was found in the original survey. .A.s:3istant DaYidson suggests that it would be a material aicl to navigation if there should be fixed to the light-house pier, ai1cl to the wl1arf at Billingsport, large and distinctly graduated sta{fo to indicate to outward a11d inward bouud heavily-laden vessels the depth of water on tlic ba,r between the buoy8. The third portion of the riYer resurveyed was between New Castle and Reed.'" Point. including the Bulkhead shoal and the r..pproad1os to Fort Delaw;ire. Part of the shoal l1etwcen Delaware City and Pea Patch i,;land has been cut away, and important chang<:s appear to have taken place below the island. The preliminary rednctious :-how that the eastern channel along Hie Bulkhead shoal remains the deeper. The small marshy patches, formerly known as tho Goose islands, have disappeared. The positicns of all the buoys have Leen accurately doter_ mined . .A.t the request of tlie officer commandiug Fort Delaware, (Captain A. . .A.. Gibson, 2d artillery, United States army,) Assistant Davidson was instructed to make the resuryoy bet we cu Reedy Point and Fort Delaware, and also to mab~ a ininute survey immediately around the Pea l'ateh island. A copy of this 1vork will be transmitted to the chief of the corps of engineers, linikd States army. Assistant Davidson acknowledges the kindness of Captain Gibsou ill fumi"hi11:; him with a boat belongiug to the fort whilst executiug the above survey. Tidal stations were established at each of the foregoing localities, aml rnarks left for reference. 'l'he tide-gauge readingR at two of the stations were referred to the tidal ~tafis ut tho Philadelphia navy yard and at Fort Delaware.

Assistant Whiting has had the immediate supervision of the field parties, tl1e labors of which since Augm;t have been under the general direction of Lieut. Colonel J. N. Macomb, topographical engineer-in-chief of the army of the Potomac. The co-operation necessary to meet the requirements of die commanding general has been systematic alld effective, the topographer;; being al ways in readiness, and the means of transportation and details of men promptly supplied. Plane-table survP::J qf the Potomac river.-N ear the middle of October, 18()0, a dou hie party, with the schooner Guthrie, was detailed to execute the topography of the sbores of the Potomac between Piney Point and Blakistone island.-(8ketch Ko. 10.) ~.\.ssistant I. Hull A.dams and Sub-Assistant S. A. Wainwright at once took up the work with separate plane-tables, the object being- to complete the detailed survey of the banks of the river as far up as tlie triaugn· lation had been carried by .Assist.ant Farley. The shore-line of both sides of the Potomac was traced by the parties, and alt<o the mouths of several creeks, Blake's on the north or Maryland side and Jackson's and Muchodac creek on the Virginia side. On account of the unfavorable weather which set in before the close of October it was found impracticable to take up the detailed topography. The two parties traced au aggregate of about thirty-eight miles of shorn-line and filled in two square miles of interior. The Potomac is from four to five miles wide where the parties 'vorked. About a fortnight at the outset of t.hc surveying season was employed in replacing the signals left by the triangulation party, most of them having been blown down by storms. After closing work the vessel was sent to Baltimore and laid up. Mr. Adams was employed in Section I during the summer. Sub-Assistant Wainwright resigned his position in the survey on the 25th of June to enter the army. Special examinations on the Potomac river.-In the first week of June a topographical and hydrographic reconnaissance was made at "'bite House Point and at Mathias Point on the south side of the Potomac, and also of the vicinity of Lower Cedar Point on the Maryland side of the river. This duty was executed by Captain IY. R. Palmer, of the topographical engineers, assistant in charge of the Coast Survey C'ffice, in the small steamer Resolute, then in command of Acting Master Budd. Commander Rowan, with the sloop of war Pawnee, convoyed the party and placed the boats of that vessel at our disposal for taking eoundings. In each instance the shore of the immediate vicinity was traced and mapped, and lines of soundings were run quite across the bed of the Potomac. Copies of the resulting sketches were immediately furnished to the military authorities of the government. Acting Lieutenant Blue, of the Pawnee, assisted in running the lines of soundings. Two hydrographic draughtsmen, Mr. Charles Junken antl Mr. IV. :F'. Sa11ds, of tlie Coast Survey office, accompanied Captain Palmer and mapped the rcsultR of the obs<c'n;ations.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

In July Lieut. Comg. T. S. Phelps, U.S. N., assistant Coast Survey, with the steamer Vixen, made a thorough examination off the ·False cape of the coast of Yirginin, and the result shows that no shoal of natural formation exists in the vicinity in which the Simoom touched. Beyond three miles from shore the least depth found was seven fathoms. The party in the Vixen ran eighty miles in eounding out a stretch of twe!Ye miles coastwise with a breadth of six miles seaward. An intimation given in the log of tbe Simoom al' within the knowledge of the pilot then in cliargc in regard to the si11king- of a vessel some time ago in the vicinity in which the Simoom struck, leads Lieut. Comg. Phelps to the conclmiion that a wreck wae touched on. His examination was thorough, and thoug-h the obstacle was not hit in sounding the non-existence of the supposed shoal may he regarded as clearly made out. An extract from his report is given in Appendix No. 8. On his way to New York after making this examination, Lieut. Comg. Phelps started a line of soundings from a position eleven miles east of the "Falso cape" of the Chesapeake, intending to run along the coast in the direction of tho light-ship off Sandy Hook. The line waR kept across the entrance of the Chesapeake, but a little north of it the Vixen was set to the westward by the effect of a reeent gale on the eoast of Virginia, and the soundiugs were, in comiequence, interrupted. 'l'he vessel was shelteretl f'cir t!le time at the Delaware breakwater, and then resumed hydrographic duty, which has been mentioned in its proper place, under the head of :::;e.ction IL Hydrographic resurvPy ef Hclfteras inlet, N. C.-Early in October, Lieutenant Commanding T. S. Phelps, United States navy, with the Rteamer Vixen, was at Hatteras inlet for the purpose of making a hydrographic examination in n:Jg»trd to the changes which naturally take place there, and also with reference to the present capacity of the channel leading into Pamplico sound by that inlet. Tho tempestuou,,; weather encountered during that and the follow· ing month protracted the work intended, and postponed oxaminationR of other localities in the section included within the programme laid out for the party in the Vixen. Remarkable changes occurred while Lieutenant Commanding PhelpR remained in the vicinity of Hatteras inlet. A short base was laid out and measured on the spit at the south side of the inlet, and a chain of triangles extended across to the northward and eastward to recognized stations on the peninsula above Fort Hatteras and Fort Clarke. -(See Sketch No. 11.) The moRt important alteration of recent years occurred on the 2d of November, the force of the sea having cut quite through, eeparating the extremity of the peninsula on the north side of Hatteras inlet from the main body of it above, and leaving a water passage between Fort Clarke :rnd Fort Hatteras. The new shore-line depending on the triangulation reforred to was traced by Lieutenant Commanding Phelps and the soundings commenced when sufficient data had been supplied in that way. 'l'he hydrography was carried outside about two miles from the inlet, to include the locality of the bar buoy and inside of the sound rather further. To the northward the hydrography of Pamplico sound was extended as far as the triangulation had been made aud shore-line traced, or about two miles northward of Fort Hatteras. The sheet containing this work is now at the Coast Survey office. After leaving Hatteras inlet Lieutenant Commanding Phelp;; ran a line of soundings from Cape Ilatteras northward to Loggerhead inlet. The line crosses the \Virnble shoals. The steamer Vixen is now refitting for other duty afloat. At the request of General McClellan, Assistant Henry Mitchell has been sent to examine the physical causes which affect the contour of the shores in the vicinity of the military stations at Hatteras inlet. His report will include the suggestion of expedients for preventing, or at least retarding, the encroachment of the sea at particular points, if the results of his in-

vestigation of the currents and other hydrographic features of that localii}r should seem to render such designs at all practicable.

Completion of the preliminary triangulation of the coast of Georgia. A chain of secondary triangles ha;; now been determined, which joins the two Lases measured for the surveys of the Savannah and St. Mary's rivers. 4. Instructions for completing -1ie topographical survey between Port Royal sound and Savannah river, and for its prosecution on the tributaries of the sou11d. 5. Instructions for the plane-table survey of Wassaw sound, Ga., and for completing that of St. Oatharin~' s souml. C.

Tidal oh;;ervations. Office, work.-Tho drnwing has been completed, and the engraving in preliminary form of the chart of 01-1sabaw sound. Additions have been made to the drawing of the preliminary chart of Savannah river, and the engraving of that chart has been continued; the drawing of the hydrograpby of the rivers comprising the inland passage from St. Helena sound to Beaufort river, and additions to the chart of Port Royal and Broad river have been completed. The engraving of prelimiuary sea-coast chart No. 14, from Cape Ruman, S.

'.l'rianguW.timi and topography qf the coast of South Oarolina.-fostructions were issued, as usual, in the latter pa.rt of September, 1860, to A;;sistant C. P. Bolles and to his aid, Mr. 0. Hinrichs, to take up the coa;;t tria11gulation from its preseut limit at Little river, ("'ee Sketch No. 13,) and continue the work southward and westward as far aH practicable aloug the coast of South Carolina in the direction of Winyah Lay. The topography was to be prosecuted in connexion with the preliminary work, as had been done by the same party in the work bet.ween Little river and Cape Fear. Mr. Bolles, residing then at Smithville, N. C., judged, in consequence of the attitude taken by the authorities of the State of South Carolina, when he was ready to proceed, that it would be inexpedient to resume the field-work. Mr. Hinrichs was accordingly detached in January, and on the approach of the working season at the north was

as>:i1:rned to duty in Section I. On the 20th of April Mr. }folles resigned his position as .A.ssistant in the Coast Sun'ey. A small vessel, the instruments that ha<l been in the use of his party, aml other property belonging to the government, including plane-table sheet No. 72ii, and the sheets containing the topograpl1y executed by Mr. Hinrichs in the working season of 1859-'GO, are yet in his cu~tudy. Triangulation vcticeert Bea11fort, S. G., and Savannah, Ga.-In O<?tobcr, lSGO, Assistant C. 0. Boutelle wa,; instructerl to make arrangements for completing the main triangulation of the coast of South Carolina, betw0en \Vinyah bay and the Sav!lnnah river, by extending the work from Port Ro:ntl entrnnce southwar<l to the city of Savannah. Lieut. Wm. Craig, l.T. S. A., then on Goast Survey service, was <lirected to assit!t Mr. Boutelle in field-work, and }fr. C. H. Boyd _was as8igned as aid to the party. At the clm;e of the working season of 185~-' GO the sc110oner Petrel, then unfit for sea, was laid up at Charleston so ns to be conveniently near to the site of work for procuring the material and supplies needed b_y the triangu1ation party. Arrangements were complete for resuming work in November, 1860, when it was officiall_y stated from the treasury that the URual applications for funds, based on the appropriations, could not be met. What shortly came to pass was not then anticipated. The schooner Petrel, with her equipments, belonging to the Coast Survey when in charge of Mr. F. M. JoneR, of Charleston, wal'< sei'.iled by the authorities of South Carolina in December la;;t, aud tlie application which was promptly made for her release was without avail. The eteam-tender Fire Fly, a very small ve;,;;;el, which had proved of great service in the hydrography of the coast of South Carolina ancl Georgia, was seized at the same time, and is still held by her captor;;. She had been left in charge of a master's mate by Lieut. Comg. Fauntleroy after closing work in the spring of 18GO. The Petrel was in Ashley river, in care of Mr. Jones. who had entered into a formal contract with Assistant Boutelle in May, 1860, in rega1·d to the safe-keeping of the vessel. The field dut~- performed by the party of Assistant Boutelle has been stated in the first clrnpter of tl1i;; report. Lieut. Crnig was detached from duty in the Coast Survey on the 24th of April. Earl:- in November, 1861, the part;· of Mr. Boutelle, with the steamer Vixen and schooner Arago, accompanied tlie expedition of Commodore DuPont and Brigadier General Sherman to Port Royal sound. The regular work of the survey has been resumed, and additional parties assigned to make special topogTnph ical and hydrogrnphic surveys for the use of the military and naval forces which now oecupy that part of the coast of South Carolina. Appendix No. 31 inclucle8 Mr. Boutelle's statement in regard to the connexion of his party wit11 t11e naval operations of Flag-Officer DuPont, and also extracti' from official reports, in whid1 rEferencos are made to the co-operation of the Coa8t Survey. In addition to the two surveying schooners Arago and Caswell the steamer Bibb has been reassigned for service, and serit to Port Royal sound in charge of Mr. Charles French . .Assistant Boutelle has sent to the office the original records of the horizontal angles measured during the last surveying season, and descriptions of the stations occupied by hiti party in the triangulation 1Jetween St. Helena and Port Royal sounds. There are now four parties at work in this section under the general direction of Assistant Boutelle. The8o will be again referred to under the head of topography, in the present chapter. Triang1dation qf the <'Oa8t of Georg-ia.-The entire coast of the State of Georgia has been spanned by secondary triangulation. .A.t the opening of the surveying season Sub-Assistant F. P. Webber took up the work behind Cumberland i8land, and extended his triangulation to a junction with the completed survey of Fernandina harbor, going over a stretch of eight miles coastwise. The triangulation follows the inland passage between Cumberland island and the mainland of Georgia. Stations along the outside beach of the it1land were determined by

chaining, the measurements being repeated over distances making in the aggregate ele\-en miles and a half. The connexion has now lrnen made. through a syries of forty-six triangles, lletween the Sapelo and Tiger island bmies, both of which were meas1.1red by Lieutenant Evans, t:". S . .A. The length of the side adopted for connecting the two, (North Base, Point Peter,) as computed by Mr. \Vebber, is, >vhen referred to the 8apelo base 3577.27 metres. and from the base on 'fig-er island 35 77. 83 metres. A very good result for the latitude of station North base (Tiger island) was also found, the position computed from the triangulation between it and SaYannah being onl_v 1. "5 grea tcr tlian the latitude determined in the same way from the astronomical station at Fernandina. Mr. Webber used the ten-inch Gambe.'- theodolite, C. S. Ko.

A further cx:ten,;ion of the preliminary stJrYey of the coa,;t liy Sub-Assistant Webber will be mentioned in tlie next chapter. To11ograplty qf Port Royal sound, S. 0.-To provide for the completion of the plane-table work yet outstandint; between the upper part of Port Roral sound and Savannah river. a]l(l that of the tributaries to the sound itself', Mr. Cleveland Rockwell was instructed early in October, 1860, to resume the sun·ey with a party in tlie schooner Bailey. Being itt that time, and somewhat later, engaged in topographical dut.'' iu Section I, his preparations fur taking up duty op. the coast of South Carolina were not completed uutil flecember. Just Lefore this it had been announced from the treasury that no fonds could be had to meet the estimated expenditures under the appropriations. The schooner, in consequence, wa~ turned oYer to service in the party of Lieutenant Terrill, which had reached Section VI earlier in tltc H'a::;ou. Under the exigency that arose in April after her return from the Gulf of Mexico tbe vessel was transferred to the Navy Department. During l\fay, June, and July :Mr. Rockwell was closel.'' engaged on special field duty in Section III, reference to which has been made in the corresponding chapter of this report. The plane· table sheet containing his survey between Port Royal entrance and Savannah river entrance of the working season of 1859-'60 was inked early last spl'in~ aud i::; now at the Coast Survey oflice. Since the occupation of Port Royal s01md by the L nited States forces, three plane·table parties have been assigned for duty in the field and are now at work under the general direction of Assistant Boutelle. TheRe will· lie in charge severally of Suh-Assistant ,V. S. Edwards, :Mr. Rockwell, and Mr. C. H. Boyd. The assignment of a fourth party will be I"eforrcd to ulHler the next head. Topography <f T-Vassaw sound, Ga.-Sub-Assistant H. S. DuYal was instructed, under dato of September 24, 1860, to proceed with his party in the schooner Meredith, and after completing the plane-table survey of St. Catharine's sound, to take up and execute thl.l topogTaphy of Wassaw sound, carrying his survey, if practicable, to a junction wiil1 that of the Savannah river. Mr. J. D. Bradford was assigned to aid him in field duty. The repairs required in the vessel and other arrangements of tlw party having been completed, the .Meredith sailed and duly arrived at Savannah, but on learning at the treasury that

The topography of 'Yassaw sound in consequence was not resumed this season. It is now about to be taken up by Sub-As8istauL W. H. Dennis, whose previous employment has been stated under Sections I and Ill. Mr. Bradford was transferred to the party of Sub-Assititant Ferguson for service in Section YI. The schooner MerediLh, which had been intended for use in Wassaw sound, was employed by a party working in Section I. Hydrograpliy qf St. Catharine' 8 sound, Ga.-The execution of this work was set aside by the untoward circumstance officially made public from the treasury in November. 1860, that fiscal means could not be had mu.ler the appropriations, and upon which estimates had been based. :My instructions were issued before the close of September to Lieutenan.t Commanding C. :M. Fauntleroy, U.S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, and contemplated the completion of the hydrography of 8t. Catharine's sound and the taking up of work in Wassaw sound. The F<chooner Yarina and steam tender Fire Fly were intended for his service. The last·named vessel, however, which was too small to pass to and fro between N PW York and her working ground, bacl been left at Charleston b.Y Lieutenant Commanding Fauntleroy when he closed work in the previous spring. The Varina had been laid up at New York. On the 29th of December the Fire Fly, then in charge of a quartermaster of the hydrographic party, was seized by the State authorities of South Carolina and has not since been delivered. To replace her boiler, which was worn out, a new one had been provided at New York for the service of the present working season, and that on the turn of affairs was retained at that port ;vith the Bchooncr Varina. Lieutenant Comman<ling Fauntleroy was detached from duty on the Coast Snrvey by order of the Navy Department on the 1st of May. All the records connected with the hydrographic survey of Ossabaw sound, including som1diugs, angles, ancl tidal observations, were sent to the office by Lieutenant Commanding Fauntleroy in April last. Tho hydrographic sheet had been completed and sent in during the winter. · Hydruurapl1y cf .Altamal1a sound, Ga.-Tbe duty assigned to the party of Lieutenant Commanding J.P. Bankhead, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, by my instructions of September, 1860, inclu<led the completion of in-shore soundings abreast of St. Simon's island, and connecting witl1 the work which had been done in Doboy sound. In addition, the party in the schooner Crawford was to run ofT-shore lines and complete the off-&hore hydrography of the coast of South Carolina, developing in its course the curve of one hundred fathoms, and determining the ocean currents by experimental observations. Other duty waB assigned in Section VI, and the preliminaries for taking up work were commenced as usual. The usual allowance to this party had been set down from the appropriation, but when the vessel was ready to sail no funds could be had to meet the expenditures. She was accordingly retained at New York, and was in May transforn'd to the use of the revenue service. ' Lieutenant Commauding Bankhead was detached from duty on the Coast Survey by order of the Navy Department on tbe St.b of June. Tidal observation8.-Tltc record of observations from the self-registering tide-gauge at the Charleston custom-house, S. C., were received up to the 22d of April last from the observer, Mr. W. R. Herron, and the gauge w11s known to be in operation on the 4th of May. After that time, postal intercourse being suEpended, no information has been received in regard to the observations. As far as the returns have come to hand the register of observations has been quite satisfactory.

The field-work accomplished under my instructions, and portious of work rn provided for but not executed, will be referred to as followt': 1. In8tructions for continuing the air-line triangulation acro8s the Florida peninsnla from its preseut limit at Gainsville. It was expected that Lefore the dose of next season the chain of triangles leading from Fernandina harbor ·would have been connected ,,·ith the survey of Cedar Keys. 2. Triaugulation em bracing the inland passage between Fernandi1rn and St. John'" riYur entrance, and conuecting the bases used in those surveys. 3. Instruction~ for continuiug the triaugulatiou of the eastern coast of Florida, from Matanzas inlet southward towards Cape Canaven1l. 4. Triangulation of Indian river, above tl1e inlet, extended from Willis' s bay to t!Jc "Xarrows ;" and plane-table ;;:urvey made within the limits of the triangulation of lat-<t year wliieh emhrace!i the vicinity of Im1ian HiYer inlet al!(l the lower part of the ri\·er. 5. Triangulation im>illc of the Florida reef, reaching from Pie Kf'y we,_;twanl tci Heep Point, and northward to the Main. This work determines in position most of the key~ in tl1e lower part of Barnes' s sound. 6. Triangulation of the passage between Pine island and the western mai11 shore of tlie Florida peninsula. 'l'his work is supplementary to the preliminary survey of Charlotte harl1or, and furnishes points for completing the topography. 7. Topography completed between Diego plains and the head of Guano riYer, Fla., making the survey continuous between St. John's 1·i ver ell trance and St. Augustine harbor. 8. Plane·table survey of keys in the lower part of Barnes' s sonnd or Chatliam lm.1-, and supplementary topography in Charlotte harbor. 9. Instructions for the hydrographic survey of Charlotte harbor, for which ample provision had been made in the triangulation and topography. 10. Tidal observations. Officc-work.-Tbe engraving of coast map and chart No. 68, from Key Biscayne tu Carysfort reef, has been completed, and additions havo been made to th2 progress sketch of the section. Progress has been made in the drawing and engraviug of general coast chart No. X, Florida reefs, from Key Biscayne to Marquesas key; in the engraving of coast map and chart No. 71, from Newfound Harbor key to Boca Grande key; of St. Augustine liarbor; alld in the drawing of coast map and chart Ko. 58, from St.. Andrew's sound, Georgia, to St. Jolrn' s river, Fla. Air-line triangulation across Florida peninsula.-ln the expectation that this work would be nearly completed "'lvithin the present working season, instructions for its co11tinuaJJce were issued last fall to Captain M. L. Smith, U. S. Topographical Engineers. Lieut. R. G. Cole, U. S . .A., who had taken charge of the details in the previous season, was assigned to assist Captain Smith. Confidence was expressed by the several officers on duty on the eastern side of Floridn in regard to the improbability of interference with the operations of the survey up to a date beyond the opening of the working season, and hence arrangements for going on wen· made as usual. Soon after the beginning of the present year, however, the condition of public affairs was so changed as to render any outlay on the air-liue triangulation unach'isable, without a prospect for the return of completed angular measurements. ~one was therefore incurred in the way of opening and preparing lines of sight, as had been done in extending the work 7

from Fernandina to Gainsville. The work rests at the last named ,;tation, (Sketch No. 14,) liut cannot be made available for the purpo;;;e intended at the olltset until the chain of triangles has been extended to Cedar Keys. The lines are opened a few miles beyond Gainsville, and the distance between tho station which would have been occupied next in order and Cedar Keys is about fifty miles. The camp equipage and implements used by the field party "'ere stored liy Capt. Smith in the railroad depot at ·w aldo previous to his resignation 011 the 1st of April. Lieut. Cole sent in hiR resignation from the army on the 10th of January. Tricmg1dation of the eastern coast of Floricfo.-Starting from stations which harl been used in the completed surve;' of Cumberland sound, Sub-Al'sistant F. P. \:Yebber, \Yith a party in the schooner Hassler, extended the coast triangulation southward to a junction with the survey of St. .John's river entrance. This work measure;; coastwise about nineteen miles. lts exeC"ntion makes the secondary trianguhttion of the Atlantic coast continuous from Winyah bay, in So nth Carolina, to Matanzas inlet, on the eastern coast of Florida. Mr. \Yebber resumed work for the season on the 13th of December, choosing the line Martin's 1'slond-South base, (see Sketch No. 14,) and carried hiR triangulation through the inland passag·e behind Amelia and Little Talbot islandi'. The party wns employe<l in thi,; dnty and iu tlie determination of stations on the outside beach of Amelia island until the 9th of March. Two theodolites were used, the ten-inch Gambey, No. G3, and the six-inch Brunner theodolite, No. 52. Tbo connexion with the triangulation of St. Julm's river was made on the side of lwund Pond-Horse Shoe by a chain of tweIJty-,.;even trianµ;les. A difference of only 0. 11 metre was found on compari11g the two eomputed lengtlis of the sir.le, u:;ing in oue caBe t11e determinations of the St. John's river triangulation, and in the other t11e base at Cumberland sound and the angular measurements leading south from it. Towards the St. John's. the inland pasrmge being thero very narrow, triangles of only about a mile on tbe side could be had, and that length required cuttiug mid clearing for the use of the theodolite. The positions of points on the beach of Amelia island were determined with the chain, and twelve miles were thu~ run by the party. The triangulation executed by Sub-ARsistant Webber includes points for the plane-table surYf\Y and bydrography of Xassau sound. The general statistics of the triangulation between the St. Mary's and St. John's rivers are thus reported : Signals erecteJ .................... - . . . . . . . .

Two hundred and thirty-one objects 1nre used in observing, aud forty points in all determined in position. Mr. P. P. Dandridge, who aided Sub-Assistant Webber, Tesigned his plat.:e in the survey on the 2Cith of April. On ber return passag·e the schooner Has>"ler reached New York on the 30th of March. The duplicates of the records of field·work were completed befure the return of the party, and are now in the office. Jn referent:e to tho inland passage, between Cumberland sound and the St. John's, Mr. Webber says: "Ves~els drawing not over seven feet can get through as far as Kassau sound, but south of that part of the passage is left entirely dry at low water, and uo more than four feet can be carried through to the St. John's." Of the entrance to Nassau sound he remarks: ''Nassau bar seems to have seven or eight feet on it at 1ow water, but the channel is quite rwrrow."

Early in Novernber, and wlien eng-aged in completing his preparations for work, Lieutenant Gill met with a severe accident at Savannah, and was detained there until the middle of December. The change of circumstances wliich had meanwhile occurred at the treasury, as already mentioned, induced me to recall the party and defer the proi'<ecntion of the work on the eastern coast of Florida. Lieutenant Gill remained at Savannah, and early in February resigned. Lieutenant Greene was detached from Coast Survey serYice on the 24th of April by orders from tbe War Department. Sub-Assistant Huger sent in his resignation. to take effect on the 31st of :March. The field equipage which bad been in use "-hen t11e party was i1~ cl1arge uf Mr. Huger was stored nt the dmie of the previous working season at the barracks at St. Augustine. Early i11 Jauuary the tents were seized by tlie State authorities of Florida, aud are yet held, with the utensils that had been used hy the triangulation party. Triangulation and topogropli!f r!f Indian rh·cr, Fla.-As the best means for carrying on the survey of Indian river abon: Fort Capron, 8ub-Assistant Charles Ferguson. having shipped material:> in the schoo11er Peirce, constructecl a ffat-boat in Januar.1- la;;t, and near the end of that month took up the triangulation of the river. The work was carried to the Narrows. or about thirtee11 miles north of the· village of Fort Capron. Indian river in that part of its course averages about a mile in "·iclth. At all the stations observed on f'caffo]ds of co11sider· able height were required for the theodolite. Two on the outer beach were elevated about twenty-five feet. On the west bank of the river, ·which has a natural elevation of five to ~ix feet, the height of the scaffolds required "·as less. Six signals Jor topographical pnrpo><e1< were ><et at suitable points, anrl their positio11s de· tcrmined with the theodolite. In ad~litiou tu tlie work above Fort Capron, Mr. Ferguson occnpied a station about half a mile north of the old military post, (Fort Peirce,) and a second at Shoal Point. on the east side of the river. Both of these arc in connexion with the preliminar~- work done last year, and with a third point about three miles south of the inlet, determined in position approximately, completed the basis requio;ite for the plane-table survey of Indian river in the vicinity of the inlet.

The angles were measured with the six-inch Garnbey theodolite, C. S. No. Gti. All the records connected with the triangulation have been deposited in tlle office in Washington. The plane·table survey of the lower part of Indian river was executed by Mr. J. D. Ili-adford, under the general direction of Sub-Assistant Ferguson. It joim; the survey nf ludian River inlet made by Mr. Ferguson laRt year, and extending northward, embraces botli hauks of the river as far as the tria11gulation had then been carried. Mr. Bradford continued the topog· rnphy about two miles southward of the inlet, and mapped in all seveu mile~ in extent of the beach and peninsula, and the same extent of the we.stern shore of Indian river. Sketch No. 14 shows the position and course of India11 river.

The sheet executed by :Mr. Bradford ropre;:;cnts hn:nty-fivc miles of shore-lino and surface ddails withiu an area of nineteen square miles. In many plaeos the shores of the river were very difficult of access, the wat.er being quite shallow. The ad ,-ance of the survey of the shores, moreover, was retarded by a tangled undergrowth of palmetto and by exten,,;ivc marshes. Tbc completed topographical sheet of tl1is season is uow at the office. AtlYiccs iu regard to the excited state of public feeling made it expedient to withdraw the part.Y iu the sclwoner Peirce, and the vessel accordingly returned to New York at the end of February. Sul1-A>:sistant Ferguson reports that he found eight feet of water in the south channel at Indian River inlet. About ten miles north of the inlet Iildian river lessens in width very rapidly. At the '' .K arrowt<'' it if< only two to three hundred yards wide, and is blocked up by shoals and islands. The "Narrows" extend eight miles, and then the river widens again. l\Ir. Bradford resigned on the 31st of :March. Triangulation if "Florida keys and Main.-A.n advance bas been made by the party of Assistant G. A. Fairfield from the completed work in Barnes' s sound, arnl in connexion with it, by triangulation extended westward from Snipe Point, (see Sketch No. 15.) This work includes, al;.;o, points wl1ich determine the positions of several of the interior keys, an<l furnishes the means for developing rather more than ten miles of the main coast between Barnes' s sound and Cape Sable. The party was employed in this duty during· the month of January with the schooner Cas\vell. Assistant Fairfield was aided hy Mr. }foLnne Tilton in putting up siguals, aud abo i u the records of angles and computations. In the triangulation of this season Mr. Fairfield worked from a camp on Pie key, and had mnde full preparation for extending the work towards Cape Sable. ·while tho triangulation waR iu prog-ross the ves~el remained at anchor near Rr>driguez key, in charge of the sailingma,;ter, her draught uot admitting of her use nearer to tbe site of work. The anchorage being at nn exposed position outside of the reef, Mr. Fairfield was authorized to return to New York after consultation with government officers at Key 'Vest. He accordingly despatched tlie schooner on the 11th of }'ebruary, and laid her up on her arrival at New York.

Tl1e ar1gles \Vere measured with a ten·inch theodolite, Blunt, Ko. 91. It will he seen by n,fornnce to the progress sketch (No. 15) that a season of ordinary good weather would suffice to complete the triangulation along the main coast of the Florida peninsula, between the inner keyf' and Cape Sable. The record;;; of the triangulation of Chatham bay, original and duplicate, with descriptions of the signals, have been turned in a.t the office. .A.ssistant Fairfield has also completed and fumi,,;hecl his computation of the results for tho length of triangle sides. Triangulation qf Charlotte harbor, Florida.-The triangulation of Charlotte harbor has been essentially completed by Lieut. W. R. Terrill, U. S. A., assistant in tl1e Coast Survey. His party, with the schooner Bailey, resumed work on the 13th of December. Lieut. Terrill took up the triangulation at Punta Rasa, and laid out and measured a series of triangles rmrning from that station northward and eastward behind Pine island, (Sketch No. 14,) and forming a junction with points used in the triaugulation of the upper part of Charlotte harbor. 'l'hc length of the series is about fifteen miles. Lieut. Terrill was assisted in this service by

Sub-Assistant W. S. Edwards, whose intelligence and efficiency are warmly eommended in the report from the field. The plan laid out for the season's work of the party in the schooner Bailoy wa~ dl'signed to push the triangulation of the coast of Florida northward after completiu;::· tl1e angular m1,,1surements in Charlotte harbor. With this in view, Lieut. Terrill vi,;itcd Tampa lietwee11 tltc middle and latter part of January for lumber and other rcquii.;ites. and there fin;t learned tlie circumstances which, in their course, ended in tl1e withdrawal of the party a!ld the vessel from the western coast of Florida. Returning, however, from Tampa to Charlotte harbor, he continued work, and completed the triangulation of the harbor in the latter pltrt of Februar_". On the 4th of March he -was with his vessel and party at 'l'ortu~aR, a11d thccre ma<le preparation for the return voyage to New York. The vessel, with the iustrume11ts and equipage of tlic triangulation party, finally reached port on the 14th of April. after :1 long aml 1Joisterous passage.

Coast topography north qf St . .AuguBtine, Florida.-For continuing the plane-tahlc· \York on the coast of Florida, north of SL Augm;tine harbor, Sub-A~si&:tant F. W. Dorr despatcl1ed the schooner Dana from New York i11 the early part of November, and joined the party filwrtly after at the city of St. Augustine. Takin,g: the first favorable opportuuiry, tl:c V('sscl was moved up to Shell bluff, a point on the North river to which tlie tnpograpl1y liatl heen extemled in the work of last season. The plane-table survey of the lmnks of the .:\ortl1 aml Gua110 rivers was then resumed and pushed northward to Diego Plain~, where Mr. Durr' s sheet joins a suryey made by Sub-Assistant Meehan in 1858. This season's work include~ eight miles of coast line, seven miles of the course of Guam1 river, and over ten miles of the course of the North river, all in a northerly direction (Sketch No. H) from the limit reached last year, and completes the topography of the coast between St. .Tohu',.; river entrance arnl St. Augustine harboJI.

Otfice-work.-Progress has been made in the drawing of coast map and chart No. 81Gulf coast from C hassabowitzka river, Fla., to Cedar Keys; and in the engraving of important additions to the chart of the western part of St. George's Round. The drawing and engraving of the preliminary chart of Cedar Keys, (new edition;) of ERcambia and Santa Maria de Galvaez bays, (in preliminary form;) and the drawing of .Apalachicola bay, have been completed, and additio11s have been made to the progress sketch of the section. Longitude, by telegraph, at Pensacola, Fla.-Tbe chain of determinations of longitude at the principal ports and cities of the Atlantic and Gulf coast of the United States has been made complete by telegraphic observations at Pensacola, in connexion with Mobile. The longitude of the last·named point was determined in 1858, in connexion with a station at New Orleans. Assistant Geo. W. Dean having selected the requisite astronomical instruments and apparatus at the office and despatched them in charge of one of the aids of his party, proceeded to Pensacola near the end of November, 1860, and made the arrangements necessary .for the nse of the telegraph lines between that city and Mobile. An astronomical station was established and instruments set up for determining also the latitude and azimuth at Pensacola. With the courtesy whid1 has marked the whole progress of this work between Eastport, Me., and New Orleans, the telegraph lines were placed at Mr. Dean's disposal by the general managers, for use after 9 o'clock at night. Having made preliminary observations to ascertain the personal equation between the members of the party, Assistant Edward Goodfellow and R. H. Talcott, as aid, were assigned to duty at the Mobile end of the line. 1ifr. Dean, Sub-Assistant J. H. Toomer, and H. W. Bache, aid, remained at Pensacola. After a successful exchange of star and clock signals, the observers changed stations, making similar exchanges of signals. Forty-seven stars at Pensacola, and forty at Mobile were observed on and during three nights when clock signals. were exchanged-one hundred and seventy stars were observed at each station to ascertain the local time and instrumental corrections, exclusive of two hundred and sixteen observations recorded at Pensacola, and fifty-six observations on twenty circumpolar stars for determining the thread intervals of Transit C. S. No. 4. At Mobile one hundred and twenty observations were made on twenty-eight zenith and circumpolar stars for local time and thread values. On six of the ni!l;hts employed in the longitude work, in January and February, one hun· dred and niuety-six observations were made for personal equation. The usual meteorological journals were kept by the party at the two stations, and have been turned in with the original astronomical and other records.

Triangulation of St. Joseph's bay, (soufl1,) Fla.-Iu continuation of the prelimi1rnry work which has been extended along the western coast of the Florida peninrnla, from Cedar Keys l'lonthward, Snh-ARsistant G. II. Bag"·ell again took up the triangulation on the !itb of December, 1860, at North Anclote key. As intimated in an extract from his report of la,,t season, the coast south of that key and 80 on to Tampa entrance was found ea,,:y of access, affording natural facilities for 1mshing tlie work r<ipidly. The triangulatinn was extended (Sketch No. 16) qnite through St. Joseph's bay (south) anu through Clearwater harbor to McKay's Point. In the terminating quadrilateral, m< will be seen by the sketch, the triangulation is made to connect with the 8ite selected on Chai dee' 8 key by Mr. Bagwell, in I 859, for a base of verification. .Arrangements were made by l\fr. Bagwell to meet the intended measurement of the line early in February, Assistant F. H. Gerdes having been provided with the means an<l instructed for that duty. The circumstances, however, then existing in hi,, t<cr:tion of the work made it inexpedient to keep the appointment which had been settled between him and SubAssistant Bagwell, and in consequence tbe line has not yet been measured. At Cedar Keys, where he was to meet Mr. Gerdes, Sub-Assistant Bagwell, learniug that public property had been put in jeopardy of seizure in the neighboring section, reported to me accordingly, and having well-foundeJ fears for the safety of the schooner .Jo,,eph Henr.Y, tl1en in his charge, he hastened her departure from that port. The ves:;:el left. Cedar Keys on the 12th of February, and duly arrived at New York.

The eight-inch Wiirdemann theodolite, No. 86, 'vas used in measuring the horizontal angles. :Mr. 1\1. 0. Hering served as aid in the triangulation party . .Appeudix No. 27 contains remarks taken from the official report of l\lr. Bagwell, descriptive of the character of the coast of Florida in the vicinity of St. Joseph's bay, (south). Sub-Assistant Bagwell re;;igned l1is position on the survey on the 30th of April. All the records and field-notes pertaiuing to his triangulation between Cedar Keys and Tampa have been received from him. These include his field computation of results. Triungalcdionof St. Joseph's bay, (north,) Fla.-The party of Sub-Assistant S. C. :McCorkle was detailed at the outset of the surveying year for the purpose of extending the triangulation of the coast of Florida around Cape San Blas, (see Sketch Ko. 16,) and through St. Joseph's bay. The schooner Torrey, with tlie equipments of the party, reached her working ground on the 16th of December. :Mr. McCorkle commenced work immediately, and occupied in succession three stations to the eastward of the cape, completing at them the measurement of angles as the basis of the work, which was to be prolonged westward across the sudden turn of the coast and into St. Joseph's bay. A.ft er a general reconnaissance to determine tbe direction of the lines required, the termini of which on the shores of the bay could not be Reen, the schooner was moved into that body of water, and the party set to work in tracing and opening lines of sight through the woods. Three of these, as may be seen by the Rketch, converge at Inch Keith, a small island in the lower part of St. Joseph's bay. .A fourth, from a station east of Cape San Blas, opens on a signal which Mr. McCorkle set up on the western shore of the bay. Six lines in all were laid out, and four of them opened for ohserving. In this duty the party was occupied during the month of February. There being no disposition shown towards interference with his progress, Sub·Assi:;tant McCorkle proceeded with the field-work and erected six tripod signals for observing with the theodolite. Before taking up the angular measurements, however, it was found necessary to return to Apalachicola for provisions and water, in the early part of March, and he there found the public excitement such as to render it imprudent to detain the vessel longer in the section. The instruments and other public property in charge of Mr. l\fcCorkle were accordingly sent on board, and reached New York with the schooner on the 27th of :March. Tlie reconnaissance made by Sub-Assistant McCorkle furnishes a scheme for connecting the completed triangulations of St. George's sound and St. Andrew's bay. Two of the lines leading into St. Joseph's bay yet require to be opened for sight. One, leading from station Dead Oak to station Inch Keith, will need but little cutting; the other, between Ragged Point and the same station, will be difficult, but the opening is stated to be quite practicable. Mr. H. W. Longfellow aided in the field-work of this party. During the surveying season at the north Sub-Assistant McCorkle was employed in Section I. Triangulation in Pensacola bay and it8 dependencies, Fla.-At the usual period for resuming work in this section Assistant F. II. Gerdes proceeded to Pensacola, with a view of completing the preliminary survey and topography of the bay and its deprndencies. His first duty was, in co-operating with the longitude party, to connect the new astronomical station with the triangulation. For this purpose he occupied four stations and measured seven horizontal angles by two hundred and fifty-two observations. The station points were carefully marked.

In Santa Maria de Galvez bay three stations of the triangulation of last year were reoccupied, and the angular measurements at them completecL The triangulation of Blackwater bay was then resumed at Escribano Point, (Sketch No. 16,) and was extended northward to the town of Bagdad, completing the preliminary work on the eastern arm of Pensacola Lay. On its westeru arm (Escambia hay) a re.:;onnaissanc·e was mmle and signals erected for furnishing the data required to complete the plane-table survey. 'l'his work was prosecuted in December. Sub-Assistants J. G. Oltmanns and C. Feudall were attached to the party of Mr. Gerdes. The schooners James Ilall and Gerdes were used for transportation, aud at tl1e close of the year full preparation had been made for completing the plane-table survey for the :finished chart of Pensacola harbor and its dependencies. Early in January ~fr. Gerdes reported from Pensacola that the public excitement was such as to endanger the possession of the two vessels under his charge. They were accordingly removed to Passe a Loutre, but the assurance being no greater in regard to their safety there, both were despatched in the middle of that month for New York, and reached their destination in safety on the 3d of February, with the instruments and camp equipage of the party.

Topogmpky north and south of Bayport, Fla.-The plane-table surve.'- of the western coast of the Florida peninsula was resumed on the 1st of December at Raccoon Point by Suh-Assistant N. S. Finney, and was continued southwarJ to Round island signal, two miles below Bayport. Two sheets were worked on; one embracing seven miles of the coai;t nortl1 'md south, and the other, on a larger scale, tho to\vn of Bayport and its vicinity, aud the "' ekawatchee and Mud rivers. The positions of both are shown on Sketch No. 16. Tnmsportation for the party and implements useJ in the topography was furnished by Sub-Assistant Bagwell with the schooner Joseph Henry. In the early part of Februa,ry, while Mr. Finney was engaged in topographical duty with the prospect of a large return of work, as will he seen by the 8tati,;tics, the public property in his charge necessary for its continuance was demanded by a committee of a1·med i uhabitants of Bayport, in number about twenty. The tents and camp fixtures being under the protection of only Sub-Assistant Finney and his aid, Mr. L. L. :N'ichol:lon, were neces:mril.'- relinquished to the chairman of the committee, :Mr. C. T. Jenkins, whose receipt for the property is now on file in the Coast Survey office. :Mr. Finney had just previouely sent off his boats to the schooner Joseph Henry, thereby securing the instt umentR and a large part of the outfit intended for the remainder of the working season. A boat which could not be removed by the planetable party was left at Homasassa on the 15th of February, in the care of Hon. D. L. Yulee, a receipt for it being taken in the usual form.

Some incidental remarks in the report of 8ub-A,;sistant Finney, relating to the cmH;t and waters of the Florida peninsula in the neighborhood of Bayport, are given in A.ppendix No. 28. Topography qf St. George's and St. Vincent's sounds, Fla.-Tlie only work required to complete the plane-table survey of St. George's sound is a portion of the course of Crooked river and the neighboring part of St. James's island inside of tho shore of the sound. This duty would have been taken in hand at the approach of winter by Assistant G. D. ·wise, with a party in the schooner Howell Cobb, if funds had been available at the treasury. My instructions for the service were issued in September, 1860. It was intended also to push the planetalJle work westward from Indian Pass within the triangulation of this year by Sub-Assistant McCorkle. In May last the vessel was transferred to the Navy Department. During the spring and summer .Mr. Wise was actively engaged in the charge, transfer, and repairs of vessels at Baltimore and Philiuielpbia, and ;mbseqnently has been on special service by permission from the Treasury Department. In the course of the winter of 18GO-' 61 Mr. Wise inked and sent to the office two planetable sheets, containing his rnrvcy of the coast of Florida between Ocilla river and Ocklokonee bay. H.1fdrograpny qf St. George's sound, Fla.-The work intended to be assigned to the party of Lieut. Comg. ·r. S. Phelps, U. S. N., with the steamer Vixen, by my instructions of tbe autumn of 18(i0, was the completion of the hydrography of St. George's sound, by extending the inside work from Cat Point to Royal Bluff. The outside hydrogrnphy was to be executed between St. Mark's harbor and South west cape, and a screw-pile signal set on the Ocklokonce shoal. The execution of this pln.n of work in the present surveying year was prevented by the tfo~turhc<l fi::;cal relations of the government, to which allusion has been made in several instances in connexion with notices of work in other localities on the Atlantic and Gulf coast. Lieut. Oomg. Plielps was actively employed during the entire season, which, if circumstances liad permitted, would have been spent in completing the bydrography between St. ::\lark's and Apalachicola. The labors of the party in the steamer Vixen, and subsequently in the steamer Corwin, have been noticed under Sections I, ll, III, and IV, in this report. The sheet containing the soundings made last year in the eastern part of St. George's sound has been plotted and filed in the office. The hydrographic survey made by Lieut. Comg. Phelps in the dependencies of Pensacola bay during the working season of 18."i9-' 60 is represented by two sheets, 'vhich were plotted in the course of last winter. One of these contains the soundings made in Escambia bay, the other those made in Maria de Galvez bay and its dependencies. Tidcil obse1 vafi011.s.-The self-registering tide-gauge8, mentioned in my report of last year as having been in operation at St. Mark's and on St. Vincent's island, were taken up in the beginning of February last by Mr. A. C. Mitchell, after the completion of a year's series at each of the stations. My purpose was to have them set up at stations to t-he westward of }fouile, and for that purpo"-e the schooner Twilight, then in charge of Sub-Assistant Halter, was transferred to Mr. Mitchell. Though threatened with seizure at Apalachicola, the Twilight was repaired there in February, having met with an accident in the bay, and was finally permitted to sail with the tidal party. Mr. Maslin, who had made the observl'.tions at St. Vincent's islaud, and previously at Charlotte harbor, declined to serve at either of the new stations, and was discharged. Mr. P. H. Donegan, who had register~d the observations at St. Mark's, accompanied Mr. Mitchell to Section YIU. Mention will be made in its place under the next head of the means taken to procure results at new stations in the Gulf.

The plan laid out for continuing the work in this section will !Je stated in general terms under the following heads : 1. Instructions to complete the triangulation of l::;le au Breton sound, and for the plnnetable survey of the keys and islands of the sound. This work was intended to connect the triangulation of the Chandeleur islands with that of the Mississippi delta, at points near the head of the passes. 2. Triangulation commenced to determine points for the topographical survey of the Southwest Pass, (Mississippi delta.) Instructions were issued to the same party for the triangulation of Atchafalaya river. 3. Tidal observations. Office-work.-The drawing and engraving of the prdiminary chart of Passe a Loutre, (:ilfiesissippi delta,) and the engraving of coast map and chart No. 92, Gulf coast from Round island to Grande island, have been completed. The drawing haR been continued on coast map and chart No. 93, Lake Borgne to Lake Pontchartrain ; and additions have been made to the plate of lines of deep-sea soundings in the Gulf of Mexico, and progress sketch of the section. Triangulation and topography r/ I1;le au Breton sound, La.-In the expectation of completing within the present season the preliminary work !Jeh,·een ~fo!Jile entrance and the ~foisis sippi delta, Sub-Assistant R. E. Halter was instructed at the outset of the year to carry a series oft.riangles southward and westward from the Chandeleur islands to the delta, occupying as stations the range of i8lands lying on the south side of fale au Breton sound. The object alluded to will be understood by reference to Sketch No. 18. To meet the requirements of the party for transportation, the schooner Twilight was repaired and assigned to the charge of Mr. Ifolter. Under his general direction the plane-fa!Jie li'urvey was to be carried on by Mr. J. L. Tilghman, in conjunction with the preliminary work. The vesBel was repaired at Mouile, and early in January was ready to proceed to the intended site of work. An estimate had been made as usual, based on the appropriation, but no funds could be had to meet the expenditures. 'l'lie schooner was therefore transferred to Mr. A. C. .Mitchell in the latter part of January, and was used in visiting the tidal stations of the Gulf, as will be further explained under another head. Sub-Assistant Halter, on being recalled from Section VIII, was assigned to duty in Section I. Mr. Tilghman sent in his resignation on the 30th of April. Triangulation of Southwest Pas8, Mis8i8sippi'. della.-'l'he excitement of the public mind at Pensacola having induced Mr. Gerdes to remove his party as a memmre of precaution, the schooners James Hall and Gerdes, then under his charge, were tran,.,ferrcd to the anchorage at Passe a Loutre.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The present condition of the survey at the delta may be seen by reference to Sketch No. 18. Triarigul{_ilion of Atclw(olaya river, La.-For this work a party was organized under the charge of Assistant F. II. Gerdes. Sub-Assistant J. G. Oltmanns and Mr. G. U. Mayo were assigned to assist in the fiel<l-work. Full preparations were made by :Mr. Gerdes for work in thiB and in the adjoining eastern section at several localities, to which I have already referred. One of the two vessels assigned was intended for service in the Atchafalaya, the ouject being to carry a triaugulation from Berwyck over the bay of that uame and down the Atchafalaya river to a junction with the completed survey of Atchafalaya bay. The return of the parties before reaching the site of work west of the Mississippi delta has been stated under another head. Assistant Gerdes passed the working season at the north in active duty in Section I. Sub. Assistant Oltmanns was, on the return of the party, placed in charge of the magnetic station at Key Wost. Mr. :Mayo was dropped from the Coast Survey on the 6th of .July. Triangulation, topography, and hydrography.-A party provided with means for extending work in either bram:h of the survey has been assigned to duty in charge of Suh-Assistant R. E. Halter, who is now attached to the expedition of Commodore D. G. Farragut, for service in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Halter's general acquaintance with localities in the Gulf sections fits him well for the duty of pointing out where facilities exist to warrant naval and military operations, and where they are wanting. He is instructed to pu»h tlie regular work of the survey a1i opportunity offers, connecting, when practicable, with the work already done, and to make such special surveys as may be deemed essential for the public service by the military and naval commanders in the Gulf. It is intended at an early day to assign Assi:;tant F. H. Gerdes with additional force to duty in this section. Tidal ob.~ervaifons.-[11 accordance with the request and at the expense of the Mobile Harbor Commission, a self-registering tide-gauge was put in operation on the 20th of November, 1860, at Great Point Clear, iu MoLile bay. The records from it were received monthly at the Coast Survey office until the 1st of April, but not later, by reason of the sm;pension of postal intercourse with the Gulf States. At the Southwest Pass (Mississippi delta) tidal observations were discontinued on the 11th of February, advice having been received of the completion, a short time before, of a full year's series under the direction of Captain A. A. Humphreys, United States Topographical Engineers, who has kindly offered to put his entire record of that station at the disposal of the Coast Survey. My intention was to have the gauge transferred to a station on the coast of Texas, and with that view Mr. A. C. Mitchell was directed to call at the delta and take the instrument on board the schooner Twilight. This was done on the 4th of :March. Mr. Keyser, who had attended to the gauge while it was in operation, resigned his position as observer. The tide-gauge at Isle Derniere, set up last season, was intended to furnish a full year's observations, and was in good order in the beginning of March, when Mr. Mitchell visited the station. He lt:ft a supply of paper for the observer, Mr. H. Peter Wilson, from whom the records, up to the lst of April, have been received. The station being on an almost uninhabited island, and the neighboring mainland being also very sparsely settled, it was thought im· probable in May, when the record for March was received, that the observations would be interrupted, but as the mail communications had become deranged, the observer was directed to pack up and store the tide-gauge at the most convenient place in the vicinty of the statiou. N 0 intelligence in regard to his action has reached the office since the 7th of May, the schooner Twilight which had passed on westward in March, and 'vhich would have called at the close of the season on her return, having been seized at Aransas.

'l'he progress made by the parties Rent to this section, and the 1mrpose intended by instructions which have not yet been carried out, will be referred to as follows: 1. Triangulation extended from the completed survey of Galveston bay northward and eastward along the coa:>t of Texas to the High i8la11d8. 2. Instructions to extend the triangulation of the coast of Texas from Corpu;; Christi southward through Laguna llfodro. The triangulation is continuous between the limit8 mentioned in this and the preceding paragraph. 3. Plane-table work completing the topography of St. Charles's, Copano, a11d Aransas bap, and extending the survey of the coast of Texas to the upper part of Corpus Christi bay. 4. Tidal observations. Otfice-work.-The drawing and engraving of coaf>t map and chart No. 107, Gulf coast from Oyster bay to Matagorda bay; the engraving of coast map and chart No. lOG, Gulveston bay to Oyster bay; and the drawing of coast map and chart X o. 108, Matap:orda and Lavaca bays, aud of ge11eral coast chart No. XVI, Galveston bay to the Riu Grande, have l1een continued . .Additions to the progress sketch of the section have beeu made. Coast triangulation north and east qf Galveston, Texas.-The triangulation which was commenced at Galveston entrance in 1849 proceeded southward and westward alo11g the co11st, and at the date of my last annual report it had been pushed to the northern end of the Laguna Madre. Between the limits just given it has induded Galveston and Matagorda hays, E:<piritu Santo, San AntDnio, Aransas, and Corp1rn Christi bays, and the dependencies of each. Lieutenant George Bell, U. S. A., Assistant in the Coast Survey, was detailed to resume the coast triangulation nbove Bolivar Point, and took up that duty in the latter part of November, 1 SGO. He visited the stations necessary as points in a chain of triangles to extend towards the Sabine, and found the marks wliich had been set iu the ground at Stevenson's Point and at four other stations on the shores of East bay. Tliree of these positions he reoccupied, and also measured angles at four others with the ten-inch Blunt theodolite, Ko 92. Signals were set up at all of them, and going northward and eastward, at poiuts intermediate between them and the High islands, or within thirty-five miles of the mouth of tho Sabine. Tliis triangnlation extends along the low, wet prairie that skirts the cm1st (Sketch No. 19) above the head of East bay. The High islands, fifteen miles from the head of the bay, pre~ent elevations of from eighty to one hundred and fifty feet, and are probabl.'· the highest parts of the coast of Texas. With the exception thus made, the coast retains its marshy charauter all the way to the Sabine. Lieutenant Bell makes the following return of statistics: Signals erected .........·.. · ·. · .· · .· · · · ·. · · · · · · · Statio11s occupied· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · .Angles measured· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Number of observations· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·. · · .. ·.. · · · · · · · · · · · · . ·. . . . ·· ·· ·· ···· ···· · ··. · · · · · · · · · · · · .. ·. ·. 10 7 20 597

tbe present surveying soasou. The instruments and public property used by the party reached New York sufoly. Before the seizure of the United States revenue cutter Henry Dodge by citizens of Texas, that vessel bad been placed at the disposal of Lieutenant Bell, and her boats as;;isted matcri<illy in passing through the shallow bayous above the head of East bay. Earlier in the season a sloop of light. draught furnished by Lieutenant W. H. Stevens, late of the United States Engiueers, proved of great service in exam iuinµ; the shores of East bay. Lieutenant (now Captain) Bell reported in person at the Coast Survey office early in April, and on the 24th of that month was detached from duty in the survey. His report, extracts from which are given in Appendix No. 29, contains renrnrks on the character of the coast of Texas between the Sabine and Galveston entrance. The usmtl field record of angles and descriptions of the stations and signals have been furnished by Lieutenant Bell and filed with the field notes of the section. Triangidation Qf Laguna della Madre, Texas.·- The course intended by my instructions near the beginning of October, 1860, to As;;istant S. A. Gilbert would, in all probability, have carried the triangulation of the coaf't. of Texas nearly or quite to the Rio Gra11de boundary, but for circumstances that arose to disturb the public mind during the winter. Assistant Gilbert remained at Zanesville, Ohio, while the topography went forward, it being deemed best to wait the is8ue of events before pushing the triangulation, as that work was already a full sea~mu in advance of the plane-talile ~urvey. The progress made in topography will be stated fu1·ther on. Mr. Gilbert's camp fixtures and means used in transportation while employed in Corpus Christi bay iu the previous surveying seaRon had been stored at Corpus Christi. At his instance the former aid, Mr. Charles Hosmer, who served this season in tl1e plane-table party, procured a receipt from Mr. J. Benton Johnson, with whom the property was stored on the 24th of April, 18UO. It is supposed, for reasons which will be given presently, that tho articles heretofore used by the party of Assistant Gilbert were seized in the early part of May, 18Gl, by a committee of the citizens of Corpus Christi. No information respecting them has been received since that time. On the breaking out of hostilities in .April last, Assistant Gilbert accepted a military commission aud took the field, under the terms of leave of abRence, without pay from the Coast. Survey, which have been approved by the honornLle Secretary of the Treasury. In addition to his duties as lieutenant colonel of the 24.th Ohio regiment, as I am informed in a communication from Brigadier General J. J. Reynolds, (Appendix No. 3.~,) to whose division that regiment was attached, Mr. Gilbert t3Uperintended the erection of the defensive works at Cheat mountain, in Western 'Virginia, and planned and constructed others, exhibiting in all the skill of an accomplit>he<l :mgineer. He is now colonel of the 44Hi regiment of Ohio. 1'01iorrropliy <?f Aransas und Cuprrnu bay.~, T~xas.--The plane-table survey of the coast of Texas was resumed on the first of Dcccmher by Sub-Assistant W. S. Gilbert, and was continued m1til the end of April. Mr. Charlef<c Hosmer, heretofore attached to the triangulation party, atosisted in the field-work. Three sheets, slmwing the topography done by his party, have been forwarded to the oft.ice by :Mr. Gilbert. One of them contains the shore-line and details of the west 11ide of San Antonio bay below Webb's Point, and also the shores of the upper part of St. Charles's bay. The second sheet compriRes the lower part of Aransas bay, including part of St.. Joseph's island, and also the shores of the upper part of Corpus Christi bay. These two slwehi fill up the only intervals which remained unsurveycd at the beginning of the present year between the north end of Galveston bay aurl Aransa8 Pass. On his third plane· table sheet Mr. Gilbert traced the shore-line and topography of Copano bay and of Mission hay with 1he mouth of Aransa8 river. · 'The work done by this party brings the topographical <iurvey of the coast of Texas within one season of the triaugula.tion. Sketch No. 19 shows the advance made in both kinds of work.

Sub-AssiRtant Gilbert returned to Zanesville, Ohio, early in ~fay. Before leaving· Corpus Christi Mr. Gilbert packed the camp equipage which liad beell in his charge in this section, and placed the propert.r in the care of :Mr.·James \V. B,rrne, at Lamar, to 1Je held, as expressed in the receipt, subject to the order of Mr. Gilbert or other authorized rccei ver, and with the rniderstanding that the package" "·oul<l Le forwarded to Zanesville, Ohio. The camp fixtures, aud also the instruments which had Leen nRPd in the field-work, and which Mr. Gilbert expected to receive at the same time, are suppo;;ed to have been stupped at Corpu,; Christi, as mention to that effect was made in one of the newspaperc. of Texas in the month of .M:ay.* A sloop-boat, with Rpars, sails, and rigging, etc., comvlete, stored, under the same conditions, on the 19th of April, with Mr. James 1\1. Coffin, for ,;afekeeping, at La Salle, was, according to the newspaper account just referred to, seized by the same ''committee of safety'' which took posse;;siou uf the camp fixtures. Since the opening of the preRent :-;'ear the Yolnmes containing the origiual entries of soundingo made by the party of Lieutenant llo11cke]l(lorff, U. S. N., inf'ide of :Matagorda bay in the working season of 1859-' 60, and the register of' tidal observations made ut the same time, have heell received at the ofllce. Tidal ob8ervatiori.s.-A self-regi;;teriug tide-gauge wliich had been in u~e at St. :Mark's was removed in the spring, and on the 14th of :March waR set up at Calca;;ien eutrance, La., and left in charge of Mr. P. H. Donegan. The laRt letter received from him at the Coast Survey office was dated May 1, traIJsmitting the oli:;ervatiom; for April, and reporting the particulars of an interview with a committee appointed by reRident:< of the vicinity to inquire into his doings at the entrance of the river. After he had explained to them the nature of his work he was alluwed to continue; hut a;;: <·orre;;:pondence with the office in VI~ ashington, and the sending of his pa,r, became impracticable, he 'rn"' ofllcially direded to pack and store his gauge, and to return to the office as he best could. As he did not report in person, it was concluded that he found himsP.]f unable to leaYe the station. In August, however, :Mr. A. C. Mitchell, who had stationed all the tidal observen; ou the Gulf coast, ascertained that in the previous month Mr. Donegan was held as a prisoner of war at Lake Charles City, La. As a station observer, he was entirely alone, and without implements offensive or defensive. After the gauge had been fairly started at Calcasieu, Mr. Mitchell srtiled in t.he schooner Twilight, and set a similar one up at Aransas Pails. This wa;; done hy the> 16th of April. A few days after it became necessary to go to Corpus Christi, a draft seut to him from the office not being negotiable at Aransa,;;. While he was absent the schooner, with all the property on hoard of her, waB seized (on the 20th of April) by the deputy collector of the port of Aransas, Mr. V.l. H. Jones, and a body of nine armed men. Mr. Mitchell reached Wasliington in May, after considerable trouble, and was then assigned to duty in Section I. M:r. Donegan regained his liberty in the middle of November, and as soon as possible reported in person.at the office in Washington. He had been employed continuously for fifteeu months at tidal stations on the Gulf coast, when he was interrogated in the beginning of April at Calcasieu. The nature of his occupation being easily made clear to the inquirers, hi8 tidegauge was kept in operation until the 1 lt.h of July, with the general consent of the n:Hponsible residents. Mr. Donegan states that his arrest at the last-mentioned date, by orders from New

The computations nud duplicnticm of records kept pace with the field -work, and the yo]umes containing them aro now in tho archives of the office in Washington. In the early part of September, when Mr. Lawson reported in detail, tho triangulation had bcell completed aad tho topography was in progre,;s. Fourteen mile,; of ,;hore-liue had been trneed, and the party was making arrangements for sounding out the bay within the limits of' tht- triaugulation.-(See Sketch X o. 26.) 'l.'he general character of Kom; bay is described in the extracts taken from the report of Sub-Assistant Lawson, which will he found in Appendix No. 30. l\leteornlogical observations were carefully _registered while tlie party remained at Koos hay.

Ho U>'ctl for tho purpose theodolite No. 20, mounted on a block of wood instead of the tripod. The signal-pole at station Point Hanson, distant 849.5 metres, was observed on a,; a11 elougatiou mark. and ninety-five obf-<ervations were made on the star i3 Ursw .Minoris, near its WtJsteru elouµ;ation. The latitude of the astronomical station waR determined in the h1tter part of September, 1860, from two hundred aml seventy-two measures of the zenith distances of five stars when near the meridian. These observations were mndc on five nights, with the vertical circle C. S. No. 80. For local time twenty-nine observations were made on the sun with the Roxtant and artificial horizon on four days and one hundred ai1d eighty measures of zenith distance on ,.:even stars near the prime vertical on five night,;. All the records and notes connected with the astronomical work, and the register containing the meteorologic:al observatirms made at the same time, have been forwarded to the office. Snb-A.s:,;istant Law,;on was efficiently aided in Lluty at Gray':,; harbor by Mr. A. T. Mosmau. For the purpose of determining the differ8nce of longitude between Gray's harbor entrnuee and one of the points in the general scheme of triangulation in Washington Territory, ~fr. Law>'on tran!'forrcd hi,; party in the brig Fauntleroy, in the early part of October, to Port Towrnd1end, and there found the local time by one hundred and ninety-two measures of zenith di;;tancc with eight stars, using, atl before, t.lto vertical circle No. 80. The station ocoupied had hecn used by AssiKtant Davidson for astronomical purpose!" in 1852. After completing the olniervations at Port Towm1hcnd, Sub·ABsistant Lim«·mn set sail with the Fauntleroy for San Francisco, and reached that port on the 20th of November.

The report of Major Palmer (Appendix No. 12) is accompanied by Sllb-reports from the cliicfH of the offiee diYisions. Rlwwing the ddaib of ocrupation in each hrand1 of the offiC'e. I will here refer to them in hrief, using the n~portP wl1ich will he fonnd flt le11g·th in the Appendix. IIydrograpliic rli1·i.~io11.-Thi"' important hranel1 of the office remained in charge of OommmuhT S. S. LJ'e mid .Lieutenant Silas Bent, U. 8. N., until the outbreak of our national trouble>' in the mouth of ApriL when both resigned, the fir:;;t-named officer on the 23d and the latter on the 30th of" that mo11 th. Captain 0. P. Patterson, some years ago an officer of the United State,; nnsy, rmd well known by his intelligenL'e and sagacity as chief of one of the hydrographic parties of the Coast Survey, wa,.; assigned to duty at the head of the division on the 6th of ~fay. The principal oC'cupation under tlie direction of its chief haR been the examination and verification of original hydrogrnphiC' work, including the charts re1mlting from it; furnishing sailing directions: compilation of hydrographic sketches. and making projections for hydrographic pa1~ties. 1lir. Arthur Balbach executed the details of the work under the direction of Lieutenant Bent nntil the middle of .April, when he joiued the military serYice as a volunteer. Some time after the expiration of" his term of l:lervice, which wa8 followed by severe sickness, he rejoined the divil:lion, and hi>< intelligent services have since been given to hydrographic details, nuder the directi011 of Captain Patten<on. ]J_fr · .L. Harcher lia:; been m1gag-ed i11 making projections for hydrographic parties. He <tlso replottetl >'Orne preliminary hydrographic work, and lrnti assisted in the compilatio11 of hydrogrupbic Hketclies, Yerifications, and examinations of original sheets. I: nder the emergency 'vhic-h arose in April last the zeal and activity shown by Mr. Kardrnr aided much in procuring data of great importance for the public sen'ice . ·Vr. TV. B. 11Idlfortrie wal:l employed iu making projection" and drawiug views for hydrograpbi<" charts until the middle of :May, when he was assigned to duty connceted with the preparation of special hydrographic notes in another division of the office. Tidal dit:i.s·ion.-This division has been, as heretofore, under the charge of As8i,~tant L. F. Pourtalcs, whose reports in reference to coast stations and office-work will be found in the Appendix Kos. 10 and 12. In the course of the season the tidal data on record proved available in several emergencie1; for the public service, the calls for information being met without delay. The force of the division has been employed as follows: "Jfr. R. S. Avery lias revised and consolidated the reductions of the observatious at the permanent stations, and has deduced the daily inequality from the reduction of those in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. J. Downes has read off the sl1cets of the self-registering tide-gauges preparatory to plotting and decompoi:ling the curves, and has also made various reductions. 1'1essrs. J. R. ailliss, C. Balmain, L. M. Johnson, and L. L. Nicholson were temporarily attached to this division, and engaged in plotting, deeompoRitions, and reductions. M1·. J. W. Donn has had charge of the office, reading of the self-registering observations, of the correspondence with the observers, &c. M. Thomas and S. D. Pendleton have made the ordinary reductions of most of the permanent stations. lJir. Clilh~s resigued on the 4th of June, and lrlr. Johnson on the 19th of September. At the openiug of summer Mr. Ba/main was put in charge of the map room, and Mr. Niclwl~~1J11. assigned to field duty. Computing diri8i011.-Thiti division of the office has been in charge of its efficient chief, Assi.stant Charle8 A. Sclwtt. During three months and a half, when he was engaged on a hydrographic survey of the upper part of Ca01co bay, Mr. J. Ma.in was left in charge. Of some interesting and valuable contributions to science by Mr. Schott accounts will he found in the Appendix (Nos. 22, 23, 24, 25.) The number of computers in the diviRion is less than it was laEtt year, but the current wo1·k required for office use has been kept up. A detailed ritatemc11t of the work of each is given in Appendix No. 12. A11.~8tanf T. W. Wm·nm' has generally been engaged on the calculations of triangulations.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

office will be found in the report of Mr. George Mathiot, (Appendix No. 12,) who is in charge of the division. Mr. Mathiot has continued to improve the photographic process, and is now producing glass "negatives" twenty-four inches square. The application of the photograph, at first limited to the coast charts, scale 80 5c,- 0 , has been extended to embrace reductions for the larger Rcales, the draughtsman using the photograph as he would the lrnnd-reduced outline. Thus the meebanica.l process of '·hand redneing'' ha!' been almost entirely supen;ieded. The photograph has also been made useful in miscellaneous copying, and in facilitating· the publication of preliminary charts called for by sudden emergencies. The engraving of the outlines of two coast charts from the photographs has bee11 completed, leaving nothing in doubt as to the practicability of reducing and engraving a chart in detad1ed sections. The photographic reductions now embrace charts on the scales 20 ~ 00 , 30 ~ 0 0, 40 l 00, and ~lf0 , besides those of the scale of 80 fi oT>· to which the process was at first confined. 6 0 JJir. David Hinkle has assisted Mr. Mathiot in the division, and by promptness and intelligence haF met without delay the numerous special calls that have arisen through the necessity for copies of maps and charts in advance of the time that would have been required for either eugraving or lithographing. Lithographing divisi011.-Thiti division was organized during the past year, principally to assist in meeting the great demand for charts required for the public service, as also to afford tl1ti means of bringing out, under my immediate supervision, copies of a set of memoirs of the coast of the L nited States south of Delaware bay. The division eommenced operations under the charge of ProfesRor W. P. Trowbridge, AR· RiRtant in the Coast Survey, and, Rince his assignment in August last to other duty, has been continued under charge of Mr. W. L. Nicholson. U pwarcls of sixteen hundred impressions of charts and diagrams had been printed up to October 1, and seventy copies of each of ten memoirs of different parts of tho coa8t had been Htrnck off at that date. Since then two other memoirB have been prepared. At the date of the present report three hundred copies of these memoirs have been distributed to the naval and military commanders at the seat of government and along the coast. Jlli.~cellaneous division.-The officer in charge of this division, Lieut. N. H. 11:fcLean, U.S . .A., was relieved from duty on the survey in April last. .A88istant R. D. Cutts succeeded him in its direction until July, acceding with much promptness and zeal to my request to that effect in the interval of other important government service, since which time it has been continued in charge of .Assistant Edward Goodfelloio. More than twenty-one thousand copies of maps and charts of the Coast Survey have been distribub!d during the year ending November 1, over eight thousand of which have been sent to the naval observatory for the use of national vessels. Of the annual report of the superintendent, of 1859, four thousand copies have been distributed. Mr. C. Bcdmain has acted as clerk to the division since the resignation of Mr. Mayna.iHer in May. 1~Ir .·7. Rutherdak, aided by Mr. J. Barrett, has rendered efficient service as printer . .JJfr. JV·.lliertz, assisted by l'ifr. F. Han8on, has had charge of the folding room, and has pre· pared the paper required for field parties. Mr. J. Vierbuclten, master machinist, and Mr. A. Yeatman, master carpenter, have promptly met the numerous call8 made upon them by the office. The details of work done in the several branches of this division are stated in Appendix No. 12. On Captain C. P. PattBrBon, the hydrographic inspector, has devolved the dnty of making arrangements in regard to vessels fo;· the hydrographic work of the survey. This service,

C.oAST SuRVEY OFFICE, August 6, 1861. Sm: I have the honor to report that on the 15th of June I received, through the courtesy of Lieut. J. M. Gilliss, U. S. N., Superintendent of the National Observatory, a notice, communicated by the first officer of the American ship "Simoom," relative to the supposed discovery of a rock or shoal off the coast of Virginia. The position given by the log of the Simoom, which struck three times when within sight of Cape Henry, is seventeen to nineteen miles south of Cape Henry, and seven to eight miles off shore. The particulars are stated as fo!Jows: "The shoal or lump has 24 feet on it, as she struck aft between the seas, it being nearly high water, the sea moderate. Threw the lead as soon as possible; no bottom at 12 fathoms. It cannot be more than 150 feet across, as we cleared it in three seas. We named it the 'Simoom' shoal. Our pilot said that some years since a ship loaded with guano struck somewhere near 13

tho place and sunk, but as no shoal could be found, concluded it was false. Captain Smith says he has since learned that it occurred within the last six months." Lieut. Comg. Phelps, in the Coast Survey steamer Vixen, was requested to examine the ground in question, and reported the result on the 27th of July. The following are extracts from his report: "I have thoroughly explored the vicinity of the supposed Simoom shoal, on the coast of Virginia, and am perfectly satisfied that no such shoal exists in that locality." * * * * * * * * ''An area of twelve miles north and south by six miles east and west was carefully exam· ined, and the le~st water found beyond three miles from the shore was seven fathoms. If the Simoom was over three miles from shore when she struck, my belief is that she touched on a sunken vessel."

APPENDIX No. 9.
TIDE TABLES FOR THE USE OF NAVIGATORS, PREPARED FROM THE COAST SURVEY OBSERVATIONS, BY A. D. BACHE, SUPERINTENDENT.
[Furnished by e.uthority of the Treasury Department t.o E. e.nd G. W. Blunt, New York, and revised May, 1861.]

The following tables will enable navigators to ascertain the time and height of high and low water in some of the principal ports of the United States. The results are approximate, the observations being still in progress, but they may safely be used for practical purposes. The number of places of observation, and the time during which many of them have been made are steadily on the increase as the Coast Survey advances. The tides on the coast of the United States, on the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific, are of three different classes. Those of the Atlantic are of the most ordinary type, ebbing and flowing twice in twenty-four hours, and having but moderate differences in height between the two successive high waters or low waters, one occurring before noon, the other after noon. 'l'Lose of the Pacific coast also ebb and flow twice during twenty-four hours, but the morning and afternoon tides differ very considerably in height, so much so that at certain periods a rock which has three feet and a half water upon it at low tide may be awash on the next succeeding low water. The intervals, too, between successive high and successive low waters may be very unequal. The tides of ports in the Gulf of Mexico, west of Cape St. George, ebb and flow, as a rule, but once in twenty-four hours, or are single day tides. At particular parts of the month there are two small tides in the twenty-four hours. The rise and fall in all these ports is small. East of Cape St. George the rise and fall increases ; there are two tides, as a rule, during the twenty-four hours, and the daily inequality referred to in the Pacific tides is large. These peculiarities require a different way of treating the cases, and in some of them separate tables. I propose to enable the navigator to find, from the Nautical Almanac and the following tables, the time and height of high and low water at any date within the ordinary range of difference produced by winds and other variable circumstances. I will endeavor to divest the matter of unfamiliar technical expressions as far as practicable, though for shortness' sake,

some emch terms may be employed after defining them. Tho discussion of the Gulf tides has not been carried so far as to enable me to present the results in as definite a form as the others. As is well known, the interval between the time of the moon's crossing the meridian (moon's transit) and the time of high water at a given place is nearly constant; that is, this interval varies between moderate limits, which can be assigned. The interval at full and ohu.ngo of the moon is known as the establishment of the port, and is ordinarily marked on the charts. As it is not generally the average of the interval during a month's tides, it is a less convenient and less accurate quantity for the use of the navigation than the average interval which is used on the Coast Survey charts, and is sometimes called the "mean" or "corrected establishment."* The following table gives the principal tidal quantities for the different ports named in the first column, where they are arranged under specific heads. The third column of the table gives the mean interval, in hours and minutes, between the moon's transit and tho time of high water next after the transit; the fourth, the difference between the greatest and the least interval occurring in different parts of the month, (lunar.) A simple inspection of this column will show how important it is to determine these changes in many of the ports where they amount to more than half an hour, or to more than fifteen minutes from the average interval. The fifth, sixth, and seventh columns refer to the height of the tide. The fifth gives, in feet, the average rise and fall, or average difference between high and low water. The sixth gives the greatest difference commonly known as the rise and fall of spring tides; and the seventh the least difference known as the rise and fall of the neap tides. The average duration of the flood or rising tide is given in the eighth column; of the ebb or falling tide in the ninth ; and of the period during which the tide neither rises nor falls, or the "stand,'' in tho tenth. The duration of the flood is measured from the middle of the stand at low water to the middle of the stand at high water, so that the whole duration from one high water to the next, or from one low water to the next, should be given by the sum of the numbers in the eighth and ninth columns. At most of these places given in the list a mark of reference has been established for the height of the tide. I have omitted the description of these marks, (except in the following localities,) as of no particular interest in this connexion.
BENCH-MARKS.

Boston.-Tbe top of the wall or quay at the entrance of the dry dock in the Charlestown navy yard is fourteen feet -f-i/'-0 (or 14. 69 feet) above mean low water. t New York.-The lower edge of a straight line cut in a stone wall, at the head of a wooden wharf on Governor's island, is thirteen feet -f07TJ (or 13.97 feet) above mean low water. The letters U. S. C. S. are cut in the same stone. Ol,d Paint Comfort, Va.-A line cut in the wall of the light-house, one foot from the ground, on the southwest side, is eleven feet (11 feet) above mean low water. Oharkston, S. 0.-The outer and lower edge of embrasure of gun No. 3, at Castle Pinckney, is ten feet f-0~0 (10.13 feet) above mean low water.
Thill term was introduced by the Rev. Dr. Whewell, who has done so much foT the investigation of the laws of the tides. In consequence of alterations made to the wall during the year 1860, the coping is seven hundredths of a foot lower than formerly.

See remarks: on page ~2 and follO\\'ing.

Note.-The mean interval in column 3 has been increased by 12h. 26m., (half a mean lunar day,) for some of the ports in Delaware river and Chesapeake bay, so as to show the succession of times from the mouth. Therefore 12h. 26m. ought to be subtracted from the establishments which are greater than that quantity before using them. The foregoing Table I gives the means of determining, roughly, the time and height of high water at the several ports named. The hour of transit of the moon preceding the time of high water is to be taken from the Almanac, and the mean establishment being added the time of high water results. Thus : Example L-It is required to find the time of high wat~r at New York on November 5, 1854. The American Almanac gives Oh. Om. as the time of transit of the moon on that day. The mean interval for New York, from Table I, column 3, is Sh. 13m., which, as the transit was at Oh., is, roughly, the time of high water. The moon being full, the height is that. of spring tides of column 6, viz : 5.4 feet. If the soundings on the chart are reduced to low water spring tides, 5.4 feet are to be added to them to give the depth at high water. If tho soundings are reduced to mean low water, the rise and fall of mean tide8 being 1.1 foot less than for springs, the rise or increase of depth will be half of this, or 0.6 of a foot less than 5.4 feet, which is 4.8 feet, or nearly four feet ten inches. Example IL-Required the time of high water at Boston on January 23, 1851. From the .American .Almanac we find the time of the moon's southing or transit on that day 5k. I8m. a. m., and from Table I the mean interval at Boston dry dock is llh. 27m.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

103

We have then 571. 18m. time of transit. To wLich add 11 27 mean interval from Table I.
16 45 time of high water, or 4h. 45m. p. m. If tho Greenwich Nautical Almanac is used, add 2m. to the time of transit of Greenwich for every hour of west longitude and its proportional part for less than an hour. It will suffice to take the half hour which may be over any number of hours, as the correction for less than this would be less than one minute, and need not be taken into account. Thus, Boston is 4h. 44m. west of Greenwich. The correction to be applied to the time of transit of the moon is, for the four hours, eight minutes, and for the forty-four minutes, one minute. The time of transit on the date assumed in the preceding example is 17/z. 9m. of the 22d, or 5h. 9m. a. m. of the 23d, to which add nine minutes; the correction just found gives 5h. lSm., as before ascertained from the .American Almanac. In using the United States Nautical Almanac, in the astronomical part of which the transits of the moon are given for the meridian of Washington, the corrections required may, in this first approximation for the .Atlantic coast, be neglected. To find the time of the next following low water add, from 1'able I, the duration of ebb tide. This gives 4h. 45-m. p. m. time of high water. 6 13 duration of ebb tide from Table I.

10 58 p. m. By subtracting tho duration of flood tide we obtain the time of tho preceding low water, 10h. 32m. a. m., recollecting that 4li. 45m. p. m. is the same as 16h. 45m. reckoned from midnight. The height of this tide, corresponding to the transit of 5h., will bring it nearly to a neap tide, and the rise and fall obtained from column 7, Table I, is 8.5 feet. The next following high water may be had by adding to the time of low water the duration of flood from Table I. Thus: lOli. 58ni. p. m. time of low water January 23. 6 13 duration of flood from Table I. Sum

17 11 or 5h. llm. on January 24. Or, having found the time of high water, the time of the next following high water may

be found by adding the duration of flood and ebb together, and their sum to the time of high water found, thus : 6h. l3m. duration of ebb tide, from Table I. 6 13 duration of flood. Sum 12 4 26 45 duration of whole tide. p. m., .January 23, time of high water.

Sum 17 11 or Sh. llm. a. m., January 24, time of the next succeeding high water. Subtracting the same quantity will give the time of the preceding high water, thus: 4h. 45m. p. m., or 16h. 45m. from midnight, is the time of high water. 12 26 duration of flood and ebb tide. 4 19 a. m. of tho 23d for the preceding high water.

In these the variationR in the interval lwtween tlie moon'H tranRit. rmd high water are shown for some of the principal ports contained in Table I. These variations of int.ervafa depend upon the age of the moon, and, AS they go through their values in half a lunar month, are known as the half-monthly inequality of interval. The table extends from tho Oh. of transit, midnight of the calendar day, or full of the moon, to 11~ hours. The numbers for change of the moon correspond to those of Oh., and for 13 hours (or 1h. p. m. of the calendar day) to 1 hour, and so on up to 23 hours. The ports for which the numbers are given are designated by the heading of the columns. The mean interval, it will be seeu, does not occur at full ai\d chauge, but nearly two days afterwards, on the Atlantic coast. .A.t Key West it occurs more nearly at full and change, and at San Francisco still more nearly, The same remark applies to the heights; spring tides occur about two days after the full and change of the moon, and neaps two days after the first and last quarters. The use of this table of nearer approximation is quite as simple as that of Table I. Rule to find ihe time of high water.-Look in the Almanac for the time of moon's transit (or southing) for the date required. In the table corresponding to that time will be found the number to be added to the time of transit. Examp"le, IJI.-Required the time of high water at New York October 1, 1856. Using the United States Nautical ~Umanac, we find the time of moon's transit lh. 24m. astronomical reckoning, or lh. 24m. p. m. calendar time. From Table II we have, under the heading of New York, for lh. 30m. (the nearest number to llz. 24m. in the table) Sh. lOm. ·Thus, to lh. 24m., time of moon's transit, Add 8 10 interval found in Table III. The sum 9 34 p. m. is the time of high water on the 1st of October, 1856. If the sum of these numbers had exceeded twelve, the tide would have belonged to October 2, and we must have gone back to the transit of the day before and computed with it to obtain the tide of October 1. Rule to find the height qf high water.-Enter Table III, column 1, with the time of moon's transit. In the column headed with the name of the place, and marked A, will be found the rise and fall corresponding to the time of transit; in column B the number to be added to 14

Roundings on the chart, where the soundings are given for mean low vrnter i in column C the number to be added to charts of which the soundings are given for low water spring tides. ln the foregoi11g example, (III,) the time of transit being 1 and 2 hourn, we find from Table III the rise and foll of tides on the 1st of October, 1856, between 4. 9 and 4. 7; the number to be added to soundi11gs given for mean low water 4.5 feet, (culuurn B,) and for low -..vater spring tides (column 0) 4.9 feet. Having found the time of high water, that of low water may be obtained, nearly, by adding tlie duration of ebb from column 9, Table I. The time of the next prece·ding low water may be found by subtracting the duration of flood from column 8, Table I. The time of the next followi11g high water may be found by adding the duration of both flood and ebb; and of the next preceding high water by subtracting tlie same duration of the v. hole tide. Example IV.-To find the next high water following that of Example III. The duration of flood, column 8, Table I, for New York, is Gh. Om., and of ebb, from column 9, is Gh. 25m.; the sum is 12/i. 25m. To 9h. 34m. p. m., October 1, time of high water found, Add 12 25 duration of flood and ebb.

or 9h. 59ni. a. m. of October 2, the time of the next high water.

TIDES OF 'l'HE PACH'IC COAST AND OF PAR'r OF THE COAST OF FLOIUDA.

On the Pacific coast there are, as a general rule, one large and one small tide during the day, the height of the two successive high waters occurring one a. m. the other p. m. of the Emme twenty-four hourR, and the intervals from the next preceding transit of the moon are very different. The inequalities depend upon the moon's declination; they disappear near the time of the moon's declination being nothing, and are greate8t about the time of its being greatest. The inequalities for low water are not tho same as for high, though they disappear and have the greatest value at nearly the same times. The tideR of the southern part of Florida and of the western coast of that peninsula, as far as St. :Mark's, are of the same character. In Puget's sound the inequalities for the interval of high water and for tho height of low water follow this rule; but those for the interval of low water and height of high water disappear about one day before the moon's declination is greatest, and arc greatest about four or five days before the greate1:>t declination. When the moon's declination is north, the highest of the two tides of the twenty-four hours occurs at San Francisco about eleven and a half hours after the moon's southing, (transit;) and when the declination is south, the lowest of the two high tides occurs about that interval. The lowest 0f the two low waters of the day is one which follows next the highest high water. The nature of these tides will probably appear more plainly from the annexed diagrams. In them the height of the tide is set off at the side on a scale of feet, and the hours of the day are at the top. At 12 noon, for examplH, the tide-gauge marked 6.7 f~et. Joining all the heights observed in the twenty-four hours, we have a curve like that marked in the figure. The two high waters are a and c, the two low waters band d. If a is the high water which occurs about twelve hours after the transit of the moon, when the declination is south, the ebb a b is quite Rmall, and the high water, a, is much lower than the next high water, c. If the moon's declination is north, it is the large high water, a, of the second diagram which occurs next after the transit, and about twelve hours from it. At Key West the contrary obtains, diagram 1 applying when the moon's declination is north, and diagram 2 when south. Tables IV and V give the number to be added to the time of moon's transit to find the time of high water almost as readily as in the former case. They are of double entry, the time of transit being, as before, placed in the first column.

Tl1e number of days from tho da~r at which the moon had the grcatcRt declination i:; arranged at the top of the table. Entering the first column with the time of transit, and follo~\· ing the line 110rizo11tally until we come uu<le1- the column containing the days from the greatest declination, we find the uumber to bl' added to tho time of the tram;it to give the time of high water. If tho 7 moon's declination is south, Table IV is to be used; if north, i; Table V. :; Tables IV to IX, inclmive, have l1een recomputed, using 4 more complete data for the incqualitiet< above referred to, 3 and to those for San Francisco Rimilar tahles have been 2 added for San Diego, Astoria, Port Townshend, and Key 1 West, Fla. For the other places on tho Western Coast 0 given in Table I the following rules will give sufficiently close a1iproximations. s\I DIAGIUll >< To obtain the times of high or low wateT for San Pedro, 7 Cuyler' s harlior, and San Luis Obi8po, compute first the 6 5 time for San Diego by Tables IV, Y, or YIII; then add to 4 the time thus obtained 30 minutes to obtain the time for ~ San Luis Obispo, and snhtract 13 minutes for Cuyler' s z harbor. At San Pedrn the time of high or low water is sensibly the same as at San Diego. ° For :Monterey, South Farallone, Marc Island, Benicia, Ravenswood, and Bodega, compute first the time for San Francisco, then Fmbtract from the time thus obtained lh. 44m. for l\IonterC'y, 1h. 2Bm. for the South Farallone, and 49m. for Bodega; aud add 34m. for Mare Island, lh. 4m. for Benicia, and 30m. for Ravenswood. For Humboldt bay, Port Orford, and Neeah harbor, compute first the time foT Astoria, tlrnn subtract from it 40m. for Humboldt bay, lh. lGm. for Port Orford, and 9m. for Neeah harbor. For Steilacoom and Scmiabmoo bay, compute first the time for Port Townshend, and add to it 57m. for Steilacoom and lh. for Semiahmoo. The approximation will be only a rough one for Steilacoom. For the heights, Tables VI, YII, and IX for San Diego can be used without change for San Pedro, Cnyler's harbor, and San Luis Obispo. These tables for San Francisco are also applicable to Monterey, South Farallone, and Bodega. For Mare Island acld 1. 2 foot, for Benicia, 0.9 foot, and for Ravenswood, 2. 7 feet to the quantities for San Francisco. For Humboldt bay, Port Orford, and Neeah harbor, the tables for Astoria may he used, subtracting 1.7 foot for Humboldt bay, and 1.0 foot for Port Orford. For Neeah harbor the tables will give approximate resultf; without change. For Semiahmoo bay, add one foot to the quantities in the tables for Port Townshend. For Steilacoom, a rough approximation may be obtained by adding 4. 6 feet tc them. For the coast of Florida, compute the times of high or low water for Key Wel='t, and subtract lh. 7m. for Indian key, and add 26m. for Tortugas and U. 51m. for Egmont key, 3h. 45m. for Cedar Keys, and 4h. Sm. for St. Mark's. For the heights, add half a foot for Indian ke.\·, aml use the tables without change for Tortugas and Egmont key. For Cedar Keys and St. :Mark's the results could not be obtained with much accuracy in this way; special tables will be pre· pared for those places.

If we disregard the daily inequality, the column headed San FranciRc-o in Tah1e II "·ould give us, as in the examples on the Atlantic coast, the means of determi11ing the time of hig:h water. Example V.-Required the time of high ·water at Korth Beach, Sau Fr:rnci,.;co, Cal., ou the 7th of FeLruary, 1853. 1st. The time of the moon's transit at Greenwich, from the X autica1 Almanac, is 11h. 41m.; the longitude of Sa.11 Francisco Sh. 10m., requiring a correction of 1Gm. to thr' time of transit for San Francisco, which is thus found to be Uh. 57m. 2d. The moon's declination is south, and at the time of transit al1out two days after the greatest. Entering Table IV, we find 12h. (or Oh.) of transit, tho nearest number to llh. 57m. which the table gives ; and following the line horizontally, until we come to two days after the greatest declination, we find 1311. 14m. To 117'. 57m., time of transit of the moon, Fel·ruarr 7, San Francisco, add 137t. 14111., from column Oh., transit, and two days after greatest declination ; the sum, 25h. l lm., or lh. l lm., February 8, is the time of high water, corresponding to the transit which we took of February 7. If we desire the tide of Pebruary 7 we must go back to the moou' 8 transit of the 6th. The example was purposely assumed to show this case. 1 lh. Olm., time of transit February G, 1853. 13 31 number for 1 lh. transit, and one day from greatest declination.
Sum 24 32 time of high water Oh. 32m. a. m. February 7.

The 71£ight qf higli water.-The heigl1t of high water is obtained in a similar manner by the use of Table YI and Table YII, entering these in the same way with the time of transit and days from the greatest declination. Table YI i8 for south decliuation, and Table VII for north.

Example VL-In Example V, to obtain the height of tide on Fehnrnry 7, the declination being south, we enter Table VI for San Francisco, with Oh. of transit, and two days after greatest declination, and find that the tide will be 4. 5 feet a hove the mean of the lowe,;t low waters, or that 4. 5 feet are to be added to the i;:oundings of a chart reduced to the mea11 of the lowest low watern of each day. If the soundings of the chart are giYen for mean low water, then 1. 2 feet ought to be subtracted from the Tables YI and YII; thus, in this example, it would be 3.3 feet. The approximate time of the successive low and high waters of the day 'Yill be found hy adding the nnmhern in Table VIII to the time of the first high water already determined. The table gives the numbers for the different days from the greatest declination.

The days from the greatest declination are written in the first and last columns of the table. The second, third, and fourth columns refer to south declination, and fifth, sixth, and seventh to north, and the reverse for Key West. The second column gives the number which is to be added, according to the declination, to the time of high water, olitained by means of Tables IV and V, to give the next low water, wbich is the small low water, b, of diagram I. The third contains the numbers to be added to the same to give the second or large high water, c, of diagram I. The fourth, the numbers to be added to the same to give the second or largo low water, d, of diagram I. The succeeding columns give the numbers to be used in the same way for north declination to obtain the low water, b, (large,) of diagram II; the high water, c, (small,) and the low water, d, (small,) of the same diagram. The rise and fall of the same successive tides may be obtained by inspection from Table IX, in which the first column at the side contains the time of transit, and the successive columns the numbers corresponding to that time and to the number of days from greatest declination. 'fhe arrangement of this taLle is like that already given. 1'he numbers for the small ebb tide, ab, of diagram I, or c d, of diagram II, are first given; then those for small low and large high waters, b c, of diagram I, and de, of diagram II; next, the large ebb tide, c d, of diagram I, or ab, of diagram II; and lastly, from the large low water to the small high water, d e, of diagram I, or b c, of diagram II.

Example VII.-Tlrns, i11 Example VI, tlie high water of February 7th was found to he 3.3 feet ahovc mean low water. The declination being south, Diagram I applies, and this high water is the small oue. To obtain the fall of the next low water or small low water, we enter Table IX, for San Frauci;;co, with Oh. of moon's transit, and two days after the greatest declination in the first part of the tahlc, and find 1.9 foot, which will he the difference in the lieight of this high and low water. Ent.ering with the same transit and day in the second part, we find 3.0 feet, which is the rise of the large high above the small low water; the difference between 1.9 and 3. 0 or 1.1 foot is the difference of height of the two successive high waters. It is easy to see how, in this way, the soundings of a chart can be reduced to what tl1ey would be approximately at all the successive high and low waters.
TIDES OF THE GULF 01<' MEXICO.

On the coast of Florida, from Cape Florida around the peninsula t.o St. Mark's, the tides are of the ordinary kind, bnt with a daily inequality which, small at Cape Florida, goes on increasing as we proceed westward to Tortugas. From the 'fortugas to St. Mark's t.he daily

inequality is large and sensibly the same, giving the tides a great resemblance to those of the Pacific coui:;t, thong h the rise and fall j,; mud1 smaller. Ik~tween :-=.t. Mark's arnl St. G!!orge',.; island, A palncl1icola L'ntrancc, the tides elrn11ge tu the single day clas~, el1l 1ing a1Jtl Jlowiug lint once in thP t \\Tenty-four (lullar) hours. At St. George':< isLi.ml there are two tide~ a day, for three 01· four da_'I·:<, about, tlie tinw of the moon'R declination being zern. At other time,.; tl1cre i" hut one tide n day, with a long stand at high water of from ::;ix tn nine hour:'. From Cape St. Bia"' t<l a11d includi11g the month of the }fissif'sippi. the single day tides are very ref!,·ular, mid the small and irreµ·ul:1r douhle tides appear onl.1· for two or tliree days, (and frequently eveu not ai all,) about tlw time of zero decli11ation of tlH' moon. The stand at liigh and low "·ater j,.. comrmratiYely short, 8eldom exceeding an hour. To the weAt of the mouth of the Mil<sissippi tlie double tides reappear. At I~h· Dernierc they arc di;.tinct, though a little irregular for tbrcc or four <lays near the time of the moon·~ :i:ero declination. At all other times tlie single day type pre,·ail,-, the double tide,; modifying it., however, ill thl' shape of a long- stafJd of from six to ten hours at high water. This stand is slwdest at the ti me of tl1e moon's greatest de cl iuat ion, sometimes l1eing reduced to hut one hour. At Calcasit>u tl16 tides are distinctly douhle, bnt with a largP daily inequality. Tl1e rise and fall being snrnlL t11ey would often present to the ordinary observer thl' same appear· ance as at hle Dernierc. At Galveston the double tides are plainly i1erceptible, tliough small. for five or ;;:ix Jays at the time of the moon's zero declinatioll. At other times they present tlw ,.;ingle da~· type, with the peculiarity that, after standing at high water for a short time, tli(' water falls a i:;mall distance, and stand:'i again at that. height for ;;;everal hours, then continues to fall to low \rnter. SometimeR it falls very slowly for nine or ten hour:i following high water, and then requires a more rapid rate to low water. At Aransa:-; Pass and Brazos Santiago the 8ingle day tides prevai I. Small, irregu Jar, double tides are ouly perceived for two or three <fa)'S at, tlw moon',.; zero declination. At all other times then' i8 but one l1i<,d1 1\·ater in the day, witli a long stand of from six to nine honr:'i, durint:: which there are oft1rn small, irregnlar fiuctuations or a very slow fall. In tbe following table tlie mean rise aud foll of tide;; at the above statiom; are giveu. The highest high awl the lowest low water,.; occur when the greateRt declination of the moon happens at full or clmnge ; the least tide when tbe moou':-: decliuatiou is uotliing at tlie first or last. quarter.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

TO DETERMINE THE RISE AND FALL OF THE TIDES FOR ANY GIVEN TIME FROM HTGH OR LOW WATER.

It is RometimcR desirable to know how far tlte tide will ri"e i11 a given timP from low water, 01· fall in n given time from 11 igh water, or to approximate to the time which has elap8ed from low or high water, by k11owi11g the Ti"e aud fall of the tide iu the interval. If tbe proporti011 of tbe rise and fall iu a given tinw were the 8ame in the different ports, thil:' would eaRily be i;h.iwn in a single table, gi,·iug the proportional rise and fall, which, by referring· to Table I. showi11g the rise and fall of the tidP at tl1e port, would give the rise and fall, in feet and decirnals. The proportion, however, is not the same in different ports, nor in t11e same porti'I for tides of differnnt heights. The following table XI 8hows the relation between the heights above low water for each half hour for N e\v York and Old Point Comfort, and for spring aud neap tideR at caC'l1 place. Units express the total rise of high water above low water, and the figures opposite to each half hour devote the proportional fall of the tide from high water onward to low water. For example at New York, three hours after high water, a 8pring tide has fallen ;;;ix-tenths (sixty hundredths) of the whole fall. Suppose the whole ri,,;e and fall of that day to be 5.4 foot, (Table I;) then, three hours after hip;h water, the tide will have fallen 3.24 feet, or three feet three inche'4, nearly. Convcr>1ely, if we have obgerved tha.t a spring tide lrnR falle11 three feet three incl1eR, we may know that high water has pas.,,ed about three hourn.

TIDES IN COASTING.
By observing the time of high v.-atei· and low water along the coast we find the places at which they are the same. The map of co-tidal lines (Sketch No. 65, C. S. Rep., 1857) shows that it is high water nearly at the same hour all along the coast from Sandy Hook to Cape Canaveral ; of cour>1e not in bays and harbors and up the rivers, but on the outer coast. It is high water exactly at the same hour all along the line marked XII, seen on the chart, near Sandy Hook, and north and south of Hatteras, and, with small interruptions at Cape

Lookout and Cape Fear, all the way to near Cape Canaveral. Thi.; same lirw extend.; eastward to near Block island, and south of Nantucket, and then passes away from our eoast. At full and diauge of tl1e moon, along this line, (approximately,) it is high water at h,·el ve o'clock, Greenwich time, the local time of high water depending upon the longitude of the place ; or, to l'peak more correctly, in the average of a lunar month it is hig·h water Ro many hours after the time of the moon's passing the meridian of Greenwich. By these lines, called co-tidal lines, we can determine what tidal currents the navigators must expect to meet in coasting ; and for tl1is purpose we divide the ports of the com't into two sets, those south and those north of New York. The sailing lines of coat4tel's, bournl to southern port:; tliit-: i-;ide of tlie t4h-,tit;; of Florida, are marked upon tlic map, and altio of those bound through the sound,; to ea,.;tern port,.,, arnl onttiide to Halifax and European ports.

It follows, then, a,; a gem.:nil thing, from these two table,.;, that the coaster, in pasRing from Sandy Hook to tlw St. John's would have the tide,.; the same, within some fifteen minutes, as if he remained at Sa.ndy llook; so that leaving, for examplt=, at high water, he woulJ, accordiug to the elapsed time, have the ebb and flood alternating every six hourn and a quarter, nearly, as if he had remained near bandy Hook. As the flood tide sehi in geuerally to the northward and on shore, and the ebb to the 1:muthward and off shore, he would know by the time that elapsed from hil:l departure and the period of the tide at which he started what tidal currentt:' he might expect to meet as he passed along the coast. This, of course, is uot pe<.:nliar to Sandy Hook as a point of departure, but would be true for auy of the entrances given iu the table, taking care not to mi8take the time of tides within for that at the entrance. By referring to George W. Blunt, esq., I have obtained the tracks of sailing and steam vessels passing frow New York to ports to the south of it, as shown by the lines on the chart accompanying this paper. (See Sketch No. 65, 0. S. Rep., 1857.) Tracing these on the map of co-tidal lines, I have determined how the navigator would find the tides as he passes from

Thus, from Sandy Hook to Delaware bay, starting with 12 l10urs 5 minutes, off Barnegat there would be, at the same instant, 11 hours 57 minutes, and off Cape May 12 hours 10 minutefl, so that the navigator would have the same succession of tides whether he remained at Sandy Hook or passed onward to Delaware bay, or whether he came from Delaware bay to Sandy Hook. So from Sandy Hook to Charleston he will find, at the same instant, 12 hours 5 minutes, at Sandy Hook, 11 hours 57 minutes off Barnegat, 11 hours 45 minutes off Cape May, and so onward upon the parallels of latitude for the several points. Fm· all practical purposes, then, ef coasting, the succession of the tides, and, flj course, qf the tidal current.~ f!f .flood and ebb will be the 8ame as if the navigator remained stationary. Leaving at low water he will med the flood for 6 hours 15 minutes, and then the ebb for another 6 hours 15 minutes, and so on. It is the simplest of all rules that has thus come out of this investigation. That remarkable change of the temperature between the waters of the in-shore cold current and the warm waters of the Gulf Stream occurring in so short a distance that Lieutenant Bache called it the "cold wall," takes place at diBtances off the coast of from 170 to 29 miles, (see Table D,) between Sandy Hook and Cape Canaveral, measured, from the several points named in the table, at right angles to the direction of the course, or measured along the parallels of latitude of the pointB, at distances from 195 to 28 miles, between Assateague and Cape Canaveral, (Table D.) The points where the parallels north of .Assateague meet this division line have not been accurately determined.

In passing from New York to an eastern port the first great change in the tides and tidaJ currents is·between the East river and Long faland sound; the difference between Go\'ernor's island and Negro Point, on 'Vard's island, at the eastern entrance to Hell G:tte, is two hours and forty-five minutes. Between this point and Throg' s Point the chctnge is small. The mariner is now in the full tide of the sound, and between Throg' s Point and Fisher's island there is a difference of time of but two hours and twenty minutes, the greatest part of which is at the head of the sound and at its entrance, that is, near Throg' s Point and Fisher's islaud. From off New London to off Sand's Point the difference is but one hour and forty minutes, so that if the mariner, instead of remaining at Throg' s Point, passes onward to Fisher's island he would lose but half a tide in the whole passage. In other words, he would have the same succession of rise and fall, according to the time elapsed, whether stationary or passing onward, within two hours and a half, or less than half a tide. The tidal current lines show that even a less allowance is to be made for the change of current than for the change of tide ; the difference in the chai1ge of curren L lietween Throg' s Point and Fisher's island, along the middle of the sound, being of no practicable importance. Passing out of Long Island sound the tidal hours grow earlier, until off Block island that of Sandy Hook is again readied. The co-tidal line of s~mdy Hook and Block island being the same, it is the struggle of the same tide through New York bay and the narrow J<jast river, and obstructed Hell Gate, and through Fisher's island and Long faland sound, and to Throg' s Point. The tidal currents meet near Throg' s Point. 'fhe lower part of Narragansett bay has the co-tidal hour 12 hours, nearly. Buzzard's bay has nearly the same co-tidal hour, the tide wave reaching the shore at nearly the same time: all around the bay. It would be impossible to give in a small compass a minute account of the tides of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket sound. In general it may be said that as far as Holmes'" Hole and Wood's Hole they resemble those of Block Island sound, and afterwards those of Monomoy, at the eastern entrance ; but this generalization is unsatisfactory without more details than there is space here to give. In these sounds take place the remarkable change of between three and four hours, the greatest change of our coast, dislocating, as it were, the times of high water at places south and west and east and north of Nantucket. The whole of this clmnge take,; place between the eastern entrance of Nantucket sound and the western of 1fartha' s Vineyard, giving rise to quite a complex condition of both tides and currents, which it has occupied much time to unravel. The dominant co· tidal line of our coast, from Block island tu Cape Canaveral, is that of 12 hours of Greenwich time; that of our eastern coast, from Nantucket to Passamaquoddy, is, in general, 15 hours. Passing out of Nantucket sound coasters carry nearly the same co-tidal hour to Cape Cod, and thence vary their time about half an hour in passing to Boston, to Portsmouth, to Portland, or to Passamaquoddy. It has long been known that tlw tidal almanac for Boston might practically be used for eastern ports. Y cssels from New York to Halifax, and New York to Europe, which keep outside, and should keep well off tho Nantucket shoals, and off George's, as shown by the tract on the chart, vary their co-tidal hour but little, keeping between the lines of 12 and 11~ until quite well on their course, and beyoud Cape Sable. The same rule will apply to their c-ase as has been given for vessels between New York and a southern port.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 10.
llEPORT TO THE surERINTENDENT BY ASSISTANT L. F. POUHTALES, IN CHARGE OF THE FIELD AND OFFICE WOltK 11ELATING TO TIDAL OBSERVAT:mrn.

October 1, 1861. Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field and office work performed hy the tidal party under my charge during the past year: Fit:ld-work.-The permanent stations at which it is proposed to observe the tides for a long period of years, so as to have full data for the study of all their inequalities, were, at the Leginning of the year: Eastport, Boston, New York, Old Point Comfort, Charleston, Fort Clinch, on the Atlantic coast; and San Dicg0, San Francisco, and Astoria, on the Pacific coast; Tortugas and Pensacola, on the Gulf of ~foxico, were considered as partaking nearly of the character of permanent stationH. The station at Eastport was kept up by Mr. G. B. Vose, who had at the same time charge of the magnetic station at that place. In August last Mr. S. Walker was ordered to take charge of the station in place of Mr. Vose. At the Charleston dry dock the location of the tidfl·gauge has become inconvenient on account of its becoming silted up so much that the low water could not always be observed, and a new tide-gauge was therefore erected under the supervision of Assistant I-I. Mitchell in the building used for a self-registering tide-gauge by the Harbor Improvement Commission. At Governor's island the self-registering tide-gauge was kept in operation during tlie whole ·winter by using kerosene oil in the float tube to prevent freezing. The experiment was not perfectly successful, owing, probably, to some leakage in the tube. The corresponding oh;;,ervatiuns at Brooklyn were made as usual. During part of the summer a temporary staff was used, the observer's house having been taken down Ly the ferry company for repairs to their wharf. They have lately finished that work and put up on it a neat house for the tidegauge. At the Washington navy yard the tide-gauge was kept in operation until December 12, 1860, under the care of Mr. J. W. Donn, of this divi8ion. The gauge was then removed, being needed elsewhere. At Old Point Comfort the series was continued during the year, with the exception of some slight accidental interruptions. The observations at Charleston were received up to April 22. The gauge was still in operation on May 4, when the last letter was received from the observer. Postal intercourse with the southern States having then become interrupted, it became impossible to communicate with him. The tide-gauge at Fort Clinch remained under the charge of Mr. J · .A. Walker until September, 1860, when he resigned, leaving the station in charge of Mr. Meares, who, being inexperienced in the use of the instruments, was replaced on November 5 by Mr. A. M. Smith; the latter resigned and left the station on the first of April. A letter was then written to Mr. Walker to pack up the gauge and send it to New York, if possible, but no answer was received, postal intercourse having in the mean time become interrupted. From Tortugas good observations were received until May 1. The observer then advised the discontinuance of the observations on account of frequent interruptions caused by the concussions of the heavy ordnance fired for practice at the fort. There being no particular reasons for keeping up the observations, which were instituted chiefly for comparison with the other tidal stations in the Gulf of Mexico, which had all been interrupted, the observer was instructed to pack up and store away the instruments. A full year's observations having been obtained at St. Mark's and St. Vincent's islands,

(western entrance to Apalachicola,) Mr. A. C. :Mitchell was directed to take up the gauges and remove them to stations on the coast of Loui;.;iana and Texas, where it was hoped they would scarcely be molested by the sparse population inhabiti11g those parts. Mr. Mitchell performed that duty with the use of the schooner Twilight, turred over to him by Sub-Assistant H. E. Halter, in Mobile. No opposition was made to the removal by the inhabitants, although the schooner had to go into the harbor of Apalachicola for repairs, m;-ing to an accident to one of her masts. Mr. Donegan, the observer at St. Mark's, accompanied }fr. Mitchell. Mr. Maslin, from St. Vincent'8 i8laud, resigned and remained a.t Apalachicola. The schooner then proceeded to the Southwest Pass of the Mi;;sissippi, where she nrrived on the 4th of March to remove the gauge located there, it having been found superfluous to keep it up any longer, on account of a full year's self-registering obRervations, kindly placed at the disposal of the Coast Survey by Captain A. A. Humphreys, United States Topographical Engineers. The observer, Mr. C. Keyser, hatl previously resigned, havirig engaged in other occupation. He had beeu for a number of years a faithful tidal observer a.t numerous :-:ontl1orn stations, under the direction of the late G. Wurdemann. Mr. }fitchell then visited the tide-gauge at Last island, established in 18GO, and supplied the observer with paper; and, after stationing Mr. Donegan at Calcasieu entrance, proceeded to Aransas Pass, Texas, where he established a tide-gauge on the 16th of April. Having received a draft from the office, which he was unable to negotiate at Aransas, he was obliged to go to Corpus Christi, leaving the schooner for a day or two. On .Ap1·il 21 she was boarded by W. II. ,Jones, deputy collector, and a body of nine armed rebels, several of whom still held federal commissions in the custom-house, post office, or light-house establishment, who seized her and all the public property on board. Mr. Mitchell returned to Washington in :May, after a very trouLlcsome journey through the seceded States, and was aRsigned to duty in Section I. :Mr. Donegan wrote to the office on :May 1, transmitting his observations for April, and reporting that a committee of citizens had visited him and insisted upon reading his future correspondence. Ile was notified by the Superintendent, in consequence, to pack up and st.ore his instruments in tho safest place he could find, aud to make his way north in the best way ho could, as no money could be safely transmitted to him. A letter from him was received in August, stating that he was detained as a prisoner. The oLiserver at Last island was also notified to pack up his instruments, but nothiug more has been heard from him. He is a resident of the neighhorhood of his station. He had transmitted his observations up to April 1. At Great Point Clear, Mobile bay, a self-registering tide-gauge had been established by Mr. Mitchell on tho 20th of November, 1860, at the request of the Mobile harbor commissioners. The records were received until Ap1:il 1. Since that we have had 110 information about it. The tide-gauge at the Warrington navy yard had been taken down for repairs in the middle of November, and not set up again on account of Mr. Abert's absence. It was still there at the time of tho'seizure of the yard by the rebels. The tide-gauge at Cape San Lucas, Lower California, gave satisfactory results after the change mentioned in last year's report. The station was discontinued July 28. The three stations at San Diego, San Francisco, and Astoria, under the general supervision of Lieutenant G. H. Elliot, United States Engineers, have continued to give the most satisfactory results, as heretofore. Every tidal station is provided with a set of meteorological instruments, which are recorded three times a day.

Uffice·work.-The following persons are now attached to this division: IL S . .A.very, J. Downes, J. W. Donn, M. Thomas, and S. D. Pendleton. The following were temporarily attached to it during the year: J. H. Gilliss, Charles Balmain, L. M. Johnson, L. L. Nicholson, and P. P. Dandridge. The detail of dates of their reporting and detachment are already comprised in my report to the assistant in charge and need not be repeated here. Mr . .A very has been chiefly engaged in a thorough revision and consolidation of tho reductions of the different permanent stations, and in completing the tide tables of some of the temporary ones; also in making reductions of some of the stations in the Gulf of Mexico, and deducing the daily inequalities from them. He has besides performed miscellaneous other duties. The work of dccompoRing graphically the tidal curves of the stations in the Gulf of Mex· ico has been distributed among Messrs. Downes, Gilliss, Balmain, Johnson, and Nicholson, Mr. Downes reading off the original sheets, and the others plotting and decomposing them. Mr. Gilliss has introduced several ingenious and time-saving improvements in the mode of executing this work. Messrs. Johnson and Nicholson were detailed to make tidal observations at the Washington nrwy yard during tlrn time employed by Lieutenant Phelps in making a hydrographical survey of the Potomac river. Mr. Donn has had, as heretofore, the duty asRigned to him of examining the sheets of the self-registering tide-gauges, when received; of registering and reading them off; of acknowledging their receipt, and. pointing out defects to the observers; he has besides attended to other miscellaneous duties. M. Thomas and S. D. Pendleton have made the ordinary reductions of some of the permanent stations. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, L. F.

A PP END IX No. 11.
REPORT OF PROFESSOR W. P. TRO"\YBRJDGE, A"Sif:>TANT COAST SURVEY, WITH RESULTS OF EXPERHrEKT~ MADE WITH AN INSTRUMENT DEVH\ED BY HTM TO REGISTER DEPTHS IN SOUNDING, A::\!J DISIANCE AS A LOG AT SEA.

NEW YORK, January 25, 1862.
DEAR Sm: I respectfully beg leave to present, as a supplement to the report on my season's work in Narragansett bay, the encloi:;e<l results of experiments with the sounding apparatus and log which I have devised. These experiments were made from time to time during the season, and on referring to my note books they appear to give such satisfactory evidence of the accuracy and reliability of the inst.ru ment that I have thought it worth while to make a formal report upon the subject. The use of the revolving helix in sounding has never before given the very nice and accurate results which were expected, and aiil the errors of the instrument were large, Massey's indicator, in which this principle is applied, has heretofore been chiefly emplo;,ed in deep-sea soundings, where errors in determining depth might be tolerated. Having become satisfied that the faults of Massey's indicator were owing to the construction of that instrument noL being adapted to the nice work which it was expected to perform, I endeavored to combine the revolving helix with the registering wheels in such a manner as to allow the blades the fullest freedom of revolution, approaching as near as possible to absolute freedom of motion in the water, and at the same time making the '1.-ork which the blades have to perform in gi\·ing motion to the self-registering wheels the least possible. The form of the blades was also modified so as to present a greater surface to the water and to throw the points of action of the water as far from the axis of motion as possible, in order to give the blades the greater power to overcome the friction of the wheel work. The result of these considerations was the instrument which was used in these experiments. I believe it possessel:l great superiority in the following points: 1. Its delicacy or accuracy ~ombined with strength. 2. The great range in the magnitude of the dietances which may be accurately measured by it. It is quite as useful in sounding in three fathoms as in depths of t.hree hundred or even a thousand fathoms. 3. It may, without alteration, be used as a log or a current metre. As a log a di11tance of one hundred and fifty miles may be run bufore a complete cycle in the revolution of the wheels is accomplished. To use the instrument as a log it is only necessary to take off the lead and tow the register astern of the vesseL Thus it will be seen, by inspecting the appended results, that the apparatus records feet in small measurements (for depth,) and miles and fractions of miles in large measurements if used as a log. I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, W. P. TROWBRIDGE,

The foregoing soundings arc average resalts taken from a large number of experiments-. Experiments in 2:J fathoms show that the errors do not increase with the depth. Five casts in the same place gave a depth in revolutiOn between 90 and 90. 7, or a range of l foot onJy · Experiments with different weights at same depth gave nearly- identical results, showing that the number of revGlutions ilil proportional to deptb and not to velocity.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 12.
REPOltT OF :MAJOR w. n. PAL:\IER, c. s. TOPOGRAPIIICAL ENGINEEns, .ASSISrANT COAST SURVEY, IN CHAltGE OF 'flIE OFFICE, AND SU[l-REPORTS OF THE CHIEFS OF OFFICE DlYISIONS.

U. S. COAST SURVEY OFFICE, Washington, Nov. 1, 1861. DE.rn Sm: I have the lwnor to submit herewith, in conformity with your instructions, the annual reports of the chief:; of the divisions of this office, in which are given a minute detail of the muount of work accomplished during the year. It will be seen, from these reports, that the past year has not fallen behind those preceding in efficiency and economy. Tlrn diffusion of such knowledge as results from our various hydrographic, geodetic, a~tronomical, and magnetic operations, which in former years was freely accorded to all applicants has, by the exigencies of the times, been necessarily restricted, ancI in a groat degree confinecl to the u><e of the general government. Much valuable and important information of variom; kind,,; has been comm1micated to both the 'Var and t be Navy Departments. In connexion with this, the photographic art has lent its aid and produced numerous reduc· tions for facilitating the demands of the office. So great, in fact, were and still are the requisitions for charts and maps of the survey for both the War and Navy Departments, that it became 1iecossary to establish an additional division-the lithographic division-which was dune early in the spring, and was placed under the charge of Prof. W. P. Trowbridge. For a morn general view of this division, I would respectfully refer you to another portion of this report, where a more detailed account of its working is given. At the same time, some of the mo~t highly finishecl and important charts of the survey have been completed, and wore added to our former results. The final completion of these charts was much facilitated by means of photographic reduction8. The printing establishment has been taxed to its utmost capacity to impply the ordinary as well as the extraordinary demands alluded to above. I shall now refer to the different divisions of this office, in their order of precedence: Computing division.-This division, as heretofore, under the "charge of Assistant C . .A.. Sclwtt, has kept up the excellent organization for which it has been distinguished in former years. I woulJ desire to call the especial attention of the Superintendent to the laborious indu8try of the chief of this rlivi:;ion, as shown in the preparation of many important papers ·while still efficiently directing the labors of the other members of the division, and answering, as bas licen done, satisfactorily, all calls for information f1 om the field parties on the snrvey, as well as from many other quarters. Tidril division.-'fhe charge of this diYision has continued with Assistant L. F. Pourtales, who al,;o reports directly to the Superintendent on the progress of tl1e tidal reductions and discm;sions. Messrs. R. S. A. very, John Downes, and J. W. Donn have been employed as regular computers. Mr. C. Balmain was also 80 employed until May 4, when he was tranr1· forred to the miscellancom; division, as clerk to the map room. Othei· ernployes on the survey Jmve rendered aid to Mr. Pourtales during the int0rvals of their field duties, as will be seen from his report, hereto appended. Drawing divL~ion.-At the date of my last report this division was under the charge of First Lieut. Thomas Wilson, 5th infantry, U. S. A., who continued in that position until .April 24, wl10n he was relieved by .A.ssiistant H. l;. Whiting, who occupied the position until July 18, when .Assistant Thomas J. Lee was placed in clmrge. · In this division the force is two le~s than at the date of my last report; and the unusual number of calls for military information, and the preparation of drawings for the lithographers, have caused a very great interruption in the finished work of the di vision. Yet with the assistance afforded by photographic reductions the work continues in advance of the engraving.

TIIE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

The system adopted for the reduction of original field sheets remains unehanged, and the reductions by photography, for the finished maps, have been irnccessfully continued. The clerical duties of the division have been performed by ~Ir. \V. T. Brit;ht, who is reported by his chief as being very attentive and efficient. Engraving division.-First Li<mtenant J. R. Smead, second artillery, U.S. A., continued in charge of this division until April 24, when he was detached by orders from the ·war Department, and the charge has tempornrily continued with Mr. Edward "Wharton, assisted by .Mr. 0. C. Callan as clerk. It will be seen from this report that complete success has attended the engraving of reductions made by photography, and four of our most importaut charts on the "Fot 00 scale are now in hand, the material having been furnished b,Y this process. Electrotype and Pliotographic divisfon.-This division has continued under the charge f Mr. George Mathiot, assisted by Mr. D. Hinkle, who is again highly spoken of by Mr. Mathiot for his zeal and industry in prosecuting the work of photographic reductions of maps. Sixty plates have been electrotyped during the year-thirty-six in alto, and twenty-four in basso. Thirty-one glass ''positives," one hundred and twenty-four glass "negatives,'' and two hundred and seventy-two '' paper prints'' of original charts have been produced during the year. Arcltives and Library.-Six hundred volumes of original and duplicate records, one lmndred and e-eventy-five volumes and copies of computations and reductionR, and fifty-two original topographical and hydrographical sheets have been added to the archives of' the RUrYC\\" dn,ring the past year. Eighty-one volumes have been purchased for the library, and seventy-eight added by presentation during the same period. 'l'he attention of the Superintendent is again called to the limited space available for the preservation of the archives. A large amount of the deposits of the fire-proof building Lave been removed to another place of deposit in consequence of the want of room, and are now placed in a building some distance from that occupied by the librarian, and not fire-proof in its corlStruction. Miscellaneous division.-ThiR division consists of the printing office and map room, and is also intrusted with the distribution of the annual report of the Superintendent. It was under the charge of First Lieutenant N. H. McLean, second infantry, U. S. A., at the date of my last report, who was detached by order of the Secretary of War, April 24, 1861. It is now in charge of Assistant Edward Goodfellow, who succeeded Assistant R. D. Cutts, ,July 1, 1861. From the imbjoined report of that division it will be seen that seventeen thousand five hundred and ninety-one impressions from plates of charts and sketches have been printed; t11irteen thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven copies of maps, charts, and sketches, aml four thousand nine hundred antl forty three copies of the report of the Superintendent for the years 1851 to 1859, have been distrilrnted since the date of my last report. Lithographic division.-This division was organized in the month of ~fay last, in order to aid the regular copper-plate printing department in supplying, speedily, cLartR for the great demand made upon the office by the existing exigencies of the naval service, and also to afford the means of printing (under due supervision) a set of descriptive memoirs aud sailing directions for the coast. for the use of the naval and military commanders. The division was under the charge of Professor W. P. Trowbridge, assistant in the Coast Survey, until his assignment to duty in the field in August last; since which time the division has been in charge of Mr. W. L. Nicholson, from whose report, subjoined, it will be seen that twenty-two charts and diagrams have been transferred to stone, and also the sheets of ten memoirs of the coast; and that eleven hundred and sixty-eigl1t impressioIH3 of charts, four hundred and sixty-four impressions of diagrams, and seven hundred copies of memoin1 have been printed.

REPORT OF THE SUPERIXTENDENT OF

Carpentry.-'l'he charge of the carpenter's shop remains with Mr..A. Yeatman, who is assisted by two workmen. The usual satisfaction lrns been given in the performance of the work of this shop. There have been made during the year various stands and cases for instruments, books, maps, and copper plates, drawing and plane-table boards, implements for the photographic purposes, packing boxes for instruments, patterns for castings, wood work for a new self-registering tide-gauge, the necessary repairs to instruments and Coast Survey buildings, and, in addition, a large amount of miscellaneous work. Instrument slwp.-The force of this shop continues the same as last year, consisting of Mr. J. Yicrbuchen, master instrument maker, five workmen, and one apprentice. During the year 5 geodetic, 5 astronomical, 1 magnetic, 62 hydrographic, 23 drawing, 57 engraving, and 31 topographical instruments have been made, and 47 geodetic, 5 astronomical, 4 magnetic, 58 hydrographic, 21 drawing, 2 engTaving, and 78 topographical instruments have been repaired, in addition to a variety of miscellaneous work for the use of the office and parties in the field. I would express my acknowledgments to Captain C. P. Patterson, who succeeded Com· mander S. S. Lee in charge of the hydrographic division ; to Professor W. P. Trowbridge, Assistant in the Coast Survey, and in charge of the lithogrnphic division; to Joseph Saxton, assistant in weights aud measures; and Samuel Hein, e-sq., general disbursing agent, for their cheerful co-operation in every duty in which I have been associated with them in this office. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, W. R. P.ALMER, Mafor Topographical Engineers, Asst. 0. S., in charge qf office. Prof. A. D. BACHE, Superintendent Un·iled State.s Coast Survey.

Report qf Assi.stant Charles A. Schott, in charge qf tlie Oornputing Division.
COAST SURVEY OFFICE, October 31, 1861. The usual annual report on the work done by the several computers for the year ending October 1, 1861, is herewith respectfully submitted. With the exception of a reduction in the personnel of the division, no change has been made in the general organization as compared with previous years. Under the present circumstances the reduced force of the computers is yet sufficient to keep up with the current field-work. Mr. W. D. Starke was sick during Oc· tober, and resigned, at the expiration of his leave of absence, on February 1, 1861. Mr. B. Il. Todd resigned on the 11th of May, 1861, and Mr. J. H. Patton on the 22d of the same month. Mr. J. E. Dow was appointed copyist October 30, 1860, and on the resignation of Mr. Patton attended to the clerical duty of the division. Sub-Assistant C. Fendall was temporarily attached to the diviRion for special reduction of my solar-spot observations, from October 1, 1860, to November 16, and again from l!'ebruary 11 to March 11, 1861. Assistant A. S. Wadsworth was also engaged during last winter for a time in these computatiorni. Owing to the exigencies of the times the duty of a hydrographic survey of Casco bay, Me., was assigned to me by the Superintendent, on which operation I was engaged for three months and a half, during which interval (from July 8 to October 30) Mr. Main was acting in charge of the division, as he had done in preceding years on similar occasions. During the fiscal year one hundred and twenty reports have been submitted, principally on the results reached by the computers and on the examination of field records. Among other papers, I have discu.ssed the secular change of the magnetic intensity, horizontal and total, for the coast of the United States; made a new discussion of the magnetic declinations for the epoch 1860. 0 in Sections III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX, for which isogonic lines were constructed ; discus11ed and constructed the co-tidal lines and currents of Chesapeake bay and rivers. With the assistance of Mesiilrs. Patton and Dow the duplicate

CoAST SURVEY OFFICE, October 1, 1861. In accordance with the regulations of the office, I beg leave to submit the following report of the operations of this division for the year ending October 1, 1861 : The division was in charge of Lieut. Thos. Wilson, U. S . .A.., from the date of last report to April 24, and in charge of Assistant Henry L. Whiting from that date to July 18, and of myself since July 18. Mr. W. T. Bright has been most attentive and efficient as clerk of the division since July 1. There has been no change during the year in the system adopted for the reduction of the original field-eheets. Reductions by photography for the finished maps have been successfully continued. The number of plane-table sheets of which generalized tracings have been made during the year is fifty-two. Of these forty-three have been photographed on the reduced scale. For harbor charts ten tracings of plane-table sheets have been made, viz: three for the

Report q( J,Ir. Edward Wha1'ion, acting in charge qf Engraving Division.
U. S. COAST SURVEY OFFICE, Octobe,r 31, 1861. I have the honor to present the annual report of the operations of this division duri11g the year ending October 31, 1861. This division remained under the charge of Lieutenant J. R. Smead, U. S. A., from the date of the last annual report until April 24, when he was relieved from duty here by the War Department. Since that date the division remained under my eharge, and I have been very materially assisted by Mr. C. C. Callan as clerk to the division, and whose Yaluable services it gives me pleasure to acknowledge. The engraving upon copper, from reductions by photography, has been attended with complete succeRs, the engravers, in each instance, proving the entire practicability of engrav· ing from these reductions with as much facility as from hand reductions; and there are now four charts of the most important localities on our coast, of the 1f1'1ivo series, in process of engraving. A detailed account of these reductions, both as to scale and the method of representing the various features of the country, will be found in the report of last year. The engraving force at present consists of twenty-three eugraven; of various degrees of skill. A list is given below with the grade of each engraver and the amount of work accomplished by each during the year. The engmving of the following finished maps and charts has

Report qf .Mr. George Jlathiot, in charge

ef the

Electrotype and Photographic Division.

COAST SURVEY 0FF1CE, September 30, 1861. In accordance with the established usage of the office, I rcspectfuUy present the following annual report of the opern tions of this division: Since the date of my last report (September 17, 1860) we have made sixty electrotypes of the engraved plates of the charts of tlie survey. Of this number thirty-six were "altos,"

THE UNITED ST.A.TES CO.A.ST SURVEY.

161

or reverses of the engraved plates, and twenty-four ·were ''bassos,'' or duplicates of the engraved plates, made from the ''altos.'' I append a table of the engraved plates to which the process was applied. The reduction of the original sheets of the survey by photography has continued in successful use during the year, and the application of photography has been extended to the copying of drawings and important tables, letters, and maps not produced in the office. Hy the process we have made thirty-one glass '' positivef'." and one hundred and twenty-four glass "negatives," and two hundred and seventy-t"·o paper prints. Attention has been paid to the improvement of the photographic process, and as a result of thef'le efforts I arn now enabled to announce that we are successfully producing plates hYo feet square. During the year I have been assisted by ~Ir. D. Hinkle, and again commend him for the performance of every duty.

Co.A.ST SunvEY OFFICE, Washington, October 1, 1861. I have to present herewith the annual report of the Miscellaneous Division, consisting of the printing oflice, map room, and office for distribution of maps"and reports. This division has been under my general supervision since the 1st of July, when Assistant R. D. Cutts left the office. The records have been kept by Mr. Charles Balmain, who suc. ceeded Mr. W. M. Maynadier as clerk to the division early in May. Much more than ordinary diligence has been shown, and extra labor willingly performed, by the employes in order to meet the largely increased demands of the War. and Navy Depai-tmcnts during the past spring and summer for the maps and charts of the survey.

EXPETIH'IENTS TO JJETEH!IIXE THE HELATIYE SHRIXKAGE AND E.."l:PANSION OF PARCHMENT PAPEH AND
DACKIW AXTJQl'AltIAN PAPER.-(SKETcn No. 31.J

DRAWING DIVISION, June 26, 1861. Sm : I was directed by Lieut. '\Vilson, in pursuance of the Superintendent's orders in April last, to test the relative shrinkage and expansion of two samples of parchment paper and bacl;ed antiquarian paper. I prepared the lunge:;t possible strips in cross directions, i inch wide, 81~ illclJOs being the length obtained. These had equal weights suspended and were attached at equal di:;brnces from tl1e point of suspension to indices, the recQrding arm of which wa,,; 10 times the length of the one attached to the paper. By this means a very slight change in the paper wal'. apparent on the scale. The result was df;cidedly in favor of the backed paper, as will appear from the observations aud diagram accompanying. Yours, very ret=:poctfully,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT 01<'

APPENDIX No. 16.
REPORT l'PON THE DETEHMIN ATION OF THE LONGITUDE OF AMEHICA AND EUROPE FROM 'l'HE SOLAlt ECLIPSE OF JULY 28, 1851. RY PROFESSOR BENJAMIN PEITICE, LL.D., &c., &c., &c.

CAMBRIDGE, May 31, 1861. Sm: The solar eclipse of July 28, 1851, was pre-eminently adapted to the determination of the longitude of America and Europe: For this object it surpasses any other celestial phenomenon which is yet known to science either in the past or the future, and was observed under aR favorable conditions upon each side of the ocean as can reasonably be desired. The beginning and the e!ld were both repeatedly obRerved upon either continent by skilful observers, and the computation deserves careful and thorough elaboration. Criticism must first be directed to the observations themselves.
OBSERY ATIONS OF THE TOT.AL PHASE.

All the observations of the total phases are rejected from the discussion of longitude, because a slight error in the latitude of the observer is greatly magnified in its effect upon the computation of these phases, and has a corresponding influence in vitiating the results. These obsen·ations are also much affected by the jagged irregularities of the lunar disk.
EUROPEAN OBSElffATlONS, 01" WHICH THE BEGINNING AND THE END, BOTH OBSERVED ON THE SAME J'LACE 1 HA YE BEEN ADMITTED INTO THE COMPUTATION.

Gottinoen.-Both phases were observed hy Gauss, Westpha.l, aud Klinkerfues.-(A. X., vol. 33, p. 4 7.) TLe accuracy of observation may be inferred from the mean coincidence in the time of duration, wLich waR identical for the last two observers, and Gauss differed from them only by one second of time.

are of no sensible importance. 'l'he computation;;; of the phases for the various places are then continued in table C. In making the computations for these phases of which the longitudes are not given in the preceding portion of the report, such longitudes and latitudes have been used as seemed to be given by the best authorities. But, since no use has been made of these computations in the determination of the received longitude, there is no necessity of any careful criticism of these elements. The equationA of condition for the correction of the moon's latitude, longitude, and hori· zontal parallax, and for the sum of the semi-diameters of the sun and moon, are obtained by the following formulre : D 1 (m - a) = a'+ b' cot . .Y,.

The values of Dst, D.t, Dµt, Dwt, and D;..t were tl1en computed in table F, and in the same table the corresponding conection;;; were made in order to reduce the basis of computation to Hansen's tables as the neare,;t approach to the requisite accuracy. The comparison with observation resulting from this reduction sufficiently attests the propriety of this step, and illustrates the great excellence of Hansen's tables. The approximation to coincidence between the observed and cornpnted times of the phase,-, resulting from this last reduction, affordR the opportunity for preliminary criticism, mid at. ouce suggests the highly probable conclusion that the defects of observation are of such a kind a:-< to act in opposite directions upon the first and last pha~es, so that they will partially disappear from the mean. It fo, then, important to restrict the discussion to those ob:iervatious in wl1ich the same observer observed both phases, aml to divide the equations of condition into two sots, one of which involves the interval of duration and the other the mean time. The weight which should then be given to each equation is readily inferred from the previous criticism of the observations. The equations which involve the interval of duration are principally of use

APPENDIX No. 17.
TIEPOTIT OF PROFES'30lt BENJAMIN PEIRCE, LL.D., ON AN EXAMPLE FOU THE DETEU:l1INATION OF LONGITLDES BY OCCULTATIONS OF THE PLEI.ADES.

November 20, 1861. Sm : I have commenced the reduction of the observations of the Pleiades' occu1tatiorn> with tlic period 1838-184:2, inclusive. This is the only period, except the one which has just . terminated, which contains an~T simultaneous observations upon this continent. It is peculiarly valuable, because within this period Bessel made his triangulation of the Pleiarles. I have thought it expedient to prepare for you a complete example of the computatiou of 0110 of the simulta11eous sets of observation within thi;: period, in order that the mode of computation which I have adopted might be submitted to your criticism, and that.you may be able to come to a definite opinion in regard to the prolmble accuracy of the results. For this purpose I have selected the emersions for September 26, 1839. Tho following i8 a list of the observations, in 'vhich the Rtars are numbered in conformity with the catalogue upon page 19u of the Coast Survey report for 1856 :

Tho difference betffeen these results and those obtained from tlie reduction of the same ob,.;erYatio11s liy J\fr. Sears C. V\'nlker, and which are pnhlished in the proceedings of tho Philo,.;opl1ical Society of Pbiladt.:lpbia, {vol. i, p. 232,) is mainly due to the improved lunar parallax given hy tl1e tables of Hausen. The im portauce of this clement i;; indicated by Mr. \Valker in tlw Coast Survey Report of 1851. The results, now given, are to be taken as a fir::<t approximation, and are liablo to correction for lunar parallax, the places of the stars, and the ineqnalit.ies of the lunar disc. It is easy to ascertain the ultimate reduction of proba1i1e error which could possibly be obtained from those corrections, and hence to infer the iinal accuracy of tliis method of ascertaining the long;itudo. Thus the occultations of each star observed in England may be sul1jocted to a <.:orumon corredion, aIHl the same system of correction may be applied to the American observations. The following table contains the 8overnl steps of tho process, and the reduced probable error is found to be about 0.17s. of time in the longitude of vYashing:ton. It may then be inferred that the probable error of the longi tndc which will ro;;ult from all the occultations of the Pleiades will_ not exceed 0. 05s. of time. But this e~timate docs not include the probable enor arising from the error of the con:rnmt portion of the lunar parallax. The actual probable error of this constant cannot be as1<11med to l·c k"s than 0.''1 of arc, ·which corresponds to 0. J.5s. of time in the longitude of Amcrir,a.-(Sc'e p. 480 of Walker's report in the Coast Survey Report of 1851.) But I am c1uite confident that the occnltatiom; of the Pleiades will correct this constant, 80 that its probable crrnr will Le reduced by one-half its present amount, so that it is reasonable to conclude that the J7robalilP errnr qf tlie final lonyitude resultin[J from all the occultations qf tlte Plcicu1es will not e;x:ceerl one·te11th ef a secoud qf time. 'l'lie computatic>11s have been performed in duplicate by Mr. Charles S. Peirce, who has detected r;omP sma1l errors, which will be introduced into the future computations.

ABSTRACT OF THE REPORT OF DR. B. A GOCLD, ASSISTANT COAST sn:YEY, ON THE DETEm1H-L\TIOX OF LONGITUDE AT ALBANY, N. Y .. HY THE TELE<iRAPHIC METHOD.
CA~rBHIDGE, April 4, 18Gl. Sm: In conformity with yonr wi8lieR, I have the honor to submit ~m abstract of my report upon the difference of l011gitnde of t.110 cities of Albany and X ew Ymk, as deduced from the observations made for the purpose ill 1S5S. The observers were 1\IesRrE<. George W. Dean and Edward Goo<lf'ellow. assisted by 1\Ie;:srs. A. E. "\V'inslow and A. T. Mosman, and the plall of ob~crvation and modes of reduction and computation have been, in all respecfa, ac'.cordiug to the u,.;ual pradice of the Coast ::-\urvey for telegraphic measurements of longitude. The station point in Albany was in a small 'vooden building erected for the purpose in tho grounds of the Dudley Observatory, the block on which the transit ini'trumeut re8ted beiIJ~ 35.075 feet to the eastward of the meridian circle. The Nc.rn- York station wa.~ in the private observatory of Lewis l\L Rutherford, esq., at the corner of Second avenue and l~leventh street, and two feet eleven inches east of the point oceupied by Mr. Walker in tile longitude determinat;ons made by him for the Coast 8urvey in 18±8. For transit instruments the two portable instruments of the Coast Survey, Nos. 4 and G, were employed; the former at Albany, the latter at New York. They are essentially similar, each haviug a clear aperture of about twenty-eight Paris lines, and a focal length of fort;v-six inches, and being used with an eye-piece magni(1ing about 100 times. Their diaphragm,- were provided 'vi th five equidistant "tallies," each consistini.:· of five vertical threads at intervals of 2s.5 equatorial time, the spaces between the nearest threads of the adjacent tallie,; bning about 5s. In Albany the transit instrument wa,.; mounted in the ordinary way, its iron frnme resting upon a granite block tl1ree feet wide and one foot thick, which was im bedded in the ground to the depth of three feet, and rose to a height of thirty inches above the fiooriug. lu New York

The Hardy clock of tl1e Com;t Survey was SU>'pe11det1 upou tlle brick foundt1t ion wall of the K'\Y. lia;,;eme11t room of the Dudley Observatory, this position :,:eeming to afford the best i"Ccnrity again,.;t smlcleu or cxtreme variatious of temperature.

The Kes~d' s clock was l1m1g upon .Mr. Rutherford" s clock-pier, and was included in a galvanic circuit E<imilar in all respects to that at Albany. The ground com1exion at each station was formed by a large copper plate buried some feet deep in ihe eartli, a!ld \\'W' eo1mederl witb tlw office of the Xew York, Alliany. and 13uffolo Tekgrnph Company b:· a tcmpnrar; line of ~o. lJ irou wire, aliuut a quart.er of a mile bci11g pnt lip ,;peciall,Y fur the p1irp""e in Allian:-, and about three miles in New York.

Aud, finally, a sufficient num her of obsen·ations on circumpolar and other star,; over all the twenty-five threads of the diaphragm, to determine the intervals of these thread,; as perfectly as posi,iible, In addition to this general programme it was arnrngc·d that all the circumstances of the obRervations should be varied as much as posl'ihlc; sometimes the full streugth of the batteries, and sometimes yery few cups being employed, and tlie direction of the current being reversed from time to time. During the first part of each night's work the signals were to be recorded by means of the Hardy clock, at Albany; and during the last part hy means of the Kessel' s clock, at New York. And aR usual, abo, in all our telegraphic longitude determinations reversals of each transit instrument and readings of the etlier level were to be made alternately with the observations of transit:,1. The exchange of star signah; was to lie reganled as satisfactory when the tram;it of tl1e star over not less than fit'tccu tlueads was obsern·tl at C<LCh station, aud well recorded upon both chronograph1c ruµ:isters at l1oth stations. The minimum 1111mher of such exchan~eR required in each position of ub,;ervers was ~.ixty, or a11 average of twenty stars a night.

The horizontal lines inclicate an intentional change macle in the a<ljustrnent of tlw instrument or of the clock. It will Le seen that the amount of motion in azimntl1 is qnite consideraLle on some niglits. In Alliany this St>em;; to he due to !'Orne extent to tlte motion of tlie hill on which the observatory stan<ls, a motion of which the exi:;tcrlt'e is almnda11tly ronfirmed h;.· otlter observations, and which I found very manifest in the great merirlia11 circle of tlw ohservator:» Iu Xew York, the motion, though often greater, wa;;: less regular, ;md indeed Jes~ capable of measurement, by reason of the proximity of the instrument to the paved thoroughfares and massive mason work of the city. A i·cgular increase of the azimuthal correction during the evening was indicated, the effect corresponding to a motion of the western end of the axis in a wutberly direction. The values of the corrections in collimation and azimuth, and of the clock rateR deduced from the tables already given and employN1 in the reduction of the longitude flignals, on the six "telegraph nights," are as followg. They were. assumed as constant duriug the exchange of Rignals, except the azimuth of the transit instrument in New York, which bas licen assumed as varying proportionally to the time on four of the nights.

For the telegraphic Rignals of transits of stars exchanged for longitude, the rcrords upon each of the four chronographs have been independent!;- read off by two different at:si:o;tants, and all cases where the discordance between the two readings exceeded Os. 02 have been exam-

ined and corrected. The means of the two readings furnish the data emplo}'ed. There are thus at onr di:'<posal four complE'te records of every telegraphic signal made during- the observation, each sig11al g;ivillg the time of au ol1served transit over a single thread, and the number of such signal~ averng:ing. a~ already 13(aLL'd, 18 at ead1 station for each star exchanged. The record,; of the Mor,;e register, aud of the Rpring governor at each station, are usually accordant within narrow aml well established limits, depelldiug upon the amount of irregularity in the motion of the oue or the other of these two chronographs between two successive clock-boats. vVhen their discrepancy has exceeded a prescTibed limit of permissible discordance, the records have been again examined and one OT uoth values rejected, if the circumstanceR of the case seemed to require it. The mean between the readings of the spring governor sheets aml the Mor:-<e Tegister fillets waR then m1optec1 af' the record of the transit at. tlrnt station. The records at the twl) ;;tations differ from each other theoretically only by the iuterval of time rnquired by the telegraphic sig11al for tru\·ersing the wire once in each direction; for the clock signals, "·hich mark the Leginuiug of each sccoud, are recorded oarlieT at the station where the clock itself is, while the observation signals, given by the observeT at the other station, are recorded later on tlic same Tcgistcr, nn<l 1'ice ve··sa. A mean between the times recorded at tho two :-taticms will thus ]ip free from the effect of their delay in trn11smission, while the difference l1etween them will afford a mea,.;ure of its amount. The moments of ob,;erved trau;.;it over the several tliread;;, being thus determined, Lave been reduced to the corresponding time for the mean of all the threads, to permit the applicatio11 of Peirce's criterion, which has Leen employed in every case to exdude had ob;;ervatious and to g:uard agai11t;t unauthot·ize<l rejections. Finally, the mean of the several thre11d8 corrected for errors of azimuth and collimation was adopted as the time of tnrnsit, and the interval Let ween the times for the two f'tations afforded the de,.ired rnea:rnrement of the longitude. The followiug" table exl1ibit8 the values furnished by different stars aud on different nights. The stars are dl·Bignate<l by their numbers in the Catalogue of the British A,;sociation, from which the list was selected. The values rejected by the criterion, and therefore not incorporated into the result, are inclosed in brackets.

The observations in the firnt and second position differ theoretically by twice the amount of the personal equations. A. strong corroboration of our adopted value is fornis1ied by an independent subsidiary discu;.;sion of the rig ht ascens:ons of the Rtan; employed. The observations made at the station whose dock is graduating the record give for each star a value L!. a= L!. t - w, but observations made by means of the clock at the other station furnish the analogous quantities i. ± L::. a= L::. t-w, the upper sign applying "'hen the eastern clock is in circuit. Inasmuch as every exchange of star trausits thuR gives one value of L!. a and one of ) ± L::. a, we may combine the mean of the values outained for the frirmer with the mean of each of the latter, and so obtain a value for the longitude, which, although not derived from data strictly independent, may yet be fairly regarded as an iudependent determination. Of course such a value is inferior in precision to that which is free from the influence of errors in the adopted clock correction and personal equation; f'till the following table ,;hows how fully this mode of determination corroborates the previout< re1<ult. The values of i. ± 6. a are corrected for personal equation, by substracting, on the fifft three nights, and adding on the la8t three, the quantity Os. 034.

REPORT OF THE SUPERIXTENDEXT OF

These results <liffer l>y tl1e sum of the transmission time in the two directions, which, from thi8 ronµ·h dckrmination, would seem tn be Os.052. or almut half this amount in each direction. Their half ;;nm give:<, a,.; tlie l>PRt value ohtni11uhle from this rnode of combination, 57s.454 from 152 ob,,crvation:o. In tl1is abstract of our result" I have not entered upon the quei-'tion of velocity of the tele· graphic signals. This has hee11 thoroughly discnssficl, and the resnlts by the two wires com· pared. but it has 110 hearillg upon the purpo"e of the present report, inasmuch as the time of transmiFsion has been c·ompletely elimi11ated. The a'\'erage time of transmistiion of a signal ·was three bumlrr~dtl1~ of a second. Finally. the indivirlnal determinations classified according to stars, give, as the mean result, 57s.44G ± 08.012 from 52 different stars. The thorough accordance of our final values, no matter what the principle adopted in their comhiuation, rcmlers it -vcr;' improliable in my judgment that the adopted result can be in error by more than the hundredth part of a second. The longitude of the station point in New York, as determined by Mr. Walker, was0/i. 12m. 15s.4.7 eas {, from W ashiugton, (Observatory.) 0 11 26s.07 west from Cambridge, (ObserYatory dome.) Hence, we have for the longitude of the station point in ~Ubany Oh. Om. 578.45 east from New York. 0 13 12s.92 east from Washington. 0 10 28s. G2 Wetlt from CarnLridge. The geodetic reduction to the meridian circle of the Dudley Observatory is Os.034, and to tho centre of the dome the reduction is - 08.051. er:· respectfully, your obedient serYant, B. A. GOULD.

OD8ERYATIONS OF TIIE SOLAR ECLH'SE OF 1860, JULY 18, MADE AT THE COASr SURVEY STATION, CUNSTOCK MOUNTAIN, NEW IIAMPSHIIlE, BY PHOFES~OR A. D. BACHE, SUPERINTENDENT UNITED STA.TES COAST SUiffEY.

L Coast Survey station Gurrntock is in the township of Guilford, Belknap county, New Hampshire, latitude 41° 31' 03" N., longitude 7P 21' 50 11 (4h. 45m. 27s.4) approximate, west of Gree11wid1; and ha;; an elevation of about 2,440 feet above the mean level of the sea. The instruments having been carefully readjm1ted for the purpose, hourly observations of magnetic declination and horizontal force, in connexion with reg,1lar meteorological observations, were made two days before, and (except the observations of the horizontal force*) continued for two clay;; after the eclipHe. On these four days during the t'nl hours next preceding the time of beginning, and the two following that of the eud of the eclipse, the magnetic and meteorological observations were made half-hourly, and during the times cone><pouding with that of the eclip>ie they were made every two minute;;, aucl during the eclipse itself observations of the temperature of the air and solar radiation were made every half minute. So f11r as practicable, all these observations were made simult.a neously with similar ones which were assigned for the party sent to Cape Clrnd1eigh, Labrador, nuder :he charge of Professor Alexander.
<>In a violent storm on the morning of the l!lth the bifilar tent was blown down, deranging the instruments to such an extent ao to prevent furthe1· oLservationH uf horiwnt.al fore!!.

During the mornings of July 16 and 17, at times correr;ponding witl1 tl1at of tlie eclipr<e on the 18th, obr<ervations of the tranr;its of solar spot;;, and <lnrn·ing;s of the same. were made in cmmexion with the r.lrill practice of the aid,; in couuting: aud nu ti Ilg" time: expcriuH:nts were a eo made with screens of different coiors, kc .· &e. Tlic weather on the morning of the 18t!t prnvl'rl rernarkal>l,\- favor:1],]r;, Frnm snnri,-p until 10 a. rn. scarce1y a cloud olJseured tlw sky. the temperature of tl1e air ran;,:·i11;; frurn ;)[!to 65° Fahr., with a lig·ht breeze from the southwest at 110 time exceeding two mile~ an hour. The i11strumen t >vl1id1 I used was a Dollond telel'.<cope of six feet focal length and aperture of four inches, (C. S. No. I,) equatorially mounted, and proYidcd with a dark box for projecting the image of the sun upon a screen. After some experiments the mag:nifyinf! power of G4 was selected for observing the times; but for making drawi11g" of the 8pols the power 1:31 was used. With the power 64, the diameter of the sun's projected image wao; 5. 7 inches. The tr>rn:-lits were observed upon a white screen, with parallds in red. 2 . .First contact.-The minute,;, second:-;, and iiali' seconds, were eounted alom1 by ~Ir. Toomer, who was stationed at the chronometer.

The point of contact agreed preC'isely, as observed, with previous computation. The elevation referred to above was the western of two which were noticed shortly afterward. Contact had certainly not taken place at 45s., and probauly not at 48s. Tho sun's limb wns well defined, with but little tremulous rnotio11. lJir. 11lcDonnell, who observed the contaet8 \Yitl1 n Fraunl10for telc:<cope of 4G ind1cs focaJ length and an aperture of three ind1es, with a power of 8-1, uoted the time of di,J;: fully 011 as 7h. 22rn. 51s.6. 1J1r. Dean observed the contacts with the telescope of the 30-inch theodolite, (No. 1, C. S .. ) having a focal length of 46 inches and aperture of three illches, aud using a power of u1out 115, with the darkest shade of London smoke. This irn;trument being at wme distance from the others, he noted the time from a siclereRl clironometer.-(Hntton, No. 20~.) The oliservcd time of disk fully on was 7h. 22rn. 53s. 7 Gunstock mean time; but Mr. Dt.!au remarks that this is perhaps two seconds too late. When the moon's limb had fully passed, I noticed two prominences near the point of beginning, the westerly one havinp; made the first contact. This cPrtainly had uot occurred at 4Is., and probably not at 44s. The edge of the moon was well defined, nnd had hut little apparent motion. 3. Position qf 8pol'l'.--T1rn adopted nomr.nclatnrn denotes groups of 8pot,.: hy capit;il letter~, .A, B, C, D, &c., and in in di vidnal mem lie rs of grnups by tlw 8mall letter", a, b, c, d, &c. The field of the telescope was divided into oetants by four spi<ler-li11et:, and the eiµ:ht radii distinguished by numerals 0 to 7, 0 denoting the north, 2 the east, -! tbe 1>outh, aud 6 the west lines, respectively. The following four sets of transit obsern1tionH \Yere made, 011 tho 17th and 18th July, to determine tho position of tho spoti;.

Tlie errors and rates of the chronometers were well determined by JJir. Toomer, on tbe nights before and after the eclipse, with a 2G-inch transit instrument, Ly "'\Yurdemann, nhserving nine zenith and circumpolar stars (with rn·crRal of instrument) on eacl1 night. The chrouometcr corrccti'.ms have Leen applied to the times as giYon al1ove. G.

At 971. 20m. tlie outliue was obl'erYed to dmnge cuusideraLly, particularly near the we8tern cusp, where the di,.;k apparently becllIHe "uddenl_y elongated. At about Sh. 20m. an appearance v,·as remarked iu the southeast limb which looked upon the screen like a mn.ss of cumulus douds; the top:; illuminated, the bases gray in shadow, and the dark line appeariJJg like the shapes of their bases. The shape and degree of illumination seemed to vary rapidly; this was, however, probably an illusion, as the dark lines >Yero stationary, and their forms persistent under the l1e~t illmnination. They were re1watedly noticed during the eclipse, and were quite noticcal;]e at lh., and, thongh le,.;s marked, were quite well seen at llt. 30m. p. m. The next day the dark lim hs had opened out into spots.

OBSERVATIONS OF THE SOLAR ECLIPSE OF .TULY 18, 1860, UADE AT THE COAST 8URYEY OFFICE, WASH· IN'GTON, D. C., BY CRAHLES A. SCHOTT, ASSISTANT UNITED STATES COA~'T SUR\'EY.-iSKETcll Xo. 2\J i

The observations were made at a station in the vicinit.Y of the Coast Snrvey oflice, in latitude 38° 53' 03".8 N.; longitude 77° 00 1 07".8 "'\Y. from Greeirwich; these values being derived by direct measurement from the trigonoruetrical station at one of tl1e oftice linil<liugs. The telescope was the one ordinarily used hy me for olisen·ing solar l'jJOis, (Frauubofer and Utzschneider, C. S., No. 12,) of four feet focal length, and equatorially mounted. A. power of 55 was used, and the sun's image projected a).!:ainst a screen in a dark box. The last contact, and tbe contacts with the solar :>pot~, were ohserved with a power of about 175. The local time was determined ·with a Gambey sextant, from observations of equal altitudes of the sun, using a mean time chronometer, (Kessels, No. 1287.) Both before and after the eclipse two sets of observations of the solar spots were taken, according to the mode of observation employed b:;· Mr. Carrington. About 4k a. m. the sky was clear, but gradually n haze J"Oi'P oYer the river, and interfered in some degree with the observations of the first contact. These wereChron. time.

OBSERVATIONS OF THE SOLAR ECLIPSE OF JULY 18, 1860, MADE AT CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS, BY B. A. GOULD, ASSISTANT UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

The eclipse was observed very satisfactorily at the Cloverden station of the Coast Survey. All the observations were made by Mr. Searle, except the beginning, which was observed by me. The telescope has an aperture of 4. 6 inches, and a magnifying power of about 80 times was employed. The error and rat.e of the chronometer were thoroughly determined by a series of transit observations on several successive nights before and after the eclipse; so that no error except that of the observers' perception need be apprehended.

APPENDIX No. 22.
DISCUSSION OF THE RECULAR CIIA~GE OF THE MAGNETIC INTENRITY (HORIZONTAL AND TOTAL) ON TRE ATLANTIC, GULF, AND PACIFIC COASTS OF THE UNITED STATES.-BY ASSISTANT CHARLES A. SCHOTT.
COMPUTING DIVISION, COAST SURVEY, Janua,ry 19, 1861. Sm: In conformity with the Superintendent's directions, the secufar change of the magnetic declination and inclination for stations in the vicinity of the coast of the United States bas been investigated, and in order to complete these papers there remained the discussion of the magnetic intensity. I herewith respectfully submit so much of this investigation as the present state of the material will permit, thinking that a collection of the observations, reduced to the same absolute r;cale, would be of advantage at this time for the purposes of comparison or discussion. The table of re~mlts for horizontal and total intensity, here given, should therefore he considered as preliminary to the investigation of the secular change which it is proposed to resume hereafter. The collection of magnetic iutensities embraces stations on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, aud a few inland and foreign stations, and is believed to contain all observations, taken a suflicient number of years apart, for the recognition of changes of intensity. It includes hori:wntal as well as total intensity (with but a few exceptions) at 36 stations, for which the total number of observations is over 270. The earlier observations, before the introduction of Gauss's method of expressing the force in absolute value are imperfect, and should be considered as subject to slight corrections. They involve the secular change of the total force at the base stations, Woolwich or Toronto, of which we have as yet but a very imperfect knowledge. It may be considered as fortunate that the total force at Woolwich has apparently undergone little or no change since absolute determinations were made. Dr. Lamont, in his discussion and delineation of isomagnetic lines in central Europe, arrives at the same conclusion. At Toronto, also, the secular change is very small. In the conversion of the relative into absolute numbers, the value 10.388 for total intensity at Woolwich, in absolute scale, corresponding to 1.372 of the arbitrary scale, bas been u~ed and is considered as constant in the conversion of the earlier observations. The

results given by General Sabine, in the volume for 184G of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, were of the greatest advantage in the conversion of the various relative numbers; the determinations at many statiom; depending, either directly or indirectly, on the value for Toronto. 'l'he total intensity at this station, iu the arbitrary scale, is 1. 83() between 1842 and 1846; and the total intensity, in absolute measure, may be taken as 13.Hl, answering very nearly for the years between 1845 and l 851. The connexion with Toronto is particularly valuable for the extensive series of Dr. Locke, for which purpose the intensity at Cincinnati had to be carefully discussed. General Sabine adopts 13.G9 for the total force in absolute measure, (l.795 in arbitrary scale,) answering between the years 1838 and 18-1±. For that period the horizontal intensity at Cincinnati may be taken equal to 4.548, Toronto being 3.540 (nearly.) From the observed total intensity and dip the horizontal intensity is obtained by meami of the relation X = <p cos.O. The magnetic observations of the U. S. Coast Survey were commenced in 1844, and with some exceptions, in the earlier yean;, the absolute horizontal iutensity was observed at each station. The total intensity was deduced from the observed dip. The intensity is expressed in English units (grain aud foot.) For the conversion of the intensitieR exp essed in French units (millimeter and milligramme) the multiplier 2 .1G95 was used. For the conversion of relative results into absolute the necessary information is given in tho notes appended to the tables. The localities are arranged in geographical order, commencing in the northeast, proceeding to the southward and westward, and terminating with the station:,; on the Pacific coast. The first column for eacl1 8tation contains the reference number; the second, the date arranged chronologically; the third, the name of the observer; the fourth, the reference to the observations; the fifth, the locality; and the sixth and seventh, the horizontal (X) and total 'f, magnetic intensity, expressed in absolute measure.

REPORT OJ<' THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Tlie total force at Toronto was computed from tho horizontal force and the dip, given in vol. iii of the Toronto ~fagnetical and :Meteorological Observatiom. Tlie secular change of the intensity can liest be ascertained from observations taken at the same station and with the same instrument as at Toronto, for instance. In the present case, however, we have in general neither of these essential conditions, and the results deducible dependiug on various observers, insfruments, and localities, cannot claim to be more tlurn approximations, particularly when we consider the comparatively short interval of time elapsed since measures of the intensity were first taken. 'l'he comparison of ti1e results, inter se, at any one station shows, iIJ the differences, the combined effect of the error of observation and instrumental constants, of local deviation, of disturbances at the time of observation, and of errors due to regulrtr variations in the intensity, if not allowed for. Tbe secular change of the intensity, in its total effect, is small, compared with the above irregnlaritieF, an<l it can, therefore, be ascertained only by a combination of results at a number of stations. For tl1is purpose I have formed two nearly equal groups of the obf'ervccl horizontal intensities at eacb station and compared their resulting mean, from which the annual effect of the change is made out. For 'l'oronto the annual decrease of force is 0.0026, in vol. ii; it is changed to 0. 0037 ±0. 0009 in vol. iii. The first value, however, is hero preferred. Two groups bave been formf~d, one for the Atlantic, the otl1er for the Pacific coast, and a few stations were omitted on account of uncertainty in the earlier dct.crminations. In the following tables, showiug the results for each locality, the column headed 1j _ con. x tains the annual change in parts of the foree, a minus sign indicating decrease of horizontal force ; the colunm headed i contains the interval of time expressed m years Letweeu the two groups, and tho last column contuius the number of observations:

Giving· weights in reference to i aud n, we find for stations belonging to the Atlantic group an annual decrea8e of 0. 0011, (parts of horizontal intensity,) and for stations 011 the Pacific coast an annnal increa8e of 0. 0015, (parb of horizontal intensity.) In reference to the RC('ular cl1ange in the total iutcusity, it may lrn remarked that the np:reerncnt in tho tabular numberr-< at each station is not as good as for the lwri:.rnutal inteu;.;ity. owing: to the additional uncertainty in the observed dips which were used in the computati011 of the greater number of results. Appendixes Nos. 32 and 33 of the Coast SurYey report for 18.'iG contain the di~cnssion of the secular change of the dip for stations on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and the conclusions reached within the t?:eographical limits of the former were, that the dip attained a minimum about the latter part of 184~, and that the present annual increase of the dip is about 2:J,.'. On the Western Coast it was found that the dip was on the im:rease, (probably since 183G,) with an annual rate of about 2'. From the above data the secular change in the total intensity can be inforrcd. Thus, on the Atlantic coast, (within the limit,; of the dip discu,;sion,) at the present time, it is slightly on the increa8c; the amount, however, is hardly perceptible in the preceding abstract of results. On the Pacific coast the total intellsity is now, also, slightly on the increase. Yours, very respectfully,

Sm: A new discussion of the distribution of tlw magnetic declinatiou for the coast of the Gulf of Mexico having been approved by you, I herewith respectfully r<uhmit tlie resnlts obtained hy using all the material now available, and referring the same to a common epoch, viz: the first of January, lSGO. This report is accompanied by a chart. fll10wi11f: tl1e isogonic lines for the epoch stated. For comparison, see tho c1irves obtained in your first discussion of 185G (improved from that of 1855) for an epoch ten years prior to that now adopted. Observations. -The list of observed magnetic declinations on and near the Gulf of Mexico, referred to .Janua.ry, 1 SGO, and arranged in a convenient geographieal order, has bee11 made up from observations by parties of the United States Coast Survey, to which a few others have been added from otl1cr sources. They are all of comparatively rec-ent date, tlie oldest elate admitted being 1840. In all cases the latitudes and longitudes arc givm1 according to the best authorities available; for some stations, however, the longitudes arc still vcr~· imperfrctly known, and may possibly bo found in error by several minutes, (of arc;) for these we have to wait for new determinations. l,P the discussions of the magnetic declinations on the Gulf (and tlie .A.tlantic and Paeific coasts) for the epoch 1850, see Coast Survey rep0rts for 1855, appendix :Ko. 47, and for 185G, appendix No. 28, with charts, by A. . D. Bache, Superintendent, and .J. R HilgarJ, Assistant. The total number of ;;tations entering in these discu~sions was 16; tlieRe have now been increased to 3ti.

1850 and 18GO, are, therefore, not entirely due to the effect of the secular change during a dccennium, but depend, also, on tlie largely increased material now brought to bear on the ret<ult. Secular cl1011ue.--Thc oliscrvatiorn; of 11115 and 1857 at Havana, Cuba, indicate an annual chaugc of 11early +1'.5, (tlw sign+ indicates an increm;e of wet<t declination.) The formula 011 page ;~:.!5 Coast Survey 1·eport of 1855 gives + l'. 5. The discussion of the oh,,;ervations at SavanuaL, Georgia, in Coast Survey report of 1859, page 300, gave +l'.8. These numbers have been adopted for the reduction of the :Florida observations from the date of observation to the epoch adopted, (lSG0.0.) The following observations were collected for Key West, viz: 0 :February, 18:W. W. A. Whitehead found G 25' east, (see map of Florida, topographical engilleers, 184G.) Jn 1843 the variation at the cm;torn-house is stated to be 6° 02' east, (see report of Com. L. M. Powell, U nitod States navy.) Comparing the mean of these observations with the value found in 1860, (see table further on,) the amrn::il increase seems to be as much as +3'.5a vahie certai11ly too great. The discus;.;ion i11 Coast Survey report, 1859, page 300, gives the ammal change for Mobile, Alabama, + l'. l, and from two observations at East Pascagoula, :Mississippi, made in June, 1847, aud January, 185G, the annual change is +o'. 5. Proceeding further to the westward, at New Orleans, Louisiana, from the obsern1tions of Lason, in 1806, (-Ss 03',) and of A.ssistant Dean, in April, 1858, (-7° 52',) the annual change appears to be very small, ( +o'. 2,) and will propably reach zero in \Yes tern Louisiana. Of the secular change on the coast of Texas we have as yet no positive information, and consequently no attempt has been made to refer the oht<ervations to a later epoch. This reduction, if ascertained hereafter, will probably be found small, and may possibly have the opposite sign from that on the eastern side of the Gulf.

1Jlef1wd f!l reduction.-The interpolation formula for tl1e distriliutioll of the magnetic declination on the Gulf is that generally used for diticussions extending oYer a considerable area necessarily taking in second differences. It wai;: first proposed hy the Rev. H. Lloyd in 1838.(See the eighth report of the British Association, vol. VII, p. 91; )lagnetic Snrvcy of Great Britain, Ly Major Sabine, section III, Ireland, by Llte Rl'V. II. Lloyd.) H is as follows Z= L 1\I x Ny P x2 Q xy R y2 &c. For greater convenience it may be written in the followiug form : D D0 + d xdL yd M z d L d M +pd U q d )p where D = resnlt.ing declination, D 0 =an assumed declination for the epoch adopted, and the mean latitude and longi· tude, d its correction, d L= difference of latitude, d M = diffenmce of longitude. x, y, z, p, q, as well as d, a.re tu be c1ctermi11ed by application of the method of least. squareR from the obse1·vations themselves. To adapt this formula to the spberical surface, a slight ;tlteration has l>ecn introduced, by multiplying the terms involving d M by cos. L. --(~c ', also, Lloyd's paper in the fifth report of tbe British Association, 1835.)

In forming tliese gronps we have the ad vantage of shortening the discussion by saving the formation of normal equations, and also, what is of special importance, we lessen the effect of any local deviation, which frequently affects the results injuriously. Hereafter, when a greakr number of observations can l>e made available, it will be proper to combine the ol>ser· vationi! in a greater 11umbcr of groups, making· their area and uumber of stations in each as rnarl.Y equal as may be practicable. Tho present discussion should bo considered a;; a second 1 approximation, the first having been published in the Coast Survey reports of 1855 and 1856. Equal weights lrnve been given to the result;; of each group. In the numerical computation I was a,-,;i8ted by Mr. \Vies8ner, of this division. From the above six groups, the following ret-tulting equation was deduced: D 7°.44 0.084 dL - 0.375 d M cos. L-0.022 dL d.M cos. L 0.0142 dL 2 2 2 0.0170 cl..M cos. L. This expression will give the magnetic declination for January, 1860, expressed in degrees and decimals. dL =Lat. - 28°.3:2, and dlI =Long. - 88°.73. It repre::;ents the normal declinations as follows:

.Applying Peirce's criterion to the differences between the observed and computed values for the thirty-six stations, it was found that two values were excluded, viz : the first, Havana, (llifference 0°.56,) and the nine~centh, Lower peach ~ree, (diffore~ce + 0°.51.)

The coefficients of the terms d L and r.l I...2 are uece:<saril:- very uncertain. owjng to the want of observations in the middle of the Gulf; the small curvature of the isog;onic lines principally depends on these terms ; the observations, however, are nearly equally represented by either expression, J or If. Intersections for each line between 4° and 8° were next computed, and the curves plotted for each equation, when it was found that a mean curve between the two answered most satisfactorily.

The stations 1 and lD have therefore not been entire!~· rejected, but received less weight, which is allowable, sinee they were near the limit of rejection in system I. Comparing the above expression with that <lelluced for January, 1850, with a less number of observations, (see Coast Survey report for 18.55, pp. 302, 303-the signs should t.liere first be changed to have east declination, indicated by a minus sign,) the agreement of the isogonic lines for the two epochs is such as to show that no important alteration was produced by the introduction of the new ob;,ervations. · The agreement between the observed and computed values is as follows: 1c.25 dL -

The probable error of any single representation (omitting 1, 13, and 19) is, accordingly, ~· .6 o.s45 ~~=(;=G") (See Coast Survey report, 1856, A.ppendix No. 59.)

E = ± 0°.11 = ± G'.5 In the first dieicussion (Coast Suney report, 1855, p. 303) this error is stated to be 3'. 3. In this case, hmvever, the number of olrnervatiom; was r<mall for the accurate determination of this quantity; besides, in three groups, each consisting of but one station, the error must necessarily be zero. Yours, very respectfully, CHAS. A. SCHOTT, A.ssistant U. S. Coast Survey, in charge qf Computing Divisz'.on. Professor A. D. BACHE, S11perinte11dwt U. S. Coast Su1'vey.

APPEKDIX No. 24.
NEW DISCUSSION OF THE DISTRIBl:TION OF THE: :MAGNETIC DECLINATION ON THE COAST OF VIRGINIA, NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CABOLINA, AND GEORGIA, WITH A CHART OF THE ISOGONIC CURVES Jl'OR 1860. BY ASSISTANT CHARLES A SCHOTT.-(S1aan1 No. 32.)
COMPUTING DIYISJON COAST SURVEY, July 2, 1861. Srn: In compliance with your desire, I have submitted the observed magnetic <leclinatiou along the coast of Virginia, North and South Oarolirrn, and Georgia to a uow discussion, and constructed a map showing the resulting isogonic lines for the epoch January, DEAR

18GO.

The preeent discussion may he considered as an extension of your discussions in 1855 and 185G.-(See Coast Survey reports for 1855, Appendix No. 47, and for 185G, Appendix :r\o. 28, on the general distribution of terrestrial magnetism in tlw L"nited States, from olJservations made in the· U. S. Coast Survey and others, by A. D. Bache, Superintendent, and J. E. Hilgard, Assistant U. S. Coast Survey.) The epoch ii; now brought forward ten yeari;, aml the method of di,-cussion has been slightly changed. Ser:ular change.-For Section III the annual change has generally been adopted as+ 2'.5 for thti present time. At Williamsburg, Virginia, the increase was found + 31 · 7.-(Coast f-:urvey report, 1859, .Appendix No. 24.) It is ouly an approximation, au<l certainly too great. The value + 2'.5 haoi been adopted for the coast bet,Yeen the eapeH of the Chesapeake and Cape Fear. At Charlef<ton the formula (Coai=t Survey report, 1859, Appendix No. 24) gives + 3'.2 for 1850 anrl 1860, a value apparently one minute too high, but borne out by five observations as collected in the Coast Survey reports of 1855 a11d 1859. To these the followiflg additioual values can be added: Variation at Charleston Febrnary, 1784, 5° 15' cast, and in October, 1785, 5° 45' east, by Joseph Purchell, surveyor. (Both values appear to be somewhat too great.) In OctobiJr, 1847, it was 2° 15' east.-(See a pamphlet by Charles Parker, Charleston, 18±0.) Tbe latter value agrees well with those previously collected. For Charleston + 3'.0 has been adopted. For Savannah, Ga., we have the valuei; + l'.5 and + I'.8 for the epochs 1850 and 1860, (Coast Survey report, 1859, Appendix No. 24,) which values have been adopted. For :Florida the value+ 1'.5 has been used.-(See preceding discussion of the Gulf of Mexico magnetic declinations in .June, 1861.) The observaifons.-The stations selected are all of comparative recent date, and are 21 in number, within the geographical limits of the dit:;cuesion. The observations have all been made by parties of tho Coast Survey. In the following table, containing the names, reference,

.A. graphical construction of the isogonic lines, by means of the above ten combinations, at once shows that the three stations on Albemarle sound (7, 8, 9) are greatly affected by local deviation, the extent of which we are not able to define for want of more observations ; it is probable that stations 1 and 2 are affected in an opposite way ; taking a mean value, therefore, of the first three combinations we may hope to eliminate as much as possible the effect of these deflections on the general system. To simplify the process of elimination of the unknown quantities two other contractions of combinations were made, viz. 4 and 5, and 7 and 8, thus forming the following six final groups :

The probable error of any single representation (omitting the large local difference of station (8)) is= ± 0°.19 or± 11'.6. Owing to the scanty material, the general curvature of the isogonic lines, as computed for each degree of declination between l 0 and - 4° by the above formula, seems to be somewhat greater than what might have been expected from the discussion of the adjoining sections, and it is therefore desirable that the formula be used only within the strict geographical extent of the places of observation. .A_ slight compromise has been made in the graphical representation of the - 4° curve as resulting from the above expression and that found in the discussion for the Gulf of Mexico. The 1~ 0 + 2° 2~ and+ 3° curves have been added from a recent discussion of the section III magnetic observations, 44 in number. Whether such local deflections, extending over a considerable area, as noticed on Albemarle sound (stations 7, 8, 9) and elsewhere on our seacoast, are constant, or whether they are produced by variations in the rate of secular change, or, in other words, whether they are stationary or shifting with the general change of the isogonic lines, is a subject of inquiry which must be reserved for the future, as it can only be ascertained by repeated and careful observations. For the present it suffices to apply a correction to the computed values as resulting from the above formula, which correction is given (with the proper sign) in the column of differences in the preceding table. These differences may serve, hereafter, for the construction of lines of equal anomaly, (isabnormal lines) which will plainly exhibit the extent and centres of the disturbed regions, together with the amount of deflection. Yours, very respectfully,

The continuation of part of the results of my observations of the ~lar spots, noticed in your last year's report, (1860, Appendix No. 25, pp. 324-326,) is herewith respectfully submitted. The observations have been made in the same manner as explained in detail in that report. During my temporary absence from Washington between July 9 and October 28, 1861, while engaged on field duty, the observations were attended to by Assistant L. F. Pourtales. The interruptions of ten days in August and of nine in September are due to unfavorable weather. I was also assisted by Mr. J. H. Patton and by Mr. J. 'Wiessner, by the former in noting transits, by the latter in noting time, since May last. The observations were m·:ide generally between the hours of one and two.

A comparison of Professor Wolf's revised numbers for 18GO (see his Mittheilungen, xii, pp. 69-71) with mine, shows that the factor with which the above figures 1ad been multiplied to refer them to the st:rndard of his telescope is 1.19. On two days, viz: the 11th and 12th of May, 1861, I found the sun without any spots. The observations for heliocentric latitudes and longitudes of spots have been continued as in the preceding year.

Below Diego Plains the general characteristics of the outside beach, the sand hills, and other surface features, are in every respect similar to the parts surveyed just ll'Jrth of St. Augustine.* The Guano river scarcely merits the name, yet it retains all the characteristics of a river to its head, its channel and shoals being as well defined throughout a8 those of the North river, of which it is only a branch. Six foet of water can be had in the North river up to its head in Diego Plains, upwards of eighteen miles north of St. Augustine. At that place it divides into two large creeks. Above the mouth of the Guano rivet ten feet may be carried to within a mile of the head of the main river. The channel, however, is very intricate. * * * * * * * The San Pablo road, which was taken as the inland boundary of the plane-table work, follows the coast between the St. John's and St. Augustine, at distances varying between three-quarters of a mile to a mile and three quarters. The coast line above St. Augustine is remarkably straight. At low water a firm, level sand beach is exposed, sixty to ninety metres wide.

This belt of sand hills and woods has a breadth of from a quarter to a half mile. In going northward one of the ranges of sand hills disappears abruptly, and thence on the elevations in the other rarely exceed fifteen feet. The sand hills are mostly covered with scrub palmetto and with a long, stiff grass, which keeps them more compact than similar features on other parts of the Atlantic. The prairie is generally level, with occasional ponds, a few scattered pines, clumps of palmetto, and hummocks of small live-oak, and is backed by the sandy pine barren. * * * Yours, very respectfully, F.

Srn:

*

*

South of Anclote Keys, the western coast of the Florida peninsula is easy of access, and affords ample facilities for tho rapid prosecution of the survey. Bold, prominent bluffs appear in striking contrast with the low, swampy border of the coast above. Nine feet of water can be carried through Anclote inlet into St. Joseph's bay. The channel is ne3rly straight, and runs about northeast, midway between South Anclote and Hog island. Anclote river, abreast of the inlet, is a small stream running back about ten miles through the pine barren. Its entrance is obstructed by oyster bars, affording only a narrow, crooked pai>s for fishing boats. There are springs of fresh water about a mile up the river. Clearwater inlet affords twelve feet of water (at ordinary high tide) which can be carried up to the landing. A reef makes out about two miles on the west side of the inlet, curving a little east of north. Its north point is cleared by the range of a low pine and palmetto on the south end of Hog island. The best water is within thirty yards of the reef, and the channel is plain inside of it. Not more than six feet can be carried through St. Joseph's bay. The channel is very crooked and badly marked, and in some places not more than forty feet wide. The smallest coasters rarely attempt the passage through the lower part of the bay. There are no settlements on the coast between Bayport and Clearwater. A post office has lately been established at the latter place with a weekly mail to Cedar Keys. Only three families reside there. * * * * * * * * Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

APPENDIX No. 28.
EXTRACTS FROM THE REPORT OF SUB-ASSISTAKT N. S. FINNEY RELATING TO THE FLORIDA COAST AND WATERS NEAR BAYPORT. BRUNSWICK, Glynn County, Ga., Apri'.l 3, 1861. Sm: * * * The character of the topography and the coast generally are the same as described in my previous reports, consisting of a belt of low, soft marsh from one to three miles wide, bordered on the inside by dense forests of pine, palmetto, cedar, and oak, and on the outside by extensive mud flats and coral and oyster reefs. These extend in many places several miles into the Gulf of Mexico, and are cut up by numberless small creeks and baJous, the whole being nearly dry at low water, and the entire surface almost overflowed when the tide is in. Bayport, the only settlement immediately on the Gulf in the range of coast between Clearwater harbor and Cedar Keys, is situated at the junction of the W ekawatchee and Mud rivers, on a point of land or hammock, which is separated, in part, from the main land of the peninsula by a belt of marsh. During the summer the village is a favorite resort for the people of the interior, on account of its good air and for bathing and fishing. It contains about forty houses iu all, and in ordinary times about as many inhabitants. For some years a considerable trade has been carried on in cedar wood, large quantities being exported to New York for the manufacture of lead. pencils. The harbor at Bayport is of small capacity and very shallow, not admitting craft requiring over four and a half feet at ordinary high water. Vessels drawing twelve feet find safe anchor· age, with smooth water; near Beacon Rock signal, four miles west of Bayport. The navigfltion of the coast of Florida near Bayport is dangerous in the extreme, by reason of the sharp jagged rocks and reefs so profusely scattered about. These, in many cases, lie just below the surface at low water, rendering it imposi;ible to see them in time to avoid danger. * * * * * * * * * * With much respect, I am, your obedient servant, N. S.

D. C., May 1, 1861.

Sm:

East Bay (Galveston) shoals gradually for miles, and from its head, the mouth of East Bay bayou, to a distance of four miles to the west or southwest, a continuous soft black mud flat extends, covered at low tide with a few inches of water, and cut up with channels. The tide at the head of the bay is small, the north winds producing very low water, and the east and south winds high, depending upon their strength. After entering· the bayous over the flats a depth of from six to ten feet can be had for miles. Tho average width of these channels is only forty feet. General examinations have been made by parties interested in trade for connecting ihe

waters of the Sabine and East bay by a canal. The route proposed is by several bayous emptying into the former, and by a small cutting in the vicinity of East Bay bayou. The general direction of East Bay bayou is nearly parallel to the Gulf coast for about nine miles, and thence to the northward. Its average distance from the coast is less than three miles and a half. The bayou is supplied in part by others entering on both sides from the prairies which they drain. From the head of East bay to the High islands the land is low wet prairie, covered with pondR, and in many placeR impas;;;able for wagons. The Iligh islands are the only highlands on the Gulf shore, between Galveston island and the Sabine, and probably the highest on the coast of Texas. Some parts of them are heavily timbered, and all are susceptible of cultivation. Their elevation is from eighty to one hundred and fifty feet above high water, and their area about two thousand acres. The central point of the islands is about a mile and a quarter from the Gulf shore. From the High io;lands to the Sabine all is prairie; in some places impenetrable marsh to a breadth of seven miles in wet seasons. Small bayous run through in various directions, and enter into lakes or ponds. Firm land, at all seasons, cannot be found short of six to nine miles from the Gulf, and at many places not short of fifteen or twenty miles. * * * After passing High islands fresh water can be had only from ponds in the prairie or from wells dug near the sand hills along the Gulf shore. In very violent southerly winds nearly all the prairie, for some distance back from the shore, is covered by water from the Gulf. * * * * * * I have the honor to be, very reflpectfully, your obedient servant, G.

EXTRACTS FROM A REPORT BY S"CB ASSISTANT J. S. LA.WSON, SHOWING 'l'HE GENERAL CHARACTER OF KOOS BAY, OREGON.-(SKETcn No. 26)

U.S. C. S. BRIG R. H. FAUNTLEROY, Koos Bay, Oregon, &ptember 7, 1861. Sm: * * * * * * * * * * With the slight information which we had been able to pick up, before sailing from San Francisco, I declined to risk the vessel by entering Koos bay until some examination had been made of the bar and channel. This was done by the sailing master of the Fauntleroy; and in antiwer to the signal agreed upon, in case the depth of water should be found favorable, I ran the brig in. The least water we had was two and a half fathoms, it being half.flood as we passed in. Koos bay is very irregular in outline. Its general shape is somewhat like that of the letter U with the convexity to the northward. .A. number of sloughs make out from it, some of which are navigable a few miles for vessels drawing ten feet, but the passages are very narrow. Koos river empties into the head of the bay, and will admit boats to a distance of fifty miles from its mouth, where a small slough emptying into Coquille river is so near as to leave a portage of only a mile and a half between the two waters. Excepting the peninsula which skirts the ocean, from the entrance of the bay northward, the entire country is an immense forest of various species of the pine. No land for cultivation is found without clearing, and even the bottom lands on Koos river, which present very excellent soil, have to be clearerl of the thick growth of laurel, myrtle, and maple trees.

The bar off the harbor lies quite close to the en'xance, and at the lowest tides has not less than nine or ten feet of water. It is ahont a quarter of a mile wide from north to south, but considerably less from east to west. Vessels going either in or out do so on the flood tide, as the water is smoother then than it is on the ebb. Tlie currents run with great velocity, and the ebb causes a heavy break unless the sea is remarkauly smooth. The bar is a shifting one, moving to the northward in summer and soutlnvard in winter. It has moved con:;iderably to ihe northward since we ar-rived, in June. The north point of the entrance is a low sandy flat, across wl1ich was a narrow channel when we reached the bay, leaving then a tolerably large iRland. So much of this is now washed away that only a small patch is Reen at mean high water. At spri11g tideR it is entirely covered. Some chauge like this takes place every year, and the constant drifting of th13 sands must have a great effect in altering the channel and bar. Tho southern shore is a precipito11s rocky bluff, extending from the iuside of the entrance as far as Cape Gregory. This, of course, docs not change, but the beaches around it alter considerably. Places in which the bed rock is at times bare will, at others, be coYcred by several feet of sand, always, however, presenting bold sides to the clrnnnel inside of the rock which lies at the south side, and which has been known to be on low water mark. The channel in the hay presents a good depth of water. It passes along the western shore, and vessel::; sl10uld be careful to avoid being ,;et near the eastern ;;i.hore, al' several reefs make off from the rocky bluff which forms that side, oppo.;ite to and a mile ahoni the entrance. There is a rock, with nine feet at low water, the po,;ition of which "'ill be accurately determined and marked on the chart, if practicable, before the close of the season. A tugboat is employed at the entrance, saving much time in the passage of vessels in and out of the bay. The peninsula which separates the ba.\· from the ocea11 is composed entirely of sand, some of the hills on it attaining au elevation of a lmn<lred feet. The sand shifts so much, with strong winds, that in one case the part of a hill on which one of the signals had been set gained fifteen feet in height in the cour;,;e of a few weeks. The trade of Koos bay consist.R of lumber and coal. Of the former, the laurel, myrtle, &c., are extensively used on the 'Vestern Coast in the manufacture of furniture. There are at present two saw-mills in operation, capable of turning out about fifteen thousand feet per day. The coal is quite inferior a11d is not suited for steam vessels, but is much U8cd for stationary engines and for domestic purposes. * * * * * * Very respectfully, JAS. S. LAWSON, Sub-Assistant.

8, 18Gl. Sm: We arc in possession of this noule harbor, and the flag of the Union again floats over two places in South Caruliua. Commodore DuPont intended to resume the attack on Wedne,;day morning, but a violent gale from the westward prevailed until the afternoon of that (hty. TLe Wabash, with only auxiliary steam power, would have worked to great disadvantage in it., and yet, as every hour probably added to the strength of the enemy, whose work;; were foll iu our vim~·, to defer opening fire required moral courage in the commander of a higher degree than that called for in fighting. Our engine gave out on Wednesday, the 5th, in the morning, and it was not until near night that we were again in working order. The R. B. Forbe,,; came to me to say that the Augusta and D<tle, steam gunboat and sloop-of-war, were outside. I reported the fact to the commodore, and he expre,,;ticd KO earnest a witih to get them in before the attack that I determined to bring them in at ouce, t.lwugh uight lmd already come on. The Augusta draws 13 and the Dale 16 feet. "\Ve ran down about 8 p. m., and anchored a boat, with a Fresnel lantern in it, at the entrance of the channel. I then went to the two vessels aml communicated the corumodore's orders. Botl1 captains were rea·1.Y to go in if I would take the respon"3iuility of leauiug them. The Augusta took the Dale in to"~, and we pasl"ed in without trouble, having no cast lesR than 19 feet, and I had the satisfaction of reportiug to the flag-officer their arrival at half past eleven o'clock p. m. Running outside again I anchored the Yixen at the mi trance, in readiness to bring in the Ericcson ancl the Baltic, drawing 20 and 22 feet. The former vessel came off the tihoal on Wednesday, after thumping heavily, and lo,;ing five horses belonging to the general staff. At sunrise we anchored 11 large Bpar buoy at the entrance of the south channel. Mr. Platt and Mr. Jones, 1st and 2d officers of this vessel, were theu !"eut on board of the Baltic and Ericc8on, respectively, and l leJ in with the Yixen at half flood. "\Ve hacl no cast less than 27 feet, and I can say with ceTtainty that vessels drawing 25 feet may come in at all ordinary tides. The W nbnsh started for the batteries at 8. 30 a. m. She \Vas preceded by the Bienville, and followed by the Susquehanna, Mohican, Seminole, Pawnee, Poc-ahontas, Curle\\", Penguin, Augusta, Seneca, Ottawa, Unadilla, Pembina, Isaac Smith, Vandalia, (in tow of the Augusta,) and the R. B. Forbes. The sight was grand, and my only regret was that spw~ial duty ren· dered it imperative that we should not take part in the action. After anclioring the Baltic and Ericcson, I went on board of the Atlantic with General Sherman and witnessed the fight. The fleet sailed around in an ellipse, under slow steam, each vessel delivering its broadside as the guns were brought to bear. The Wabash, with her tremendous batteries of eight-inch guns on two decks, fairly reeled, as each division fired in succession. At the first turn tho fleet went so near that many shells passed over into the woods beyond. As tl1e vessels came around the second time they passed a little further out, and the shells went directly into and around tho works of the m10my. Gun after gun ceased firing on shore, until at last only one gun replied to the vessels. As the fleet was about coming around for the third time that gun also ceased, and the flag of the fort. came do1vn. Soon we saw a barge from the Wabash pulling in-shore with a flag of truce in her bow, and in a few minutes more the flag of the U 1Jited States was raised 011 shore. At the sight of it :-hout.,:: went up from the troops around us. The whole fleet of transports was soon in motion, and with bands playing and soldiers shouting the ves,;els passed i11to the bay aud anchored around the

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

On visiting the 'Vabash I found, to my utter surprise, that on board one man only had been killed and two wounded. In the entire squadron no officer was killed. The loss is about ten men killed and not many more wounded. The commodore at once sent five vessels over to Bay Point to engage the fort there; but tlie enemy had evacuated it in haste, leaving tents, clothing, and other species of personal property, as well as arms and ammunition. To-day I have been with General Sherman on a reconnaissance up Beaufort river and through Skull creek-the inland passage which leads from Port Royal sound to Savannah river· He does us the honor to say that a large share of the credit of the success here is due to the Coast Survey. Commodore DuPont desires mo to present his regards to you, and say that he will, as soon as possible, express his appreciation of our services, and thank you for the ard rendered by sending our party here. l\Ir. Platt, first officer of the Vixen, has afforded me very efficient aid in this whole matter. By skilful seamanship he saved the vessel from injury and probable loss in the fearful gale of Friday and Saturday last. By his knowledge of hydrographic work and his unceasing labor since we reached Port Royal, he has contributed in no small degree to our success. All the officers of the party in the Yixen deserve commendation for the manner in which each has added, in his sphere, to our successful work. I take especial ple:umre in mentioning the labors of .Mr. Willc11hucher, the hydrographic draughtsman of the Vixen. He made on the voyage three tracings of Hilton Head i~land, with the entire topography, for the generals of the expedition, and has sketched a view of the battle, which will be sent to you when completed.

T. ,· COAST SURVEY OFFICE, Augu.sl 21, 1861.

270

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT U. S. COAST SURVEY.

Washington Territory, or for buoys to mark the bar and channel, I have ilie honor to transmit in reply the following extracts from a report made by Sub-Assistant James S. Lawson. To these will be added the conclusions of Capt. C. P. Patterson, chief of the hydrographic office, whose experience and intimate acquaintance with the requirements of trade and commerce on the western coast are such as to entitle bis opinion to great weight in any question like the one now presented. :Mr. Lawson says : "The only possible good a light-house could serve at Gray's harbor would be to mark out its position, and this can be done well enough by the one at Shoahvater bay; but for some reason the light at Shoalwater has been discontinued, and possibly is not yet restored, though there is a much larger population there, and a great deal more trade, than at Gray's harbor. The mud flats are so extensive that at least nine-tenths of the bottom of the harbor is bare at low water. The trade merely amounts to bringing the supplies needed by a few settlers, and by the military post on Chehalis river. These, in all, during seven months of lai:lt year, reached only one hundred and twenty-five tons. There are no export.;, the difficulty of approaching the shores being such as to hinder the development of any trade in lumber as yet, though the shores arc heavily wooded. ''The interests of settlers at Gray's harbor will be better Rerved by the placing of buoys to mark the bar, and the channel iuto the bay, as also that leading fro111 tho entrance of the harbor to Point Hanson and the north channel. I would also recommend that a buoy be placed on the ernl of the south spit, 1Yhere the water probaLly breaks during heavy winter weather as much as four and fiye miles off :,;hore. The buoys should be like those at Columbia river, and should be well secured.'' Captain Patterson remark~ as follows : " In regard to the question of erecting a light-house at Gray's harbor, I fully :.igree with the reaRons and conclusion of l\[r. Lawson. A light-house there is, at present, and will be for many years, totally unnecessary. Tlie interests of the small local trade will Le best securetl, as suggested by Mr. Lawson, by the placing of proper buoys. The buoy recommended by him fur the end of the south spit would be of great service to the coasting steamers." Fully concurring in the conclusion reached by Captain P<ttterl'1on and Mr. Lawson, that it is inexpedient to erect a light-house at Gray's harbor, I would respectfully rmggest that a copy of this communication may be furnished to the Light-House Board, so as to place on file the recommendations in regard to buoys.
