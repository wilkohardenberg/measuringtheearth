U. S.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., December 10, 1888. SIR : In accordance with law and with the regulations of the Treasury Department, I have the houor to submit herewith a report of the progress and state of the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey during the fiscal year which ended June 30, 1888, with a view to the same being laiJ. before the President and Congress. The report is accompanied by a map of general progress, upon which is shown graphically the advance made in tl10 several operations of the survey up to the close of the fiscal yC'ar. As the scale of this map does not admit of sllowing the extended coast line of Alaska, a separate map exhibits the progress of tlie work in that Territory. Duri11g the past ,rear the work has made most satisfactory progress in every direction of its developmeut as a geodetic survey, intended for purposes of commerce and defense upon the coasts of the United States, aml intended also to establish accurate bases for State surveys by chains of triangulation so connected as to form "a frame work into which all local surveys must rigor· ously fit." To complete the work upon the Atlantic and Gulf coasts there are still needed surveys and investigations, which, though less urgently demanded than have bf.'en others of more immediate bearing upon the interests of commerce and navigation, are yet essential to a complete survey of the coasts of the United States. These are chiefly the finishiug of the snr'l'ey of the coast of Maine to the Northeastern Bound· ary; the continuation of the investigations in physical hydrography relating to harbors and bars, with special reference to the study of shoal formations, the laws governing the action of currents, and the movement of ice audits effect upon navigation; the continuation of off-shore soundings in the North Atlantic, and of current awl temperature observations in the Gulf Stream; the con. tinuation of the survey of the western coast of Florida between Cape Sable and Cape Romano; the rnrveys of Pensacola an1l Perdido Bays and their tributaries, and their connection with the main triangulation; the survey of Lake Pontchartrain and of the coast of Louisiana from Barataria Bny to Sabine Pass, with such off-shore hydrograpby as may be required; the connection of points on the Gulf of Mexico by lines of geodetic leveling with the transcontinental line of level· ing of precisiou, aud the survey of the Rio Grande River to the head of ship navigation. From time to time there will be needed a.lso such resurveys as may be demanded to determine local changes in important harbors or highways of commerce an<l to keep the charts and coast pilots corrected to date. For geodetic pur11oses there will be needed a line of primary triangulation which shall connect the triangulations upon the coasts of North or South Caroliua with the primary triangulation along the Blue Ridge, a line which shall complete the connection of the triangulations on the east and west coasts of Florida by a series of triangles betw<>en Fernandina aud Oe1lar Keys, and a line 'Yhicn shall finish the connection between the main triangulation in Northern Georgia and Alabama. and that of the Gulf of Mexico. The measurement just named is now well advauced; its com1Jletion will carry an oblique arc of the meridian from t.he northeastern boundary to the Golt~ and will supply data of special value iu detRrmining the elements upon which depend our knowledge of the size and figure of the earth.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY..

The sketch of general progress shows the belt of triangulation upon the results of which the measurement of this arc depends; it shows also a belt, now advancing towards completion, between the head of Chesapeake Bay and Lake Ontario, by which the Pamplico-Chesapeake·Lake Ontario arc of the meridian will be carried four degrees farther north. It will be observed by an inspection of the map that the purposes of geodesy will he suhserved, and the more immediately practical results required in the State surveys will be securedi as progress is made in tlle lines of transcontinental triangulation, projected to connect the work on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Upou the completion of these lines, two arcs of the parallel will have been measured, one between Cape May and Point Arena, the other between Cape Hatteras and San Luis Obispo. Incidentally there will have been determined geographical positions and elevations abo\'e sea level in twenty-one States and four Territories; the location of the principal meri· dians of the General Land Office will have been checked by precise measurements, and means furnished for accurate determinations of State boundaries. The northernmost of these lines, that on or near the thirty-ninth parallel, bas now so far advanced that its early completion is looked forward to. Whrn the measurement of this arc of the parallel of forty-nine aegrees-the longest ever obtained-can be combined with the measurement of a central arc of the meridian, carried along or near the ninety-ninth degree from the Rio Grande to the northern boundary, geodesy will have secured the data desired to determine the elements of the spheroid best adapted for discussing the final results of the geodetic survey of the United States. Upon the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington Territory, the survey has so far advanced that charts of all the more important harbors and anchorages have been published, and by these, and b,v the views and descriptions of the Coast Pilots, their approaches and entrances are well known to navigators. .Much work remains to be done in the triangulation and topography of the less important stretches of coast, and much of the off-shore hydrography and observation of ocean currents. The primary triangulation near the coast in California, Oregon, and WaslJington Territory should be completed and connected with the transcontinental triangulation, and such primary bases of >erification measured as may be necessary. Tbe survey of the Columbia River should be carried from the mouth of the Willamette to the Cascadei;i, and the transcontinental line of levels of 11recision should be pushed eastward from San Francisco. Such determinations of gravity and the magnetic clements should he made upon the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and in the interior as the progress of the survey requires. While changes from natural causes are perhaps less frequent upon tbe Pacific coast than upon the .Atlantic, tlJose from artificial causes occur quite as often. Resurveys have lately been demanded of two of the most important harbors, San Francisco and San Diego. An arc of the meridian of the Pacific is now in course of development on or near the one hundred and twenty-third degree of longitude by the triangulation partly completed between Monterey Bay and the Gulf of Georgia. In Alaska, the more detailed surveys have been confined to those sections of the coast the resources of which have had during late years such rapid development. Immediately upon the acquisition of the territory, a geographical reconnaissance was carried from Sitka to Unalashka Island, and detached surveys have since been made as far west as the Pribiloft' Islands in Bering Sea. Recent estimates give for the coast line of Alaska from the Archipelago .Alexander to the Cbichagoff Islands, a length of seven thousand eight hundred and forty miles, and from the Chichagoff shore of Icy Strait westward to Point Barrow, Wrangell Island, and Herald Island, a length of eighteen thousand five hundred and twenty-four miles, making in all twenty-six thousand three hundred and sixty-four miles, which is but three thousand six hundred and forty miles less, according to the same estimates, than the entire Pacific coast line of the United States. The n:ap shows that good progress has been made in suneys and explorations in the Alexander Archipelago, between Dixon Entrance and Cross Sound, and that the coast line has been delineated from near Cape Spencer to Icy .Bay. Other localities are indicated where detached. surveys have been made.

By recent Congressional enactment,· a preliminary survey of the frontier line between Alaska and British Oo1umbia in accordance with p1ans or projects approved by the Secretary of State has been placed in charge of this Bureau. Such a preliminary 1mrvey, involving the determination of a number of points in geographical position and their complete marking by permanent monuments, will have to be carried from Cape l\fuzon through the Portland Canal to the fifty-sixth degree of north latitude, thence northwestwardly, following as nearly as may be practicable the general trend of the coast, at a distance of about thirty-five miles from it, to the one hundred and fortyfirst degree of west longitude, and thence due north to the Arctic Ocean, a total distance of about fourteen hundred miles. Part I of this report gives a summary of the leading operations of the Survey during the year, followed ·by general statements of progress in field and office work, br notices of discoveries and developments and of special scientific work, by notices of bulletins, the publication of wbich was begun during the year, and by an explanation of estimates and estimates in detail for 1889-'90. Part I [ begins with an introductory statement, relating mainly to the offices of the Assistant in charge and the Hydrographic Inspector; it then presents abstracts of tho reports of chiefs of field parties arranged in a geographical order, concluding with a notice of special operations, a summary statement ofoffice O}lerations, including those of the sub-offices at Philadelphia and San Francisco, and a final statement by the Superintendent.

PART I.

During the past fiscal year the scale upon which the work has been prosecuted has been fully commensurate with the means afforded by Congress. Surveys invoh'ing triangulation and topography, astronomical and magnetic observations, determinations of elevations by lines of geodetic leveling, audobservations for the value of gravity were carried on witliin the limits or upon tbe coasts of twenty-one States, three Territories, and in the District of Columbia. Ilydrograpliic surveys, including observations of tides and currents, off-shore and inshore soundings, observations of ice movement, and researches in physical bydrogrHpby relating to harbors and bars, were prosecuted in the waters or off the coasts of fifteen States and two Territories. Tue necessity for connecting the extended series of triangulations of the Survey with other works of similar character carried on by independent organizations and methods was not lost sight of. Upon the northeastern coast of ..Maine, the connection of the island of Grand Manan with the J>rimary triangulation, and the advance towar1ls completion of the triangulation of the St. Croix Rirnr will ultimately join the <Joast and Geodetic Survey work with the surveys of the Dowiuion of Canada and with the Northeastern Boundary Survey, which will tlms afford a check to the coast triangulation. In Wisconsin, the geodetic operations in progress have effected another junction with the work of the U. S. Lake Survey, one having been previously made by the triangulation crossing the State of New York. In Indiana and Illinois, the transcontinental triangulation, advancing eastward near the thirty-ninth parallel, has been connected with the second and third princi1ml meridians of the General Land Office. The accurate determinations of geographical positions made in the progress of the work, according to the most approved methods of modern geodesy, whether on the coast or in the interior, continue to be freely communicated to the Geological Sur>ey, and serve to check the approximate positions obtained in the course of its preliminary tri· angulations. Among the more important field operations of the year may be mentimhid the combined observations of precise leveling, and of tl1e direction and velocity of currents for ascertaining the successive tidal levels in New York Ilarhor and the relation of the under-run of the Hudson River totbe New York Bar; the contiuuation of the study of ice formation ancl movement in Delaware River and Bay; the prosecution of the explorations of the Gulf Stream; the advance towards complet.ion of the triangulation neede<l to extenu the oblique arc of the meridian from Calais, Maine, to Mobile, .Ala.bama, and to unite the triangulations of the Atlantic aml Gulf coasts; the ell.tension of the line of transcontinental leveling from the Mississippi H.iver to Little Rock, Arkansaiq shore· line resurveys of important harbors on the Pacific coast; determinations of gra\'ity at San Francisco and Mount Hamilton, California, and at Washington, D. C., in connection with similar determinations made on the Hawaiian Islands, and progress made in the surveys of harbors and channels in southeastern Alaska. The special triangulation asked for by the Commissioners of the topographical survey of the State of Massachusetts was continued; geodetic work in co-operation with State gt-,ological or topographical surveys was carried on in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Tennel!See, Arkansas, Wisconsin, and Minnesota; additional determ111ations of geographical positions were made by the longitude parties on the Pacific slope.

By direction of the Secretary of the Treasur,Y and at the request of the Secretary of State, a special examination and survey was made of the boundary line between the United States aud Oana<la in the vicinity of Burnt Island, Lake Huron. In co-operation with the District Commissioners, unusually ra11id progress was made in the <letailed topographical survey of the District of Columbia. The geodetic work on the Hawaiian Islands, already referred to, was done by an officer of the Survey, detailed for that purpose hy direction of the Secretary of the Treasury and granted leave without pay during the operations, which were undertaken at the request and expense of the Hawaiian Government.

States and Canada at Burnt Island, Lake Huron, and the completion of the determinations of latitude, and gravity upon tlie Hawaiian Islands, made by an officer of the SurYey at the request and sole expense of the Hawaiian Government, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury II.-OFFICE·WORK. Special attention was given during the year in the office of the Survey to the prompt publication of results of immediate value to the interests of commerce and na\"igation. Reference to the notices to mariners issued from time to time is ma<le under the followi11g heading. The free distribution of upwards of thirty-five thousand copies of these notices shows that care was taken to disseminate widely information of disco,eries or developments made in the progress of the work. Tide tables, predicting for the year 1889 the times and heights of high and low water at all the principal ports on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, were pnl>lislied. From the times and heights at the chief ports, those for minor ports and harbors can be deduced by tidal differeuce8 and ratios. A new Catalogue of Charts was published, with index maps, showing the limits of the charts; also a new volume of the Atlantic Local Coast l'ilot, covering the coast from 'l'ybee Roads to Jupiter Inlet. A third edition of snbdi,isions G and 7 (in one volmne), including the coast from Cape Ann to Monomoy, was in press at the close of the ~·ear, and a new Coast Pilot volume, covering the coast from Point Judith to the East River, was practicall,v completed at that date. The drawings of sixteen new charts were finished, and those of one hundred and twelve charts were iu hand to receive additions and corrections for the preparation of new editions and for completion. Twelve new charts wert:J eugraYed and the engravings of new editions often charts were finished. Twelve uew charts were published from engraved 1>lates and eleven from photolithogra1lhs.· The total number of charts printed <luring the year was forty-four thousand and ninety-three. Of this 1mmber twenty-five thousand two hundred and seventy-three were sent to sale agents, two thousand four lrnndred and eighty-three supplied for the use of Congress, and eleven thousand six hundred and eight for the sm·eral Executive Departments. Distribution was made llS heretofore of the Annual Reports of the Survey and the appendices to the same, of which extra editions were printed to meet the usual demands from educational and scientific institutions an<l the public. The annual report of the Assistant in charge of the Office and Topography, which appears as Appendix No. 4 to this volume, gives full details of the progress made in the work of the office during the year. A summary of this report will be found towards the close of Part II.
m.-DISCOVERIES AND DEVELOPMENTS.

Discoveries and developments made iu the progress of the survey which have a close bearing upon the interests of navigation and commerce ;tre published at the earliest <late practicable in the form of Notices to Mariners. Since the beginning of the fiscal year a series of these notices bas been published monthly in pursuance of a suggestion made by the Hydrographic Inspector. These monthly notices give a11 important corrections made on tbe charts during the month preceding their issue, including all changes in buoys, beacons, or lights, and references to any special notices that may ha\·e appeared; also lists of charts suspended or condemned and new charts issued. Special notices, giving information of immediate value to mariners, are published as occasion may demand. An abstract by number, date, and title of the fifteen notices published during the year is here given. Thirty-five thousand ftve hundred copies were printed for free distribution: No. 89, 1887, July 30. Chart corrections during the month of July, 1887. No. 90, 1887, August 31. Chart corrections during the month of August, 188i. No. 91, 1887, September 30. Cha.rt corrections during the month of September, 1887.
·In addition to the eleven cha.rts published by photolitbography, and already received in the chart-room, there were on June 30, 1888, in the hands of the photolithographer, complete for publication, the drawings of twenty ebarta, the work upon which should be c.redited to the fiscal year 1887-'8$.

Among the references to new publications in No. 103 is one to a series of papers under the tit1e of Bulletins, the first number of which had been recently published. Further reference to the bulletins appears under the next heading.

IV.-BULLETDJS.
In May, 1888, in pursuance of a suggestion made by the Hydrograpbic Inspector and ap· proved hy the Superintendent, the publication of a serie!l of papers under the clesignatiou of Bulletins was decided upon. Their purpose is stated in the following explanatory note, which accompanies each bulletin: Papers published hy the Survey under this designation will appear from time to time as material for them accumulates. They are intended to give early an· nouncement of work accomplished or information of importanc,e obtained, and will in many cases anticipate the usual means of publication afforded by the annual reports. The pages will be numbered consecutively, and will be indexed when their number demands it, thus augmenting their value for preservation and reference. Before the close of the fiscal year the manuscripts of fh'e bulletins bad been 1mbmitted for publication, approved aml revised for the printer. Two of these were published; No. I, May 14, under title "Recent Publications;'' No. 2, Jmw 20, ';Notes on Alaska from recent surveys."

V.-SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC WORK.
THE VJ.LUE OF '.l'HE "ARCANO DEL MARE" WI'l'H REFERENCE TO OU& KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION IN THE EARLIER PART OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.

The discovery of a work apparently overlooked hitherto, gi viug, for au epoch near tlJe first third of the seventeenth century, values of the magnetic declinatiou for all regions then known to the navigator, led Assistant Schott to examine carefully with a view to ascertain the trustworthiness of its data and their bearing upon the secular variation of the magnetic needle in North America and adjacent regions. This work, published in Florence, Italy, in 1646, under the title" Dell' Arcano del Marf'," beca.me known to the Survey through Justin Winsor's" Narrative and Critical History of North Amerfoa, 1886," and by the courtesy of Mr. Winsor, in his capacity as librarian of Harvard University, a copy was t;emporarily placed at the disposal of the office. In Appendix No. 6 Mr. Schott gives the results of his examinations of the declinations for North America. and adjacent regions which are recorded in the Arcano, referring to the method adorttetl in that work for ascertaining the longitude at sea by means of the observed cbangei;i in the magnetic declination-though not a method original with this author, botb.Colnmbus in the fifteenth century and Sebastian Cabot in the sixteenth, having anticipated him in suggesting it. The second volume contains a series of charts notable for their boldness of outline and clearn~ of expre.ssioo. In the illustration (No. 19) which accompanies hit1 paper, Mr. S<lhott has shown graphically the declinations given in the Arcano for North America at tbeestimat.ed epooh, 1630, plus or minus ten

years, with the agonic or isogonic lines for that epoch, and in illustration (No. 20) he shows the secular change in the position of the agonic line of the North Atlantic hetween 1500 antl 1900, as derived from comparisons of Hansteen's and Halley's data with those of the Arcano and with mod· ern observations.
THE SECULAR VARIATION OF '£HE MAGNETIC NEBDLE IN THE UNITED STATES AND AT SOME FOREIGN STATIONS (SEVENTH EDITION).

But a few words are needed to explain the necessity for the publication of a seventh edition of the paper by Assistant C. A. Schott 011 the Secular Variation of the Magnetic Needle in the United States and at some foreign stations. (Appendix No. 7.) Apart from the constant and increasing demand for tl1is paper, the additions to the material for discussion and analysis derived from observations are of so marketl a character as greatly to improve many of the expressions given in the preceding edit,ionf;. These additions consisted main ls in bringing to ligbt a number of variatio:is recorded in the Arcano del Mare (inst referred to), and in the discovery of a number of records of the variation off the coast of Lower California made by a French officer in t.he year 1714. There is also urgent need of the issue of the map showing lines of equal mngnetic declination for the epoch 1800 in the United Stat~s. The value of this map must depend mainly on the accuracy with which the secular variation of the magnetic decli11ation is known.
GEOGRAPHICAL POSITIONS IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT,

In pursuance of the plan of publishing from time to time the geographical positious determined by the Survey in ea.ch State, there are ghren iu Appendix No. i:I the complete geodetic results of the various triangulations made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey iu tl1e State of Connecticut. (See illustration No. 28.) Similar results for the States of Massachusetts and Rhode Island were pull· lisbed iu Appendix No. 8 to the report of 1885. For the State of Connecticut, the latitudes, longitudes, and other geodetic data are giwn for eight hundred and seventeen trigonometrical points, determined between the years 1833 and 1886. All have been treated systematically and adjusted to the present standarll data, geodetic and astronomical. On account of the large number of separate field parties, and the consequent interlacing of 1mrtial triangulations, the work of computaticn was one of great magnitude. Resurveyl'l of large portions of the coast had to be made, being required by the physical changes during half a century, as well as by the demand for greater minuteness in the surveys of more recent years.
TIDAL LEVELS AND FLOW OF CURRENTS IN NEW YORK BAY AND HARBOR.

Data derived from extended series of tidal observations, made in 1886, and from heights of tidal bench· marks determined by lines of precise leveling in 1886 ancl 1887, have enabled Assistant Henry L. Marindin to show graphically the movements of the tide in filling and draining the tidal reservoirs surrounding New York City, and the flow of currents at successive periods of the tide. Mr. Marindin's paper on this suhject is published as Appemlix No. 9 to this volume. The twelve diagrams which illustrate it (Nos. 29-40) gh'e vertical cross·sections oftbe height of the tide above or below the line of mean sea-level at Sandy Hook (the datum line) for each lunar hour after the moon's transit, thus showiug at intervals of about six:ty.. two minutes of civil time the eleYations or depressions of the several tidal basins of the Hudson, the East River, and New York Bay as compared with Sandy Hook. Near low water, or at 0 hour, as wm ap1>lmr from an inspection of these diagrams, and the tables given in the report, the level of the sea at Sandy Hook is very nearly 5 fl·et below the level of the water at Willets Point, East River. Near high water, or at VI hour, these conditions are reversed, the sea-level at Sandy Rook being about 5.4: feet higher than the level of the water at Willet's Point. The results presented in this paper will contribute to the solution of many questions relating to the respective values of the bays and flats in and about New York Harbor as tidal reservoirs in maintaining tbe channel ways through Sandy Hook, and keeping unimpaire1l the approaches to the '1hief commercial city of the United States.

HEIGHTS FROM SPIRIT-LEVELING OF PRECISION BETWEEN MOBILE, ALABAMA, AND OKOLONA, MISSISSIPPI; BE'.rWEEN NEW ORLEANS, LGUISIANA, AND WILKERSON'S LANDING, MIS8IS· SIPPI, OPPOSITE ARKANSAS CITY, ARKANSAS, AND BETWEEN ARKANSAS CITY AND J,..ITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS.

In the year 1884 tbe method of running two parallel lines of geodetic lenling Himultancously, alternate sections being ruu in opposite directiomi, was found to give results which failed to furnish the complete or independent check and standard of accuracy required for this branch of the Survey; it was therefore abandoued, and for it was substituted the plan of running two indepen· dent lines, one forward, the other backward, the work beiug carried on as often as practicable b_y different observers, using different instruments. The results of lines of leveling of precision, run from Mobile, Alabama, to Okolona, Mississippi; from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Wilkerson's Landing, opposite Arkansas City, Arkansas, and from Arkansas City (on Mississippi Ri\·er) to Little Rock, Arkansas, are discussed by Assistant Schott in Appendices Nos. 10, 11, and 12, to this volume. The first named line was run in the years 1884, 1886, and 1887, the old method being employed in 1884, and the new one in 1886 and 1887. The second line referred to was run in 1879, 1880, and 1881 by officers of the Survey be· tween New Orleau::i and Greenville, Missisi<ippi, and by the Mississippi River Commission in 1880 and 1881 between Greenville and Wilkerson's Landing, opposite ~.\.rkansas City, Arkansas, on the Mississippi River. Between Arkansas City and J,ittle Rock, Arkansas, the leveling was done in 1887 and 1888. For all of the heights deduced in the discussion; the plane of reference adopted is the mean le\·el of the Gulf of Mexico, as determined by tidal observations at Biloxi, Mississippi, and carried forward by the results of geodetic leniling in 1885 and 1886 between Mobile and New Orleans. (See Appendix No. 9, report for 1887.) The 11rirnary beuch-rnark at St. Louis, Missouri, of the line of transcontinental geodetic leveling, near the thirty-ninth parallel, has already bee11 connected by lines of leveling of precision with the Gulf mean level at Biloxi, Mississippi, the work having been done partJy by this Survi>y, partl_y by the Mississippi River Commission, aud partly by the United States Engineers. A more direct line, aud a check connection through Mobile, Alabama, Meridian and Okolona, Mississippi, will be obtained as soon as one additional link in the chain can be completed-that between Okolona, Uississippi, and Cairo, Illinois.
DU'FERENTIAL METHOD OF COMPUTING APPARENT PLACES OF STARS FOR DETERMINATIONS OF LATITUDE.

In order to shorten the time and lessen the labor of computing the apparent declinations of stars obser>ed for latitude when quite a number of stations had been occupied during the season, Mr. E. D. Preston, Assistant, made an investigation looking to the introduction of a differential

method.

Upon application of this method to the reduction of star places for fourteen stations occupied during 1887, it was found much preferable to the usual logarithmic one. An account of it, with examples of the two methods for comparison, was prepared by Mr. Preston, and is published as Appendix No. 13 to this volume.
DETERMINATIONS OF LATITUDE .AND GRAVITY FOR 'l'HE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT.

In the course of the triangulation of the Ilawaiian Islauds carried on under the direction of Prof. "\V. D. Alexander, Surveyor-General for the Hawaiian Government, certain discrepancies appeared between the astronomical and geodetic determinations of latitude, which indicated on· usually large deflections of the plumb-line. It was deci<led therefore by the Hawaiian Government to ask the co-operation of the United States in establishing a number of latitude stations upon the four principal islands of the group, these stations to be so distributed north and south of the high mountains as to develop the amounts of deflection of the plumb·line. The latitude deter·

minations were to be supplemented by determinaticms of the force of gravity at a station on top of · one of the highest mountains, at a station at the sea-level, and at a station on Ilonoluln. This project having met with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. E. D. Preston, of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, was detailed by the Superinteudeut to execute it. Assistant Preston's full antl comprehensiye report of his methods of observation and the results of his work appears in Appeudix 14 of this volume. The illustrations wl1ich accompany it add to its value as a paper of geueral scientific interest-one that has been referred to by high scientific authority as affording unexpected evidence on the douutful questions relating to the density of volcanic mountains.
EXPLANATION OF ESTIMATES.

The estimates submitted to the Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890, were accompanied by the following statement:
"U.S. COAS'l' AND
GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

" Washington, September 21, 1888. Sm: In transmitting for your approval the estimates of the appropriations reqnirecl for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Suney for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890, I have the honor to submit the following explanation : Exclusive of tbe estimates for printing and bindmg, which arc tbe same each ;rear, the aggre· gate of the estimates ($575:950) is larger than that for the current year ($559,885), an increase which is more tllan accounted for by the single item of $25 7000 for the preliminary survey of the boundary of Alaska (frontier line between Alaska and British Columbia), a work originally estimated for by tbe Hon. Secretary of State, but which Congress has dfrected to be done by this Survey. With the Alaska boundary item omitted, these estimates would aggregate $8,935 less than those for the current year. For the considerations which have governed the estimates for field-work I respectfully refer you to my letter transmitting estimates for the fiscal year ending June 3(), 1888 (Appendix Gg, page 291, Book of Estimates), in which suc·h consideratious are given in detail. For a full explanation of the class of expenditures mentioned as "party expenses," as well as the items in relation to the International Geodetic Association for the Measurement of the Earth, and in relation to a slight increase in the force of the computers, draughtsmen, and en· gravers, which matters have already been explained to and acted upon by Congress, I respectfully refer to my letter of October 6, 1887, transmitting the estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1889 (Appendix Ii, page 312, Book of' Estimates). Of the increased estimates for "pay of office force," $2,000 is due to a transfer of an item for a computer in "publishing observations" to "chief accountant" under the head of "office force." The residue of such increase ($3,065) is due to estimates for a few deserved promotions, for a change of ·a messenger to a clerkship, and for payment of regular salaries for two additional map-colorists, whose necessary work has heretofore been paid for out of the item for "extra labor 71 under the sub-bead of" office expenses," with the result of embarrassingly restricting the fund available for the remaining items of the paragraph "for miscellaneous expenses, contingencies, office furniture, repairs, etc.," as well as for the "extra labor," upon which constantly increasing demands are made in the furnishing of charts, tracings, drawings, soundings, and a great variety of data and information to the Engineers, U. S. Army, the Hydrographic Office, Navy Department, the Geo· logical Survey, and other departments and bureaus of the Government, State, and municipal offi· cers and individr1als. · An increase of $6,000 is estima.t~d for in the second paragraph of the "office expenses," in order to render 1><>ssible the continuance of adequately prompt publication of tbe charts of tbe Survey, as explained to you in my letter of January 20, 1888, transmitting a so-called '' deficienc_y estimate" for a similar purpose. Respectfully yours, F. M. THORN, Superintendent. The SECRET.Un OF 1'.BE TRlU.SUBY.

PART II.

Beginning at the St. Croix River, Maine, and following the Atlantic and Gulf coasts to the Rio Grande, and beginning at San Diego and following a reversed geographical order on the Pacific coast, tl!is iiart of tile report contains abstracts of field-work derived from the reports of the chiefs of parties, including also those engaged in the States I.Ying between the Atlantic and l'acific. kppeu<lix No. 1 presents in tabular form the several sections into which, for convenience of reference, the coast and interior has been divided, states the nature of the several classes of work, the names of the officers in charge of field parties, and the localities of their surveys. Notices of special operations and of the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office and the sub-offices at Philadelphia and San Francisco follow. The charge of the Office has been continued with Assistant B. A. Colonna. His annual report (Appendix No. 4) is accompanied by the reports of the chiefs of the several Office divisions. Mr. Colonna, in closing bis report, alludes to tbe high state of efficiency that bas been maintained in the Office, and t·xpresses his tllanks to the chiefs of the respective divisions and their subordinates. He acknowledges also the cordial co-operation of the H;ydrographic Inspector and the naval officers associated with hiIIL Appendix No. 2 gives the statistics of field and office work of the Survey for the fiscal year, and a summation of those statistics to June 30, 1888. Appendix No. 3 pre~mnts in tabular form for the :year the names of persons, associations, or Departments of the Government to whom in· formation has been furnished, with a statement of the data or information supplied. The great increase in the work of requests for transcripts of the records and,Priginal surveys, both from official and personal sources in recent years, is one evidence of the increase in usefulness of the work and of a wider appreciation of the value of its results on the part of the public. Lieut. Commander W. H. Brownson, U. S. N., has continued on duty as Ilydrographic In· spector of the SurYey. In his annual report (Appendix No. 5) he reviews the progress of the several classes of hydrographie work upon the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, refers to the advance made in the preparation of the Coast Pilot, and to the labors of the Hydrographic Division, states the condition of the vessels of the Survey, and makes recommendations for their repair, and submits suggestions for examinations and resurve.ys required to keep the charts up to date. Uuder the general direction of the Hydrographie Inspector the duties of the Coa'st Pilot Division, which in\'Ol"ved the execution of work both in the field and in the office, remained in charge of Lieut. George H. Peters, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic SurYey. The annual report of this officer accompanies the report of the Hydrographic Inspector. The collection, revision, and verification of data as carried on in the field is reported under headings in Sections I and II of the coast. A part of the large volume intended to include the whole of the Atlantic coast on a plan devised by Lieutenant Peters, bas been put to press. This part includes the coast from Point Judith to the East l~iver, and will be published as a special issue. Other portions of this volume are in active preparation, and those most in demand will appear at as early a date as practicable. Subdivision No. 21, Atlantic Local Coast Pilot, Tybee R-0ads to Jupiter Inlet (first edition), and Subdivisions Nos. G and 7, Oape Ann to Monomoy (third edition, in one volume), were published. Ensign William J. Maxwell, U. S. N., was engaged in both field and office duty in the Coast Pilot Division up to the date of his detachment from the Snrvey, November 20,l887. Ensign Edwin H. Tillmau, U. S. N., served throughout the year; and as recorder and compiler, l\fr. John Ross. After April 18, 1888, the charge of the Hydrogra.phic Division devolved upon

Lieutenant Peters in the absence of its chief. Upon his leaving the office for field duty, in May, Mr. Tillman had immediate charge of the details of the office work of both the Coast Pilot and Hydrographic Di>isions until the close of the fiscal year. . -The annual report of the Hydrographic Division is submitted by Lieut. M. L. Wood, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, who was in charge until temporarily detached, in April, 1888, for hydrographic duty in the vicinity of Cape Charles, Virginia. Lieutenant Wood calls attention to a change made in the system of supplying corrections to charts and in correcting copies of charts for issue wherehy material reduction bas been accomplished in the liability to error and in the labor of 4J.Pplying corrections. He suggests tbe possibility of making arrangements for printing the monthly Notices to :Mariners and such occasional notices as are needed, in the office building, so as to shorten the time now required between the date of sending copy to the printer and the date of issue. A large amount of work was completed during the year by the hydrographic draughtsmen attached to the Di>ision, Messrs. E. ·wmenbucher, W. C. Willenbucher, F. C. Donn, and by Mr. E. H. Wyvill, who were assigned as bydrographic draughtsmen December 10, 1887. Tabular statements of their work accompany the report. The clerical work in the Hydrographic Inspect-Or's office was performed by Messrs. George J. Vestner, R. E. King, and W. H. Lanman until January 9, 1888, when Mr. J. H. Roeth was assigned to this duty. In the Coast Pilot Division, Miss Glova B. Bower was temporarily assigned to duty as copyist in April, 1888, and her work proving to be satisfactory she was employed in that capacity as a part of the office force from May 1. Appended to Lieutenant Commander Rrownson's report are lists of officers of the Navy on duty in the Survey during the fiscal year, with dates of assignment and detachment, lists of naval officers attached to the Survey June 30, 1888, a list showing the number of naval officers attached to the several vessels and on office duty September 30, 1887, aud March 19, 1888, and tabular statements of the number of men in service on Urn vessels at four different dates during the fiscal year, and of the names of the vessels, their tonnage, and complements of officers and men.

Triangulation of Gobscook Ba.y, Maine, and of the St. Croix River, from the primary triangulation near its mouth towards the Imtial Monument of the. Northeastern Boundary at its source.-At the beginning of the fiscal year, Assistant C. H. Boyd had Ileen in the field with his party since May 19, 1887, engaged in the triangulation of the north shore of Oobscook Bay, under instructions issaed in April of that year. Two stations, in the towns of Edmonds and Pembroke, had been selected as forming a suitable base for beginning the work, these points having been carefully marked by copper bolts sunk into rocky ledges when first occupied in 1860. But upon reaching the field neither statiDa-could be found; the bolts had been broken out of the ledges, and in so doing the rock crushed and all traces of the drill holes destroyed. Other station-marks searched for had similarly disappeared, so that ultimately the work had to be started from the line Carr-Little of 1866, and having been prosecuted without interruption until Angnst, it was closed upon the station Prince Regent's Redoubt in Eastport. On the northern shore of Cobscook Bay forty-five geographical positious were located in the towns of Edmonds, Dennysville, Pembroke, Perry, Eastport, and Lubec, intended to supply fully the needs of the topographic and hydrographic parties soon to follow. In August the triangulation along the St. Croix River was taken up from the primary base Oooper-Chamcoolt:. Station St. David's, formerly de\iermined from this line, had disappeared, the owner of the land having removed the station-mark and built a house over it. Prince Regent's Redonbt was therefore occupied, and the work pushed northward at every available opportunity. Usually, in this locality, the months of September and October afford the best long.line seeing of the year, northwest winds clearing a.way the fogs, but this year these winds brought clomls of dense smoke from forest 1lres in Oa.nada., so that the obS&Vati-0ns were greatly delayed. ·

A line of levels ,-as then run from this bench-mark to the station ou Uhamcook. It b<:.ing late in the season when this work was llll(lertakeu, Mr. Bo.rd acknowledges the sen·ice rendered in facilitating its completion by .Assistant Ellicott, who transferred his foreman, 1\fr.

During the winter Assistant Bo.rd was engaged in office-work, and towards the end of April, 1888, was ini::tructed to resume the triangulation of tile St. Croix Hi ver from the limits of bis work of tlle prPcediug season. Ou Jnue l he resumed fielt.1-work, and was occupied during the month in reconnaissance, readjustment :md erection of signals, opening views, etc. Two stations were occupied for the measurement of augles, and the signals put up extended the scheme of triangulation to the foot of <Jhiputneticook Lake. Further report of tl.iis work will be made at tlie close of the next fiscal year. Topographic surrey qf tlte irest bank of the St. Croix River between Pleasant Point and Short. land.~ Station.-lnstructions hearing date of .June 8, 1888, were issued to AsEtistant C. M.

In Decemuer Lieutenant Crosby was instmcted to proceed to the Gulf of Mexico to exl'cute hy<lrographic surveys on the coast of Louisiana, reference to which will be made under the heading of Section VIII. Triangulation for the determina,tion of light-houses and other points bet1Men Grand Mauan Island and the coast of lJfaine.-The determination of the geographical position of several light-houses in the vicinity of Grand Man an Island having become desirable, and also the n·co,·erJ· of the primary station mark on that island, Assistant O. Il. Tittmann received instructions about the middle of July, 1887, to execute that work, the requisite permission having been obtainell from the Dominion Government to enter upon their teuit-0ry. Mr. Tittmann reached Grand Manan July 24, and having made a reconnaissance to lay out his work, occupied the station needed to determine the position of Seal Islaml Ligl1t-hou:se, S. W. Head Light·houi,e, Gannett Hoek Ligl1t-house, and the beacon on Ohl Proprietor Ledge. Clear weather and a calm sea being essential conditions of the work, many delays were expeneuceil in its prosecution. \Vhile occupying the Machias Seal Islands, measurements were made of the elerntion of the lights abo'\"'e an approximate high-water line, and as errors were found in the pubfo;hed lists affecting the oomputed range of visibility, a special report was made by Mr. Tittmann on the subject. The light-houses and the outlyiug·dangers to the south and southeast of Grand l\Iauan were connected properly with the triangulation on the coast of Maine. Doring the course of the work angles were observed and measurements of distances made to determine the location of Grand Manan primary station, which was supposed to baYe beeu lost or destroyed. It was finally found upon Sinclair Hill, on the southeast side of Dark Harbor, marked by a triangle ent upon the top of,tbe out-cropping rock.

Field operations were closed September 19, and the records and computations of the work forwarded soon afte.r to tlie Office. Upon returning to 'Washington in October, Mr. Tittmann was assigned to the charge of the Office of 'Veights and Measures. Jn.~pootion of topographical work upon the coast of 21foine.-Towards the end of July, 1887, Assistant Charles Hosmer lffoceeded to the coast of Maine, under instructions to inspect the topography upon that coast in the vicinity of Machias, and thence to Quodcly Head and around the coast iuto Cobscook Bay, and upon the completion of that duty to take up a topographical survey on Cobscook Bay. Part of his inquiry was directed to a comparison of th11 shore line ancl other topographical features, as delineated by recent surve;rs and by tlwse made npwarrls flf twenty-five years ago. J\lr. Hosmer had made good progress in the execution of this duty ,.and kept the field, though suffering from ill health, until early in October, when, by tile advice of his physician, he returned to his home. On the 28th of that month he died. As an officer of the Surve.Y Mr. Hosmer's record was one of faithful and honorable service during thirty ~·ears. Topographical survey of Cobscook Bay, 1liaine.-During the summer and autumn of 1887, Assistant Eugene Ellicott continued tlie topographical sun·ey of the western part of Oobscook Bay, reference to the progress of which was made in tile last Annual Report. Field operations were begun May 1 and closed November 14, the scale of survey being 1-10000. Mr. Ellicott has submitted with bis topographical sheet a descriptive report, in wbicli lie gives much detailed information respecting the character of the countr,Y over which his survey extended; its geological and topographical features, the proportions of arable and wooded land, the chief industries, etc. The Uobscook Falls present a somewhat rema.rkable physical feature. Between the northwest coast of Falls Island and the main land in the town of Pembroke is a narrow passage, the rapid rise and fall of the tides through which causes a difference of level in the inner aml outer basins immediately adjacent of about 2.6 feet at flood tide in a distance of 130 feet. The noise produced hy foe rushing waters can be heard two miles off. The statistics of Mr. Ellicott's survey are as follows: 75 Miles of shore-line snrveyed .. __ ... _____ . _.....·... - . - . - .... - - . - . . · . . . .

Between the time of resuming flel!l operations anrl tlie end of the fiscal year, Mr. Ellicott confined his efforts to the delineation of the more salient points of shore-line, and to those parts of the inland topography within easiest reach. He will make a detailed report at the en<l of the season. Continuation of the topographical 8Urt·eyof the south and north branches of Cobscook Bay, Maine.At the beginning of the fiscal year Mr. J. II. Gray, Aid in the Survey, was in the field in charge of a topographical party organized for work upon the south branch of Cobscook Bay. This work he had begun J\fa,r 21. A reference to its progress up to June 30, 1887, was made in the last Annual Report. Field-work was carried on until Uetoher 18, when the party was disbanded and operations closed for the season.

Mr. Gray has submitted a descriptive report, which has lieen filed with his t-0pographical sheet in the archives. · During the early part of the winter Mr. Gray was employed in office-work, and in January, 1888, was instructed to join the party of Assistant Jos. Hergesheimer on the west coast of Florida.

Early in June, 1888, having returned from Florida, he proceeded, under instructions, to the coast of l\Iaine, and organized his party for the survey of the north branch of Cobscook Bay. Progress was less rapid than could be desired on account of the many ledges for which low-water line had t~ be obtained. The statistics for the season will be given in the uext Annual Report. Hydrographic examinations on t7te coast of Maine for the Atlantic Coast Pilot.-At the beginning of the fiscal year the steamer Endeavor was being refitted at the New York :Kavy-:rard, the Com;t Pilot party, in charge of Lieutenant G. H. Peters, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Snr. vey, having been transferred to her from the steamer Daisy. About the middle of July the En· deavor proceeded to Portland, Maine. Data for the Coast Pilot was collected in Casco Bay ancl its tributaries till August 8, when Lieutenaut Peters proceeded eastward, making examinations during the root of the month in Penobscot Ba.y and its numerous harbors, and in Frenchman's Bay aud the waters adjae,ent. The work was then carried eastward as far as Ea'ltport. Leaving that port September 11 the Endeavor proceeded westward, devoting as muc11 time as practicable to points requiring further attention. On September 24 Lieutenant Peters left Port. and, making some examinations to the southward when the weather would permit. At New Haven, Connecticut, he receivell instructions to proceed to New York, where he arrfred with the Endeat·or October 8. · Soon after the steamer was laid up at the New York NaYy-y;ud, and the Coast l~ilot party detached to resume duty at the Office. During the season special 11;ydrographic examinations were made from time to time in conse· quence of information receive(l while carrying on the regular work of the party. In cases where these examinations developed <laugers not already shown on the charts, or depths less than had been indicated, the results were reportecl to the Hydrograpbic Inspector. Fog interfered materially with the work, and during September an unnsuan~· smoky condition of the atmosphere; but, upon the whole, the results of the srason's work were satisfactory, being such as to warrant the immediate preparation of a volume now in hantl, to cover the coast of Maine. Lieutenant Peters acknowledges the zealous service rendered in the work by Ensign W. J. Maxwell, U.S. N., and Mr. John Ross. Completion of the reoord of tidal observations at the automatic tidal station at Pulpit Coi,e, North Haven Island, Penobscot Bay, Jfaine.-For the stully of the characteristics of the tides of the Gulf of Maine a self-registering gauge was established in ,fanuaryi 1870, at Pulpit Cow, North Htwen Island, Penobscot Bay, and placed in charge of Mr. ,J. G. Spaulding. On March 28, 1888, an almost unbroken record having been kept up throughout a lunar cycle, the observations were tliscontinued, there being greater need of extended tidal series at other stations on the Atlantic coast. During the last year the observations were fully up to the standard of excellence maintained by Mr. Spaulding since the beginning of tl1e series. Ilis uniform faithfulness and efficiency in duty deserves high commendation. In April be was transferred to the cnarge of the automatic tidal station at Sandy Hook. Magnetic observation.~ at stations in Maine and Massackusetts.-Instructions issued to Assistant James :B. Baylor about the middle of July, 1887, directed him to occupy a number of magnetic stations in the New England States, at which magnetic observations had been obtained in former years, in order to secure additional data for the determination of the secular variation of the magnetic declinatio11, dip, and intensity, and also to establish some new stations iu those States, and one in Washington, D. C. Having executed the duty last mentioned, reference to which more in detail will be found under the heading of Section III, Mr. :Baylor proceeded to the State of Maine, and began his magnetic work there by the occupation of a new station at Damariscotta, Lincoln County, establishing it in an open lot in front of the Methodist church. Time, latitude, and azimuth were determined by observations on the sun August 4, 5, and 7, and the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity on August 5, 8, and 9. A new station was next established at Mill bridge, Washington County, Maine, on the hill north of the Ohristian church. Time, latitude, azimuth, a.nd the magnetic elements were determined here by observations made August 13.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

At Machiasport, Maine, a new station was established in the Government reservation at Fort O'Brien. Time, latitude, and azimuth were determined August 19, and the magnetic elements August 20. The station of 1879, in the center of the parade-ground at Fort Sullivan, Eastport, was re-occupied for the determillation of the magnetic elements on August 24 and 26. Time and azimuth were determined Augu:st 23 and 26. At Pre:sque I:sJe, Aroostook County, Maine, a new station was established in the open park in front of the Phair Hotel, on Main street, Time, azimuth, and the magnetic elements were determined August 30 and 31. At llonltou, Aroostook County, a new station was established over one of the granite piers at Hancock barracks, just east of the town. Time, latitude, aziu.mth, and the magnetic elements were determined by obHervations made September 5, 6, and 7. At, Vanceboro, 'V ashington County, a new station was established in the open lot north of the Roman Catholic church. Time, latitude, azimuth, and the magnetic elements were determined by obsernttiou8 made September 10, 12, aud 13. At Danforth, Washington County, a i1ew station was established on the hill in front of District School No. 5, and observations rna,le for time, latitude, azimuth, and the magnetic elements on September 15 mul 16. At ).fattawamkeag, Penobscot County, a new station was established in an open lot on Main street, south of the postmaster'8 house. Time, latitude, and azimuth were determined on September 17 aml 18, and the magnetic elements September 19. A new station was next e8tabliRhcd at Greenville, Piscataquis County, its location being in au open lot north of the L<tke Ilomie and to the east of the south cove of Moosehead Lake. Time, latitude, azimuth, and the magnetic clements were determined here on September 24. At the Maine Central Institute, Pittsfield, Somerset County, a new station was established in the grounds of the Institute, southwest of the main building, and observations made for time, latitude, and the magnetic elements, September 29 and 30. A new station was established at Farmington, Franklin County, in the fiats of Sand River, and just north of Prescott's factor.r, on Depot street. On October 6 and 7 observations were made for time, latitude, and azimuth, and the magnetic elements. It had been intended to re-occupy one of the old stations on Bramhall Hill, Portland, Maine, but it was found that a house had been built over the site of the station of 1864 and 1865, and that the proximity of electric wires had made the stations of 1859 and 1863 unavailable. It be._ came necessary, therefore, to occupy a new station, and this was established in the grounds of Mrs .·J. B. Brown, as near the former station as practicable. Observations for time, azimuth, and the magnetic elements were made here on October 13, 14, and l 5. At Plum Island, near Newburyport, Massachni;etts, a station was established as near the station of 1859 as the changed surroundings would permit. Time, azimuth, and the magnetic elements were determined October 18, 19, and 20. At Fort Lee, near Salem, Massachusetts, the station of 1855, in the center of the old fort, was re-occupied. Time, azimuth, and the magnetic elements were determined October 22 and 23. The funds a'·ailable for the work having become exhausted after the occupation of t,he last named station, Mr. Ba;ylor was instructed to snspeml field operatioils for tlie sea.son, an cl take up the computation of his observations. His records aud resuits are now in the Office. In December he was temporarily assigned to duty in connection with gravity work, reference to which is made.. under a beading in Sectio.n III. Determitiation of boundary lines of towns in the State of Massachusetts.-In connection with the topographical survey of the State of Massachusetts, of' which Assistant Henry L. Whiting is, by special assignment, one of the Commissioners, the work of determining the boundary lines of t,ownships in the State was prosecuted during the season of 1887 under Mr. Whiting's general direction by Assistants Gershom Braclford and C.H. Van Orden. Reference to this work, and to the instructions under which it was again ta.ken up, in April, 1887, was made in the last Annual Report. Messrs. Bradford and Van Orden have each made special reports of their surveys, abstracts of which are as follows:

Beginning in Wareham Township, at the head of Buzzard's Bay, in Plymouth County, Mr. Bradford carried his work to the westward, and at the close of field operations, November 29, bad established in geographical position the boundary lines of W areharn, Marion, Mattapoisett, aud Rochester, in Plymouth County, an<l of Fair Haven, Acushnet, New Bedford, Dartmouth, Westport, Fall River, and Somerset, in Bristol County, besides. incidentally determining parts of the boundary lines of the townships of Middleborough, Freetown, Dighton, and Swansey, bordering upon the above. It was agreed by Messrs. Bradford and Van Orden to adopt a uniform method of numbering the town corners by beginning at a southwestern corner and numbering consecutively from that round by west, prefixing the name of the township, as Acushnet 1, and so on. The heights of many of the stations were determined with a vertical circle, and were referred to the ground and to high-water bench-marks upon· rocks at Cromeset Neck, in Wareham and Clark's Cove, New Bedford. Elevations in Fall River, derived by the City Engineer from levels to the"Coast and Geodetic Survey bench-mark there, were also made available. · For the triangulation, bases were generally obtained by lines joining points of the Coast aml Geodetic Survey and the Borden State Survey, the latter having been previously adjusted in the office to conform to standard geodetic data. The principal base stations were Monk's Hill, Alden, Great Hill, Mendal, New Bedford Court-house, and Copecut. Mr. Bradford observes that to determine in position marks placed with no reference to the question of intervisibility, and often in wooded swamps, difficult of access, presented difficulties of a peculiar nature. These were overcome, after a number of devices had been tried, by the use of flagged poles in trees adjacent to the boundary marks. The poles were secured steadily in position by guys, and elevations of one hundred feet above the ground were thus attainable, enough to overtop the wooded hills. To these poles the bouudary marks were referred by a compass course and a distance measured from a point plumbed under the part of the pole observed upon to the mark. These compass courses were run by an engineer's transit, with which direct and reverse bearings were ta.ken between the pole and tl1e mark, measurements of distance being made with a steel tape. Observations were, of course, made directly upon the boundary marks or upon signals plum bed over them whenever practicable.

Mr. Van Orden having reported to Mr. Whiting April 26, was directed to take up the deter· mination of township boundary lines on the peninsula. of Cape Cod. Beginning at the northern end of that peninsula, his iirst work was to fiml the six stone monuments between the towns of Provincetown and Truro. The base lines Cape Cod Light-house to Wood End Light-house, and Cape Cod Light-house to Long Point being available, and the country an open one, but little dif. ficulty was experienced in connecting thP,se monuments with the triangulation. The importance of making this connection is shown by the constant danger to which the fifth and sixth stones were exposed, of being covered up by the shifting sands or washed out by the encroachments of the sea; and as a means of deciding upon changes in shore-Jine due to such encroachments the secoring of boundary stones on the peninsula or the practicability of reproducing their positions in the event of loss is very desirable. On the harbor side, the positions of boundary st.ones become

26

of much importance to the fishing interests of townships. During the preceding season the location of the bay-shore monument between Wellfleet and Eastham bad become the subject of a dispute which was eventually brought before the State iegislature. From Provincetown to Chatham the work progressed rapidly, but from Chatham to the Plymouth line the boundary stones were generally in dense woods or hollows, and the country being, as a rule, heavily wooded, with no prominent hills, l\fr. Van Orden met with difficulties similar to those already adverted to. But by availing himself of similar expedients in regard to signals, and by laying out schemes of small triangles to reach the boundary stonPs, basing these triangulations on points well determined by the Government and State Surveys, he was enabled to complete all of bis determinations satisfactorily. While at Barnstable, in compliance with a request from the Chairman of the County Commissioners, and with the approval of Mr. Whiting, l\fr. Van Orden examined the county meridian line, connecting it with the triangulation and determining its azimutll. In connection with the town boundary survey, it was det>med advisable by the State Commission to determine a series of accurate level bench-marks throughout the State, and this work was begun by Mr. Van Ord en by running a double line of levels from Orleans station to Sagamore station 011 the Old Colony Railroad, and a single line from there to the bench-mark of the Cape Cod tidegauge. A double line was also run from Harwich station to Harwich Exchange in Harwich Center, and a single check-line from Barnstable station to assumed high water. Brewster station was connected with the main line by a double line of levels. The whole line, so far run, is permanently marked by copper plates secured to the station and freight houses of the Old Colony Railroad. Field operations were closed December 2.

Physical hydography, coast of Cape Cod Peninsula.-Upon the completion of the physical surveys in New York Harbor early in August, 1887, Assistant H. L. Marindin was instructed to re-organize his party as a shore party, with a camp at the entrance of Nauset Harbor, Oape Cod, and take up a survey, the object of which was defined in a memorandum furnished by Assistant Henry Mitchell. The principal points of this memorandum were as follows: 1. Tidal observations and levelings for the determination of stages and slopes on the sill of Vineyard Sound, and for planes of reference of both topography and bydrography. 2. To extend the shore-line and crest-line surveys along the outside shore of Cape Cod to the limits of the shoal building supply, the work to include slopes of bluffs, sections of barrier sands, and submerged contours out to four fathoms of water. The work as thus laid out was closely prosecuted throughout the season. On the 30th of August the field-work proper began by the location of a longitudinal section of levelings along the coast from the inlet into Nanset Harbor to Nauset Three Lights. This longitudinal section was designed to form the back-bone of the cross-sections running out to seaward through the line of breakers and normal to the shore. It was extended dnring the season by lines of prooise leveling along Nauset Beach to the bench-mark near the tide-gauge at Harding's Beach. The cross-sections were located and measured at an average distance apart of three hundred. meters (984.3 feet). Each cross section was leveled and joined to the longitudinal section, which wa-s connected by precise leveling with the tidal bench-marks established daring the season. The levels at each cross-section were carried out into the water at the time of low water or near it, a.nd the soundings taken on these sections were obtained as near the high-water sta.ge as the circumstances would permit, with the objoot of overlapping the points reached by the level from shore. By sounding at or near the time of high water, and backing the whale-boat almost on the breaker·

the first sounding was obtained very near to, if not overlapping, those points where the strand was laid bare by the relreat of the tide. It was proposed to show from the observations the position of the low-water line with the ocean at rest; also the position of a mean-level line, and that of high water with the ocean at rest. The high-water line as obtained by the plane-table is not the same as that noted above, hut rather a line defining the reach of the seas at the next preceding higl1 water. The location aIHl heights at the foot of the uluffs were also to be given, these being the lines of greatst erosion reached by the sea only during severe gales. Permanent beueh-marks were establishe(l at the inlet into Nauset Harbor, on Pochet Island, "on Chatham North Light, on Harding's Beach Light-house, on a fish-packing stand near the tidegauge on Ilartling's Beach, and on a house belouging to Seth Mallows at t!ie Powder Hole, Monomoy Point. These benches, with tlrn exception of the one last named, were com1ected by two lines of precise levels, run in opposite directions and aggregating a length of twenty-eight miles. Numerous temporary benches were established in connection with the permanent ones. The tide-gauges at Nauset Harbor, at Chatham Beach (outside), at Harding's Beach~ and at Powder Hole were observed simultaneously night and day for eight days, and during the same period the turning of the tidal current was observed at the Handkerchief, Pollock Rip, and Shovelful Light.ships. The line of precise levels joining the ti<le-gaugcs at Harding's Beach with those at Chatham and Nauset Ilarbor was completed early in November, an<l on the 7th of that month the party was disbanded. Mr. Marindin acknowledges the efficient aid rendered in the work by Messrs E. E. Haskell and Bomer P. Ritter, experts in physical hydrography. His elaborate report, of which the foregoing is only an abstract, is accompanied by a sketch showing the locality of the survey and the positions of the tide gauges and bench-marks. He will ultimately submit a descriptive report to accompany the two sheets of physical hydrography on which the results of the survey are shown. Reference will be made under a heading in Section II to Mr. l\larindiu's work in New York Harbor, which immediately preceded that on Cape Cod.

He remained Ln this duty, wit.h an interval of absence on leave, until early in February, 1888, when he reported for duty at the Office. Messrs. Haskell and Ritter had reported at the Office in November. During the period from February 10 till early in Juue Mr. l\farindin was occupied with the compu.tations and drawings require(l to show the results of physical l1ydrograpbic surveys in New York Bay and Harbor and on Monomoy Shoals and the bea.ches adjacent. His elaborate report on the tidal levels and flow of currents in New York Bay and Harbor, with drawings accompanying, was submitted May 15, and will be published as Appendix No. 9 to this volume. · In June, this office-work having been completed, instructions for field-work received during the preceding months took eff!}Ct, and proceeding to Oa.pe Cod, with Messrs.

reason of changes in the configuration of shore-line during periods rangiug from thirty to forty years, the parties organized for tllat \\Ork duriug the summer and autumn of 1887 were placed under the geunal supervision of Assistant Henry L. Whiting, b~- iustructions issued towards the beginning of the fiscal year. Assistaut W. I. Vinal, Su bassistant R. A. Marr, and Aid E. L. Taney· were directed to report to Mr. Whiting by instructions issued towards the end of June. To Mr. Vinal be assigned the resurveys of shore-line and localities adjacent on Martha's Vineyard, to lUr. Marr the triangulation of Nantucket and Vineyard Sounds, and to Mr. Taney the topograph· ical resur'\'eys on the islanll of Nantucket. From a general re\·iew of the results presentell by the work, Mr. Whiting has submitted a report based upon comparisons of these and former surveys. Mr. Taney'i.-1 work, which, in addition to the resurvey of the Nantucket shore-line, included that of the small islands of Tuckernuck and l\Iuskeget, and the still smaller beaeh islands and shoals surrounding them, callecl for but little interior topography, the features of the shore being simpler in character than on Martha'l:l Vine_yard, with fewer artificial details 1mbject to change. Almost the only exception was at Siasconset, where some cottages and larger buildings bave been added to the quaint settlement as it was forty years ago. The changes in the position of the im· mediate shore, particularly aloug the sonth side and at the west end of the island, have, however, been much greater in general results than on Martha's Vineyard. Great Point, the southeasterly headland of Nantucket Sound, that most important highway for coastwise vessels, has, as Mr. Whiting obscn·csi undergone important changes~ accorcling to . history and trustwo1 thy testimony, aflecting in former years the navigable limits of the water way between it and Mouomoy Point. But now it is to be noted that the extremity of Great Point is in almost the exact geographical position that it was forty-one years ago. The shapi'l of the point is now somewhat less sharp. About one-eighth of a mile south of the extreme point on the funer side, the shore-hues of 1846 and 1887 coincide exactly. After giving further detail11 of changes in tile shore-line, Mr. Whiting states that in genera.I terms the changes of Great Point indicated by the two sur\'cys have resulted in the narrowing of the southerly part with a broadening of the last three-fourths of a mile at the extreme end. Along the eastern side of the island, and from Sankaty Head south and west there has been al· ternately waste aml gain, one of the most marked instances of the latter being in the form of a long outward sweep or wa.ve in the shore.line, extending for about two and a half miles, having a width at Sankaty Head of about one hundred feet; about one mile southwest of the Light-house four hundred fet't; off Siasconet Village two hundred and fifty feet, a.ud l eyond this again a. width of about three hundred and fifty feet. Beyond the present point where the lines of waste a.ml accretion cross each other, aud for about three-fourths of a mile southwest a.ud westerly to

about opposite Tom Nevers Pond, a former outward bend in the shore bas been wat>hed away, the greatest waste in width being abouL six lmmlred feet. Attributing these sweeps or waws to resultant effects of sea.dash aJ)(l littoral currents, ::\1r. Whiting remarks that the same character of forma~ion anrl moYement is observable along the outer shore of ()ape Cod, particularly between Highland Light aud Race Point. With regard to .Muskeget Island and the beaches south of it, and Tuckernuck Island, Mr. Whiting refers to notable clrnnges indicated by the last resurvey, tlie cliaractcr of which indicate.s a general recedin1' to the northward and castwartl of the ocean boundary, and the driving back of the higb·watcr line by the forces which ti.How the sands up above high water. Details of these changes are given in bis report, which is accompanied by a tracing from the surveys of 1846, 1856, aud 1887. Along the east shore of :Martha's Vine_yard the cl1anges which have taken place within the scope of Mr. VinaPs survey in the inten·al of forty-one years since the first survey was made, are not of special physical importance, and do not affect matters of navigation. The waste of the bluff at the East Chop of Vineyard Haven Harbor has not been as much since 1871-the ratio not so great as it was between 1846 and 1871. 'This is probably owing t-0 the influence of the recent struct· ures along this part of the shore, whereby the littoral movement of the sands has been arrest-0d. The same may be said of the ratio of change at West Chop. The first survey of this point by the Coast Survey was made by :Mr. Whiting in 1845; the next one, in 1871, was made by Lim also. A comparison of ihe results of these surrnys with that of 1887 shows that some changes have taken place in the outline and material of the Chop, and of the sound and harbor shores on either side of it. After giving details of his comparisons .Mr. Whiting states tlmt there is no evidence of extensive recent waste at West Chop by either wave or current action, and that it is au important fact that at this most salient point on Martha's Vineyard, making the greatest contraction in the width of tho sound between the shores of the island and the main land at Nobska Point, but little, if any, change has occurred in the geographical position of the high-water line since the date of the survey of 1845. At the point of Cape Poge the waste of beach aad bluff has been greater than at any other place in this part of the island, being about three hundred and twenty-five feet. Along the shore of Chappaquiddick Island, from the entrance to Cape Poge Pond to the long point of the island opposite Edgartown Village, there bas been no marked change. A resurvey of the New South Inlet iuto Ootamy Bay, including a short reach of the shores on either side of it, showed that a remarkable change had taken place in the llosition of this inlet between the dates of the sun·eys of 1886and1887, a period of fifteen months. During this time the position of the inlet has moved a distance about equal to its width, namely, about twelve hundred feet, the point of beach forming the westerly chop of the inlet being now about where the easterly chop was last year. ·The easterly PQint bas moved still farther eastward, so that the inlet is now about five hundred feet wider than it was in 1886, being on October 26, 188'1, iabout sixteen hundred and forty feet in width. The general position of the beach wei;t of the inlet does not seem to have undergone much change, but east of it the mass of the beach has been beaten inward to the north for about a mile, as far as the resurvey extended. The greatest movement was at the point which was found to be about three hundred and twen_y-five feet farther inward than its position in 1886. These changes gave an additional basis for Mr. Whiting's prediction, referred to in the last annual report, that the iiilet would eventually work eastward. The rapidity of this movement bas, however, been greater than was anticipated. At t.he same rate of progress the westerly point of the inlet will reach the line of the fast land of Chappaquiddick in about six years, where it will again be in the same eomlition and subject to the same forces that caused it to close in 1869. It was thirteen years in making an equal previous movement. Mr. Whiting's report on the shore-line changes on Martha's Vine3'·ard (Appendix No. 9 1 1886) is accompanied by a map showing changes in Ootamy Bea.eh from surveys made in 1846, 1856, 1871, and 18861 with special reft>rence to the opening and closing -0f former inlets. Other dnty assigned to Mr. Whiting, in connection with the Massachusetts State Survey, is refeITed to under a separate heading in this section. Pi addition t.o the duties here referred to, a.nd those relating to the resurveys of town boundaries

in the State of Massachusetts, Mr. Whiting was occupied, under instructions issued early in November, 1887, in continuing and completing the marking of the points of triangulation determined by Mr. Marr on Nantucket and Martha's Vineyarrl. .After the close of the work of the several field parties, he was authorized to retain and ink the topographical sheets of Mr. Taney's survey of Kautucket. This duty occupied him during the most of the winter and spring, though occasionally interrupted by nesessary service for Massachusetts as Secretary of the Board of the State Commissioners. Ile hacl also office occupation in preparing some samples for topographic representation of the rocky shores of tlie coast of Maine . .As preliminary to future field operations, be ~mbmitted on :March 8, 1888, a scheme for continuing the topographical resurveys of Vineyard Sound and vicinity. His first active duty in connection with field operations was in conference with Mr. Van Urden, relative to his proposed continuation of the town boundary work of 1887. Mr. Van Orden took the field May 27, in Barnstable and Plymouth Counties, Massachusetts, to complete aud close up the triangulation of 1887 in the former county, and to connect with the work of 1885 in the latter. This work was in successful progress at the close of the fiscal year. _ In pursuance of instructions, Assistant Vinal reported for duty auout the middle of June, and was assigned to the resun·ey of Woodis Holl, harbors and passage way, with the connecting topograpby in Falmouth and on Naushon Island on a scale of 1-5000. Reference to Mr. Vinal's report of this work is made under a later Jieading in this section. Triangulation of Nantucket and Vineyard Sounds.-The triangulation incident to the resurveys on Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, and the adjacent islands, was assigned to Sub-assistant R · .A. Marr, uy instructions issued June 20, 1887, and was executed in accordance with the views and suggestions of .Assistant H. L. Whiting. U1)on Nantucket and its outlying islands, Tuckernuck and l\foskeget, the triangulation was carried forward from two of the old stations, Shawaukerno and Gilllns' Pond, that had been recovered by Mr. Taney; it was connected also with the fixed points, Great Point J,ight, Sankaty Head Light, South Church Spire, and Tuckernuck Telegraph. The iuterior points, vVeeweeder Life Saving Station and J\leridiau, were determined in order to have ready reference stations for future use in case of marked changes in the island. Meridian statiou is the south post of three whicb mark the prime meridian of the island of Nantucket; these are han<lHome licxagonal granite posts, with bronze caps, bearing the cardinal points, and were put. up under contract for the State. Their connection with the triangulation developed an error in the positiou of the north post, its bearing being 28' 05" east of north from the south post. On .l\Iartha's Vineyard the old stations of Indian and Prospect Chilmark were intact, and this line was usell as a base. The hydrographic signals wl1ich had been established on both shores of the sound were determined in position as well as other points necessary for the topographical surveys. By means of a striding level attached to the telescope it was found that Peaked Hill was about four feet higher than Prospect Chilmark, which has hitherto been supposed to be the highest elevation on Martha's Vineyard. Under Mr. Whiting's direction the stations on Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and No Man's Land were marked with solid grauitc 1wsts, or with drill holes in surface bowlders. The instruments and stand were mounted at each station according to a plan devised by Mr. Marr and referred to in tbe report of his work at Cape Charles, Virginia, under heading Section III.

Topographical resurvey of the shore-lines of Nantucket, Muskeget, T1wkernuck, and the small islands in their vicinity.-Reforeuce bas been made under a 11revious heading in this section to the assignment of Subassistant E. L. Taney to the charge of topogra,phical resurve~ys on Nantucket and the small islamls in its vicinity under the general supervision of Assistant H. L. Whiting, and an account of Mr. Taney's work has been given as derived from the full report of Mr. Whiting. Points were determined for the plane-table survey from the old triangulation stations, Gibbs' Pond and Shawaukemo, which Mr. Taney succeeded iu 1·ecuvering. From these aud Great Point Light and Brant Light, he made a plane-table triangulation of the part of the island east of the town of Nantucket. For that part of the island west of the town and for the islands near by, points were furnished by Subassistant Marr. Field operations were closed November 28. The statistics are :

Whiting soon after the beginning of the fiscal year, Assistant ·w. Irving Vinal was assigned to the immediate charge of' the topographical resurvey of part of the shore-line and details adjacent of' Martha's Vineyard Island. The resurvey was mainly directed to those portions of' the island where marked changes have taken place during recent years. It included tlrn eastern and western shores of Cotamy Bay and Edgartown Harbor, and extended thence westward and northward along the coast, taking in Cottage Oity and Vineyard Haven, and terminating at the entrance into Chappaquansett or Tashmoo Pond . .At Cotamy Bay a junction was made with Assistant "\:Vhiting's resurvey of 1886. Edgartown is the oldest settlement, on the island, dating back to 1642. Vineyard Haven is the most noted roadstead for coasting vessels on the Atlantic coast, and affords perfect protection except in north· eiist gales. Cottage City occupies the whole of East Chop. It has grown up within recent years, and now includes the settlements or summer resorts of Oak Bluffs, Camp Grounds, Vineyard Highlands, Eastville, and Lagoon Heights. Mr. Vinal gives in his descriptive report, which he has sent to the archives, many details of interest with regard to t.he geological formations on the island, its topographical features, means of transportation, etc. Ile closed field operations November 10, 1887. The statistics of his survey are: Miles of shore-line surveyed ·..···.·.·..··......··.......·. - . . . . . . . . . . . . 42 Miles of roads, streets, aml ra.ilroads surveyed............................ 95 Miles surveyed of creeks, ponds, and ditches ....... - . . . . . . . . . . . . . ... . . . . . . 12 Area (approximate) of survey, in square miles............................. 10 During the winter Mr. Vinal was engaged in office-work, completing his field sheets and reports. After reporting in person for duty at the office he was assigned to i;ervioe in the Drawing Division, and during part of the time was occupied in arranging and cataloguing the mh;cellaneous papers of that Division. -Upon being relieved from office duty he was instructed to report by lt»tter to Assistant Whiting for duty under his direction on the coast of Massachusetts, and on the 18th of June he organized his party at Wood's Holl, Massachusett.s, and took up a. shore-line resurvey of Martha's Vineyard Sound in that vicinity and to the northward. For this resurvey the topograph· ical features are to be l}.hown in minnte detail, the scale being 1-5000. Further mention of its progress will be made in the next Annual Report.

Blake, left Boston July 7, and proceeded under instructions to run lines of off-Rhore soundings about firn rnile8 apart between the localities named. During the first part of the season fogs prevailed almost continuously, so that not nnfrequently lines of sounding started with the most favorable weather would have to be aliandoned in a few hours. The work was puslled at e.-ery opportunity, however, and on .August 21 was comJ1Wted.

Hydrog1·aphic resurveys in Vineyard Sound and in the channels and harbors adjacent.-Under instrnctions issued about the middle of J nne, 1887, Lieut. C. P. Perkins, U. S. N., .Assistaut Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the schooner Eagre, took up the resurvey of Vineyard Sound and adjacent waters soon after the beginning of the fisc<tl year. His work was laid out ou four prQjections: one of Vineyard Sound on a scale of 1-20000, one to the east of the island of Martha's Vineyard on a scale of 1-10000, one of R-Obinson's Holl on 1-10000, and one of \Vood's Holl on 1-5000· .A rlescriptive report l1as been submitted by Lieutenant Perkins for file in the archives with bis llydrographic sheets. In this report are gh-en many details in regard to tile channels and harbors included in the area under surrn_y. He obserrns that the channel through the sound carries no less than eight fathoms, and that through Quick's Holl six fathoms. Robinson's Holl is impracticable, and \Vood's Holl dangerous, except for small craft. Ile found the tides in the sound very complex and much influenced by the wind. A determination of the zeros of the several tidegauges wai; made, and all were referred to the lowest plane, that at Menemsha Bight. .All known shoals and dangers were carefully developed; among these, Squash Meadow Shoals, Oltl Man Rock, Devil's Bridge, and Sow and Pig's Reef. Information having been received at the Office through the Light-House Board of the existence of an uncharted ledge off the West Chop Light-house, an examination of the locality by Lieutenant Perkins led to the development of two dangers to navigation to the north and northeast of that Light-house; a rocky shoal-pateh having over it a least depth of scrnn feet, and a emall rocky shoal with a least depth over it of sixteen and one·half feet. \Yarning of the dangers was immediately given by the publication of Notice to Mariuers No. 93. Lim1tenant Perkins had the aid of Ensigns II. W. Harrison, N. J. L. T. Ilalpine, Baine C. / Dent, aud Franklin Swift, U. S. N.

In Jauuar_y, 1888, he was directed to make an examination of certain lumps that had formed 11t tlrn inner end of Gedney's Channel, having less depth of water ornr them than were found in the surVl'Y of 1885. The results of this examination were published in Notice to Mariners No. 99. On February 28, 1888, Lientenaut Perkins was detached from duty on the Survey.

Arriving on the field of work July 4, active operations were begun the next day. The scheme of work was laid out on a scale of 1-10000 for the inshore and 1-40000 for the off-shore hydrography, and included in its limits the waters between Block Island and Point Judith, thence along the coast of Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Gooseberry Neck; thence to Cutty hunk, Gay Head, and No Man's Land, and seaward as far as a line from Block Island Southeast Light to Davis's New South Shoal Light-ship, and as much beyond this line as would include the twenty. fathom curve. In executing the hydrography the ten-fathom curve was developed by !Iormal lines, seven to the mile, arul crosseu by lines, five to the mile, except in the vicinity of Westport, where the ten fathom curve is at such a distance olf shore that tills system was only carried to the eight-fathom curve. The off-shore work, on a scale of 1-40000, was lapped over the 1-10000 work, and consisted of a series of lines north and south, one-half a mile apart, for a distance of about six miles from shore, anu thence seaward one mile apart. This Sj'Stem was crossed by lines east and west, beginning near the shore, one-half mile apart, and after continuing tlii::; system for about six miles the distance was increased gradually until the outer seaward lines were oae and one-half miles apart. This was the general system of execution; such deviations were made at different points as the nature of the work required. Where the ten-fathom curve impinged upon the shore the in shore system was carried beyond to a distance of about three-fourths of a mile.· As the work was a resurvey, the shoals and ledges already charted were carefully redeveloped, and great attention was paid to the soundings to note any irregularities of bottom, which, when found, were re-examined. The soundings being all on an exposed rocky coast, many difficulties were encountered and no little anxiety felt at times in running the boat-lines on account of the continual swell breaking over the rocks and ledges, the prevailing winds during summer blowing on shore and setting in a heavy sea. Fogs retarded the work. During the month of September, when the sea was unmmally quiet, no work could be done for a long period on account of a dense smoky atmosphere which enveloped the whole coast, rendering objects invisible at a short distance. J,ieutenant Moser states that on several ledges now charted less water was found than previously recorded, and a number of uncharted rocks and ledges were developed. In regard to these his reports give full details. No opportunity was lost of consulting local authorities-pilots and especially fishermenwhose knowledge of rocks is apt to be exceedingly minute. He recommends a buoy to mark the Narrow River Ledge as a guide to vessels running from New.Port to Narragansett Pier and to vessels beating up to the western passage of Narragansett Bay. Also one to mark the seaward end of the Cuttywaugh Ledge south of Quicksand Hill. This buoy would serve not only as a warning to vessels beating up to this ledge, but as a general guide to keep vessels from approaching this dangerous shore. He suggests also for consideration, the placing of a buoy to mark the four-fathom ledge to the eastward of the Hen and Chickens Lightship. This buoy would be useful to vessels during heavy weather. .An error in the position of Vineyard Sound Light-vessel, as shown on the charts, having been found, its correct position was determined by Lieutenant Moser, and announcement ma1le in Notice to Mariners No. 95. He has transmitted to the Office, for file with his hydrographic sheets, two descriptive reports, covering all the topics suggested for consideration in the instructions and memoranda for suclt reports. (Appendix No. 11, 1887.) The following officers were attached to the party: Lieut. E. E. Wright, U. S. N.; Ensigns H. A. Field, W. 0. Hulme, H. P. Jones, and II. E. Parmenter, U. S. N. For the sea.son, which closed early in November, the statistics are:

Hydrograpliic resuri·eys in Vineyard and Nantucket SJunds.-Under instructions dated April 27, 1888, Lieut. S. C. Paine, U. S. N., .Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, proceeded to the Navy. yard, New York, took command of tlie schooner Eagre, and put lier iu couditiun fur active service. Toward the end of l\:Iay he arrived with the Eagre at ·wood's Holl, l\Iassachusetts, and began the hydrographic surreys in Vineyard and Nantucket Sounds, iodimtted as his work for the season in detailed instructions from the Hydrographic Inspector. These surveys were in progress at tbe close of the fiscal ;year, and further mention of them will be made in the next annual report. Rydrographic e.mniinationsfor the Coast Pilot on the soiithcrn coast of Massachusetts, including Nantucket and Vineyard Bounds and Bnzzard's Bay.-ln order to test sailing lines and decide a uumller of questions which had arisen in connection with the preparation of the Atlantic Coast Pilot, Lieut. G. H. Peters, U. S. N., Assistant, was instructed towards the end of l\:Iay, 1888, to take command of the steamer Daisy and make hydrographic examinations of the harbors iu Vineyard and Nantucket Sounds and neighlloriug waters. Lieutenant Peters observes that these sounds form a great highway of commerce, being said to rank in this respect next after the English Channel and the Straits of Gibraltar. The adjacent harbors and anchorages have thus an importance resulting from their location far beyond that arii;;ing from the local carrying trade. In planning and carrying out the work this fact was given due cousiueration. With regard to Buzzard's Bay he remarks that it is mainly important, commercially, as an approach to New Bedford and to Wareham, but the minor harbors along the shores of the bay received all the attention necessary. )[any changes having occurretl since the survey of 1845, a resurvey of the bay is exceedingly desirallle. Advantage was taken of a favorable opportunity to extend the examinations into Narragansett Bay. Due effort was made throughout the work to make available the local knowledge of persons familiar with the waters examined, and to verify data previously obtained by means of the geueral forms of Coast Pilot interrogatories. }fr. ,Johu Ross, of the Coast Pilot office party, served daring the season and rendered valuable assistance. On ,July 7, in accordance with instructions, the Dais.11 Wal'! turned over to Ensign Franklin Swift, U. S. N., and, field operations having been closed, the party of Lieutenant Peters returned to the Office to resume their regular duties.

Hydrograpltic examinations in Stonington Harbor, Oonnecticut.-A. letter having been received from the general manager of the Stonington line of steamers, referring to a suppos1>,d shoaling in the ap1lroaches to Stonington Harbor, Lieut. Sumner C. Paine, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and
Geodetic Snrve;y, commanding the schooner Eagre, was instructed to make an examination of the locality with special reference to the shoals known as Noyes Rocks and the l\:Iiddle Ground. This duty was accomplished between l\:Iay 22 and 29, after which Lieutenant Paine proceeded to Wood's Holl, Massachusetts, and took up the regular work of the season. Examination of coast currents in the approaches to New rork Harbor.-In connection with the ofl'.sllore soumlings bet.ween Phelps Bank and l\Iontank Point, referred to under a previous headiug in this section, Lieut. J. E. Pillsbury, U. S. N., Assistant Uoast and Geodetic Survey, comman11ing the steamer Blake, took up, under instructions, an examination of the currents in the ,·icinity of the entrances to Vineyard, Block faland, and Long Island Sounds, and also between Fire lslaml and Barnegat. Befoie beginning to observe, he deemed it expedient t-0 gather as much testimony as possible respecting these currents from the masters of ocean steamers bound to New York and from pilots and :fishermen, etc., so as to get a knowledge of the usual routeR of vessels regularly approaching the port. This decision was based upon the experience he had gained in his recent deep-sea

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODE'rIC SURVEY. sounding work from Mon tank to beyond N antuckct Shoals, where he had found a considerable current setting on and off shore, and surmised that perhaps the currents at this point of the route might be of more influence in deflecting .-essels from their courses than those to the westward. The testif!lony of the ocean steamship captains was, generally, that the allowances they made for currents depended upon the winds. With a wind on shore they allowed a trifle off shore on their courses. Two or three captains made allowances for tide, a trifle off shore for tl1e flood and on shore for the ebb. Fishermen, as a rule, had not remarked a current, bn~ of course made an allowance for leeway. Upon this testimony, with his own experience, LieL1tena11t Pillsbury decide.d to multiply current stations in the vicinity of the openings to VineJ-ard Sound, Block Island, and Long Island Sounds, and then obscn-e the currents between Fire Island and Barnegat. He found that the currents at tbe nine stations first occupied in the vicinity of No Man's IJand, Block Island, and Moutauk Point were much stronger than thmm between Fire Island and Bar~egat. This lie thinks would naturally be caused by the larger basins to be filled aud emptied in the sounds and bays of southeru Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. On all the stations there was a marked interference with the direction and velocity of the current, the cause of a part of which seems to lie a variation in the strength of the tidal flow, which is stronger at spring tides than at neaps, and stronger after the highest declination of the moon than it is after zero declinatiou. But until much more extended series of observations can be made, and under conditions more varied, the laws governing the action of these currents can not be fully developed. Iiieutenaut Pillsbury's conclusions for the practical purposes of navigation were embodied in a Notice to Mariners (No. 97). They are substautially as follows: That off the entrances to Vineyard, Block Island, and I1ong Island Sounds there is a tidal cur. rent which sets on shore with tbeflootl and off shore witll the ebb, its direction changing from one to four hours after high and low waters at Newport, Rhode Island. The velocity is greater at spring-tides than at neaps, varyillg from two-tenths of a knot to one and a half knots. The direction and velocity of the tidal currents is interfered with by what is probably an inshore current setting to the westward, the inftucnce of which is felt the least the nearer to the shore. On the track of the European steamers bound to New York, the tidal current is most decided in direction on and off shore at the time of spring-tides. Three days after tbe highest declination of the moon the counter-current is strongest, setting to the southward alHl westw~rd. The greatest current found on this track has been about one knot per hour. In allowing for this current, the state of the tides and the position of the moon should be taken into account. Between Fire Island and Barnegat only a. feeble current was fouud, generally but two or three tenths of a knot, and at tbe time of spring-tides increasing to about one-lialf knot. Lieutenant Pillsbury, in the closing part of his report, discusses the question as to the direct effect of wind on the tide-water in forming a current, and adduces evidence tending to show that short winds do not produce marked currents in deep water. On the questiou of the effect of loug continued winds, like the trades, he reserves his opinion till he has obtained further data bearing upon the subject. Bia explorations of the Gulf Stream currents, which were continued during the following winter and spring, are the subject of an abstract under the heading of Section VI. Triangulation on the south eoal!t of Long Island and determination of the qeographical position of Light-lwuses on the coasts of Connecticut and Rhode lsland.-Tbe triangulation required for the shore-line resurvey of the bays on tbe south coast of Long Island ha,·ing been' assigned to Assistant A. T. Mosman, aR also the determination in geographical position of some light-houses ou the coasts of Rhode Island and Connecticut, by instructions dated April 30, 1888, Mr. l\Josman organ. ized his party early in May at Centre Moriches, Long Island, and began a search for two of the old stations from which aa a base to make a triangulation ofMoriches Bay. Upon the completion of this portion of the survey towards the end of June, the party was transfeITed to Shinnecock Bay. The interval between their arrival and the end of the fiscal year was spent in erecting signals and marking statiol's on the bay, and beyond it to the eastward as far aa Bridgehampton, and on the 30th observations were begun a.t Shinnecock Light-house.

Resurvey of shore-line on Long Island from Hog Neck to Riverhead, including the shore-line of N oyack, Little Peconic, and Great Peconic Bays; also of the ocean shore from Amagansett west'UJ41,rd.Soon after the beginning of the fiscal year, Ao;sistant C. T. Iardella proceeded under instructions to Sag Harbor, Long Island, wher:e, having organized his party, he took up a resurvey of the shoreline of Noyack Bay, from the limits of the work of the previous season executed by Assistant Charles Hosmer. Proceeding westward he continued the shore-line resurvey of Little Peconic and Great Peconic Bays, carrying the work as far as Riverhead on the west, and thence eastward to include Robbins's Island, Cutchogue Harbor, and the shore-line of Little Hog Neck. The area surveyed presents no features of special topographical interest. The shores are generally long sand beaches dotted with small bowlders. There are two large bowlders which are visible at quite a distance-one on the southeast end of Robbins's Island, distant four hundred and fifty feet from high-water mark; the other, five hundred and twenty-five feet from high-water mark, is nearly abreast of New Suffolk, and is known as Black Fish Hock; it stands about ten feet out of water at high tide, and can he seen plainly for nearly half a mile by vessels running into the harllOr. A short distance from this rock is another, just bare at low tide, where large quantities of black-fish are caugl1t. On October 31 field operations were closed. The statistics of the topography, which was exe· cuted ou a scale of 1-10000, are as follows: Miles of shore-line surveyed .... _................ -............... - . . . . . . . . 70 Miles of marsh-line surveyed ............................................ 21 :Miles of shore-line of creeks and ponds ............................·....... 18 Thliles of roads.-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 Area of sur.-ey, in square miles.................... . . . ·· . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9 During the winter Mr. Iardella was engaged in duty at the Office, and towards the end of .April was directed t<> organize his party for surveying the shore-line and adjacent topography at the east end of Long Island, and the ocean shore-line from .Amagansett westward. On tbe 9th of May he reached Sag Harbor, Long Island, where he organized his party, and on the 14th began a resurvey of the inner shore-line of Sag Harbor Cove. Having finished this work May 22, he took up the resurvey of the inner shore-line of Northwest Harbor and completed itJune6. Between that date and the end of the fiscal year the following surveys were made: the inner shore-line of Coccles Bay, the inner shore-line of West Bay Harbor, the outer shore or beach-line from Montauk Point to Amagansett Life-Saving Station, and the inner shore-line of .Aca.bomack Bay. The topographical sheets upon which this work was done were sheets that had been partially completed by .Assistant Hosmer in 1882, 1883, 1884. Mr. Iar<lella has included in his report descriptions of the several harbors within the limits of his work, which was executed on a scale of 1-1000.

Topographic resurvey on the south coast of Long Island from near Babylon to the 1cestward, and soundings in Fire Island Inlet.-In oruer to fill a gap in the topographical resurvey of the south coast of J,ong Island, and to obtain additional soundings needed at :Fire Island Inlet, .Assistant W. H. Dennis- organized a party, under instructions, dated June 25, 1887, and began field-work July 1, near Babylon, Long Island. The topography was carried from the shore back to the line of the Long Island Railroad, from Babylon to the westward, to and including Baldwin. The whole distance was almost a continuous village. On September 1, Mr. Dennis proceeded to Fire Island, made an examination of the bar at the inlet, and resurveyed the shore-line, taking also such soundings as were needed. He then resumed his topographical resurvey, and on the 7th of November completed it. At Flushing Bay, J,ong Island, and at Long Branch, N. J., he delineated on plane-table sheets the newly constructed piers. The statistics of the season are :

Physical hydrography of New York Bay and Harbor.-The under-run of tlte Hudson River; its relation to New York Bar.-In continuation of his investigations relating to the physical h;ydrography of New York Bay and Harbor, Assistant Henry l\iitchell has submitted a special report upon the under-run of the Hudson River, its relation to New York Bar, arnl upon the courses of the Hudson tides through New York Harbor. As the Annual Report for IR87 had not goue to press at the time this paper of .Mr. Mitchell's was presented, it was prepared for publication as .Appendix No. 15 of that report, and a synopsis of it given under the beading of special scientific work in Part I. It is only necessary, therefore, to refer to it here as bringing the subject of these investigations nearly to a close, leaving yet to be discussed the results of the physical surveys made by Assistant Marindin in New York Harbor in 1887. Oontinuati.on of physical hydrographio surveys in New York Bay and Hat:bor.-At the beginning of the fiscal year the physical hydrographic parties rn charge of Assistant Henry L. l\Iarindin had been organized on board the schooners Ready an<l Palinurv.s, with two steam-launches attached, and were engaged in making observations of the currents in the channels oyer Sand.)~ Ilook Bar, under instructions dated July 5, 1887. A report of the work accomplished by Mr. Mariudiu's party hefore the beginning of the fiscal year was given in the last Annual Report, with statistics up to June 30, 1887. The plan of work has been fully set forth in a memorandum prepared by Assistant Henry Mitchell. It was desired to have su~h observations of the currents over the bar at Sandy Hook made as would serve to derive the "Constants of Scour," with their co-efficients, and ascertain the "ooutrol" of the several channels. In carrying out this plan, the velocities and tlfrectious of the currents in the channel cross-sections WP.re to be observed, paying most attention to the currents flowing along the bottom. The instruments which had at first been used for this purpose were found to have certain objectionable features, which ultimately led to their abandonment and to the adoption, after several trials, of the new velocity and direction meters designed by Messrs. Ritchie and Haskell These new meters combine, in one instrument, .a means of registering by electricity the velocity of a current and the direction of its flow. The registration is made on the vessel's deck without removing the instrument from the water. While following the memorandum as closely as possible, transverse curves of velocities were obtained at the surface, mid·deptb, and bottom in the fourteen-feet channel in the East, in the Swash, and in the Main Ship Channels. These determinations were repeated wherever necessary,

38

UNI'l'ED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

and the channels were also' occupied longitudi11ally in order to ascertain the relation, if any, of velocity to profile of section. During the progress of the work at Sandy Hook, Mr. Marindin was directed to communicate with Subassistant J\foGratL, who was then engaged in rnnning a line of leveling of precision between the tidal stations in New York Bay nnd Harbor, and to make arrangements to be present when the reference of the tide-gauge and staff was to be made to the heuch-marks at the Horseshoe, Sandy Hook. This duty "\\as performed by Messrs. Marindin and McGrath early in August. Observations of the tides in connection with those at the Sandy Hook station were continued during the season at tlrn tide-gauge established on the steam-boat wharf, on Bath, Long Island. Data of a trustworthy character were thus secured for a discussion of the results of the work. On the 10th of August, in anticipation of the speedy close of the survey in :New York Harbor, and of the transfer of his party to Cape Cod, Mr. )larindin laid up the Palinurus and the launch accompanying and devoted a few days, with reduced force, to re-rating the current meters in the slack-water pond at''est Brighton, Staten Island, so as to ascertain the change of rate, if any, due to the use of tbe instruments during the month;:; preceding. The Really, with the remaining launch, was then laid up, and on the 18th of August field opera· tions were closed. Statistics of Mr. Marin<lin's work: in New York Harbor are included in those of bis work off Cape Cod Peninsula, a report of which has been given under a lwading in Section I. With his progress report of the New York Harbor work be has furnished a sketd1 showing the location of the current stationr.:;, the Jines of crosR-sections sounded, mid the location of the tide-gauges. Geo(letic levcUng for the conneotion of the tide-gauges ltnd bench-marks in New York Bay a-nd Harbor and ridnit.11.-Reference was ma<le in the last annual report to the transfer of the charge of geolletic leveling operations ou New York Bay arnl Harbor and. neighboring localities to Sub· assistant J. E. McGrath on .Tune 7, 188i. At that time the party was quartered at Clifton, Staten Island, and was engagetl in running lines connecting the tide-gauges and tidal bench-markt:i on the north shore of Staten Island with tht' main line of levels which was to extend from Sandy Hook, New ,Jersey, to Willets Point, East River, New York, crossing from Staten Island to Long Island at the Narrows. From a bench-mark in the secot.dary line of levels which was run around the north shore of Staten Islarnl, a branch line was startetl which crossed the Kill ,·au Kull at New Brighton, Staten Island, aml counectetl with the tide-gauge and tidal bench-mark of 188G at Constable's Ilook, ~ew Jersey. From a bench-mark on the Const~illle's Hook line, connection was matle by way of Bergen Neck with the lower end of JerRey City arnl with tiie tide-gauge established in 1..886 on the center of the bridge of the New Jersey Central Railroad, which crosses the Hackensack River near its mouth. Details of other connections made with tide-gauges and tidal bench-marks established in 1885 and 1886 at points on the shores of the Kill van Kull and of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays are given by Mr. McGrath in his report. A!Ro of the connections made with several bench-marks of the first section of the transcontinental line of geodetic leveling run by Assistant Braid in 1881 from Sandy Hook towanl Hagerstown, Md. Upon the completion of the work in New Jersey, by which trustworthy checks for all of the branch lines of leveling were obtained, the party was removed to New York City and the work begun of connPcting the tirle-ga.nges and tidal bench·marks along the Hudson River with the line of precise leveling extending from Sandy Hook t.o Willets Point. This was satisfact-0rily accomplished by the 5th of September, whereupon field operations were brought to a close, and Mr. McGrath proceeded under instructions t.o the Office t.o compute the results of his observations. A tabular statement accompanies Mr. McGrath's report, showing tl1e points connected, the distances run, and the probable error Jler kilomeh'r. Ile observes that tbe great heat of the sea· son delayed progress on some of the routes followed. Along the white sandy road-bed of the New York arnl Long Branch Railroad the advance was necessarily slow, as on account of the unusual refraction tlie length of sights on most of the working days between the hours of 9 a. m. and 3.80 p. m. had to be red need to one-third or even one-fourth of tbe distances obtained nncler more favor· a.ble circumstances. The number of water crossings also led to dela.y; these were the Narrows

(with a width of 1,420 meters), the Kill vau Kull, the Hackensack River, the Arthur Kill (crossed twice),Raritan Bay, and the Shrewsbury River. Mr. John Nelson was attached to the party as Aid, and rendered service which for faithfulness and efficiency_is highly commended. Mr. F. A. Young sernd acceptably as recorder. Duty subsequently assigned to Mr. McGrath is referred to under a heading in Section VIII. Continuation of tidal record from automatic Ude-gauge at San1ly Hook, NewJersey.-The pres· ent series of tidal observations at the station established for a self-registering tide-gauge, December 1, 1886, at Sandy Hook, was continued successfully throughout the year. J\lr. A. J. Brennan remained in charge until April 16, 1888, when he was relie·ecl by Mr. J. G. Spaulding, an ob· server of great experience and tried fidelity, who llad inst completed an eighteen-year series at an automatic tidal station in Penobscot Bay. Reconnaissance for connecting the triangulation in the southern part of the State of Pennsylvania with the primary triangulation in J1Jaryland.-A preliminary reconuaissance bad been undertaken under instructions by Prof. Louis Il. Barnard, Acting Assistant, soon after the beginning of the fiscal year, looking to a connection between the triangulation in Pennsylvania to the south and west of Harrislmrgh and Gettysburgh with the primary triangulatfon in western .Maryland. Professor Barnard bad outlined a connection between these triangulations as far as it could be done without erecting any signals, and with an instrumental outfit consisting of a draw telescope, azimuth compass, and azimuth barometer. In order to determine more definitely the conditions upon which the proposed connection could be economically and satisfactorily made, Assistant Joseph Hergesheimer was 'instructed on the 28th of July to take charge of the party, relieving Professor Barnard. Mr. Hergesheimer, finding it expedient to go over the whole ground, began his reconnaissance from the line Round Top-Pulpit Rock in Penns:ylvauia. Having rebuilt the tripod and scaffold at Uouud Top and the tripod at Pnlpit Rock, he opened the line from the last-named station to Sugar Loaf. While enga~d at Pulpit Rock, Professor Barnard, wl10 Lad remained witll the part_y, was sent to Piney Mountain to put that signal in order for observing. The rest of the season Mr. Her. gesheimer spent in visiting the points Clark's Knob, Fairvie.v, 1\Iaryland Ileights, Sugar Loaf, and Mount Quirauk to verify the intervisibility of the points, measure reconnaissance angles, and note the condition of the station marks. All of these stations, except the first named, are in .Maryland. Progress was greatly retarded by continuous thick, hazy weather, there having been but five days of fairly good seeing during tlle season, which closed Septew.ber 19. The scheme of triangulation submitted presents a satisfactory connection between the Pennsylvania and Maryland systems, Mount Quirauk, just south of the Pennsylvania boundary, being tlte central point from which the seven other stations of the scheme are all visible. During the winter and spring, Assistant Hergesheimerwas assigned to duty on the west coast of Florida, reference to which will l>e made nuder a heading iu Section VI. Physical hydrography.-l!'ormation and mo·vement of ice in Delaicare Bay and River, as observed during the winter of 1887-'88.-It appears from the thirtl annual report submitted by Assistant Spencer C. Mccorkle, in regard to the formation and movement of ice in Delaware River ancl Bay <luring the winter of 1887-'88, that the delays and dangers to navigation from this .source were of shorter duration and less in extent than in the previous winter; that they are gradually diminishing, and that the works of construction intended to deepen and widen the l'iver channels tend every year to make it easier for vessels to pass up aml down the river during the prevalence of ice. For the purposes of his observations, which were undertaken in pursnauce of instructions issned October 18, 1887, Mr. McOorkJe divided the river and bay into three sections, the first extending from Bridesbnrgh to Chester; the second from (Jhester to New Castle, and the third from New Castle to Cape Henlopen. In all of these sections were included observations made at Mr. McCorkle's request by the masters of city ice-boats, and by tl:ie captains of the Winsor line of Philadelphia and Boston steam.ships. In the first sootion were included also observations made by the Signal Service, U. S. Army, in Philadelphia, by the masters of the Philadelphia. and Rea.drng line of steam colliers, and by the

40

light-house keepers near the Horseshoe, at the mouth of the Schuylkill River, at Billingsport, and at Schooner Ledge. In the second section, observations were made also by the keepers of light-houses at or near Cherry Island Flats and Deep "\Yater Point, and in the third section by the light-house keepers at New Castle, Finn'8 Point, Reedy Island, Ship .John Shoal, Cross Ledge Shoal, and Brandywinf; Shoal; also by special observers at Fort Delaware and at Delaware Breakwater. Mr. McCorkle made observations personally in each of the sections. Ice began to form in the river on the 28th of December, but did not become much of a.n obstruction to navigation until January 23. Between that date and February 20 there was at times hen1·y ice in the river and bay, On February 20 the city ice-boats were laid up, and there was no ice of note after that date. In the section of the river from Bridesburgh to Chester, Mr. l\IcCorkle observed that during the whole period of freezing weather, with scarcely an exception, there was a clear streak of water on foe Pennsylvania shore, opposite the dike at Fisher's Poi]lt. As the ice was solid above and below, this 01>en water was doubtless due to the action of the dike iu causing a greater rapidity of the ehb current on the Pennsylvania shore. The channel to the eastward of Petty's Island was solill up to about February 20. From a short distance above the foot of Petty's Island to Gloucester the ice was nearly al ways in motion, and the city front was generally clear of ice. The exceptions were Y-ery few. From Gloucester to Chester the greatest obstructions were in the Horseshoe, as in previous years, and in the vicinity of Billingsport, where the channel decreases in width from about 3,300 feet aboYe to about 750 feet at the head of Tinicum Island, and to about 2,100 feet below. The engiueer iu charge of tlle improvements of the river suggests that the dike from Hog Island to Maiden Island will probably have the effect of removing a portion of the head of Tinicum Island, and thereby increase the width of the channel. Iu the second section, from Chester to :New Castle, there were only parts of days when the motiou of the ice was suspended. The greatest difficulty found in this section exists chiefly in the vicinit.r of Deep \Yater Point, where the river narrows and forms two cbunnels on either side of Cherry Island l<'lats. At Marcus Hook and New Castle, the ice-harbors afford good protection to vessels entering, hnt at New Castle the capacity of the l1arbor is greatly lessened by shoal water. l\Ir· .McCorkle is of opinion that the United States pier at this place might be extended with good results, aud that it would be of much advantage to have the light-house depot established here. Jn the third section, from New Castle to Cape Henlopen, the chief obstructions from ice occur in the eastern (or Ship) cha11nel, above Fort Delaware, and in the vicinity of the Ship John Shoal. The ebb passes out through the western chauuel, where the ice during the season was in constant motion, while in the eastern channel the aid of the ice-boats was frequently required, not, however, for full-powered steam-ships. Below Fort Delaware, to the capes, the ice was constantly in motion, and though unusuaily heav~', steam-ships were coust~1ntly moving up and down. .A.t Delaware Breakwater the harbor was full of ice between .Tanuary 22 and ,Tanuary 29, but uo damage to vessels was reported. Mr. .McCorkle passed down the river on January 20 on a light-draught steamer, and found considerable ice, bnt it caused little deteutiou. He was informed by the superintendent of the city ice-boats that the ice was at its worst on the 28th, 29th, and 30th of January, and between Chester and Philadelphia. During these days, several vessels were injured by ice, and some of thf'm seriously. The ice-boats, as well as the large steam-ships, go through the heaviest ice at almost full speed. Observations for the density an:d temperature of the water, for temperature of air, and ·of the tides W()ro made at Delaware Breakwater by an observer of the Philadelphia. Maritime Exchange, aud at Fort Delaware by William Byrnes, ordnance sergeant, U. S. A. The observations at Fort Delaware seemed to show that very little salt water gets that far np the river, bnt m order to determine the question, observations should he taken between the middle of August and the middle of September.

Mr. McCorkle acknowledges his indebtedness to Commander John J. Read, U. S. N., Inspector of the Fourth Ligl1t-House District, and tbrough him to the Ligbt-House Board, for co-operation in the work at twelve light-house stations on the river and bay. .Also to Henry Winsor & Co., of the Philadelphia and Boston Steam-ship Line, who furnished the log-books of their ships for inspection. To the Director of Public Works of the city, to the superintendent an<l other officers of the city ice-boats, and to the Philadelphia Maritime Exchange, be expresses his thanks for attentions shown and faci!Uies afforded in prosecuting his work . .Also to Lieut. Col. H. M. Robert, Corps of Engineers, U. S. A., antl through .him to William Byrnes, ordnance sergeant, U. S . .A., who made the observations at Fort Delaware. The regular duties assigned to Assistant Mccorkle in the charge of the Sub-office at Philadelphia during the year, are referred to toward the efld of Part JI of this volume. Geodetic operations.-Oontinuatio1i of reconnaissance and triangula.tion in the southern part of the State of New Jersey.-The geodetic operations referred to in the last annual report as in prog· ress in southwestern New Jersey, under the direction of Prof. E. A. Bowser, Acting Assistant, were continued after the beginning of the fiscal year until September 26, 1887. On the 1st of July, but a few days' observations were needed to complete the occupation of station Uichland, which had been begun on June 2. On July 13, Richland station having been finished, the party and instruments were transferred to Newfield, a point about three and a balfmiles in a northerly direction from Vineland, N. J. The signals at Hammonton and Kellogg were re-adjusted; a signal was erected at Richland; lines were run from Newfield to Hammonton, Williamstown, and Bridgeton for locating vistas, and these vistas were opened. At Bridgeton a signal was put up fifty feet iu height, and the signal at Williamstown was raised eight feet. A reconnaissance which ha<l heen partly executed at the outset of the season was then resumed, its object being to determine a station twelve or fifteen miles to the west of Newfield, that would see Bridgeton,.. Newfield, and Williamstown, and that would also command a good view of the country to the north, west, aml south. Colson station was finaily selected, and a signal erected there seventy-two feet high. Measure. ments of horizontal angles were in the mean time continued at Newfield whenever the weather would permit. On .August 30, a granite monument was set to mark the station point. This monument is four feet long, dressed six inches square at one end for a length of six inches, and is set in hydmulic cement to within six inches of the top. It has the letters U. S. cut in each of the four faces, and a triangle on top. Upon the completion of the observations at Newfield toward the end of September, field-work was discontinued for the season. Professor Bowser reports that the reconnaissance for the selection of stations in the south· western part of the State is very difficult, owing to the exceeding flatness of the country and the extensive areas of thick, tall timber, much of it being ninety and one hqndred feet high. High scaft'blds will have to be built when stations Williamstown, Bridgeton, and Colson are occupied, and lines of sight opened through the intervening woodR. With a more liberal appropriation for State sul·veys, the progress of the work would be more rapid and its cost in the end be less. Between the beginning of the fiscal year and the close of the season there were taken twentyeight sets of observations upon four primary points, and two sets upon two tertiary points at station Richland. Sixty-one sets of' observations wern taken at station Newfield upon six primary points, and twenty-two sets upon twelve tertiary points. All of the stations occupied for observations of horizontal angles have been carefully marked.

Determinations of gravity at the Smitlisonian Institution, W asliington, in connection with similar determinations in the Hawaiian Islands and in California.-A full abstract is given under the bead· ing "Special operations," and mention made under a beading in Section X of the gravity work executed during the fiscal year by Subassistant E. D. Preston, at the Hawaiian Islands and in California, the work at the Hawaiian Islands having been done in pursuance of a special assign· ment to this duty, made at the request of the Hawaiian Government and by direction of the Sec· -retary of the Treasury. Upon the completion of these observations at the Rtations in California, Mr. Preston pro· ceeded under instructions to Washington, and early iu December made preparations for a series of comparative determinations of gravity by pendulum experiments at the station at. the Smith· sonian Institution. In this work, which was executed between December9 and 22, 1887, he had tbe aid of Assistant J. B. Baylor. Magnetic determinations (annual) ai a station on Capitol Hill, Washington, D. C.-The reasons which led to the abandonment of the locality occupied since 1877 on Capitol Hill, Washington, for an annual determination of the magnetic elements, were stated in the last annual report. At the new station, selected, under the direction of Assistant Schott, in the grounds immediately south of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, determinations of the magnetic dip, declination, aud horizontal intensity were made by Assistant J.B. Baylor ou July 28, 29, and 30, 1887, the direction of the true meridian having been previously obtaiued b~' observations on the sun on tl1ree days. To secure this point, it was marked by a solid white-oak post, ~lriven fi11sh with the ground, a copper tack being driven into its center. The position thus marked is within a few meters of the magnetic station occupied by Mr. 8cbott in 1850. Ou June 19 and 20, 1888, the station was re-occupied by .Mr. Baylor. The results show that the observations are normal. Cont-inuation of the detailed topogrnphical survey of the ])i.~trirt of Col11rnl>ia.-At the beginning of the fiscal Jear, the field-work in continuation of the detailed topographical imrvey of the Dis· trict of Columbia was dividell between two parties, one of tl!e!'ie being placed in charge of ARsistant John '.V. Donn, who had conducte<l the survey from the outset, and the charge of the other beinir assigned to Assistant W. C. Ilodgkins. Mr. Donn began work July 1, 1887, in the northeastern section of the District, the triangula· tion points upon which his survey in that locality depeuded being Bunker Hill, Hoover's Hill, and Reform School. Some uew points had to be determined before the plane-table work could proceed to advantage. On July 9 the topography was begun, and as the summer aud fall were favorable to progress, all of the open ground was completed before the trees were cleared of leaves, not only in the section in which the season's work was begun, but also in that to which the party was trans· ferred later in the season, on the eastern branch of the Potomac. There were several large areas of woods within the limits of the two sheets. One area of one hundred acres wa.s exceedingly difficult, having been abandoned at the close of the civil war to nature, which covered it with thickets of black pine, cedar, and bramble. In November it became practicable to carry the work through this region. A still larger body of woods on the west side of the Anacostia River could not be reached before field operations were necessarilJ sus· pernled. During tl1eir progress, the preparation of section drawings for the photolitbographer was continu(jd by Mr. Donn, and by his Aid, Mr. J. A. Flerner, at every favorable opportunity. Two of these sections were finished, and about three-fourths of a third section. fn reforeuce to the statistics of his survey, Mr. Donn observes that while be transmits them on the usual forms he includes an item whiQh he regards as the most important feature in large-scale

work as well as the most difficult, namely, the lengths of contour lines instrumentally determined. For this he submits the following statement: From the beginning to the end of the season, July 1toDecember13, one hundred and twentyfive and six-tenths working days, a contoured area of one thousand seven hundred aud eigbtyeight acres was delineated, involving two hundred and thirty-seven miles of contoured lines, an average of one and eighty-eight one-hundredtlls miles per day. A comparison of this result with the work accomplished during the latter part of the preceding year, wben the party was transferred from the western to the eastern division of the district, is as follows: From March 16 to May 9, thirty-eight working days, five hundred and forty-six and five-tenths acres, and seventy-two and two-tenths miles of contour lines, a daily aYerage of one and nine-tenths miles. Average number of acres completed daily from February, 1881, to l\fay, 1887, was nine and three-tenths acres, at a cost of $1.9G ver acre. For the period from July 1, 1887, to December 13, 1887, the average was twelve and six-tenths acres daily, at a cost of $1.121 per acre. Marshy areas are not included in tbe estimates of averages, contour work only being considered. These differences in the cost and iu the results fairly show the relative difficulties of the work in the two divisions, $1.96 per acre representi11g the western and $1. 12! the eastern.

The scale of the survey is as l!eretofore, 1-4800. During the rest of the fiscal year Mr. Donn was engaged in advancing office-work on the field sheets. Continuation of the detailed topographical s1tr1Jey of the District of Columbia.-In the preceding paragraphs reference was made to the placing of two topograpllical parties in tlle field at the beginning of the fiscal ;year to continue the detailed survey of the District of Uolumbia. The party of Assistant W. C. Hodgkins began work July 1 iu the uortheastern part of the District, extending from the Brentwood road to the left bank of the Eastern Branch. Operations of a preliminary nature occupied almost entirely the montll of July. Liues of lev-els were run to obtain a sufficient number of bench-marks for ready use in the topograpliy, and additional triangula· tion points were determined where needed. Intense beat during July and August somewhat retarded progress; delay was caused also by the necessity of training a new party to the special duties of this detailed survey. The field-work was steadily prosecuted, however, until the exhaustion oftlrn appropriation, in March. Several quite difficult areas of woods w'ere included in the region surveyed, such as those on the Brentwood and adjoining estates, and :Mouut Olivet Cemetery and surroundings, especially that portion betweeu Mouut Olivet and the Eastern Branch, which is very steep, broken into numerous ravines, and densely wooded. The marshy tracks above and below Benning's bridge, although admitting of more rapid work than the intricate contouring just mentioned, yet presented some special difficulties owing to the extremely soft character of the mud, especially south of the bridge, where holding ground could hardly be obtained for the plane table, while, on account of the width of the marshes, it was impossible to do a.11 the work from the hard land. These ma.rshes, Mr. Hodgkins observes, are said to be increasing in elevation by deposit from the stream, especially on the western shore of the branch at a. point where the great intercepting sewer empties itself. Mr. R. E. Nelson,jr., as levelman, and Mr. Eberhard Forda.n, as rodman, rendered faithful service.

Topographic and hydrographic resurveys on the eastern shores of I>elaware, Maryland, and Yirginia.-Uuder instructions dated August 18, 1837, Assistant D. B. Wainwright took up topographic work which involved a resurvey of the inlam1 waters on the eastern shores of Delaware, Maryla11d, and Virginia, beginning at Little Assowoman Bay, in Delaware, and extending to and including the upper portion of Chincoteague Bay, in Maryland, the resurvey of Chincoteague Inlet and Bar, and the resurvey of the bays and thoroughfares to a point twenty miles below. Mr. Wainwright has submitted a descriptive report to accompany the hydrographic sheet @bowing the results of his resurveys. With regard to the changes that have taken place at Chincoteague Inlet and vicinity since the survey of 1881, he observes that the bar is somewhat north of its position at that date as shown on the chart published in 1882. It is situated between the point of Fox and Richardson's shoals, which are separated here three-eighths of a mile, aud consists of two channels and a middle ground. The channel on the northeast side, alljoining Fox Shoal, has a depth at mean low water of from eight and a half to nine feet. The other, on the southwest side, adjoining Richardson's Shoal, bas a depth of seven feet. On the middle ground tberlj is six feet. The outer edge of the bar, especially near the middle ground, is quite steep, as it rises in a short distance from depths of twelve and fourteen feet to seven and six. The bar is subject to frequent changes laterally, and consequently the buoys do not always show the best water. It is generally reported that the bar increases in depth to at least one foot after a northwest blow of several days' duration. There are no pilots, as strangers rarely enter the inlet, and the masters of the few small schooners trading in the vicinity keep themselves "Well informed as to changes in progress. Mr. Wainwright gives the following local names for insertion on later editions of the charts of that locality: New Inlet, the mouth of the Eastern Channel; Fox Shoal, north side of bar and cbanuel; Richardson's Shoal, south side of bar and channel, and Gunboat Drain, a slough which makes out around the north point of Wallop's Island. On February 29, 1888, the survey having been finished, Mr. Wainwright was directed to report at the Office for duty in completing his records. The statistics are :
Number Number Number Number of of of of miles of shore-line surveyed ............................. . 19 miles of soundings run . _............................... . 487 angles observed . _. _...... _................·............. 1, 1:151 soundings .......... _......... __ .......... ___ ... _.. _.... . 26,930

Towards the end of March he was instructed to take up work for the cormection of certain detached triangulations on the coast of North Carolina. This service will be referred to under a heading in Section JV. CompwtiQn of the tria1igulation in the vicinity of Cape Charles, Yirginia.-Brief mention was made in the last annual report of the progress of the triangulation of Cape Charles, Virginia, and vicinity, which was in course of execution by Subassistant R. A. Marr under instructions issued towards the clm;e of April, 1887. On account of the shifting nature of the outside islands, and the changes reported of the inside channels and mud flats, Mr. Marr deemed it advisable to insure permanent points on the main-land for future use by running a double chain of quadrilaterals on the sea-coast. Some marked changes since the last survey were noted. Cobb Island has made out on the south end, and lost on the middle and upper portions; Eone and Wreck Islands are connected, tbe channel which divided them having filled without leaving an indentation in the sand ridge to show where it bad been ; Little Inlet bas shoaled and narrowed considerably ; Smith's Islancl (Cape Obarles) has lost a great deal ; the site of the old light house is about one hundred and ninety-seven feet at sea, and a break water has been built to protect the new one; the Isaacs and Fisherman Islands have made, and the Chesapeake Bay side has lost by erOBion.

Acoompanying Mr. Marr's report is a description with illustrative photograph of his instrument and stand, showing his method of mountiug both to attain greater stability. Three stubs, about two feet long, were driven into tile ground at equal distances from the center of a station and at angles of inclination in the direction of the legs of the tripod. Pointed shoes were then inserted in small holes in the tops of the stubs, and tapped until they stood firmly ; then three cross-pieces were inserted in the split legs of the tripod, and a large stone or a bag of sand placed upon them. The weight of the stone or sand bag was far within the limit of strain, and a tew light blows of the hand upon the stand before beginning to observe would reduce the strain to an almost constant pressure. By this method the center of gravity of the stand and instrument is brought below the center of figure, and the stability of the stand at least is assured, especially if a platform is constructed for the observer. This can be be made of three boards supported only at the ends.

Special hydrographyfor the State of North Carolina completed.-The surv-eys and explorations of oyster beds for the State of North Carolina, made at the request of the State authorities, which have been carried on since March, 1886, by Lieut. Francis Winslow, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the schooner Scoresby, were completed towards the close of the fiscal year. All of the natural beds have been located, and the examination of the important areas has been finished. The attention called by the surveys to the value of oyster culture bas led to the preemption of the more valuable areas, and numerous inquiries and requests for information have been received by Lieutenant Winslow. He reports that one result of his surveys has been to add forty thousand acres to the area of productive oystier fields. Additions to tke tria"!lulation, topography, and kydrograph'JI on tke coast of North Carolina betwee. Beaufort and Cape Fear.-In accordance with instructions issued toward the close of March, 1888, Assistant W. C. Hodgkins proceeded to Beaufort, N. C., and organized a party for supplying certain needed additions to the triangulation, topography, and hydrography Qn the North Carolina coast between Beaufort and Cape Fear.

Work was begun April 11 at Bogue Inlet. l\lucb difficulty was experienced in recovering the marks of the old triangulation. While this search was being prosecuted, advantage was taken of favorable opportunities for making such topographic and hplrographic surveys as were required to show the changes that had occurred. Tidal observations were also kept up at Bogue Inlet for more than a month. After two of the old points, "Hammock" atHl "Humphreys," had been recovered, they were connected by quadrilaterals with a base-line which was measured on the sea-beach between Bogue and Bear Inkts, this portion of the coast being known as Bear Banks. At Humphreys station observations for azimuth were made, and the mark connected with the triangulation. Upon the completion of work in this Yicinity, 1\fr. Hodgkins transferred his party to New River, North Carolina, where three of tlie oltl stations were soon recovered, signals erected, and angles rneaomred for connecting them with a clteck base-line laid out on the sand beach west of New River folet. Station Cauatlay on foe bluff bank, west side of New Hiver, near the old station McMillan, was occupied for observations of azimuth, and measurements made for connecting the mark with the points of the triangulation. As opportunity offered, a topographical resurvey of the inlet was executed to show the changes tltat have occurred from the gradual shifting of tlte bar, and also the new canals that have been cut through the marshes by tl1e U. S. Engineer:;. A limited amount of hydrograpby was done also, to show the depth of water over the bar and up the channel to the ancliorage. In tl1is hydrography allfl also in tl1e hase.mrasnrt'ment, Mr. Hodgkins had the C',O·Operation of Assistant D. B. Wainwright, whose work on anotl1er portion of tlrn North Carolina coast will be adverted to in the next heading. 'l'he New River work was practically finished at the \'nd of Jnne, bnt the preliminary computatiom· having shown unexpectedl;r large differences between tbc measured and computed distances, effort was at once made to lliscover tlm source of tl1c discrepancies, and it was found that t11e station occupied as Swan Poiut was not the old point, but one about twenty foet from it, established by the North Carolina Oyster Survey. Tbe necessary remeasureruents were theu made, aud tile survey at New Rh-er eompleterl ,lnl,y 14. During the stay of the party at New River continuous tidal observations were kept up at \Vriglit's Island, near the inlet. Two other reli!urn~~·li! were made before closing field operations, one at Brown's Inlet and the other at Bear Inlet. This last named work was finished July 23, and next day the party was transferred to Beaufort on the way north. The work having been brought to a close but a few weeks later than the end of the fiscal year, the entire abstract of its progress has been included iu this year's annual report. Other duty executed hy ARsistant Hodgkins is referred to under a heading in Section III. Connection of old irith new triangulation on the coast of North Carolina, and resurveys on that coast fro1n JJfasonboro Inltt toward8 New River lnlet.-Early in April, 1888, Assistant D. B. Wainwright was instructed to proceed to tlle coast of N ortll Caroli11a and organize a party to check the triangulation in the vicinity of Masonboro Inlet, and thence northeastward in other localities to. wards New Hiver Inlet. Difficulty had been experienced the year before in recovering old stations, and this year, immediately after arrfring on the ground, Mr. Wainwright visited the sites of all the old stations on the main shore, hut without success until Big Pond, near what is now called Carolina Beach, was reached. Here, having found two of the former stations, he laid out a scheme of small triangulation, and made the necessary angular measurements, combiniug them with a base measure to join the scheme of the previous year, reference to which was made in the last annual re1iort. After completing this piece of work, he proceeded to check t11e triangulation at Sloop Point, where the two stations which were recovered were connected with a check base measured by wire UJIOn the beach. Observations for azimuth at one of the stations were made on three nights. The shore.line in the vicinity of Barren, Queen, Wch, Led berry, Old To1lsail, New Topsail, and Stump Inlets was resurveyed, and such soundings taken as were practicable. Towards the end of June Mr. Wainwright went to New River Inlet to co.operate with Assistant

Hydrograpkic survey of St. Simon's Bar, Georgia.-Lieut. J.E. Pillsbury, U.S. N., Assistant, commanding the steamer Blake, has communicated to the Office the results of his survey of St. Simon's Bar, Georgia, executed nuder instructions dated April 2, 1888. He reports that the bar is changing rapidly, the North Breaker Shoal making to the south· ward, and the lumps at the shoaler parts increasing iu height. This movement he thinks is im· mediately preliminary to the breaking out of a new channel at some point radically different from that now in use. Vessels of over fourteen feet draught should wait for a rising tide to cross the bar, and those of twenty or twenty-one feet draught for high-water spring-tides. The dredged channel to the port of Brunswick, Lieutenant Pillsbury states, is of but small value now, as it seems to be filling up. Four passageg through it on the Engineer's ranges, which are now used by the pilots, gave a depth at low water of not over eleven fePt. The single through cut of the dredge was originally made to fourteen feet, but it is so narrow tllat it is extremely difficult to find the greatest depth that now remains on it. At most of the wharves of Brunswick there is a depth equal to the draught of vessels crossing the bar. This abstroot is taken from a descriptive report submitted by Lieutenant Pillsbury to accompany his bydrograpbic sheet.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The scheme laid out in his instructions included an examination in nearly mid-Atlantic, about seven hundred miles northeast of Barbados Island, for the purpose of discoveringwhethl'ran Atlantic flow exists outside of the limits of the trade-winds. After steaming nine days, the Blake reached her objective point in about latitude 2so north and lougitude 47° west. Here she laid-to four days in a strong northwest gale and high seas, and, as the weather showed no signs of improvement, the proposed examination was reluctantly abandoned, and the steamer beaded for Barbados. Within a few days after reaching that island, observations of currents in the Equatorial Stream, between Barbados and Tobago, were begun, and seven anchorages were made in this passage. Other anchorages were made between all the islands from Trinidad to Antigua, and in the Anegada, Mona, and ·windward Passages. The results obtained at these various anchorages were of such importance, and, at times, so much at variance with preconceh·eu ideas, that Lieutenant Pillsbury has deemed it inadvisable to complete their discussion until the results of a second year's cruise in the same localities can be made available. He will therefore postpone the preparation of a report upon the subject until he has at his command the data ilerfred from his observations during the season of 1889. The officers who served on the Blake during the season were Ensigns N. J. Halpine, R. M. Hughes, A.. G. Rogers,C. S. Stan worth, and J.E. Shindal, U.S. N.; Passed AssistantEngineerG. W.

Hydrograpllic surveys on the west coast of Florida from Pavilion Key to Cape Sable, and thence to Sandy Key and Key West.-The work executed by the hydrographic party on the steamer Bache, on the west coast of Florida and approaches, in the winter and spring of 1888, forms the subject of two descriptive reports submitted by Lieut. J. F. Moser, U.S. N., Assistant. These reports contain full information respecting the hydrographic characteristics of the area under survey, the available anchorages, prevailing winds, e:ffectR of tides and currents, etc., and present also suggestions in regard to surveys of the waters between the keys east of Key West, which will have much weight as coming from an officer of Lieutenant Moser's long experience in hydrographic service and thorough comprehension of its requirements. Having refitted the steamer at Baltimore, the part.v left in her for Key West .January 3, arri~ed at that port January IO, and after coaling and taking on board signal lumber and stores, was ready a day or two later to proceed to the working ground. Delay was caused by a heavy norther, but on January 16 the steamer reached Pavilion Key, and field ·operations were begun. The area t-0 be covered by the survey was included in the limits from Pavilion Key (about · twenty-one miles sout.heast of Cape Romano) to Cape Sable, thence to Sandy Key, crossing the Bay of Florida to Lemon or East Bahia Honda Key, and from that point along the line of Bay Keys to Northwest Channel at Key West, and seaward to the ten-fathom curve. Over this area the work was prosecuted vigorously until its completion, May 10, thus finishing the last gap remaining in the coast hydrography from Eastport, Maine, to the Delta of the Mississippi. For the first four weeks the weather was favorable, and progress rapid, but during the rest of the season there were frequent northers, and the intervals between these were filled in by strong easterly winds, amounting at times to heavy gales. The triangulation along the coast as far as Cape Sable having been finished daring the year preceding, and most of the signals still standing, this wa.8 of much advantage in the prosecution of the hydrography, but in making the connection between Cape Sable and the easternmost key

of the group to the eastward of Key West, it became necessary to re-establish points on that group from such marks of the triangulation of 1856-1858 as could be recovered. A few of these were found after diligent search; their positions carefully re-marked and descriptions furnished for office use. Between Pavilion Key and Cape Sable there are several shallow tortuons._channels from four to six: feet in depth, leading between the keys towards the main-land; to these Lieutenant Moser calls attention as perhaps deserving of development after the topography has been done. The most important of these are the entrances to Lostman's River, Rodgers River, and Shark River. The slope of the bottom is very regular between Pavilion Key and Cape Sable, or, as it is more generally known in the locality, East Cape. The depths increase gradually to the ten-fathom curve. Off East Cape the bottom becomes irregular, and this irregularity increases in a line towards East Bahia Honda Key or Lemon Key. From thence to Content Key, and seaward to the three-fathom curve it is very nrnch broken. Shoals awash, or nearly so, at low water are numerous, and extensive banks dry at low water may be found five and six miles from shore. Narrow, tortuous channels intervene, ending in cul-de-sacs, or spread out over great areas of very sbaUow water. There are also many holes with three or four fathoms of water. The survey of these waters was difficult and laborious, as no land could be seen from the outer shoals. J,ieutenant Moser succeeded, however, in locating signals on the shoals, and, from these and a few water signals, in fixing his lines of soundings. From Content Key to the Northwest Passage at Ke;y West the bottom again assumes a regular form, the three-fathom curve approaching the shore line within a mile. Several shallow channels pass through the line of reefs conuecting the Bay Keys. 'Vitl1 regar(l to these Lieutenant l\Ioser observes that if it is desirable that these channels shonl<l be surveyed, it can only be done advantageously from an inside position, and in ayessel adapted for the purpose. Whatever channels exist, run across the line of keys in a north and south direction, and do not communicate in an east and west direction. There are two main channels running from the reefs to the Gulf, which are used by small vessels, and which should be thoroughly surveyed. One called the Spanish Key Channel, which runs from Bahia Honda, west of Big Spanish Key and east of Harbor Island into the bay, the entrance of which, as far as Big Spanish Key, was tra.versml by the party; the other Knight Key Channel, which runs west of Knight Key, and thence between banks, entering the bay east of Baitia Honda Key. From the reefs to Mayo's Key the Spanish Key Channel is broad, deep, and wide, but from thence to the Gulf it varies in depth and becomes narrow and tortuous. About six feet can be carried through this channel. The work did not touch upon the Knight Key Channel ; it was reported, however, that seven feet could be carried through it. From Pavilion Key to East Cape the keys have a thick growth and are so blended that the appearance is that of a co11tinuous shore-line, the entrances being apparent only on a very close approach. There are no marked prominent features such as would enable a stranger to distinguish one portion of the coast from another. Pavilion Key is more prominent on approaching from a westerly point, and has a saud '"' beach on the western side. On Lostman's Key there is a beach along the entire Gulf face. .A beautiful beach extends from North Cape to East Cape. There are several small buildings at .Middle Cape, with the roofs painted red and a promin_ent palm tree back of the houses. At East Cape there are two small buildings with red roofs. Between Middle Cape and East Cape is a dwelling, and back of it a grove of palms, which is conspicuous and a good land-mark. The Bay Keys from Northwest Channel to the eastward are quite similar in appearance,. differing chiefly in size, but as these keys, as far as Content Key, can be aJlproachecl very closely with deep water, and as they are not so thickly clustered, their sbapes are more rea<lily made out. The timber has been thinned out for use at Key West. Sawyer Key has a sand beach along the Gulf ·face. The beat guide on approaching the coast is the lead, and it is a safe guide, except on the broken ground before referred to. , A sa.fe anchorage. is· afforded by the .shallow water of the coast in any weather except a hurricane. During' the cruise'of the Bache the prevailing winds were easterly and the heaviest gales were llQrthers and southeaster&

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIU SURVEY.

With regard to the tides, Lieutenant Moser observes that they form a very important factor in the hydrography of that coast, and he urges the importance of establishing a permanent tidal station at some well selected point on the west coast of Florida. Special attention was given to careful tleterminations of tidal action within the area of the survey. At some point of the work, from the day of opening until the close of the season, a continuous series of day and night tides was observed. Three principal tidal stations were established, one on Lostman's Key, one on Cape Sable (East Cape), and one on Content Key; at each of these, observations were kept up during forty-six, forty-four, and twenty-nine days, respectively. Five comparison gauges were established also, two of these being off.shore in five and seven fathoms water. At these off.shore stations a Batchelder pressure-gauge was used, which worked perfectly. Observations for currents were made also. Since the data obtained by tl1e tidal reductions relate to a hydrograpbic survey covering an area in which the extremes differed as much as four lionrs in time and several feet in rise and fall, this area was laid out in blocks in order to make the reductions apply as accurately as possible, each block having special reference to a central station. These blocks were graded one into the other, so that at no points were the differences greater than one-half hour in time, or four-tenths of a foot in rise and fall. Lieutenant Moser has appended to his report full notes descriptive of each block, with the methods of reduction ernplo_yed; the limits of tlie blocks he has indicated on ~he sounding sheets. The abstract here given recites merely the salient points of the report with reference chiefly to their bearing upon the immediate objects of the hydrographic survey; other topics of interest discusse(l in it, relatfre to the geological formation of the coast, the fisheries, etc., must, for want of space, be omitted.

Dut~· assigned to Lieutenant Moser earlier in the fiscal year is referred to under a heading in Section I. Topographical survey of the 1ccsf coast of Florida between Pavilion Key and Gape Romano.The prevalence of yellow fever at Tampa and Manatee, on the west coast of Florida, in the autumn and early part of tbe winter of 1887, delayed the resumption of the topographical survey of that coast till January, 1888. Under instructions dated towards the end of December, 1887, Assistant .Joseph Hergesheimer arrived at Manatee, Fla., and organized his party on board the schooner Qiiick. Messrs. J. H. Gray, Aid, R. J. Meigs, Recorder, and Atlee Johnson, foreman, reported for duty at Fogartyville, Manatee River, on January 18. Having fitted tbe schooner for sea, the Quick reached the working ground February 2, and

was anchored off Indian Key. Plane-table work was begun February 4. The survey covered the coast from Pavilion Key to Cape Romano, a distance of thirty-one statute miles, and included within its limits the outside line of keys, with the adjacent bays and harbors for a belt of from one to two miles in width. The line of reef or rocks on the outside islands was all surveyed at low water. Mr. Hergesheimer reports that he found Mr. Gmy to be a careful, correct, and rapid topographer.

Continuation of the reconnaissance and triangulation for connecting the primary triangulation near Atlanta with that of the Gidf.-For the continuation of tbe reconnaissance and triangulation for extending an oblique arc of the meridian towards the Gulf of Mexico by connecting the work near Atlanta, Georgia, with that on the Gulf, Assistant F. W. Perkins took the field about the 1st of lj'ebrnary, 1888. Although his instructions had been issued the middle of December, it was deemed inadvisable to begin operations until most of the unfavorable weather so prevalent in that section during the winter had ceased. The reconnaissance was taken up in Alabama in latitude 33° 20', and carried south by means of two figures of good condition to latitude 32° 16'. Mr. Perkins obserrns that the most laborious part of the work in the northern figure had been done by Assistant Tittmann, who had had charge of the work during the preceding season. Lowndesborough, in Lowndes County, Alabama, was the most southern point selected. From thence southward, although the country is very flat, figures of good size can probably be obtained by careful studies of its peculiarities. Towards the end of March, heavy floods put a period to the reconnaissance, and retarded much the work of preparing for occupation the stations that had been selected. The condimon of the roads and streams made such long detours necessary that observations were not begun until the last week in April, a month having been consumed in work that, under more favorable circumstances, could have been done in a fortnight. Stations Laurel and Horn were completed, and about one-half of the observations necessary at Weogufka had been made, when, on the 1st of June, it became necessary to disband the party owing to the exhaustion of the funds available for this survey. Mr. Perkins expresses his obligations to Mr. W. B. Fairfield, extra. observer, whose skill in reconnaissance made his services of exceptional value.

Under a beading in Section XIV, reference is made to duty executed by Mr. Perkins earlier in the :fiscal year. Survey of the 1lfobile Ri1·cr fmm Spani.sh Rfrer to tlte junction of AlalJa,ma and Tombigbee llivers.In order to obtain data for a useful chart of :Mobile m,·er, l\lr. J. ll. 'rnrner, Aid, was instructed in January, 1888, to make a rapid survey of that rin>r from the limits of the topographical sheets at Spanish River, near Mobile, up to and including the junction of the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers. The topography along tbe river banks ·only was to be delineated, all the blt'tffs and their heights being shown, and special attention was to be gi,·en to the hydrograpby. Mr. Turner has sul.nnitted full reports of bis sur>ey, arranged as special and descriptive reports relating to the triangulation, topogmphy, and hydrograp9y. The work was completed between January 2.3 and April 30. Acknowledgment is made to Maj. A. N. Damrell, U. S. Engineers, for his kindness in loaning a steamer specially adapted for the snr>ey. Also to the people of Mobile for the interest they manifested. It had been originally intended to make the preliminary triangulation with the plane-table, but this plan proved upon examination not to be practicable, as the country bordering upon the river is, with few exceptions, a hea>ily wooded swamp, the trees overhanging the banks. Recourse was accordingly had to a small triangulation, extending in a chain of quadrilaterals from the Spanish Rirnr to the limits of the survey, the distances apart of tlie signals varying with the width of the ri>er, from forty to four or five hundred meters, the angles being measured by sextants; short bases measured at interntls frequent enough to supply suitable checks, and azimuths carried up the riYer by axial lines. All of the azimuth angles were measured with a six.inch theodolite~ and three stations were occupied for obsen-ations for azimuth on the sun, one at Spanish River, oue at Twenty-one Mile Bluff, and one at Mount Vernon Lauding. These observations were made with a three·inch alt-azimuth. The length of riYer covered by the triangulation was forty miles. As heayy and expe11si.-e cutting would liaYe been required in using the plane-table, it was employed only where tile high pine Iamh; touched the river, forn1ing blufls; these were carefully mapped. In other parts of the ifrer the shore-line being >cry regular, it was sketched in between the station;.;, and all irregularitic;.; were noted. The yarious bayous were explored for sl10rt distances. The hydrograpliy was executed by running lines of soundings at right angles to the axis on ranges from signal to signal, and at distances apart of one hundred meters, connecting these lines by diagonals. This plan was carried out till towards the end of the season, when a limitation as to time compelled the substitution of stream liues, with normals at greater intervals. The soulld· ings showed that, contrary to general report, the river was riingularly free from shoals, the channel being comparatiYely broad and sharply defined throughout its entire length. Between Spanish Hiver aml the junction of the Alabama and Tombigbee, but two bulwarks occur, and on these the rlepth is seventeen feet. The shoals which OC<lur in the angles of the bends do not extend far enough from shore to be dangerous to navigation. Mr. E. M. Talcott served as I{ecorder in the party. .Mr. Turner acknowledged his indebtedness to him for faithful and energetic service, and for many rn1uable suggestions which contributed to the accuracy of the work.

The hydrography was plotted upon the topographic sheets; there are therefore nine sheets in all. During the first five months of the fiscal year ~Ir. Turner was on duty in the party of Assistant Eimbeck, in Utah. Reference to his work there is made under a heading in Sectiou XVI. Lines of geodetw leveling run between the llfississippi River and Little Rock, A.rkansas.-The organization of a party for connecting by lines of spirit leveling of precision the city of Little Rock, Ark., with a bench-mark of the Mississippi River system of geodetic leveling, was intrusted to Subassistant J. E. McGrath by instructions issued towards the end of September, 1887. Upon reaching Little Rock, he was directed to communicate with Prof. J. C. Branner, Director of the Geological Survey of Arkansas, and consult with him with reforence to the route to he followe<l, antl, before taking up the work, to make a thorough reconnaissance of the several routes by which tlie r·iver might be reached from Little Rock. Mr. McGrath arrivecl in Little Rock on October 16, arnl, after seeing Professor Branner, made au examination of three routes, each of which would enable him to connect. lines of geodetic leveling from that city with a primary bench-mark of the Mississippi Hiver Commission. The route finally adopted was that of the Little Rock, Mississippi River and Texas Railroad from Little Rock to Arkansas Citr, on the Mississippi River. 'rhis road runs· through a high and rocky stretch of country from Little Hock to Pine Bluff, a distancP- of about forty-three miles; it then descends into the low lands, but in a belt which is entirely above overtlow until Trippe Junction, a station seven miles west of Arkansas City, is reached. From Trippe the road runs down to the river on a well built, substantial embankment, one which has not been owrfiowed for three years. 'l'he high grade of this line, its shortness- (ono hundred antl fourteen miles), as compared with the other two lines, its small amount of trestle-work, and the convenience it offered to the party in getting to and from their work, made it the most favorable route, and its termination at a point near Wilkerson's Lan<ling, on the Mississippi River, was also au advantage, as this point was much nearer Greenville, the end of the Coast and Geodetic Survey line of precise leveling on the Mississippi, than points at either Helena (Arkansas) or Memphis would han~ been. Owing to the possible prevalence of wet and stormy weather late in tlie season, it was decided to work westward after a crossing of the river had been effected. The first work done was iu compliance with Professor Branner's request to make a crossing of the Arkansas River at Little Rock, and connect the east monument of the U.S. Engineers' base near the river bank with the primary bench-marks in the city. The party was then transferred. to the east end of the line, and, having started at the permanent bench-mark of the Mississippi River Commission at Wilkerson's Landing, Bolivar County, Miss., connections were made with the secondary bench-marks of the Commission, and tho river was crossed into Arkansas, two metho<ls being used, one that of simultaneous and reciprocal observations, carried on by Mr. McGrath and by Mr. John Nelson, Aid in his party, and the other by means of water-gauges, which were carefully observed antl then connected with the bench· marks of the line of precise leveling. The work was then carried westward. At various times during the season, in accordance with instructions, Dr. Branner was furnished with the heights and descriptions of such bench-marks us would be of use to him in connection with the topographical and geological survey of the State under his direction, and at the close of the season complete lists of bench-marks established by the party, with their heights and descriptions, were communicated to bim. On February 11, the work having been completed, field operations were closed. The method pursued throughout was that of running two single lines of precise leveling in opposite directions by different observers, Mr. McGrath taking the line in one direction and Mr. Nelson in the other.

Of Mr. Nelson's services Mr. McGrath speaks in terms of high praise, both as regards the accuracy and the rapidity of his work. Mr. F. A. Young, Recorder, was zealous and faithful. The observations have been discussed in the Office, and their results presented in Appendix No. 12, to this volume. Other duty assigned to Mr. McGrath is referred to under headings in Sections II and XV. Triangulation, topography, and hydrograph'!J of the Atchafalaya Rfrer, and detached surveys on the coast of Loui.~iana.-In December, 1887, Assistant C. H. Sinclair, having received instructions to make certain surveys needed on the coast of Louisiana west of the Passes of the Missiissippi, proceeded to New Orleans, and having had the steamer Hitchcock repaired and made ready for sea, left in her for Morgan City by wa~' of the Mississippi River and the Gulf. .An azimuth being required on Last Island, to give direction to the triangulation in that locality, Mr. Sinclair stopped there and occupied Raccoon station on the west end.of the island, placing an azimuth uiark about a mile to the eastward, and referring it to Ship Shoal Light-House. He was detained here a week by cloudy weather. Leaving Last Island January 28, 1888, the steamer arrived at Morgan City on the 30th, having stopped at Shell Islaml on the way to establish there, by the kind permission of the owner, a depot for supplies of coal, lumber, etc. It had been intended at the outset to execute a survey of verification at Southwest Pass, Vermilion Bay, hut as from circumstances oyer which they had no control, the officers assigned to Mr. Sinclair's party were unable to join him till much later in the season, ho took up at once the reconnaissance and triangulation of the .Atchafalaya River and its connection with the triangulation on the Gulf coast. .As a base of operations the line Deer Island-Belle Isle was used; the reconnaissance and erection of signals was .Pushed rapidly, and the principal part of the triangulation was completed by the middle of March. On account of the tall marsh canes fringing the river, it was necessary to put up observing tripo<ls·for even short lines. 'Vhen the last quadrilateral was reached, it be~ came necessary to open lines across marsh that could not be passed over in a direct line, as it was covered not only with tall cane, but crossed by ridges of willows from thirty to fifty feet high that could only be. reached by entering at certain places and getting on line by trial, the marsh being _too soft to allow a line to be followed up from one end to the other on range. Nortli of the most advanced signals the cypress woods are very lofty, and it was not deemed advisable to push the triaugulatiou through them by cutting. Points enough had been deter· mined by March 9 t.o start the topography, and work on the lower sheet was taken up by l\Ir. J. A. Flemer7 Aid in the party. Subassistant E. L. Taney arrived March 24, and having organized a separate party, executed the topography on the upper sheet as far as Morgan City. Meantime Mr. Sinclair went to the coast stations to measure the angles at Belle Isle, Point au Fer, and Deer Island; to examine the ground for a check base, and t(} have observations made for latitude and azimuth. Latitude was determined at Station Deer Island by Subassistant r. A. Welker on five nights with meridian telescope No. 6, and au azimuth measured by Mr. Sinclair, using theodolite No. 82. Upon the completion of the topography of the lower river, the hydrography was begun .April 3. Mr. Flemer assisted with the hydrography till .April 1.57 when he was recalled to Washington for other duty. On that date Mr.- Taney disbanded his own party and joined tho steamer, and after finishing the topography to Morgan City, aided in the hydrography till its completion. During the hydrogra.phic work, tidal observations were made at Shell Island, and the tide·guage established there was referred to suitable marks. Field operations were closed April 27, and the steamer was laid up at Bayou Bamf alongside the property of the Morgan Steam-ship Company, Mr. Natali, agent of the line, having kindly granted permission to this effect.

Other services performed by Mr. Sinclair are referred to under headings in sections X, XI, and XVI, and also under "Special operations." Topographic surveys on the coast of Louisiana between Vermilion Bay and Calcasieu Pass.-Topographic survey of the Atchafalaya River, Louisiana.-A topographical survey of the chain of islands known as the Cheniers, between Vermilion Bay and Calcasieu Pass, coast of Louisiana, was executed by Subassistant E. L. Taney in the winter of 1887-'88 under instructions dated December ~188~ From Cameron, Louisiana, where the work'was begun, it extended a distance of forty miles to the end of a ridge on the coast beyond the crossing of the Mermentau River. This ridge finally develops into a great number of small islands in the marsh, separated by deep "coups." This string of islands and coups was surveyed by chain and compass. Returning to Grand Chenier, M:r. Taney hired a sloop and proceedecl to complete the survey of Mermentau River from his point of crossing towards its mouth, to join Assistant Hodgkins' work of 1884. Hog Bayou and Bayou I1a Bovi were also surveyed, the work being done b;r the aid of an azimuth compass, and the points checked as often as possible by bearings taken to stations of the triangulation. After the completion of the topographical survey of this part of the coast, March 18, Mr. Taney joined the steamer Hitclicoek, reporting to Assistant Sinclair for duty March 22. He was then detailed with a separate party to make a plane-table survey of the Atchafalaya River, and completed the upper sheet of this work, to the railroad bridge at Morgan City, April 15, the lower sheet having been finished by l\Ir. Flemer. He then aided in the hydrographic survey of the river until April 27, when field operations were closed for the season. The statistics reported are : Topography for the Chenier Islands: Area surveyed, in square statute miles ................................... 117 Length of general coast-line (fast land) in statute miles.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · 122 Length of shore-line of rivers in statute miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16 Length of shore-line of ponds in statute miles ..........·............ _.. . . 30 Length of shore-line of bayous in statute miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .·. . . 25 Topography for the Atchafalaya River: Area surveyed, in square statute miles............ . .. · · . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . 24 Length of shore-line of river in statute miles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24 Reference is made under a heading in Section I tooth er duty assigned to Mr. 'l'aney. Hydrographic surveys on the coast of Louisiana betzceen Isle Derniere and Big Constance Bayou, including Vermilif>n Bay.-The hydrographic surveys executed by Lieut. F. II. Crosby, CJ. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Gedney, between February 1 and May 24, 1888, included the hydrography of Vermilion Bay, Louisiana, aud the continuation of the off-shore hydrography of Louisiana to the ten-fathom curve from Isle Derniere to longitude 91° 40' west. For the survey of Vermilion Bay, the scheme laid out comprised four hydrographic sheets, each on a scale of 1-200001 and for the outside work two hydrographic sheets, each on a scale of
1-80000.

With these sheets, which have been completed and sent to the Office, Lieutenant Crosby has submitted descriptive reports. The coast in the localities of bis survey is very low, with occasionally a clump oflive oak trees, and at rare intervals a building. At Chiniere le Ligne there is a small fishing settlement. During summer the prevailing winds are southeast, the heaviest gales coming from that direction, except the hurricanes, which come from the southwest, and only in September and October. In winter the heaviest gales or" northers" come from the northwest. Wrecks are almost unknown. The currents set to the west-

ward as a rule, but they arc niry sensiti\-c to the action of the wind. '"~ith the exception of Trinity Shoal, wliich is gra,Y sand, aud the numerous shell reefS nearer shore, the bottom is very soft mud. In the channel through Southwest Pass into Yennilion Bay, Lieutenant Crosby states that the greatest depth of water is about one hundred awl tlfty feet, and the least slwen and a half feet on tl1e ontside !Jar. The clrnm1els are pri1ctically permanent. The bay iR used chiefly in the transportation of lumber and c:1ttle; the former uy light-draught schooners and tbe latter by steamers. Tliere arc extensive salt mines on Aver.r's Island, about six miles up Petit Anse Ha~·ou, from the bay, but the salt is shipped by rail to New Iberia. At the eastem point of the eutrauce to the Pass are the ruins of an old light-house lying in the water and showing wl1ite at a distance of three or four miles. Lieutenant Crosby obserYes that a light-house or a tower at this point would greatly ai1l strangers in finding the entrance to the l'm;is. Tlw oflicerR attached to the party were Ensigns B. 0.

Re.~urre.IJ.~ and examinations in San Diego Bay and 1.'foinity.-'l.'ertiary triangulation a.nd topography between San J)ie[t<> and San Pedro Bays.-neference was made in the last annual report to the progress of the trigonometrical determinations, shore-line surveys, and examination of clrnnges in San Diego Bay and vicinity by Assistant Aug. F. Rodgers, aided by Subassistant Isaac Winston. '.rl1is work was com1>leted at the end of July, 1887; its results were shown by tracings of three topographic sheets, containing nearly fifty miles of shore-line, and by an abstract of eighty new geographic positions. 'l'owards the end of August the tracings and computations having been finislled, they were forwarded to 'Vashington. Mr. Hodgers refers in his report to some statistics which show the extremely rapid development within a few _years past of the cit~- of San Diego, one item of which may be here mentionedthe custom-house receipts, which in 1885 were $8,000, and iu 1887, $257,000. Bct,ween the encl of August and the close of field operations in December, Messrs. :Rodgers and Winston were occupied in a reconnaissance for stations of a tertiary triangulation to conne~t the San Diego Bay sune.)'S with those brought south ward from San Pedro; with the observations of horizontal angles until a junction of the two surveys had been effected, and with a topograpltic survey laid out upon firn plane-table sheets, scale 1-10000, including the shore-line and all of the salient topographic features in sight from the coast, among these being the town si~ and all buildings in Oceanside, Carh1bad, Leucadia, Encinitas, Del Mar, and La Jolla. Great ca.re was taken to leave nothing undetermined within the limits of these sheets which could be of importance to the mariner or available for future hydrographic work. The plane-table work was greatlystrengthenetl and facilitated in execution by the numerous secondary objects which had been fixed in posi· tiou; these consisted of some thirty-eight buildings, church-spires, school-housM, hotels, and other notable structures. In the conrse of a comparison which he made of part of the shore-line of False Bay, including the sand-spit which forms its western boundary, Mr. Rodgers found no evidence of marked change

since the date of the first surv(ly nearly forty years before. In addition to the five topographical sheets already alluded to, a sixth, or supplementary sheet., was projected to complete the deliuea· tion of the connections of railroad and wagon-roads extemlillg north from San Diego Bay and ronml the limits of False Bay; on this sheet was laid down also the position of the new wharf built at Roseville upon the shore of San Diego Bay. Upon the close of field operations, December 17, Mr. Rodgers disbandpd his party and proceedtid to San Francisco. From the date of his arrinil, December 25, he was continuously occupied until towards the tni{ldle of April in reYisiug field computations, inking and tracing })lane-table sheets, and in preparing the results of his work for transmission to the Office. Two of the original sheets of San Diego Ba,v were inked and traced, the tracings being filed in the Sub-office, and the originals tor warded to Washington. A tr;1ciug of the third San Diego sheet was forwarded, and the original retiiiued for possible fntnre use in determining changed locations of bar and whistling-buoys at the entrance to the bay. Tracings of the five original sheets of survey of the coast-line for a distance of forty-five miles north of San Diego Bay were made and forwarded, together with a tracing of the supplementary sheet, and all the records and results of the triangulation. · On February 23 Subassistant Winston was detached and ordered to other duty. His services Mr. Rodgers refers to as having contributed greatly to the success of the season's work. In April, instructions haYing been received to resume field operations in southern California, Mr. Rodgers left San Francisco on the 27th of' that month, and early in May began the erection of signals for the interior topography north and south from Oceanside., San Diego County. On June 12 the progress of this topography was temporarily suspended by instructions directing him to go to San Juan Capistrano, and lay down upon the topograpLic sheet of that locality the new line of the California Central Railroad. This was accomplished hy the 20th instant, when the Oceausi{le work was resumed. Subassistant John E. McGrath reported for duty ,Tuue 21. Ai the close of the fiscal year twenty square miles of interior topography north and south of Oceanside had been completed, and the work was in active progress.

Specia.l h.ydrographic examinations at San Juan Capistrano, La Ballona, and at Newport and San Pedro Ba.ys, Oalifornia.-In accordance with instructions, and nuder the direction of Assistant George Davidson, Mr. Ferdinand ·west<faltl made a minute examination of the approaches and a-n· chorage of San Juan Capistrano for the map already made. This was <lone in much detail, and the soundings were reduced for the tide by comparisons with a tide-staff set up at Newport Land· ing, where regular observations were continued. The weather at San Juan was ad\·erse; fogs and strong winds prevailed, and the landing tltrong-h the snrf was dangerous. Tlie boat was capsized twice. This work was all reduced, plotted, tracings mad<·, anll tbe sheets and records transmitted to the Office . .At La Ballona tlle projected piers were determined in position by connecting them with the regular triangulation and topography. As the proposed dredging ltad not been executed, there was no need of a detailed exaruinatio11 . .At San Pedro Ba,'5·, the Crnpo sunken rock, having seventeen feet of water upon it, was carefully examinetl and two heads were discovered. Further examination was made to determine. whether there was any line of submerged rocks hence to Deadman's Islaud, and also further out in the anchorage. No other clang-er was detected. . Mr. Davidson bad reported that four different vessels had been upon this rock before it was hnoyed. 'J'he rock was connected by observation with the regular work of the Survey and the location of the buoys fixed. The city plans of r,011g Beach and Alamitos were reduced. At Newport Bay, under J\Ir. Davi1lson's direction, Mr. Westdahl made a special examination of the ph,'5-sical h,'5·drograpliy off the beach to the west of Newport Bay entrance, where one of the great submarine valleys heads. This work was at once reduced, and the records and sheets sent to the Office. Other llydrographic work executed by Mr. ·westdahl, under the direction of Mr. Davidson, is referred to in a later beading of this section. ., Exmnination of the site sclecfe(l for the meas1trement of a p1·imary base-line near Los Angeles, California.-.An account was given in the Annual lte1wrt for 188G of an examination made in May of that year to obtain a site for a base-line to be used instead of the San Pedro base, one of the ter· minal markings of which bad disappeared . .A sit~ wa.s selected, hut no funds for the measurement being immediately available, it was post· poned. In June, 1888, it, became probable that the measurement might soon be made; instruc· tions were given, therefore, for a re-examination of the site with reference to its freedom from im; pediments. This examination was made on June 9 hy Subassistant Fremont l\lorse, under the direction of .Assistant George Davidson. Mr. Morse drove over the line from its northeastern to its southwestern end. Near Northwest Base he found the base site crossed by the new line of the Atchison, Topeka aud Santa Fe Railroad, which runs nearly parallel with that of the Southern Pacific, and crosses the base-line at about the same angle, about halfway between Northwest Base and the Southern Pacific crossing. But as there is no fill at the point of crossing there is no obstruction to measurement of the base. Neither do the few wire fences that have been put up south of the Southern Pacific crossing and between it and the first ranch house offer any obstruction. An early measurement is, however, as Mr. Morse reports, exceedingly desirable on aecount of the great rapidity with which the country in the vicinity is being settled. An instance of this is the growth of the town of Whittier, three or four miles north of .Anaheim. When the base was located in 1886 no suclt town was in existence; it has now some 2,500 inhabitants. Another thriving town, still nearer the line of the base than Whittier, is Fullerton, built up entirely since 1886. Towards Southeast Base the soi.I, which for some distance from Northwest Base is alkaline, grows better and more adapted for agricultural purposes. The land which is not inclose<l and cultivated bears a heavy crop of natural grasses and wild mnstard. mustard staljrs are from eight w ten feet high, giving ample evidence of the fertility of the soil. Magnetic recordc0titinued atth,e aelfregistering magnetic station at Los .Angeles, Oalif-ornia.-.Ab· solute measttres of the magnetic e'lements made monthly.-Assistant R. E. Halter bas submitted a report of his work at the magnetic observatory, Los .Angeles, California, for the fiscal year. .At this station a continuous record of the variations of the magnetic elements is kept up by means of the Adie magnetographs, and absolute measures are made on three days of each month.

Near the beginning of the year seme changes were found necessary in handling the sensitive paper and in other parts of the routine work; these were made with satisfactory results. A new azimuth mark bad to be established, a house having lteen erected iu line between t11e observatory and the mark first employed. In January, 188ti, the lower observatory used for absolute measures was nearly washed away by heavy rains; this made it necessary to raise the building and the pier, which was done in time for the F<~bruary determinations. The usual semi-annual observations for scale values were made on December 29 and June 26. On January 6 Mr. Halter found it necessary to re-balance the vertical-force maguet, the magnet spot being nearly off the cylinder. The scale value was again determined immediately afterwards. During the month of October the clock was stopped by a mole or gopher, and seven hours' record was lost, and 011 t:he 17th of May tile vertical force lamp was extinguished by a uird or a bat, a11d one hour's record was lost. Ou June 12 the winding cord caught in the pemlulum of the clock, and seven hours' record wa.s lost. Hence the total loss of recoril during the year was fourteen hours of the unifilar, fourtee11 hours of the bifilar, and fifteen hours of the vertical force. The development of the traces throughout the year was remarkably good. Absolute measures of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were made regularly on the 14th, 15th, and 16th of each month without interruption. Observations for time were made on the 1st of each month, or as soon after as possible. The records, computations, and duplicates were kept up t;o date, and forwarded eYery month to the Office. In the routine work and with the records Mr. Halter was assistell b;y Mr. W. r. Miles.

Tertiary tria1igulati<>n and topography on the soitth coa,st of OaUfornia.-An abstract was given in the last annual report of the work of the party in charge of .Assistant Stel1man Forney on the south coast of California in advancing the topographical surve_y on that coast towards San Simeon Ba~·. A junction ha Ying been effected with .Assistant Rockwell's survey at San Simeon about the beginning of the fiscal year, Mr. Forney moved his party and camp to San Carpoforo Creek, tbe western terminus of Mr. Rockwell's work, and took up a tertiary-triangulation which be carded westward. t-0 Cape Sau Martin, connecting it also with the primary triangulation stations Rocky Butte, Cone Peak, and Santa Lucia. At the two stations last named he erected large signals. By December 22 he had completed the topography of the coast to tbe limits of the first plaueta.ble sheet as far west as Buckeye Caiion.

During the remainder of the winter and until the end of A1iril, 1888, Mr. Forney was engaged in completing his records and in tracing aml inking his topographical sheets. Having receiveu instructions to resume field-work, he left Sa.n Francisco l\fay 1 and proceeded to Cambria, San Luis Obispo County, where he organized his party and took up tile extension of the coast triangn lation northwestward from the line China Gulcl1-Yellow Ilill to the line San Martin Top-Alder Top, and the topograpl1y from the mouth of the San Oarpoforo Creek northwestward to Villa Canon. The wor-k involved the erection of large signals at twel\e stations of the triangulation close to the coast, and at two stations, Rocky Butte an<l Sa11ta J,ucia, of the main triaugnlation. In putting up these signals much time aud hard labor wai\ spent, tJie country being rough and transportation difficult. In compliance with iustructions the contour curYes for the toyography were carried to tl1e summits of' the coast range, which niried iu distance from the ocean between one and a half and four miles. Ou June 17 and 20 1\Ir. Forney determined the positions of two sunken rocks in Twin Peak
Bay.

The topographical sheet upon which lie was occupied at the close of the fiscal year included the ricll gold mines discovered a year ago, yieldiug three tons of ore per day, each ton producing gold t-0 the \'alue of $600. Otber mines have bee11 opened in the vicinity, hut luwe not as yet proved productive. This mining region is on Alder and "rillow creeks, antl extenlls from the ocean to the summit of the coast range. In Villa Cafion there is a fiue grove of silYer fir trees, coveriug about fifty acres of ground, and containing about two thousand trees. Some of these are two hundred fod in height and four feet in diameter at the base. i?urtlter report of the progress of Mr. :Forne.'·'s work will be made in the next annual ,-olume . .M1 John Nelson re1Hlered efficient S('rvfoc as aid in tbe party.

The station selected for occupation was Macho, one of the stations connecting the coast series with the transcontinental triangulation, and necessarily one in the main series that will be developed eventually over the great valley of California. The mountain is in the eastern flank of the Mount Diablo range, and overlooks the San Joaquin Valley. It lies thirty miles southeast of the town of Livermore, and is reached by wagon and by pack-animals over a rough road. · On the 22d of July, 1887, a lower camp was established in the l\laeho Canon; a temporary stable for the pack-animals made, a trail up the mountain laid out, and as rapidly as possible the party and instruments were brought up to the station, which has an elevation of nearly 4,000 feet above the sea. The piers for the theodolite and meridian instrument were made of concrete, and both were set up within the observatory, a wooden building with canvas roof. As the arrangements for observing approached completion Mr. Walker was sent to post beliotropers. At each of the stations Round Top and Conness, on account of their great height and difficulty ot access, it was deemed advisable to have two heliotro1rnrs stationed. Unfortunately, the first set of heliotropers deserted their posts a few days after being stationed, and a second set had to be sent. Assistant L. A. Sengteller performed this duty. At the stations Toro, Sierra Morena, Diablo, and Tamalpais, Mr. Charles B. Hill, who was familiar with the locality, posted the heliotropers. For the observations at l\Iacbo the statistics reported are as follows : Horizontal directions.-These measures were made with the _twenty-inch theodolite No. 115, using it in twenty-three positions; they were begun August 19 and finished October 30. Twek~ bundrell and forty.five observations were made on ele·en objects, in connection with sixty-one hundred and .fifty-six readings of the ocular micrometer, the value of which was determined. The objects observed were eight heliotropes at stations of the triangulation, one direction mark, and the two domes of the Lick Observatory, on Mount Hamilton. Eight secondary readings (singJe pointings) were made ou peaks in tbe Hamilton Hauge, to the north and south of the Lick Observatory. Vertical angles.-These were obsen·ed on twenty-one days on sixteen objects by eleven hundred and eighty observations. Seven of the o~jeets were heliotropes; the instrument used was the Gambey vertical circle No. 137. Time.-The errors and rates of the chronometer, John Hutton, No. 207, which was used in all of the astronomical work at the station, were determined by observations on eight stars on twenty-three riights. Latitude.-For determinations, both of time and latitude, meridian instrument No. 16 was used. For latitude, observations were made on twenty-seven pairs of stars on seven nights. Three hundred aud eighteen observations upon a Ursre Minoris were taken on six nigh~s for value of micromet.er. .Azimuth.-Observations fur azimuth were made with the theodolite in the same twenty-three positions as for horizontal direction, a Ursm Minoris being taken in twenty-two positions aml o Ursre Minoris in six positions on twenty-two nights. In each position, ten pointings (five direct and five reversed) were made upon the mark and twelve upon the star, five hundred and thirty observations being taken. Magnetic observations.-Determinations of the magnetic declination and horizontal intensity were made, for the former on four days and for the latter on three. After closing field-work at Macho, the standard magnetic station near the Presidio, San Francisco, was occupied. Observations for the declination and horizontal intensity were made on five days and for dip on two days. The line from Macho to Mount Toro passed so close to the crest of the Hamilton Ridge, about two miles south aml east of the Lick Observatory, that the heliotrope at Toro, when no refraction existed, showed through small oak trees and busbeB. It was necessary, therefore, to remove the trees and open an avenue. At times very large r~frttction was noted on this line, the heliotrope at Toro appearing twice the height of the ta.IleAt trees above the ground. An~Jntensely smoky condition of the atmosphere prevailed in a.11 directions, dne ro fires

ranging over many square mileR, not only in forests, but through agricultural districts, and causing great destruction. The Rmoke from tllese fires was at times so dense that only the faintest outline of ridges barely half a mile distant could be seen, and it rose to an elevation far above the line of sight to the Sierras. After completing tlie field-work on October 30 the party was disbanded, and Mr. Lawson proceeded to San Francisco, where he completed his records and computations and placed them in the hands of Assistant Da>idsou for transmittal to \Yasl1ington. In this duty he had the, aid of Mr. Morse. On November 7 Mr. Welker was detached and instructed to report for duty to Assistant Sengteller. Mr. Lawson expresses himself as indebted for >ery effective assistance to Messrs. Welker and Morse in all of the operations of the seaso11. Observations for the latitude of tlte Lafayette Park Station, San Francisco, in connection with the main triangulation.-The astronomical and telegraphic longitude station at Lafayette Park, San Francisco, was occu1lied for the obt;ervation of its latitude, in connection with the main triangulation. It was important, m01'eover, to know wl1ether there existed at this station a different station error from that found at the Presidio astronomical station and Telegra1>h Hill latitude station, the Lafayette Park observatory lrnviug been adoptetl as Hie primary telegraphic longitude station for the Pacific coast. It is also the vrimary 11Cndulum station for that. coast. It bad been intended by Mr. Da>idson to occupy the station for this work in October, and be 11repare<1 n large list-Of stars for it, but otber pressiug duties preve11ted bis beginning the observations till .January, 1888, wben he took it up with the aid of Assistant Lawson, and at times with . that of Subassistant Morse. The instrument used was the old zenith telescope No. 1. For time, observations were made with tmusit instrnmeut No. 3. Tue value of the zenith telescope micrometer ,was determined on 1lve nigl1ts hy eight sets of observations 011 Polaris at western elongation and on B. A. 0. 4165 at eastern elongation. Each serieli extended through thirty-three Lalf-turus of the micrometer screw, aucl olJscrrntious were made at the quarter-turns to determine the mechanical defects of the sllouldrr and collar of the screw-hearing. Collimator observations for value of the level scale in terms of the micrometer were made on three days.

Ocetlpation of tlw station Pre.vidio of San Francisco for rnaqne!ic obseriw.tions.-Mention has already been made of tl1e magnetic determinations at the primary triangulation station Macho and subsequently at the station Presidio of San I<'rancisco. At this last-named station, where Assistant Davidson hegan the Pacific coast series of magnetic observations in 1852, be had observations made by Subassistant Morse on five days in November, 1887, for declination and horizontal inteni;ity, and ou two days for dip. And again, by the same officer, in May, 1888, the declination, horizontal intensity, and dip were observed on four days, the object being to maintain a close watch for the epoch of maximum eastern Yariation. The observations, whicL are very consistent, indicate tltat the epoch is very near at hand. In th_is connection. Mr. J?a':idso~ refers to l1is official com1.nunication of his discovery of a.Jvaluahle series of magnetw vanat1ons 111 au old volume of Spamsh explorations, in which were con· tairn~l observations by the sl1ip Duchess of Pontchartrain, in 1714, at nine locations between Gnada· lupe Island and Cape Corrient.es. He has caUed attention also to the valuable series of magnetic observations girnn in Dudley's "..Arcano deJ Mare," 1647, embracing the ..Atlantic coast, Gulf of

Later, he found in the original charts of Dudley magnetic observations

by Drake (1579) and by other authorities, and communicated them to the Superintendent.

Under the heading" Sub-office at San Francisco" a summary is given of the duties involved in t!N cbaPge of that suli-office, which has been, as heretofore, with Mr. Davidson. Tidal record cont-i1med at tke automatic tidal station at Saucelito, San Francisco Bay, California.Assistant Davidson bas continued in charge of the Saucelito automatic tidal station, and has attemled to all the tabulations and sl1eets, examining the latter throughout before transmitting them to the Office. The bench-mark reference to the zero of the staff has been re-examined by Mr. Westdahl, who makes monthly visits of inspection. Since Mr. Charles B. Hill resigned to accept a position at the Lick Observatory, Mr. Davidson bas made the observations at the Lafayette Park station for error of the tidal chronometer. By authority of the Superintendent he furnished to Ool. George H. Mendell, U. S. Engineers, the half-hourly readings of the tide-gauge for two and a half months for the reduction of his soundings in the bay of San Francisco. Mr. Emmet Gray remains as the observer at Saucelito. The record which he keeps up is of standard excellence. Exchanges of telegra]Jhic signals for lo1igitude beticeen San Francisco, California, mul Portland, Oregon.-Reference was made in the last annual report to the occupation of the Lafayette Park Station, San Francisco, by the longitude 11arties, and the progress of the telegraphic exchanges for longitude between San Francisco and Salt Lake and San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, was stated up to the close of the fiscal year. On July 1, 1887, Assistant 0. H. Sinclair, being in charge of operations at San Francisco, and Assistant Edwin Smith at Portland, three nights of exchanges of longitude signals had been obtained. Two more were required, and these were obtained July 5 and July 8, after which the observers exchanged statiorn;, and with Mr. Smith at San Francisco and Mr. Sinclair at Portland, the determination was completed by the exchange of longitude signals on the nights of July 18, Augustl2, 16, 18, and 19. The unusual length of time occupied in getting these five nights was due to very unfattorable weather at San Francisco chiefly, but partly at Portland also, and to difficulty with the t-0legraph lines. During July Mr. Sinclair determined the latitude of his station on six nights, making one hundred and thirteen observations on twenty-three pairs of stars. 'l'he value of the micrometer of zenith telescope No. 2 was found by observations of e and o Ursro Minoris at upper eulmimition. It had been planned to take up the determination of a number of stations to the north of Portland, but this being deemed inadvisable on account of the lateness of the season, it was decided to take up the lines Portland-Walla Walla, Washington Territory, and ·walla Walla-Salt Lake City. A. report of the progress of these longitude exchanges will be found under hea{lings in Sections XI and XVI. Determinations of gravity at San Francisco and at Mount Hamilton, Oalifornia.-In the annual report for the preceding fiscal year an account was given of the progress of the observations for latitude and determinations of gravity made by· Subassistant E. D. Preston on the Hawaiian Islands, at the request of the Hawaiian Government and by special assignment with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. ,. Under the beading ''Special operations," towards the close of this volume, the fu.rther progress of that work is reported up to date of its completion, August 30, 1887, when Mr. Preston's connection with the Hawaiian Government ceased, and he sailed for San Francisco. Having arrived at that port September 6, Mr. Preston resumed his service with the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and on the next day began preparations for the comparative determinations of gravity needed to supplement those made on the Hawaiian Islands. The first station occupied was in the pendulum-house in Lafayette Park. Some few days' delay was caused by the necessity of passing the instruments through the custom.house and of refitting the pendulum sta:i:td, which had become warped from disuse. Obserrntions were begun September 12. Mr. Preston acknowledges the effieient aid received from Mr. C. B. Hill, who was assigned to him for this duty through the kindness of Assistant Davidson. Mr. Hill bad experience in the work, having taken part in the pendulum ex{Mlriments of 1883, and with his help the swinging went

on uninterruptedly night and day from the beginning to the eml of the series, each observer taking eight hours' obseHations followed by eight hours' rest. At Lafayette Park the Ia.st swing was made September 21. After dismounting the instruments and forwimling them to Mount Hamilton, arrangements were completed with the Director and Trustees of the Iiick Obsen·atory for the occupation of a sta· tion there. -Before leaving San FmucJ.sco, barometer and thermometer comparisons were made, zero points determined, the records were duplicated, aml the chronograph sheets read. These duties, with soml~ miscellaneous office-work, occupied the time until October 9, on which day Mr. Preston left for San Jose, and the next <la~· reached the Lick Obser\·atory. Preparations for the pendulum swings were at once begun, and on the 13th instant the first observations were made. No assistance beiug available for continuous work day and night here as at San Francisco, the series proper, that is, twelve hours' observations per day, occupied Mr. Preston's time from 6 a. ru. to about 7 p. m. daily. From 8 p. rn. till miunight Mr. J. E. Keeler, assistant in the observatory, who had volunteered to aid in the work, with the approval of the Director, Prof. E. S. Holden, made one swing, and duriug this period ob.sened the usual stars for time. The clock corrections furnished by the obserrntor.r, it need hardly be said, left nothing to be desired. Obsen·ations were finished October 27, and, after dismounting the instruments and sending them to San .Francisco, tlley were forwarded Nonmber 1 to \\'ashington. On December 7, in accordance with instructions, Mr. Preston arrived in 'Vashington, and took up pendulum expel'i· ments at the gra\·ity station at the Smithsonian Institution. Heference to this work, in which be had the aid of Assistant J. B. Baylor, is made under a heading in Section III. Resurvey of Suis1tn Bay and tributaric.~, California.-In continuation of the resurvey of Suisun Bay aud its tributaries, which, as stated in the last annual report, had been brought t.o a close April 19, 1887, by the exhaustion of the appropriation, Assistant r~ouis A. Sengteller was direeted on September 12, 1887, to organize a party and report to Assistant George Davidson for detailed instructions. Pending the appro\'al of his estimates, be took the field as directed early in October, and having recovered aud relmilt the ueceissar.r i,;ignals for the triangulation, as also the topographical signals reqnisitc, he prosecuted the resurvey till February 2, 1888. At this date, owing to the heavy rains wl.iich had maue the roads practically impassable, it was deemed advisable to close field operations. The work bad included the shore-line of Suisun Bay from the mouth of Montezuma Creek to the head of the bay; thence, passiug the mouths of Grizzly Slough and Roaring River, to t,he passage bounded by Hyers and Simmons or Eads Islands, as also all the tributaries emptying into the bay or streams abow~ mentioned. It was further developed from ahoutone mile northwardly of Collinl'ldlle to the northwestward, so as to include Montezuma Creek arnl stream8 emptying therein from Grizzly !Rlaud and the main shore. The marsh ancl main shore-lines, and such detail beyond the latter as was found upon the old published chart or included within the area of projection furvalue to the nishe<l b;y the Office, were redetermined, or such portion thereof as was deemed resurvey. For the triaugulation which was needed to insure the topographical accuracy of so extended an area, the points selected were far as practicable such structures as house-chimneys, cupolas, or gables, rapid of determination and conspicuous by their height. After disbanding bis field party, Mr. Sengteller took up the inking and tracing of bis plane· table sheets, and was thus occupied until March 16, when he received telegraphic instructions from the Superintendent to resume field duty, as also detailed instructions from Assistant Davfdson. Ilaving then re-organized his party, he resumed plane-table work March 27. At the end of the fiscal year the resurvey of Sui&un Bay and its trilmtaries was still in progress, and it was ex· pected would be completed in a few weeks. Gl' to June 30 the work accomplished included the shore-line of the bay, beginning about two miles nortbwardly from Benicia, up to and passing the mouth of Suisun Creek to the mouth of Montezuma Creek, where connection was made with work already done. The shore-lines of Cordelia, Suisun, Montezuma., and Nour&6 Oree.ks or Sloughs were surveyed to their heads of navigation.

Mr. Sengteller observes that the immediate shores of the bay and streams over which his survey was carried are practically of one character, being in the main composed of a line of tule (or bulrush) generally well defined and gradually encroaching upon former water-ways, and in many instances quite rapidly. This be found to be particularly noticeable along the shores forming the bead of Suisun Bay, including the embouc}lureB of Suisun, Montezuma, and Grizzly Sloughs, and Roaring River. Grizzly Slough, which was formerly, and within twenty years, frequented by lightdraught steamers, and bad a width of from one hundred to one hundred and fifty meters, is now in many p1aces fordable, while at its mouth the tule has advanced one mile into the bay. Sub-assistant P.A. Welker joined the party November 9, and served with great acceptance till January JO, when he was ordered to other duty. Mr. C. M. Allen reported for duty as temporary recorder March 23, and was still in service at the close of the fiscal year. Resurvey of Eel Ri1:er entrance and of Salt River, California.-EeI River, which is the natural out.let to the southern part of Humboldt County, California, was surveyed in 1869-'70, by Assistant A. F. Rodgers, but owing to the great changes that had taken place at the mouth of tlle river since that date, and the rapid development of the trade and commerce of southern Humboldt, a resurvey was demanded which should include the river from its entrance to a poiut about a mile and three-quarters above, and the whole of Salt River to Port Kenyon, the present shipping point for this region. Instructions for this work having been issued to Assistant George Davidson in February, 1888, he directed Mr. Ferdinand W estdahl to make a preliminary examination of the locality and report upon the extent of the survey that would be desirable. Early in March, the plans for tlle work having been decided upon, Mr. Westdahl proceeded to the mouth of Eel River and began a search for the triangulation points of 18.-0. Although most of them had been llestroyed, enough were found to determine additional ones and carry the work forward. The banks of Salt River had been 11urveyed in 1869 only as far as its junction with Centreville Slough, but as Port Kenyon lies nearly two miles higher up, the topography was carried up to and beyond Port Kenyou. A portion of the north and south points of Eel River entrance was also resurveyed. After the topography was finished soundings were obtained ou the bar and in the entrance, and the two rh·ers were sounded out to the limits of the topographical survey. The soundings were referred to a plane of reference derived from the mean of the lower low waters of twenty· seven days' observations at a tide-gauge established at the Shingle Mill Wharf, near the mouth of Salt River. The results of the survey, both topographic and hydrographic, are shown on one projection, scale 1-20000, which has been deposited in the archives. With it Mr. Westdahl has submitted a full descriptive report of the work, which occupied him from March 12 to April 3. Referring to the peculiarities of the streams aud sloughs surveyed, he observes that Eel River is a very long stream, and in period of freshets carries a. large body of water to the sea. Its delta extends from Table Bluff on the north to the hills back of Centreville on the south, a distance of eight miles, and rea.ches inland to the first great bend, some nine or ten miles to the ocean. In times

past, the river has formed this low land and its old channels still remain as sloughs. Some of these have entirely dried up, but can be readily traced in driving across the country. The principal slough to the southward of the river is called Salt River. It is connected with Eel River, about nine miles from the st>a, only in periods of freshets, when the waters of the latter river run into it by several small channels too 8hallow to admit the immense drift logs and snags which abound in Eel River. Salt Ri\·er is, therefore, comparatively deep and free from snags and offers better facilities for shipping than the main river. Landings l1ave been attempted on Eel River, but the steamers lose their propellers by coming in contact with sunken snags. During the last thirty.fiYe years the location of the entrance to Eel River bas varied from a little south of its present position to about two miles to the northward. The tendency of the river during freshets or after the first rains of the fall is to break straight out opposite its mouth; as the river current becomes less voluminous, the south point keeps advancing to the northward and forcing the north point in the same direction, but with a continually narrowing opening between them. This advance t-0 the northward, Mr. Westdabl obserYcs, is 110 doubt caused in part by the general movement of the sand to the northward by the inshore eddy current, but it is also materially assisted by the shape of the junction of Salt River with Eel River. The former is at all tim(\S a tidal stream, almoi.;t equall;y active throughout the ;year, and its ebb current meets the Eel River current at right angles close under the south point of entrance, thereby tending to prolong the point. Mr. \Yestdahl's report presents many statements of local interest with regard to the great progress of the region during the last ten or fifteen years, with tables showing· ti.Jc present value of its prnducts, and suggestions for works of construction uear the entrance to Eel River, so planned as to accelerate and make more liermanent the present favoral>le action o~ the river itself. He acknowledges tbe very material assistance he received from the firm of Robarts Brothers, of Ferndale and Port Kenyon, in the way of personal services and supply of means of transportation. Upon returning to San Francisco, after having reduced and plotted his soundings and inked his sheets of survey, Mr. W estdahl resumed his regular duties in the Sub-office.

Completion of the topographical reconnaissance of the coast of Oregon front Yaquina Bay t11 Cape Orford, an<l thence to Cape Sebastian.-At the beginning of the fiscal _year .Assistant E. F. Dickins had bee11 in the field since tlkc cud of May, engaged in a topographical reconnaissance of the coast of Oregon between Cape 0.rford (formerly known as Cape Blanco) and the mouth of the Yaquimt l~iver. As stated in the last annual report, be had tinislrnd nearly one-lialf of this reconnaissance July I, 1887, having at that date reached Heceta Head, ou his way clown the coast from Yaquiua. Entrance. Inteuded to delineate the outline of the coast and its characteristic features, the plane-table sheets upon whieh tlkc results of the work were to be shown were laid out upon a scale of 1-40000. The reconuaissancc was pushed forward at every opportunity available, and by October 22 had been completed, covering five topographical sheets. These have siuce been forwarded to the Office, accompanied by a full descriptive report, in which J\fr. Dickins makes note of the peculiarities of each portion of his survey, naming the towns arnl settlenwuts, their means of commnni· catio11, tlie facilities for navigation and tbe dangers thereto, and stating the distincti,·c topographical features of the coast line. The Yalue of this report is much enhanced by eighteen views of capes, bead-lauds, and entrances included within the limits of survey. At Blacklock Poiut (formerly Rocky Point) a connection was made with the topography execuh'd by tl1e part.)· of .Assistant Chase in 1869. Mr. Dickins checked the direction of bi.s coast-line by obserYatious on the sun for azimuth, at suitable intervals; approximate (}etermina.· tious were made also of time and latitude.

During the winter Mr. Dickins was occupied in bringing up the results of his field-work, and towards the end of March, 1888, was instructed to make a topographical reconnaissance from the limits of the topography at Cape Orford towards Cape Sebastian. Having re-organized his party at as early a date as was desirable for the work contt>mplated, he left San Francisco on May 12, and proceeded by way of Empire. City, Oregon, to Bandon, Koos County, on the Coquille River, where he procured saddle and pack horses, and pushed forward w Port Orford, arri\'ing there May 24. The reconnaissance was immediately begun, but during June was greatly retarded by bad weather, sixteen rainy days occurring during that month. Tbe party succeeded, however, in making fair progress over a very rough and rugged coast, and by June 30 bad reached the mouth of the Rogue River.

From this point the work made good progress during the remainder of the season, and was finished August 8 on Tillamook Beach. The general direction of the coast shown upon the topographical sheet is straight, and about west-northwest magnetic. Its topographical features are very broken and complex. The highest summits of the Coast Range of mountains are not shown upon the sheet, as they are from twelve to twenty miles back from the ocean shores. The most prominent topographical and geological feat· ures are the great transverse spur ending in Cascade Head; the high basaltic mm;s, terminating in the long trap dike of Cape Lookout, and the isolated mass of hills ending in Cape Meares. Mr. Rockwell has submitted full descriptive reports of the localities of bis work, accompanied by a note-book of sketches of prominent capes, headlands. and groups of rocks witliin the limits of his survey. These records, with the original topographical sheets, have been deposited in tlie archives. While prosecuting his reconnaissance he made examinations at Cape Lookout and at Cape Meares with reference to sites for a light-house proposed to be built at one or other of these points, and bas submitted a special report, with views and sketches, in which he state1:1 in detail the various considerations bearing upon the construction, facility of access, and arc of visibilit:r of the proposed light-house, and indicates Cape Lookout as a more desirable and useful llOint for the purpose than Cape Meares. During the winter, and until April 25, he was engaged on office duty, and on that date was instructed to report to Assistant Davidson at the Sub office in San Francisco, for dut,y iu connection with the preparation for publication of the fourth edition of the Pacific Coast Pilot.

Ou four days in this month Mr. Smitl.1 made observations to determine the magnetic declination, dip, and horizontal and total force at ·walla "\Valla. The longitude determiuation, Walla "Walla-Salt Lake City, was taken up towards the end of Septemller, Mr. Sinclair occupying tlrn i;tatio11 at Walla "Walla, aud Mr. Smith the station in Temple Block, Salt Lnke City. In this position of tl1e observers, lougitadc signals were exchanged on the nights of September 28, October 1, 4, 8, 11, and 12. At Walla ·wana the latitude of the station was determiued by Mr. Sicclair with trausit No. 6, l>y obsening twe11ty })airs of stars on fiye nights.

Notice of additional stations occupied by the longitude parties will have place in tbe next annual report. Topographical resiwve:y of the water-front at A8toria, Oregon, and recovery and remarking of tidal benck-marks ....:....Marked changes having taken place in the water front of Astoria, Or{'gon, since tile survey of 1868, Assistant J. F. Pratt was directed to take up a topographical resurvey of the wharf: lines, and in connection therewith to recover and remark the ol<l tidal bench-marks. Upon reaching Astoria, August 21, 1887, )fr. Pratt began a search for the four triangulation stations given on a tracing of the original survey. But one of these, "Shortis House," could be eertainly identified. "Astor Point" was, howe,-er, lornted sufficiently near for the purposes of the survey, and the work was oriented by these two stations. All traces of "Astoria fiag-11taff" had disappeared, and but a portion of the signal of" Upper Astoria" was found, the bluff:' upou which it was located having fallen away consideral:lly. About one-fourth of the city proper, including one-balf of tbe business portion, is built on piles, stancling over the water at high tide. Of the tl1irt~' most prominent wharves, twenty-four have been constructed for the use of the salmon canneries-the principal industry of Astoria. Mr. Pratt calls the attention to the need of a general system governing the constrnction of wharves projecting into navigable waters, one that would IJe applicable to many localities in Oregon and Washington Territory. He observes that the channel of the Columbia IUver, on the Astoria side, is quite nanow, and has always been dose to the shore along the water-front of tbe business portion of the city; it is now shoaliug in front of' wha.rves numbered 19, 20, and 21, and this, .Mr. Pratt thinks, is due to ihe construction of the long, projecting wharYes between those numbered 1and19. While the topographical work was in progress, locations for the new bench-marks were selected, and all three of the old bencl1-marks wero found. The four new bench-marks were established in localities but little likely to be disturbed, one of them (No. 4, 1887) being a copper bolt let into a basaltic bowlder buried below the surface of the ground, and another {No. 5, 1887) a copper bolt let into one of the foundation-stones of the Clatsop County jail. Descriptions of Nos. 4 and 5 were furnished to the Clatsop County court., and spread upon its minutes. All of the bench-ma1ks were referred by careful leveling to the Coast and Geodetic Survey plane of referenee, which had been determined in former years by the series of observations at the self-registering tide-gauge at Astoria. The former tidal observer, Mr. Louis Wilson, has in operation in the warehouse of his firm two tide-gauges, one ot bis own construction, for indicating the roughness of the Columhia River Bar, and the other, of the Coast Sur·vey pattern, which he attends to for the Engineer officer in charge of the improvements at the mouth of the Columbia.

Hydrographw 8urvey of Bhoalwater Bay and ita approachBll, an,d off-shore hydroyraphy between tltat bay and Gray's Harbor.-At the beginning of the fiscal year t11e party of Lieut. J. C. Burnett, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer McArtltur, bad been engaged in makingbydrograpbic sur>eys on the Oregon coast since early in May. On July 11, 1887, the inside bydrography of Shoalwater Bay was finished, aud the hydrograpby of the approaches

to the bay, on July 28. Lieutenant Burnett then took the steamer to Astoria for coal and stores, aud on Augw-it 11 began the outside hydrography between Shoalwater Bay and Gmy's Harbor. Forest fires were raging in the vicinity, and the atmosphere was so thick that but little progress could be made. During August but eight days' work could be done, and in September the weather was sti11 more uufavorable. Heavy gales, fog, and rain prevailed and kept the vessel at anchor for nearly three weeks. There being no indication of a cl1ange of weather, and it being the opinion of pilots and otbt>rs acqnaiuted with tlrn coast that nothing more could be accomplished during the season, Lieuteuaut Burnett decided to suspend further operations, and on the 10th of October returned to San Francisco. He had succee1led, however, in developing tbe twenty.fathom curve from the northward of Shoalwater Bay to within two miles of Gray's Ilarbor. He is convinced that for work off this coast the best months arc May, June, and July, with possibly a portion of August. At the heginniug of the season tb.e officers attaclied to the AfrA rtlmr were Ensigns W. P. White, .J. A. Bt>ll, and .T. L. Purcell, U. S. N.; R. I. Reid, assistant engineer, and R. "\V. Auza1, assistant snrgeou, U.S. N. Ensign N. S. 1\fosel~", CT. S. N., joined the party May 21, and Eusign J. H. OJiYer, U. S. N., July 21. Ensign W. P. White, U. S. N., was detached Jnl,y 24, aud Ensign J. I.... J>urce11, U. S. N., two days later. Ensigu G. R. Slocum joined the party .August 7, and August 9 Ensign ,J.P. McGuinness, U.S. N. On the 18th of September a sad accident occurred. the upsetting of a whale-boat, by which Ensign Mosely lost his life.

He states that no directions can be gfren for entering the bay, and vessels should never attempt it without a pilot. The clianges are so suddt>n and frequent that the pilots will not take a vessel in or out without first sounding across tlie bar; this they do e\·eu if the;r had been over it but the day before. Upon Lieutenant Burnett's arrival off the entrance~ and while waiting for high water, he made frequent casts of tbe lead off-shore, hut could find no indications of a change in depths as given on the last published chart. Continuation of the triangulation and topography of Sat·atog{i Passage, and the coast and harbors in the vfoinity.-Immediately after closing operations at Astoria, Oregon, reference to which has been 1rn1de under a preceding heading in this section, Assistant J. F. Pratt proceeded under instructions to Seattle, "\Vasbington Territory, on his way to resume the triangulation and topography of Saratoga Passage and the waters in the vicinity. Some progress in this survey l1ad been made by Mr. Pratt during the summer and autumn of 1886, as is stated in the last annual report. More rapid means of transportation for the party, while ou the working-ground, being needed than were available last season, Mr. Pratt bas been authorized to tum the whale· boat belonging to the schooner ICukon into a steam-launch. Funds for this purpose being limited in amount, Mr. Pratt had himself made all the working plans and bad personally superintended and directed all the details of arrangement and placing tbe machinery in positio11. Aftt>r trial trips, during whieb the launch repeatedly made a run of sixteen miles in two hours, using as fuel drift-wood picked up on the beach, the rukon was gotten under way in tow of the launch October 18, and reached the working.ground at Holmes Harbor, Washington Territory, October 24-, 1887. The triangulation and topography of the harbor were begun without delay, and prosecuted to their completion November 8. The work was then taken up in Saratoga Passage. On November 10, during the paAsage of the schooner to a more favorable anchorage, an un· fortunate accident occurred. The steam-launch was capsized in Saratoga Passage and sunk in thirty.five fathoms water, and the fireman drowned. On account of the long distances that a great part of the work was from the most available ancborageti, it was not now feasible to execute the topography with no other means of transporta-

tion than a row- boat; hence after tho loss of the launch nothing but triangulation was attempted; this was carried on till November 29 7 when the advance of the season indicated tl1at it would be advisable to close field operations. Accordipgly the Yukon was taken to Eagle Harbor, Puget Sound, where she was laid up, and on December 6 the party was disbanded.

Hydrographic surveys of Saratoga Passage, Holmes Harbor, and of the

northi~est

coast of Whid-

bey Island.-In accordance with instructions issued at the eud of February, 1888, the schooner

Earnest and steam-launch Tarry-not were prepared for hydrographic work under the direction of Lieut. H. T. Mayo, U.S. N., Assistant Ooast awl Geodetic Survey, autl left Olympia April 10. On the lltb they arrived at Seattle, and on the ~lst anchored in Holmes Harbor, Washington Territory. A tide-gauge was set up and observations lwgun the same day. During the progress of the hydrography, comparisons were kept up for two days of the tidlll levels at Holmes Harbor with those at 1.'ulalip on Possession Sound. On May 31 the hydrography on the sheet of Saratoga Passage and Holmes Harbor having been completed, that of the northwest coast of Whidbey Island was taken up. Allan Island was. reached June 5. The weather during the month of June was most unseasonable, and this in connection with the distance of the anchorage (necessarily four miles) from the northern limit of the work, and the difficulty of :finding the old triangulation marks, led to mueh delay, so that up. to June 30 but four days of sounding work could be done. For the season of 1888 up to the close of the fiscal year the statistics are: Ily<lrography: Area sounded, in square geographical miles... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60 Number of miles (geographical) run while sounding...... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 320 N nm ber of angles measured .. _.................................... _. . 1, 963 Number of soundings __ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ............ _. . . . . . . . . . 6, 265
Ensign A. C. Almy, U.S. N., was attached to the party. l\Ir. W. B. Edwards served as pay yeoman. Further reference to the progress of Lieutenant l\fayo's survey will be made in the next annual report. Hydrograpkic wrveys in Rosario Strait and Padilla Ba.y, Washington Territory.-The schooner. Earnest, having been prepared for hydrographic work, umler tlie direction of her commander, Lieut. C. T. Forse, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Surwy, left Olympia April 14, 1887,in tow of the steam-launch Tarry-not. His instructions were to execute hJdrographic surveys in .Rosario Strait and Padilla Bay and neighboring waters. On the 21st of April Burrows Bay was reached and the Earnest anchored inside Allan Island, and th:s anchorage upon investigation proved to be the best that could be found without going too far away from the field of work. Much bad weather was experienced till near the eud of May. Even on days on which the wind was light, a heavy swell woultl be found in Rosario Straits, rendering it unsafe to attempt crossing with the steam-launch. A tide staff was set up and tidal observations were began April 25. Soundings were begun May 13. Daring the entire season great allowance had to be made for the tide currents. Advantage was taken of the neap-tides to execute the deep-water work, and even then it not nnfrequently happened that but parts of days could be utilized. On Jnne 27 the schooner's anchorage was shifted_ to Eagle Harbor near north end of Cypress Island. A tide staff was set .up and tidal observations be~un the same day, an observer having

been left at the Allan Island gauge to keep up obserrntions there so -that a comparison of gauges might be obtained. The sheet, which included thP- hydrography of Hosario Straits and Bellingham Channel, from Deception Pass Entrance to a parallel passing through Viti Rocks (omitting that portion of the straits west of Cypress Island), was finished Jul~· 30. There being a lack of siguals west of Cypress Islaud, it was deemed advisable not to spend the time then in such triangulation as would be necessary, but to take it up later in the season. On July 30 the Earnest proceeded to an anchorage on the east side of Guemes Island, near the south eud, this being a central position for work on the Padilla Bay sheet. A tide staff was set Ull and observations beguu. Smoke iuterfored greatly witll the work during August and September, and there were occasional smoky days after the middle of October. On October 28 the hydrography on tho sheet embracing Padilla, Fidalgo, and Samish Bays was completed, and further operations were suspended for the season, part of the crew being discharged on the arrival of the sclwoner at Seattle October 30. The reduction of the crew was completed November 5 at Olympia, and the Earnest laid up in winter quarters in Butler's Cove. Duriug the winter the party was engaged iu office-work, before Lbe completion of which Lieutenant Forse was detached from the Surve,y, and the records were finished by his executive officer, Lieut.

Continuation of the triangulation and topography of Bellingham and Samish Bays and the islands in their vicinity.-At the beginning of the fiscal year Assistant J. J. Gilbert was actively engaged in prosecuting the triangulation and topography of Samish and Bellingham Bays, having been in the field since the middle of April, 1887. Reference to his progress from that date till July 1 was · made in the last annual report. In the first part of the season be bad as a means of transportation the steam-launch Fuca, but by au accident to the heater of her boiler, July 12, he had to rely after that date on small boats, using sails whenever the winds were fa\·orable. About the middle of July the usual smoky weather began, and continued with varying density until late iu September, when heavy rains put out most of the forest fires. Fortunately the triangulation had beeu nearly completed before the smoke set in. Starting from th~ base Sinclair East-Lum mi Rocks, the triangulation was extended into Samish and Bellingham Bayt:i and through Hale's Passage. The topography executed during the season is shown on six plane-table sheets, and includes the shore-line of Guemes Island from station Boat Harbor to station Eden, and the following islam1t:i complete: Sarnish, Jack, Ven do vi, Eliza, Point Francis, and Clmckanut; the we.st shore of Lummi Island as far north as Village Point station, and the east shore as far north as station Lummi northeast; also the main-land from a point near station Vi' are House on the Samish Flats. around the bays of Samish, Chuckanut, and Bellingham, and along Hale's Passage to its north entrance, together with about twelve miles of the Nooksacht River. Mr. Gilbert has transmitted the records and computations of his triangulation to the archives. He bas forwarded also his topographical sheets, accompanying each sheet with a full descriptive report and about twenty india-ink sketches of the localities under 1mrvey. Tracings of the shore-line of two sheets and part of a thir<l, with geographical positions, were furnished to the bydrographic party of Lieutenant Forse during the season.

During the winter Mr. Gilbert was occupied' chiefly witli office work, and before taking the field in the spring had forwarded to the office the originals and tracings of l1is topographic sheets and the records and computations of his triangulation. He had oversight also of the repairs made to the steamer Fuca. The completion of these repairs was retarded uy tlle difficulty of obt;iiuiug materials and -workmen. They were, however, finished toward the e11d of April, and on the 27th of that month he left Olympia for Tacoma to examine the triangulation of Commencement Bay and rectify an unexplained discrepancy. Having found that this discrepancy was not in the observations, Mr. Gilbert proceeded to Seattle, and thence to Fairhaven. Ou the morning of ]\fay 4 he reached the north end of Lummi Island, where be proceeded to establish camp, preparatory to the work of connecting the triangulations of Bellin!!ham Bay and Rosario Strait, arnl extending the triaugnlation to the Gulf of Georgia. After some time spent in searching for stations of the triangulation of 1853-'5-i, siguals were erected 'on Lummi, Ureas, Clark, Barnes, Martin, liucia, aud Patos Islands, and along the main-land as far as Point Whitehorn, on the Gulf of Georgia. Up to June 30 the triangulation had been completed as far as Patos Island, and the work was in active progress. The topography was but just begun; some had been done 011 Lummi Island and up the Lummi River, and some on Sandy Point. Further reference to this survey will be made in the next annual report.

ALASKA, INCLUDING THE COAST, INLETS, BOUNDS, BAYS, RIVERS, AND THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS.
(SKx-rcrr No. 13.)

Hydrographio surveys in Frederick Sound and vicinity, southeastern Alaska.-Under instructions dated in March, 1887, Lieutenant-Commander Charles M. Thom;us, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Patterson, left Sau Francisco May 4, for Alaska. The Patterson had in tow the new steam Ja11uch Cosmos, which ball been constructed at the Mare Island Navy-yard. In immediate command of the Cosmos was Ensign A. P. Niblack, assisted by Ensign A. M. Beecher, U.S. N., both attached to Lieutenant-Commander Thomas' party. Other officers under his command were Lieut. De 1Vitt Coffman, U.S. N.; Ensigns Albert N. Wood, John H. Shipley, Charles C. Marsh, Maurice L. Read, and John D. McDonald, U. S. N.; Tlwmas H. Streets, Passed Assistant Surgeon, U. S. N., and Hollaml N. Stephenson, Passed Assistant Engineer, U.S. N. Mr. John McHenry holding the rate of paymaster's yeoman, anll Mr. J.C. Stone holding the rate of master-at-arms, were employed as draughtsmen. Port Townsend, Washington Territory, was the first port to be made on the trip. The voyage proved to be a very tempestuous one. While passing through a severe gale on May 7, off Cape Greirory, the hawser used in towing the Oosmos snapped, aud the two vessels parted company, the Patterson reaching Port Townsend May 11, and the Oosmos on the night of May 12. Ensign Niblack has made a full report of the voyage of the Cosmos up to the date of her joining the Patterson. At the outset, when the hawser broke, one of the firemen was disabled, and while crossing the bar of the Columbia River, through three miles of breakers, a hea,~y sea.made a. clean breach through the deck-house, flooded the engine-room and galley, broke tbe water gauge, and stopped the engine. The machinist, Maurice Golden, though bruised and stunned, stuck to his post, and by his coolness and bravery, further damage to the launch was prevented, and she was enabled to st.earn under the loo of a pilot tug, and so was shielded from the terrible force of the seas. At Astoria, Lieutenant Burnett, U. S. N ., commanding the steamer McA rtltur, rendered e,very assistance; coal and water were obtained, and early in the morning of May 11 the Cosmos followed the McArthur across the bar. That evening, off Destruction Island, a fishing schooner was sighted, showing signals of distress, and upon standing down to her it was found that she hacl on board the ship-wrecked crew of the four-masted ship, Ocean King, bound from Nanaimo to San Pedro with a load of coal. Thia ship had foundered in the gale otf Oape Gregory on May 8. Th~ cap-

tain, two mates, and lier crew of twenty-two men were taken off b;y the Cosmos and landed at Port Townsend. Ensign Niblack, to whose exceHent seamanship and good judgment the launch owed lier safety, expresses his high appreciation of the services rendered bJ' Ensign Beecher in supporting his own efforts to bring the launch through. After the accident to the fireman, Mr. Beecher stood an engine-room watch, with one of the seamen as fireman, alternating with l\Ir. Golden. After taking on board signal lumber at Hadlock, Washington Territory, and coaling at Departure BaJ', the Patterson arrived at Port Simpsou, British Columbia, May 21. Here Ensign C. C. Marsh, U.S. N., the astronomer of the expedition, obtained obser>ations for time. lu order to expedite the prospectiYc season's work, Lieutenant-Commander Thomas fitted out the Cosmos with ten days' supplies and sent her with Ensign Niblack in charge, Ensign Beecher astlisting, to Fredeerick Sound, with instructions to reconnoiter for the site of a base-line, and select one near Dry Strait. On May 25 the Patterson was at Fort Wrangell, and Ensign Marsh was directed to occupy the astronomical station established at North Rase station by Lieutenant-Commander Snow iu 1886. On May 26 the steamer was anchored in Frederick Sound, near the north end of Wrangell Nar· rows, finding the Cosmos there. The site for a base that bad been selected did not meet all of t110 requirements for a good connection with the triangulation; accordingly, the steam-launclies, Cosmos, Vixen, and Pirate, with Lieutenant Coffman, Ensign Wood, and :Ensign Read, respectivelJ-, iu charge, were engaged on May 27, 28, and 29 in searching for a suitable site, and one was finally found by Ensign Wood on the eastern shore of the Sound, back of Point Agassiz, which, after personal inspection hy LieutcnautCommander Thomas, was adopted. The whole length of this base being over a level stretch of ground above high water, it was readily capable of accurate measurement. Of two measurements, made carefully with piano wire, the mean was taken, 4,609.35 meters, equal to 2.86 statute miles. On May 31 the steamer's anchorage was shifted to Brown Cove, in order to be near the astronomical slation which it was decjded to establish at South Base station. On June 1 a tide-gauge was put up near the anchorage, and tidal observations for a full lunar month were begun under the supervision of Lieut. De Witt Coffman, U. S. N. Other gauges subsequently put up at Portage Cove, Duncan Canal, Woods Bay, north end of Dry Strait, aud at Fort Wrangell were connected with this one by simultaneous observations, but slight differences of tidal level being shown. Upon the completion of his observations for time at station Wrangell, North Base (1886), Ensign Marsh began on June 4 the determination of the astronomical position of the Frederick Sound station, South Base, finding it to be by his field cornputatiMs in latitude 560 55' 44".7 N. aud in longitude 8h 51 m 24.5· west of Greenwich. Tl1e magnetic variation, as determined by compass magnetometer No. 15, was found to be 29° 40' 28" E. of N. A check-base, 250.28 meters in length, was measured June 4 on the Soukhoi Islands. On June 12, the Cosmos was despatched to Union Bay, Clarence Strait, to convey thither Ensign Marsh, with iustructions to occupy the astronomical station established there in 1885 by Lieut. Richardson Olover, U. S. N ., and thence to proceed to Port Simpson, British Columbia, to get additional observations for time. Delay occurred, owing to continued bad weather at Port Simpson, so that it was not till June 25 that time could be determined. Next day Ensign Marsh re-occupied the Union Bay station, and returned to Brown Cove on the 27th. Meantime, the triangulation was continued by Ensign Niblack, using the steam-launch Vixen, and Ensign Read, with Mr. John McHenry, in the Pirate, continued the running in of shore-line on the working ground. A plane-table sheet of Brown Cove was executed by Mr. Stone between June 7 and 11. Leaving a tidal observer in camp at Brown Cove, Lieutenant-Commander Thomas on June 20 shifted his anchorage to Portage Bay, Kupreanoff Island, where a tidal station established, a cheek base of six hundred and twenty meters in length measured ; a topographical survey made, and a magnetic station occupied, the variation being found to be aoo 29' 16" easterly. Ensign Marsh was sent to Cape Fa.nshaw, where he established an astronomical station, and determined

its geographical position in latitude 57° 11' 04".4 N., antl longitude 8h 54m 16.1· west of Greenwich. For the magnetic variation he obtained 30° 06' 31" E. of N. On July 13, the Cosmos was fitted out with supplies and signal lumber, an<l sent with whale boat in tow in charge of Ensign Wood, with Ensign Beecher as assistant, to conduct the sur,·ey of Duncan Canal, which opens into Sumner Strait between W oewodsld and Kupreanoff l:slands. A check base-line of 1,747.59 meters was measured and an astronomical station established at East Base station, observations at which showed its geographical position to be in latitude 56° 35' 47".8 N., and longitude Sh 52"' 25.3· west of Greenwich. The magnetic variation was 30° 03' 34".3 E. of N. Tidal observations were made for a length of time imfficient to connect with those at Portage Bay, the dilfe1·ence of readings proving to be very small. The soundings on the northern portion of the projection sheet in the vicinity of Cape Fanshaw were put in by a party on the Cosmos, between .August 7 and 2G, Ensign M. L. I~ead beiug in command and Ensign J, D. McDonald assisting. On the 8th of .August the Patterson shifted her anchorage from Portage Bay to Thomas Bay, in entering which great caution was observed, Lieuteuant·Commauder Thomas keeping two leads going on his own Yessel, and sending ahead the steam launches Vixen and Pirate to sound as rapidly as possible in advance. An anchorage of se,·enteen fathoms in the southern arm of the bay was obtained near a fine waterfall, a tide-gauge established near the sllip, and on .August 11 a check base of 1,357.9 meters in length was measured at the foot of Baird Glacier, in the northern arm of the bay. Determinations of geographical position at East Base gave for the latitude 57° 06' 38."3 N., and for the longitude Sh 51 m 12.2° west of Greenwich. The survey of Thomas Bay was fini11hed August 19. After receiving an additional supply of coal from the Pacific Mail Company's steamer Idaho, operations were continnml till the close of tlie season in October, by an independent sun·ey of Duncan Canal, by the completion of the work in Union Bay, connecting with the survey made tllere in 1886 by Lieutenant-Commander Snow, aml by the search for and location of a rock with a least depth upon it of nine feet in Nakat Inlet, off Tongass Island. The rock was 1-0cated October 8, and information in regard to its position was published in Notice to Mariners No. 92, bearing date of October 31. Of the work accomplished by Lieutenant-Commander Thomas and his party, the statement above made is simply an abstract, taken from the exceedingly interesting and Yaluable report submitted bs that officer, in which he give8 full descriptions of tl!e country included in the limits of his survey, its harbors and anchorages, and its striking natural features. Among these are the Great Baird and Patterson Glaciers, the Le Conte Glacier, and the Horn Cliffs. Upwards of one hundred photographic views illustrate tbe report; they were taken by Ensign Niblack aml Mr. McHenry. Mr. Niblack had been for three seasons the photographer iu the Patterson's party. .After concluding the sea.rch at Fort Tongass, the Cosmos, with Ensign Marsh, was sent to Port Simpson, British Columbia, where final observations for time were obtained by that officer on the night of October 8. October 13, after placing the Oosmos in winter quarters, the Patterson left Port Simpson for San Francisco, stopping at Departure Bay and Port Townsend, and arriving at San Francisco October 23, after a passage from Port Townsend of four da~·s and seven hours. The results of the season's work are shown upon the following hydrographic sheets: 1. Three sheets, Frederick Sound, S. E. Alaska, from Dry Strait to Cape Far:shaw. Scale, 1-80000. The first of these is the completed bydrographic sheet; the Recond shows the tri· angulation executed; the third shows the rough plotting of the soundings. 2. Duncan Canal Entrance.

Lieutenant-Commander Thomas expresses his thorough satisfaction with the manner in which all the members of his party performed the duties intrusted to them, referring particularly to the zeal, ability, and untiring industry shown by Ensigns vVoO!l and Beecher in making an indepemlent survey of Duncan Ca1ial, a work which they volunteered to do; also, to the work of Ensign Niblack, wLom he placed in charge of the main triangulation. He feels it incumbent upon him to call special attention to the astronomical work of Ensign Marsh, involving as it did frequent absences miles away from the ship, under circumstances of much personal hardship and many diffi. culties, wllich were speedily overcome by the ingenuity and skm of that able officer. All of the members of the party took part in sounding, but the greater part of the bydrographic work was doue by Ensigns Wood, Read, Beecher, and McDonald. The triangulation of Portage Bay, measurement of base, and plane table work was executed by l\Ir. J. 0. Stone, draughtsmau. Lieutenant-Commander Thomas deems the harbor sheet of that locality highly creditable to l\lr. Stone, it being the result of his own labor without assistance except the soundings. The shore-line on the projection sheet of' 1887, with the exception of Duncan Canal, Beecher Pass, and Cleveland Passage, was run in by Messrs. McHenry and Stone, tl1e former ni,;ing a sextant and establishing points between stations, then sketching in the shore between these 1>oints; the latter using a plane-table exclusively. Ensign McDonald delineated the shore-line of Cleveland Passage and Whitney Island. Full details are given in the report with regard to the courses of the tiood and ebb tides in Fred· erick Sound and the waters which connect with it, the set and velocity of' the currents, the rise and fall of the tides, and the comparative times of high water. Lieutenant-Commander Thomas observes that the time of high water, as also the rise and fall of' the ti(les, is practically the same O\'el' the entire body of water included in the limits of his survey. At Cape Fanshaw high water is about seven minutes later than at Fort Wrangell. About tl1e middle of March, 1888, in pursuance of general instructions previously issued by the Superintendent, detailed instructionl:l were forwarded to Lieutenant-Commander Thomas by the Uydrographic Ini;ipector relative to bis work in Alaska for the coming season. Ile was directed to take up the hydrography from the northern limits of the survey of 1887, extending it up to Stephens Passage, and over to the westward into Frederick Sound far enough to include Turnabout Island, and any other prominent features that would be of use to vessels standing up Stephens Passage. The Pattersoii left San Francisco April 7, 1888, and reached her working ground .April 27. The surveys begun by Lieutenant-Commander Thomas were in active progress when it became neces· sary to interrupt them, and instruct him to 11roceed to Portland Canal and Pearse's Channel, an<l take up a general survey iu those localities in order to com11ly with a request from the Department of State for surveys require<l to furmsh data for a determination of the boundary line between Alaska. and British Columbia.

Jn accordance with these instructions he left for Portland Canal towards the end of June, and arrived with bis party at Port Simpson, British Columbia, on July 2, 1888. Full statements, giving details of this work and of that previously executed in Alaska, are necessarily defe_rred till the next annual report. Contimtation of tidal record at the automatic tidal .~tation at St. Paul, Kadiak Island, Alaska.The series of tidal observations with an automatic tide-gauge at St. Paul, Kadiak Island, Alaska, has been kept up as heretofore under the general supervision of Assistant George Davidson. Mr. Fred. Sargent remains as observer. Mr. Davidson expresses his obligat.ions to the .Alaska Commercial Company for transmitting all official correspondence to and from this distant station with which there is no regular mail communication, and in winter no communication whate,·er. Lieutenant-Commander H. E. NichoJs, U.S. N., .Assistant Coast and Geodetic i5urvey, and Lieutenant-Commander Yv. H. Emory, U.S. N., commanding the steamer Thetis, and other officers have inspected the station, and have given the observer the local time to check his chronometer. All of the records show care and attention, and have been duly transmitted to the Office. Hydrographic explorntions in western Alaska.-In pursuance of the assignment of LieutenantCommandcr H. E. Nichols, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, to the duty of preparing a revised edition of the Coast Pilot of Alaska, and in order to obtain additional data for that work, he was instructed to proceed to western Alaska in .March, 1888, a''ailing himself of the Alaska Commercial Company's steamer, leaving San Francisco on the 10th or 20th of that mouth for Kadiak, and thence to Unalashka. Lieutenant-Commander Nichols was not provided with an equipment for surveying work, the oluect of his expedition being to make such notes and obserrntions as would enable him to add to, or correct approximately, the existing charts, prepare descriptions and sailing directions, and take views either by pencil or photograph. In the rapid movements that he was compelled to make, he found the pencil of more general use than the photograph on account of the prevalence of mist and fog. E\'en wl1en the obsen-er can sketch through fog, the photographic apparatus is often of no use. In accordance with instructions, lie left San Francisco in the steamer St. Paul of the Alaska Commercial Company, March 22, and arrived at St. Paul Harbor, Kadiak Island, 011 April 3. Ile was unable to visit any other part of the island, hut, makes note of au addition required by the chart of that barbor; it should show Cape Chiniak, the point always made in coming from the southward or eastward. He succeeded in getting a photograph of this point, and remarks that Tebenkofl's view is also very good. From shipmasters and others iu the employ of the company he obtained some information respecting Karluk Straits. From Kadiak he JJroceeded to Unalashka, which place he made bis headquarters during the summer, and from which he availed himself of every opportunity to Yisit the surrounding country, taking passage as occasion offerecl on the vessels of the Alaska Commercial Com1lany on their tri pi:; to the various trading stations. On Unalashka Island, he visited Makushin, Kashega, and Chemoffsky; also Unimak, on Unimak Island. These places are inhabited only by the native Aleuts, the compa:ny having a trading station at each place. Atkha, Kyska, and Attu, on islands of the same name, were succesi:;ively visited; also Akutan, on Akutan Island. Outside of Bering Seahevisite<lSanuakh Island, Belkoffsky, 1Vossenseusky,and Unga, some of them more than once, at the same time acquiring information regarding surrounding places as he passed in tbeir vicinity, and t.'lking views and sketches where practicable and useful. His examinations, which are detailed at length in his report, extended to the westernmost islands of the Aleutian chain, and included also the Pribilof! or Seal Islands, some localities in Bristol Bay, the Sbumagin Islands, and the east coast of the Alaska Peninsula. For the practical interests of the navigator, Lieutenant Commander Nicl10ls deems snffici~nt the knowledge of the tides acquired during several years' observations at the St. Paul station, and recommends that its remova-1 to a more important locality should be considered. · Among the localities specially demanding investigation and survey he mentions the whole of the east coast of the Peninsula of Ala.ska, the rivers emptying into Bristol Ba.y in Bering Sea, tte delta of the Yulron, the eastern half of Bering Sea south of Norton Sound, and the Passes leading to the Pacific Ocean.

In concluding his report, Lieutenant-Commander Nichols expresses his conviction that the present and increasing commercial interests of western Alaska warrant a request for the construction of vessels specially adapted for makiug surveys of its waters. To the Alaska Commercial Company and its employes he acknowledges his ohligatious for many courtesies, and the tender of every facility possible for carrying on his work.

Extensfon westu:ard of the tra,nscontinental triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel in Kentucky and Ohio.-At the begiuuing of the fiscal year, the party under the charge of Assistant A.

T. Mosman, engaged i:i continuing to the westward the transcontinental triangulation in Kentucky and Ohio, were occup_ying station Ash Ridge, Brown County, Ohio, and bad nearly finished work there. Mr. n. J. Meigs (No. 3)joiued the party as recorder June30, 1887. The building 1iarty under Foreman E. E. Torrey was erecting a fifty-foot signal at station Stevens, Kenton County, Kentucky, after completing which he joined the main party July 5. The necessary ohservations at Ash Ridge station were finished July 5, and tbe party was then transferred to station Minerrn, Mason Count,y, Kentucky, al.lout ten miles northwest of Maysville. The theodolite and obsen-ing tent lrnYiug been set up on the tripod, observations for horizontal directions were begun on the 10th of July and finished ou the 31st. During this period a temporary observatory was erected uear the station, and meridian telescope No. Twas mounted to be used for determining time, while zenith teloscope No. 6 was set up for latitude determinations. The observations for time and azimuth were assigned to Mr. W. B. Fairfield, Extra Observer, who had joined the party on July'.!!); those for latitude were made by Mr. Mosman. Cloudy nights and fog over the Ohio River delayed the work somewhat, but all of the observations were completed by August 30; after which, station Tate, Clermont County, Ohio, was occupied. The obser\Ting tripod at Tate was one hundred and twenty-nine feet high, and required considerable labor to prepare it for the work, wire guys having to I.le rigged, and tackle for setting and furling the canvas screens made and adjusted. Observations at Tate were hegnn Se1>tember 8. Very unfa\'Orable weather prevailed, and additional delay was caused by the prevalence of fresh winds lluring which the tremor comruuuicateu to the tripod maue it impossible to obtain satisfactory pointings. "'bile at Tate statiou, a signal one hundred and thirty-two foet iu height was built at station Tanner, Boone Oouuty, Kentucky, al.lout ten miles southwest of Covington, and the liue to it from Tate opened. After the completion of work at Tate Station, the party was <liYided. in order to facilitate progress. Messrs. l\losman and Torrey J>roceeded to Stevens station, about eleven miles south of Covington, Kentucky, while Messrs. Fairfielll and. Meigs occupied Flaugbn Station, about nine miles northeast of Falmouth, Pendleton County. Very smoky, dry weather delayed the work makiug it im11ossible for da.Ys at a time to see more than four or five miles. Station Stevens w~ fiuii:ihed November u, but Mr. Fairfield. was detained at station Flaughn till Decembers. After testing the intervisil.iility of the line Tanner to Dry Ridge, Mr. Mosman wa.s occupied till November 19 at Portsmouth, Ohio, in organizing a board for the examination and sale of certain camp equipage aud other property of the Survey which had been stored there.

Cpon the completion of his records and computations for the archives, Mr. Mosman was assigned to other Office duty, and on April 30, 1888, was relieved from the Office and instructed to take up a triangulation upon Long Island from Montauk Point westward. Geodetic operations.-Occupation of stat-ions for the connection of tlie triangulation of the State ·, of Tennessee with the primary triangulation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in northern Georgia and Alabama.-The connection of the triangulation of the State of Tennessee with the primary triangulation in northern Georgia and Alabama was advanced during the season of 1887 b_y Prof. A. B. Buchanan, Acting Assistant, who occupied four stations, Deadening, Owen, Roy, and Bean, of the scheme which he had laid out the previous season in pursuance of suggestions made by Assistant C. 0. Boutelle, in immediate charge of State surveys. The occupation of a fifth station, Harvey, was begun and about two-thirds completed. It bad been Professor Buchanan's intention to finish Harvey station and push on to High Point, in northern Alabama, but he was delayed at Bean station by bad weather about two weeks, and in July the signal at High Point was entirely destroyed by lightning. Bean station was finished August 29, and on the same day Professor Buchanan started for Harvey station. Hoping to get through with all the observations at that point by September 15, be stationed heliotropers at all the primary points, five in number, believing this to be a measure of economy. They were directed to begin showing September 3, and continue teu days. Delays in mail transmission and delays owing to smoky atmosphere combined to prevent the entire success which should have attended the constant watch kept up b~- Profossor Buchanan, who was at the theodolite from sunrise to sunset every day. Finding that there was uo prospect of finishing the station during the !mason, be decided to postpone further work at Harvey till the following spring, and left the field September 19. About the miudle of June, 1888, he resumed the work in accordance with instructions, and at the date at which this report closes was actively engaged in its prosecution.

.Extension to tlie westward of the transcontinental triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel in Ohio and Kentucky.-The advance to the westward made in the primary triangulation near tlie thirty-ninth parallel by the occupation of stations in Ohio and Kentucky was reported under a heading in the preceding section. As there stated, Assistant A. T. Mosman was in charge of the party, aided by ExtraObserYer W. B. Fairfield, R. J. Meigs, Recorder, and E. E. Torrey, Foreman. One of the highest observing tripods e,·er erected was occupied during the season, that at station Tate, Clermont County, Ohio, having an elevation of one hundred and twenty-nine feet. Field operations were closed early in December. Reconnaissance for tke connection of the triangulation of the State of Indiana tcith the transcontinental triangulation near the thirty-ni11th parallel, advancing to the eastward in Indiana, and t.o tlw westward in Kentucky.-The near approach of the two branches of the tranacontineutal triangn· lation,one advancing to the westward in Kentucky, the other to the eastward iu Indiana, made it desirable to have a reconnaissance executed which should establislt a satisfactory scheme for the connection of these two branches, and which should at the same time connect the trigonometrical survey of the State of Indiana with the transcontinental triangulation in that State. This duty was intrnsted to Assistant F. W. Perkins, under instructions issued in July, 1887. Mr. Walter B. Fairfield, Extra Observer, who was assigned to Mr. Perkins's party, took the field in advance of his chief, and had practically completed the first figure eastward from the line Rariden-Leonard in Indiana by the 23d of July. The final selection and verification of the points of this figure, and the eTOOtion of a tripod at Weed Patch station were completed by August 15. It was necessary to build this tripod before proceeding further on account of an obstructing ridge which lies about eight or nine miles to the eastward, and through which the gaps are few and very narrow.

80

The southeast point, .Miller, was unfortunately masked in like manner by a cluster of knobs lying about three miles to the northeast. These two ridges and the :Finley Knobs mark the eastern edge of the sandstone formation, and stand four or fiye humlrcd feet aboYe the plain to the eastward. This plair1, which embraces the whole drainage oftbe Vernon and Graham Forks of tlw l\1uscatatuck River, aml the greater 11ortio11 of the ·white or Driftwood Hirnr, coYern about fifty minutes of longitn<le, or the whole width of tlie Niagara limestone. It rises pretty regularly from five hundred feet above mean tide at the west to about one tlwusancl feet at its eastern edge, where the formation changes to the Cincinnati limestone, and the drainage tends westward to the Ohio Rfrer. Tl.Jc White and .Muscatatuck regions are said to be the wost heavily wooded in the State. The original growth mmit have been among the finest in thr Missi8Rippi Valley, since, after repeated cutting, many trees remain which range from oue hnndred and twenty to one hundred and thirty feet in hei~ht, and tbe aYerage is not leRs tbau one hundred. Upon the broad highlands the land is so flat tliat tlie water remains upon tbe surface during the greater portion of the year, excepting iu those places where some kiud of drainage bas been attempted, aud as thh; practically confines farming operations to the vicinity of the streams, it accounts for the plateaus being so heaYily wooded. In the eastern section: wl1ich is drained directly into the Ohio, a much larger proportion of the lantl is under cultivation, and the woodland is proportionate}~· small, while on the Kcntuck~· side of the river, as far east as the dividing ridge, upon which Tanner and Dry Ridge stations stand, the country 11as been almost denmled of trees. Owing to th<l collditions statf'd ahove, togf'ther with the fact that the streams have very shallow and narrow valleys, extremely Jligh signals are rendered necessary, and also, in some i111->tauces, the cutting of more or less trees. Immediately rastward from the line Weed Patch-Miller, and westward from Tanner-Dry I:i1lge, 1\Ir. Perkius adopted a series of ,-ery long four-sided figures, with central points, which join on a hexagon of good proporti011s. For this scheme, with the length of lines i11Yolve1l in it, the siguals will seem excessiYely high, hut the profile roughly suggested hy the description of the surfac(·, which is a ''err flat W. will show the necessity of hadng them so. The connection with tl1e State survey is by the line :Finley-Miller, which forms with NoonStout a wdl·shaped quadrilateral. The Reason was ouc of extreme drought in the region examined, resulting in very unfavorable at111os11lwrie cou<litiorn;, wl1ich with tlie long lines made the work of verification very tedious. An attt>mpt which was made to shorten the lines iu the western part of 1he work soon showed that the only result wouhl be to multi1)Jy the number of the signals without materially reducing their height. E.rtcnsion of the transcontinental triangulation near the tltirty·ninth parallel to the eastward in tl1e State (~f lndiana.-Iu tlw last annual report a statement wax gfren of the progress made up to June :m, 1887, hy tlle party in cllarge of Assistant George .A. Fairfield, engaged in occupying stations for extending to the eastwanl in Indiana the tranRe-0uti11ental triangulation near the thirt,,·-ninth parallel. .At Osborn station, l\lartin County, Indiana, the final ohscnations for azimuth needed to complete the work there were obtaiu~tl July 2. The next station occupied was lfariden, which is about thrt·e miles nortlnvi>st of l\litchell, J,awrenee County, Indiana. The reconnaissance for the selection of additional stations to the eastward heing still in progress, and the completion of the ni'xt figure Laving- not theu been reported, obsernLtious could be made on the back stations unly. Tue 11igl1t signal lamps having been previous!;\' established at these st.atious, observations on them 'wrn completed July 17, and while waiting for the reconnaissance and construction parties Mr. 1~airfieltl connected a section stone on the Second Principal Meridian with the triangulation, and determiuell the height of Rariden station above the bencb·mark in Mitchell, Indiana, which had been established by .Assistant ~raid in liis line of transcontinental leveling of 1m~cision . . ~be section stone was found with the aid of the county surveyor of Lawrence County, but ita pos1t10n was such that 1t could not be seen from any of the }lrimary stations; hence it bee&me

necessary to interpolate two stations, one of which was established on the school-house at Bedford, the county seat of Lawrence County. At the two secondary stations tho obserrntions were made by Mr. F. H. Parsons, Subassistant, who was attac~ed to Mr. Fairfield's party. He determined also the difference of ele"Vation between Rariden and the bench-mark at Mitchell by ruuniug lines of leveling forward and back, a distauce of three miles, with an ordinary engineer's Y lernl. The two determinations agreed very closely. On July 23 Mr. \V. B. FairfielU, who had been temporarily detached for reconnai3sance duty, rejoined the party, and reported that he Lad obtained for the next figure to the eastward a quadrilateral with a central point, and that be had selected the three stations Fountain, Miller, and Weed Patch. Mr. Torrey, Foreman in charge of the construction party, was at once directed to build a tripod and scaffold signal eighty feet high at Miller station, and another one hundred and six feet high at Fountain Station. Mr. W. B. Fairfield, having left full notes of bis reconnaissance, was relieved from further duty with the party and started on the 26th to joiu the party of Assistant Mossman, as bad been before arranged. On .August 15 the eighty.foot signal at Miller station was completed and the signal lamp was lighted. Next day the construction party moved to Fountain station and began the erection of the high signal there. Observations on Miller signal were finished August 25, and those on Fountain signal, begun on the 31st, were completed September 5. .At Weed Patch station a temporary structure sixtyfive feet high had been put up by .Assistant Perkins for reconnoitering purposes, and this was found sufficiently stable to be used as a station for a signal light. The erection of an observing tripod and signal at Weed Patch was deferred, therefore, to another season. From Miller and Weed Patch stations a magnesium light was shown during several days in .August by Mr. Parsons to Mr. Perkins' reconnaissance party . .After the completion of observations at Raridon station Beard was next occupied. It is about six miles southwest of Harrodslmrg, Monroe County, Indiana, a town on the Louisville, New .Albany, and Chicago Railroad. Between September 14 and October 1 all of the observations at Beard were finished. These included pointings on six regular signal lights besides those for connecting with the Second Principal Meridian. The party was at once transferred to Leonard station; everything wa~: made ready t-0 observe there by October 9, and on the 19th work at the station was finished without having missed a light in any of the seventeen positions, a feat which Mr. Fairfield observes he bad never been able t.o accomplish before. By October 29 all arrangements had been completed for beginning observations at Fountain station, and on November 13 they were finished, after which field operations were closed for the season and the party 1lisbanded. The weather was for the most part very unfavorable for the work. For several months no rain fell at all; consequently the air was filled with clouds of dust; this corubined with the coal smoke, which is always present in vast quantities in the atmosphere of Indiana and Illinois, and made it difficult to see the signal lights at night on long lines. Nearly all the wells in the country gave out, and many of the farmers had t-0 haul water for several miles for their stock. During July and .August the heat was intense, the mercury frequently rising as high as 1050 in the shade, and on one or two occasions marking 112° inside of Mr. Fairfield's tent. Later in the season t.he smoke from the numerous and extensive forest fires that were raging over all parts of Indiana and lllinois gave much annoyance. For a week at a time it would be so dense as t.o obscure even the faintest outlines of a large grove of trees, one hundred feet high and not more than a quarter of a mile off. The amount of work accomplished despite these unfavorable circumstances is exceedingly creditable to Mr. Fairfield and the members of his party. During the entire sea.son he used to illuminate the axis of the telescope a small Edison incandescent lamp of three-candle power, run by one of the small B batteries made by the Stout Meadowcroft Oompany, of-New York. This was found to give a very fair light for the purpose, being' H.Ex.22-6

steady, easil;y graduated to inh~nsity by the prismatic mirror, and of course without any flickering from the wind. Duriug part of the time he employed also, as reading lamps, small electric hand lamps, run by the same battery, but the light was so intense and made such sharp shadows tlrnt uuless it was always held in the same position with reference to the reading microscopes there was danger of getting a wrong reading. The use of these was abandoned, therefore, and that of the ordinary bull's-eye lanterns resumed.

Topographical surrey of the site of the American Bottom Base, Illirwis.-.A. remeasurement of the base-line in the Great American Bottom in St. CJair and Madison Counties, Illinois, having become desirable, Subassistant J. E. McGrath was directed to make a topographical survey of the site of the base, and a preliminary measurement of its length. He began field operations for this purpose l\farch 10, and completed them March 31, 1888. After erecting signals at both ends of the base, the line was cleared of brush and was then measured with a steel tape, stnbs being driven in every fifty feet, having copper nails in their tops to indicate each section of fift~- feet. Spirit-levels were then run over the line and cross-st>ctions made at all points where it was necessary to dernlop the contours. Data were thus obtained from which to make a profile of the base site and a topographical map. The country througl1 which the line runs is very low, flat, and difficult to drain. The original measurement was mad<> in 1872. Other duty executed by J\Ir. l\IcGrath is referred to in Sections II, VIII, and XV. Geodetic operations continued in the State of Wisconsin.-The party organized by Prof. John E. Davies, Acting Assistant, for the continuation of the triangulation of the State of Wisconsin, took t.hc field, under instructions, about the middle of May, 1887, and began observations at Lowell station near Reeseville, Dodge County. This station had been occupied in 1886 in order to make certain ex?tminations needed to perfect the reconnaissance for extending the triangulation to the eastward and southward. Upon the completion of the observations at Reeseville, Professor Davies transferred his party to station Fitzsimmons near the town of Bamboo, in Sauk County, and was occupied there till the advance of the seas01: compelled a cessation of field operations. .Fitzsimmons was occupied also as an astromomical station by Assistant 0. 0. Boutelle, as is stated under the next heading in this section. At Reeseville, Professor Davies measured thirty-one angles by three hundred and seventytwo repetitions. He put up new signals at the stations Elephant Bluff, Observatory Hm, Devil's Lake, and Gibraltar Bluff, and prepared the new tripod and observing scaffold at Fitzsimmons station. Observa.tfon11 for latitude and azi1nuth at a trigonometric station in Wisconsin.-Upon the conclusion of his duties in 1\linnesota, reference to which is made under a heading in Section XV, Assistant C. 0. BonteUe spent the month of September and a small portion of October in making a 1:<eries of observations for latitude and azimuth at the trigonometric station Fitzsimmons, near the town of Baraboo, Wisconsin. The small field observatory built at Minneapolis was taken apart and transported by rail and teams to Fitzsimmons, where it was again set up, and observations for latitude upon twenty"foor

pairs of stars were made with zenith telescope No. 5 between September 13 and 23. The azimuth of the line Fitzsimmons to Arlington was determined by observations upon Polaris with twenty-inch theodolite Coast and Geodetic Survey No. 113. Thirty series were observed in ten positions of the instrument. Fitzsimmons and Arlington are stations in the triangulation of Wisconsin which is in charge of Acting Assistant John E. Davies, of Washburn University, Madison. College duties prevented Professor Davies from making other than occasional visits to Fitzsimmons while these observatious were in pr;>gress, but all the resources of his party were cheerfully placed at Assistant Boutelle's disposal. Mr. George B. Brown, of Professor Davies' party, rendered constant and acceptable assistance both in observation and reduction <luring the entire duration of the work, while Professor Davies also took part personally on two nights. The observations were completed during the first week in October, and Assistant Boutelle then returned to duty at the Office in 'Washington. During the autumn and winter he revised and reduced the field observations in Minnesota and Wisconsin, turning into the Office twenty volumes of original and duplicate notes of observations and thirteen cahiers of reductions. He continued also the correspondence with acting assistants involved in the immediate direction of State surveys with which he had been charged by direction of the Superintendent in August, 1886. In June, 1888, he was instructed to take charge of the preparation and transportation to Cincinnati, and of the arrangement and exhibition there, of such instruments and apparatus of the survey as were available for the Exposition to be held in that city during the period from July 4 to October 27. Surveys and examinations at Burnt Island, .1l1ickigan.-Under the heading" Special operations,'' which follows Section XVI in this volume, full mention is made of the special surveys and examinations at Burnt Island, Michigan, undertaken at the request of the Department of State and with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. These examinations were committed to tl1e charge of Assistant C.H. Sinclair, under instructions, which took eftect May 14, 1888. He completed the field-work June 61 and bas since that date deposited in the archives the records and results of his surveys. SECTION XV.

Continuation of geodetic operations preliminary to a triangulation of the State of ]finnesota.Reference was made in the last Annual Report to the progress of geodetic operations in the State of Minnesota, in response to a request from the authorities of the State to have the benefit of the appropriation for furnishing points for State surveys. Also t-0 the appointment of Prof. W.R. Hoag, of the State University, as Acting Assistant, by the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the nomination of the Governor of Minnesota. Early in June, Assistant C. 0. Boutelle, under whose immediate supervision the State surveys had been placed, was instructed to take special charge of tht1 work in Minnesota at its beginning. He was directed to search for and locate a base-line for future measurement, and also to furnish data for certain local surveys asked for by Professor Winchell, State Geologist. Professor Hoag was assigned to duty as Mr. Boutelle's assistant. Field operations were begun in June, 1887, without delay, and continued throughout July and August. During this time a preliminary base was laid out and measured upon University avenue, in the northeastern part of Minneapolis, and a secondary triangulation was laid out and developed from it, which covered the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis. Ten stations were occupied, and the geographical positions of forty-eight points determined. A final primary base-line of a.bout :five and a half miles in length was decided upon. It falls upon a public avenue in a portion of the outskirts of the city of St. Paul, and is included in the limits of the secondary triangulation already exeent.ed. The consent of the authorities of the city of St. Paul to the temporary

use of the avenue for the measure of the base was obtained, and it will be measured as soon as an ap1)ropriation for the purpose becomes available. Tue latitude of a point near the State University in l\Iinneapolis was determined, and the position of the station referred to the dome of tllat building. Twenty-one pairs of stars were observed upon five nigl1ts witl! zenith telescope No. 5. Ob.senatious for azimuth of the preliminary base were made upon Polaris; thirty-three series being taken in eleven positions of twenty-inch theodolite No. 113. The longitude of the University had l>een determined by the Survey in 1873. Owiug to the extreme heat and drought that prevailed all summer, the reconnaissance could not be carried as far as was desirable, but the country was found to be favorable for triangulation at moderate cost with triangle sides of from fifteen to twenty miles in length. Further and more extended reconnaissance may show the practicability of longer lines. Mr. Boutelle, in his report of the seasou's work, acknowledges the zealous aud intelligent assistance given him hy Actiug .Assistant Hoag. Transcontinental line of geodetic leveling carried westu:ardfrom New Haven, .ilf.issouri.-Tbe exten sion westward of the line of trauscoutinental leveling from New Ha nm, Missouri, was committed to the chnrge of Subassistant J. E. McGrath by instruct.ions issued .April 2, 1888, with the understamling that .Assistant Gershom Bradford and Subassistant Isaac Winston should report to him for duty in the party at an early date, and that as soon as they became well practiced in the methods of work the charge of it should be transferred to Mr. Bradford. Fiehl operatious were begun April 17 by a careful determination of the instrumental constants of the geodeHic micrometer leYels Nos. 2 and 3. Two days later the line of lernls was begun at a bench mark placed at New Hann, Missouri, by Assistant Andrew Braid in 1882. Mr. McGrath remained witl1 the party until l\lay 3, but gave up the charge of it to Mr. Bradford May 1. Towards the end of l\Iay he inspected tlte field-work, and examined the records aud computations, and baYiug found the work progressing quite satisfactorily, he made a final transfer of it to l\lr. Bradford, aud made preparations to carrJ out instructions which assigned him to a term of sen-ice upon the .Pacific coast. Mr. Bradford, with the aid of Mr. Winston, continued the line of levels of precision to the end of the fiscal year. It had then reached a bench-mark between Osage City and .Moreau Creek, a length of fifty miles haYing been completed, one observer running the forward line and one the backward liue, except at the single river crossiug encountered on the route. Tlte work followed tlle liue of the Missouri Pacific Railway, and as permission to stop trains was refused by the railway authorities, the party was often compelled to walk long distances to and from the locality of work, and submit to many interruptions owing to the necessity of being at railway stations on time. During June the heat was exceedingly oppressive. Occ1tpatiun of station.~ for extending to the westward the transcontinenta.l triangulation near the thirt!f·ninth parallel in Kan.~as.-At the beginning of the fiscal year, Assistant F. D. Granger, liaYing finished a reconnaissance in which he bad selected nineteen new stations for carrying his triaugnlatiou to the westward, was engaged in the occupation of station Bebe Mound, Douglas County, Kansas, one of the points in the transcontinental triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel. On the 5th of July, 1887, having completed work at Bebe ~found, he transferred his party to Eckman iitation, Leavenworth County. Both of theRe stations had been occupied in 1885, but no points beyond tl!em to the westward had been :;elected. Tbc stations next in order were occupied as follows during tbe season: On July 26 tbe occupation of Kanwaka, near Le Compton, was begun, and observations were made upon fi\·e primary, two secondary, and ten tertiary objects, the station being finished August 16. Kanwaka is in Douglas County, about ten miles northwest of the city of Lawrence, its name being that of the township in which it is situated. The observing tripod at this station was about fifty-se\·en feet above the ground. On August 19 the party and instruments were transferred to station Simmons, which is sit· uated upon a promi11ent hill in Marion Township, Douglas County. The observing tripod here was at a height of forty-five feet. Mabon station, in Usage County, was next oecu11ied. It is about six miles southwest o(Oar-

bondale, and four miles northeast of Burlingame, towns on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. Tb.e instrument was elevated on an ollserving tripod fifty-three feet in height. Five primary and seven tertiary objects were obsen·ed. Bad weather was encountered at this station, so that the work was delayed in completion. After :finisliiug the observations at Mahon, October 17, the party proceeded to EleYatioll, a station in Shawnee Uounty about nine miles southwest of Topeka. This i·oint is well kuowu in Shawnee County. On its summit stands the Wesleyan Methodist Church aud on its south face the Elevation school-house. The obserYing tripod, which is forty-five fet>t high, stands immediately north of the church. During the occupation of this station the weather was eontinuom;l.Y favorable. Six primary and twenty-seven tertiary objects were observed, and work at the station was completed November 4. Among the tertiary points were tlrn State House of Kansas, the State Insane Asylum, and several church spires in Topeka. The last station occupied, PoweH, is about three miles south of the town of Do>er in Slrnwnee County. It is nearly in the center of the quadrilateral for.ne!l by lines from tbe st,ations Elevation, Mabon, Clark, and Adams. Four primary and fvurteen tertiar;y objects were here observed, the instrument being mouuted upon a tripod twenty feet aboYe ground. Field operations were closed at this station November 18, and after storing the instruments and camp equipage at Topeka and at Lawrence, Mr. Granger disbanded his party December 5. He commends lnghly the services rendered by his only assistant m the work, l\Ir. A. P. Barnard. During the winter, and until early in May, 18 88, Mr. Granger was occupied in Office duty. Having beeu relieved from the Office and instructed to resume field-work, he arrived at Lawrence, Kansas, May 15, and was joined on the following day by Subassistant F. H. Parsons aiHl Mr. 'l'. 0. Pulizzi, Recortler. Mr. A. P. Barnard, Foreman, having soon after reported for duty, the organization of the part~· was completed, and the erection of six obsen·ing tripod and scaffold signals was begun, these being needed in ad>ance of the occupation of the stations. While preparations were in progress for the occupation of station Adams, near Maple Hill, Wabaunsee County, Kansas, and about twenty-five miles west of Topeka, Mr. Granger put up a signal at the tertiary station Martin's Hill, near Topeka, and occupie1l tlrnt point to make measurements connecting the Kansas State House and other prominent objects in the city with the triangulation. Heavy rains delayed the transfer of the party equipment to Adams st.ation until June 2G, and continued unfavorable weather prevented obsen·ations before the close of the month, but the station was pnt iu readiness for geodetic and astronomical work.

Assistants Edwin Smith and C. II. Siuclair, who took up towards the end of September, 1887, the exchanges of telegraphic longitude signals between the stations in Temple Block, Salt Lake City, and the statkm iu the grounds of the Court-House at Walla Walla, completed their work October 22, having obtained exchanges of signals on six nights in each position of the observers. The preliminary computations show a satisfactory closing of the telegraphic circuit Salt Lake City-San Francisc0-Portland-"\Valla Walla-Salt Lake City. Occupation of stations for the extension castu:ard of the transcontinental triangulation near the thirty-ninth 1iarallel in Utah.-At the beginning of the fiscal ;year, the party of Assistant William Ei:11l1eck was establiished in camp upon the summit of Mount Nebo, in central Utah, and, as stated i11 the last Annual Report, liad made good progress with the observations for horizontal directions. .Mo1mt Nebo, which has an ele\·ation of twelve thousand feet above the sea-level, forms with Ibepab, Pilot Peak, and Ogden one of the great quadrilaterals by which the transcontinental triangulation iu Nevada and Utah near the thirt;p1inth parallel is advancing to the eastward. During July, 1887, the obserrntions at Mount Nebo were substantially completed; in addition to those for horizontal directions they included determinations of latitude, azimuth, and the mag· netic elements. On the 2d of August, camp at J\Iount Nebo was struck and arrangements were begun for the transportation of the party, camp equipment, and instruments by wagons to a camp at the base of l\fonut Guyot, a distance of (approximately) ninety miles. The greater part of the month was occupied in work preliminary to the occupation of the station. Tlie mountain approaches were ex11lored; aiJout ten miles of trail were located and in part opened from the lower camp to the summit, signals were erected, heliotropers (twelve in number) were posted, camp established near the summit of the mountain, and the piers and the platforms for tlie instrnmeuts were prepared. On the 31st, the first observations for horizontal angles were made. These, with obse1Tations for vertical angles, aml determinations of the magnetic elements, occupied the party during the month of September, aud until October 3. Camp was then struck, part of the force discharged, instruments no longer needed were sent to Salt Lake City for storagt>, nrnl arrangements wne made for the occupation of a station at Lakt~ Shore Bench near Grantsville, Utah, and for the e::.tablishment of a tide-gauge and bench· mark at IIooper, near the Rhore of Great Salt Lake. At Lake Shore Beud1 oli::>errntions of horizontal aud vertical angles and magnetic determinations were made. The corresponding "bench" near Hooper was referretl Ly spirit-leveling to the water lm·l\l of the lake. The astronomical statioU" in Temple Block, Salt Lake City, was coum·cted with the tria11gulatio11, and obser,·ations made near this station for the determination of the magnetic declination, dip, aud inteusit;v. These operationR, with those incidental to closing field-work for the season, occupied the time until the end of Nornmber, after which Mr. Eimbeck proceeded under instructions to Washington and reported for dnt,\· at the office. l\Ir. J. II. Tur1wr, Aid, rendered acceptable l!ervice during the greater part of the i;eason, haviug joined the party .June 8. During the winter, a111l until towards the eud of June, 1888, }fr. Eimbeck was occupied in completing the reeords and computations of bis field-work. As soon as funds were available be was iuistructed to resume field operations in central Utah.

SPECIAL OPERATIONS.

Determinations of gravity on the Hawaiian Islands, at San Francisco, on Mount Hamilton, and at Wasltington, District of Columbia.-The special assignment of Subassistant E. D. Pret1tou to duty on the Hawaiian Islands, made at the request of the .Hawaiian Government and approved by the Treasury Department, was still in effect at the beginning of the fiscal year. On July 1, 1887, Mr. Preston was making the ascent of Haleakala, a well-known volcanic mountain on the island of Maui. , Observations for gravity had been completed at tlie base statiou, Haiku, on the evening of June 29, and the ascent was begun the next day, the entire caravan numbering eighteen men and twenty-fiYe animals. After resting one night at Olinda, which is at an elevation of four thousand feet, and which lies at the lower limit of the cloud region, the party made an early start next morning, and after two miles of travel reached a point beyond which wagon transportation was impracticable. The larger instruments, the tents, and provisions ha Ying then been packed on muleback, and the chronometers, barometers, and thermometers taken by band, the ascent of the last five thousand feet was begun. This occupied five hours, and at three in the afternoon the party reached the edge of the crater. After a halt for an hour to allow the animals to recover somewhat from the effects of the rarity of the atmosphere and the travel over rough lava, the party advanced three miles farther to Comotierra, a point just below and to the south of the triangulation station Pakaoao, which has an elevation of about ten thousand feet above sea level. Here, within fifty feet of the perpendicular walls of the extiuct crater of Haleakala, which is half a mile deep and twenty miles in circumference, a pendulum house was prepared in an open space between two large rocks which afforded the requisite stability. This space was inclosed partly by stone walls and partly by blankets and tarpaulin!<, and a fairly constant temperature was thus maintained, notwithstanding the large range in the open air, ice being formed nearly every night. At Pakaoao full sets of determinations of gravity were obtained during eleven days with each of the two pendulums, the yanl pendulum, which was used in the determinations of 1883, and the meter pendulum. The swings were made day and night without interruption. Time and latitude were determined with a meridian telescope. For latitude twenty-five pairs of stars were observed. As the observations were made at a station several thousand feet above the usual limit of the cloud belt, the weather was generally favorable and the atmosphere extremely clear, many stars being observed before sundown with a telescope of two and a half inches a.perture and magnifying !lower of seventy. Prof. W. D. Alexander, Surveyor-General of the Hawaiian Islands, accompanied the expedi· tion to the summit, and remained a number of days. Mr. Preston acknowledges tbe aid derived from his experience and good judgment. Remarkable variations in the magnetic declination were noticed. All lava found on one of the peaks is highly magnetic, and changes of declination of several degrees m a distance of two miles were found to occur on the floor of the crater. After completing the observations at Pakaoao, Hana and Ka Lae o Ka Iho in the district of Kanpo were occupied as latitude stations between July 20and August 2. Both these are at the level of the sea. At the latter place as many as seventy-five pairs of stars were observed on a single night, an average of ten pairs per hour being taken. From August 7 to August 30, Mr. Preston was at Honolulu, engage1l m office work. On the latter date his connection with the Hawaiian Government ceased, and be sailed for Sau Francisco. Reference is made under headings in Sections X and III to comparative determinations of gravity made by him in California and at Washington, District ofCol11mbia. · During his sta.y in the Hawaiian Islands, from January 12 to Angust 30, 1887, he occupied fourteen latitude stations, three of which were gravity stations also. The latitude stations were generally chosen at places best adapted to brmg out the deflect.ions of the vertical, being estab· lished at points to the north and south of the high mountains. The pendulum was swung at a great elevation, at the sea level, and at a station occupied in 1883 by the United States Eclipse Expedition. This was done with a view of studying the downward attraction of th\' wountain, of throw-

ing light on its internal constitution, and for determining the ratio existing between its mean density and tbat of the earth. For latitude, the whole number of observations was nearly fifteen bnndred, being on the ayerage more than one hundred to each station. rrt>liminary reduction!" seem to in<licate a difference of nearly forty seconds of arc between the astronomical and geodetic latitudes iu Oahu~ and as much as fift_y-eight seco111ls at Ka,upo on Maui, while Pakaoao falls half-'lrny between Haiku and Kaupo. At Kohala on Hawaii there is a deflection of' half a minute toward the south, while at Hilo, sixty miles distant, the plumb line is deflected in the opposite direction nearly half the amount. On top of Haleakala the diminution of the force of gravity is not as great as was supposed; that is, the downward attraction of the mountain is greater than has been found generally on great elevations. The pendulum experiments show that the mea11 density for the whole mountain mass is quite equal to that of its surface density, and that the mountain is 11ot hollow, as has been claimed for most continental elevations, notably those of India. Using a densit,y derived from pemlulum observations, and considering the mountain as a paraboloid of revolution, an approximate value of its attraction at Kaupo ha,s been calculated. Applying this attraction brings the astronomical latitude to agree with the geodetic one, as carried around the island from the northern station at Haiku. At the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science held at Oleve1and, Ohio, in August, 1888, Mr. Preston, with the authority of the Superintendent, read a 1iaper he bad prepared on the Deflection of the Plumb-line and Variations of Gravity in the Hawaiian Islands. This paper was subsequently published in the American Journal of Science for NoYember, 1888. The general conclusions which he draws from his discussion of the Hawaiian obser\·ations he states as follows: I. Deflections of the plumb line are greater on island than on continental mountains, presumably on account of the lighter surrounding sea- water; an cl gravity is not in defect, because it is J11·re estimated from the true sea level, and not from a sea level by continental attraction. II. Deflections appear to be greater in the vicinity of extinct -Yolcanoes than near active ones. III. The so-called "bidden causes" which, in the case of the Himalayas, give a variation of gravity several times as great as those arising from the attraction of the mountains themselves, do not exist in the Hawaiian Islands. l\Ir. Preston acknowledges the umform kindness shown him, both by the members of the Government Surve~- and by the residents in different parts of the kingdom. In the pendulum observations he had the aid of .Messrs. F. S. Dodge and W. A. Wall, of the Hawaiian survey. All of the latitude and time observations were made by himself. The stations were selected by Professor Alexander. The following table presents the statistics of the latiturle work:

Special surveys and examinations, made at the request of the Department of 8tate and witk tltc approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, at Bitrnt Island, Mickigan.-A question haviug arise11 between the United States and the Dominion of Canada as to the exact location of a fishing net belonging to S. F. Tolsma, a citizen of the United States, which had been seized by the Canadia11 authorities, becl!use, as they alleged, it bad been spread in.Canadian waters, the Secretary of State ·, made request of the Secretary of the Treasury in M,irch, 1888, that the location, direction, and length of the net at the time of seizure shou hl be ascertained as nearly as practicable by a survey to be made by a competent officer of the Coast and Geodetic SurYey. Instructions were accordingly issued by the Superintendent to Assistant C. H. Sinclair, directing him to proceed, as early in the spring as the condition of the ice would permit, to Burnt Island, in Lake Huron, the locality of the seizure, and to locate and detPrmine carefu1ly, with reference to adjacent shore-lilies, the boundary between the United States and Canatl:t iu that vicinity, thiR location and determination of the boundary to be in exact conformity with the tracing of the Boundary Treaty Map furnished to this Office by the Department of State; also to ascertain, with reference to this boundary line, the position of the Tolsma net. Permission ha\'ing been obtained from the Canadian authorities for the establishment on Canadian ground of such stations as would be needed to be occupied in triangulation, Mr. Sinclair, soon after his arri\'al, May 22, having selected these stations, with others on the American side, determined the points required for a topographical survey of the shore-line of Burnt Island and other islands in the vicinity, and determined in position, with reference to the boundary line, the buoys that bad been set to mark the position of the To1sma fishing net. His report, date<l June 29, 18881 points out certain errors in the survey made by an officer of the Royal Navy before the breaking up of the ice in that year, and shows conclusively that the Tolsma net, when seized, was entirely within American waters. But one question was left open to be decided by subsequent measurements, that of the length of tbe net, the Canadian authorities claiming for it a length much beyond the maximum length of the nets that came under .Mr. Sinclair's examination. The results of his survey, which are shown on three tracings accompanying his report, were transmitted by the Superintendent to the Secretary of the Treasury under date of August 1; also a supplemental report with suggestions as to the advisability of marking the boundary in the locality of t.lJe fishing areas under survey, and a recommendation that in onler to give such marking an authoritative character both Governments should take part in it. Towards the end of August a letter was received from the Treasury Department inclosing a communication from the Secretary of State, transmitting to the Superintendent the thanks of that Department for the valuable report made by this Office.

The annual report of Office operations (Appendix No. 4) is submitted by Mr. B. A. Colonna, Assistant in Charge of Office and Topography. With it appear the reports for the fiscal year of the chiefs of the several Office Divisions. These indicate throughout a st~ady performance of duty, and a desire for the advancement of work by improved adaptations of means to ends, and by the introduction of better methods and processes whenever practicable. Assistant Charles A. Schott continues as heretofore in charge of the Computing Division. Mr. Schott alludes to the large amount of field-work which needs speedy reduction and discussion, and to the necessity for the employment of two additional computers, one fo1· magnetic, the other for geodetic reductions. By the resignation of Mr. Alexande1 Ziwet, which took effect September 23, 1887, the Division lost the services of a very able computer, thoroughly acquainted with the methods of calculation, and possessing also that general knowledge which added to the value of his work. Besides attending to correspondence referred to him from the Office, and directing the labors of theeomputerRi Mr. Schottdevoted much of his time to the preparation of special reports.

In the Drawing Division, under the charge of Assistant E. Bergesheimer, special effort was made to place the results ofreceut suryeys promptly before the public, and with the co-operation of the Engraving Division and by the aid of photolithography, charts of the resurveys in Delaware Bay and New York Harbor and approaches were prepared in a less time after the close of ftel<lwork than bad ever before been a.ccomplished by the Office. Charts reproduced on full scale from the original sheets by photolithograpby haYe been received with much fayor by the public. For local 1mrposes such charts are of great value. At the request of Ute Attorney-General of tlie United States, and for nse iu determining the title of the Government to the Potomac Flats, there were prepared for publication careful tracings of the Dermott Map (1798) and of the King Plats (1803) of the City of Washington. During some unavoidable absences of .Mr. Bergesheimer, l\fr. .A. Lindenkohl, Chief Draughtsman, directed satisfactorily the work of tlie DiYision. A tabular statement appended to the report shows what charts were completed or in progress dnring the year. The annual report of the Engraviug Division is submitted by Assistant Herbert G. Ogden, under whose administration its high standard of efficiency has been maintained. With the charge of the Engraving Division is associated the charge of operations in the Electrotype and Photograph rooms and in the Plate Printing office. A11 of the engravers were at times employed in making the miscel1aneons corrections to plates and additions on them that are required tu keep np to date Aids to Navigation, and the results of bydrographic examinations, resurveys, etc. This class of work is always one of great urgency, in order that the supply of corrected charts may be maintained for the use of the public. T!Jere were in hand for correction in these particulars during the year five hundred and fifty-seven plates. A number of engraved plates of important charts were completed . .Among them may be mentioned the Delaware Entrance from resurveys; Cape Fear River, showing recent improvements by tile Unitetl States Engineers; the Columbia Rh-er to Portland, and a general chart of the Pacific coast from Point Arena to Cape 1\Iendocino. Tabular statements of engraved plates begun and fiuii;;hed during the year accompany Mr. Ogden's report. Be refers to the receipt at the Office on April 21, 1888, of a copper-plate engraving of the City of Washington, believed to be a copy of the Boston plate. The original Boston plate is yet to be recovered. In order to obtain for the records of the Division a catalogue of engraved plates arranged in a geographical sequence so as to gh'e a conci8e abstract of the work representing a particular locality, Mr. Ogden began the preparation of such a catalogue, placing the work in the bands of .Assistant Edwin Smith, who was assigned to duty for this purpose, and who had completed a rough drai1ght of the catalogue at the date of being ordered to field duty in April, 1888. Mr. D. C. Chapman carried on most satisfactorily the operations of the Electrotyping and Photographing Division under .Mr. Ogden's general direction, and has submitted at his request a statement of the results of various experiments made and improvements introduced by him into the apparatus employed. The system of mounting photographic prints to scale was continued in successful operation, and at the request of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution an exhibit of the method was prepared for the Cincinnati Exposition. .A machine for filing the backs of electrotype plates, intended to save the labor and delay of filing the plates apart by hand, which was devised by Mr. Chapman and put up during the year, has worked well, furnishing a smooth even surface at a much reduced expenditure of time and labor. The Plate-Printing office was as heretofore in immediate charge of .Mr. F. Moore, Foreman. Mr. Ogden observes that this class of work is laborious and exacting, and it is therefore gratifying to find that the number of impressions suppli('d to the Chart Room, thirty-two thousand three hundred and forty-five is larger than for any preceding year. Mr. John R. Smoot continued as heretofore to perform the clerical work of the Division; great credit is due him for the care and precision with which this is clone. In December, 1887, the Chart Dfrision was organized, and .Assistant W. H. Dennis was instructed to take charge of it, his special duty being to have the custody of the charts and to direct their correction and issue. He reports that the total number of charts disposed of during the ~·ear was forty-four thousand five hundred and ninety-five, which was an increase of nearly thirty

per ce11t. over the issue of the year before. Of this number twenty-five tbousa1Hl two lrnmlred auu 8eventy-three were sent to agents for sale; eleven tbom;and six hundred and eight issued to meet demands from the Executive Departments, and two thousand four hundred and eighty-three in response to requests from members of Uong·ress. Mr. Dennis calls attention to the fact that duril1g the last six months of the ;year upwards of three thousand one hundred corrected charts were sent to tlfe Ilydrographic Office of the Navy, where, notwitbstanding the very critical examination to which tbey are subjected, not a single error was found for which the Chart Di·ision was responsible. This be attributes to the painstaking cnre of M:es~rs. Uarker aml 'Cppermau, who had immediate charge of making the corrections. Mr. Il. G. Eicl10ltz was continued in general charge of the Chart Room. Lists of new charts aclded to the Catalogue and tabular statements of charts on hand, received and issued duriug the ,rear, accompany Mr. Denuis' report. The report submitted by Assistant Andrew Braid of the operations of the Instrument Di·ision indicates a high 1:1tate of efficiency in that important department of the Otliee. Mr. Braid's efforts to place in thorough repair the means and appliances for making instrumentH were ably seconded by Mr. E.G. Fischer, Chief l\lechanician, and Mr. 0. Il. French, Chief Carpenter and Model 1\faker. All of the instruments needed on the Surw·y are now made in the shop. Among those construcwtl during the year were two astronomical transits for the use of the longitude parties from general ontlines submitted by Assistant Edwin Smith, and two geodesic le·els from plans iml>mitted by ~'\fr. Braid. Working drawings and patterns arc beiug made for six new eight-inch repeating theodolites, three of which will be adapted for latitude and azimuth work. Due attention was given to the miscellaneous duties of the DiYision, which include the care of the iustruments, camp equipage, and general propertJ'. Mr. R. C. Glascock served as Property Clerk during the year. The work done in the Tidal Division during the year is reported by its chief, Mr. A. S. Christie. Mr. L. P. Shidy has continued on duty as his principal assistant. Tide-tables for aU the principal ports on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts were prepared and published a year in aarn.nce. The latest data have been brought into requisition to irnprnrn the results for times and heights of high and low water, and the predictions have been extended to some new points. In addition to the current work, which was kept up promptly to date, a number of special investigations were undertaken by Mr. Christie. Among them were the following: A careful determination of mean half.tide level at Sandy Hook; ;tn inYestigation of the corrected establishments and ranges at San Francisco, California, and at Astoria, Oregon; an investigation of the West Florida, Cat Islaml and Biloxi, and Puget Sound tides, and a verification of the report made by Prof. G. H. Darwin in 1883 on the Harmonic Analyi;ds of the Tides, followed by the preparation of certain fundamental tables intended to introduce greater accuracy into the tidal reductions and predictions of the Survey. Mr. M. W. Wines has continued in charge of the Miscellaneous Division. In December, 1887, he was relieved from the duties and responsibilities connected with the custody aml issue of clia.rts by the organization of the Chart Division, and tl1e assignment of Assistant Dennis as its chief. The work of the Miscellaneous Division now includes the correspondence with sale ageuts relating to the publication of the Survey, the care of the account<'! connected therewith; the custody and issue of stationery; the care of the annual re1lorts when received from the Public Printer, and of the <mrrespondence between the Office and the Printer; the purchase of miscellaneous Office supplies and the supervision of the Offioo buildings. Tabular statements of the l'eceipt and issue of publications accompany Mr. Wines' report. Mr. Freeman R. Green continued to serve very acceptably as clerk to the Division. The annual report of the Archives and Library is submitted by Mr. Artema:,; Martin, who has remained in charge of the receipt and registry of the original and duplicate records, of the computations, and of the original topographic and hydrographio sheets, and has had also the care of the Library. With the report are tables showing the number of the several classes of re.cords aHd computations received and registered. Note is made of such topographic and hydrographlc sheets as were accompanied by descriptive reports. A card catalogue of the Library, which has been for some time in progress, is now nearly finished.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The complicated and laborious operations of the Accounting Division are fully dei;:cribed in the annual report presented by Mr. John 'V. Pitrsons, who bas remained in charge of it, and whose uuremittiug efforts to increase its efficiency both l1y personal labor and by the introduction of improvements in its organization, tieserve special recognition. The disbur8ements for the Survey continue to be made by, and the responsibility for them still rests with, .Mr. George A. Bartlett, Disbursiug Clerk of the Treasury Departmeut, who has hitherto 1ierforme<l this service without additional compensation. In order to Yerify readily the financial coudition of the Survey, and obtain a check against errors, there was established at the beginning of the fiscal year a system of semi-monthly trial balances and monthly balance-sheets showing the receipt aml expenditures under the appropriations. This 11yRtem was found by trial to bP very satisfactory, and its results were appro,·ed upon examinatio11 by a special committee from tlie office of the First Comptroller of the 'l'reasnry. McssrR. Eugene B. Mills, Accountant, and W. H. Lanman, General Bookkeeper; Mrs. S. M. Taliaferro, Book-keeper and Entry Clerk, and Miss Paula E. Smith, General Clerk, rendered very satisfactory snvice. In view of the facts that the work of the .Accounting Division is con8tantly increasing in volume and that much time is necessarily lost b,y the present arrangements for making disbursements, Mr. Par8ons, in concluding bis report, again urges the need of the Surwy liaving its own Disbursing Officer. Early in October, 1887, .Assistant 0. II. Tittmann was instructed to take charge of the Bureau of ·weightR aud l\Ieasures. Iu virtue of this assignment, be was directed to prepare for publication the manuscript of a report on the construction and distribution of Standards of Weight and Measure, which had been com1>iled chiefly by the late Assistant H. ·w. Blair, but which.bad not received the fiual revision of Professor Hilgard, then Supniuteudent. Before the report could be properly prepared for the Printer,· Mr. Tittmann found it necessary to indtx the records of the Weights and Measures Office. These records had been accumulating since 1344. The work was done with care and good judgment by Subassistant F. II. Parsons, under Mr. Tittmann's direction. Assistant .T. B. Weir was attached to the Di\'isiou during part of the fiscal year. He assisted in the comparisons of standard!! and in making and revising computations. The long experience and knowledge of details of Dr. J. J Clark, Adjuster, was of great service in the work of the year; he made all the weighings, assisted in the comparisons of standards, and prepared the Weights and Measures Exhibit for the Cincinnati Exposition. For the results of the experimental researches and the comparisons of standards of length and capacity instituted by Mr. Tittmann reference must be made to bis report. He urges the great need of having a comparing room so constructed that its temperature can be controlled artificially, so that at any time during the year comparisons of standards of length can be made at any temperature desired. An abstract of information furnished by the Division is appended to the report. In the Office Division, under the immediate direction of the assistant iu charge, Dr. W. B. French continued to ren<ler very efficient and satisfactory service as executive clerk. In the Office correspondence, and iu the preparation of the monthly reports, Miss S. C. .Ayres served very acceptably during the year, and during part of the year Miss F. Oadel. Miss S. B. Harvie, a skillful t.nie-writer, was transferred to the Treasury Department January 1. Miss K. Lawn served satisfactoril;y as type-writer during the year, and Miss U. Turnbull since March I, as copyist. Mr. W. B. Chilton continued to serve as clerk to the Superintendent, and bas made a. report stating the details of his clerical duties.

mission of tlie Port of Philadelphia; the different branches of the Government service located in i;he city, and tbe American Archaiological Society of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The facilities of the Sub-office were extended to the U. S. Advisory Board of the Harbor Com· mission, of which Assistant Henry Mitchell and Henry L. Marindin were members. Six sessions ' of the Board were hel<l at the Sub· office in 1887 and 1888, l\lr. Marindin acting as Secretary. He was also on duty in the Office at various times throughout the year. The records of the Board are in charge of Mr. Mccorkle. Assistant R. Meade Bache was on duty in the Sub-office during the greater part of the year. He made pantographic reductions of ele>en original sheets of the surveys of the Delaware aml Schuylkill Rivers from scales of 1-2400, 1-4800, and 1-5000 to one uniform scale of 1-9600, and made projections on this scale for prospectfre work on those rivers. He marle tracings of maps north of Philadelphia belonging to the City Engineer Office, and reproduced two old topographical sheets of the vicinity of Boston, l\fassachusetts. Assistant Charles M. Bache was on duty in the Sub-office at various times. Assistant McCorkle has submitted a full report of bis observations of the ice movement in Dela· ware River and Bay during the winter of 1887-1888. An abstract of this report is given under a beading in Section II. Sub·otfive at San Francisoo.-In addition to the various duties in·olvcd in bis assignment to the general charge of the land operations upon the Pacific coast, .Assistant George Da,·i<lson had charge of the Sub-office at San Francisco. He has attended to the official correspondence and answered all calls for information. He lla8 prepare(! special reports upon tbe Fisheries of Alaska, and the location for a <Jnarantine station at San Francisco. A public meeting having been called by the Mayor of the city to consider the location for this station, at which were present members of the State and City Boards of Health, the Supervisors, Surgeons of the Marine Hospital Service, and other prominent citizens, Mr. Davidson appeared and presented a chart of the bay upon which he had plotted the several sites suggested, taking occasion also to review their respective advantages or disadvantages. Subassistant Fremont Morse, while on duty under Mr. Davidson's direction at the Sub-office, made a minute inventory of all the Office property, including instruments and camp equipage. The store-room for this property is in charge of Mr. Vincente Denis, who, in addition to other duties, has faithfully attended to it for years. Mr. Morse prepared for the Archives the records and results of the field-work at Macho station, made a reduction of the transit observations at BaJch station of 18861 inked and traced the topographical sheets of Suisun Bay, an<l made descriptive reports of two of these sheets. He was occupied also upon the work of the latitude and time observations at Lafayette Park station, and gave assistance in the prepara.tion of the base bars for the field. This work, having been performed at the Sub-office, is here noticed in some detail.
PREP.A.RATION OF BASE BARS FOR THE LOS ANGELES BASE.

Ill connection with the main triangulation, Mr. Davidson made a thorough overhauling of the base bars used in the measurement of the Yolo base, in anticipation of their early use on the Los Angeles base. This work he did personally, as far as practicable, with the aid of Messrs. Lawson and Morse, and the mechanician's work was done under direct supervision. All of the .Borda scales were examined and the accidental imperfections CC)rrected. The indexes on two base bars, which had. become almost obliterated by their use on the Yolo base, were recovered and marked anew in their identical places. The standard was found to be injuriously affected by galvanic action between the steel and zinc bars and brass supports, but was cleaned and the Borda scales corrected. The ends of all the bars were in good condition, care having been taken to clean them systematically for the last seven years. In order to guard against rapid changes of temperature in the measuring bars, Mr. Davidson bacl all the wooden beams covered with two thicknesses of sluice blanketing, three-quarter-inch thick boiler felt, and then by canvaB. This done he had them removed for comparison tests to the pendulum house at Lafeyette Park station. Aronnd this house he bad been authorized to have a wooden shell placed, so that

it is now double walled and roofed, the space between the inner and outer building being about eight iuehes. The inside is lined with heavy paper, and the changes in temperature were found t-0 be small. For the base bars and the comparators, four brick and cement piers were built, and Messrs. Lawson and Morse were instructed to begiu a serie8 of comparisons in order to familiarize them with the work and detect any error of the workiug parts. To tl1e iudex or contact slide ends of the two bars, Mr. Davidsou had bad magnifiers adjusted; these are of great assistance in setting the slides at zero. The apparatus was thus made ready for crucial comparisons. In response to a request from the Superintendent. for an opinion upon the proper form ofbasebars for the measurement of geo<letic bases of the 11ighetit character, Mr. Davidson furnished a report and rough diagrams in explanation. The principal point to be decided, iR, iu his judgment, in the use <Jf a compound bar, or a Ringle steel bar of proper section, and with such coverings as will pren·nt any rapid change of temperature wlwn employed in the field. The connection of the thermometer should he by insertion of its bulb in mercury that is in contact with the bar itself. Ile expresses himself as satisfied the more he has tl1onght on the subject, and the more experience he bas gained with protected bars and beams, that the single well-protected steel bar is the best form, and that thrrmometers, connected with the bar as he recommends, will exhibit its temperature with reasonably close precision. Instruments.-The Assistant in Charge of the Office having submitted to Mr. Davidson for criticism the plans for a theodolite proposed for use on the Survey, he made a report thereon.
COAST PILOT WORK.

In October, 1887, l\Ir. Davidson transmitted to the Office the manuscript of the fourth edition of the Coast Pilot of California, Oregon, and \IT ashington Teri itory. Since that time he has accumulated much material that will be added in the proof-reading, and obtained the latest data relating t·l changes iu lights, buoys, etc. Ile b('gan the reduction of the Yie\rs which he liad made of headlands, points, island!'!, and rocks during the last twenty ~·cars. l\Ir. ·w csttlahl, under his direction, undertook Reveral special trips on tl1e coa11t steamers and on the Light-Ilou;;c ve;;sel to obtain views. Some photographs had also been 1wcure11. The whole 11u1111Jer of ,·iews is about four hundred, of which between three hundred and thn·e hundred and fifty are being reduce<l for tl1e Coast Pilot. Assistant Cleveland Rockwell was assigned to the special dnty of pn·pariug these views on bristol board, and. reported May 7, 1888. Ile h:ts given more than his regular office time to the work of reproducing them, and has imparted his artistic toucbeR to the sketches. In .March, 1888, under authority graute1l by the Secretary of the Treasury, Captain Shepherd, of the revenue-cutter Rush, conveyed l\Ir. DaYidsou down the coast as far as Piedras Blancas, in order that he might, get atltlitional views aJHl photographs for the Coast Pilot, and more particularly of the notable JaJl(l-fall the" Twins," which are five thousand feet above the sea-level, and only three miles from the shore.
AIDS TO NAVIGATION.

Recommendations with regard to aids to naxigation were made as follows, by Mr. Davidson: The placing of a Hght-liouse a11<1 fog.signal on the west end of Putos Island, and the same on the west eIHl of Stuart Inlet iu the Canal de Haro; the adoption of a fog-signal ship off the Bay of the Columbia River; of a light-homm aml fog-signal on Richardson's Rock off San Miguel Island, and of buoys off Point EucLon, and in the Uape Mendocino Passage, and in various other places. At the request of tlie SuperiutemlM1t, he wrote a description of the three positions available for a light-house at Point San Louis Ouispo.
FIELD CA'l'ALOGUE OF STARS.

During the year, outside of official hours, he was engaged in adding azimuth stars to the second edition of the Field Catalogue of stars.

He nearly completed also, outside of official hours, an exhaustive examiria.tion to identify Sir Fra.ncis Drake's landing in California in 1579. This research led him to gather many interestiug ~~harts relating to the subject, and especially those of Dudley, based upon the personal draughts of brake, C~t·emlish, and others. He obtained also the first photographs of the original charts from which Dudley compile1l those that appear in the Ascano del Mare, and upon tllese be found original magnetic variations by Drake, Cavendish, and others, and from latitude 400 to Cape Corrientes. :Even the local disturbance near Playa Maria Bay, in southern California, established by Kellett aud the latest observations of this year, is found in these charts. Mr. Davidson furnishes a list of the records, computations, and original sheets, topographic and hydrographic, with tracings, forwarded by him to the Office during the year. He acknowledges assistance recei·rnd from Mr. Charles B. Hill in Sub-office work until his resignation, and subsequently by Mr. Frank W. Edmonds. 'He commends Mr. Ferdinand Westdabl for his services as draughtsman, and for his willingness and promptness to attend to any matters that come up unexpectedly.
CONCLUSION.

Assistant Edward Goodfellow has been continued in charge of the preparation and editing for publication of the Annual Reports, and the Appendices thereto. He had also charge of the editing of the Bulletins of the Survey. The printing of the Report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1886, was completed, and the edition ordered by Congress was rccefred at the Office in July, 1888. Tluoughout the past year, ready co-operation has been afforded by other Departments and 11nreaus of the Government in the work committed to this Survey whenever such co-operation has bceu asked, and cordial acknowledgment has been made of the value of the services rendered by its officers to other Departments and Bureaus in response to official requests. I have speciaily to acknowledge the support of the Secretary of the Treasury in giving bis entire sanction to the transmission to Congress of increased estimates for the field-work, aud iu thus recognizing the fact, so often urged heretofore, tllat adequate appropriations for a work of this character yield larger results at a less comparative cost, and are therefore in the interest of a wise economy.

REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE OF OFFICE AND TOPOGRAPHY FOR THE YEAR
ENDING JUNE 30, 1888.
U. S. COAST AND GEODETHJ SURVEY 0I<'FICE,

Washington, November 18, 1888.
Sm: I have the honor to submit my annual report for tlle Office, and along with it the annual reports of the various Divisions thereof. The Computing Divifiiou has remained under the direction of its efficient chief, Assistant Charles A. Schott, who herewith subwits a detailed report of its operations. 1 beg to call especial attentiofl to the loss of some of our most skillful computers during the year, siwply because 1;heer 1wcessity drove them away, their salaries being so very small. Such computers as l\fr. Courtenay and Mr. Doolittle, who have bad years of training and whose ser\'ices are iuvaluable, only rt'ceini eighteen hundred dollars per aiinum. I earnestly recommend that tl1eir salaries he increased to two t,housand dollars per annum, aud that similar increases be made for other deserving 111e11 i11 this line of occupation. Notwithstanding the loss of some of its best mcu, the _Division bas furnished the usual amount of information in auswer to special calls. The n·sults of the Oouuecticut Triaugulation have been prepared for pulJlication, and numerous appendices prepared for the annual report. The Drawing Division has received the continued care of Assistant E. Ilcrgesheimer, who has made excellent progress wi°th the work. More charts have been published during this fiscal year than heretofore during the same length of time. 1\iucb progress has lleeu made in the arrangement of the drawings, etc., ouits tiles, and with additional ilclp it will ,·ery soou be in thorough working order. The facts in the ca~e of the output of our highest paid llleu in this Di\·ision go to illustrate the wisdom of getting first-class. wen aud paying them enough, when trained, to prevent their abandoning the work. It is much to the credit of some of the draughtsmen that they have foregone, to a. very grea.t extent, their annual leave, preferring to help the work along by devoting to it their entire time. Such service is deserving of the best pa,y and the highest consideration. The Engravfog Division has remained under the skillful management of Assistant IlerlJert G. Ogden. Very satisfactory progress has been made in all of its operations. Iu Electrotyping and Photographing, Mr. D. C. Chapman bas kept fully up ~o the work. His snccess in mounth1g a photograph on card-board to scale has been most gratifying and is a great relief to the Drawing Division. If our chart sales continue to increase as they have done during the Jmst year, the force of plate-printers must be increased to enable us to keep up with the demands. The Instrument Division has continued under charge of Assistant Andrew Braid, with Mr. E. G. Fischer as Chief Mechanician, and Mr. H. 0. French as Cl.lief Oari1enter aud Model Maker. The instrument and carpenter shops are now iu as high a state of efficieucy as they can he brought without increasing the force. With our plant and present facilities I would recommend the employment of about four apprentices at not exceeding six hundred dollars per annum each. These would in a. short t.ime be a.ble to ma.ke all repa.irs, etc., and enable us to keep our skilled men on the much needed new work. Economy and excellence in Coast Survey field-work has i1is foundation in the Instrument Shop. Good and rapid work requires good instruments. We are now manufacturing all of our instruments and endeavoring to get our whole instrumental outfit in perfect repair, We have already advanced so far as to be able to supply any party that we arc likely

to be called upon to equip, with all necessary instruments in from one to three hours' notice. On general outlines given by Assistant Edwin Smith, the Chief .\fechauician has constructed a pair of astronomical transits for our Telegraph Longitude work which are gidng entire !'atisfaction and excellent results. Mr. Otto ~tonn, mechanician, did most of the work on them. Assistant Andrew Braid, Chief of the Instrument Division, 11imself an officer of great experience in leveling operations, furnished the general outlines of two levels of precision which have been constructed hy the Chief Mechanician. The work 011 tl1ese was done chiefly by Mr. Theodore Gerhard. They Jia,·e stood all of the office tests to our entire satisfaction, but it remains for them to be tried in the field. The Instrument DiYision likewise has charge of the General Property of the Survey used in the tield-work. It is now carefully looked after, and a satisfactory account-can be given at any time of auy part or the whole of it. The great impmrnment in tlle Instrument Division and its present high state of efficiency are very creditable to its Chief, .Assistant Andrew Braid. The Tidal Division has-considering its want of proper help-made excellent progress. Our Tide Tables are now out very nearly a year in advance. Its Chief, Mr. Alex. S. Christie, has been untiring in bis attention to the work, and has been ably seconded by Mr. L. P. Shidy. The pretlictions have been extended to new points aud improved at some of the old ones. There is yet much, in fact a very great deal, to be done, and adequate and proper force is absolutely necessary to do it, in the best interest of the public service. The remarks made with regard to the smallness of the salaries in the Computing Division are equally applicable to the Tidal Division. The l\liscellaneous Division has remained under the charge of General Office Assistant M. W. vYines. The various and complicated duties of this Division of the Office have been thoroughly mastered by its Chief. There ir; 110 position in the service requiring a greater amount of technical knowledge awl its practical application tlrnu this. Almost any of the other Divisions of the Office min be filled creditably at once hy Yarious Assistants, but the knowledge of affairs and things re{1uired of tbe Chief of the MiHcellaueons DiYision would have to be acquired, and the loss of bis seryices would be felt as a serious inconwnience for a very long time. The labors of this Divi.sion of the Otlice have been largely increased of late, owing to our increased sales of charts, and its clerical force net>'11' an increase in uumhers and in pay. 'l'he Chart Division has been organized during the year, and at my request Assistant William II. Dennis eo1rnented to take charge of it. Ile l1as been entirely successful iu its management. His care and watcl1fulness have' promoted its eJllciency t.o such an extent that during the past six mouths an error on a chart issued by 11im has been almost unheard of. Few persons, even in the 8urrny, are aware of the patience and watchfulness requirt\cl to bring this about. Our Chart Catalogue is superior to what it has heretofore been and is well kept up to date by hand corrections. The Archins and Library, uudet Mr. A. Martin, has improved slowly. The cataloguing of the bookt> in the Library i::; very near]~- completed, and it is ho1wd that Mr. Martin will shortly be able to takll up the rnttaloguiug of the books <listrihutml throughout the Office. The arrangement of the Uecorcls in tJw Ard1in·.'l by St.ates has not yet heen taken in hand and will not be until .some one i:s a,·aiJahle fo1· tlie work who thoroughly nuder:;tan1ls our fieltl-work, and ca.n arrange the records without danger of confusion. The Division is, however, in better order than it was a, year ago. Tl1e Accou11ti11g Division lias remained under charge of Mr. J. W. Parsons. The onerons duty of making disuursemt~nts ou account of the U. S. Umtst aml Geodetic Survey has been contiuueil with Mr. Georg-e A. Bartlett, Dishursiug Clerk of the Treasury Department, and Oongreas has so far failed to compensate him iu an;y way for this additional work aull res1)ousibility. Every com;i<lerat.iou of just.ice d<·1w111ds that he should be paid for the service, aud the amount estimated, $500 per ammm, ii:; hardly enough. Mr. J. \V. Parsons has devoted hiR whole time, day and night t.o the accounts and their adjustment. II is s~·stem is about perfect, aud the reports of the expendi~ tnre of the appropriation, rendered by him to the Superintendent and transmitted to Congress, are models well worthy of close consideration. The Uureau of Weigl1ts and Measures, under the charge of Assistant O. H. Tittma.nn has been put iu order, an<l is daily growing in uSf\fulness. We have just cause for pride in it. report

herewit,11 is full of interest. 'Ve feel the want of a good comparing room very much, anti one must be constructed in one of the vaults under the sidewalk in front of the building. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1888, the following-named persons have been employed under my immedi~te direction, constituting what is known as the ''Office Division.'' Dr. William B. French has acted as my immediate clerk in matters of executive detail; received moneys from sales of charts, publications, old property, and other sources, for which he has satisfactorily accounted to me; has aided in the Office correspondence, and bas received all Office accounts and adjusted and arranged them on vouchers for my appro\'al, retaining a set of duplicate bills. Bis service has been very efficient and entirely satisfactory, and he should receive at least eighteen hundred dollars per annum for the services rendered. Mr. I~. M. Harvey bas filed the Office correspondence, receivc11 express and freight shipments, and attende1l to the reception ant1 dispatch of registered mail matter. The in finuities of old age are telling on his once powerful physique, and his failing eye-sight may necessitate his assignment to other duty. Miss S. C. Ayres has assisted in the Office correspondence, kept the leave of absence account book, prepared the monthly report of this Office, and otherwise been useful. Iler services ha'l"e been very acceptable and efficient. Miss S. B. Harvie was engaged upon type-writing to the close of December, 1877, and was transferred to the Treasury Department January 1, 1888. Miss Harvie had become particularly skillful in her work and was much missed. Miss K. Lawn used the type-writer during the whole year, rendering satisfactor.v work. Miss F. Cadel was detailed from the Tidal Division to the Office Division July 5 and assisted in the Office correspondence until returned to the Tidal Division on October 3. On January 4 she was aesigned to a type-writer and has since produced satisfactory work. Mrs. Virginia Harrison was occupied in miscellaneous copying from August 1, 1887, to January 4, 1888, and was then transferred to the Tidal Division. Mrs. M. E. Nesbitt was attached to the Office Division from January 4 to February 29, and was then returned to the Tidal Division. Mr. Neil Bryant has been mainly engaged upon miscellaneous copying for the Office Division, hut has occasionally assisted in clerical work for the II;ydrographic Inspector and for Assistant Henry Mitchell. Miss 0. B. Turnbull was assigned to this Division from the Tidal Division March 1, and has addressed envelopes, copied instructions, indexed ll'tter-books, and has done miscellaneous copying. Mrs. J. L. Waddill having been assigned to this Office by Assistant Secretary (Thompson) of the Treasury, and paid by that Department, was engaged in duplicating field records, copies of which we are to furnish to the State of Massachusetts. So far as I can ascertain, the Survey in the Field and in the Office was never in better condition than it is to-day. Harmony and good wilJ reign throughout the organization, and em11Ioyes vie with one another in the faithful performance of their respective duties. So far as this Office is concerned, its high state of efficiency is due to the Chiefi; of the respective Divisions and their subordinates, to whom I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks. The most cordial relations have existed between the Ilydrographic Inspector and the Office, and our hearty co·operation has done much to facilitate and improve the work. w·e are particularly indebted to Lieut. M. L. Wood, U.S. Navy, Assistant to the IIydrogmphic Inspector, who has been untiring in his efforts to contribute to the perfecting of our charts in C\'cry detail. Bis Kuggestions have been found to have practical value in every instance, and it has been inin· cipally on account of his agitation of the matter that the Chart Division of the Office, which has proved so successful under the management of Assistant William II. Dennis, has been established. -Yours, respectfully, B . .A.. COLONNA, Assistant in charge of Ojfice and Topography. Mr. F. M. THORN, Superintendent, Coast and Geodetie Survey.

The charge of the Computing Division was continne<l with the undersigned; the changes in the personnel, both of the 1>cr111anent and the temporars force, since last year's report, were as follows: Mr. Alexander Ziwet handed in liis rNdgnatiou September 23, 1887, and l\lr. Allan D. Histeeu left, after st>rving bnt for two weeks, in July, 1887. Iu tlic reisignation of Mr. Ziwet the Computing Division lost a very able computer; he was thoroughly acquainted with the methods of calculation, and possessed that general knowledge, which added so much to the Yalue of his Ren·ices. The training of a new computer for the ,·ariety of work placed in thi,,; Division of the Office is necessarily a laborious task, and one that cau not be accomplished in the periorl of a year; in consequence, the Telegraphic Longitude Computations could not be resumed this year, and the force oftbe Computing JJi\·isiou was further strained by the reduction of ge0tletic lfieling~, which demand much time. On September 6, 1887, l\fr. F. :\I. Uttle was assiglled to the Computiug Dh·isioa, and on Novemlier 1, 1887, 1\Ir. Louis A. Bauer w:rn assigned to dnt,y; tlte latter, after :~ satisfactory probationary term of six mo11ths, wa1:1 permaue11tly cmmPde<l with the Di,·ision. Temporary help was giyen as follows: .Assistant .T.

The work performed by each computer during the fiscal year is herewith presented in detail, as made up from the daily and monthly reports. Edward H. Courtenay completed the adjustment of the several triangulations of the Patapsco ltiYer, and of th~ vicinity of Baltimore, between the years 1842 and 1886; adjusted the olll and hew triangulations (1886) of Core Sound and of Beaufort Harbor, N. C., ai1led in the re-computation of the old triangulation between Beaufort and Cape Fear, N. C., basiug tLe same on modern standard data, and completed the final adjustment of the se->cral triangulation8 in the State of Connecticut between 1833 and 188fi, a work of great maguitu<le and complexity. He ahm adjnKted and based on standard data, the triangulation of the we8tern coast of Florida, between Charlotte Harbor and Ot>dar Keys; had charge of the Compn ting Di\'iRion for two weeki;; durmg my abst>n<'e, prepared gPodetic data for use by iiehl parties, and in rP8Jl0111'e to calls by corrt>spomlen ts; had charge of the geqgraphical registers and of the duplicate records of the Sun·ey relatiug- to astro11omy, geodesy, and magnetism, prepared part of the geodetic statistic8, and supenised tlie work of Mr. Little and Mr. Maupin. Myrick II. Doolittle computed the following triangulations: Of Sauta Catalina Island, Cal.; of Wilktmette Wver between its mouth and Portland, Oregon, 1883; of tbe coast of LoniKiana, west of Barataria Bay, 1886-'87; adjusted and based upon standard data tlie main triangulation between Cape Florida and <Jape Sable, and re-computed on standard data the intervening subor<liuate triangulations, ] 854-'87 ; computed the tria11gnlation between Cape Sable and Cape Romano, Fla., 188fi-'87, and computt>d the line measures up tbis coast to Tampa BaJ; mljnsted tbe triangulation of Monterey Bay, Cal. (1852-'84), aud of the coast from Santa Cruz to Point Afio Nuevo (1864); computed the Blue Buck base-line, Louisiana, 1883; prepared abstract of horizontal direction.~ at primary station Mocho, Cal., 1887; adjusted tLe main triangulation of the coast between the Golden Gate aml Santa Barbara Cliannel, inYolviug the estal>1isbment and solution of forty-three normal equations, and assisted in the preparation of geodetic statistics. Uharles H. Kummcll assisted Mr. Courtenay and Mr. Doolittle in the solution of normal equations iu connection with the final adjustment of the triangulations of Uonuecticut and in southern California; compnted the gcograpl1ical positions of the following triauguhitions: Of ihe coast of Oregon, between Umpqua River :-ind Coos Bay, 1882-'85; of the Gulf of Georgia, Wash. Ter.; of Charlotte Harbor, Fla.; of the State Surve~' ofWiseonsiu, 1&15; of the James River, between City Point and Richmond, 1852-'80, basing the same on standard data; computed the triangulation of the Mississippi River Commission to fill up the gap between Greenville, Miss., and Helena, Ark., 1880-'81, basing it on our standard data; computed the triangulation of St. John's River, Florida, 1885, and attended to miscellaneons geodetic computations and revisions. , Heury Farquhar completed the reduction of the astronomical latitudes of fi\·e f tatious on the Virginia and North Carolina boundary, 1886-'87; computed tbefatitudes of four secondary stations in Kentucky and Illinois, 1882, and of Little Rock,' Ark., 1882, and made progress with the reduction for latitude of seven secondary stations in Kentucky, Tennessee, I udiana, Illinois, and West Virginia. 1883. Mr. Farquhar also supplied the mean places of stars required by field parties; and made satisfactory progress with the star places required for fourteen latitude stations of the Hawaiian sur>ey, 1887, undertaken with a view of studying the remarkable local deflections of the plumb line in these islands. The total number of stars for which north polar distanee is required is565, and these are selected and discussed, using all available star.catalogues, and they are adapted as near as may be to the standard places of Auwers. Alexander Ziwet computed the astronomical azimuths of Station Tassel, N. Y., 1880, and Station Howlett, N. Y., 1883, and had nearly completed the comput.ation of the telegraphic difference of longitude, Colorado Springs, Colo., and Kansas City, Mo., .1885, at the dato of bis resignation in September, 1887. John B. Boute1le was chiefly engaged in various revisions of abstracts of angles, and in com· puting triangle sides and geographical positions in connection with the final adjustment and com· putation of the triangulations in the State of Connecticut and adjacent parts of New York, and of Clearwater Harbor, Fla.; he also supplic<l copies of reports of a professional character. Allan D. Risteen served as a computer for two weeks and was engaged in the computation of geographical positions, \'icinity of Baltimore, Md.

William C. Maupin was engaged in copying descriptions of stations for field parties, and in inserting results of geographical i)ositions in the Office registers; he att-0nded also to miscellaneous copying and conversions of measures and .-erifications. l"rauk M. l.Jittle revised angles and compute(l triangle sides and geographical positions in New York, Connecticut., and North Caroliua (Beaufort to Cape Fear), muler tlw direction of Mr. Uourtenay; computed a num!Jer of geographical positions in Tampa Bay and on the west coast of Florida np to Cedar Keys ; after the middle of March he was engaged on the Office computation of the spirit-levels between Vhlkersou's Ltmding, J\Iiss., and Little Rock, Ark., 1887-'88; this is now very nearly completed. Louis A. Bauer was engaged in the reduction of spirit-levels about New York Bay and Ilar· bor, Staten Island, 1887, and Gornrnor's Islaml to Throg's Neck, 1886-'87; made the reduction of the spirit-leYels between Mobile and Citronelle, Ala., 1884, and between Meridian and Okolona, Miss., 1884; computed the time and azimuth at three stations in Oregon; computed the astronomical azimuths at thirty stations in couuection with the magnetic declinations observed in 1887; assistetl me in the solution of normal equations connected with my discussion of the secular variation ofthe declination and in proof-reading of my report on the magnetic work done at Fort Uonger, 1881-'84, by Lieutenant Greely and party; attended to some geodetic revisions, reduced the spirit-levels between .Meridian and Quitman, .Miss., 1886, and made satisfactory progress with the reduction of the spirit-levels between Quitman and Citronelle, Ala., 1887. John B. Weir, assistant, computed the levels about New York Bay and Harbor, 1887, from observations made by Snbassistant McGrath. George A. Fairfield, assistant, prepared abstracts of angles and directions of the triangulation of the coast of Louisiana east of Sabine Pass, 1883. James B. Baylor, assistant, tested the figure of the axles of the dipping needles of Circle No. 20; reduced the magnetic observations at two stations in Michigan, and computed some positions on the upper part of James Uh·er, Virginia.

The impressions for the Chart-room were printed from six hundred and sixty-four plafos, of which number five hundred and fifty-seven required miscellaneous conectious applied to them before the impressions could be taken. The engravers were employed during the year principally as follows: Il. l\I. Knight, A. Petersen, J. G Thompson, and R. I!'. Bartle, jr., on lettering; II. T. Knight and H. L. Thompson 011 outlines and lett-0ri11g; W. A. Thompson, R. F. Bartle, and H. C. Evans on topography and sand; J. Enthoffer on topography; E. H. Sipe on miscellaneous collections and additions and lettering ; and T. Wasserbach and W. B. Davis on miscella.neons corrections and additions. There bave also been employed at different times during the year, under the appropriations for extra en. graving and the "urgent deficiency bill," that became available in April, Messrs. J. P. Cox, J. C. Entwistle, E. J. Enthoffer, E. Von Logan, and E. A. Maedel on lettering, and W. H. Dougal on correction of views illustrating the Coast Pilot. All the engravers employed in the Office have at times been engaged on the miscellaneous corrections and additions applied to the plates before printing, that arise from changes in the aids to navigation, hydrograpbic examinations, re-surveys, etc. This class of work is always one of great urgency in order that the supply of corrected charts may be maintained for the use of the public. The five hundred and fifty-seven plates corrected during the year in these particulars in· volved a large amount of labor to the engravers, and consumed a considerable portion of the time in the Office of the Division in their verification and record. The year's work shows a number of important charts completed, of which "~'he Delaware Entrance," from the re-surveys; The Cape Fear River, with the recent improvements by the U. S. Engineers; The Columbia River to Portland; A General Chart of the Pacific Coast from Pt. Arena to Cape Mendocino, and additions of the recent off-shore hydrograpby to the General Charts of the Atlantic coast from the capes of the Delaware to Cape Hatteras, are the most worthy of notice. The work executed under the " urgent deficiency bill" bas also advanced the most important of the unfinished plates to a state of progress that promises favorably for fruitful results in the coming year. Had this appropriation become available a few months earlier it would have made a more marked increase in the output of the year, but the number o.f plates that could be finished in the short three months after it passed was too limited to make much impression with completed work; the aggregate of engraving that was accomplished, however, in forwarding important charts, has been very material. The work in the Electrotype and Photograph rooms has been performed most satisfactorily by Mr. D. O. Chapman, assisted by Mr. L. P. Keyser. The amount of copper deposited has not been

so large as in former years, as the work has heen confine<l entirely to l)Ur own necessities. Some changes have been made in the arrangement aud care of the batteries that it is believed will show a greater economy in their use, but as comparative results from their actual working are slow of attainmeut, a dNailed statement must be. deferred for the prese?1t. Many improvements have heeu made hy Mr. ()liapman since taking charge of the work, the most important of which I have 11otice1l in my successin~ annual reports; hut that they may be a matter of record for fnture reference, '.\Ir. Chapma11 lrns summarized them in a special report dated July 17, 1888, a copy of which I have the honor to transmit herewith. The machine for filing tlw hacks of thf' electrotype plates, 1l(wised hy .M:r. Chapman and erected about six months ago, has proved ,-cry satisfactory, furnishing a smooth, even surface at a much rc1l11ce.d expenditure of time arnl la\Jor, aud JiuiHhiug tht\ plates in a more suitaule condition for printing. The system of mouuti11g photographic prints to scale has continued in sncccssful operation, and an exhibit of the !Il('thotl Juts bel~ll prepan~1l at, the re(juest ot the Secretary of the Smithsonian lnstitntio11, to form :t part of au exhibit at Cincinnati hy the Institution, showing the progress and applicatious of photography. In compliance with ;vonr directionri, experiments lun-e been made by l\Ir. Chapman in gilding weig-hts matle of the Ilassler bra:ls. A 1cry ltand:-;011w gilt has been obtained by immersing the weights in a hot hath of pyrophosphate of sotb aud chloride of gold, but it is yet to be determined if the gilt, is enduring all(l in all respects suitahle for the rrnrpose. 'l'he Plate Printing Oftice has beeu conducted as heretofore by l\Ir. F. l\Ioore, foreman, with Messrs. BooYer, Beck, and Crawford as printers, and Messrs. Troutman, Shelton, and Dickson as helpers, the latter having been appointed to the Otlice April 21, 1888, at the time 1\Ir. Shelton was rc·lieved. This class of work is Jaboriot1s aud exactiug, and it is tlierefore gratifying to find the year's output for the Chart-room thirty-two thousand three hundred and forty-five impressions, a larger 11nm ber than for a11y preeediug year. A,; outlined in a report several ;years ago, the demand ou the Printing Office is steadily 011 the increase. This is dne, primarily, to two causes, the charts become more widely distributed, increasing the number of persons who use them, and new charts are constantly being added to the list from which additional prints must be furnished. If the demand were equalized over the year we 8ltoultl be fully able to supply it with our present force, Lut unfortunately during the summer months it far exceeds the other seasons, aml the nature of the matter to be supp lied preclrnle,:; the possibilit:r of providing it in advance during the duller months. Duriug May, .June, an1l ,July the presses turned out more work for the Chart-room than during the same months for auy preYions year, and yet we were constantly behind the orders on many of the standard ch<trts, and within a few days it has been found necessary to start the fourth press by the employment of temporary labor, which will have to be continued until the pressure is relieved. It is hoped the addition of motive power to the presses will be fully accomplished during the enrrent year, as that will atlord a great measure of assistance, but at the same time we should not lose sight of the fact that this class of work increa8e<s naturally, and that it can not be long before the force will ha,ve to be supplied to run the fourth press continuously. The clerical work of the Division has been maintained by Mr. John H. Smoot with his usual energy and precision, and reflects great credit to bis ability and perseverance. Assistant Edwin Smitll reported to me for special dut.r in the Division on January 4, 1888, and wa;i immediately assigned the work of cataloguing the engraved copper plates. I have h&d such a catalogue in contemplation for several years, and had gradually obtained proofs of the old plates as opportunity offered, until the data had been collected that would warrant work on the catalogue as soon as some one could be made available to take it np. It was therefore a source of great pleasure to me when .Mr. Smith was assigned to the Di>ision for this purpose. He continued on the duty until April 3, 1888, when his ser>ices were required in the field. A rough draught of the catalogue was completed and books hare been ordered for the fair copies. The records of the Engraving Dirision show the inception, time, cost, and completion of each engraving, and fully satisfy the requirements for the work of the Division. But as they are divided into day books, correction books, time and cost ledgers, and historical records with the single purpose of recording the history of each plate, they are not in a geographical s~quenoo to

give a concise abstract of the work representing a particular locality. The frequeut demand by engineers for copies of our original surveys and re-surveJ·s, for comparison with recent work, led me to believe that a catalogue of the engraved work that coul<l be furnhihed, arranged by local ities, would be instructive as well as very useful. It should be remembered, in this connection, _that our chart catalogue contains only the stawlard charts of the surveys tliat are reliable at the 'present time; that charts representing stuveys that :ue obsolete, are condemned and speedily dropped out of the chart catalogue, and that there is, therefore, no publication of the Survey that shows the engraved material of the past that is available for study and comparison. On April 7, 1888, one hundred and eighty copper plates were recefred from the Public Printer, representing a mass of miscellaneous material that I have not yet been able to clasilify, owing to the great demand ou the Printing Office for charts having prevented getting proofs of all the plates up to this time. The plates thus far examined were in Yery bad condition, not lrn,·iug been prop· erly protected when last printed. These plates will be listed and reported to J·ou at the earliest opportunity. The Office has also received from ]\fr. D. l\foClelland, April 21, 1888, a copper-plate eugraYing of the city of Washington, that has been designated a copy of the Boston plate, aoi1d I heliern completes the resurrection of the early copper plates of the plan of the city, except the original Boston plate.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Wasliington, July 17, 1888. DEAR SIR: In compliance with your request of June 30, asking for a statement of the results of various experiments I have conducted in this Department, I respectfully submit the following: When I was assigned to the Photograph and ElectrotJ·pe Department of your Divtsion there was a desire to have the maps reduced by photography and mounted on card-board to the exact scale required in the transfer to the copper to be engra\·ed. After a few days' study of the subject and a fow experiments, I devised a frame for the purpose, by the aid of which a map may lle photographed and mounted to a reduced scale in very much less time than had been done heretofore, as attested by the large amount of this class of work that has since been done by this method.
STEEL F.A.CING.

In my first attempt at steel facing I found that a part of the current jumped from the iron anode to the lead lining of the vat (holding the solution) and passed around to the back of the cathode, making the deposit on the face of the cathode slow and uncertain, and also reducing the strength of the solution by not having sufficient anode surface. To obviate this I put another anode at the back of the cathode; also put a piece of board at the back of the cathode between it and the anode, and have since then had no trouble in making a clean hard deposit.
SCR.A.P ZINC.

In the use of the battery for electro deposition I found that there was an accumulation of scrap zinc covered with mercury, which heretofore had not been utilized. To make use of this I bave deviSed and made a frame for holding this material in the battery so that the zinc could be freely used up, and leaving the mercury, which is used again, thus avoiding either waste of zinc or mercury.

SILVERS AND CAitBONS IN 'l'HE BATTERY.

Experiments for the purpose of determining the relative efficiency of the platinized silvers and the carlion plates nse1l in tlrn battery have showu tbat the platinized silvers deposit more than double the amount of copper tliat, tlrn carhom; do, the deposit with the silvers being two bun· drotl and thirty grains per hour, while tlie car!Jous gave only ninety grains per hour. 1 found that it required three times the amount of acid with the carbons that it did with the silvers to produce approximately the same deposit, or nearly three times the amount of zinc and carbon surface iu the same solution.
RENEWING TIIE BATTERY.

I found that the method of renewing the battery by empt;ying the cells and making up an entire new solution did not give the best results, sol leav(\ a portion of the zinc sul1ihate in the cells and add acid and water whenever they re<1nire to Le strengthened, which gives less internal resistance and a more uniform rate of deposit. I have made several experiments to t~st the conductivity of the copper electrolyte, and found that the best results were obtained b,y using a solution of fifty to sixty grains of copper crystal to the ounce of water and one-twentieth part sulphuric acid, so we get from the same battery considerable more COJlper deposited per day than we did with the old electrolyte.

TES'l'ING THE CONDUCTIVITY ·

The labor of filing the plates apart by hand, and great delay in delivery of the work that some· times ensued, induced me to devise a machine to assist in this work (the power being already at hand in the adjoining room). Tl!e machine lrns been in operation now about five months, and bas proved very satisfactory, re(lncing the time required in filing the plates fully fifty per cent. Yours, very respectfully, D. C. CHAPMAN. Mr. H. G. OGDEN, .Assistant in ckarge of Engraving Division.

Washington, July 1, 1888. DEAR Sm: During the fiscal year 1S87-'88 thr Drawing Division has remained iu my charge. For the first nine months of the year the number of draughtsmen remained the same as the year preceding. Dnring tl!e last three months under the deficiency appropriation five additional dranghtinnen were employrd. The assignmentof work has been about the same as the preceding year, as follows: A. Lindenkobl was mostly emplo,ve(l npon b;n!rographic reductions, corrections of and additions to puhlisbed charts, progress sketcheH for the A unual Heport, and auswering various calls for information. Ile has rendered valuable service, at times, by directing the work of the Division during the absence of its Chief. H. I,indenkohl was mostly engaged upon finished drawings for photolithographing, and all kinds of work requiring di>·patch. Ile bas also done the usual amount of lithographing for the Annual Report. During the year he !ms done an unusually large amount of valuable work. E. H. Fowler has made reductions for engraving and photolitliographing, 1)rojections, and verifications . .E. .T. Sommer has made reductions for engraving and photolithographing, projections, and verifications. P. Erichsen has been mostly engaged upon inking topographical sbeets and measuring areas of engraved work. E. Molkow has worked upon reductions for harbor charts for engraving, inked topographical sheets, made projections, aud measured areas of engraved work and topographical surveys. C. Mahon has been employed principally upon hydrographic re-duciioRs and lettering plane· table sheets. E. A. Trescot has made drawings of charts and diagrams for pbotolithographing, and registered for the Division the original topographical and hydrographic charts. At times he has performed the clerical duties of the Division.

J. Olberg has made the usual copies of field sketches. W. H. Benton bas been mostly engaged upon drawings of charts for photolithographing. H. J, Schneider bas made miscellaneous tracings, especially those to answer calls by private riarties for copie!l of original surveys. During nearly three months of the latter part of the year W. Baumann, G. F. Kroll, F. ,T. del Corral!, and G. Wedekind were engaged as temporary draughtsmen; \V. Baumann upon a chart for pbotolithographing, and the others upon miscellaneous work and tracings. C. G. Bouis was attached to the Di\'ision about two weeks on trial. J. H. Roeth performed the clerical work of the Division m1til January 9, 1888, when he was transferred to the office of the Hydrograpbic Inspector. From January lG to May 16 Assistant W. I. Vinal was attached to the Division, and rendered efficient service by regist(lring seveml thousands of miscellaneous maps and drawings, which had accumulated in about forty years. In addition to the list of charts submitted, which comprises all the regular publications, for which the drawings have been advanced or eompleted, there have been prepared, at the request of t,be United States attorney for the District of Columbia, careful tracings of the" Dermott Map" and of the" King Plats" of the city of Washington for the purpoSll of being pbotolitbographed. I desire to say that the number of skilled draughtsmen in the Division is inadequate to the demand made upon it for all purposes. We want more of tlie best, for the best are always to be preferred from the ti.tamlpoiut of economy. Special effort, bas been made to put the results of the most recent surveys promptly before the public, and we h!'tve succeeded, with the co-operatiou of the Engraving Division and by photolithography, in mapping the important resurveys iu Delaware Day, New York Harbor, aud East Hiver in shorter intervals from the time of the resnrYcys than ever before accomplislied by the Otlice. Spe,cial attention has been given t{> such parts of the coast as were inadequately supplied with charts, notably the west coast of Florida aud the coasts of Oregou and of Washington Territory. A number of charts, local aud general, of these sections were commenced or issued, and efforts are still continued in this direction, so that it is hoped that at 110 distant day all parts of the coast will be provided with charts. The gratifying reception by the public wbich our full-scale pbotolitliographed charts have had during the past year, encourages our hest efforts in that direction. The chart which gives the most information will be in must demand for local purposes. Respectfully, yours, E. HERGESHEIMER, .Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, I1~ charge of Drawing Division. Mr. B. A. COLONNA, .Assistant in charge of Ojfice.

U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 0FFICE 1

Washington, July 1, 1888. Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report of the Chart Division for the year ending June 30, 1888: The custody, correction, and issuing of charts was made a Division on tlm 15th of December, 1887, and I received instructions to take charge; previously this had been a part of the Miscellaneous Division. As now organized the duties are: To receive all charts from whatever source; to give notice when a new supply is required; stamp the catalogue number aml date of printing on each; color the buoys, lights, and sectors; correct and verify them up to the date of issue from the Division, marking that date upon them; to fill all orders for charts, and to keep a book account of the numbers received and issued. The total' number of charts disposed of during the past year is 44,595, being an increase of .285 per cent. on the issue of the previous year. This is in part due to the number of new charts added to the catalogue, of which there were nine from plate-printing and eleven photolithograph charts. Allowing for these the per cent. increase is about .26. A veragiag the total number of charts issued with the full number in the catalogue, shows that about one hundred and thirteen of each were disposed of the past year, against eighty-nine and four-tenths for t~e year before. Of the assistants in the Division, Mr. ILG. Eichholtz has had ~eneral charge of the Chart Room. Mr. J. H. Barker, with the verification and correction of charts, has Mr. Archie Upperman as his assistant. The fact that during the past six months some three thousand one hundred and nine corrected charts have been sent to the Hydrogra phic Office of the Navy, where they are subjected to a most critical examination, and that in no case has a single error or oversight been fonnd for which this Division is at fault, tellR strongly of the painstaking care of both Messrs. Ilarker antl Uppermau. Mr. J. L. Smith has been employed in stamping the catalogue number, etc., on tpe charts, printing slips, etc. Miss L.A. Mapes has had charge of the books, and wllen not engaged on them has been employed in coloring buoys, correcting catalogues, etc. Miss Mary Thomas has been engaged in coloring buoys, lights. Miss Sophie Hein in chart and catalogue corrections, and in coloring light-sectors. Mrs. Jennie H. Fitch commenced work on the 4th April coloring buoys and lights, and has also made ready for mailing some four t110usand copies of Appendix: 12 of 1886, and letters accompanying, and has also nearly completed an alphabetical list of the parties to whom they were sent. Miss May Thomas was engaged in correcting catalogues. Mrs. A. E. White was in this Division about eight days (in May), and Miss Lizzie l:C:.obinsou from May 19 to June 30, both employed on catalogue corrections. I have much pleasure in saying that all the employes in the Division, by their energetic attention to their duties, are deserving of special commendation. Respectfully, yours, W. II. DENNIS, Assistant U. S. Coast mid Geodetic Survey, In charge of Chart JJiviswn.

REPORT OF THE INSTRUMENT DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1888.

U. S.
DEAR

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, August 22, 1888. Sm: I ham the honor to submit the following report of the Instrument Division for the fo;cal year ending June 30, 1888: During the year no change bas been made in the personnel of the Division, excepting that caused by the resignation of Mr. W. Suess, December 31, 1887, and the employment in his place of Mr. 0. Storm. The latter entered upon his duties January H, 1888. The equipment of the instrument sht>p has been further improYed by the addition of sundry minor tools and a new lathe, of large size; and that of the carpenter shop by the addition of a new improved lathe, also of large size. As was anticipated, the betterment of the shop equipment has resulte<l in an improvement both in the quality and quantity of the work produced, and I take pleasure in reporting that we are now in 11 condition to turn out new instruments of the highest grade. Several first-class instmments, whioh will be noticed furt.her on, have already been made, and others are now ou hand. A number of old instruments have been entirely or partially reconstructed, all(l the usual large amount of repairs and alterations of fieM instruments has been attended to. The large and increasing amount of repairing constantly required, necessarily limits the production of new work, and I shall therefore recommend that in future two additional mecha.niciaus be estimated for. This increase of force will be necessary from the fact that many of our ohler instruments are becoming worn and unfit for use· and will have to be replaced by new ones, which our present small force will be unable t.o supply with sufficient rapidity. A new theodolite, for example, of the sizes and patttarn recently approved, will occupy a good mecbanician for at least four months, and when he is frequently compelled to lay aside his work temporarily, as is now the case, to attend to repairs, etc., more urgently needed, it is obvious that the work of renewing our stock of instrument.a will be a slow one, and that a.considerably larger force oonld, for a time at least, be a.dvantageonsly employed. The following is a list of new instruments made or partly made during the year, and of old ones reconstructed: Six three-armed protrootors, two thirty-seven-inch astronomical transits, two goodeaie micrometer levels, two sounding registers, thirty specimen caps, twelve plane table alidadea (reeonatrueted), two theodolite magnetometers (reconstrncted and enlarged), three micrometse, t.wo large Steinheil heliotropes, sundry metric scales, etc., ete.

132

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The above were all completed within the limits of the fiscal year excepting the heliotropes and alidades; the former, however, were completell by July 10, but the latter, owing to numerous interrn11tfons caused by urgent repairing work, will not be finishe<l until the latter part of August. Tile two new transits are of the most approved pattern; have all the modern improvements, aud are, in short, first-class instruments. Each has a telescope of focal length 37 inches, clear aperture of 3 inches, and magnifying powers from 37to108. The pivots are cylindrical and made of bell-rnetal, tlie y,;, being of "half-hard'' brass. .A.gate bearings ltavc been discarded, and the azimuth and level adjustments arc made at the base instead of at the axis; this maintains a constant relation between the ys and piYots, and gives a more perfect bearing surface. The inclined surfaces of tlie ys are true plaues iustead of curved surfaces, and the cylindrical pivots consequently bear throughout their length instead of at single points as in the ohler instruments. The final turning of the pfrots was made by l\fr. E.G. Fischer, who succeeded in bringing their inequality within one-tenth of a di\·ision of the le\'el, a division (2 mm) of level having a value of 1".2. These instruments are now in use hy the longitude parties, and it is confidently expecood that after a thorough trial they will be found s~1perior to any of the transits heretofore used by the Survey. The two new Geodesic Levels are of the same pattern as Level No. 1, the instrument used on the transcontinental line of levels from Sandy llook to St. Louis. One of tltese instruments is now at the Cincinnati Exposition, and the other will shortly be used on the line of levels from Washington to Annapolis. The twelve alidades, although marked in the list as "reconstructed," are practically new instruments, as all tlte parts excepting the telescope tubes have been renewed. The other new instruments in the list do not call for special mention. Working drawings arnl patterns are now being made for six new 8-inch Repeating Theodolites, three of which will be adapted for latitude and azimuth work; six new Geodesic Leveling Rods have ahm hecn commenced, and the construction of twenty-four Three-armed Protractors will shortly be begun. During the year Mr. E. G. :Fischer has performed the duties of Chief Mecltanician, and has had immediate supervision of the details of the work in the instrument shop. To his ahility, skill, and zeal the satisfactory results are in a large measure due, and 1 take this occasion to express my bi~h appreciation of the value of his services, and to thank him for his hearty co-operation in the efforts to increase the cfficicnc,y of the DiYision. l\lr. H. 0. French has, a., heretofore, had immediate charge of the work of the carpenter shop, and has performe<l his 1luties in his usual cnicient and thorough manner. The miHcellaneous dutif1s of the Di,·ision, including the care of the iustrnments, camp-equipage, and general property, the receipts and shipments of the same, the examination and adjustment of instruments, and determination of i.nstrnmcntal constants, the purchase of new instruments and supplie8, the official corn·spondence, and the keeping of the records and inventories have like· wise received due attention. The following statement shows in detail the force employed during the year and the character of the work perfornwd by each : l\lr. B. G. Fischer, Uhief Meehauician, has made such graduations as were required of theodolites, sextants, protmctorR, ali1lade arcs, aml transit circles, and lrns made tl!e working drawings for the use of the pattern-makers and mcclninicians.

REPORT OF THE TIDAL DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, FOR THE YEAB ENDING JUNE 30, 1888.
TIDAL DIVISION

U. S.

Co.A.ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, D. O., June 301 1888. SIR: I have the honor to submit herewith the report of this Division for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1888. The work accomplished during the year may be summarized as follows: 1. Au aggregate of .five years, eight mouths of record from automatic tide-gauges, five years nine months of tabulated high and low waters and half-hourly ordinates from the same gauges, two years one month of meteorological observations, one year of observed temperatures and densities of the sea; one hundred and fourteen original and one hundred and eight duplicate volumes of observations on staff and box gauges have been received, examined, and registered, and one hundred and thirty letters prepared relating thereto. 2. The proofs of the tide-tables for the Pacific Coast for the year 1888, one volume octaYO, have heen read and differenced. The like tables for both the Atlantic and Pa.cific Coasts for the year 1889, two volumes octavo, have been prepared, read, and twice differenced in proof. 3. An aggregate of one hundred and one tide-notes has been furnished for publication on thirty-eight eharta, and thirty-one tide-not.es have been prepared in response to three requisitions from the. Goa.st Pilot Division. 4. For use by field parties, seventy.five descriptions of tidal bench-marks, with heighta above the plane of reference, etc., have been furnished in response to twenty-three requisitions.

134

UNITJ<JD STATBS COAST A;\I> GEODETIC SUUVEY.

5. Tidal datri and information have been prepared and furnished in reply to twenty-six calls from persons uot connected with the Survey. 6. A careful and lal>orious determination of mean half-tide level at Sandy Ilook, N. J., from the two series, Jauuary 1, 1882, to August 31, 188-!, a1HI December 1, 1886, to April 1, 1.888, has been made. 7. An iuvestigation has been made into the correct mean establishments and rauges at San Francisco, ()al., and Ai,.;toria, Oregon. That at A~toria has lwen completed and the results iucorpomted i u the tide table::; for 1889. 8. The harmonic reductions f()r New Loud011, Co1111., \\~ashington, D. C., and Key \Vest, Fla., hegn11 last year, lmn1 been fini~hed, the work n·qnircd aggregating about the s:tme as the reduction of one ye:tr of ohscr\'at,iom;. A ycry full re1lnction, iuclmliug :1 harmonic reduction, of one year's observations at St. Paul, Kadiak Island, .\l:tska, has heeu about two-thirds completed. Upon this re<ludiou will be based preilictious for Kadiak lsl:tml for 1890 as an additional principal station on our wcstPr11 coast. !l. Nou-lrnrmonic reductions IHWP bce11 m:ttle oft1hort series at one huudroll and thirty-four sta· tions, 1tggrngati11g about ten yearn of continuous oh.~errntious. This iuclu<les stations ou various parts of the Atlantic and Pacific coastis. A\Jont half of them are on the coast of Maine, where the work has been begun of reducing all tidal ohsen·at,ions 011 the Atlantic coast and making a complete Hhowiug ol result,; i11 fot'Itl to be immediately arnilable. 'l'he character of the tid:1l work it1 such, and such arc the circumstances of its performance, that a detailed statement of the work done by each clerk during the year would lie too voluminous an affair to be of unn:h value, antl would require for its production a constant antl serious Lliversion of our atteution from ticles to statistics. In tile preparation of tide notes, descriptions of bench-marks with a statement of tlleir relation to the plane of reference, and otller tidal data, in response to re<1nisitious, the rule is to produce the data as promptly as is practicable. To this eud several clerks will be emJJloyed upon tho stuno requisition; for example, one making a thorough sea,rch aud bringiug together all avaihtble data and re,·ising results, one or two reducing observations, another making the necessary copies of sb]tclies and verbal descriptions, etc. Nor do the exigencies of the work admit of our always adhering to a fixed order of procedure, or invariably distributing the same part of tbe work to the same clerk. And like remarks apply with more or less force to every description of the work of this Di,·ision. An attempt has been made in the daily reports, rendered monthly, to afford means for judging of the eilicicncy of the indiYidnal clerks b.Y a statement of the class of work upon which each was emploJ·ed, and, since there is no means of measuring its quantity and stating it in uuiti>, a description b_y station and date bas there been giYen, by means of which it may be fotrnd and subjected to the inspection of au expert. To thoso reports 1 heg lea,·e to refer for detailed and more specific statement. 'l'he following is a statement of the general character of the work of each clerk: Mr. L. P. Shidy has been engaged upon almost ever.Y description of our work, upon the higher parts of the harmonic reductiouiS, the non-harmonic reductions, their comparison and revision, the preparation of tide notes antl other tidal data, the differencing of the tide tables, reading of proof, etc. I depend largely upon Mr. Shidy for the elimination of errors from the work of the other clerks and the orderly arrangement of results. Mr. J. W. Whitaker made the major part of the predictions with the machine for 1889 and assisted iu nearly every other kind of work. I am glad to be ahle to report that be bas made some progress in usefulness during the year. l\Jis.s A. G. Reville has read proofs, copied sketches, descriptfons, and reductions, read mare· grams, made a graphical anal~·sis of the tide at St. Paul, Kadiak Island, Alaska, by the method of' Pourtales, predicted with the machine for Smith,·ille, Charleston, Savannah, and Fernandina, for 1889, and during the latter part of the year lrns assisted in examining and registering the tidal records received. Miss Reville has performed all duties dernlvetl upon her with characteristic faithfulness, and has steadily progresse<l in usefulness t,o this Di\·ision. 1 think it wot1ld be only just to increase her compeusatiou from $i20 to $840 per annum. Mrs.1\1. E. Nesbitt predictell from curn~s for Baltimore and Washinooton and for Philad.el· pbia in duplicate, for 1889, difforenced the tide tables for 1889, read proof, ;ork~ on the harmonic reductions for Washington, Key West, and Kadiak Island, made non-harmonic reductions for some fifty stations, and computed on the Sandy Hook half-tide level. Mrs. Nesbitt is almost oontinll·

Turnbull ruled forms, copied sketches and descriptions, copied aud compared predictions for 1889, predicted from curves for Baltimore and \Va8hingto11 for 1889, and assisted 6.11 the harmonic reduction for Kadiak Island. Miss Turnbull wa.s tram;ferred from this Divisiou March I. Miss F. Uadel was attached to thi8 Di\'ision July 1 to 6, and again from October;> to January 4, and was employed mling forrm1, copsing, reading maregrrtms, registeriug tidal records received, and summing component M for Kadiak Island. Mrs. Virginia Harrison was attachecl to this Division Jannars 5, and has been employed dilferenciug- the tide t1tbles, reacliug proof, computing half-tide lernl Sandy Ilook, workiug on the harmonic reduction for Kadiak Island, and in makiug non-llarmonic reduct10us. Miss Glova B. Bower, attached to this Division February 1 to April '.!4, was emvloyed copyiug, ruling forms, reading proof, and maregrams. 1\Ir. S. B.

Brandon was nmler instruction in this DiYision, preparatory to taking charge of the Sandy Ilook tidal station, from May :..l3 to ,Juue 35, when he proceeded to Sandy Hook. The charge of this Di\'ision was contiune1l with the undersigned tllroughout the year. The distribution of the work, supen·ision of its performance, with much minute direction to beginners, revision of results, preparation of data for charts, the Coast Pilot, field partie8, and parties not connected with the Survey, the preparation of the tide tables, and elimination of errors from· them while going through tlie press, the examination of tidal records receiYed, and preparation of' correspoudence, have left me very little official time for anything else. Chiefly in non official time I have investigated the \Vest .Florida, Uat Island, and Biloxi, and Puget Sound titles, the mean establishment and range at San Francisco and Astoria, increasing the establishment at A.Atoria by 23m; and I have verified Prof. C. H. Darwin's report of 1883 on the llarmonic A.11alyt:1is of the Tides, and taken steps, including the computation of fuwlamental ta.oles, to free the Survey n~tluctions and predictions from some rather serious errors with which tlwy are afl:ected. Yours, respectfully, ALEX. S. UIIIUSTIE, Chief of Tidal JJii·ision. Mr. B. A. COLONNA, Assista1it in charge of Office and Topography.

REPORT OF THE MISCELLANEOUS DIVISJON, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1888.

DEA& Sm: I have the honor to submit herewith the usual report of the Miscellaneous DiYision for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1888. The organization of the Division remained the same as it bad been in the preceding year until the 16th of December, 1887. On that date the Chart Division was establi8hed, and to it were transferred all the duties and responsibilities pertaining to the correcting, custody, and issue of charts. The establishment of this new Division, which had long been the subject of consideration, has already been justified by experience; and it is confidently believed that time will confirm the wisdom ot' the action taken in this behalf. The work of the Miscellaneous Division now includes the correspondence with Sale Agents in relation to the supply and sale of publications and keeping the accounts connected with the s~ime; the purchase, custody, and issue of stationery, the printing and h~sue of the Annual Reports and other publications of the Survey, and of the record books, blank forms, etc., used in the business of the office and in the field-work; the purchase of the miscellaneous supplies, the supervision of the office lmildings, and such special duties as are assigned from time to time. The following new publications were issned during the year: Tide Tables for the Atlantic Coast for 1888; Tide '!'ables for the Pacific Coast for 1888; Subdivision 21, Atlantic Local Coast

New editions of the "IJaws arnl I~egulatiom; relating to the Coast and Geodetic Surve~-,'' and of the '; Oatalog11e of Charts and other Publieations, '' were also published tlnring the year. 'l'he Annual Iteports of the Survey, the appendice:; to the Aame in pamphlet form, the Notices to l'lfariners, aud Bulletins, were distributed as usual to tlie Executive Departments, Senators, and Uepreseutati ves, rnstitntions, and inrli vidnals. Special efforts were made to distribute the Catalogue of Charts as widely as possible amongst captains of vessels and others intcresteJ in Iia\·igation, and it is lJelim·cd that.the largely increased demand for cliarts is chiefly owing to these efforts. It is impossible to tabulate a large proportion of the work of this Division, and no tabulation whatever can he made that will convey mnclt idea of the nmouut of labor involved in the transaction of its business. The followiu g statement, howevrr, Hhows the ,·olume of tlic work:

In the fiscal yearenderl June 30, 188i, there were deposited with sale agents twenty-one thousand and ten copies of cliarts. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1888, twenty-five thousitnd two 11'\mdred aud seventy-three charts were sent to agents, being an increase of four thousand two hundred and sixty-three copies, and by far the largest number ever issued in any one year on that account m the history of the Survey. Six new sale agencies were established during the year, four on the Atlantic Coast and two on the Pacific Coast. The total number of agencies on June 30, 1888, was seventy-one, viz, fifty-eight on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, and thirteen on the Pacific Coast. The following table shows the aggregate of business done through the sale agencies during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1888:

Mr. Freeman H. Green has continued to keep tl1e accounts of the sale agents, and has performed various clerical duties in addition. Mr. Green's performance of his duties has been highly satisfactory and richly deserves substantial recognition. Mr. Ba,ssett has been in charge of th., Map-mounting l{oorn, where the work has been of the same character as in preceding years. On the 2d of July, 1887, :\Ir. A. D.

Prom what precedes it will be seen that there have been registered in the Archives during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1888, 619 volumes and 1 package of geodetic observations; 224 cahiers of geodetic computations; 26 cahiers of descriptive reports on topographic sheets; 92 volumes and 37 cahiers of astronomical observations and computations; 64 chronograph sheets; 4 volumes, 'l3 cahiers, and 60 sheets of magnetic observations; 1,110 sheets of magnetic traces; 11 cahiers and 80 sheets of magnetic computations; 27 volumes of pendulum observations; 133 chronograph i-heets; 2 volumes and 1 cahier of meteorological observations; 917 volumes and 23 ca.biers of h,ydrogrnphic observations; 1 roll of hydrograpbic observations; 447 bottles of !lpecimens of seabottom, and 88 tide rolls; 13 cahiers of descriptive reports on h;ydrographic sheets; 5!) completed topographic sheets; 74 completed hydrographic sheets. There has been no binding of records or computations done this fiscal year, although there are a great number that should be bound for their better preservation, convenience of reference, and to give needed room. The soundings and tidal obser\·ations ought also to be bound, as they would then occupy much less space than in their present condition, and room will soon be needed. During the past ftscal year there have been received in the Library 201 bound volumes, 96 unbound vol um~ and 168 pamphlets, besides a number of periodicals and publications of scientific societies. Thirty-one volmnes have been 1mbstantially bound at the Government Bindery. Most of these were rebound, the original binding being in a bad state. One hundred and twenty-eight other volumes were sent to the Bindery for binding, but they were not returned to the Library till after June 30, 1888. There are still quite a numher of volumes that need rebinding, and many m1bound works that should be bound. Mr.·J. M. Duesberry has he,en employed in this Division as clerk daring this fiscal year. Mr. Joseph Fuqua was employed in the Library on the card catalogue from l\lay 11, 1888, to l\l ay 19, 1888, and from June 4, 1888, to June 12, 18~8. Miss Florence Carlisle was employed in the Library on the card catalogue from May 28, 1888, to June ;)O, 1888. Mr. Atlee Johnson was emplo~·ed a few days from ~lay 2R, 1888, sorting books in the fourth story of the Butler Building, and in bringing the same down and imtting them ou the tops of the cases in the Library. The card catalogue is nearly finished. Yours, respectfully, ARTEMAS MARTIN, Librat·ian and Custodian of Archives. Mr. B. A. COLONNA, Assistant in charge of Office.

REPORT OF l'HE ACCOUNTING DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, FOR THE FISCAL. YEAR ENI>INO JUNE 30, 18&l.

ACCOUNTING DIVISION,

U. 8. COAST AND

GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, November 15, 1888. Sm: I ba.Y"e the honor to submit herewith the report of the operations of the Accounting
. Division for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1888. The work of the Division is so varied iu its character that a complete report can 11ot be made without a reference to those salient events occur· ring during the year which were liable, to a greater or less extent, to affect its operations, and to increase or diminish its efficiency. These will, therefore, be alluded to in the course of the report. Oommenoing July 1, 1887, a system of making semi-monthly trial balances and monthly balance-sheets, showing in detail the receipts and expenditures of the Survey under the appropriations made by Congress, was inangnra.ted, and bas since been adhered to with much success and great satisfaction to all concerned. These bala.noo-sheets are made in triplicate-one each for the Sec-

144

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

retary of the Treasury, the Superintendent, and the Disbursing Officer-and they afford a convenient method for readily >eri(ying the financial condition of the Survey, and serve as a check against errors. Their preparation is now mandatory under the Hcgt1lations. On Jnly 25, lti87, a special committee, composed of Messrs. Spear and Myers, of the First Comptroller's office, appointed by the Secretary of the Treasnrr, made a personal investigation and examination of the accounts and records of the Dh-ision, and on the following day officially reported to the Department that the accounts of the Survey were found correct and in exact balance. :Eivery facility and courtesy was extended to the committee, and the result, so promptly reached, was a desernid tribute to the efficacy of the "balance-sheet" system so auspiciously begun on tl.te first of the mouth, the labors of the eommittee consisting simply in checking off the amounts given on the balance-sheet and proYing their correctness. As a consistent step towards the organization of the methods of work in the Di>ision, the following-named new forms aud blanks were prepared during the months of October and November, 1887, and received the appro\-al of the Superintendent for adoption and printing: Fieltl estimates for chiefs of parties (ameutled), balance sheet blanks for Office, Office payrolhi, cash receipts aud expenditures, annual statement book for fiscal year, letter returning prop· erty lists, letter authorizing advances, letter for adjusting accounts, letter transmitting advances, letter for stating balances on accoullts, letter for transmitting checks. 1'he use of these new forms and recordR has aided most materially i11 lessening clerical labor, and affords a more complete aud satisfactory record of work aceomplhshed. During .Tnly arnl August, 1887, a series of salary tables, comprising all the new rates per annum (twenty-three in all) estahlishNl for the seri;ice by tlie 8u1Hlry Ci i:il Act, approved March 3, 1887 (in addition to thoRe already gi>en in the Government salary tables), were computed in this Divb;ion, upon the basis of the regular tables, arnl these computations were afterwards verified by the Computing Dh·isiou. 'l'Lesc new tables have been found of very great convenience in check· ing the 1iay-roll aml salary account.~, as the use of them avoids the laborious process of combining two or more of the old tahles together in ordt·r to arrive at one rate. The new edition of the Hegulatious (1887) was proof-read and indexed by me during the early imrt of .August, 1887. A recommendation that a number of copies of the new edition be interleaved and rebouml, for convenience in making notes or criticisms from time to time, such as the future enforcement of the Hegulatiom; would uo doubt suggest, was concurred in by the Superinten1lent. The annual Heport of Expenditures of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year endiug Juue 30, 1887, was completed and transmitted to Congress on :February 11, 1888. The delay iu the final completion of this rPport wa;; unavoida,ble, and owing to circumstances entirely beyond my control. It ;;l10uld have been presented to Congress during the month of December, and the failure to do so occasio11etl me much regret. The almost continual disallowancn Ll.Y the accounting ofticers in the accounts of the Survey of alleged overcharges on fees paid for jurats iuduced me to make efforts to :;ecure information upon whieh to formulate a list of the legal rates for uotarial foes in the different States. The files of the Comptroller':; and .Auditor's ofiices, the Bmean of l1a.lmr, a.1Hl the Congressional Library were examined, and from the data olJtaim><l, a list, believecl to IJe fairly correct, was compiled. This list lms been distributed among the ehiefs of the intrties of the Sun·e~-, with the suggestion that further ad vices u1lon the snl\jPct would he th:tukfully receivetl b,y this Office. In time, it is hoped tliat a perfectly correct list may be obtained, through tho kind co-operation of the :Field Officers. Hnring the year, for a period of forty.four days, my services were calle(l inoo requisition by the f<'irst Comptroller of tho Treasury, to aid in the final examination and adjustment of the accouuts of Mr. William B. l\forgan, late Disbursing Agent. This detail was no doubt proper and necessary, but the loss of time from my own legitimate duties in the Accounting Division was a source of much embarrassment and oecasionetl much delay in the transaction of current business. From .May l!) to June 9, 1888, I was engaged, under instructions from the Superintendent, in tra11sforri1~g the Unit:d States schooner Spy from New York, N. Y., to Washington, D. C. Oompl!·t~' details as t'.> this duty, and the manner in which it was aiccomplisbe<l, have boon made the snhJt>Ct of a special report to the Superintendent.

TiNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

145

The current work of the Division during the fiscal year has been adjusted with a degree of promptitude heretofore unknown in the history of the Accounting Division. But few instances of delay in the settlement of accounts have occurred, and these were mainly owing to my enforced absence on duty at the Department. Duriug the first six months of the fiscal year the force a,ttached to the Accounting Division was also quite inadequate to the demands made upon it, and but for the detail of another ernploye therein early in January, 18&~, the current work would have fallen greatly iu arrears. Some delay must necessarily result under our present syst~m of making disbursements, but it has alwa,ys been my earnest effort to neutralize this as much as possible hy giving extr,i time t-0 the business of tlie Divisiou. The Quarterly accounts of the Surve_y have been renderer! to the Auditor more promptly during the last fiscal year than has been the case for several years past. This gain is quite gratifying, uuder the circumstances. · Ia my last .Annual l:,eport, and also in the Monthly Report for September, 1887, I ham called attention to the necessity for some arrangement by which a greater degn·c of prinwy and consequent freedom from interruption could be secured for the employes of this Division. A counter, surmounted by the usual screen-work, sl10uld be erected iu tho rooms of the Accounting DiYision at a8 early a date as may be practicable. I again renew my former recommendations to this efi'Mt. Such action would be in the line of a sound business policy, and would contribute largely to the essential features of accuracy and rapidity in the transaction of the current business of the Division. It is almost impossible to give intelligible statistics for work such as that accomplished in this Division. The nearest approach is to stat~ its volume. The mere examination of the number of accouut8 adjusted, letters written, etc., affords but a slight conception of the innumerable details to which attention has to be given. The statistics which follow, therefore, while the best that can be stated, are not to be considered by any means as covering every feature of the work: l'#atistics. 1;39 Abstracts, quarterly, of disbursements, pages of. .................... . .Accounts, with United States, opened, number of .................... . 16 .Accounts, allotments, opened, number of ...........................· 144 Accounts, subappropriations, opened, number of ..................... . 74 .Accounts, Pacific railroads, referred, number of ..................... . 37 l,882 .Accounts, entered on quarterly abstracts, number of ................ .

The total numl>er of working days during- the year 011 which the Office was open for the trans· aetion of hu:-;iuess was :Jo.q. 'l'l.te arrangement of the work of the Division among its employee has been about as follows: Mr. Eugene B. l\lills, accountant, has been engaged in the examination of accounts, checking them aH to errors of ennmeration, extension, etc., iu drawing- checks at the Department, and mailing the conet<}10111lence of the Di,·ision. He deserves credit for close application to bis work. Mr.\\'. IL Lamnan, general hook-keeper, was assigned to duty iu the Division on January 9, 1888, h~· trnusfer from the II~·drogmpbic Inspector's Office. His experience of nearly two years in the otlice of the dishursiug cl<.'rk of the 1'reasury Dqmrtment, prior to his employment in the Survey, ha.-, made l1im a Yalnahle addition to the force of the Division. His work is mainly dependent upon my own, and its execution has g-i\'en me much satiRfaction. ::Hrs. S. ~I. 'l'aliaferro, book- keeper and entry clerk, has been engaged mainly in entering aml posting Yonchers, etc., to the y;irious account books of the Division, in the compilation of the Quarterly Abstracts, and general miscellaneous work . .Miss Paula E. Sruith, general clerk, has had charge of the preparation of the semi-monthly and monthly pay-rolls and the letter files, and has rendered intelligeut and capable service in the execution of innumerable details of the work. The experience of another year has con\·inced me more than ever that the Survey should pos· sess its own Disbursing Officer. The 1>resent arrangement for making disbursments is at once both cumbersome and annoying, produces delay in settlements, and by comparison of results will be found much more expensive tban almost any other method we could adopt. It is the outcome of

tbe peculiar couditious which existed in the Survey some three years since, conditions which no lunger exist, aml it should uow ue abandoned in tbe iutermsts of sound puulic economy. Comparisons can be readily made to prove the costl~ness of the present system. The work of the Division is constantly increasing in volume, and the time now lost in communicating with the Department aud iii the preparation.of papers essential to a proper record under the present system could be sa\'ell by tlrn appointment of a Disbursing Clerk for the Sun'ey au<l gi,·en to the current business of the Office. In this connectiou, I beg to refer yon to the views expressecl by me upou tl.Jis subject in my annual report for the fiscal year ending .June 30, 1887. l\ir. George A. Bartlett, Disbursing Ulerk of the Treasury Department, has displayed his usual interest in making the disbursements for the Survey. The business of the Divisiou has, as heretofore, beeu conducted in his name, and in all matters pertaining to the adjustment of his accounts by the accounting officers of the Treasur_v he necessarily assumes full responsibility. The ouvious propriety of compensating Mr. Bartlett for this responsibility can not be queistioned. l\Iy views upon this matter are more fully expressed in the report of the Di \'iision for tlte fiscal year 1886-'87.

BUREAU O:F WEIGHTS AND :MEASURES,

SFRVlff OFFICE, TVaxkington, July 19, 1&"8. Srn: I beg leave t-0 submit this report on the work of the Weights and Measures Division under my charge since October 7, 1887: The letter of instructions from the Superintendent assigning me to this duty directed me to prepare for publication the Weights and Measures report, compiled chietly by the late assistant, II. W. Blair, under the direction of Prof. J.E. Hilgard, then Superintendent, but not subjected to the latter's final revision. Upon perusal of the manuscript I found it necessary to index the records of tlle Weights and Measures Office. The time occupied in tho completion of this preliminary work and the current work of the Office has prevented me from putting the report into final shape for the printer. The laborious work of classifying, cataloguing, and indexing the papers of this Office accumulated since 1844 was performed by Sub-Assist.ant F. H. Parsons with care and good jmlgment while attached to this Division from No\·ember 23 to May 10. The records and correspondence np to the time of my assuming charge are now bound and on file in the Archives. Dr. J, J. Clark, adjuster, whose long experience and knowledge of details freely rendered assisted me materially, ma.de all the weighings and assisted in the comparisons of standards, in calibmting a thermometer and in other work. He also prepared the weights and measures exhibit for the Cincinnati Centennial Exhibition. Assistant J.B. Weir was attached to this Division during the months of March and April and again during June. He was engaged in making and revising computations of work done nuder my direction and previously. He also assisted in the comparison of standards. The principal results of the work done on the standards will be given elsewhere, but a bl'ief account may not be-0ut of place here. The Arago kilogramme sent to England in 1879, and weighed at the Standards Office in that year against the English Standard Kilogramme, was taken to the International Bureau in 1884and weighed a.ga.inst the International Standard. Since then the English Kilogramme has also been compared

with the International and the outstanding <lifl:'ere11ce formell by the equations thus established is less than 0.1 milligrarnme. The Arago Kilogramme was also weighed under my direction "With the gilt Silbermann Kilogl'amme an<l with the brass Star Kilogramme of this Office, and it appears that while the relation of the Arago (platinum) Kilogramme to tlie Silhermann (gilded brass) bas not changed sensibly since 1873, the Star (brass) Kilogramme has not preserved its weight as perfectly, ha\-iug gained more by oxidation than it has lost. by abrasion. T!Jis is in accordance with pre\ious experience. It was in vimr of this fact that I requested ~·ou to authorize the Electrot.vping Division t-0 make experiwcnts on gilding weights of the composition (Hassler brass) used in this Office as working stamlarus. A necessary comparison was also made by me between the two British standard Yards, Iron No. 57 and Bronze No. 11. An account of the comparison of these two yards with each other and of No. 11 with the Imperial standard was published in Appendix 12, Report for 1876; since then, for reasons stated in that appendix, No. 57 was sent abroad and was compared in London with the Imperial Stamlard; it was returned to this Office in 1884, but no comparison was made after its nitum hetwee11 it·aud No. 11 until the recent one made by me. The result of these subsequent comparisons lms shown the correctness of the lengths assigned to Bronze No. 11 and Iron No. 57 in A p1iernlix 12, He port for 1876, above quoted. Though the courtesy of Prof. Henry l\forton, President of the Stevens Institute of Technology, a Hassler brass bar, belonging to the Institute, which bad been compared at the International Bureau with its standard was loaned to this Office and was compared with its fellow Yard and Metre No. 1, at the prevailing temperature of the comparing room. Berlin Metre No. 49, largely used in pendulum work, was then compareu with Yard an<l l\lctre No. 1, and thus related to the Interna· tional ::\ktrc. Ilithcrto No. ,1() has been referred to the luteruational Standard through the compariso11;; of Profof'sor Foerster at Berlin. The two Yalucs thus obtained arc not strictly comparable because the co ellicient of expansion of Yard aml Metre ~o. 1 is not accurately known, and although it can [)(l dcriwd from fmther comparisons, at a lower temperature, with No. 49 they will have to ht\ lleforn·<l until fall when the temperature of the comparing room is lower. The urgent necessity for a room whose temperature cau be artificially eontrollc<l is well known to you, but is again made appareut hy these facts. The compari;;o11s made wit!J Metre No. 49 show that the latter is not well adapted to its original pm·11ose, that of serdng as a staJHlanl of' refon)llet', because the <lefi11i11g lines am of irregular wi<Ith :uul too crntr;;e anll lleep to meet lllotlern requirements. The effect of the illumination on tht> appearance of t!Jese liues was brought out iucide11tally b,r the comparisons recently made in wliich the conditions were so varied as to show this source of error. Iu this counectiou it s!Jonld be mentioned that the Tolles illuminating prisms in the microscopes ham 11ot, as at present arranged, given satisfaction and recourse was again had to the old form of an extemal retlect1Jr under the ol~jective. The microscopes of the comparator have been supplie1l with levels arnl thHir mounting has been changed. A set of comparisons was made to test whethel' the beam coznpasH nlicroscopes of tlie comparator maintain their relative position when the beam compass cnrryiug them i8 moved to and fro. The comparhmns so far made indicate that the clfoct is very slight. In the way of experiment the direct comparison between two end measures and betweeu a line autl end measure was marle 011 tlrn comparator in the same way as the comparisons between two line me:tsnres ar(! made, witll satisfactory results. This method is a motlification of that. of Fizeau, aud a'\ far as known to me has not boon prac· ticetl before. The e11<1 bars are preparecl for comparison by stretching a spider thread across the <tbutt.ing ~nrf.'lccR. Tbc direct am! rnllected images of the threads are seen separated by a line of light from two to five microns wille, on which the pointings are made. In conclusion I append au abstract of information famished by this Division. Yours respectfullJ, 0. H. TlT'rMANN, Assista1it, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Sur'Cey. Mr. B. A.

No. 5.-1888.

REPORT OF THE HYDROGRAPHIC INSPECTOR FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1888.
U. S.
COAB1' AND GEODE'I'IC SURVEY OFFICE,

Wasltington, U. ()., Oetobe1· 31, 1888. SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report on the hydrogrnphic work under my charge, and 011 the condition of the vesseh1 of the Sarvey, and the repairs made to them duriug the fiscal year ending June 30, 1888.
HYDROGRAPHY-COAST OF MAINE.

The beginning of the fiscal year found the steamer Ged1iey, Lieut. F. H. Crosby, U. S. N., commanding, on the coast of Maine, the party having arrived on tlle working ground on June 11. Lieutenant Crosby closed work on the 19th of October, liaYing in the mean time finished tlle bydrography of Passamaquoddy Bay from Eastport to the mouth of St. Croix River-the sun·ey of the St. Croix Hiver from its month to Calais-anrl Rheet No. 1 of Cobscook Btty. In addition to the regular work on the coast of Maine, Lieutenant Crosby made examinations in Penobscot Hiver and in the vicinity of Machias Seal Islands. The Gedne!f returned to New York fate in October and was immediately put in condition for further service in the Gulf.
VINEY ARD SOUND.

The schooner Eagre, Lieut. C. P. Perkins, U.S. N., commanding, having been engaged in Long Island Sound on current work and in making examinations and developing shoal spots, moYed to Vineyard Sound a few days before the beginning of the fiscal year. The party was a large one and hacl attached to it, in addition to the Eag1·e, the steamer Daisy, three large steam.launches, and a small Herreshoff launch. This obviated the necessity for delay in case of the breaking down of one of the boats. The work of the party in the Eagre was principally confined to Vineyard Sound, extending out as far as No Man's Land, which is rather beyond the limits to which steam-launch parties should work. This was shown on one occasion when a gale of wind coming up suddenly, the Daisy started to convoy and tow the Herreshoff launch back to a secure anchorage inshore, but unfortunately the launch foundered on the way in. The steamer Backe, Lieut. J. F. Moser, U. S. N., commanding, arrived in Vineyard Sound at the beginning uf the year, and was very successful in extending the hydrography from Block ·Island to Martha's Vineyard. The usual delays and interruptions were occasioned by fogs and bad weather, but notwithstanding this the progress was very rapid. The Backe closed work on the 4th of November and proceeded to Baltimore to refit for work ou the coast of Florida. The Eagre closed work on the 5th of November and proceeded to New York, at which place :~Uthe officers were detached with the exception of the chief of the party, who remained with the recorder to get the records in shape for sending to the office. Daring the winter the party on board the .Eagre made special examinations near Lawrence Point, East River, and at New York entrance. Lieutenant Perkins was detached from the Survey February 28, 1888, and was succeeded in command of the Eagre by Lieut. Sumner C. Paine, U. S. N.

lTNITEI> STATJ<}S COAST AND GEODETIU

SURVJ~Y.

Tbe Eagre left New York in May, 1888, to proceed to the eastward and continued thf: rn1mrvey of Vineyard Sound. Lieutenant Paine was directed to stop at Stouiugton, Conn., and urnke a Hpecial examination of Noyes's Shoal off the entrance to Stonington Harbor. Upon the completion of this service the rt>gular work of tlle part~· in Viuc,yanl Sound was taken up ancl was in progress at tile close of the fi~cal year. 'fhc 1wcessit,y of the r<'1mrn1y of Vim\nml Sound is sl1own hy the great changes that have been dcniloped in various places, this beillg <'specially marked near the eastern limits. For instance, a report of the grounding of the i:;teamer Orion 011 a shoal to the eastward of Great Uouud shoal having been received through the Brauch II~·drographic Office at Bostou, the commamling oJlicer of the Gedney was directed to make an examination at as early a date as prac· tica!Jle. A shmtl was dcYcloped wit!.t least depth of fifteen feet of water wllere the former survey gave o\'IW seven fatllorus, and tllis well outside of all the numerous shoals whicl1 lie between Nantucket and l\fouoruoy. Many such chaugcs have ueen developed in the iirogress of tl1is important work.
SEA-COAST IIYDROGRAPUY AND CURRENTS.

The steamer Blake, Lieut. J.E. Pillsbury, U.S. N., commanding, was engaged from July to November making off.shore somulings from l\lontauk l'oint to Phelps's Bank, and in making current obserYatious tixtcnding from a iiosition to the southward of Nantucket to the coast of New Jerse~·. 'fhese obserYations added materially to the information in the office in regard to the set of the current in this important locality. l\Iuch, however, remains to be done in investigations regarding inshore currents aloug our coast.
CHESAPEAKE BAY-VICINITY OF CAPE CIIARLES.

Owing to the reported changes in the extensiw; shoal grounds in the vicinity of Cape Charles on the northern side of the entrance to Chesapeake Hay, it was deemed advisable to make a resun·ey of the locality. Thii:; duty was assigue<l to Lieut. M. L. Wood, L. S. N., assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, who was directed in April, 1888, to assume command of the steamer En· dea1wr, then at New York, and organize a hydrographic p:irty on board that vessel. The Endeavor left New York April 21, and upon arriYal at the working grouud the resurvey was begun at once, and was prosecuted vigorousl.r, though much retal'de<l by nJry unfavorable weather. This work was still in progress at the close of the fo;cal year.
NORTH CAROLrnA SOUNDS.

The party on board the schooner Scoresby, Lieut. Francis Winslow, U. S. N., commanding, was engaged throughout the year upon works connected with an examination of the oyster-beds of the sounds of North <.::arolina.
ST. SillON'S SOUND, GEORGIA.

The bar obstructing the entrance to St. Simon's Sound, Georgia, is of a shifting character, and the results of surveys of it can not be depencled upon for an~· lcni,,rth of timfl. The growing commercial interests of the port of Brunswick, Ga., approached through St. Simon's Sound, render it desirable, however, that the bar Le examined occasionally. Accordingly the party on board the Blake made a resurvey of this bar in M:ay, 18&'), and the results obtained, which show marked changes, are now indicat-0d on the charts.
WEST COAST OF FLORIDA.

The steamer Bache, Lieut.·r. F. Moser, U. S. N., commanding, having refitted at Baltimore, sailml January 3, 1888, for the Gu~f of Mexico, where the hydrographic work on the west ooat1t of Florida was carried on by this party until May 10. T11e results show a most gratifying success achieved ih the face of many adverse conditions. At the end of the fiscal year the Bache, having refitted at New Bedford, Mass., had begnu work in the vicinity of Martha's Vineyard.

U.ISITED STATES OOAST AND GEODETIO SUH.VEY.
COAST OF LOUISI.ANA.

153

The steamer Gedney, Lieut. F. Il. Crosby, U. S. N., commanding, left New York .January 3, 1888, under instruction~ to continue unfinished hydrograpby on the coast of Louisiana, and was engaged in this ~ork until June 1. During the greater portion of the season, progress was much ·,retarded hy unfavorable weather. On the way south in January, 1888, an examination of a reported shoal was made off New Inlet, Florida.
HYDROGRAPHY-PACIFIC COAST (COASTS OF OREGON AND W.A.SIIINGTON TERRITORY).

The steamer 1llcArthur, Lieut. J. C. Burnett, U. s. N., commanding, has been engaged in hydrographic work on the coasts of Oregon and Washington Territory. On September 18, 1887, a whale-boat was capsized while in Shoalwater Uay, Washington Territory, while away from the vessel on duty, resulting in the death of Ensign N. S. Mosely, U.S. N., in charge of the boat. A special report of this distressing occurrence was made at the time. "\<Vork was closed in October, 1887, and resumeu in April following. This party was still on the working ground at the close of the fiscal year. The prevalence or thick fogs has been a great drawback in the work.
PUGET SOUND AND ADJACENT WATERS.

The schooner Earnest has been emflloyed in the survey of the northern waters of Washington Territory. Work for the season of 1887 was closed October 2cl. Lieut. C. T. Forse, U.S. N., was in command until December 10, 1887, and upon his detachment was succeeded by Lieut. H. T. Mayo, U. S. N. Work was resumed in April, 1888, and was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.
ALASKA EXPLORATIONS,

The steamer PattersQn, Lieut. Commander 0. M. Thomas, U. S. N., commanding, having been thoroughly refitted, left San l!'rancisco for Alaska on the 9th of April, 1888, to carry on the regular work of the Survey in Stephan's Sound and l<'rederick Passage. In July it became necessary to discontinue this work to take up that of Portland Canal and Pearse's Channel, a survey of this locality having been requested by the Department of State. Lieutenant CommanderThomas was instructed to push this as rapidly as was consistent with accuracy, and to complete it before the end of the seaRon. The reports of this work are most gratifying, showing great skill and energy on the part of the chief of party and his assistants. In addition to the above mentioned work the following hydrography bas been executed by the field officers of the Survey in connection witb. topography, and turned in for verification: Off Nausett Beach, M.assoohusetts, by Assistant H. L. Marindin, Coast and Geodetic Survey. Inside waters of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, by Assistant D. B. Wainwright, Coast and Geodetic Survey. Mobile River, Alabama, by Subassistant J. Henry Turner, Coast and Geodetic Survey. Atchafalaya River, Louisiana, by Assistant C. B. Sinclair, Coast and Geodetic Surrny. San Juan, Capistrano Bay, California, Ferdinand Westdabl. Eel River, California, Ferdinand Westdahl. Examination of Newport Bay and San Pedro Bay, Ferdinand West<lahl. In the three last named cases the work was executed under the general direction of Prof. George Davidson, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey.
DEEP SE.A. SOUNDINGS .A.ND OCEAN CURRENTS.

The plan submitted by Lieut. J.E. Pillsbury, U. S. N., for his winter's work having been approved by you, the Blake, under bis command, started south on the 28th of December, 1887, for the purpose of gauging the currents which enter the Caribbean Sea. During the winter he occupied stations in &11 the channels between the Windward Islands and extending as far to the westward as Cuba. His very interesting report is already in your possession. The work on wbich

Lieutenant Pillsbury is engaged is of iuterest not only to the seienfa1t btit of the greatest valut:1 to the navigator. It is the most praetical and thorough attempt to investigate ocean currents that has ever been made, and the results are most grati(ying.
ALASKA COAST PILOT.

The amount of new data available co11cerniug the coast of Alaska rendered the rewriting of the Ala:ska Coast Pilot desirable, and iu compliauce with my recommernlation to that effect this work was, iu November, 1887, placed in the bands of Lieut. Commander H. E. Nichols, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geo1letic Survey, whose service iu Alaskan waters rendered him peculiarly well fitted for this important m;sigumm1t. Lieuteuant-Commauder Nichols ha8 been engaged upon this dut_y throughout the remaining portion of the fiscal ~-ear. Earl,Y in the spring of 1888 he visited Alaska in connection with the work, and was still colledrng tlat;1 in that lom1lity at the close of the fiscal ,Year. Ile has since retnrued to San Francisco an<l has imbmitted an interesting report of his season's work.
COAST PILOT DIVJSION.

The Coast Pilot DiYision has con tinned under the immediate supervh5io11 of Lieut. George H. Peters, U. 8. N., Assistant Coast and Beodetic Snrrny, whose annual re.port is submitted herewith. Lieutenant Peters has immedial<> charge of the Coast Pilot work of the Survey on tbe Atlantic coast aud his duties afloat require him to be ab,;eut from th~ office from time to time. Dnriug such periods Ensign K H. Tillman, U. 8. N ., ha" been in charge of the office work of this Division. Altho~1gh the fmce available for compiling Coast Pilot matter, etc., has been materially affected by detachment, and b,v assignment to other duties, yet there has been no time wl1en the printer has not h.nl i11 hand the ma11uscript of one or more ,-olumes, and other manuscript has been prepared and is ready to I e put in type when practicable. \Vork has been in progre.~s on a large volume, de.~igncd to cover the Atlantic Coast of the United States. As 8tatcd i11 tlw annual n·port of last year, the plau followed in the work it,i iu conformity with the method of treatment propo:,ied by lJieutenaut Peters. In consideration of the time rt>quired to issue the entire work in printe1l form, it has been deemed mh·isable to prepare and have printed separately such parts of the new work a;i cover portions of the coast for which a publication of tllis natnre is in most tlcnrnrnl. \Vith this in view, the manuscript of the new work covering the coast from Point ,Judith to the B<ist Hivcr inclusive has been sent to the printer, to be issued in one part or Yolume. ·
IIYDJWGRA.I'HIC DIVISION.

This Dh·i,.ion was in charge of Lieut. 1\1. L. Wood, U. S. N., from the beginning of the fiscal year until April 17, 1888. Ou the latter date J,ieutenant \Yood was temporarily detached from tht~ office and ordered to command the steamer Enrlenror. Duriug the absence of Lieutenant \Vood, Lieutenant Peters assumed charge of the Division iu addition to his own work, and on the latter's detachment in May for field duty, all this work de\·olvetl upon Ensign Tillman, U.S. N. Th(~ duties of the Hydrographic Division are various, numerous, and exacting, consisting in laying out hydrographic work, plottiug hydrography, examining and rnri(ying sheets from the field and drawings for photo-lithograpbs,aml in giving notification of newly discovered dangers, changes in hydrograph:r and changes iu the aids to navigation, so that the same may be properly shown on the charts at the earliest possible moment and furnished the mariuer through the monthly Notice to Mariners. The re1lort of Lieut. M. L. Wood, U.S. N., in charge of the Division, is forwarded herewith.
REP AIRS OF VESSELS.

During the past fiscal year the vessels of the Survey have been kept in fair condition, and a steam-launch and a sharpie, a small schooner of light draugbt, have been purchased or built. The latter vessel was built under special instructions from you for use in the inland waters of l!'lorida and Louisiana, where a ligbt draught is absolutely essential.

UNITED STATES UOAST AND GEODETIC SUHVEY.

A second vessel of the same class, sixty feet long and not to draw more than twPnty inches with a loacl of four and a half tons, i:s now being constructed by the same builder, :\fr. A. C. Brown, of Tottenville, N. Y. \Vith these limited dimensions, fairly comfortable quarters for three officers and eight men are obtained, with water and provision capacity for thirty days. I am informed ,by Mr. B. .A.. Colonna, Assistant in charge of Office and Topography, who first suggeste(l the build· ing of vessels of this class, that they in every way answer the purpose he had in Yiew in proposing them to you. The 8team-lann('h referre(l to ahove was purchased for use iu Puget Sound for three thousand dollars. It was at first the intention to build a boat better adapfod to the purpm;e than anything offered for sale, but the high prices charged for both hull and moti\·c power, together with the loss of time it would incur, rendered this not advisable. 'When an opportunity occurs, at, the encl of the summer season, changes in the internal arrangements of this boat can "be made, which will better adapt her for hydrograpbic purposes. No extensive repairs have been made to any one of tbe vessels, except possibly to the Hassler antl Endeavor. Neither of these vessels had been used for some tinw, and consequently a larger sum of money than usual was necessary to put them in proper condition for work. The stern-wheel steamer Barata,ria aud launches Nos. 3, 9, and 1G were sold <luring the fiscal year, they being olcl and not worth repairing. The schooner Silliman wa8 found to be in a condition that did not warrant her heing repaired, and there was moreover no neces8ity of retaining her in the Surn;y, as Wtl ban; more vessels of this class than are needed. This was by your direction represented to the Navy Department, with the sugg~stion that she be transferred for experimental purposes Rhonl'l that Department deem it advisable. The offer was accepted and the transfer m:1de, and the Silliman was afterwardR used 111 an experimental trial of the d,vnamite gun. In April the steamer Dafay was by your direction loaned to tlie New York and New Jersey Boundary Commission for the purpo8e of replacing the buoys iu Haritan Bay aud to mark the permanent boundary line between New York and New Jerse;r. In .M.ay the schooner Palinunis was tnrned over for the summer to the New York Fisheries Commission. The steam wliale-boat No. 21 attached to the schooner Yitkon was lost in tl~e month of Nm·ember, having been swamped, owing to the parting of a tow-line while alongside of the Yukon. The Herreshoff Launch No. 13 attached to tilie 1iarty in Vineyard Sound under charge of Lieut. C. P. Perkins, U.S. N., was also lost in Septemher, 1887, while running from No .M.an's Land to Uuttyhunk for a harbor. The vessels of the Sur,·es have been kept in fair condition during the past year. While the amount of the appropriation for repairs of vessels is ample for all ordinary overhauling, it will not he sufficient when it becomes necessary to make extended repairs to several of the larger vessels and at the same time to replace any of the steam-launches. The repairs to the Gedney necessary to place her in condition for passage to San Francisco, sheathing and other repairs to the lflake, and a general overhauling of the Endeai,or to place her in proper shape to take the Gedney's place in the Gulf, will exhaust so much of the repair fund as to render it difficult to keep the other vessels running during the fiscal year. It is important that the McArthur should be supplied with a new boiler at an early date, but this will be impossible during the present fiscal year (1888-1889) unless special appropriation is made. The clerical work in this office was performed by Mr. George J. Vestner, Mr. R. E. King, and Mr. W. H. Lanman until January 9, 1888, when Mr. J. H. Roeth was assigned to thii; <luty. This work, which is laborious and exacting, has during the year been satisfactorily performed by these gentlemen. In conclusion I would say that the inshore hydrography of the coast of Maine is, at this date, October, 1888, completed. The survey of Vineyard Sound will be completed next year, thus finishing the resurvey of that important thoroughfare from New York to Boston. The survey of the latter harbor should be ta.ken up at an early date, as the chart at present in use is not what it should be for so important a place. The hydrography was executed in 1861-1864

UNI'rBD S'rATI~S COAS'r AND GBODETIO SUIWEY.

under the direction of the Ilaruor Commissioners of tile State of Massachltsetts, so that the Survey has no work of its own to place llefore the public. 'rim original ltydrograpbic survey of thti Atlantic coast is practically completed, but examination aml resun'eys of our sand-bar harbors will be constantly required. Tho plan of dividing the coast into districts and having a vessel of the Survey fully equipped assigned to each district to gain all possible information necessary to keep charts up to date has frequently been a subject of discussion betweell us. The hydrographic survey in the Gulf is ne;trly completed; two years shoultl end it with average season's work. In the Pacific the work is not so far advance<l, owing to slwrt appropriations, insufficient number of vessels, and a very difficult coast to work ou. From these and other causes, notably among them, fogs, the work has necessarily been slow. I am of the opinion that it will take from four to six years to complete the development of the fifty-fatliom curve from San Diego to Puget Sound. The survey of Alaska, one of great importance, has been very rapidl~T advanced during the past year. The present scheme embraces only the usual inside steamer route to Sitka, but the increasing comm11rce, due to the couutry's great natural atlnrntages in the way of minerals, timber, a111l fisl1, seems to demaml that the survey of this important territory be extended to the outside coast a.s far as the Aleutian Islands and eventually to Bering Strait. Very respectfully, W. CI. BROWNSON, Lieutenant Commander U. S. Navy, Hydrographie Inspector. Mr. F. M. TIIORN, Superintendent Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington D. C.

llEPORT OF TlIE COAST PILOT DirISlON FOR TIIE FISCAL YEAR ENDINO JUNE 30, 1888.

U. S.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, October 19, 1888. SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report covering the work of the Coast Pilot Division during the fiscal year ending June .30, 1888. Under the general direction of the Hydrographic Inspect.or the duties of this Division involve the execution of work both at the office and iu the field. At tile beginning of the year the first editiou of Subdivision 21, and new editions of Subdivisions 6 1 7, and 9 of the Atlantic Loeal Coast Pilot were in the hands of the printer. Subdivision 21 has been put through the press and published. The new (third) edition of Subdivisions 6, and 7, in one volume, was in press at the close of the ~ear and will soon be published. The manuscript oftht1 new edition of Subdivision 9 has been returned, with the request that any alterations rendered necessary by change in aids to navigation, etc., since its preparation may be made in the manuscript, and this work is now in band. A new Coast Pilot volume covering the coast from Point Judith to the East River was practically completed at the close of the fiscal year and has since been sent to the printer, under the title "U. S. Coast Pilo~Atlantic Coast, Part IV-Long Island Sound, with approaches and adjacent waters." This volume was prepared as part of the large volume, now in preparation, which is designed to embra~e the Atlantic Coast of the United States. The plan followed is in conformity with the method of treatment proposed by me for Coast Pilot work, the adoption of this method ha\"ing been authorized by the Superintendent. Part IV is t-0 be issued separately to moot the tlemand for a Coast Pilot publication covering the section of the coast include<l therein. The manuscript for tbe first edition of the A tlantie Local Coast Pilot, Subdivision 22, Straits of Florida, has been prepared and is ready for the printer. Much work has been done in connection with. the preparation of the large volume designed to cover the Atlantic Coast. A great part of the manuscript for tho coast of Maine is practically ready for the printer. Much of the new work on the coast of Massachusetts llas been incorporated

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

in the new edition of Subdivisions 6 and 7 of the old Local Coast Pilot series. For Nantucket and Vine;yard Sounds the field-work has been done, and a considerable part of the office work. Buzzard's and NaITagansett Bays have received nearly all the attention that will be necessary. A part of the new litrge volume embracing the coast from Point Judith to the East Hiver is now in ·the hands of the printer to be published as a special issue, as already stated. Nearly all of the manuscript for New York Bay and Harbor and the adjacent waters has been prepared, as has that for the coast of New Jersey. In Delaware Ilay and River but little has been done; the field-work is still to be taken up. Much work was accomplished in connection with Chesapeake Bay and tributaries, which it was intenued to include in a separate small volume. This has not yet been done, owing to t.he many delays in printing new editions of volumes already on the catalogue but out of print. Considerable revision will now be necessary for the Chesapeake, aml this is now in hand. Work is also in progress on the shore from Cape Henry to Key \Vest, which can soon be put in shape, as it will probably be covered by less than eight.'· pages of printed matter. Excellent result~ are still obtained by the use, when desirable, of the general form of interrogatories devised with the view of obtaining directly from the best local sources, special information concerning our ports and harbors. Great courtesy bas been shown by local authorities in furnishing information desired. The field-work of collection, revision, and verification of data, has been carried on from time to time as necessary under special instructions, and reports covering such work have already been made. From the beginning of the fiscal year until in October I had command of the End{!avor, engaged in work of this nature on the Eastern coast and especially on the coast of Maine. En· sign William J. Maxwell and Mr. John Ross were with me on board the Endeavor, Ensign E. H. Tillman _being the only one of the Coast Pilot force at the Office during this period. The members of the party were detached from the Endeavor October 20, 1887, and resumecl duties at the Office. The results obtained while afloat have given a large amount of matter, now in manuscript, much of which is practically in shape for publication. After April 18, 1888, the charge of the Hydrographic Division devolved on me and required a large share of my personal attention until I again took up field duties, assuming command of the steamer Daisy, May 31, 1888, for Coast Pilot work in Nantucket and Vineyard Sounds and Buzzard's Bay. I was accompanied by Mr. Hoss wLilc engaged on this work, which was not quite completed at the close of the fiscal .rear. Ensign William J. Maxwell, U. S. N., was detached from the Survey Now.mber 20, 1887. Ile is an officer of excellent judgment and is zealous and industrions. I consider myself fortunate iu having had his valuable assistance. Ensign Edwin H. Tillman, U. S. N., and Mr. ,John Ross have rendered most efficien,t services in connection with the Coast Pilot work throughout the year. After my departure for field-work in May, 1888, Mr. Tillman had immediate charge of the details of Office work of both the Coast Pilot ancl Hydrographic Divisions, the duties of the latter neceR· sarily occupying the greater part of his time. Miss Glova B. Bower was temporarily assigned to duty in the Coast Pilot Division as a copyist, in April, 1888, and by instructions of the Superiutendent was employed in that capacity as a part of the regular force of the Division from May 1, 1888. Miss Bower pe1formed her duties to my satisfaction. Very respectfully, GEOHGE H. PETERS, Lieutenant U. S. N., .Assistant Ooa.st and Goodetic Suri,ey, Chief of Coast I'ilot Division. Lieut. Commander W. II. BROWNSON, U. S. N., Hydrographio Inspecwr, Coast alUl Geodetic Survey, W asliington, D. C.

There will always he a uecessity for lm,·i11g the records of work done by hydrographic parties in the field plotted, drawu, antl ,·eritied ill tlJis DiYisiou as rapidl,y as i·ossible, so that intelligent decisions can ue reached as to the data requin~ll for immediate use in correcting charts already published or in process of constrnction. l call ;rour attention to a reduetiou in the number of corrections required to be made on proofo and copies of cltarts owi11g· to chauge8 in the routine, aml th.e com;equeut reduction ii:t the number of corrections required to ht\ mallt~ by lrnud on copies of charts issued from this office. During the past few years, owing to the increase in the 11urnber of sources of information, correcting charts to <late of seudi ug from the Oflice had become a task i and a1; the1;e corrections relating to hydrogrnphy emauated from thiis Division aud had to be indicated on proofs for the information of other Divisious in the Office, tl1e labor required in this Division alone was quite an it1·m, and the applwatinu of these correctious to printed copies on t,be shelves of the chart-room wits <t S(Were labor which uecessarily intflfored with the rapid filling of requisitions. To reduce labor hotlt in this Division and in the cltart-room, a chauge bas been made in the system of Hupplyiug cnrrections and in correcting copies of cltarts to be issued. Iu consequence a material reduction has heeu made in the liability to error in supplying corrections to tlate and also in tile numher of corrPl'.tinus to b(~ applie11 hy hand, au<l tile accuracy of Uoast and Geodetic Survey charts issued for all pnrpmms materially increased. The care and labor formerly expc11de1l in applying hand corrections to proofs and copies is now applied in a different form with more gratif~'iug re:rnlts. At present it can be safely said that the chart:; of the Coast aud Geodetic Survey are practically corrected from all information received at tlie. Office to date of issue from the chart-room. The date of priuting and the date of issue from chart-room now indicate the limit of the office indorsemeut; an<l the increasing demand for the charts of the Survey on the part of the sea-faring colllmunit,y shows an appreciation of the improvements made in keeping important changes indicated to as late a date as possible. NotPs of corrections for charts ha Ye heretofore been j15sned quarterly in a "Notice to Mar· iners," until during the past year, when the issue has been monthly instead of quarterly, with satisfactory results in simplif.ving work in the DiYision and in giving earlier information of important changes to tl1ose using charts. -

The time required for isguing "Notices to Mariners" from the date of sending the copy to the date of mailing the printed notice has been reduced to about six or seven dap, which seems about as short as it can be made under the present routine of printing in a different part of the city, in au office where tl;le work loses its turn of precedence on accouut of the time necessarily taken up ·in conveying proofs backward aml forward. It is possible that arrangements could be made for this printing to be done in this building, aml it is certain that a cllange could be effected tllat would result iu economy to the Government and sllorten the time now required to publisll a "Notice to Mariners." Tllese monthly notices of chart corrections are intended to assist masters of vessels and other users of charts in keeping working co11ies up to date and also as a practical iudorsement of those requiring no corrections. Tlle data contained is compiled with great care from the records of this l>h'ision, of which they are partial abstracts. Nearly all letters relating to the routine work of the Division have been prepared for your signature. The duties of the Division are so complex that it is difficult to meutiou the actual work done by each draughtsman, as allowances. ham to be made for each in di vi dual sheet that is plotted, owing to the particular circumstances under which the llydrogra1lhic survey was maue. The draughtsmen have been emplo~'ed as outlined iu my report" of last year, with the exception that to l\Ir. E. H. "\Vy viii the greater part of miscellaneolls work was assigned. Where every one bas done his best aud responded promptly to every call, individual mention is useless. The following is a statement of the work performed:

IN TWO l'ARTS. -

PART I.-THE VALUE OF THE "ARCANO DEL MARE" WITH REFERENCE TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION IN mm EARLIER PART OF THE

SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.

By CHARLJ:GS A. SCHOTT, Assistant.

The extreme paucity of reliable magnetic records in the two centuries preceding the year 1700 is well known, hence any work falling within this period and apparently overlooked (as we find uo mention of it either in Hansteen's Magnetisums der Erde nor in Humboldt's Cosmos), would deserve careful examination respectiug the value of its contents conr.erniug terrestrial magnetism. We became first acquainted with the work through Volume ll of Justin 'Vinsor's "Narrati,·e and Critical History of America," Boston and New York, 18861 arnl introduced some information derived from it on pp. 310 and 380 of the Annual Report of the Coast aud Geodetic Survey for 1886. Further attention was lately drawn to the work, and at the suggestion of Assistant George Davidson, the Superintendent applied to the librarian of Harrnrd College, Cambridge, to have tbe work examined for any magnetic data it might contain. Through the courtesy of Mr. Winsor, wLo . allowed the work to be sent to Washington, we were enabled to make itll desirable extracts, and to have some of the chart!:; bearing on North American waters photographed for our historical collection. The work consists of two large folios bearing the title "Dell'Arcano Del Mare, Di D. Rdierto Dvdleo DvcaDi Nortvmbria, E Conte Di V Varvich; Libri Sei." Itis dedicated to ''Al Serenissimo Ferdinando Secondo, Grau Dvco Di Toscaua," and was printed "In Firenze uella stamperia di F. Onofri, 1646;" Volume I, in two parts, contains the text, and volume II, bearing date 16!7, i11 entirely made up of boldly engraved charts from the hands of A. F. Lucini. These charts comprise all regions then known to the navigator, hut in our remarks we :;hall confine ourselves wholly to those charts which relate to North America or to waters adjacent thereto. This elaborate nautical work, entitled the ''Mystery of the Sea," treats of astronomy as applied to· navigation, of nautical instruments, the construction of ships, the art of navig&tion, tactics and evolutions of men-of-war, etc., etc. But what is of special importance to us, among the methods of finding the longitude at sea the author brings forward (chapters VIII and X, tomo I), as others had done before him, one that depends on the observed changes of the magnetic declination, and to this particular circumstance may be ascribed the frequent references to declinations (varia· tions of the compass) made in the text and placed on the charts. Uufortun~ly there is no explanation respecting observer, date, or position, nor could we:find any tabular statement or any direct reference to the values delineated on the charts, whetLer from bona fide observations or possibly interpolated values; great care is therefore necessary in esti· ma.ting the real value of the information thus presented. Upon the whole the recorded declinations appear to be trustworthy, and if any interpolated values are given on the charts they are probably few in number and in some cases may admit of' recognition.
167

168

UNITED STAT.ES UOAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The lougitndes of the charts are counted eastward from the island of Pico,* one of the Azores; the modern determination of its initial meridian is 2so 281· 2 or 111 53m 52s. 8 W. from Greenwid1. (The latitude of Pico is 3go 25'.0.) East declinations are indicated on the charts by the term "variatio grecale" (i.e., east of north), and west declination by" rnriatio maestrale" (i.e., west of north); such expressio11s as'' la bnssola grechcggfa" and" la bnssola maestreggia" may be reudered "the compass (north end of t1ecdle) turw; toward the cast and towards the west," respectfrely. The charts appear to he a great ad nrnce 011 those prcce<ling t!Jem, being remarkably free from graphical conventioualism and distinguished hy clearneHs and conectness as then understood, yet. the work repeats two geographical bluuders of its time, Yiz: the definite location of the island of Friel'laudia to the south west of Iceland and between it aud Greeuland, and secondly, the close approach of tlm coast of A8ia towards the coast of Ualifornia.t Lik11 tlie earlier so called variation charts of Audrea Biauco (1436.) aud of Alonzo de Sauta Uruz ( lWO), tbe Arf'ano 1fol :\lare ouly record>; tile declination without any attempt to generalize the data, charts of iso-magnetic cun·es not being then generally known 011 account of their novelt,y. The first chart 011 the latter principle is tlne to Fatlier Christopher Burrus, of Lisbon (died in 1632). In consequence of the absence of the date to the declinatious, as gfren 011 the charts of the Arcano, no definite epoch can he a1;si~'lled to any of these magnetic data, and if we reflect that it was the general belil'f in those times that the declination at any oue place was im:ariable, it is certain that the colh·ctetl data must he taken as spreading oYer a number of years [lrior to HH6; nor must we forget tlrnt the diffusion oflrnowlcdgc was then quite slow.+ The first writer who clearly asserted the existence of a change iu the declination with time was Gellibraml (Discours mathematicall on the variation, t·tc., l63ii). Thus it is high)~· probable that the greater part of the declinations gi\'en in the Arcano must he referred to some time in the 8ecoud 11uarter of the 17th ceutury. If we look for intl·rrrnl evidt~uce of the dates, it woul<l secm that, in general, the latest information is given, though in some cases the \'alnNl ma;v en·n refer to the preceding century, as for im;tance in the case of the <leclinatiom; given on the coast of California, oft' Cape l\leudocino and off Punta de los Reyes, which in all probability refer to time of Drake; perlutps nothing later was procurable for this then out of the way coast. The declinations gfren in the West Indies indicate data intermediate iu time between 1600 and 1700, at any rate, later than the declinations upon which Ilansteen based his isogouic lines for the .rear 1600; while the declinations given for the coast of Nova Scotia and the New England States appear to be other than those ohsen·ed by Champlain (1604-1612) and lludson (1600), and the,y are more consistent among themselves than those given by these navigators. In view of' the fact that the secular variation generally affects the declination at a moderate rate, 'rn may, in tbc absence of any better information, and when some definite date is desirable, assume 1630 ± 15 years as probably uot leading to any great error. With n·ference to N ort!J America arnl adjacent regions, I have collected all the declinations given in the Arcano and placed them, as 11ear as their exact location could be given, on the aecom. ·The adoption of one of the islands of the Azores for the location of the initial meridian in counting longitudes saal to harn <·ome about throu~h the c1rcn111stanc11 ~hat at the tune of adoption the variation pf the compass-noodle was zero or 11e~rly zero at those 1sla:i'.l·"· but for positions to the eastward the variation was easterly and increasing with d1sta~1co fr?m _the1!1'. aIUl tl!r pos1:10ns to the west w~rd the var1at1on was westerly and increasing. The temporary sclect,1011 of th1H 11nt1al merultan is thus connected with the great problem of determining lougitnde at sea by the aid of the dircCLiou of the horizontal magnetic needle.

panying map (Illustration No. 19), where they are shown by x 's. To judge better of their intrinsic value and to render the information more useful for the study of the secular variation, I ha\·e also delineated on the map the system of isogonic curves, which result directly from a simple graphical process. These curves exhibit but very moderate deviation;; between observation and representation, jtlld they seem to· confirm the curves constructed by Hansteen for the epoch 1600, and they clearly place themselves intermediate between this earlier epoch and that of Halley's Tabula Nautica, a century later. Among these lines there is one of special interest, namely, the agonic line, for the epoch of the Arcano, which swept over the North Atlantic, and is delineated 011 the accompanying map (Illustration No. !.:O) by means of the following data found in the Arcano. Firnt, on the east coast of South America, south of the Orinoco, in latitude+ 8°, there is little declination west; in latitude+ 1o the declination is ~o west; in latitudd- 30 it is small, probably east; aml in latitude-Szo tbe declination is 30 east; thus the line of no declination probably intersected the South American contineut in latitude _50, or in the vicinity of Uape San Roq 1ie. Next, in the bay of Panama, in latitude 7p, oft' Point Ulm me; we have the declination ~o west, and off Burrica, between Nicaragua and Veragua, the declination is marked "inappreciable," thi:> is in about tbc same latitude; the agonic line must therefore luwe passed from Point Burrica through Costa Hica and across the lake of Nicaragua, since we find already JO east declination in latitude lOio, longitude 8G 0 , or off Point Juan. Thirdly, we find the declination zero at the island of Pico, iu the Azores, with easterly declination to the east and westerly to the west of tlwse islands. Fourth, we have the statement that at the Cape Yerde Islands the declination was inappreciable, but at the Canary Islands reached 2° east,. The sweep made by the agonic ctll"rn, as shown on our illustration, is thus justified, and when compared with the Banst.een's delineation of it for the epoch 1600, goes to show that it had not reached its extreme position at the beginning of the century. At all places situated within the western or concave bend of this agonic line the declination was westerly, and, in general, the westerly declination increases with increasing distance from the line; on the other hand, on its convex or easterly side the declination is of the opposite sign. The data given in the "Arcano" thus strongly intlorse the belief that westerly declination prevailed i'a the region of the Greater and Lesser Antilles for about a century and a half after their discovery, but in Halle_y's time this was no longer the case, as shown iri the following comparative table for some principal places or their sites.

These numbers, if reliable, would imply a rate of change much greater than any noticed after. wards in this region, and would necessitate a corresponding change in the form of our analytical expression for the secular variation, as heretofore.given.for these localities, in order that the formulre lnay apply to the early times here in review. However, Hansteen's chart for 1600 rests upon very scanty observations· and on wide interpolations, while the values taken from the Arcano appear systematic and may be assumed to rest on independent data; nor do the Balleyan nlues impress us with any feeling of accuracy; they certainly hav~ the character of extreme values, and were proba. bly influenced injuriously by observations made in Jamaica, where the needle may have been locally

deflected. The diflicuity of recognizing the true law of change from conflicting testimony may be exemplified in the case of Port Royal, where, according to Robertson, the declination was 6:1° East in 1660, and hence contradictory to the values given by Halley and in the Arcano. According to our researches the easterly declination at Port ltoyal reached its maximum about 1778 with 60 2' East. We are still reluctantly compelled, from want of sufficient data, to confine our analytical expression for the law of the secular variation for stations in this part of America to times after the middle of the 18th century. Turning now our attention to the coast ofNew England we can there confront the information given in the Arcano with the somewhat earlier observations made by Champlain and Hudson. It should be remarked that the observations made by these navigators were difficult to reconcile. Champlain's observations between N oYa Scotia and Uape Uod n1ried but little iu amouut (about20) 1 but indicated high westerly declination, whereas Iludson's were extremely irregular, and as far as could be made out were of small westerly declination. Now, the Arcano gives values lying between these two extremes, and moreover confirms Hudson in making tile declinations decrease when passing to the southwestward and thus disposes of the anomal~' shown in Champlain's values, which indicated the opposite direction. Champlain':; observations date between 1604 and 1612, with an average value for the Gulf of Maine of 18° W.; lI udson's refer to 1609, when on his third voyage, and his results rauge from 10° W. to zero, wltereas the Arcano gives 12~ 0 W., and apparently does uot contain any value attributable to these navkators. The declinations given in the A.rcano, in the region of the Gulf of Maine, would seem to demand a correction of ahont + :P, and to Cl.rnmplain's results on the coast of Maine and Massachusetts I am inclined to assign corrections between - lo and-3°, and his large but consistent values may possibly find a ready explanation in the custom of European navigators of this age to set their compass-card over tli.e needle with au index error equal to the average magnetic declination prevailing over the regions ordinarily traven;ed by them, and this was particularly the custom with navigators of the northwestern coast of Europe. Compasses so fixed by the maker may give rise, when unnoticed, to a constant error, as is supposed above. The compass nsed by Hudson behaved differently, and its defoct is easily accounted for uy supposing that the needle bad then parted with the greater amount of its original charge of magnetism-in other words, it had lost too much of its directive force to have bee11 of any account. No critical examination was made of t!Je magnetic information contained in the Arcano for other parts of the world, as the8e are not directly connected with the iuquiry which brought the work under our notice; but if so extended, further light may be thrown on the sources whence its magnetic data were derived. Upon the whole the scrutiny of the work left au impresHiou fa\·orable to its reliability, and if the omissions of observers' names and <lateH !]etract mnch from its ,-alue it ne,·ertheless fills a gap in :t period of which onr information has heretofore been most scanty aud unreliable.

PART IL-HISTORICAL REVIEW OF THE WORK OF THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY IN CONNECTION WITH TERRESTRIAL .MAGNE11I8M.
By CHARLES A. SCl'IO'l"l', Assistant.

Although one of the minor branches of the 01ierations of the Survey, the study and application of the results of terrestrial maguetism from a practical point of view are of great importance, not only to the surveyor, but also to the mariner, to whom they are indeed indispensable. This will be readily understood by simply referring to tlie extended use snrve_yors have made of the magnetic needle for the demarkation of land and the consequent frequent necessity of retracing old lines so laid out and recorded. With reference to the needs of the navigator, the charts of the SnrYey require the impress of the compass; on these arc recorded the variation of the needle, and the annual change is stated so as to render the sailing directions applicable for other years besides that of the issue of the chart. With reference to the adjustment of the compass on board ship and the construction of deviation tallies to answer for difierent directions, inclinations, and positions of the ship, aknowledge of the magnetic dip and the intensity is demanded. The work of tlrn Survey and the results secured may be advantageously shown by a short historical review. In the early years of the SurYey, under its first Superintendent, the magnetic declination {the scientific term equivalent to the mariner's" variation") was supplied on the charts as found by the ordinar,y nautical instrumental means then in vogue. In the transactions of the American Philosophical Society, Phila., 1825, he proposed to measure reltitivc magnetic intensity by means of oscillations of a needle, no method for absolute measurement being then known. The magnetic work of the Survey, however, may be s<.1.id to luwc commenced in its three-fold a5pect-the declination, the dip, and the intensity-with his successor in office in 1843. Prof. Bache bad previously made a magnetic survey of Pennsylvania, which, although a small l>eginuing, was not followed m1til in quite recent years by the magnetic surveys of Missouri and New Jersey. He imported new instruments suitable for more refined measures of the declination than could be secured by the older instruments, and at the same time capable of exact determinations of the intensity in absolute measure; he also procured dip circles, and availing himself of the additional temporary aid of Dr. Locke, of Cincinnati, and of Prof. Renwick, of Columbia College, the work of observation was then fairly started, and has since been prosecuted uninterruptedly by various assistants of the Survey. In consequence of the dual or polar character of the magnetic force it resistell for a long time all attempts of measure expressible in the W1ual dynamical units, but in 1833 Gauss showed how this could be don6; and after the invention, in 1836, of the portable magnetometer, his method for the absolute measure of magnetic intensity came into general use. Those who are acquainted with magnetic observations, which also include those astronomical operations which involve geographical position and azimuth, know the delicacy and refinement of theoperations when great accuracy is demanded, and it should also be remembered that in the early days of the development of practical methods there were none of those facilities we now possess in the number of trained observers, in the home manufacture of instruments, and in the many treatises for instruction now at hand.

and discusision has been prosecuted, and the results ha,·e been published from time to time in the annual reports. At first the observations were confined to the vicinity of the sea coast, hut it waf: soon found that the charts could not satisfactorily be supplied with the Yalues for the variation of the compass unless the obsen'ations were extended snfticie11tly inland to girn proper direction to the magnetic lines or isogonics as they are called, which cun·es exhibit for any place the angular difference between the astronomical and magnetic meridian,.; for a certain epoch. Meanwhile, imrYeyors from all parts of the country have applied for information, not only for the present nllue of the 1lecli11atio11, but, what was far more difficult to supply, for its valtw at Home earlier period. To satis(y this inquiry, and to pro,Tide a better knowledge of tl1e annual change of the declination needed for the charts, a more sy:;t1~matic general collection of all magnetic observations taken within the limits of the United Stares from the earliest to the present time was 111111ertaken, and this register bas beeu kept up siuce 1878, at which time the field of activity of the Stll'\"C,Y wal'.I enlarged hy tl1e change of CoaRt into Coa;;t and Geodetic Surn\y. This collectiou, arrange<l by Stat1·s and 'l'erritories, now comprises seyeral thousan1l ohservationR, for declination, dip, mid relative and total intensities, and together with the direct sun·ey work, which in ,July la;;t, comprised 731 st<itious (many of them occupied se,·eral times at definite interYals), constitutes the material from which most oft he deductions were derived, and which mark the mh·ancemeut of our knowleclge in this <lepartment of research due to the Survey. The first permaueut magnetic obsernttodes in North America were established at Toronto b,y the British Government about 1840 (which observatory is still in operation under the auspices of the Canadian Gm·ernment), a11d about the same time at Philadelphia, 1840-4.':i, at Girard Uollege. The latter was directed by Prof. Bache, who, after taking charge of the Ooa st Survey, took arlvantage of the newlj' invented application of photograph,r to automtitic registration, a11d procured one of the Brooke rnagnetographs, and canse1l it to lie set np and to record continuously the Yariations of the declination and of the horizontal and 1·ertical intensities at Key West, Fla., between 1860 antl 1866. After tlle lapse of half a sun-spot cycle, which is the minimum duration for which it is profitable to kt·ep up continuous ohsern1tion at any one place, the instrnments were transportell to Madison, "Wisconsin, where, betweeu 1876 and 1880, a second series of observation8 was l'.<ecnred. Whcu the support and co-operation of the surn>y were sought for the two international expeditions fitted out b,y the United States for polar research, the ueeded magnetic instruments, both absolute and <lifferential, so far as the Survey could supply them, were furnished, and the observers were trained during the short time permitting. The magnetic records of the secoud year (1882-83) at Point Barrow, Alaska, by the party in charge ofJ~ieut. Ray, were made by the Brooke magnetometers, which had in the mean time been altered for direct or eye observations. A superior self-recording magnetic apparatus, knowu as the Adie magnetograph. after the Kew pattern, and likewise working by means ofphotography, arrh'ed here during the late war, but for want of funds was not set up until 1882; this superior instrument was located at Los Angeles, California, and continues to give excellent results. It is intended to terminate this series towards the beginning of the year 18!:10, and then to re-mount the instrument at San Antonio, in southeastern Texas, and later on to mow. it to some place in W asl1i11gton Territory, in order to cover as much as possible of the region, for which, heretofore, our knowledge of the laws of terrestrial magnetism bas been most incomplete. The first isogonic chart published b;y the Sun·ey, entitled" Lines of Equal Magnetic Declina. tion," will be found in the Annual Report for 1855; the last one, in three sheets, appeared in the Annual Report for 1882; a comparison bt·tween these charts will show in the most conspicuous ·manner the progress made in our knowledge in this direction dming the interval. The index to scientific J)apers in the Annual Report for 1881, under the headiug of Terrestrial Magnetism, enumerates uo less than sixty.six titles up to the close of 1880; this will give some idea of the activity of the survey in this dl.'partment. Several important investigations have appeared in the later Annual Reports; in the report for 1882 we have an appendix discussing the distribution of the magnetic declination in the United States for the year 1885, the results being based ou observations at more than 2300 stations. In the report for 1885 we have an investigation of the magnetic dip

and intensity, with their secular variations and their geographical distribution in the United States; this appendix, 145 quarto pages, involved great labor in its preparation; it is accompanied by three finely executed charts, besides the illustrations in the text; it discusses no less than 2000 dip observations and more tban 1500 observations for intensity. The results for secular change of dip and iuteusity are new. In the report for 1886 (now published) A11pendix 12 contains the sixth edition of an investigation, much sought after, namel;r, "The secular Yariation of the magnetic declination in the United States and at some foreign stations." From a small beginning in 1859 this paper has grown to be a complete depository of magnetic results available for the study of the secular change within our territory, and the author discusses most thoroughly the laws goYerning this mysterious movement, the cause of which i8 as yet entirely unknown, though in its nature it must be cosmical, since we cannot think of any adequate cause within the earth to produce, so far as we can judge, with remarkable regularity, the ob~erved slow angular and supposed cyclic motion of the needle for centuries. The deductions rest on lOil observations made at 94 stations; the earliest observations on our western coast date from the 16th century (Sir Francis Drake), the earliest records on the eastern coast dating- from the beginning of the next century (Htulson and Ohamplain). In this branch of research the Survey profited by the use of the valuable collection of declinations and dips, the earliest on record, made by Prof. E. Loomis (now of Yale College) who published them in Silliman's Journal in 1838 and 1840, and without which our results would not possess the extent :ind degree of reliability they now have. In this 6th edition, which spreads over 116 quarto pages, we have minute references to observations, together with their critical examination. The resulting secular change, illustrated by several diagrams, is expressed analytically and is also gfren in tabular form; .. the laws which so far have :tppeared to govern this motion are stated and embrace the whole of the area of the Unite{l States (inclusive of Ala.ska), and are given sufficient geographical expansion to facilitate their connection with similar relations referring to Europe, South America, and Eastern Asia. The magnetic records brought liome by the Polar Expeditions in command of Lieutenants Ray and Greely were placed in the care of the Coast and Geodetic Sun'ey; this material was subjected to computation and discussion ancl arranged for the press. The Point Rarrow work, 1881..S::{, forms part VI of the official publication ofLwut. Uay's expedition (published in 1885), and the work done at l!'ort Conger (1881-83), uuder Lieut. Greely, will form Appendix No. 139 of Vol. Il of the official publication now passing through tbe press. The reduction, analysis, and discussion of tbe automatically registered material at tbe magnetic observatories still awaits adequate computing foree to bring out the many laws and complex relations involved in the ceaseless changes of the magnetic force. When the Survey was called upon to be represented in the Government Exhibit at the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States at Cincinnati, Ohio, 1888, the writer pre.pared an article ou terrestrial magnetism and provided four miniature diagrams, reduced from the larger maps published by the Survey, as suitable illustrations of the present distribution of the terrestrial magnetic force, hoth in direction and intensity, within our geographical boundaries. As a matter of general interest, these reduced maps are here reproduced, together with a brief explanation.

THE SECULAR VARIATION OF rrHE MAGNETIC DECLINATION IN THE UXITED STATES AND AT SOME FOREIGN STATIONS.
By CHARLES A. SC:HO'I'T.

AsBiBtant, CoaBt and Geodetic Survey.

[Seventh edition, Juno, 1889.]"

Introduction.-The practical nature of the inquiry, and the necessity of looking to the publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to supply the latest information on the subject of the changes, secular and otherwise, of the direction of the magnetic needle, has causml an ever. increasing demand for the results of these investigations now conducted by the Sun·ey for thirty years, and this in turn has acted as a stimulus to advance our knowledge of the secular changes of the magnetic force, both for direction ancl intensity, and to keep tbe results up to date. It thus becomes necessary from time to time to submit to analysis any additional observations, to re-discuss the older series, and publish the results at intervals of a few years, as well as to direct new observations to be made at those places where they may contribute most effectively towards the elucidation of the laws of change. Appendix No. 6, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 18851 contains an exhaustive article on the secular change of the magnetic dip and the magnetic intensity, as obseryed in the United States from the earliest to the present time. It is accompanied by three maps, showing the actual distribution of these magnetic elements for the epoch 1880.0. This, together with the present communication, completes the inquiry in this branch of knowledge as far as this could be done at the present time. During the two years which have elapsed since the last issue of this paper the available material for the discussion of the secular variation of the declination has greatly increased, bringing np the number of stations contained in this edition to 109 and the number of declinations to 1245, for each of which full reference is given, as well as a comparison of the observed and computed values. The average number of observations for a station is 11. It is satisfactory to remark that
·This article originally appeared in Coast Survey Report for 1855, Appendix No. 48, and was eoutinnecl in Reports ofl856, 18S8, and 1859, Appendix No. 24, pp. 296-305. In the second edition, in Coaat Suryey Report for 1874, Appendix No. S, pp. 72-108, the investigation appears grea: ly extended; the substitution of a sine for a cosine function was made and the epoch was changed from 1830 to 1850; also some use was made of Cauchy's method of interpolation for the establishmtlnt of some second periodic terms. The third edition, issued in J mrn, 1879, appeared in pamphlet form, and is not contained in any annual report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The geographical range of the investigation was much enlarged, and the paper was illustrated by two plates. The next or fourth edition was brought out in June, 1881, and forms .Appendix No. 9, Coast and Goodetie Survey Re.port for 1879; it was illustrated with three plates. In the fifth edition, of November, 1882, .Appendix No. 12, Report for 1882, there were discussed B:l7 declinations, observed at 82 stations, situated in the United States and a few in Europe, South America, Asia and Polynesia, the latter for the purpose of extending our knowledge of magnetic changes beyond our immediate sea coast. The sixth edition forms.Appendix No.12, Annual Report for 1886; it is distinguished by a more systematic arrangement of its contents and by a more liberal introduction of observations made at sea near our coasts, besides, the number of stations to which the record and discussion extends, is increased to 94 with an available material of 1071 obseued declinations.

the introduction of tbe new obsernttions tended greatly to improYe the m1merical ''alues of the analytical expressions, aud to g-ive greater accuracy to the results deduced, as wel1 as to prod1rne greater uniformity in such phases of the secular variation as the amplitude of the motion and the epochs of maxiurn autl rniuima or times of magnetic elongation, so for as these depend on the geographical po;;ition of tlw stations. In tile collection of ouserved declinations, as heretofore given, I had sparingly made use of observations taken on board ship, introducing such observations only from necessity, i. in the absence of observations on land; but in the last and prsent discussion apparently trustworth~· observ:ttious made at sea ha'e been more freely introduced, and in the case of the great number of observations by Spanish na,·igaturs towards the close of the past century, along our Pacific coast, their united testimon~- lrns great ls benefited our range of knowledge by giving greater security and unity to results which before appeared doubtful or scattered. The collection of this material is contaiued in Appendix No. 7, ()oast and Geodetic Survey Heport for 1885, and was communicated by Assi1;tant G. Davidson. Its value was then conjectural, but the discussion of it proved to be highly creditable to the reputation of the navigators of that period. I find the average probable uncer tainty· of a declination (variation of compass) observed uu board the wooden hulls of those times not to exceed± io, the same as I llad assigned to the observations taken by Vancouver, an amount which probably represents the best practice of that epoch. In our owu times, for vessels composed of iron and steel, and otherwise largely supplied with such metal, when swung on (sa_y) 8 or 32 equidistant points of the compass, the observed declination will still be subject to a probable uncertainty of about ± 0°.5 to ± 00,3 'l'he immediate object of the discussion of the secular change of the declination is to furnish the means of referring observed declinations from one epoch to another, as, for iustai1ce, when surveyors are required to re-discoYer and re-trace old lines originally rnu uy compass, but which had lwcome ouliterated in the course of time, or when the Yariation is demanded for the compasses plaef'd 011 the sailing coast and harbor-charts of the Survey. The principal demand for the results of this article comes, however, from sun·eyors and from memhers of the legal profession, which demand fri'q uently arises from litigation in cases of disputed land boundaries. Sin('e the source where 1mclt information could be had became better kuown, the unmber of applications to the 'l'o facilitate reference to stations and results, thti contents of the paper are arranged in three parts-an eastern, middle, aud western division-in which the places follow in geographical order; and the final tableti of results gi\'e the declinations, after the year 1850, for every fifth year, instead of for every tenth as in the older editions. The tables are extended to include the year 1900, tlw predictions for that epoch~ however, must necessarily rernaia rough appro:cimations. Tu remler this investigation more useful to practical men, I have thought it desirable to preface it with a brief acconnt of the principal motions, systematic as well as apparently irregular, to which the direction of the magnetic needle has been found subject, in order to clearly separate and distinguish these chauges from the secular variation, which last ii; here made the special object of treatment. The magnetic declination. -The magnetic declination (or variaticn of the compass, as it was for· merly called. by surveyors and still is by navigators), at any place, is the angle contained between two vertical planes, one being the astronomical or true meridian, and the other the plane in which the horizontal axis of a freely suspended magnet lies at the time. The former plane is fixed an1l the latter variable, since it is found that the needle when delicately suspended is generally in a state of slow or tremulous motion. The magnetic declination varies with respect to space antl time; it is, therefore, necessary to girn with the statement of its measure the exact time (year, day, and hour) when an obser\'ation was ma<ll", as well as the geographical position of the place (the latitude and longitude, it suffices to give these co.ordinates to the nearest minute of arc). The declination is called" west" when the north end of the magnet points to the west of true north; algebraically thi1:1 fact is here indicated by a+ sign, and if" east" by a - sign. It is a matter of observation that the magnet, when light, and delicately suspemlecl (by a single fibre of raw silk) is seldom or never at rest, but is always shifting its direction, or is in a state of oscillation or of tremor, and occasionally

subject to sudden violeut and irregular chauges. These angular motions ham been classified as regu1ar (periodic) and irregular variations, and of these we propose to notice briefly the priucipal ones, as also their mag1Iitudes as they may be met with within the limits of the United States. The solai·-d-iurnal Yaria tion consists in a systematic angular movemeut of the direction of tlw magnet, having for its period the solar day. Its phases depend ou local time, and its character is -, the same for the greater part of the northern hemisphere; viz, about the time of snurise the north end of the ueedle is generally found approaching to or near its most easterly extreme or elongatio11 from the magnetic meridian. This phase happens, for instance, at Philadelphia, on the yearly average, abont 811 a. m.; at Key West, Fla., about 8t11 a. m.; and the same at Madison, \Vis. It is subject to au annual variation, being about three-quarters of an hour later in the mouths when the sun is south of the equator, and about one-half of an hour earlier in the summer mouths tha11 its yearly average time of occurrence. The north end of the needle then begins its principal daily motion, and reaches the opposite extreme position, or its western elongation, about half past 1 o'clock p. m. It is reached a few minutes earlier in snmmer an<l a few minutes later in winter, and hardly varies half an hour for different localities. After this epoch the nee<lle takes up an easterly movement and gradually returns nearly to the direction from which it set out in the morning. Frequently an interruption, or small reversed motion, is exhibited during the night. At Philadelphia the averagr, daily direction is reached in snmmer abont 10t11 a. m. and in winter about lO~h a. m., and generally within half an hour of these times at other places. The magnetic meridian is crossed a second time, generally between 7 and 9 p. m. The angular range between the morning and afternoon elongations, or tile diurnal range, is about 8' oil the average at Philadelphia and about 5~' at Key West; in higher magnetic latitudes it is more, in lower less. This range is subject to an annual inequality, hei11g much more conspicuous in summer than in winter (1~' at Philadelphia in August and 5' in Nornmber). At Sitka, Alaska, the diurnal variation from observations between 1848 and 18G2 showed an average range of lOJl' with the easterly extreme at 8 o'clock a. m., and the westerly extreme about 32 p. m. At Point Barrow, on the Arctic Ocean, in latitude 71018', the daily range iR nearly 40' with the easterly extreme about 8 o'clock a. m., and a delayed westerly extreme about 5 p. m.-as observed by Lieut. P. H. Ray. At Lady Franklin Hay, GL'innell Land, in latitude 310 44', the daily range, on the yearly average, rises to 10 G' with an easterly extrmne as early as lJt a. m., and a westerly extreme as early as 1 p. m.-as ob:-;erved by Lieut. A. W. Greely. It is fnrther Ruhject' to a periodic inequality related to the eleven-year cycle of the sun-spots. 'l'he diurnal motion is least in years of minimum sun-spots (as in 185G, 1867, 1878 and 1889, for instance) and greatest in years of maximum suu·spots (as in 1860, 1870 and 1883), the factors being 0.7 and 1.3, about, of the average amount of these years respectively. This daily variation appears at times intem1ified, at other times enfeebled, and during the winter months there are occasionally days on which it can not be recognized. Ob;;ervations must f>e corrected for time of day in order to reduce the re~mlt to the average direction of the twenty-four hours; a table gi\·eu for this purpose is fouud in Coast aud Ge0<letic Survey l~eport for 1881, Appendix No. 8, Art. 6. The annual variation of the declination is so small that a mere mention of its existence suffices; its amplitude is at most l~ minutes of arc. The variation depending on the solar rotation has a period of about tvrenty-six days; its amplitude is likewise small in our latitude. - The lunar inequalitie.~: These we also pass over on account of their small amplitude. TLe principal ineqtiality of the lunar diurnal variation exhibits the peculiarity of two maxima and minima on each lunar day, thus partaking of the character of the tides. The range of this inequality at Philadelphia is about 27", and at Toronto, Canada, about 38". Other lunar inequalities are of yet sm:tller order. The secular variation of the magnetic declination, our subject proper, is most probably also of a periodic character, but since it requires centuries for its full development, and since, as yet, uo one cycle has actually been completed within the range of observation, we are obliged, in the absence of any reliable theory, to follow up the phenomena, tentatively, by continuous observations. The secular motion may be compared with a wave motion or with an oscillation of a pendulum which comes to rest momentarily at its extreme positions or elongations and moves fastest mid way between these extremes. Smaller variations within this -period have also been detected, but the general

angular movement (say of the north end) of the magnet may be descr;bed as follows: About the times of maximum deflection the magnet appears almost stationary or only slowly oscillating about the same average direction for several years (as obserwd by ordinary or rough instruments); imon, however, the effect of the secular change becomes perceptible, increasing gradually, year by year; this progressive angular motion soon reaches an annual maximum nilue, after which, still moving in the same direction, it slowly diminishes in speed and finally becomes again stationary, now at the opposite extreme digression, after which po8sibly it will return again to its first position. Within the area of the United States and south of latitude 4!l 0 a complete oscillation of this kind may require between two and a half and three and a half centuries, during which time the magnet wou1'l swing twice, i. e., once forward and once backward, through an arc of several degrees, generally keeping within the limits of 40 and .so of total range for our geographical boundaries; in other localities the period and range are very much greater. The remarkable regularity of the motion is well shown on the accompanying diagram (illustration No. ~1) for Paris France (selected on that account), for which place we probably possess the longest series of o!Jservations; the period is about four and two-third centuries, and the range nearly 33°. To illustrate further the effect of the secular change, we may take the case of New York City. In this locality the needle was observed to be in nearly a stationary condition about Hl82, its north cud pointing then fully 90 to the west of north; it then moved easterly and reached its easternmost digression about 1784, showing at that time only 4ko west declination. Ever since this epoch the motion has been west.erly, its present value being nearly 8~o ,V,; the greatest annual change (nearly 5') was apparently passed about the middle of the century. The times of these stationary epochs are different at different localities; the last epoch of eastern elong-ation was noted earliest in l\laine towards the close of the past century, later the Mississippi Valley, and it has now reached the coast of California and of Washington Territory. At present over nearly the whole of the United States the effect of the secular change is to increase weRt declination, or (what is the sarne) to decrease east declination; lmt on parts of the Pacific coast and for some short distance in the interior the effect is still opposite, viz, an increase of east declination. Alaska, howHer, is to ue excepted; there easterly declination is now slowly decreasing. There are, consequently at present two regions or belts of no change, one in the east, just entering the State of Maine, the other, on the west coast of California, Oregon, and Washington Territory, just passing out to sea. They will !Je referred to in detail farther on. It is this regular motion, known as the secular variation, which renders it necessary to reconstruct isogonic charts from time to time and to correct the compasses and magnetic bearings on our charts. Although this secular variation is perfectly systematic, it does not generally appear so; the observations are more or less irregular when made at different places iu the same general locality, either on account of small observing errors or in consequence of local deflections, or for the reason that the ordinary daily variation and other inequalities have not been fully eliminated from the results. Among the latter irregnlarities mnst he classell the11lagnetic disturbances or storms.-Tbese may occur at an~T time, and are, when taken individually, when classified and beyond the power of prediction; but attacked by the statistical method, i. when averages are taken of many thousands, they are fouud to be subject to various laws. Their presence is generally indicated by sudden deflections, and by rapid and great fluctuations of the direction of the needle as compared with its normal position; which otherwise might have been expected at that time of day and mouth. They often take place simultaneously over distant regions of the globe, and in duration may be confined to a few hours, or they may last a day or even for several days. They are frequently accompanied by auroral lights and by strong electric earthcnrrents. When analyzed in large numbers they exhibit a solar-diurnal variation, the westerly aud easterly disturbances, however, following different laws. They also have an annual variation and seem to depend largely on the eleven-year cycle of the sun-spots. Irrespective of direction of the disturbing forces the most disturbed hours of the day are generally those between 7h an!l lOh a. m., and the least disturbed those between 211 and ()h p. m. Westerly disturbances occur most fre. qnently about 8h a. m., and least about Sh p. m.; they exhibit a single daily progression. Easterly disturbances reach a maximum about 8h p. m. and a minimum about 2h p. m.; they exhibit a double daily progression. Westerly and easterly disturbances appear to agree in their annual variation, in their times of maxima, i.e., in August, September, and October, and in their times of minima,

At Key West, Fla., the maximum deflection noticed between 1860 and 18G6 was 21'.4 At Madison, Wis., where the horizontal magnetic intensity is considerably less, very much larger cleflectionshave been noticed. Thus, on October 12, 1877, one of 48', and May 28, 1877, one ofl o 24'. In high magnetic latitudes where the horizontal cotnponent of the magnetic force is feeble, the disturbances attain great intensity, thus at Lady Franklin Bay, Grinnell Land, Lieut. Greely noted an extreme range of declination of not less tllan 20° 28', this occurring during the great November storm of 1882. We now proceed to the special consideration of the secular variation of the magnetic declination, beginning with an account of its first recognition. Historical note.-The following brief historical remarks on the magnetic declination and its secular variation have been prepared from extracts from Humboldt's Cosmos (Otte's translation, Loudon, 1849-1858), Vol's II and V; from the Encyclopredia Britannica, 9th edition, Art. Compass, Vol. VI {Boston, 1877), and from E. '\Talker's treatise "Terrestrial and Cosmical Magnetism," Cambridge, (England), 1866, in which works fuller references will be found. The Encyclopredia of Experimental Philosophy, London, 1848, Art. Magnetism, as well as Gehler's Physikalisches Worterbuch, Le!pzig, 1825, Art. Compass, were also consulted. The first notice of the magnetic needle as applied to navigation we meet with among western (European) nations does not date further back than the eleventh or twelfth century of our era, but in China the directive property of the magnetic needle was made use of on land as early as the twelfth century B. 0., and, according to t.radition, even at a much earlier time (2834 B. C.). In the third and fourth centuries of our era Chinese vessels were guided by the magnetic needle, and through them a knowledge of the polarity of the needle was conveyed to India and thence westward. In the ninth century Chinese merchants traded in ships to the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. Probably through the influence of Arabian navigators, or through the agency of the Crusaders, the use of the mariner's compass was introduced into Eastern Europe. Among the first European writers of the middle ages who refer to the loadstone or to the compass is the Icelandic historian, Are Frode, who lived about the end of the eleventh century. He states that the directive property of the loadstone was then known to seamen in northern countries. Next are mentioned, Alexander Neckam, in two treatises, " De Utensilibns " and " De Naturis Rerum," of the twelfth century; Guyot of Provins, in 1190, and Jaques de Vi try, between 1204 and 1215. lfaymond Lnlly, in 1272 and 1286, remarks that tlie seamen of his time employed the magnetic needle, and from Torfmus we learn that the compass was in use among the Norwegians about the middle of the thirteenth century. Among then-western nations the construction of the instrument underwent great improvements, particularly by the hands of Flavio Gfoja, of ..A.malphi, Italy, in 1302. Tke declination.-From a Chinese work, written between 1111 and 1117 .A. D., we learn that the needle was then suspended by a thread and that the mode of measuring the amount of the declination, it being then west {or, as there expressed, east of south), had long been understood. It can hardly be supposed that the fact of the needle, in general, not pointing exactly to the true north and sontb could have been overlooked in the twelfth century, on the coasts of the Mediter-

ranean, in places where the declination reached 60 to 10°. A passage interpolated in a Paris MS., a·copy of" Epistola Petri Peregrini," etc., of 1269, states the declination to have been determined by him in Italy at 50 E. Columbus probably was the first who records the change in the sign of declination with change of geographical position. On starting from the west coast of Spain he II ad em;t declination. Ill September, 1492, in the Atlantic, in latitude28°longitude28°(about) heobser\·ed 11 o W. He bas thus the merit of being the first to discover a part of an agonic line, or line of no de· cliuation. The first scientific work in Europe in which the declination is treatml at any length and deduced from actual observations is that by Boroughs, published in 1581, entitled "A discourse on the Variation of the Cum pas or Magneticall Needle," and is dedicated to the" tra\·aillers and mariners of' England." In 1599, Prince Maurice, of Nassau, the lord high admiral of the Low Countries, recommended seamen to keep a register of the declination in every part of the world they might visit. lsogonic charts.-It il,i supposed that on tile clmrt of Andrea Bianco, drawn up in the year 1436, certain declinations only were marked, but Alonso de Santa Cruz, in 1530, constructed the first general declination chart, though based upon ,·ery imperfect material. Upon the chart by Father Chriistopher Burrus (who died in Hl32), published at Lisbon, the magnetic lines are called "tractus cbalyboeliticos." About 170 years after Alonso de Santa Cruz, Edmund Halley published his celeurated isogonic chart for the year 1700, based entirely upon observations. [Tabula Nautica, Variation um l\fagueticarum Index, juxta obsen·ationes anno 1700.] His voyages of the years 1698, 1699, atHl 1702 were undert11ken 11t the expense of the British Government. This chart comprisp,s tlle areas of the North and South Atlantic, the Indian, and the extreme western part of the Pacific Ocean. Isogonic chart::; became quite numerous after Halley's time. Those by Hausteen (Maguetismus der Ertle, 1819) deserrn special mention; his earliest one is for the year 1600. In 1838 Gauss published liis " General theory of Terrestrial :.\Iagnetism " (in Resaltate, etc., des Magnetischen Vereins, Gi.ittingen) and the resulting isomagnetic curve;i were afterwards charted. A translation oft.he theory aud copies of the charts are given in Taylor's Scientific Memoirs, Vol. II, London, 1841. In the work of A. Ermau and H. Petersen, "Tlie .Foundation of the Gaussian theory and the phenomena of Terrestrial Magnetism in the year 1829," Berlin, 1874, the general distribution of magnetism over the globe is shown on six charts for the epoch 1829. For the most complete magnetic charts depending directly on observations, the reader is referred to General Sir Edward Sabine's Contributions to Terrestrial .\fagnetism, Nos. XI, XIII, XIV and XV, Phil. T1·ans. Roy. Soc., of the years 1868, 1872, 1875 and 1877, respectively. These charts refer to the period 1840 to 1845. Charts on :Mercator's pr~jection of" Curves of Equal Magnetic Variation" were published by the English admiralt.Y for the epochs 1858, 1871 and 1880, and by the Deutschen Seewarte for 1880.· The latest isogonic charts for the United States of America, reduc<>,d to the epoch 1885.0, will be found in the Coast and Geocletic Survey Report for 1882, Appendix No. 13, in three sheets, Nos. 38, 39, 40, with a second edition of the first two numbers in one sheet, issued in February, 1889. The seculari,ariatfon of the declination.-The discovery of the gradual change of the declination, whioh for any one place had previously beeu supposed by philosophers to be constant, is due to Gellibraml, of Gresham College, England. In 1635 he published his work, entitled "A discourse mathernaticall on the Variation of the l\fagneticall Needle, together with its admirable diminution lately di8covered." He hased his conclusions upon the recorded ohservations of Boroughs (1580), of Gunter (1622), and his own ob11ervations (1633-'34), showing that in the vicinity of Loudon the direction of the needle had clrnnged in the interval fully 70 to the westward. From this time the fa.ct of the secular rnriation was completely established, and it remained t,o later times t,o deter· mine it.'> extent and develop the law governing this change, and to endeavor t,o find its cause. That the \'elocity w:ts not uniform was soon perceived, and the apparently periodic character of the variation was promiuently forced upon the attention of obseners when the needle reached a.stationarv condition, as, for instance, in the eastern part of the United States towards the end of theeighteeuth century, and then recommenced its motion in a direction opposite to that it had before. Similarly at Paris, France, the secular cliange was westward between the stationary epOQhs of l&ro (about) , aud 1812 (about), since which time the needle has commenced retracing its course eastwardly. Nearly mi(lway between such stationary epochs the annual change is observed to be a maximum. Set' illustration No. 21, upper diagram.

ANALYTICAL EXPRESSION OF THE SECULAR VARIATION OF THE :MAGNETIC DECLINATION.

The secular 1'ariation can be represented with considerable accuracy by means of a circular or lrnrmonic function, as migllt be expected from the almost unlimited adaptation of such functions to all forms of periodically recurring phenomena, provided a sufficient number of terms are intro' dueed. The formula employed for our purpose may he \nitten-

D = o + r sin (am+ c) + r, sin (a,m + c,) + r 11 sin (a 11m + c11 ) + ....... . Where D =magnetic declination at any time t, positirn when wt>st, negative when east. m = nurn ber of years and fractions of a year from an epoch t 0 for which 1850 has been adopted ; hence m = t - 1850.00 a a, a 11 · · · · are factors depending on the adopted periods P P, P 11 · · · · of tlle several

Thus to a=0.9, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5 there correspond periods of 400, 360, 300, and 240 years respectirnly. r r, r 11 · · · · · · are parameters or semi-ranges, c c, c11 · · · · · · epochal constants of the several periodic terms, and o= a constant, representing the average or normal declination about which the periodic fluctuations take place. The quantities o, r r, r11 · · · a a, a 11 · · · and c c, 0 11 · · · for any one locality must be determined from the observations made there at >arious times, a~td their most probable values are to be deduced by application of the method of least squares. We begin by assuming a suitable >aluc· for the length of the principal period, and the first periodic term of the formula 1s treated as follows: Put o=o,+x where o,= an assumed approximate value of o and x a correction to it; also put r cos C=Y antl r sin c=z, then the conditional equations will take the form :

O=o,-D + x+

sin am.y+ cos am. z

from which the numerical Yalues of x y z are to be deduced in the usual way by means of normal equations. To determine the value of a (and similarly of a, a 11 · · · ) the computation is repeated three times (or more if necessary) using the slightly clianged valnes a +Lia and a-Lia, from which that particular value of a is found and finally retained which renders the sum of the squares of the differences of observed and computed declinations a minimum. In some cases where certain observations were evidently less trustworthy than others, and which nevertheless could not be dispensed with owing to the small numbt>I' of obser>ations or on account of their special value with reference to time, special weights were assigned; generally each observation received the weight unity, a few imperfect observations the weight one-half, and to some particularly valuable observationi:i double weight was assigned. In tllese cases the conditional equations were multiplieil by the square root of their respective weight. The material on hand wa.;i thus carefully scrntinir.ed respecting its relative and ab.;olute value, and of observations evidently grossly in error no notice whatever was taken. In finally selecting what seemed to be the best expression for the secular change at a station, I have also frequently been guided by the acoord of the various constants entering into the equation when compared with corresponding values in tlJe equations for surrounding stations. ·When applying Cauchy's method of iuter1'°lation the form D=o + rcos c. sin ma+ rsin c. cos 1na was found more convenient in use. This method was employed for establishing such second or third periodic terms as appeared demanded uy the observations, but only a few such terms could be determined as they generally failed in consequence of the insufficiency in number of data or for want of sufficient accuracy in the observations.

and n, equals the number of unknown qnantities in the expression for D, as determined from the obscrrntious themselves; when weights p cuter, we substitute pL1 2 for L/ 2 and then obtain the probable error of an obser\'ation of unit weight. The greater part of this apparent probable error or rather lll'Obable uncertainty in the representation is due to the fact that the obserrntious collected at auy one place were not genemlly made at precisely the same spot, thus introducing the effect of any local irregularities in the 11istribution of magnetism in addition to the o:rlinaQ· \>bserving errors. In the case of observations e\·ideutly not corrected for dirunal variation, and for which the hour of the day of observation was not knowu, the received imperfect value had to be accepted; this remark applies more particularly to accurate measures for which alone this correction is of importance. Tlwre arn some stations where either from want of a sufficient number of observations, or from shortness of interrnl between the first and last obser\'ation, the length of the period of the seen· Jar Yal'iation could not be made out.

The principal uncertainty in the investigation thus arises partly from large observing or iustru· mental errors in the older observations made with the ordinary compasses or with rude instruments generally, and partly, in case of modern observations, since the introduction of more refined instruments (the magnetometer with collimator magnet and theodolite), from changes in the local posi· t ions and from imperfect elimination or irregular variations from the normal direction of the magnet. l n consequence of the extended use of iron and steel above and below ground, and the spread of the electric telegraph, telephone, and electric-light wires, combined with the rapid growth of cities extending tbt1msekes over the sites of the older stations, it is found difficult to select and preserve

at such places a suitable locality for i:>ermanent use. Accurate investigations of the secular varia· tion can only be carried out at regular magnetic observatories or in localities permanently exempt from all disturbing influences. In applying at present a periodic function for the representation of the secular variation,· it should be under~tood that this does not neaessarily imply that the phenomenon is a periodic one, or -, even that it has an invariable period of the length assigned, or that it must exhibit a secoud motion of like character to the first; it is possible that a whole period may not be completed without some minor change of law. The aim is simply to represent by a suitable and sufficiently compreheusive formula the changes which are observed in the direction of the horizontal compo· neut of the magnetic force from year to year and during centuries, and to provide the means for the further investigation of the phenomenon with a view to ascertaining its probable cause~ as well as for predicting, at least for a few years in advance, the probable direction of the needle. This last information is required in the construction of our hydrographic and coast charts, for the use of the navigator and for the surveyor. The analytical process is thus one of a tentative character and the formulro are necessaril,Y empirical and in need of continual reconstruction and improvement. Employing thus a formula or interpolation capable of represeutiug the phenomenon ouly as far as observed, it would manifestly be uusafe to exteud its numerical results either way much beyond the limits of observation. The predictions are here given within proper and safe limits, and the tabular results should not be trans gressed in either direction unless the results are sustained by additional observations.
COLLECTION OF OBSERVED :MAGNETIC DECLINATIONS SUITABLE FOR '.l'HE INVESTIGATION OF THE SECULAR VARIATION.

The material collected for this pt1rpose has been arranged geographically in three groups for greater convenience of reference and of comparison of results. It approximates to an arrangement proceediug from stations of the greatest west declination (at present) to thoi-e of greatest east declination, and comprises the whole area of the United States as Wl'll as a few foreign localities, which were introduced for the special purpose of preparing the way for geographically extend· ing and connecting the Jaws of the secular change, so far as they can be made out for North America. Group I comprises stations mainly on the Atlantic coast of the United States and the region east of the Appalachian range. In particular, tile stations of this eastern series extBnd from Newfoundland and Eastern Canada along our Atlantic coast as far south as Florida. Added to these are one station in France, one iu the Bermuda Islands, and one in Brazil. Group II includes stations mainly in the central part of the United States, between the Appalachian and Rocky Mountain systems. In particular, the stations of this central series cover the region south of Hudson Bay and within the United States, including the entire area drained by the Gulf of Mexico. Added to these are two stations in the West Indies and one in Central America. Group III comprises mainly the Pacific coast stations, and includes the Rocky Mountain region. In particular, the stations are scattePCd from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec through the western coast States and Territories, including Alaska. To this group are added one station in Siberia and two in the ~andwich Islands.
* Ifwe suppose for the moment that the secular variation consists simply of a swing about a mean position, the deJlecting force being a maximum at the times of elongation and zero for the epoch midway between, we may obtain some rough evaluation of tho magnitude of the horizontal deflecting force when greatest. Thus, at Philadelphia the half-amplitude or the secular deflection eitbei' way from the nol'mal equals nearly 3°.3 and the last extreme deilectiou 3.3 1 . happened about 1802. At that time, then, the deflecting force corresponded to 57. 3=17 nearly of the normal horizontal foree acting In the plane of t.be meridian. This deflecting force is very much greater than the <lefleoting force which produces the daily solar variation, the latter being at mo5', at Philadelphia, for an average amplitude of 8 1.0,
equal to

34~:. 7 = ~ nearly of the ea.me normal horizontal force.

Eiich group is treatetl separately; the record of observations is given first, with such notes appended as seemed tkmanded for each locality; then follow the analytical formulm expressing the l'lecnlar change, next ar1-1 given the comparhmns between observed and computetl values, and the istatement of results is completed by decennial tabular values of the declination up to the year 1850, after that by compnte1l values g-i\·en for every fifth year1 ending with 1900. A comparison of the results reached in the several editious of this paper shows a gradual improvement of precision, yet much more is expected through foture accumulations of data promising results more compre· hensive and reliahle than can be declueed at present.

*Mr. Thomas Kelbaugh, surveyor at Mount Carmel, Baltimore County, Maryland, communicated to the Coast Survey Office (letters dated August 17 and 24, 1877, ancl April 28, 1879) 52 cases of observed (or allowed for) changes of magnetic <leclinations between two given dates. These differences were mostly from redeterminations of magnetic bearings of old lines made with the common surveyor's compass, by different individuals and with different instruments. Their locality was generally within a radius of 15 statute miles of the city of Baltimore, and ou the N., the NE., ancl N\V. of it. These snr",·eys were made by order of the Baltimore County circuit court, in consequence of disputed land boundaries. Other values Mr. Kclbaugh copied from the record books of the county surveyor and his assistants, between 1805 and 1825. (These 52 differential values were carefully scrutinized hy me and finally combined to 12 mean results, as given in the above table results Nos. r to 1 r inclusive and .Ko. 16. To these several clitferences I have adCted the respective values adopted by me for the declination at the time of the resurvey. These latter data resulted from a formula for Baltimore a.> established by me in 1877 .-SCH. J 37.-WASHINGTOK, D. C. 1=77°

20. 2 E.

t The secular variation observed at Paris is illustrated on accompanying illustration No. 21. It is introduced for the purpose of showing the extremely systematic character of this variation. In the upper half of the diagram the dots indicate the observations, and the smooth curve represents the declination according to a constant and the first periodic term D=+6°.479+16°.002 sin (0.765 m+I r8° 461 .5). At this station the phenomenon of secular variation has now been followed up for about 349 years, in w:1ich interval it exhibited two well marked extremes, viz, about the year 1581 a maximum eastern position, and about the year 1812 a maximum western position; the interval between these two consecutive elongations is 231 years, which may be regarded approximately as the time of half a period; in the formula the numerical value of a implies 470 years for the period. The secondary wave superposed upon the primary is shown in the lower half of the diagram; it has two characteristics, viz, a variability in the parameter, that is a diminution in the size of the wave since about 1540, with a possible increase now, and secondly a variability in the length of the period, which was nearly constant in the second half of the sixteenth and throughout the seventeenth centuries, but afterwards diminished rapidly. Both variations, if real, are undoubtedly periodic, though from want of sufficient data our tabular values are limited in time. It appeared to me doubtful whether one or two secondary waves lie between 1740 and 1870, and since the above diminution of the period hinges upon this question, two analytical expressions were presented in a preceding edition of this paper, one showing one crest, the other two crests within the interval. The latter expression is here given the preference in consequence of its better representing the latest observations. The factor (4.04, etc.) of n, where n=t-1700 corresponds to a length of period of about 90 years, which at present has diminished to about 57 years. These variations necessarily complicate the formula. The law, however, may be studied at Paris to better advantage. The station was only introduced here with the object of prominently showing the stately secular swing of the needle, and to facilitate the connection of its phases with those noted in North America.

*The maximum west declination, according to the formula, was reached in 1799, but according to direct observation, in I8o7 and a.gain in 1814; the latter value, however, would certainly place it too late, the observation referring to noon and to a single day. The observations when plotted appear stunted about the time of turn in the secular motion ; omitting the effect of the secondary wave, the primary wave would place the maximum in the year 1812. t·According to Mr. Monreaux's observations (Memoires divers; observations magnetiques faites a l'observatoire du Pare Saint-Maur, pendant l'annee, 1885) the decrease between 1884.5 and 1885.5 was 61.3

RESULTS FOR GROUP !.-EASTERN SERIES.

Tabular values of magnetic declinations. Computed magnetic declination at each station for every tenth year of the series, and after 1850 for eYery fifth year. .A plus ·sign signifies westerly declination, a minus sign easterly declination. The first tabular result for any station indicates that the first observation made there falls between that tabular date and the next one following it.

The stations of this central series are distributed over the region south of the Hudson Bay and over the area between the eastern and western mountain ranges inclosing the drainage of the Gulf of Mexico; added to it are two stations in the West Indies and one in Central America. Observations were collected and discussed for secular change of declination at the following places; the stations are arranged in the order of decreasing latitude:

*The geographical position here given depends on that of Mannsville as determined by the U. S. Lake Survey. The table gives zero declination for October 1, 1797. This mistake originally arose, I suppose, by confusing the annual change, which was then about zero, with the declination itself. Mr. Colvin himself point~ out elsewhere in his report of 1886 that the declination was not uro in the Adirondack region about that time, but reprints the table uncorrected.

RESULTS FOR GROUP IL-Magnetic stations mainly ill the central part of the United States between the Appalachian and Roeky Mountain ranges, with additions in British North America, Canada, the West Indies, and Central America. The letter D in the last column of the table stands for declioation, a plus sign indicating west declination, a minus sign east declination. The letter m stands for t-1850.0, or for tbe difference in time, expressed in years and fraction of a year, for any time t and the middle of the century; it is to be taken within the range of observation at any station.

Tabular values of magnetic declinations. Computed magnetic declination at each station for e\·ery tenth year of the series, and after 1850 for every fifth year. A plus sign signifies westerly 1leclination, a mi~us sign easterly declination. The :first tabular result for any station indicates that 1he first observation made there falls between that tabular date and the next one following it.

III.-Collection of Ma.gnetie Declinations from the earliest to the present Mme, observed on or near the l'acyic coast of the United States a.nd u:est of the Rocky Mountains, and extending over the region from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexfoo, northward to Bering Strait and the Arctic Ocean, coast of Alaska.

To tl1ese are added observations at a station in Kamtchatka aifd at two stations in the Sandwich Island~. This collection comprises only places for which sufficient data w<·re found for the dh1cussioa of the secular change of tbe declination. Since the issue of the fifth edition of this paper a valuable collection of magnetic data has been pubfohcd by As:ii:itant G. Dadd:ion in Appendix No. 7, Report for 1885, entitled "Collection of some Magnetic Variations off the Coasts of Califuruia, and Mexico, observed by Spanish Navigators in the last Qmuter of the Eighteenth Century." The contents of this communication bearing directly upon our researches, it was submitted by me to a careful scrutiuy, when its value became at once apparent, as it enable<l me to assign for that early period a closely approximate valne for the 1leclii1atio11 for any part of the coast between San Blas, a leadrng- Mexican port at the time, aml Va11cou ver Island. By means of these obsernttions, when properly discussed, almost as satisfactory a valuH could be given as if it had been directly observed, and consequently I have introduced sucli restllts iu the general collection of declinations at all places where observations were wanting about that period and in some instances made use of these values as checks on observations which otherwise appeared doubtful. It will therefore be proper to explain the method of procedure and give the results deduced, before presenting the general collection of data for the secular-change statious on the Pacific coast. All observations in question were made at sea, hence individually they give little reliable information for any particular place, but collectively their value becomes apparent if it can be shown that the probable error of a single observation is reasonably small and that the law of geo· graphical distribution of the <leclinabon can be made out satisfactorily. This was effectefl by plotting all observed valnes for localities not more than about 40 of arc or about 240 nautical miles distant from the coast and representing the distribution of the declination a111 a function of the latitude and longitmle, but disregarding the effect of the secular change during the interval 1774 to 17!>0; in other words, making no allowance for reduction to mean epoch. To facilitate treatment of so large a number of observations by application of the method ofleast square~, the 122 obserrntions selected as within our limit were united into mean values, for 7 groups, which could readily be marked out on the chart. No rejection was made and the values forming each group may be identified, if desired, by the epoch and their latitude and longitude without special reference to Appendix No. 7, Report of 1885. These groups are given below. In the table the groups are marked "A" to "G,'' and the headings No., r, cp, il, D indicate the running number, the year and fraction, the latitude, the west longitude, and the observed declination, respectively.

For the relation D= j ( cp, i\.) I have found it sufficient to make use of the following terms only, others depending ou the square or on higher powers would have no sensible effect upon the result, uor would they be warranted by the uncertainties in the observations themselves:

The remainders in the last column indicate a sufficiently close representation of the observations. }'or the probable error of the mean of a group we have r=0.674

I [~rI =:f:00.205or ± 12'. "Vn-m

On an average the number of observations in a group is 17, hence the probable errorr0 of any individual observation for declination is 0.205 v' l 'for ±0°.845 or ±51', a tolerably fair value, considering the time when these observations were made. It also compares favorably with tlie estimated average probable error of au observation made by Vancouver. To draw the isogonic lines as represented on the accompanying map (No. 24) it was only ne®S· sary to find the roots of the above equation for certaiu assumed values of D, ranging from _50 to -180, and plot the corresponding values of <p and 1 or points for each line. A comparison of the isogonic lines of 1783 with those of the present time sliows that a century ago the general direction of the curves was not very unlike the present one, but they were less crowded than now. Iu the space between San Blas and tlie northern part of Vancou;-er faland we find a change of declination in 1783 of 13°, whereas in the same space we now have mo of change, and, rouglily speaking, the declination a century ago was 4° less easterly than at present in the region of Sau Blas and 6° less than at present at Vancouver Island.

Series of Magnetic Stations mainly on the Pacific Coast and in the region of and west of the Rocky Mountains.
The stations of this western series are irregularly scattered over the region extending from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico, to the Arctic Ocean, Alaska. Added thereto is a station in Kamtchatka, Eastern Siberia, antl two on the Sandwich Isl:rnds group. In this series the observations for magnetic declination have been collected and discussed for secular variation at the following places, arranged in order of increasing latitudes:

He discussed the differential hourly observations made at the malinetic observatory between 1842 and 1849, basing the annual means upon the absolute d· terminations of Jan. 4, 1843, when D=28° 481 .9 E., and of March 4, 1843, when D=28° 57 1 .3 E.

N. B.-This important Asiatic ·tation was included in the discussion on account of its proximity to the \Vestem Aleutian or Rat Islands, and as affording the means for connecting the law of secular change with that found to prevail m·er Siberia. For information No. 3, part of 4, and of Nos. 5, 7, and 9, I am indebted to Mr. Marcus Baker, temporarily (I 879) attached to the Computing Division of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office.

The following two stations on the Hawaiian Islands, which were first introduced in the third · edition of the paper on the secular cbange, are here retai u ed, but without giving for them an analytical expression of the law of change. This was thought to be the proper course to pursue in view of the uncertainty now attaching to the former values in consequence of later and important information bearing on the subject. In.a letter addressed to me by OurtisJ. Lyons, assistant Government Survey, dated Honolulu, January 9, 188(, Mr. Lyons expresses his conviction that from 1850 to 1884 the secular variation was increasing the easterly declination prevailiug over the Hawaiian Islands, and cites his experience on Hawaii, viz: "From a number of compaR1; bearings observed by me in 1853 when compared with the respective bearings taken by tbe same compai;;s and the same observer in 1872-'73, the increase of declination was 40', he11ce annual increase 2'.0" Again, in 1873, Mr. Lyons made careful notes of a magnetic bearing of a base line in Oahu and repeated the same with the same instrument in 1884: and found an increase of about 20', hence annual increase 1'.8 He also states that he knows the spot where Commander Wilkes's observatory stood at Honolulu in 1841, aud that the .old sit.a is now incln.ded in the palace yard; at this plaoo he finds the declination in 1884 to be 90 30' E., hence annual increase l'. 7 If it thus be a fact that from about the middle of this century to the present time east doolhmtion at the Hawaiian Islands has been on the increase, as believed by :M:r. Lyons, the explanation might be found in the presence or obtrusion -of a secondary wave of sufficient range to have temporarily overpowered and concealed the ordinary effect of the priwa.ry wave of secular motion.

292

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODhTIC SURVEY.

There certaiuly was indicated by the observations an increase of east declination from the earliest times for which we have any record up to the year 1832, some years more or less, when apparently a maximum was reached; this last feature it would seem we have now to give up and a wait. further development before we can be certain of our deductions. In a second letter t-0 me dated Ilonolulu, April 23, 1884, Mr. Lyons gh:es further informatio11 supporting his former statements by fresh observational eridence of direct measures, aml gives as his result that the annual increase of easterly declination between 1871 and 1884 was about ?r (1'.9 + 2'.2 + 1'.5) or 1'.9 very nearly.

Observations inclosed within parentheses are proposed for omission in any process for representation that may be employed.

No expression of the above observations by means of e. periodic function will for the present be attempted, as it seems impossible, without undue and arbitrary straining, to reconcile such a. formula with the condition imposed by Mr. Lyons, i. e., that the easterly declination was increasing on the islands from a.bout the middle of the century to the present time; we therefore prefer t.o suspend our judgment as to the direction and amount of the secular change a.t the present tintei and. shall wait for further development.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

In a volcanic region like thitt of the Hawaiian Islands it is absolutely essential for the elucidation of the secular change in any of the magnetic elements that the successive observations should be made at the same stations, otherwise local disturbances may completely hide the true progressive movement and render all comparison nugatory. Even with this precaution we are obliged to l)Ssume that the law of secular chauge has not at times been suddenly interrupted through the agency of volcanic eruptions or through the effects of earthquakes. A complete magnetic survey of this group of islands could not fail to throw much light on the distribution and character of the local disturbances, as well as furnish evidence whether or not the secular change over disturbed and undisturbed regions is the same, and it is t.o be hoped that it will be undertaken by the Hawaiian Government Survey. The Hawaiian Islands group i!:l magnetically considered no less interesting than are the Bermuda Islands, in which latter group, however, there is less liability to abrupt local changes in the curves representing the distribution of magnetism than in the former.
RESULTS FOR GROUP III.-Magnetic stations on the Pacific coast and Rocky Mountain region;- also in Mexico and Alaska a.nd in some foreign countries. In the la.st column of the table the letter D stands for declination, the minus sign indicating east declination. The letter m stands for t-1850.0 or for the dift'erence in time, expressed iu years and fraction of a year, for any time t and the middle of the century ; it is to be taken within the range of observation at any station.

WESTERN SERIES-Completed.

Tabular values of magnetic declinations. Computed magnetic declination at each station for e\·ery tenth year of the series, and after 1850 for every fifth year. A minus sign signifies east declination, .a plus sign west declination. The first tabular result for any station indicates that the first observation made there falls between the tabular date and the next one following it.

G-R.APHIC.AL ILLUSTRATION OF THE SECULAR VARIATION AND OF THE ANNUAL CHANGE.

In a preceding part of this paper we have already made use of the graphical method to exhiuit to the eye tile motion of the needle as ob8erved at P;uis, and since this kiud of representation has the great advantage of readily impressing tile facts on the memory and of affording easy comparisons _and generalizations, the secular motion ;ts observed at four leading stations is introduced on plate No. 22. These 8tations are New York, Baltimore, San Francisco, and Sitka. As an aid to mnemonics, the degrees of easterly declination are shown on the diagrams to increase toward the right or east, and consequently the degrees of westerly declination increase toward the left or west, the ordinates beiug cousidered as directed north and south (true); the time scale increases downward where additional observations can be plotted more conveniently than on the top. The observed declinations are shown by dots, the computed declinations by a continuous curved line. These diagrams show in a couspit.mous manner the great. regularity and persisteney of the secular variation, and thus im1lfess the mind with the fact that the explanation of it must ultimately be referred to forces of a periodic character having their origin outside the earth and acting simultaneously over large areas and with great regularity, and probably having their immediate source directly or indirectly in the sun, with a probable dependence on planetary configurations. The effect of these deflecting forces Oll the magnetic condition at points on the earth's surface is subject t-0 great modifications as manifested in the observed variations in the amplitude and in the duration oftbe secular oscillation at places which, geographically, are widely distributed. At the present time we are not yet in possession of any theory or even of a plam>ible working hypothesis as to the true cause or origin of the secula1· variation, and are consequently constrained to pursue our researcheti empirically through the aid of continued observations and new discussions. On plate No. 25 we give the annual change of the declination for the epoch 1890, for all places discussed and falling within its limits. The numbers are expressed in minutes of arc, and are directly taken from the preceding tables. A plus sign indicates increasing west 01· decreasing east declination, as the case may be. In order to know where the declination is west and where it is east, the agonic line (or line of no deviation connecting the places where the magnetic and geo· graphic meridians coincide) for 1890 is introduced; for all places to the right, or to the northward and eastward of this liue, the declination is west at that epoch, and for all places to the left, or to the son th and west of it, it is ea.st at that time. The 1ilate also showR the positions of this agonic line for tile epoch 1797-1800, about which time it had abont reached on this coast its extreme northeastern position, having come up from the southward; appareutly it rested bere a fow years and then commenced to retreat over part of its previous course. At tbat time, in this vicinity, it passed between V\7 ashington and Baltimore, and extended out to sea just south of Cape Henry, Va. It is not easy, however, to determine the exact time when this stationary condition bappenedi there may be an uncertainty of several years in consequence of the ordinary irregularities i11 the direction of the needle and the extreme smallness of the secular effect, which is overlaid and hidden by the former; besides, the same year will not answer for all parts of the curve. The plate shows also the positions of the a.gonic line for the epochs 1850 and 1875, and it is hardly necessary to remark that while about 1797 its geographical change was nil, its rate of change southward along our Atlantic coast has continually been accelerated, and it will reach a maximum speed at the time of the middle of the secular swing. It will be noticed also that for nearly the whole of the United States and for 1890 the annual change bas a positive sign; in other words, the north end of the needle moves westw~trd, increasing west or cliwinishing east declination, and the same is true for Alaska; but there are two regions of exception where the opposite of this motion is observed, viz, one in the extreme northeast, outside of our territory, in Newfoundland and 11art of Nova Scotia, the other in the extreme west, which is less accurately known than the other a.ud comprises a narrow strip along the coast of northern California, Oregon, and Washington. Shaded bands on the plate indicate the position of those regions for 1890, where the J?Cedle will have apparently cea1:1ed to move, or will have assumed, temporarily, a stationary condition; western elongation or maximum west declination having been reache<l at all places within the Nova Scotia. belt, and eastern elongation or 'maximum east declination at all places within the Pacific coast belt. These IJands, like the agonic line or a.ny other isogonic eurve, continually and gradually shift their position, to which circumstance we shall presently recur. The condition of the hori-

zontal needle wit11iu these llelts may be characterized as being in opposite phases as regards the secular \'a.ria.tion. It would not be difficult to construct cu rv~s of equal an1111al change for any gh1 en epoch, as was tlone lly tile writer for a limited area (Ooa~t. S1uve,Y ltepo1t for 1Su5, plate No. 28), in which systt>m the auove l.Jelts would form tile zero lines, hut the subject is sufficieutly plain without 1mch aid, and the existing scanty material docs not warrant such detailed exposition. The line of maximum annual change might iJe expected to lie geographically midway lwtween the two zero regions, which we find roughly to be the case. If we follow up the direction of the eastern or Nova Scotia band of present "zero" annual change we shall Jiud it to crol'ls the equator and to pass toward the southwestern coast of Africa; tlie western or Washington, Oregon, and California band of" zero" annual change, when produced southwards, will also cross the equator, and roughly running parallelt with the Atlantic belt will follow the direction of the South American coast towards Cape Horn. The following table of the annual change of the magnetic declination is derived, simply, from a generalization of the precediug results; it answers for the epoch 1890 and refers to tlic ceu tral part of each State, Territory, or geographical sub,livision. The change is given in minutes and itl:i sign is omitted since we know wei;;t declination to be increasing or east declination decreasing:

the time lieing, pointed due north aud south. By uniting such places as represented on a chart, by a curve drawn through them with a free hand, we obtain a so-called agonic line which passes over all places of no angular deviation of the needle at that particular epoch, and within the geographical limit of the region under consideration. Such a line is part of a system of isogonic curves, ~nd although only an artificial aid, like these curves, it possesses, no\·erthclcss, some special interest as a convenient representative for exhibiting the secular movement or systematic changea in time of the isogonic system in its vicinity. For the two centuries immediately following the re-discovery of America, the magnetic records which have come down to us are very few, rough, aud the positions are scattered over large spaces, so that the location of the agonic line for A. D. 1500, attempted by me, is little more than a conjecture, and depends mainly on the position of two points in the line, the first one found by Columbus, September 13, 1492, when he notes the needle to have passed from the east to the west of the true meridian. At noon on that day he was, according to my calculation of his track,· in latitude 2so 21' aml longitude 290 16'. The second point lies further north and is due to Sebastian Calwt ,t and dates from 1497 or 1198; he found, when on the meridian 110 miles west of the island of'Flores, one of the Azores, and in latitude approximately 460 or 47u, that he was in a position where the needle had "no variation." We have further reason to suppose that this agonic line produced passed somewhere north of London, and at its other extremity at some distance south of the Greater Antilles, a.-. shown on plate No. 20, accompanying. The next position given is for A.. D. 1600; it is copied from Hansteen, and as his authorities for ithavealready oeen referred to in connection with our iuquiry of the value of the "Arcano del Mare" of Robert DmUey,:j: no further comment is needed here. For the position of the agonic line about the time 1630 ± 15 years, we simply have to refer to our detailed account when investigating the contents of the Arcano, upou the authority of which it wholly rests. Coming now to the ,year 1700, we possess the admirable isogonic chart of Halley, based upon obseryations made or collected oy himself. However well the distribution of the declination al011g- our Atlantic coast may be given on this chart, we believe the c:µrves over the Antilles and of the Gulf of l\Iexico and Central America to be susceptiule of improvement, as already intimated. The data at our command for t.his epoch are sufficiently numerous, yet ma11y are deficient in accuracy or unreliable. To test the ,-alue of this material and to give greater precision to the 1sogo11ic curves in the vicinity of our -------------------------·*For particulars see two papers in Coast and Geodetic S11rvey Report for 1880, viz: Appendix No. 18: "An attempt to solve tbe problom of thn first landing placo of Colnm lrns in the New \Yorltl," bT Ca[>t. G. V. Fox, As.9istnnt Secretary of the Na>y, 1861-'66; and Appendix No. 19: "An inquiry into tlrn variation of the compa8soff the Bahama Islands at the time of the laud-foll of Columbus in H92,'' by Charles A. Schott·, Assistant. In connection with this subject it may be remarked en passant that., in the writer's opinion, the controversy about the fir~t landing place and tho track of Columbus among the \Vest Indi11, Islands subsequent to it, may now be considered as closed (sani the identification of the harbor first made in Cuba, which is of less interest) by the reccnf labors of Lieut. J.B. Murdock, U. S. N. : "The Cruise of Columbus in the Bahamas, 149-2;" reprinted from No. 30 of thf' Proceedings of the U. S. NaYal Institute, Annapolis, Md., April, 1884. The land-fall took place urnloubte(lly at Watling's Island, as insisted upon by Captain Becher, in 1856, but iu attempting to trace the Bnbscqiient track he fell into au unfortunate error in eonseqnenM of the assumption of an extremf', value of the magnetic declination, supposed \Jy him to have prevaile.d at the time of Columbus's approach. The "Bird Rock" is the key to the track among the islands, aml thence tr:tcing the given courses and distances backwards, Watling's Islaud is readily and unmistakably reached as tho first land seen. t Soon after the discovery by Columbtls of a point of no variation in the Atlantic, Sebastian Cabot discovered a second one farther north and evidently belonging to the same agonic curve. Livio Sanuto states, in his (foographiea Distiucta (Venice, 1588), that he procured t.he information from Sebastian Cabot and made n8e of his map (probably that composed in 1544), ou which the position of the meridian intersecting the point of no variation was seen to be one hundred and ten miles to the wed of the island of Flores, one of the Azores; see "Narrative and Critical History ot' Ameriea," by Jllstin Winsor, Vol. III, Boston and New York, 1884, p. 41. This discovery probably was made on the second voyage of the Ca.bots, in 1498, although it may have been noted in the first, in 1497, by the !'Ider Cabot. The latitude of the point is uncertain, but may be approximat<Hi from the fact that in tho first ~·oyage laud was apparently sighted at Cape Breton, a.ud in the second the coast of Newfoundland (Baccalao:;), which is sa.id to have been made from the North. In tha course of a conversation with Contarini, the Venetian ambassador to Charles V, fo 152'2, Sebastian Cabot told the ambassador that he bad a method for ascertaining, by the ne.edlc, the distance between two places from tlllol!t to we&t, which had never previously been discoTered by any one. Ibid, p. 50.

In thill idea, however, he was also anticipated by Colllmbns. f Bulletin No. 5, published J nne 7, 1888.

These curves should not, be extended beyond the limits given them on the plate, but the formula is available for all places within the general area covered by the.'>e m1rves; south of the strait of Florida the curves change their character in consequence of the near approach but opposite sign of the numerical vnlues of the terms in 6 <p and in 6 qr; which sets a southern limit to the use· of the expression for D 1700 · It will he noticed that our cnr¥es and those of Halley agree well for west declination, also for east declination. I have already p"ointed out the difficulty of reconciling the observations made before 1700 with those after this epoch. During the next half century but few additional stations become available, and there is no gain in accuracy in the observed values (taken as before from our investigation of the secular variation) for the 19 i;tations submitted to treatment; Charleston had to be omitted since _30.s for 1750 proved inadmissable; our present tabular value is _30.1, and the value first computed was

The curves will be found laid down on the same plate (No. 23) which contains those for 1700; the change during half a century is thus directly exhibited. For the epoch 1800 our material bas become richer and precludes the need of such auxiliary expressions as those established for 1700 and 1750.

From the above table of epochs of extreme values we find, omitting the last station, the average iime 1803 or 1804, so that the agonic line for 1800 occupies very nearly the extreme uorthern position reached on our Atlantic coast, the small change between the years 1800 and 1803:! being unimportant. The bend near Harrisburg way be local or general. A comprowise poisition of this line is indicated on our plate No. 25. The agonic line for 1850 has heen taken from Coast Survey Report for 185G, Appendix No. 28, plate 61. The agonic hue for 1875 has been taken from Coast Survey Report for 1876, Appendix No. 21, plate 24, with correction of the northern part taken from the U. S. Lake Surrny, Pro· fessional Papers, Corps of Engineers, No. 24, plate XXX. The prospective position for 1900 depends on the isogonic chart for the epoch 1885, brought forward by means of the annual change deduced from our investigations.· The secular motion may be clearly apprehended from the several positions of the agonic line as given on the accompanying plate, No. 20, and as referred to in the preceding pages. We may remark that the change between 1600 or 1630 and 1700 should not be conceived as having been produced by a great sweep of the northern portion of the agonic curve across Europe and Africa, but rather as a gradual breaking through of the narrow neck of east declination in the vicinity of Cape Verde Islands, and thus readil.Y uniting with the previously existing southern branch of the agonic line, which, in 1600, skirted the southwestern coast of Africa. The isolated patch of east declination thus produced apparently drifted off to the eastward and northward.t Progreasive cltcr,nge in the secular variation.-The progressive change noticed when examining at different times the position of the lines where the needle has arrived at elongation or at extreme range in the secular motion bas already been referred to in a general way, and the systematic propagation of the phrase of eastern elongation across the United States, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, in about the lapse of a century, has been adverted to. Under the present heading it is proposed to enter somewhat more minutely into this remarkable phenomenon.
"Now (Ma.y, 1890) superseded by the iBSne in October, 1889, of a new isogonic cha.rt for the epoch 1890. t I find tha.t the ea.me idea wae presented by E. Walker in his Ada.me Prize Essay on ;\fagnetiMw for 186.'l; Cambridge, England, 1866. The reader's a.ttention may be directed to plate No. 43 of the new edition of Berghaus' Pbysikaliecher Atlas, Gotba, 1888; it is a convenient plate of reference to the secular motion of the isogonic curves, though no new featnr61! relating to North America are there presented.

The following figurf\s are taken directly from our table, column headed "Epoch of nearest east elongation," a,nd beginning geographically in the extreme northeast we fiml the years of the last occurrence of this stationary phase of extreme elongation or of minimum west or its equivalent maximum east declination, as the case may be, at different localities as follows:

·I'he opposite phase or that of the maximum west dt'cliuation is now located between Charlottetown and Ilalifax, and may be expected in its supposed westwarcl course to reach the latter place about 1804, Eastport, Me., auont 1897, and Portland, Me., about l!ll 7. Tbese places am! corresponding times suffice to bring into strong relief the gradual progress within our geographical borders of what may aptly be called the crest (or ho1low, as we may con· ceive) of the magnetic secular wave sweeping across tb(l North American continent in about a century's time. Since this transfer of the en-stern-elongation phase thus took place from east to west across the country, it is probable aud may reasonably be inferred that with the present passing out into the Pacific of the eastern-elongation phase and the coming in of the opposite or westernelongation phase in the east, this intrusion of the latter phase, already commenced in northeastern Maine, will likewise spread itself in the course of time over and across the continent; in fact our formulm do suppose tLis to take place. The question whether the secular motion of the easternelongation phase can be traced so far east as to reach Europe can uot he definitely answered. \Ve have for St" John's, Newfoundland, the date of 170!, and for Paris tbe year 1581, for the epoch of this phase, but unfortunately no intermelliate stations by means of which to follow up the motion and assure us of its continuity; observations at the Azores, in southern Greenland, and in Iceland may possibly come to light to assist in tliis inquiry. If we follow up the dates of the ea.stern magnetic elongation going south along our Atlantic coast, thence across the Gulf of l\Iexico and north along the Pacific coast, we notice the same law of gradual change a8 in our first table. A curve of equal date would fairls mn parallel to our Atlantic coast line, and hold even as far south as Ha\·ana and Panama; similarly a curve of equal date ou the Pacific coast from lower California up to the Straits of :Fuca would not greatly deviate from it.

Beyond Vancouver Island and as we enter Alaska the dates again become earlier, as at Sitka, 1861, and in the whole region to the northward and westward, and including the chain of islands, the average date probably varies between 1830 and 1850 or thereabout. Near the easteru coast of Asia, west of Kamchatka, we encounter a complex system of isogonic curves, whose secular development, however, lies outside the limits of our research. Looking over the numerical values of a, on which the length of the period depends, we notice a relation to geographical position, as also in the case of the epochal quantity c, of our general for. mula, the latter relation being less marked. For stations on our Atlantic coast the values a are generally included between l.30 and 1.50, impl.ving periods of 277 and 240 years respectively, and the same limits will apply to the generality of places in the interior. !<'or stations south of the United States the value of a is ·lecidedly less, as at Kingston, Baruados, Panama, Acapulco, City of ,\foxico, for which a varies lJetweeu 1.0 aml 1.1, with corresponding periocls of 360 and 327 ;years. Tile value of a for J>acific coast statiom:ii as San Diego, Santa Barbara, Monterey, San Francisco, and Ca.pe :\fondocino, remains low, averaging 1.10 (period 327 years); iu Alaska it rises again to about 1.30 (period 277 years), with but little variation as far as it can be ascertained . .At first sight this diversity in the length of the pel'iod would seem to 1)rese11t a great obstacle in the way of explaining the cause of the secular variation through the action of an external or cosmical disturbing force wbicb. wollld be supposed to act alike at all stations. If we suppose the changes in the direction of the magnetic needle to be due to changes in the direction of electric currents or of electric impulses or waves traversing the earth's crust and permeating the same to a considerable depth, and altering by inuuctive action the magnetic condition of the earth itself, we may see in the diversity of the length of the period, and of the magnitude of deflection at different places, the effect of a systematic swaying and mutual disturbing action in the direction and intensity of such electric currents. For the further development of the laws of sf>,cular variation in :~forth America it would be of great importance to know what has been and is at present going on in the immediate vicinity of the magnetic pole (where the dip is 900 and the horizontal force zero) since Ross visited the region now more than half a century ago. We have no direct or observational evidence whatever whether the pole remains stationary or has shifted its position, and if the latter, how much and in what direction.
EARLY ATTEMPTS TO LOCATE THE NORTH AMERICAN MAGNETIC POLE.

On a map in the Mercator-Hondius Atlas, Amsterdam, 1630,· and which is projected with the geographical north pole in its center, and is supposed by Dr. Kohl to be due to Gerard us Mercator, the magnetic pole js placed in latitude 740 and ou a line from the geographical pole to the Straits of Anian. t [Information extracted from" Bibliographical Contributions," No. 19, issued by Justin Winsor, Librarian Harvard University, Cambridge, 1886.) .A, v. Humboldt points out earlier attempts, which are also referred to by Mr. Winsor, viz: by Ruysch (about 1508), by Martin Cortez {about 1545), and by Liveo Sanuto (about 1588). The exact idea which was then attached to the term magnetic pole may remain a matter of conjecture, but we should remember that this was before the time the dip of the needle bad been discovered,t or had become generally known, and long before any real notion of magnetic intensity could be formed. On the map of the northwest coast, by C. de Judaeis, 1593, (copy No. 282 of the Kohl collection), the polus magnetis, on pinnacle rock, is placed in latitude 700 and in longitude of the myth· ical Anian regnum. [J. Winsor's B. C.] Although these early assignments of a definite location of the northern magnetic pole (where on the earth's surface tlie direction of the magnetic force and tbat of gravity coincide) are nothing more than fanciful conjectures, yet it is remarkable that these

guessNl should not have been so very far from the mark. Halley, in 1683, assumed that there were two magnetic poles in the northern hemisphere of different intensity and of vertical dip (and simi· larly two poles in the opposite hemisphere), an idea, which under a different aspect, wm; further elaborated by Hansteen (1819), wtio e\·en assigned long periods of rotation to bis poles. It bad then become known how to measure relati1·e intemdty, and a distinction was made between poles or foci of maximum total intensity aml poles of vertical dip (or of vanishing horizontal component of magnetic force). It is to this last conception that the term pole is now more exclush·ely applied. The focal region of greatest total intensity to the southward and westward of Hudson Bay is a very extended one, whereas the pole of dip ooo is restricted to quite confined limits, depending on local irregularities of distribution. Observations made in 1813 on board H. 1\1. B. Brazen place the pole in latitude U9° and in longitude 92° west; in J uuc, 1831 1 Sir James Clark !toss"' reached, iu latitude 70° 05'.3 and in longitude 9<P 45'.8 west, a position on Boothia Felix where be observed a dip of 89° 59', aud this location, or one not far from it, has ever since been regarded as that of the North American })Ole. According to Gauss's general theory of terrestrial magnetism (1838), this pole was about the year 1830 in latitude 730 35' and iu longitude 950 39' west of Greeuwich. Whether or not the pole has shifted its place t can not at present oe definitely decided, since Ross has as yet found no successor, though explorers in more recent times have Yisited the region for other purposes. In conclusion a few remarks may be made respecting the accuracy of the observations, shown by the tabulated probable errors and deri vcd from the differences of observed and computed values. The probable errors of observation given in the tables will serrn to convey some idea of the relative value of each series of observations. The imperfections in the instrumental meaus and methods of the older obser>ations in many cases react unfavorably on the modern observations, which are generally made with more precise instruments and using more refined methods. If we take, for instance, the observations of Hudson, made in 1609, in the vicinity of New York, we find Pach fairly chargeable with a probable error of about ::!:: 3 or 4°. While these observations are very imperfect, those of Champlain of about the same period ( 1604 to 1612) are no better. These two iiaNigators differ nearly 90 off the mouth of the Penobscot, .Maine, and nearly 12° off Cape Cod. The observations made by Vancouver on our western coast, between 1792 and 1794, are each subject to a probable uncertainty of at least ± 1 o, and even in our own days it requires ·ery favoraable circumstancL·s to determine the Yariation of the compass at sea with a 11robable Mror of, say, half a degree or less. At sea, increased precision was attained with the improvement of the azimuth compass aud by allowance for disturbing effect of the ship's iron, and as regards shore stations, greater accuracy was obtained by the introduction of the theodolite for determining the astronomical meridian. With a portable magnetornettr and a collimator magnet, the instrumental means need not, introduce a greater uncertainty than about one minute; but tile actual probable error uf auy determination is dependent also on the irregular variations in the direction of the rnaguetic force from day to day, thus making it desirable and indispensable for precise work to continue the observations for three or more days and to correct the individual results for diurnal variation. The amount of the probable error of an observed declination depends also on the intensity of the horizontal component of the magnetic force at the place, i. in general the smaller t4e horizontal force the larger the apparent probable uncertainty.

GEOGRAPHICAL POSITIONS OF TRIGONOMETRICAL POINTS IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT, DETERMINED BY THE U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY BETWEEN
THE YEARS 1833 AND 1886.
INTRODUCTION AND EXPLANATION OP THE TABULAR RESULTS.
By CHARLES A. SCHOTT', Assistant.

COMPUTING DIVISION, lllarch 18, 1889. The collection of geographical positions and of geodetic data resultiug from the triangulations made in the State of Connecticut, herewith presented, is iu continuation of the scheme of publishing tbe results of the Survey in those States where the field-work is substantially completed with respect to the immediate objects of the Surrny and where the triangulation could be made to rest on the standard geodetic data of the Survey. These data areThe unit of length.-The metre, and in particular the French <Jommittee metre brought to this country in 1803 by F. R. Hassler, afterwards first Superintendent of the Coast 8m,·ey. It is the property of the American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia. The length of Ibis standard will be compared with that o_f the new international standard as soon as its representative bar is received here. Tue difference in length between these metres is alread.Y known to be very small and only needs consideration when high scientific accuracy is inrnlved (see .App. 7, Rep. for 1867).· The geodetic surface of referenee.-The spheroid of rotation, most nearly conforming to the earth's figure and size, as deduced in 1866 by Captain A. R. Clarke, R. E., and which supertmded in February, 1880, the Besseliau spheroid, wnich had np to that time been used on the Survey. Its dimensions are:

The standard latitude.-Is that of the primary triangulation on the Atlantic coast, viz: Principio station <p = 39° 35' 36".692 (see A.pp. 8, Rep. for 1879). The standard lon9it'Ude.-Is that resulting from the telegraphic longitude system, connecting directly with Greenwich as the initial point; we have for Principio station .A = 76° 00' 16".407 west from Greenwich (see .App. 11, Rep. for 1884). ~ standard azimutk.-Is that of the primary triangulation, viz : Principio to Turkey statitlll a 0 = io 34' 3611.413 (see App. 8, Rep. for 1879). The preliminary results published in .Appendix 12, Report for 1851, Appendix 15, Report for 1864, and .Appendix 13, Report for 1868, are now superseded by reason of change of geodetic and astronomica.l data and for want of adjustment.

UNl'l'ED STATES COA8'f AND GEODETIC SURVEY

Hespecti11g elevations of stations above the average sea-level, the Survey is not at present in a condition to furnish them. Descriptions of stations, how marked on surface an<l below ground, can generally be given on application to the Office. The positions and connecting lines of all adjusted stations are shown on the accompanying map; all less important pointH are indicated by tlots. The sea.le of the map 3001<.00 is the same as that of the two sketches in Appendix 8, Report for 1885, of the triangulations of)\fassachusettsand Rhode IslarHL The method of treatment of the rct1uction of the observations is the same a~ that adopted for the States just named. The main triaugnhttion, entering Connecticut in the southwest, crosses the State, but the snboruinate triangula,tion of Long Island SounJ is tile principal support of the coast work. The adjuHtment of the seconuar,r triangulation of Lo11g fol and Souucl is shown in Appendix 8, Ueport for 1868, aud tlte dista,nces alHl angles there gi \·en are retained mmltcred. In a general way and sufficient for illustration we may explain the process of computing and of producing 1:iysternatic results as follows: The position of that particular trigonometrical station which is connected most strongly with tlJe main triangulation is first fixed uy adjustment, taking into conAideration the lines directed to it from primary stat.ions as well as lines di \'erging from it and intersecting the latter. Should there be more than one such point, say two or more, ha,ying equal strength of connection, they may ue treated together in one least.square atljustmeut. In this manner point after point or a Reries of such is adjusted in JlOSition, so that tile sum of the squares of the corrections to the obscrYcd horizontal directions s1mll be a minimum; the geometrical relations of the preceding points beiug always considered as fixed with respect to the variable elements of the new poi;;t or points nuder treatment. The princi[Jal secondary stations luwing thus become known in position, the tertiary })Ositions are determined in the same systematic though somewhat less elaborate manner than that followed for the secondaries, and generally without leas square adjm;tmcnt. The final result of this systematic treatment may be summarized by stating that uo discrepancy remaius in the results themselves, and that the length and direction of any side of a triangle may be computed from any starting side, aud through any series of connecting triangles, and ~·ct the same re1mlts will be reached. The latitudes and longitudes of the trigonometrical points were computeJ by the usual formulm, aided by the tables. ordinarily employed in the Sun'ey, for which see Appendix No. 7, Report for 1884. For primary sides, not exceeding in length (s) 100 or 150 kilometres (about 62 or 93 sfatute miles), the forrnnhP for difference oflatitude (L1 qi), diftereuce oflongitude (.dA), and difference of azimuth (L1ll'), are Yery accurate or sufficiently perfect for the purpose; these are:·

There also is sllown the inverse problem, viz, given <p and 1 and <p' and 1' (or <p gl an<l Lil) to finJ sand ll' and a'. This process may be used iu cases where the required distance and azimuths are not directly containe1l in the table of results.

The effoct of the earth's curvature may be estimated from the foot that the area of a triangle in latitude 40° having one 8econd (l") of spherical excess, is 76.060 square statute miles; in latitade 41°, 7G.07~ square statute miles, and in latitude 420, 7G.09G square statute miles. The shape of the triangle is of 110 consequence. To co1ffert squa,re statute miles into square kilometres we have the relations, 1 sq. st. mile = 2.589098 sq. km., and 1 sq. km. = 0.386101 sq. st. miles. For convenience of reference the positions ··re arranged in geographical groups after giving the primary, the subordinate primary and the secondary stations over the whole State. These · subdivisions are as follows:

Of these 817 points there are 58 outside the boundaries oftbe State, but repeated here for the purpose of showing the connection of the triangulation with those of thA adjacent States-Massa· chusetts, Rho< le Island, and New York.

* In connection with the State Shell-Fishery Commission.
·The whole nnmber of triangles formed and computed was 2251; the number of occupied trigonometrical stations within the State is 325. A number of computers was engaged on this work, buL the principal share of it fell to Mr. E. H. Courtenay, of the Computing Division, who supervised their work. The accuracy of the rl'sults is chiefly due to Mr. Courtenay, who spared no labor to render them as perfect as possil>le. These computations were made principally between the years 1883 and 1888. While the p-rimaries, subordinate primaries, aud principal secondaries possess all desirable accuracy, the minor secondaries and principally the earlier tertiaries, now over half a century old, are of somewhat inferior accuracy as compared with the same class of work in adjoining States. Modern work, however, greatly contributed to confine the eftect of any inferior part to narrow limits, and its accuracy may be estimated as twice that of the very oldest. Respecting the accuracy of a triangulation, the mean error m of an adjusted or resulting angle has been advantageously employed as a quantity of comparison for different triangulations by which to judge of their relative value (see e.g., Coast and Geodetic Survey Ueport for 1884, p. 389). The value m way be deduced in various more or less accurate ways, according to circumstances; in adjusted triangulations it may readily be deduced from - m=l.25J- 2-. ~ [c] n.s. Where :S [ c] is the sum of corrections to observed directions, n the number of conditional equations involved, and sthe number of directions in the adjusted figure; or, in unadjmited work, it ma~· be found from or, without squaring, from
m-l.25t

where e=triangle closing error (or difference from w+e), to be taken numerically without regard to sign in last formula., and t=number of triangles. We thus find for the adjusted triangulation H. Ex. 22-21

UNITED STATES UOAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

in the State the average value m=±5".9, likewise for the unadjusted triangulation m=±4''.8;
tltc deYiutions, howeYer, from this latter Yaluc are ycry great, rising and. falling between, sa;y, 4'' aucl 8'', accordiug to circumstances. 1-'he accuracy of the triangulation may otherwise he roughly expressecl in terms of the distance, and thus estimated, the average error of secondary "ork may he t'.1ken to range between 4 oto-0 aud 20-to- 0 of the length, whereas that of tertiary work barely comes up to Toho) and in parts may be as low as 5010- 6 of the length. There remain but a few words to be added explanatory of the table of results. Uolumn 1 contains the names of the stations, colu.!llu 2 the latitude, column 4 the longitude, columns 3 and 5 contain the equivalenls in metres of the seconds (in a.re). of latitude and longitude respectively, solely for the use of the draughtsman in projections ; column 6 gives the azimuth of the first to the second named station, counted from south rou.ud by west from 0° io 360°; it is followed by the reversed azimuth iu the next column. The distances are all referrml to the surface of the spheroid at tlrn average sea-level. Those who may prefer the English foot as the n11it of length can readily make the conversion from one unit into the other by means vf the following ta,bles :*

APPENDIX

No. 9.-1888.

TIDAL LEVELS AND FLOW OF CURRENTS IN NEW YORK BAY AND HARBOR.
Report by HENRY L. MARINDIN, Assistant.

U. S.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Wa.shington, Ma11 15, 1888. SIR: In the twelve sketches accompanying this paper, the attempt has been made to demonstrate graphically the movements of the tide in filling and draining tlle tidal reservoirs surrounding New York Oity. Thi;; project was rendered practicable by the extensive tide observations made in 1886 by the paTty of physical h;ydrogra.phy in my charge, anll by the completion of the lines of precise levels joining the tide stations, which were begun in 1886 and finished in 1887 by the parties
in charge of Assistant J.B. Weir, and Subassistant J. E. McGrath. · The sketches (illustrations Nos. 27 to 38 iuclusfre) represent vertical cross-sections of the height of the tide above or below the line of mean sea-le'\'"el for each lunar hour after the moon's transit, so that each sketch gives the state of the tide at intervals of about 62 minutes of civil time (12 of these intervals complete a revolution of the tide). The data shown on the sketches were obtained directly from the observations made at the tide stations. The reading of mean sea-level at Sandy Hook, which is taken as the datum line, was first computed for each tide-staff observed simultaneously, and after grouping the readings of the staff for 24 lanar hours, a mean difference in the height of the tide was obtained which eliminated the diurnal inequality for that day. This mean height, corrected for a mean tide, is the qnotation represented in the vertical sections. The datum line (mean sea-level) is represented by a, broken line joining t.he })oints where the tide-statls were loeated, and the surface of the water either above or below this plane is indicated by a full line. The shading of the vertical section is given in full lines (darker tone) above, and in broken lines (lighter tone) below mean sea-level, so as to convey to the eye without effort the stage of tide at tha.t time. . The readiugs of mean sea-level as derived from the tide obscrvatious were compared with those obtained from the precise leveliug, and it was gratifying to find such a close agreement as not to affect the result already obtained. The plus sign indicates above, and the minus sign below, mean sea-level. The quotation of the height is expressed in feet and tenths at th<; pln.ces where the tide-staffs were located. The general direction of the current is also in<licated by an arrow with the velocity expresse1l in feet per seoomL The velocity gh~en is that observed at the place and corrected for a mean tide 00Tre8ponding to tbat represente<l in the vet>tical sections.

l give below a tletailed description of the prominent features of the sketches. O lwitr-Moon.'s transit.-Tbis sketch shows an ebb stage throughout the area represented. The Lower Bay, the Upper Ela.rbor, the Kills with Newark Bay, and the western end of the Ea.st Uinr are below mean sea-level. Only that pa.rt of the East River to the eastward of Fourteenth. street, where the node is located, lies above the (latum plane..

UNITED STATES UOAST .AXD GBODETIC SUHVEY.

In the E.ast River between Ravenswood and Pot Coye, the surface slope is very decided, the difference of level being 1.95 feet in that short distance. The Hudson with the East Hivcr and Kill van Kull are pouring their waters into the Upper Harbor and out over Sandy Hook Bar. Pirst Jiour.-At this hour the waters are still ebbing o..-er the entire area. Saurl.v Rook ii'! now 1.80 feet below the datum plane; Governor's Island 1. 73 feet below the same. The nwaa sea-leYel node has move.d it1 the East ltivcr from Fourteenth street to Ha\'enswood, leaving the portiou to the eastward of the node still a hove mean sea-level. The slope between l{avenswoo!l and Pot Uove is slightly increased. The water-level is falling faxter than pre'dom;ly; at \'\'illets Point the fa! 1 has been 0.86 foot as against a fall of0.18 foot between the XI and 0 l10urs. Tlrn Hu<lson H.i\·er, Kill van Knll, and the East lti\·er are still dischargiug tlteir waters into the Upper Ilaruor a1ul through tlte Narrows over Sandy llook Bar, with an increm;ed velocity of current in the llndso11. Second hour.--:The surface oftlrn Lower Bay, the Upper Harbor, Kill van Kull, Newitrk Bay, and the Hudson with the East Hiver as far ai; Hell Gate, are all below the tlatnm plane; at S:m<l.r Hook 1.94 feet below, at Governor's Island 2.05 feet below. Iu the East River the node !ms worked slowly to the narrowest part of Hell Gate, all to the tJastward remaining aho,·e the datum line, although the water at the entrance into Long Island Sound has heeu falli11g fast., ('qnal to 1.95 feet since the first hour. A.II the streams are still discl1arging into the Upper llarLor; only that part of the East River east of College Point shows tile stream flowing east at tile surface, while the subcurrent is yet rn1rni11g towards the Upper Harbor. In the Hudson the strength of the current has increased, hut e,·erywherc else the current velocity has diminished. Third hour.-The entire water area is now found to lie below the datum plane. The title is rising in the Lower Bay and Upper Ilarbor while it is falling in N(jwark Bay and the Kills. Tlie surface of the East River throughout its length lies very nearly lcYel, with a slight deprexsion south of Hell Gate. The currents are now divided; to the westward of the Gate, the current is southerly, while to the eastward it is flowing towards the Sound. On Sandy Book Bar the current is northward, -very sligllt, and at the Narrows it isi mo,·ing in that direction near the bottom, while the surface is running south still. In Kill n,n Knll the current bas turned toward Newark Bay, but the Hudson and tllat part of. the East Ri\·er west of li{lll Gate are yet discharging into the Upper Harbor. Fourth lwur.-The ba,ys and streams are yet below the datum plane. At Sandy Hook thl' flood stream has filled up the Lower Bay till it is nearly at mean sea· level, beiug only 0.27 foot below that plane. The Hudson lies a little lower, while tl:.m Kills, Newark Bay, aull tlrn East Hiver lie still lower. While the Lower Bay anll Harbor have been filling up with the flood stream from seawnrd, the East River, althougll receiving a full tloml volume from tbe Up1>er Harbor, bas continued to fall \'er;y fast, so that at Willets Point the surface lies 3.13 feet below the datum plaue. The ·mrrente are more complicated at tliis hour; they are running northward from the sea over the Bar, and this direction is maintained as an under-current through the Narrows and up the Hudson, while the surface currents at these two places are flowing in the opposite direction. Throughout the East River the stream is moving eastwanl towards Long Island Sound. Fifth hour.-There is a change in the Lower Bay, the Upper Harbor, and in tbe llu<lson, in that they now appear above the datum plane, while half of the Kills, with Newark Bi1y aud twarl~' the whole of the East River, are yet below mean sea-level. Sandy llook is O.!J2 foot above datnm plane,Governor'tilsland is0.60 foot above; Newark Bay lies on an a\·erage 0.9foot below, aud the eastern end of th(l East River at Willets Poiut is 3.45 feet below datum. The currents are flood throughout with the exception of the surface stream in the Hudson which is still fl.owing Honth. The volume of water passing in at Sandy Hook is filling all the reservoirs and Bowing through the ast River into Long lsland S ound, which lies 4.37 n~et below the leYel at Saull.Y Hook. Sixth hour.-At, this honr all the reservoirs with the exception of that portion of the East River east of Fourteenth street lie above the datum 1ilane. 1 t is the reversed counterpart of tlrn conditions as they existed at O hour. In the Ea.st River the node is opposite Fonrteenth st.reet, the same point where it was at O hour, lmt with a nwersed stage on either side of it.

UNITED STATE8 t;OAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Sandy Hook lies 1.83 feet above mean sea-level; Governor's Island 1.30 feet above, while at Willets Point the water surface is 3.53 feet below the datum plarn. All the currents are the reverse of what they were at 0 hour, and the Hudson is now flood from surface to bottom. Seventlt ltour.-Tbe reservoirs, with the exception of part of the East Hiver,.lie above mean sea.level. Sitndy Hook is 2.14 feet above; Governor's Island 1.70 feet above, and Newark Bay averages 1.22 feet above. The node in the East River has moved very slowly from off Fourteenth street to the southern end of Blackwell's Island; all that part to the eastward lies below the datum plane, and at Willets Point the water surface is 2.69 feet below, so that this point is now 4.83 feet below the water-level at Sandy Hook. The currents are all northward and the western end of the sound is yet receiving a volume of water which has passed in at Sandy Hook. . Eighth hottr.-Again this is the reversed condition which obtained at the second hour; the neutral point is at Hell Gate. Sandy Hook lies 1.82 feet above datum plane; Governor's Island 1.90 feet above, and the eastern end "Of Long Island Sound is 0.50 toot below mean sea-level. The currents also are reversed" after substituting the condition at Kill van Kull for that at Old Ferry Point. Nintli Jwur.-Reversed conditions of the third hour. All the basins are above datum plane. Sandy Hook is 1.05 feet above, Governor's Island I.57 feet above, and Willets Point 2.05 feet above. The current has turned to ebb on Sandy Hook Bar, but the stream in the Narrows is still north, with the Lower Hudson a.nu western half of the East River flowing in the same direction. Newark Bay is discharging it:J waters into the Upper Harbor through Kill van Kull, and at tbe .east end of the Sound the stream is flowing towards Hell Gate where a depression is apparent. The water surface is falling rapi<lly in the Upper Harbor and Lower Bay. Tenth hour.-Reversed condition of the fourth hour as to height of tide; it is the restoration of mean sea-level in the Lower Bay on a falling tide as against the restoration of mean sea-level at the fourth hour on a rising tide. Sandy Hook is only 0.03 foot above datum plane, Governor's Island 0.66 foot above, and Willets Point 3.45 feet above. The stream in Kill van Kull and in the East River is flowing towards the Upper Harbor, part of which volume passes out through the Narrows, but the Lower Hudson still presents a high velocit~' northward although resting at a higher level, and it is evident that much of the water from the East River finds its outlet up the Hudson when we consider the high velocity of 3.60 foet per second at Nineteenth street, with 1.08 feet in the Hudson and only0.81 foot per second in the Narrows. Eleventh hoiir.-This honr precedes the moon's transit or 0 hour. The condition which obt.\ins at this time is a complete reversal of that at the fifth hour. The J,ower Bay and Upper lfarbor lie below mean sea-level Newark Bay, with adjacent parts of the Kills, lie above the datum plane and the East River largely above it. The directions of the currents are also reversed and the Hudson exhibits the same feature of tbe surface current moving in one direction while the .subcnrrent flows in the opposite direction. None of the sketches (drawn as they are to represent the stage of tide at the even hour) fall at the time of high or low water, but the stage of tide represented at the second hour is so near to the time of low water and that at the seventh hour so nearly the time of higl1 water that they can be accepted as representing those phases. It is not possible to enumerate the questions which might he advance41 or solved by the study of the data contained in these sketches. If they were no more valuable than in aiding the study of the qu~stion of the re8pective values of the ba.ys and Ila.ts as tidal reservoirs in maintaining the channel ways through S:iudy Hook Bar, they would then have repaid the tinw aud labor spent io preparing them. Tbey are offered as a progressive step in the study of the physical condition of the movements of the tides aud currents which sarround the principal commercial city of the United States.

HEJGiiTS FROM SPIRIT-LEVELING OF PRECISION BETWEEN MOBILE, ALA., AND OKOLONA, MISS.
Observations by J.B. "WEIR, Assistant, and J.E. McGRATH, Suhassistant, in 1884, 1886, and 1"<>-l7. l~eport hy CHARLES A. SCHOT'r, .A.ssistant.

COMPUTING DIVISION, CO.A.ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

September 28, 1888. DEAR Sm: I herewith respectfully submit a report on the results of spirit-leveling of precis. 'ion between Mobile, Ala., and Okolona, Miss., 1884-'~6-'8i. Rouw line of levels.-The line follows the Mobile and Ohio Railroad throughout., and was ·mbdivided in four parts, viz: rtfobile to Citronelle, Ala., leYeled in 1884; Citronelle to Quitman, Miss., in 1887, Quitman to Meridian, Miss., in 1886, and Meridia11 to Okolona in 1884. The respective lengths of the parts are as follows: 53.7, 123.~ 42.6 and 204.2 kilometres or 33.3, 76.4, 26.5 and 126.9 statute miles; total development, ,i23.5 kilometres, or 263.1 statute miles. The bench-mark at Mobile was connnected with the average tidal level of the Gulf of Mexico, at Biloxi, Miss., as reported by ine August 4, 1887.· Observers and dates of levelings.-The line from Mobile to Citronelle was leveled b~- Assistant J. B. Weir between February 18 and March 6, 1884; the part from Citronelle to Quitman was leveled by J. B. Weir and Sub-assistant J, E. McGrath between .fanuary 19 and March 2~, 1887; the part from Quitman to Meridian by J.B. Weir between April 19 and May 12, 1886, and the last part, from Meridian to Okolona, by the same observer between March 8 and May 5, 1884. lnstruments.-Three instruments were employed; for the first and last parts spirit-level No. 1 (described in Appendix ll, Report for 1880); for the second part spirit-levels Nos. 2 and 3 (described in Appendix 15, Report for 1879), and for the third part No. 3 alone. The inequality of collars was as follows: Object end larger ( +); all observations hy J. B. Weir.

Coefficient of expansion of brass, 0.000010 for 10 Falu., or 0.000018 for 10 C. Method of observing.-The method pursued in 1884 was that of running two simultaneous and par· all.:il lines, as descrihetl iu Appendix 11, Report for 1880; altcruat~ isections of the line were run in the sense of forward and hack ward direction; average distance from staff to staff about 225 m.; when .setting the telescope for'' horizon" th~ bubble was either made to play in the middle or one end of it was set to a fixed graduation line. In 1884, experience .on another line having shown the insnfficiency of the method heretofore followed, it was subsequently changed to that ofrunniug two independent lines, one forward, the other backward. In 1887, spirit-level No. 2 was used for the backward line by McGrath, and No. 3 for the forward line by Weir. The distances between the staves in 1886 and in 1887 averaged about 190 m. The instrumental manip· ulation was the same as described in the leveling by the same party about New York Bay and Harbor in 1887 (Appendix No. 14, Report for 1887). Computations a.nd results.-The field computation was furnished by the observer; the second or office (and check) computation was made by L. A. Bauer, of the Computing Division, who was aided in the 1884 computations by Subassistant C. H. Van Ordeo, then temporarily assigned to the Computing Division. These reductions were made in accordance with the printed forms prepared for them, and include all needful corrections together with the computation of the probable errors of the results. In computing the latter, the probable errors depending on the comparison of parallel simultaneous lines were increased by one-fourth of their value in order to render them, as near as may be, comparable with the values derived from independent lines. The tabulllr form of the results is the same as that adopted for similar work in preceding reports; the distances between the bench-marks are given in kilometres, and their heights ahove the average Gulf level are stated in metres. The partial and the total accumulated dis· crepaucies are given in millimetres.

Accuracy of tlte preceding res1tlts for heights.

Tbe observed differences of heights resnlting from th11 forward and backward independent measures of a number of bench-marks in the line of levels, are made the basis, as usual, for the determination of the probable errors of the assigned heights of these marki;;, and they serve also for a general measure of the accuracy of the whole operation. In the latter case, the average probable error in tlie resulting difference of heigl1ts is referred to the kilometre as the unit of length, and, in accordance with the method of least squares, the probaule error of leveling is taken to be proportional to the square root of the length of line, or otherwise expressed, the weight w of a result is inversely proportional to the distance s. Let d = dift'e.rence in the results from two independent measures, one forward, the other backward, in direction, for any mark at the distance s. It is customary to express din millimetres ands in kilometres. n = the number of such differences or the number of separate lines making up the whole distance. m, and _m 11 = the mea.n square error of a single leveling and of a double leveling, respecfrrely, in one kilometre, or for a unit of length; then

For comparison, we had for the line Mobile, Ala., to New Orleans, La., 1885-'86, m,=.:l: l.4omm, and for the line, Sandy Hook, N. J., to Dobbs' Ferry, N. Y., 1886-'87, m,=::l:2.33mm. The total resulting probable error of leveling between Biloxi and Okolona is equal to

V (7.::l)2+(ti.J)2 + (8.7J:i+(4.7J 2 +(1i.5)2 =± ts,5mm,
This probable error is less than that adopted for the average tidal leV'el of the Gulf water, which was .:!:25.omm; the probable error of the resulting absolute height of Okolona is therefore

The acc111nulated discrepancies, either between the results by two staYes or between the forward and backward measures, remain reasonably small, the maximum amount in each of the four sections being +10.0, -32.5, +22.1 and +u.Gmm. In the last ease, the gap between the E and F lines of levels just reaches lJt inches, which is the maximum departure in the whole line.

HEIGHTS FROM SPIRIT-LEVELING OF PRECISION BETWEEN NEW ORLEANS, LA., AND WILKERSON'S LANDING, MISS., OPPOSI'rn AltKANSAS CITY, ARK.
Levelings between Carrollton (New Orleans), La., aml Greenville, MiAA., executed by 0. H. TITTMANN and ANDREW BRAID, ABsistant8, and J. B. WEIR, Subassistant, 1879-1881. LevelingH between Gri'envill<1 and Wilkerson's Lauding, Miss., opposite ArkanRaR City, Ark., executed under direction of the M1ss1ssIPPI RIYER COMMisSIOX by J.B. JOHNSON, ASlliRtant Engineer, 1880-'81.

Report on reduction of' observations and re·mlts by CHARLES A. SCHOTT, Assistant.

COMPUTING DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE~

December 29, 1888. The results of spirit-leveling of precision from New Orleans (or Carrollton) up tbe Mississippi River to Wilkerson's Landiug,Miss., are here presented in fi"Vesections for convenience of reference. Respecting descriptiou of instruments, their adjustment, and tlrn method of using them, it suffices to refer to Appendices N o.15, Report for 1879, by Assistant Tittmann, and to N o.11, Report for 1880, by Assistant Braid. The field computation waR made by the observers, and the office computation by Mr. A. S. Christie and Mr. H. Farquhar; the compilation and reduction to sea-level is due to Mr. L. A. Bauer. Other particulars are given at the head of each section, but for the discussion of the probable errors of the resulting heigh ts for each part and for the whole line from Biloxi, Miss., to Little Rock, Ark., the reader is referred to the next following Appendix No. 12, in which the levels are continued to Little Rock. The route of levels follows the levees of the river and is sub· divided as follows: 1. From Carrollton, to Red River Landing, La. The line of levels starts from the benchmark at Carrollton, which is connected by levels with Biloxi, Miss. and where the average leYel of the Gulf of Mexico is ta.ken up, foUows tlie eastern bank of the river up to near Raton Rouge, near which place it crosses the Missii-sippi and continues thence on its western side to Red River Landing. The elevation above the average sea or Gulf level of the Carrollton bench-marks will be found in Appendix No. 91 Report for 1887. 2. From Red River Landing to Biela's Landing, La., opposite Rodney, Miss. The route is along the western side of the river, with a branch line across the river to connect with Fort Adams, Miss. 3. From Biela's Landing to Milliken's Bend, La., above Vicksburg. The line continues on the western side of the river. 4. From Milliken's Bend to Greenville, Miss. The line crosses to the east side at Tennessee Landing below Providence, La., and continues on that side to Greenville. 5. From Greenvi1le to Wilkerson's Landing, Miss., opposite Arkansas City. The route from Greenville lies on the eastern bank and again crosses the river near Arkansas City whence it fol· lows the railroad toward Little Rock, as stated in detail in the next appendix.

The stone is in southwest corner of field, 1 metre back of old levee, 25 metres north of new levee, which marks the boundary between Bolivar and Washington Uounties, and is therefore in Bolivar County, Miss. Top of bolt is 4 millimetres above top of stone. B. M. 85.-Is top of brass bolt in top of stone post, set in southeast corner of yard on Thomas S. Kennedy's plantation (John Graves, lessee) at Port Andersou, Bolivar County, Miss. Stone is 25 metres east of a brick cistern at southeast corner of house, and 40 metres southeast of a brick cistern at northeast corner of house. It is 55 metres back from levee, and about 160 metres above rin abrupt turn in levee. Top of bolt is 5 millimetres above top of stone. B. M. 84.-U. 8. Engineer's description, 1880-'81.-Is top of brass bolt in stone post, set on Lewis Clark's plantation, 1,tOO metres below Wilkerson's Landing, Bolivar County, Miss. Stone is just inside of fence, 15 metres back of levee, 10 metres northwest of hom1e of Daniel Braxton (colored), 20metres north of woods which extend to Port Anderson, some3 miles below. Top of bolt is 5millimetres above top of stone. U. O. <t G. 8. ~aription, 1887.-Is the top of brass bolt in stone post on Mr. Rigley's plantation, which had changed ownership since the above description. The stone was found to be outside of fence, 15 metres back of levee and 10 metres northwest of house, occupied now by Benjamin <Jole. It is about 6 inches square, projecting 6 inches above the surface of the ground, and has the letters U.S. carved in its upper surface. Top of bolt was found to he ouly 2 millimetres above top of stone with no indication that it had been broken off or tampered with. N. B. The data for judging of the accuracy of the levels and the probable errors of the resulting heights will be found in the next appendix, No. 127 l{eport for 1888, where the line is carried as far as Little Rook, Ark.

CmfPUTING DrnsroN, CO.A.ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

,fuly SO, 1888.

DEAR Sm: I here\"\'ith respectfully submit a report on the results of the spirit-leveling of preci,;ion between Arkamms City (on the Mississippi Ri>er) and Little Rock, Ark., 1887-'88. Route of levels.-Tl..te line starts from a hench-mark of tlie Mississippi River Commission opposite Arkansas City, Ark., which is about 18 statute miles above Greenville, Mi:ss., and follows the Little Rock, Mississippi Ri·er and Texas Railroad to Little Rock. The total development of the leveling is 184t kilometres or I H~ statute miles. Observer and date of leveling.-The liue from opposite Arkansas City to Little Rock was leveled by J.E. McGrath, .Snbassistant, aided by .J. Nelson, Aid, between October 24, 1887 antl February 22, 1888. Instrmnen,ts.-Geodetic spirit-level No. 2 was used for the whole line, also for the crossing of the Arkansas River at Little Rock, but the crossing of the Mississippi River was effeeteAl by means of levels Nos. 2 and 3, used simultaneously. These instruments are described in Appendix No.15, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1879, and figured on plate :So. 52. Rods A 1 aud B were used; their constru('.tion is shown in the same Report, ph1te No. 53. The instrumental constants are essentially the same as given in full in my re1lort on the leveling about New York Bay and Harbor (Appendix No. 14; Report for 1887) except that a new eye-piece of lower power (:!4) was fitted to instrnment No. 2, September, 1887, likewise one to No. 3 on the same date, power 25, and a ne\I' striding level was placed with No. 3, scale value 3" ,9 (October 1887). For instrument No. 2 we have, accordingly: Value of 1 div. striding level, 3".37; value of 1 turn of micrometer screw, 257".5; angular value of telemeter threads, 161 3911 .3; collar inequality as determined by J.E. McGrath at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office September 19, 1887; object end collar larger 1".490, and after the leveling in Arkansas by the same observer, at St. l,ouis, Mo., February 22 and March 26, 1888, object end collar larger l1'.H6 and 0".900; mean=l" .023, the difference being due to wear during the field operation. The metric rods A 1 and B are of standard length at rn:i.4 C. (07°.o Falir.) and 220.1 C. (710.7 Fabr.) respectively. Index correction of rod A 1 as found at Little Rock before the field-work commeuced, 79mm,3, and after its completion 73mm.2, and for rod B was found similarly 79.3 and 7gmm.2, the rods being of equal length and wearing alike. Meth-0d Qf observing.-The whole line was independently leveled in a forward direction by one of the observers anti in a backward direction by tl.ie second observer. As usual with our instru455

ments of precision, the difference of height between the staff readings depends on the micrometer screw, the "horizon n reading being taken with the bubble of the ether level in the middle of the tube; collimation of line of sight and optical axis is secured at each station bJ- observing with telescope direct and inverted (turned 1800 about a horizontal axis); the average distance between the staves was ahont 210 metres, the instrument beiug mounted midway bet'l"l"een. The general manipulation at each station of tlie instrument is drscrihed in Appendix No. 11, Hcport for 1880, with the exception of the modification of but one line being run at the time, iustead of two simultaneous parallel lines. In crossing the Mississippi River, 23 measures of the difference in height of the marks on each bank were taken simultaneously by two instrmnents, on two days, and at various hours. The distance across the river was 1129 metres. Computations.-The field computation was made by the observer, the office computation by F. M. Little, and the reduction-tables and revision by L.A. Hauer. These reductions were made on the printed forms provided for levels of precision and include the computation of the probable errors of the results. Resulting elmiations.-They are here given in the usual form; the initial plane of reference is , the average level of the Gulf of Mexico as observed at Biloxi, Miss. (for particulars see my re])Ort of .August 4, 1887,* on reimlts of leveling between Mobile, Ala. and New Orleans, La., 1885-'86). Jn order to get the height of the starting mark, the result of the spirit-levels between Greenville, Miss., and bench-mark No. 84, as determined bJ the :Mississippi River Commission in 1880-'81, had to he added to the height of the Greemille mark, at the Bank Building, this being the terminal }l()int on the river of the Coast and Geodetic Survey levels. We ham the following data:

Equal to 137.926 feet. The precise levels between Biloxi and bench-mark No. 84, opposite Arkansas City, were executed by the Uoast and Geodetic Survey, with tile exception of the short distance hetween Greenville, Miss. and bench-mark No. 84 below Wilkerson's Landing, Miss., which was done under the direction of the :Mississippi Hiver Commission. Further 'particulars respecting the character of these operations will be found further on in connection with the discussion of the probable error of the result.

Accuracy of the preceding results for heights.
The accuracy of a measure being inversely proportional to its mean or to its probable error, we shall consider the latter for each of the separate lines connecting the Gulf level with the height of Little Rock, Ark. The probable error of leveling is based upon the discrepancy between the results of the forward an1l of the backward operations for the various bench-marks in the line, and although not representing the whole probable error in consequence of the presence of unknown constant errors which come out only at check crossings of independent lines of levels, we have at present no other means of a more rigid determination. Let r, and r11 equal the average probable error of a single and of a double leveling (forward and backward independently), respectively, for unit of length or for one kilometre. Hence

r = 9.675 d]and 1 v2n s Also, let r equal the pro liable error from double leveling of a line of length l, between initial and terminal marks expresseu in kilometres. Then

DIFFERENTIAL METHOD OF COMPUTING THE APPARENT PLACES OF STARS FOR DETERMINATIONS OF LATITUDE.
By E. D. PRES'l'ON, ARsistant.

PREFATORY NOTE.
COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 0F.FlCE,

Washington, December 17, 1888. In the computation of the latitudes of fourteen stations occupieu during the year 1887, Mr. E. D. Preston, Subassistant, found it desirable to shorten the labor of computing the apparent declinations of the stars observed, and for this purpose made a.n investigation looking to the introduction of a. differential method. This method, upon application, he found superior to the logarithmic one, saving both time and labor in computation. It has boon deemed well, therefore, to present an account of it in this appendix.

DIFFERENTIAL METHOD OF COMPUTING THE APP4RENT PLA.CES OP STARS FOR LATITUDE WORK.

When a number of stations have been occupied during a season for the determination of latitude, the necessary reduction of the stars from mean to apparent positions requires considemblc time. With the view of accomplishing the task sooner as well as making the work much lei,;li laborious, and at the same time having an accuracy fully equal to the requirements of the case, the following investigation was made. Although the superiority of this method is most marked when the observations extend over only three or four days, and when several stations with long star lists are to be reduced at one time, yet in any case it is considerably shorter than the usual logarithmic method. Little is gained by observing a star more than three times; and with the improved mean star places now available and allowing a probable error of observation of 0" .50 for an experienced observer, three evenings' work will reduce the uncertainty of the latitude to a.bout 10 feet. So that this method may be employed nearly always with great advantage. The computation of the ap1la.rent places of stars for the dates of observation may be abridged in two ways; first, in using Orelle's tables instead of ma.king the usual four-plaee logarithmic computation, and, second, after having one date getting a neighboring date by the application of dif. ferential quantities derived from the usual formulre.

If we consider the tabular differences of the quantities that vary with the date as the differential co-efficients of the quantities with respect to the time at the date already computed, we have the following formulw as representing the change in declination between the two dates :
-gdG sin (G+a)+dg cos (G+a) [-kdll sin (Il+a)+dh cos (Il+a) J sin di cos 0

o

The following relations exist between the independent star numbers: B g=s1n G

h=-sin H

0

Where the letters have the signification given in the American Ephemeris, K is the precession CODAtant 2011 .0533. The greatest departure from a uniform change for a 5-day period in B and .A. is due to terms depending on the moon's longitude. The terms depending on the longitude of the sun, of the moon's ascemling uode, aud on the longitude of the sun's and moon's perigees, being either quite regular for a 5-day period or else being extremely small. In 1887 G does not change as much as 30; g changes less than 0" .5. The tan of H varies inversely as the tangent of the sun's mea.n longitude. Hence H varies nearly uuiformly throughout the year, changing a.bout 10 daily. h depends on the same quantity and has its maximum values at the solstices and its minimum oues at the equinoxes. For a 5. day period it departs little from a uniform change. i varies also with the sun's longitude and has its maximum with the minimum h and vice versa. The greatest daily change in i is not much more than 0' 1.10, while that of h is very much less. The value of'G is in general principally affected by changes in terms depending on the sun's aml moon's longitude and on the longituue of the moon's ascending node. The latter has a daily motion of 3'. The first two have a daily motion of about 1° and 13°, respectively. Tan G varies uirectly as Band inversely as .A., and since the former depends on the cosines and the latter on the sines of the above functions, they do not both change rapidly at the same time. At 900 oos b.l cbanges .005 in five days and the charige in cos 2.Q may be neglected. When 0 =450 cos 20 has a change of .087. For an equal period and position cos 2 ([changes about 1 unit. The terms in which these quantities enter will therefore vary by 0".05, 0".05, and 011 .09 respectively. Hence the greatest change in B comes from the change in the moon's longitude. In case of all these changes having their maximum at the same time, and tending in the same direction, the value of B would only be changed by about one-fiftieth part of itself, and since a tan-1

Y=i;

y2 the change

in G dependent on B will not be more than about 10. '1.'he longitude of the moon's ascending node does not pass through 900 until 1890, but itB ehauge is slow com pared with that of the others, and in its relation to B, we need not for the present consider its effect on G. The above quantities enter A as a sine function with co-efficients about one-twentieth of those for B, but the precession factor appearing in the denominator of tan G, makes the changes in numerator and denominator about equal for maximum values of the fnuction. But G being deter· mined by its btugeut the magnitude of its changes depends also on the absolute values ofB and A, for when ll is small a given change in A has very much more influence on the angle. In general we may expect changes in G of less than a degree }>er day. When we liave very small values for B, as in 1890, and also very small values for .A., as in May, a combination of these may give changes in G for five days, amounting to300 or more; but, as will be shown later, this does not render the method inapplicable. When B has its largest value, G does not change more than, say, 5°, which reduces the product of dg by dG to a quantity less than 0".10, and when dG is very Iargfl dg is small enough to reduce the product oonsidcrably under 11 0 .IO, so that in general we may estimate the neglected term to be less than 0''.10. The product

of any two of these differences that actually occur together is usually only a few hundredths of a second, so that the method will 8atisfy all the re11uirements of the latitude work. These considerations show that the star's position may be derived with all necessary accuracy by tho application of differential quantities, when the difference between the two dares is not more than five days. The following two forms show the reduction by both methods. It will be noticed that the method by difforences involves only about half the number of figures used in the logarithmic method, besides requiring very little mental laLor:

Explanation of computation.
In both methods the quantities below the double lines are the same for all stars, varying only with the date, and are therefore written but once. The first computation is the usual logarithmic one and needs no explanation. The second is by Orelle's tables and differences. In the first column are the natural trigonometric functions. In the second are the quantities g cos (G + a), lt cos (H +a) sin o, and i cos o, the sum of whichisthereduction toapparentplaceforJanuary20. The third column contains the products of the constant multipliers by the corresponding sines aml cosines to obtain the following quantities of the differential equations:
- gdG sin (G +a') +dg cos (G+a)

I- lulII sin {Il+a) +dh cos (IT+a)] sin o
di cos 0
It should be stated that, dG and dH are first reduced to linear quantities. The sum of this last column, omitting the two middle Yalues, gives the quantity to be applied to the reduction for J~muary 20 to obtain that for January 25, and will in most cases be found to be correct within one or two hundreths of a second. The method of differences is considered to be a saving of about one-half the usual time, besides being very much easier; as many as 30 pairs being computed for two dates in about seven hours by a person familiar with the method. After the com1mta.tion of the first date the oorrec-

tions to be applied to these to get thmm for the second date were found in two hours. But in onler to work advantageously, each step is taken up systematically and carried through the eutire number of pairs; arnl often two steps may be carried on simultaneously where the multipliers arc simplo or the tables kept open two places at once. Care should b(l taken to avoid using more places than ·are necessary. For example, in the direct computation for the first date, three figures are sufficient except where h enters. It is not considcrf'd essential to secure exactly the fourth place bcrc, but it may be done with Crelle's tables mentally and with very little labor by taking the ncar<'st unit in the thinl place aml 1tpplj'ing to the prOLluct the :ilgebraic sum of the units place by the thousandths-one, or two places at most, l>eing considered. In forming the products for the differences two places only 1ieed generally he retained. The difference of 0".03 between that calculated rigorously for January 2;; and that derived by the forrnulm is due to the fact that the diffcrenceR have been treated as differentials and not as finite differences. The neglected product dh, dU, sin (II + £1') does not amount to more than 0.003, and need not be regarded even when sin o is as much as 0.90, for, as a, rule, stars are not observed above G50 declination. If we hail treated the difference in the cosine of (TI+ a) as a finite difference, using the formula - 2 sin (X + i.JX) sin ~.JX instead of - sin XdX, the agreement would of course ha\·e beeu perfect; the essential points in the metb01l being that the differences are considered as differentials and the term inYolving the product of the differences is ueglected. It might be snpposeil that if we have a difference of 0".03 in the position of a star for a difference in H of, say, 5° that this (liscrepancy wotlld amount to a quantity entirely inadmissible in the case ofG in May, 1890, where the difference is upwards of 30°; but since the tan of G varies directly as ll, and since when these excessi\'e changes in G oecnr, B is necessarily quite small because the longitude of the moon's ascending node is near 90°, the discrepancy between the values of g cos (G + a) calculated by the differential formulm and those by actual multiplication does not much exceed that in the present case, in fact, they only differ by 0".05. Indeed, the large discrepancy in the present case is due to the fact that the error committed in neglecting the formula for fil!_ite differences must be multiplied by h, which increases it twenty fold; g in the extreme case of 1890 is 0.8, hence only one twenty.fifth of Ti for this case. But the tliscrepaney for the valumi of May, 1890 comes from another source, viz, from the product of the two differentials dg and dG and even then will only occur for a few pairs where (G + a) is near 900, and hence the sine is large. It will be noticed that assuming a value for (G + a) which gives the most rapid change in the cosine also gives a large value for the sine and hence increases the value of the term dg sin (G+a) dG; and that there is a combination of circumstances tending to increase our discrepancy to 0" .08. This may readily be neglected when we consider that the probable errors of the declinations of the individual stars are several times as large. ln general the errors introduced by this method are quite insignificant, even admitting tlle declinations to be absolutely true. Besides, for the extreme case of 1890 we have assumed a value for (G+a) which would give the greatest possible change in the cosine for the change in Gunder consideration, viz, a value extending from about 85° to 105°. Moreover, since this term depeuds on the star's right ascension, for any station this extreme cast: would only apply to a few pairs which involved values of (G+a) passing through the points 90° or 270°, no night's work ever lasting long enough t.o pass through or even near them both. When the observations do not extend beyond five days the last date is derived from the first by differences. For work extending over a period of from five to fifteen days, the middle date is actually computed and the first and last computed by differences. Where on a-0count of bad weather, observations are very much scattered, it is better to make separate computations for each date. Under ordinary circumstances, three successive nights are all that are required, which involve differences in the star numbers for only two days; in this case the result by differences will be found to be identical with those of a rigorous calculation. For where dG ancl dH are about 2° and dg and dk one or two tenths, their product does not affect the hundredths place, and the change in the cosine of au arc, whether computed as a differential or a finite difference, is practically the same for dilferences of arc of 20, the discrepancy never amounting to a unit in the hundredth place.

DETERMINATIONS OF LATITUDE AND GRAVITY FOR THE HAWAIIAN
Ily E. D. PRESTON, ARsistant.

U. S. CO.A.ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, ~Washin9ton, July 8, 1889.
DEAR Sm: I have the honor to transmit you to-day my report on the observations and computations made for the Hawaiian Government. This report is somewhat fuller in illustration aml in detail than would have ueen necessary, had it been made on work done in this country and written only to appear in the annual Coast and Geodetic Survey Report, several sketches and one or two forms of computation being intro· dnced which have already appeared in our Reports, but which it was thongllt best to give, inasmuch as many persons who will read tlie report have not access to the Coast Surn.>y publications. In a letter recently received from Surveyor-General Alexander, he says the;r look with great interest for the appearance of the report. The results are, moreover, of general scientific intl'\rest. Professor Dana says (American Journal of Science, February, 1889, page 87): "They afford unexpected evidence on these doubtful points" (density of volcanic mountains). The addition of relative forces of gravity at eight new stations to foe data alread.r existing furnishes considerable matter bearing on the determination of the earth's figure, especially as these stations have a range of about 50 degrees in latitude and 10,000 feet in elevation. The lengths of the Peirce pendulums are published here for the first time. In view of the above statements I beg leave to ask you whether this report could not be made special and published immediately. The Hawaiian Survey could then have their copies without delay. I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NOTE ON HAWAIIAN PRONUNCIATION.

As some native words necessarily appear in this report, in order to aill tliose readers who may not be familiar with the Polynesian languages the following remarks are made: Two iuva. riable rules lie at the foundation of Hawaiian pronunciation; every word must end with a vowel

and no two consonants arc pronounced without an intervening vowel. When the missionaries retluced the lauguage to writing, about 1820, they adopted the Latin pronunciation. Each character represeuts hut one sound, so that the language is entirely phonographic. The vowels are then to ham the sounds gfren them in the Romance languages (except u, which bas the sound given it in Spanish and Italian, and not that of the Frcncli), and the consonants are in general close approximations to the corresponding ones in those languages. A. few exceptions exist, arising from the inability of the early Hawaiians to distinguish between t and k and l and r. The word for star is pronounced indifferently "hoku" or "hotu," and tlle French travelers, in 1819, wrote Onorourou for llouoluln. As the missionaries found only two words in the language ha,·ing the sound of d, viz, "hido" and "lido,'' this sound in t.hose words is replaeed by th(l sound of l in the Hawaiian of to-day. Although two consonants may not appear together, any number of vowels are allowable, :rn, for example, in the words Pakaoao and IIooiaioia, nud in the sentence "E a{l au ia oe." The accent is generally on the pcnult, as in Honolulu, Kohala, Kahnku, etc.

REPORT.

The latitude and gravity observations made for the Ilawaiian Go.,ermnent during the year 1887, may be said to have had their origin in the determination of a latitude ou the island of Maui in 1883. Two members of the United States Solar Eclipse Expedition stopping here on t11eir way lwme, in order to determine the force of gravity at De Freycinet's station of 1819, furnished the Government Survey with a value of the latitude of Lahaina which differed 1511 from that derived from Honolulu, anu based on the English observations of 1874. In order to test the astronomical observations at the two extremities of the triangulation, Prof. W. D. Alexander, the :Sur\""eyorGeneral of the islands, at once conceived the project of having a number of latitudes of precision determined, which should not only inclncle Maui, but all the larger islancls. Owing, however, to lack of appropriations, this plan could not be immediately realized, and it was not until 1886 that a formal request was made by the Hawaiian Government for the loan of the necessary instruments, and tlie detail of an observer to execute the work. The following letter states the conditions under which the work was undertaken:

THORN,

Superintendent·

The sc11eme proposed by :ProfesEmr Alexander contemplated the occupation of fourteen lati· tude stations, of which three were on Kauai, three on Oahu, four on Maui, and four on Hawaii. llut as the object of the observations was the determination of the deflections of the plumb-line, and as this depends on the density of the mountains, it was thought advisable to supplement the latitude work by some measurements of the force of gravity. Therefore the original plan was extended 80 as to include pendulllm observations on the summit of Haleakala, Maui, at a station near the sea-level of the same island and at Honolulu. This last station was also occupied in 1883, which gives a connection between De Freycinet's station and all the stations of 1887.

In dew of the general scientific interest in the question of plmnh-line deflections, tlte Hawaiian Government waR led to ask, through the Honorable II. A. P. Carter, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Washington, that the obserrntions might be r(lduced aml discussed according to modern methods by the <Joast and Geodetic Survey. The matter was taken up ip1mediately, and the computations begun on January I, 1888. In addition to these rednctiom, the length and position of the center of mass for each pendulum 11as been determined, a hulletiH* l1as been published giving some preliminary results of the work, and some original inYestig<itions made for the sake of shortening the m<>tholls of reduction. 'fo this report are also appended the results of pendulum obsen·ations at three continental stations occupied in 1887, and three island stations occupied in 1883. The former heiug all in tlle same journey, and the latter beiug occ11pied b,y one of the same ohservers and using the same instrument, and tlie two journeys having two stations in common, they naturally fall in the same series and should appear together. Professor .Alexander was present at Puuloa and on the summit of Haleakala. Messrs. F. S. Dodge and W . .A. Wall, of the Government Surve,y, took part in the pendulum obser>atious at tbl' three island stations, and Mr. Wall was with the party during the entire season and recorded tl1P latitudes. Mr. Dodge recorded part of the obRen·ations at Kahuku, aml .Mr.·T. S. Emerson part of those at Ka Lae. .All the time and latitude, and one-half the pendulum ohscryations, were made by myself. .At San Francisco l was assisted b.r Mr. 0. Il.

Bolden, and to the trustees of the fack Obsen·atory for interest in the work and for facilities given for its succ<'ssful execution. In the work of 1883 Prof. S. J.

Most of this list was supplied by the San Francisco sub-office. The pendulums, thermometers, and watch were fnrnisbed from Washington. The meridian telescope bas an aperture of 2~ inches; focal length, 31~ inches; magnifying power 60 was used ; one revolution of eye-piece micrometer=64" .35; one division of latitude level= 0" .92 ; one division of striding level=l" .05, and one division of azimuth micrometer= 1".66. The yard and metre pendulums are both of the invariable reversible type; the distances of the center of mass from the two knives are as three to one. The times of oscillation in the two positions differ by 0·.00003 for pendulum No. 4, and by 0''.0002 for pendulum No. 3. The Frodsham chronometer breaks the circuit at the first second and at every even one. Hutton breaks the first second, every even one, and tbe half second immediately preceding the even one. One division of the amplitude scale is equal to 0.050 inch. The distances from the point of support to the end of the pendulums are, for pendulum No. 3, 46.44 inches; pendulum No. 4, 1.291 metres. Hence in the former case one division is equal to .00108 R, and in the latter to .00098 R. On Deoomber 15, 1886, a leave of absence without pay for six montlis was granted me. Leav. ing W a.sbington on this date I arrived in Ilonofolu on the 12th of Januar,Y, !Javing stopped in San Francisco long enough to test and pack the instruments. Nine days later the ftrst obsenatious were made at Puuloa. The Government placed at our disposition the steam-tug Pel6, which trans· ported the party and instruments to Pearl Harbor. Arriving at 4.30 p. m., January 21, observa.· No. 11.

tions were made for time and micrometer value thr same cvP11ing, and for latitude on January 24, 2.5, and 26. The last night's work was done with tlifficnlty on account of smoke and dust from Manna. Loa, which was in eruption fLt the time. The second station was at Kahuku, at the extreme northern point of Oahu. The im1trnments were shippe<l hy i;;chooner from Honolulu on February 1, the party leaviug the following day on liorscbaek and goiug by the way of w· aialua. Observations were completed here on Fehrnary 12. Cire11msta11ces were unfavorable at tllis station. Ulomls aml rain prolonged vcr~- much the time of ohscn·ing. On February 9, work laRterl from 6.30 p. m. to 4a. rn., with only thirty-three pairs ohservcd. On the lltli, three hours ohsrrvations gave no more than two pairs. The o!Jserving station was situated a mile from our lodging place. .At midnight of tlte 12th, the requisite number of nrnasures being made, the instruments were dismounted and J>acked, and on Sunday, the 13th, the party rode to Ilonolulu, a distance of 44 miles, climbing tl1e l'ali, a mountain pass 1,200 feet high. Between February 13 and 22 the time wns spent in Honolulu dnp1ieating records, making compatations, and preparing tlrn station for gra\"ity measurements. Taking the steamer 111ika.Jia/a, on the e\-ening of the 22d, we arriYed at '\Vaimea, on the island of Kauai, at noon of tlie 24th. The pier was constructell in the afternoon (tlianks to the energy of Mr. L. ll. Stoltz) and obserrntions for time and azimuth were made in the evening. The Jatiturle and micrometer deterrninations were concluded on March 4, and on the 5th the party and instruments were transferred to Koloa. The transportation of the instruments was a matter of ditliculty. An ox-cart of the most primitive kiml was the only vehicle available, and the road was in a very bad, not to say dangerous, condition for the transportation of instruments of precision. To guard against possible accident the oliject glass of the telescope, tho eye-piece micrometer, and the levels were removed and packed in a separate box surrounded by cotton. Arriving at Koloa at noon, the instruments were put together, adjusted, aml mounted before sundown, and obsen·ations were made in the evening. The work was finished on March rn, and on tho following day everything was shipped to Hanalei by way of Honolulu. On the 19th the party rode to Kapaa, passing the falls of Waieleele, the road leading through valleys whose sides were covererl with guava, cocoa-nut, bread-fruit, fig, and mango trees. The recent rains had swollen the mountain streams and the horses were once obliged to swim, which resnlt~d in a c-0mplete wetting of saddle-bags, clothing. and records. From Kapaa to IIanalei consumed the greater part of a day, and we arrived on the evening of March 20, after six hours' travel through a pouring rain. Observations ended on the 31st, and Honolulu was reached on the morning of April 3. This place was occupied for latitude before April 12, besides making duplicates of records and some minor computations. It was now seen that the six months originally allotted to the work would not suffice. I tl1erefore, at the request of tho Surreyor-Geneml, asked for an extension of furlough for three months, to enable us to complete the whole programme. This was granted in a letter from Washington dated Aprtl 27, and ftxed the time of my return not later than September 15. On April 12 we took the steamer Kinau for Mahnkona, Hawaii, arriving on the 13th. Kobala was reached at noon. The pier was constructed on the 15th. In the evening the instrument was put in position, the chronometer correction determined, and thirty-three pairs obtained before midnight. The last observations were ma.de on the 17th and the instruments repacked the following day. On account of the violent wind nearly always prevailing at this point, it was found imp-0sii.ible to pitch a tent for shelter; refuge was taken in an old building formerly used for storing sugar. Lea.Ying Koba.la at daybreak of the 19th the harbor of Hilo was reached at midnight. The rain-fall here is exceptionally large, even for the tropics, as much as 20 feet having been measured in one year. The instruments were mounted on the summit of Halai, and were in posi· tion by tbe evening of the 21st. But only one clear night was experienced during our three weeks' stay. Some one of the party was always standing watch throughout the entire night, so that any partial break in the clouds might be utilized. Thus availing ourselves of every possible occasion, by May 14 about forty pairs had been observed, gh·ing between sixty and seventy independent measures. More observations were desired, but it was not considered advisable t-0 prolong the occupation until the return trip of the s~amer. The station was abandoned, therefore, on Satnrda~·, May 14, and on the 15th horses were engaged and the party left for Ka La.e, a. distance of about 85 miles. The crater of Kilauea was visit.eel on the 17th and found t-0 be in eruption at two

points, although the old lake of 1883 ha·l entirely subsided and disappeared. Passing by J>nnaluu, \Vaiohinu, and Kaalnalu, Ka Lae was reached at noon of the 21st. The nearest water suply was eight miles distant. It was hronght on mule hack; part of thc> road leading over an "aa'' lava flow. The animals could onlv be Rent to drink rwrv two daYs. The last observations were made on the morning of the 28th, ~rnl we were again in llo11olulu at -l p. rn. of the 31st. This station was now occupied for gravity, pellllnlnms Nos.. 3 and 1 bring swimg on three days and nights each. On .Tune 14, the party left for Kailua, Hawaii. This station was ftniRl1ed 011 the rnt11, arnl on the following day we started for Haiku, >ia Maa]aea Bay, arri\'ing on the 21st. Haiku lies at the base of Ifaleakala and was occupied for latitude and grnvity. The pendulum wa8 started on June 23, and tlie last star obser>ations were made at 10 p. m. of Jnue W. At 11 a. m. of the 30th, the ascent of the mountain was bcgnn. The party now consisted of eighteen 1wrs011s and twenty.five animals besides a cart drawn by twelve oxen. At 5 o'clock Olinda waR reached. Thi" lies near the lower limit of the cloud region (4,043 feet) and we encountered hea>y fog and rain. A stop was made for the night. On the morning of .Tuly 11 the journey was resumed. After three hours' .tra>cl a point W"as reached beyond which it was impossible to take the cart. The instruments, tents, and proYisions were now packed on mules to be carried to the summit, the chronometers, barometers, and thermometers being taken in the hand. Pas8ing through the cloud belt at an ele,ation of 8,000 feet we met clear weather again and arrived at Ana moe haole, the northwest edge of tho crater at 3 p. m. The elevation at this point is considerably over 9,000 feet, and the auimals were sufiering from the rarity of the atmosphere and from travel l»er tho lava, A rest "·as taken for an hour (see illustration No. '11), then the route was continnell along the edge ot tlrn crater, a lfo.1tance of 3 miles, to Pakaoao, at an eleYation of 9,870 feet, the I)Qint chosen for the observations. Before making the ascent it was thought feasible either t-0 make a cavity in the ground in which to swing the pendulum, or to build a small stone house, using the somewhat regular blocks of lava which were said to be in abundance on the summit. Both these Jlrojects were soon seen to be impracticable. Fortunately a crevice about 3i feet wide and 9 feet high was found between two large rocks that possessed the requisite stability and ga>e promise of quite uniform temperature. This crevice was closed behind by masonry laid in cement, and in front partly by blankets and tarpaulins and partly by masonry (see illustration No. 42), thus permitting ingress and egress in order to start the pendulum and turn it when necessary. Above, dry masonry covered with blankets and a layer of sand was used. The daily range of temperature outside the house and in observing tent was about so:i Fahr. Inside the pendulum house it was 11° centigrade. Although in the tropics and in midsummer, ice was formed nearly every night, the greatest thickness being about one-fourth of an inch. The atmosphere was exceptionally clear-many stars were observed before sundown with a telescope of 2i-inch aperture and magnifying power of sixty. All lava found on one of the peaks is highly magnetic, and differences of seYeral degrees in the declination of the needle within a distance of 2 miles have been noticed on the floor of the crater. As no provender or water aro to be found on the summit, all the animals and all men not necsary were sent down the slope on July 2 to a point where these were to be had. The first observations were made on July <t; the last on the 12th. The weather was good on the summit, the storms generally occurring several thouRand feet below. Leaving Pakaoao at Sa. m. of the 13th the party divided, the greater number returning by the way of Olinda and Makawao, and taking the instr11ments. l\Ir. Wall and myself with a guide passed down into the crater (see illustrations No. 39 and 43) 2,600 feet below, autl out the Kanpo Gap, reaching Kipahulu at 7 p. m. We arrived at Hana on the 15th a.nd closed the work there on the 26th. The weather was very unfavorable. Hana in this respect is a worth~- rirnl of Hilo, and although the rain-fall is much less, the nights are generally cloudy. The difficulty ia securing pairs of stars may be judged from the fact that one night's work of eleven hours only gave as many pairs. Arriving a.t Ka Lae o Ka Ilio on the 28th, the last observations were made on August 1. Seventy-five pairs were observed at this station in seven consecutive hours.

The night';; list eontained more than onf\ hunrlred pairs. Generally, it may he saill of all the stations tlmt lists covering from eight to ten hours' right ascension, and having about one hundred pairs, were selected in order to be ready for clear weather at any part oftlie night. 'l'hese extended lists, however, were only utilized at a few of the wind ward stations. The work at Kaupo closed the observations for the season, and we took the steamer for Ilonolulu, arriving there on the 6th. During the remainder of August we were l:'ngagetl in the Go\'ernment Office making duplicates, re:uling clironographic sheets, and making preliminary computations. A transit inst,rmnent helonging to the (}overnment Snrrny was alsoailjusted and mounted in the new obserYatory. On the 30th at noon, my connection with the lfawaiian GoYerment ceased aml I sailed fur Sau Fmuciimo, arriving at 2 p. m. of September G. 'fhc following day, work was resumed on the Co:ist and Geodetic Survey, preparations being made for the determination of gra\·ity at Lafayette Piwk Astronomical Station. Obsef\·ations were begun on September 12 and finished on the 22d. Lick Oh8ervatory was the next 8tation to be occupied. On account of the preparations then being m~ttle for the formal transfer of the observatory from the Lick tn1stees to the State, it was impracticable to make the pendulum observations immefiiately; anrl it was not until Sunday, October 9, that I left for Mount Ilarnilton. The intervening time was devoted to reading the chronograph sheets for San Francisco, and doing miscellaneous office work. The operations atl\fount Hamilton lasted from October 13 to 26. On the 30t.h (Sumby) I arrive1l in Sau Francisco. That part of the instru. mental outfit which was obtained here ten months preYionsly was returned to the Suboffice, and on No1ember ~3 I left for Washington, arriYing on the evening of the 0th. The instrumeuts sliipped by freight from San Francisco on Nornmber 1 arrived in Wasbington on December 7. The Smithsonian Institution (our base station) was occupied between December 8 and December 18. Duplicating records, reading chronograph sheets, mul compntatirrns consnm11d th1~ time until .Januar;r 1, 1888, when the reduction of the whole work, fourteen latitude and six gra1ity stations, was begun.
TRIANGULATION.

The trigonometrical connections were executed by the GoYernment SurYey, and the geodetic latitudes, computations relating thereto, and the sketches of the triangulation were furuii;hed by Professor Alexander. The following extract from the Hawaiian Survey report for 1872 refers to the base mea,surement on l\faui and the angle measurements for the primary triangles connecting the islands:
At the same time they (the U. S. Coast Snrvey) sent us a complete set of apparatus used in measuring · · · A ha.Re-line was chosen 4+ miles in lenbrth, crossiug tlrn istlrnms of Maui nearly at a right an~le, th" northern end being 7 feet and the southern 164 feet above mean tide. At't-Or gr.::ding and clearing Uw lint', and making a preliminary measurement with a long wire, the final moa3uroment with the rods was commenced August ll'l, 1871 and finished Reptember 8. The mean tempera.ture of tlrn bars during the wholu measurement was 94° }'ahr. The final corrected length of the line is 6,667. 79 metres and the probable error of the measurement is believed not to exceed au inch. · · · The true bearing of the line was determined by a long series of observations at the South Base on tho Pole star and a lantern set on the North Base, the oxact time being noted by a chro· nometer. · · · Tho angles of the primary triangles were measured with a transit theodolite ma.de by Troughton & Simms of London, with a horizontal 12-inch circle reading to one second by two micrometer microscopes, and a v»rtical 12-inch circle reading to five seconds by two vernie,rs. It is completely fitted for night observations on Atar8. The telescopo·lrns gener:>lly been used with a magnifying power of 36, and is remarkably clear. The closing error of the first quadrilateral was one second.

In the first series, the stations were occupied with the 12-inch transit reading to single seconds, except Ilauakauhi, Haleakala. 2, and Pala.ha, which were occupied with 5-iuch transits. \Yhite Hill is also called Pakaoao, and Palaha is the" Pohaku·oki-aina," i.e., the rock where the boundaries of eight districts meet. In the second ~eries, the angles of the first ten triangles were measured with the 12-inch transit, except those at Polipoli. The remaining angles of the series were me.a.sured with smaJI instruments. Geodetic latitude of Ktt Lae-o ka Ilio, 1st series, 200 371 3811.06; 2d series, 3811 .07.

The method employed was that described in the U. S. Coast and Geotietic Snr\'ey Report for Pairs of stars were chosen whose zenith distances ranged from oo to GOO and whose differences of zenith distancetl were not greater than 4'1 minutes. A.n examination of eleven stations where stars were observed up to these limits shows that the results from such stars are generally as satisfactory as those from normal pairs. The mean difference between tbe results for low stars and normal ones is not greater than the probalile error of observation. Ninety seconds between pairs, and 3-0 seconds between stars of the same pair, was the shorteRt time allowed. The stars were chosen from Appendix No. 7, Report for 1876, and from the catalogue of l~,4!1 stars observed at the Cape of Good Hope by Stone. These two lists will furnish pairs at the rate of eight or ten per hour for latitudes near 20°. The instrument used was meridian telescope No. 1 (illustration No. 47). The reductions of the stars in declination from the mean place at 1887.0 to the apparent place at the time of observation were effected by the use of the following formulru:
1880, Appendix No. 14.

By this method the computations were considerably abridged with no sacrifice of essential accuracy. The apparent places for thirty pairs on two dates can thus be derived in seven hours. The above formulru are derived from the ordinary reduction formula by dUforentiation, consid· ering the tabular differences of the quantities that vary with the date as the differential co-efficients of the quantities with respect to the time at the date already computed. The method is explained in detail in the Journal of the Franklin Institute, .April, 1889, and also in .Appendix No. 13 to this volame. The mean declinations of the stars for the epoch 1887 .0 were furnished by the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office. The treatment of the subject is set forth by Mr. C. A. Schott in the following extract from a. communication to the Assistant in ch a.rge of the Office :

UNITED S'l'A.TBS OOAST AND GEODETHJ SUHVEY.

"The method of rerluction and combination for obtaining mean places of stars (in declination) followed in the Computing Di,'ision of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, depends mainly on the investigation made by Lewis Boss in connection with the U. S. Northern Boundary Survey and as presented in bis report of February, 187i, ou the declination of fixed stars. "The places obtained bs the individual catalogues are weighted on a scale nearly identical with that used hy Boss (pp. H>O, 161 of his report) or by Anwers iu his fundamental catalogue. For catalogues later tlian 1835 these weights vary between 0.5 and 6. "\Vi th respect to the number of observations, n, the relative weights are put proportional to

(1 + ~ )- so that for instance l, 6, and 60 observations would receive th<l relative weights O. l,
1

0.5, and 0.9 nearly. "The probable error of the unit of weight is taken equal to ±0."37, a Yalue intermediate between those of Boss and Auwers; that of the declination at the mean epoch is ± 0.3 7 times the (sum)-" of the weights; that of the proper motion is derived from the weigh tis as explained below, and the tabular probable error is obtaiued by combining the last two. "The systematic corrections to the declinations are taken from the report of Boss, page 175 et seq., with some additioual columns for special catalogues; these corrections depend on the declination argument alone, those depending on right ascensions being not considered. "Unless the proper motion of a star (in declination) is given in Auwer's catalogues, it is specially made out from discussion of the individual values for the declination by each catalogue with application of the method of least squares and the use of weights, which latter depend on the square of the pifference of time elapsed between some adopted average epoch (say 1855) and the epoch of the particular catalogue. "'Vhen, however, tliere are no later observations than are used in the Northern Boundary Survey Catalogue of Boss, N ewcomb's Zodiacal Stars, or Safford's declinations, or where later obser. vations correspond pretty closely with those authorities, no such special calculation was believed necessary. "In accordance with the above principles, the mean places of stars required by the Coast and Geodetic Survey are now made out and presented in tabular form by Mr. IT. Farquhar, of the Ocm· puting Division, who has special charge of this class of computations.''

Inclination of micrometer tkread.
At Puuloa, Kahuku, and Waimea, the micrometer thread was not coincident with the tangent to the star's path when crossing the meridian. As this defect could not be remedied immediately, it became necessar.r to determine its inclination in order to correct the micrometer readings for those stars that were not observed at culmination. This was done by bisecting a number of stars at each station either before or after culmin!J,tion, and noting the time and readings of the microm· eter, aud comparing these with the regular meridian observation. For north stars the extra bisections were made after culmination and for south stars before it; the position of the rack for counting the micrometer turns, which encroached considerably on the east side of the field, made this course necessary. The reading of the micrometer was .first corrected for the change in altitude of the star between the point of observation and the meridia.n. The difforence between this corrected reading and the reading at culmination gave the error due to the inclination of the micrometer for tbis particular distance from the meridian and for a star of this declination. Dividing by the time in seconds and multiplying by the secant of the declination, we have the error in reading when an equatorial star is bisected one second from the meridian. This was done for a number of stars and the mean correction found to be 0.062 divisions. The correction to be applied to any particular star would therefore be Qd.Q62 t cos 8 and the correction to the latitude in seconds of arc 0" .02 t cos o; t being the distance from culmine.tion expressed in seconds of time. For stars bisected before tho meridian the oorrection is negative, while for those after the meridian it is positive.

The value of one revolution of the micrometer screw was determine.d eleven times during tho course of the work. Five times, Polaris was used near west elongation, and the times were noted by the eye.and-ear method to the nearest second of time. The chronograph was used six times, somewhat faster moving stars being i;hosen, and the recorded times were read off to the nearest tenth of a second. The following table gives the stations, method, time, and results of the separate determinations:

The value of one division of the level was determined at Hilo by means of the eye-Jlieee micrometer. Four determinations were made on different parts of the screw with the following results: From 0 turns to 10 turns 1 division .01423 ± .00009 From 10 turns to 20 turns = 46 ::!:: 10 From 20 turns to 30 turns 25 ± 13 From 30 turns to 40 turns 31 ± 07 Adopted value 1 division= .01429 ::!:: .00005 A previous determination at Kahuku Oahu gave 0.01428 revolutions, so the Hilo \"alne is accepted, and we have finally 1 division of level, 0".920.

Observatilnis and ret!uctions for Hatiolulu.
Ob&erviitions were made on four nights, using thirty-three pairs of stars and giving one hundred and sixteen determinations. The latitude of the British transit of Venus pier, as deduced by Captain 'l'upman, is the result of observations on thirty-five nights with two hundred and twenty· four determinations. The methods employed were, however, essentially different. The English measured the co-latitude directly, using an alt-azimuth instrument. Captain Tupman's latitude reduced to the Government observatory gives 210 18' 2''.32, so that the discrepancy between the two determinations is 0".16. The distance between the two stations is about 620 feet. In order to compare the methods, in point of view of facility of computation, economy of time in observation, or accuracy of the final result, the observations and rednctions are given in full.

The care taken in the preparation of the mean declinations of the stars observed seemed to warrant their publica.tion; and, in order that they might be a vailal.Jle for future latt tnde observations in the islands, their right ascensious for 1887, auuual variatious, precessions, etc., have been calculated and are given in the following pages. The work was done in the Oomputiug Division by Mr. Henry Farquhar, to whose excellent judgment in questions relating to star places the value of the list is due. The first column gives the star number as found in the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1876~ Appendix No. 7. When the star does not appear in this list the number given is taken from Stone's Catalogue of 12,441 stars observed at the Cape of Good Hope. Numbers above 2179 refer to the latter list. The catalogues consulted are indicated as follows :

The rnagnitmles are from Pickering's Photometry (Harvard Observatory Annals, vol. 14). In cases of yariable stars a magnitude about the brightest attained is set down, followed by the :;;ign +. Southern stars not in the Harvard Photometry have magnitudes ta.ken from Gouhl (Z). These are of two classes, those in the "Uranometria Argentina" to tenths (here corrected by -0.2 as in Pickering), and others to quarters of a magnitude (here unaltered). Double stars not noted separately by Pickering ham the d(fference taken for some other authority designated by the appropriate letter, the magnitude of the aggregate, or of the principal star, depending on Pickering, as in the other cases. The declinations are on a system in which the> proper motions of .Auwers, derived from Bradley, are used, and the 11laces of his fundamental catalogue corrected by the difference between it and that of Boss (Northern Boundary Survey Report) for 1875. · l'robable errors are estimated from the number and weight of authorities m1ed and from the time between their average epoch and 1887. The change in one hundred years of the annual precession in declination is taken from c~ttalogues of epoch from 1861 to 1880. It may in many cases be wrong by one to three units in the last place for 1887· .A hspheu between two letters in the list of authorities for declination denotes the use of aJl interYeniug letters.

Descriptions of stations.
Pakaoao.-This station is situated on the edge of the crater of Haleakala, near the southwestern corner (see illustrations Nos. 39 and 42). It was connected trigonometrically with Haleakala .A point by Mr. F. S. Dodge. The distance from the &.. station to the latitude pier is 71.8 feet and the azimuth 145° 12'. The pendulum-house was about 12 foet south of the latitude pier (see illustration No. 42). The lower end of the pendulum was 24 feet below the &. point, the height of which is given by the Government Sur\'ey as 9,870 feet above mean tide. This point has since receivetl the name of Pendulum Peak. (Am .·Journal of Science, February, 1889.) Haik1t.-The pendulums were swung in the basement of the old sugar-mill on the plantation of Mr. Henry Baldwin. It is situated about 4 miles east of Paia. Around the pendulum support was built a tight wooden compartment 5 feet sqtrnre and 10 foet high to prevent <listnrbance by currents of air. The latitucle pier was situated a few feet north of the building. Tlte connection of the latitude pier with the triangulation station at Pun o Umi was also made by Mr. Dodge, who gives the height of the bottom of the pendulum above mean tide as 385 feet. Honolulu.-The northeast corner room of the Go>ernment building (Kapuaiwa) was chosen for the observations at this station, the pendulums being hung against the east wall from two heavy iron brackets. A weight somewhat heavier than the heaviest pendulum was placed at the extremity of the arms aml no flexure which could affect the result of the observations was detected. Time was determined at the new observatory about 50 feet eastward of the building, and the signals were tram1mitted electrically to the chronograph, which was in .the pendulum-room. Around the pendulums were placed screens to prevent rapid changes of temperature and currents of air. The bottom of the pendulum was 10 feet above mean tide. 81],n Francisco.-Davidson Observatory in Lafayette Park, at the corner of Clay and Octavia streets, was occupied. The pendulums were swung from a stan<l (see illustration No. 49) aiHl were observed from an adjoining room. The station is 378 feet abo>e mean ticle. Lick Observatory.-Observations were made in the cellar of the transit house. The top plank of the stand used in San Francisco was supported at one end by the east collimator pier, and at the other by a brick wall. The pendulums were 4,205 feet aborn mean tide. lVasliingt-0n.-The penclulum-room at the Smithsonian Institution, the northeast corner of the basement, was occupied. The pendulums were swung from a stand (see illustration No. 49) similar to the one used iu San Francisco. The height of the station above mean tide is 34 feet.

Methods of observation.
The plan generally followed was to swing the pendulums at each station on the same support and t.o continue the observations through the entire twenty-four hours. This method was adhered to as far as local circumstances would permit. A wooden stand (illustration No. 49) was used at San Francisco and l-Vashiugton. A bea>y plank imbedded in masonry was used at Pakaoao and the Lick Observatory, ancl this same plank was used at Honolulu and Haiku firmly supported on massive iron brackets which were imbedded in a stone wall. Head No. 0 was used at all the stations. At the Lick Observatory only day observations were made. The iron brackets were tested for vertical flexure. No appreciable amount was discovered. The horizontal flexure of the head is supposed to have been the same at each station. The knife-edge plane was tested for horizontality before beginning each position and also after its conclusion. Three thermometers were used, suspended near the top, middle, and bottom of the pendulum, the bottom one being attached to a rod of the same metal as the pendulum and read continuously during the swing by means of the telescope used in taking tbe transits. The others were read at the beginning and end of swings. The thermome· ters were compared immediately after the observations at each station and had their zero points determined at Honolulu, San Francisco, and Washington. The pendulums were allowed to swing for 15,000 oscillations with the heavy end down and for 5,000 in the inverted position. Time was determined at 8 p. m. and the pendulums were started at the mean epoch of thest.ar observations. The half amplitude of oscillation was a.bout 50' at the beginning and fjl at the eud·

Two barometers, mercurial aml anerohl, were read as well as the wet and dry bulb thermometers. The i~endulum observat.ions were registered electrically on a Fauth chronograph (illustration No. 50). Forty transits were taken at the beginning and end of swings, with one or two intermediate 011es at intervals of an hour in order to count the whole number of oscillations. The probable t·rror of the mean of forty transits is about o·.003. The approximate value of an oscillation may be obtained at a new station by applying a correction of one one-hundred-thousandth of a second for a change of one second in the rate of the clock, 1 degree in the temperature, 1 inch in the pressure, one-hundredth of the radius in the amplitude, 100 metres in the elevation or ten minutes in the latitude (200). But this method was checked at each station from transits near the end of a swing. The rule adopted was to take isixt,y transits, allow ten minutes to elapse, and take forty more. Allow thirty minutes to pass and take forty additional transits. This with the regular observations gives sufficient data for the ileterminatio11 of the period to the nearest ten-thousandth of a second, wbich is sufficiently accuratfl to make the couut during an interval of two hours. The chronometer correction was determined by observing ten stars each evening. Four time i;tars and one circumpolar were taken in each position of the instrument and transits were observed across the five middle threads of the diaphragm. Readings of the level were made before and after each set and during the observations if time served. The transits were registered electrically on the Fauth chronograph. Tlrn observatiom; on the pendulum and the thermometer below were made by means of a reading telescope at a distance of about 15 feet. A window of plate-glass was I.milt in the front wall of the pendulum-house at Pakaoao, and a theodolite standing in the transit tent was used in observing. Metlwds of reduction. The corrections to the time of oscillation on account of the amplitude were calculated by Borda's formula Mn sin ( <p + cp') sin ( <p - <p') 3!f log sin <p-log sin <p'
<p and <p' being the initia.l and final arcs, n the number of oscillations, and M the modulus of the common system of logarithms. In finding the periods, the use of eight-place logarithms was avoided by using the formula

i i; ) A±i=A l=j= A±A2 =j=etc.

B BC

As the entire interval was only increased by a.bout its

aoo\ 075

part on account of the amplitude,

all terms involving higher powers than the first are inappreciable in the seventh place, and

i

can be disposed of mentally, only requiring one or two places. The corrections for pressure and temperature depend on Peirce's co-efficients. The atmospheric effect is considered in two parts, the first varying directly as the pressure and inversely as the temperature, and the second directly as the square root of the pressure and inversely as the eighth root of the temperature. As communicated by Professor Peirce, the co-efficients for Washington in sitlereal .time at one absolute atmosphere (1,000,000 0. G. S. units of pressure) and 15° Centigrade are:

Differential corrections were first applied to reduce to the mean temperature and pressure of the station. The mean period is theu brought to 15° temperature and to one absolute atmosphere. '£he attraction of Haleakala on the plumb-line at Kaupo (Ka Lae o Ka Ilio) was calculated by H n tton's formula

(Clarke'8 Geodesy, page 295) using a value for p derived from a comparison of the pendulum observations at the imrumit and at the sea. The island of :\faui is divided into rn·mpartments by radial lines and concentric circles following the usual method. In the present case the :first series of circles extends to the summit. They have a common difference in the radii of 1 mile. The second series extends to the valley beyond, with radii ha·dng a ratio of H· The third series includes all remaining matter above the sea-level (see illustration No. 51). The sines of the angles between the radii and the meridian of Ka Lae o Ka Ilio have a common difference of one-tenth. This arrangement facilitates the computation by making the attractions vary as the heights for the compartments in any given ring. The unit of height is taken as 100 feet, and we have the following heights for East Maui:
