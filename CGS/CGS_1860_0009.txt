REPORT.
W ASHlKGTO:S-, D. C., IJcccmba 15, 18fl0. Srn: As required by ]aw, and by the regulations of the Treasury Department, I have the honor to submit my report on the progress of the Coast Survey of tho United 8tatcs durin;; the surveying year from November 1, 1859, to November I, lSGO. The progress of the work has been, taking all its branches together, greater than during tlte year before, but the loss of one of our best steamers by collision at sea has been a sad draw· back to the general prosperity of the work. As my estimates for the time of completion of the survey must be materially affected by this losf', I earnestly recommend a special appropriation to replace tho steamer at the eadiest practicable period. The survey bas again been in progress in its land ·work, hydrograph~·. or office-work, in the twenty-two seaboard States and territory of the United States. The time of completion on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico is now near at hand, and is estimated within a reasonable limit of uncertainty of two years. A continuous triangulation stretches from Passamaquoddy bay to the boundary between North and South Carolina, and another season will make it continuous from Winyah bay to a point below lfatanzas river, south of St. Augustine. There remains, in fact, less than one-eighth of the Atlantic coast not covered by one of the classes of triangulation. In my report of last year I entered very fully into the subject of the time of completion of the survey, and have now only to add that I Bee no reason to change the statements then and there made, and that if a steam vessel is soon supplied to replace the Walker, I shall be able to make good those statements, unless some new calamity beyond the reach of our estimates overtakes us. The plans are definitely formed in my mind, and require only a steady execution, year by year, to bring them to successful completion. 'l'he Coast Survey officers han~ experience and knowledge, and there is the most cheerful, thorough, and zealous co-operation in every part of the work. The organization bas shown itself to be thoroughly effective, and only a fraction of what it has accomplished remains to be done. The portions executiug are arranged so as to fit into each other according to a general design, terminating in ~ complete survey of the coast.
COAST SURVEY OFFICE,

GENERAL STATEMENT OF PROGRESS.

The .Atlantic triangulation, as the accompanying sketch (No. 37) shc>.Vs, is continuous along the coast of twelve States from Passamaquoddy to the boundary of North and South Carolina, a stretch of more than twelve hundred miles, measured in tbe mo,;t geueral way. With an interval of some fifty-four miles, which is dim'inished every year by the party at work there, the triangulation is again continuous over the coast of South Carolina to Cumberland sound, on the coast of Georgia, two hundred and eighty miles. Then there is an interval of twentyseven miles which this season will fill up to the St. John's river, Florida; .and the tria~gles are again continuous to Matanzns inlet, sonth of St. Augustine. Two parties are workmg from Matanzas inlet south and from Indian River inlet north, to fill up that interval, to which a ' third will next season be added, proceeding north from Cape Florida. Another season or two at most will fill up the whole space from Cape Florida to Cape Sable, and along the keys from I c

Key Biscayne to Key West and the Marquesas. Charlotte harbor is fa'iangulated, and the work extends from Anclote key to Cedar ke~-s. ninety miles; from Ocilla river, by St. Mark's and Apalachicola, to Cape San Blas, ninety-five miles; over St. Andrew's bay; includes East bay, Maria de Galvez, Escambia, and Pensacola bays; touches the entrance of Perdido bay; extend,:; from Mobile bay one hundred and fifty miles to Lake Pontchartrain, and over Chandeleur and part of Isle au Breton sound to the delta of the Mississippi, the greater part of which it now includes; over Isle Dcrnicre and Caillou bay; over Atchafalaya and Cote Blanche bays; and from East bay (Galveston) two hundred and fifteen miles, passing over Matagorda, A.ransait, and Corpus Christi bayR and their dependencies, to within one hundred and fifteen miles of the Rio Grande. The progress on the western coast has not been Jess satisfactory, taking the newness of the survey there into consideration. It has included all the harbors of California and Oregon, and many of those of Washington Territory, especially those of 'Vashington souud, Puget's sound, and Admiralty inlet, the Straits of Haro and Rosario, and part of the Gulf of Georgia, in the northwest. Having given, in my letter of lal'lt year, a statement of the progress of the astronomical and magnetic work, I need not repeat it here. The longitude problem has been steadily kept i11 view, and the occurrence of the total solar eclipse, the path of which crossed from the northwestern part of the United States, through Washington Territory and the British possessions, leaving the continent on the coast of Labrador, has .been made available for the correction of longitudes and of the lunar tables by parties sent out for the purpose in connexion with those of other departments of the government, and in correspondence with the great astronomical expeditions of Europe. The number of geographical determinations published by the Coast Survey, exclusive of those made within the past year, is seven thousand one hundred and seventy-eight; the magnetic variations given are upwards of two hundred; the tidal constants for harbors and coasts, one hundred and ten; and the maps and charts of harbors, bays, inlets, sounds, shoals, &c., drawn, engraved, and published, three hundred, exclusive of progress sketches and diagrams.
DIVISION'S OF THE REPORT.

The same division of subjects ii:! retained in this report, as in those immediately preceding, namely: the introduction, the description of operations, and the Appendix. I. The first part, or introduction, briefly reviews the progress of the year, under separate heads, and contains in deta\l the estimates to provide for the continuance of the work at the same rate of progress. II. The field, hydrographic, and office work done during the year is described in detail in the second l"'rt of the report, under the liead of sections, the Atlantic and Gulf coast being divided into nin., and the Pacific coast of the United States into two sections. In each of these the ]and and hydrographic work is described in geographical order, and the office-work pertaining to each is stated at the head of the section. III. The Appendix, for ~onvenience of reference, is subdivided in several heads, as1. Field, hydrographic, and qffice detail,s, under which are included general lists of the uames of officers and the occupation of their parties; the names of officers of the army and navy serving on the work; the items of information furnished in reply to special calls; the field and office statistics of the survey; special developments made by the hydrography of the year, and a general list, including all that have been made in the work; tide-tables for the use of navigators, and detailed reports of the occupation of persons in each of the office divisions,· with lists of the engraved maps and charts, and lists of the topographical and hydrographic sheets registered in the office within the past two years.

2. Special operations and scientific discussions relative to astronomy, magnetism, and other branches of physical science. 3. Local surveys, giving information in regard to the surface features in special localities, and their resources, as bearing on commerce and navigation. 4. Miscellaneous scientific matter relative to methods and instruments. 5. Aids to navigation, recommended by officers of the survey, and referred generally for the consideration of the Light-house Board. The condensed statement of progress made within the year, to follow under tho next head, is necessary to bring the work under examination as a whole. It shows what the year's estimates have accomplished as introductory to those of the next :year but one. Such a ;;tatement necessarily excludes details in regard to persons and places which are, nevertheless, es8ential to the history of the work. The detailed statement in the second part of the report show8 the place, time, and amount of the work, and by whom executed. It is but fair that in so arduous a service the officer executing each portion of the survey should be named, and that no on~ should receive credit for or bear the responsibility of the work of another. Each section forms, as it were, a chapter of the report, of which the introduction gives a table of contents, arranged under the head of each separate operation.
GEOGRAPHICAL SECTIONS.-STATEMENT OF PROGRESS FOR THE SURVEYING YEAR 1859-'60.

I do not conceive it to be necessary to go over the estimates for the completion of the work, section by section, as I stated in my last report the conclusions arrived at, and have no change to make in them. The work is proceeding regularly, and I do not find that my assumed rate of progress for the different operations and localities is too high. A complete general view of the year's progress will be obtained by consulting the following named documents: 1. The first table (No. 1) of the .Appendix, which gives the distribution of the parties in the several sections of the coast, the officers employed, and the general limits of the work done. 2. The general map of the coast, (Sketch No. 37,) showing by characteristic s~gns the portions surveyed. 3. The detailed maps of each geographical section, from I to XI, lettered A, B, C, &c., with the sub-sketches pointing out the progress in the past year. 4. The brief view which follows these remarks, and which should be read, referring to the . sketches mentioned in 2 and 3, according to whether very general or moderately detailed information is desired. SECTION I. Ooa8t qf Maine, New Hampshire, !Jfr18:sachuseits, and Rhode Island.-(Slretclies A, and .A lris, No8. 1 and 2.)-A reconnaissance has been mad.e for connecting the Eppiug and Fire island bases by the shortest line from Wacltu.sett - - Beaconpole j Guns tock, U nkonoonuc, and W achusett sta.tions have been occupied, and observations fm· latitude and azimuth, and for ·the magnetic elements, have been made at the first and third named stations. Observations of tht> solar eclipse of July 18 for longitude were made at Gunstock, (N.

REPORT OF THE BGPERINTElfDENT OF

SECTION X. Coast ef California.-(Slcetche.~ J and J bis, Nos. 33 and 34.).;....The triangulation of the coast of Santa Barbara channel has been completed to the town of Santa Barbara from the San Pedro base; preliminary bases have been mtasurnd on Santa Rosa and San Clemente islands, and triangulations executed on both, that of the first being completed, and that on the last named nearly so. The primary triangulation north of San Francisco has been extended northward of Russian river, with determinations for latitude, azimuth, and the magnetic elements, and the secondary and tertiary work has included the shores of Tomales and Bodega bays. The topography has been in progress on Santa Cruz island and on the shores of Half Moon bay; that of Petaluma creek (San Pablo bay) has been completed, and the topography of the shores of Drake's bay. Hydrographic surveys have been made at the mouth of Salinas river, (Monterey bay;) on Oakland bar, aud at the mouth of Sacramento river. Soundings have been completed off the entrance t.o San Francisco bay, and the in-shore hydrography has been extended northward beyond Point Reyes, including Drake's bay and lagoon, and Tamales bay. Tidal observations have been kept up at S:m Diego and San Francisco. Preliminary charts of San Pedro harbor and Crescent City harbor have been drawn and engraved, and the engraving of the charts of San Francisco bay and Humboldt bay; that of the topography of San Pablo bay and the additions to Alden's reconnaissance have been completed. Additions have been made to the progre;;is sketches, and the drawing of a coast map and chart to include San Francisco bay and harbor has been continued. SECTION XI. Coast ef Oregon and that ef Washington Territory.-(Sketch K, No. 36.)-A preliminary baHe has been measured, and the triangulation of Gray's harbor executed from its entrance to the mouth of Chehalis river. The preliminary base on Sandy Point, W. T., has been remeasured, and topography has been in progress on the shores of San .Juan island, Washington sound. A hydrographic examination bas been made at the entrance of Coquille river, Oregon, and tidal observations }iavc been kept up at Astoria. Additions havo been made in drawing and cn1~Taving to Alden's reconnaissance of the western coast (upper sheet) and to tho progress sketch, and the drawing has Leen completed for a new edition of the preliminary chart of Washington sound. Progress has also been made in the drawing of a general map and chart to include that sound.

MAPS AND CHARTS.

I have heretofore described the regular seriei:i of maps and charts of the coast, which have been projected on three different scales, viz: 80 h, 0 for the more dGtailed maps and charts, representing the coast and the in-shore hydrography; of rinlooo for the preliminary charts; and of 400~00 for the general coast charts, showing the general features of the coast, and giving the off-shore and the general in-shore hydrogmphy. The computing, drawing, and engraving for these maps have made good progress during the year. The computations have been kept close up to the field-work. Within the past year one hundred and eleven sheets have been worked on in the Drawing Division. Of this number, nine are finished charts, thirty-nine are coast maps and charts, twenty-one finished mapi;i of special localities, sixteeu p1·eliminary, and two of the number are comparative charts. These are exclusive of twenty-four sketches of various kinds. Fifty-six of the sheets referred to have been completed, and fifty-five are in progress. Of those completed, twelve are maps and charts of the .first class, and an equal number charts of special localities. Eight of the number are preliminary charts and two comparative charts; and the remaining twenty are sketches, amongst which are included those showing the field progress. In the Engraving Division eight first class maps and new editions of two have been completed during the year, and twenty-four are in progress. Of this class twenty-two were commenced in previous years and twelve within the present year. In addition, seventeen plates have been engraved of second c1a!1s charts and sketches, and five plates of that class l\re yet in hand.

This gives a total of twenty-seven plates completed and twenty-nine in progress, or of fifty-six plates engraved or engraving within the year. The complete list, giving the titles of these maps and cbarts, is appended to the report of the assistant in charge of the office, and a general list of all that have been engraved up to the preeent date also accompanies it, (Appendix No. 19.) The complete list includes three hundred and eleven titles, of which sixty-eight are of first class or finished maps. The total given is exclusive of seventeen plates of progress sketches. In the following list, containing the titles of maps, charts, and sketches which accompany this report, the letters in the margin correspond to the geographical sections, as A to Section I, B to Section II, and so on.

38.Coast of Labrador, its geological structure, &c. 39.Diagrams illustrating phenomena of the solar eclipse of July, 1860. 40.Specimen cups for shallow sounding<!, and compass dividers. At the date of iny last report I had strong hopes of obtaining a more perspicuous set of progress sketches to accompany my report, but after examining many projects presented, the objections to each and every one of them seemed so much stronger than to the present sketches, that I have reluctantly been obliged to admit that for the present no change is expedient. The use of photography in reducing maps for engraving is discussed in a separate article ip. this introduction. . The office estimates up to the close of the year 1861 include the drawing of seventy of the one hundred and thirteen maps and charts 011 the scale soi,00, and give an average progress of nearly eight of these maps each year, so that they will all be in hand as early as the field parties can furnish the material; and, in fact, if the Drawiug and Photographic Divisions had merely to keep up with the current work, the force of the Drawing Division would prove too large.
ESTIMATES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1861-'62.

The annual estimates are precisely the ::lame in amount as those of last year, and are stated the usual way, the work to be executed being stat~d with the amount needed for its accomplishment.. This scale of estimate contemplates the completion of the field-work on the Atlantic and Gulf coast in eight to ten years from the present year. By restoring it to the grade of 1851-' 58, a year in time may be saYed. I liave conformed to the expressed policy of the Treasury Department in keeping the items at the reduced standard of last year. The loss of the steamer 'Valker, by collision at sea, requires an appropriation to replace her. As the government acts al'! its own insurer, this i.~ an indispensable item of estimate. The loss of a considerable part of the records of last season's work, and tho loss of time from having no steamer to take the Walker's place in the Gulf of Mexico, will be sensibly felt in our progress, and I would respectfully urge that another steamer be supplied at the earliest practicable period, so as to enable us to work up again as soon as possible to the former efficiency. The estimates suppose the same aid from tbe War and Navy Departments as heretofore. Should any part of this be withheld, the proportionate progress of the survey must be diminishefl, and its completion be postponed accordingly. The several items now presented are the same in amount as have thrice met the approve.I of Congrtss, and once by the Congress which will pass upon these. The item for the line across the Florida peninsula will complete that work. Twenty-seven miles were executed last season in an air line, and forty·three remain to be completed to reach Cedar keys. (See the accompanying sketch No. 15.) Allowing the usual progress this season, the next year, with the amount asked, will complete this triangulation. The saving over that which wonld have been required for a main triangulation around the peninsula cannot be estimated at less than four times the cost of this work across.

REPORT OF THE SGPERINTENDENT OF

These are the regular items of annual expenditure. The loss of the steamer Walker requires, to restore the efficiency of the hydrography, the following, which forms no part of the annual expenditure of the survey: To provide for a steam vessel in place of the steamer Walker, lost by collision at sea, $45,000. This last item can only be considered as replacing part of the capital of the survey, for which the government has been the immrer.
DEVELOPMENTS AND DISCOVERIES.

The general list up to 1859, inclusive, is given in Appendix No. 8, to which are also added, in the same form, the special developments made within the present year. The list includes one hundred and seventy-four items geographically arranged. While these developments are among the most palpable advantages of the Coast Survey, the special statements in regard to them are only a part of the general facts shown on the maps and charts. I am again indebted to George W. Blunt, esq., of New York, in having received from him a notice by Captain Lott, of the steamship Asia, of a rip with eleven fathoms, and with considerably deeper water around it, about fourteen miles south of Fishing Rip, and twenty-four miles southeast of Davis's shoal. As it did not appear that this space was sounded out by Lieut. Comg. McBlair, or Commander Stellwagen, U. S. N., who furnished the hydrography of the vicinity of the Nantu~ket shoals, I detailed a party at once for this work, and the development has been made which is briefly referred to here, and more particularly under the head of Hydrography of Section I. In prosecuting that service, Lieut. Comg. Phelps discovered in the same vicinity a much more extensive shoal, commencing h&If a mile eastward of the rip, aud stretching N.NE. more than six nautical miles, with ten to ten and a half fathoms on it. This shoal is separated by deep water from the rip referred to. The resurvey of parts of Boston harbor to develop the changes and their causes has been made at the expense of the city, and has led to results of importance to the future of that great commercial centre. I append here a list of the special localities in which developments have been made by the hydrographic or other parties during the present season. 1- A ledge with four fathoms water on it, discovered S.SW. } W., (true,) and a mile and a. quarter from Pemaquid light-house, coast of Maine. 2. Numerous daugerous reefs and ledges developed at the entrance and in the approaches of Damariscotta river, Me. 3. Two rocks, one with three and a quarter fathoms, the other with only ten feet of water, and a ledge with three and a half fathoms found in the channel of Booth bay, Me. 4. Jeffrey's bank and Jeffrey's ledge, off the coast of Maine, thoroughly sounded out. 5. Determination of the position of White Rock ledge at the entrance of Saugus river, Mass. 6. Discovery of a rock with only seventeen feet of water at mean low tide in the Narrows of Boston harbor. 7. Special investigation of the currents of Boston harbor. 8. Special tidal and current observations at the mouth of Scusset river, (Cape Cod bay.) 9. Discovery of a shoal lying N.NE. over six miles long, and twenty-four miles southeast of Davis's south shoal, with ten to ten and a half fathoms of water. 10. Extent of the sea encroachment at Cape Hatteras, e.nd changes found near Hatteras inlet, N. C. 11. Greater depth found through the channel of Coosa\v river, S. C., (inland passage,) than has been hitherto supposed to exist.

12. Changes in shore-line and in depth observed in Ossabaw sound, Ga. 13. A new channel developed leading into Sapelo ;;ound, Ga., ihree quarters of a mile southward of, and better than the one in use. 14. A shoal e.pot found off the coast of Florida, ten miles from land, and fifteen miles NE. of Indian River inlet. 15. Tennessee shoals, Florida reef, developed, giving only hvelve feet of water on the outer shoal. lG. The position of a sunken wreck de1ermined and marked, lying off Grassy key, Florida reef, and near the track of vessels. 17. Further investigation of the character of the Gulf Stream in the Florida straits. 18. Indications noticed of a deeper and better channel forming, to lead to the East Pass anchorage, St. George's sound, Fla. 19. Changes in the depth of water observed by comparison of soundings at Penlido entrance. 20. The currents of Mobile bay specially investigated.

SURVEYS.

'l hese have been three in number, undertaken by request and at the expense of the parties named, and with the approval of the Treasury Department. In the order of time at which they were undertaken they are: of Mobile bay, to ascertain the changes and present condition of the bay, undertaken at the request and expense of the commissioners on the improvement of Mobile harbor and bay, named in a law of the St'lte of .Alabama; of Boston harbor, undertaken by request and at the expense of the city government, and of the site of a proposed canal to connect Buzzard's and Cape Cod bays so as to avoid the dangerous coasting navigation around Cape Cod peninsula and by the inner Nantucket shoals, at the request of a committee of the Massachusetts legislature and at the expense of the State. These surveys all furnish important data for the direct purposes of the Coast Survey, besides rendering great service to the com· rnerce and navigation of important lo<'alities, and of the country generaliy. They find their precedent in the elaborate works in Portland, New York, and Charleston harbors, undertaken by city and State action. They are connected, as in these cases, with the action of commissioners on those harbors, or of advisory councils of officers connected with the United States government, of which the Superintendent of the Coast Survey is a member. The preservation of the harbors of the country is the object, by preventing dangerous encroachments on the water in the rapid progref'.ls of buildings and of improvements on land, by ascertaining the changes caused in the water space by the changes in the land, and the causes of thef'e changes. More elaborate observations of tides and currents, of hydrographic, and sometimes of topo· graphical details, are needed than are demanded for purposes of navigation, and hence beyond the usual requirements of the Coast Survey, and properly at the expense of the local authorities. The detitiled statement of the several parts of these surveys be found under their appropriate heads in Sections VIII and I. I propose now merely to state some of the leading observations made, and of the general results arrived at. In Mobile bay, besides the usual soundings which were minutely made at the head of the hay, and in the rh-ers forming the delta of the Aiabama river, numerous current stations were occupied at which the direction and force of the currents were observed at the surface and at various depths below it. '.l'he1<e were selected with the view to determine the causes of change which the hydrography developed, and to ascertain the direction in which changes might still be expected; also the greater or less scour of tidal and river currents at different places and depths, and under different circumstances. The results are represented on elaborate diagrams,

'"ill

which address the eye immediately, permitting a ready anu rapid generalization of the facts. The current observations were connected with those on the tides at stations suitably selected. In the course of tl1e tidal and current ob:;;ervations off the bar, at t1ie entrance to the bay, it was discovered that there is a general currl'nt setting from the eastward, modifying the direction and force of both ebb and1lood tidal currents wliich tend out of and into this great bay, aud dcterminiug the final direction of its channel and bars. This is an important fact for future development. The tables resulting from the observations furnish the data for tracing the currents of the rivers into the bay, and of the bay into the ocean, in direction and "°clocity, at and below the surface, in the channels aud passes; upon the barf'., and in the bay and gulf; the effects of winds; the direction and force of the scouring forces furnii;lwd by the currents in the different strata of water from the surface to the bottom, giving to the engineer a clue to guide him in the labyrinth of effects-now a pool, now a shallow, now a cbannel, now a bar. The ca::e of Boston liarbor is a very different one; small rivers only enter its head, while the ocean tide rises to a six-fold height, and their currents are divided by numerous islands which they abrade, and which are exposed to tLe violence of the waves of a habitually stormy sea. The old tidal reservoirs which gave 10cour lrnvc been, in many cases, partially filled up or obstructed in the progress of improvement, and changes of regimen of considerable importance have been produced. A comparison of tbe old and new maps show this. The same officers who worked in :Mouile bay, Lieut. Comg. J. ·Wilkinson a11d Assista11t Henry Mitchell, have given their attention to the developmentE> here. The inner harbor has been sounded out to compare with ibe results of Corumandt>r Charles II. Davis, wlw made the survey in connection with the Coast Survey in l 852, and with the earlier results of Commodore Wadsworth. Parts of the main ship channel ha\·e been re-examined. Assistant Mitchell has occupied current Matio11s at the approaches in the main ship channel, and the various passages among the islands in tbe inner harbor, and at the entrance to its affiuents, the Charles and Mystic rivers, and Great Snuth La:y. He has examined the causes of the most important shoals, flats, and spits where changes have occun-ed or are occurring, with a view to present such results to the com· mi10sioners as may enable them io suggest the measures needed to prevent the deterioration of this important harbor. To show the nature of the results obtainable from such observations, I quote a few lines from Assistant Mitchell's n·port. "At this station we determined that the flats off South Boston may be the deposit both of irnspended and rolled material[,!, since the ebb from the rivers above (the Charles aud Mystic) sets over upon them, and the resultant of all the forces of the currents for tweuty-five hours takes a course towards the boldest place, (S. 4° W.) The portion of the shoal to'vards which the ebb sets is fouud to be a place of no activity of current, so that whatever is carried there lodges in the long gi·ass. The set of the re1mltant in the same direction shows the origin of the sandy strata of the fiats." I shall, at a future time, present the details of Assistant Mitchell's ingenious and persevering investigations in the Appendix to my report, when the subject is matured by him. In the connection with this ,,·ork of bis, I should refer to the ingenious instruments dovised for bringing up specimens of the materials of shoals, &c., at different depths, described in .Appendix No. 39. Resurveys of the principal islands have been made on a large scale, and with all the resources of topographical execution for which he is 1>0 distinguished, by .Assistant H. L. Whiting, of the Coast Survey; and the maps have been furnished to the commissioners, to show, by comparison with former Coast Survey work, the wearing away of the islands, and the formation of spit-a, beaches, and the }jke.
TIDE TABLES.

These have undergone a revision in the Tidal Division of the Coast Survey office, and a tide table for Key West, where the diurnal inequality is oonaidera.ble, has been added on the

THE UNITED ST.A.TES COAST SURVEY.

19

same plan as that adopted for the Pacific coast, where the tides are of a similar type with these. The Key We8t tides arc the representation of those along the :Florida coast to Cape Florida, where the large diurnal inequality is much diminished, and the tides take the .Atlantic form. Also of those along the western coast of the Florida peninsula to Cape San Blas. 'l'lae same type is slightly shown between Isle Derniere, on the coast of Louisiana, and Galveston, on the coast of Texas. The tables in the .Appendix No. 16 give the f"orrected estabfo;l1ment or mean 1unitidal interval of one hundred and ten ports, the rise and fall o[ mean, sp1·ing. anJ neap tides, and the mean duration of the flood and ebb tide a11d of the stand between them. Rules are given which enable the navigator to compute the time and height of high and low water, and to correct the rough computations, if he chooses to go in!o details, fo1· half monthly and daily inequality. The tides of the Atlantic, Gnlf, and Pacific coasts are treated, and easy rules given in relation to tidal currents of the Atlantic coast. These tables are contiuually correctecl from the observations made at the permanent tidal stations, and chiefly with self-reg·istering instruments for both time nnd height. The results are regularly transmitted to the office aud there computed.
TIDES AND
CURRE~TS.

The permanent tidal stations on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific have been kept up as heretofore, six on the Atlantic coast, three on the Pacific, and two Oil the Gulf of :Mcxico.-(See .Appendix No. 18.) Two improvements in the self-registering gauges are uoticed in tlie report of Assistant Pourtales, in charge of the Tidal Di,·ision, one a method of keeping the gauge from freezing during the winter season by the use of kerosene oil, and the other a contrivance for equalizing the action of the weig·ht on the receiviug and deliYering rollers of the gauge, as the paper accumulates in one and is wound off the other. Through the kindness of Lieut. Dahlgren, U.S. N., the tide-gauge at the Washington navy yard is kept up. The obser· vations along the western coast of the Florida peni11sula having been kept up for a year, the gauges have been transferred to parts further westward, between St. Mark's and Last island, on the coast of Louisiana. The change of type of the tidal curve from the semi-diurnal, with a large inequality, into the diurnal type, which occurs between St. Mark's and Cape San Blas, is very gradual, as has been found by intermediate stations at Dog island and Cape St. George, coast of Florida. The observations in the Pensacola navy yard have been kept np by S. Thayer Abert, esq., engineer of the yard. Meteorological observations have beeu kept up in connection with the tidal ones. The current observations in Mobile bay, Boston harbor, and Buzzarc' s and Cape Cod bays are ~tive to special surveys, under which head they will be noticed.
RULE3 FOR PHOTOGRAPHING, DRAWING, A:SD ENGRAVl:S-G OF MAPS, CHARTS, ETC.

In 1845, and the years immediately following, the subject of the style of drawing and engraYing the maps and charts of the survey was discussed in great detail by Captain .A. A.. Humphreys, then assistant in charge of the Coast Survey office, and by Assistants John Farley and W. M. C. Fairfax and myself, with the aid of Meesrs. Selma1· Siebert, F. Dankworth, and John Knight, engravers. Great pains were ta.ken in that early stage of the work to introduce uniformity and system in the execution of the various kinds of office-work. In the numerous change3 of officers in charge of the office and its divisions many departures had occurred from this system. Besides, large numbers of maps and charts of different orders had been published, and the criticisms upon them by navigators and others hud enlightened us Oil many doubtful points. The labor ' too ., of eno-raving the first class charts in th~ style adopted had ,. 0 under the most favorable circumstances, proved greater than was expected. But above and before other reasons, photography was to be introduced as a regular part of office detail, and g~t changes were neeeaaa.rily consequent. I determined therefore to have a thorough

an

20

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

revision of the whole system; to re-establish approved rules and usag~s, and carefully to study new ones; to avail ourselves, in short, of the experience acquired in the field and office for a new step in improvement. Assistant H. L Whiting, whose experience in field topography is greater than that of any other assistant in the survey, and whose success in all matters relating to representations of ground in the field and office is very great, was ordered to the office to study the whole subject. His communications with me, with the assistant in charge, the chiefs of the Drawing and Engraving Divisions, and with Mr. Mathiot, the draughtsmen, and the engravers, were constant, and subject after subject was passed in review by him, and all the experience and knowledge at hand were brought to bear upon the conclusions. As the subjects were matured and met my approval, they were embodied in a series of office directions, to be carefully observed by all concerned. It would lead to too much technical detail to give here the discussions of the subjects or the rules and directions adopted, but in justice to the labors thus accomplished I must briefly allude to the different matters embraced in Assistant Whiting's reports, and which were definitively settled for the present by office rules. The whole subject of topographical and bydrographic reductions was reviewed; the con· stituent parts of the map or chart; the representation of natural and artificial objects; the conventional signs; the lettering; and the figures, as especially adapted to the coast maps and charts 011 the scale of 815 ~- 00 , and those coming under the same rules. The subject of the scale of shade. by which ground is represented by lmchuros, was carefully gone over. The scale of Lehman and that of natural sines had been critically examined, in 1845, by Captain Humphreys and Assistant Fairfax, and a modified scale bad been adopted which represented more distinctly the smaller slopes from () 0 to 5°, and the higher slopes, at which Lehman's scale also fails to give distinctions. This scale of shade not only secures variety and picturesque effect in the maps, but, if thoroughly carried out, enables an expert to infer each slope accurately from the hachuring. The modifications introduced by the study of Mr. Whiting, aided by the researches of Mr. Mathiot, and the trials of Mr. E. Hergesheimer, are briefly stated in Mr. Whiting's report, as follows: "The new scale proposed is based upon tho strong and effective line of Lehman, from 5° to 25°, (its best section,) and from 25° to 40° it follows the line or curve of natural sines. This gives at 5° a proportion of one part of black to eight of white, and at 40° four parts of black to one of white. Within this range the scale has been found to answer all practical demands in representing natural contour, and is considered the best gradation of light and 11hade which experiment could develop. Beyond these well known and mathematical ba11es the scale is extended in the higher range to 75°, and in the lower rnnge to 1°. This has been done by continuing the same strength of line as at 5°, with an increase of twenty-five per cent. of white for each degree from 4° to 1°, inclusive, which gives a distinct yet pleasing contrast between these important slopes. In the higher range the unit of black is increased twenty-five per cent. for the first 5°, and twenty-five per cent. each for the next three divisions of 10°, leaving the last 15° of slope, from 75° to 90°, in full black." This scale is at once practicable in execution and graphic in effect, and adheres with sufficient closeness to that of the existing maps, avoiding some practical difficulties which experience had developed in representing the lowest and highest slopes. The lettering, which had originally been studied \''ith care by Assistant Farley, aided by Mr. F. Dankworth and Mr. .John Knight, engravers, was reviewed, and examples selected of -the most approved in each class. The conventional signs in the topographical maps were improved; and also in the hydrographic charts, with the aid of the officers in the hydrograpbic division, the tendency being to simplification. New gauges for the size of figures were adopted, thie former having, by general consent, been proved too small. It will be readily understood how photography requires ·an entire change of s,..tem ·in

reducing maps and charts. Distances on the field scale of 1~, '"hich are considerable quantities, are insignificant, and even disappear when reduced to the scale of 81rh0 , so that the outlines of two buildings, for example, distinctly separated on the surveying scale, when reduced in strict proportion, coalesce, and the buildings themselves appear as mere black dots. The importance to accuracy of retaiuing the large scale for surveying is too great to permit that to be given up. The very oLject of a large surveying scah! is to in:mre such accuracy that small aberrations will not be note-worthy on the reduced scales. Besides, the same region of country is represented on several different scales in the reduced charts adapted to in-shore and off-shore navigation, or to harbor purposes. Experience has sliown that these maps are also much sought and very useful as a general guide in improvement, often of the most important and widely useful kind. Again, photography copying faithfully on the reduced scale gives a perfect fac simile of a drawing, exhibiting minutely the style of the original. It is chimerical to suppose that any number of rules or amount of training will ever produce field drawings identical in style. It is with a man's drawing as with his handwriting; one drawing may be very like in style to another, as one handwriting is like another, and the faithful photograph represents the individuality of each style. A photographic reduction, then, from dra"·ings by several persons would represent various styles, and, reducing every part of the drawing proportionately, would blend all of a certain degree of fineness so that the unassisted eye could not separate or distinguish them. The difficulties usually supposed to apply to the reduction of maps by photography, distortion, shrinkage, and the like, are not the most formidable ones, but have been overcome for some time. In bringing this art into regular use we studied what was wanted on the reduced scale of the map, and how it was to be procured. From this resulted a system of generalizing, easily applied to tracings, and embracing in the cases of contours the omission of the minor irregularities of the curves; in the case of shore-lines of the minor indentations and inflections, and so on. In the case of conventional signs the exaggeration of the dimensions of objects to he shown singly, (as single houses and the like,) and the grouping of those to be represented in masses, (as villages, towns, and cities,) complete the generalization for practical purposes. ~ These tracings occupy but little time, and the generalizations are made according to rules com-. pleted for the 8 0 ~ 0 0 scale of our coast maps and charts. As the photographic system supersedes t.he elaborate and elegant drawing of the former drawing school, coloring is introduced to show varieties in cultivation, wood, marsh, and the like. The generalization is made on a tracing on the full field scale. It is reduced one-fourth and studied, correcting any imperfoctious before they are so far reduced as to make them difficult of detection. Then reducing one-half again, coloring the reduced photograph, and sharpening such of the details as need it, completes the engraver's pictorial copy. The photographic reduction is also made on glass, so that the distances may be measured, and the outlines taken, free from the expansion of paper. The modifications in the details of engraving formerly arranged by Capt. Humphreys, Assistant Farley, Messrs. Siebert and Dankworth,' and myself, flow naturally out of these changes, and have employed the ingenuity of Messrs. Whiting, Hergesheimer, Mathiot, McCoy, Rolle, John Knight, and Mr. Hinkle, to whose interest in the matter the work is much indebted. Assistant Whiting's reports on the interesting subjects of topographical contour and features, on hydrographic reductions and details, on photography, and on the scale uf shades, are given at length in Appendix No. 20.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The lists of topographical and hydrographic sheets will be extended according to the number received, and given every third year or oftener. Up to the }'ear 1859, the lists containing the titles of sheets received during the two years previous to the date of my report were given in tho Appendix Nos. 18 and 19.
INFORMATION FURNISHED.

The information furnished from tbe archives, under the authority of the Treasury Department, during the past year, is stated in Appendix No. 6. The rule which requires fro~ publishers of maps and charts that acknowledgment slwuld Le made on tho face of the publication for the information derived from the archives is plain, and consistent with fair dealing, and the department exacts its precii;e fulfilment, so that the Coast Survey shall not be made responsible for more, nor receive credit for less, than the precise work communicated.
STATISTICS.

The table of statistics has been added to, so as to bring it up to the opening of the present surveying year, and is given in Appendix No. 7. Up to 1859, inclusfre, the triangulation had covered an area of nearly forty-eight thousand sqnarc miles; had dendopcd a general extent of coast of over four thousand, and a shore-liue of about twenty thousand miles, determining upwards of eight thousand geographical positions. For longitude detenninations, seventy-six stations bad been occupied; for latitude, one hundred and nineteen; and for azimuth, seventy-sevell stations. The topography had extended over an area of fifteen thousand six hundred square miles, having a general coast-line of over thirty-two hundred, and more than thirty-eight thousand miles of shore-line, measuring the indentations. The hydrography extended over an area estimated at fort.y-four thousand square miles, in which more than one hundred and eig-hty-four thousand mi1es were run in sounding; five million eight hundred thousand sounding-s made, and over eight thousand specimens of the bottom obtained. The number of manuscript maps and charts was one thous;rnd nine hundred and eighty-five, ., and of engraved maps, chartE', and sketches, four hundred and forty-five plates.
D[STRIBUTION OF REPORTS AND MAPS.

The lists for the distribution of reports from the Coast Survey office have been thoroughly re·.-ised within the past year. There are now upon it over four thousand names of institutions and individuals. The demands for the rep0rt of 1858, of which a very limited edition was published, (sevBn thousand nine lmndred and fifty copies,) have been very embarrassing, as it was impossible to supply the number of copies required; Of the report of 1859 six thousand and two hundred extra copies were ordered by the Senate, and five thousand by the House of Representatives, of which eight thousand were to be distributed from the office. The report for 1858 was published on the 1st of February, 1860, and that for 185!}, it is expected, will be ready early in the session of Congress. More than six thousand copies of maps, charts, and sketches have been distributed from the office since the date of my last report, to institutions and individuals in all parts of the United States, and through the agency of the Smithsonian Institution to those in foreign countries.
RECORDS AND RESULTS.

I must again call attention to the fact that the appropriation for tl1e records and results merely enables us to prepare the materials from observations for publication, and not actually to publish. I would earnestly recommend that a sufficient amount be appropriated to enable us to make these publications while t11e results are fresh; but having dwelt upon this matter often, 11.nd shown it in its diffe,rent pointa of view1 it would be mere repetition to go again 9v~

the subject. A volume of the Gulf Stream results is nearly ready in manuscript, and will be published if the balance with the disbursing agent of the Coast Survey permits.
LABRADOR EXPEDITION, ETC.

The subject of longitudes has been repeatedly referred to the Coast Survey by law, and every method known to science has been applied in the determinations required to con· nect our longitudes with those of ''well determined European observatories." The astronomical and chronometric methods have been carefully applied, the former continuously, and we were prepared to use the telegraphic wire to Europe. TLe total eclipse of July 18 afforded one of the best opportunities for longitude determinations i.n<l for correctious of the tables, as the central shadow passing across "\Vashiugton Territory into the British dominions, and leaving the coast of North .America near the northeastern part of Labrador, near Cape Chudleigh, crossed the southwestern portion of Europe in very accessible portions of Spain. The European expeditious announced were to include the leading astronomers of many countries, and it was a rare opportunity for us to co-operate in these world-wide observations. The interest excited by it in many of our statesmen is shown by the history of the legislation. .A resolution (Appendix No. 21) was offered in the Senate of the United States, by the Hon. James .A. Pearce, of :Ma1J'land, on the 8tli of May, referred to the Library Committee, reported to the Senate, and adopted by a large vote on the same day. The resolution was moved in the House of Representative:;; as a report from the Library Committee, by the Hon. John U. Pettit, of Indiana, on the 12th of May, and adopted by a large vote on the 12th of June. The joint resolution thus passed was approved by the President of the United States on the 15th of June. As directed, I proceeded to organize the expedition, assigning the Coast Survey steamer Bibb, Lieut. Comg. Alexander Murray, U.S. N., to the service, and placing it under the charge of Stephen Alexander, LL.D., of the College of New Jersey-one of the most experienced m·tronomers in this speciality in the United States; associating with him, under the terms of tl1e law, four astronomers, viz: President F. A. P. Barnard, of the University of Missi::!sippi; Professor Venable, of the College of South Carolina; Professor A. 1V. Smith, U. S. N., of the Naval .Academy of Annapolis, and Lie11t. E. D. Ashe, R. N., director of the observatory at Quebt:call volunteers in this 1nteresting scientific enterprise. As assistants were added: for astronomy, William Henry, esq., of \Vashiugton; for meteorology, O;;car M. Lieber, esq., geologist, of South Carolina; Edward Goodfellow, assistant in the Coast Survey, and Samuel Walker, aid, for magnetic observations; Mr. Duchochois, of New York, volunteered to go as photographer to the expedition, and Mr . .A. W. Thompson, aid in the Coast Survey, was as9igned as his assistant. Through the liberality of the following named individuals and institutions, the sum of eleven hundred dollars was placed at my disposal for the personal and scientific expeuses of the expedition: the Smithsonian Institution, of Washington; Columbia College, N e\v York; J. Lennox, esq., and Lorillard Spencer, esq., of New York" and Doctor Thomas B. Wilson, of Newark, Delaware. 'l'he Photographic.al Society of New York, through their president, Doctor Draper, i~terested themselves in supplying a volunteer for this service, and L. M. Rutherford, esq., hberally provided the outfit of apparatus and instruments, and gave tbe benefit of his experi· rience and of his observatory in the preparations for photographing the sun. With great zeal Lieut. Comg. Murray and his officers prepared their little steamer for t.his distant, arduous, and somewhat dangerous service, and she left S cw York on the 28th of June, arriving at Sydney, Cape Breton, where she took in a supply of coal, on the 3d of July, a1:d at Aulezavik, in latitude 59° 47' 49" N., and longitude 4h. lGin. 53s.

with whom the detaiJs of arrangement were to be finally determined. The officers of the vessel were associated with the party as aids, and hydrograpbic instructions were given to Lieut. Comg. Murray. All these matters were fully, carefully, and satisfactorily attended to by Professor Alexander, so that on arriving at their haven of Aulezavik each one knew what was to be his contribution to the general movement. The manner in which this was accomplished, the proceedings of the expedition on the voyage and on their arrival at .Aulezavik, the preparations for the observations, the observations themselves and their results, and the return of the expedition, are all lucidly stated by Professor Alexander in his report, (Appendix No. 21,) which, with extraordinary promptness, was handed to me, with all the sub-reports, on the arrival of the steamer Bibb in the harbor of Newport, on the 7th of August. The American .Association for the .Aclvancement of Science was in session at that time in Newport, and received the returning astronomers with hearty greetings, and their statement of the results obtained, with much interest. Theu return was the more opportune that, as Professor .Alexander had been the president of the meeting of last year, an address from him was therefore due, and President Barnard was the president elect for the next year of the association. The successful carrying of this expedition to the point desired, and its safe return, were subjects of congratulation to all, and reflect the highest credit upon Lieut. Comg. Murray and his officers. To the cordial co-operation of all the members of the expedition the success which attended their efforts was greatly due. The report of Professor Alexander, and the sub-reports joined to it in the Appendix, (No. 21,) give all desirable details in reference to the scientific proceedings and results. The determination of latitude and longitude of the elevation, &c., of the station; of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity; the distribution of labor before, on, and after the eclipse day, (the 18th of July;) the instruments used; their mounting; tbe character of the weather; a detailed synopsis of the observations made, including those of tbe times and physical phenomena; the photographic results, are all fully stated. The sub-reports on meteorological observations, by Professor Venable and Mr. Lieber; on magnetic observations, by Mr. Goodfellow and Mr. Walker; of Doctor Barnard, Lieutenant Ashe, R. N., Professor Smith, U. S. N., Profossor Venable, and Mr. Lieber, on the physical and other phenemena observed by them during the eclipse; of Mr. Duchocbois and Mr. Thompson, on the photographic methods and results; of Messrs. Platt, Nones, and the seamen of the steamer; and of Surgeon's Steward Collins, which accompany Professor Alexander's statement, complete the details of the account of the labors of the party. It was a gratifying result of the foresight with which mattere had been arranged, that though the astronomers were deprived of the sight of the corona by the interposition of clouds, it was Been and well observed on ship-board by the petty officers and seamen who had been assigned their part in the observing. Professor Alexander mentions with special approval the services of Engineer French and of Acting Sailing-master Platt, of the steamer. A. brief but interesting report on the geology of the region visited, with a map, and of the hydrography, with maps and sketches, have been more recently forwarded by Oscar M. Lieber, esq., and Lieut. Comg. Alexander Murray, respectively. It would be out of place here to dwell upon the results which are thus fully developed by the officers of the expedition. The report is of very moderate dimensions, and will thoroughly repay a careful perusal. The observations of the time of the several phases will be referred to the Computing Division for its use. In complying with the terms of the joint resolution of Congress, the whole expense to the government of this exp-edition, over and above the ordinary expenditure of keeping the party together, was for the coal used, engineer stores, and incidental repairs to the hull of the ve6*el, a.mounting to less than two thou.sand doU·s. The &eientific expenditure was botne .fiom ·tbe

Thirteen photographs of the eclipse, and thirty-six. stereoscopic views of the coast of Labrador and of the doings of the party, were made by Mr. Duchochois, and are deposited in the archives of the Coast Survey. Through the kind and intelligent interest of Sir .Alexander Bannerman, governor of Newfoundland, and Sir George Simpson, of the Hudson's Bay Company, the party in the steamer Bibb were provided with such credentials as would have secured, in case of need, the sympathy and assistance of the officials connected with their respective departments on the coast of Labrador. The friendly letter of the governor of Newfoundland, advising mo in regard to his action in the premise.,, expresses good wishes that must have been prompted by a full appreciation of the importance of the object in view. In .Appendix No. 41 will be found a statement of the particulars of the expedition to the coast of Labrador, in the form of a report from Lieut. Comg. Murray, who was in charge of the steamer Bibb. The solar eclipse of July was successfully observed at a station near Fort Steilacoom, Waahington Territory, by Lieutenant J. M. Gilliss, U. S. N., who was assigned to the Coast Survey for that purpose, on his volunteering for the service, by the honorable Secretary of the Navy. The report of Lieutenant Gilliss, and many results of interest, with the particulars of the undertaking, are given in Appendix No. 22, and alluded to under the head of Section XI.
OCCULTATIONS OF PLEIADES, ETC.

During the year the charts of predictions of occultations of the Pleiades have been forwarded, in pursuance of the general plan proposed by Professor Peirce, of Cambridge, Mass., and committed to his execution, and one hundred and thirteen results haYe been received from observatories and stations in the United States and in Europe. The computations have been made as heretofore, by Mr. Edward Pearce, jr., under the general direction of Professor Peirce. The list now embraces twenty-eight stations in America, and a like number in Europe. Charts for the series of October 14 and December 8, 1859, and of January 4, February 28, June 16, and September 6, 1860, were forwarded to the foreign stations, and records of the observations of the series of December 8, February 28, and September 6, have been received. To the .American stations charts for the series of October 14, 1859, and January 4, March 26, July 13, September 6, and October 3, 1860, were sent; and of the first four the returns have been received at the office. At the Coast Survey station on Gunstock mountain, New Hampshire, occupied by my p11rty this season, the occultations of the 13th of July were observed, and the times Qf immersion and emersion of four stars of the Pleiades group carefully noted. Valuable series of observations at this epoch, within four days of the solar eclipse, were also obtained at the U. S. Military .Academy, West Point; at Southwick, Mass.; and under somewhat less favorable circumstances, by Professor Gobel, at Newport, Mo. Observations also of the occultation of the pfanet Venus by the moon on the 24th of April, and of two stars on the 6th of March, have been communicated; the fit-st by Professor W. B. Jack:, of Fredericton, N. B.; and those of the second date by J. Hartnup, esq., of the Liverpool Observatory, England. The records of forty-two moon culminations observed at Cincinnati have been furnished by Professor 0. M. Mit~hel.
MAGNETIC VARIATION OR DECLINATION.

One of the contributions to general physics bearing upon the determination of the magnetic 'Variation, .or declination ae it is now more generally called, wl1ich was commenced in my report of wt year, is i'ullowed in this. The practi~l end is, having given a measurement of the 4 c

26

REPORT OF TIIE l'!lJrERINTENDENT OF

variation of the needle at any hour of the day, or on a particular day of the month in a certain year, to reduce it to the mean of that year, month, and day. This may he done by tables given in tho memoir, .Appendix No. 23, or by the diagram on Sketch No. 7. The diagram corresponds to a table of double entry, the hours of the day being at the top and bottom, and the months of the year at the sides. The reductions for the position of the needle are , represented by the lines of equal change for every half minute. .A surface is thus artificially roprcscntcd, which shows to the eye, in curves of equal reduction, the changes of the needleonc surface for the changes to the east, and one for those to the west. Comparing this with the mode of representing surfaces (of the ground for example) by horizontal curves, the hills and valleys represent the changes. The average line is also traced on the diagram. If, then, we would find a correction to be applied to a certain observation, we enter the diagram with the hour of the day, and draw a line parallel to the side border, and with the month, drawing a line parallel to the upper or lower edge; from the meeting point of these two lines erect a perpendicular to the plane of the paper, and where it strikes the curved surface gives the amount of change; or practically, at the intersection of the two lines first drawn will be found the projection of the point which shows the change. If it is on one of the curves, simply read it off; if between two, make a proportionate allowance . .Another practical matter derived from this discussion is, the best time of day for observing the magnetic variation. The hours during the year which vary least from the average of the whole year are those corresponding to the greatest western declination, and to the morning mean declination. On the average, these hours are lh. 16m. p. m. and lOh. 26m. a. m., both of which are very convenient for working. The greatest difference in the time of occurrence between any one month and the average of all is, for the greatest western declination thirtyone minutes, and for the mean twenty-eight minutes. So the surveyor or navigator will be safest in using these hours for his determinations of the variation of the compass. The whole subjed is eminently a practical one, though reached by a scientific discussion which seems to pass much beyond the bounds of the practical. A general idea of the discussion may be had as follows: The observations consisted in ascertaining, by Gauss's new instrume11ts, the position of the magnetic needle or bar every hour or every two hours in the twenty-four for a period of five years, or from 1840 to 1845. The history of them and of their publication is given in my first paper.* The first step was to examine the observations, and take out those which were affected by auroras or magnetic storms. This was done by Peirce's criterion, a mathematical formula which, by comparing separate observations with the mean, enables the computer to know whether the result will be nearer the truth, or more probable with or without the observation in question, and thus to reject doubtful observations-not by an arbitrary process or by a biassed judgment, but by rigid computations, which show these results to be accepted and those to be rejected. The magnetic observations thus freed from disturbances, the places of the rejected ones are filled np by the most probable averages. In examining the results, the first large change appeared, having a period of eleven years. This had been, previously, well made out by General Sabine, in the disclll1'$ion of the resnJts of the British observations in the great combined system with which these Girard College observations had been connected. The agreement of this period, and of the disturbances with the period of the greatest number, and magnitude of the solar spots was traced, giving thus a glimpse of the meteorology of the sun by the study of these ehanges in the magnetism of the earth. Ta.king out these periodical changes, the results were next examined for daily, monthly, and yearly change. .A table being formed in which the hourly mean poaition. of the needle for each month is compared with the average position for the month, the faw of change from hour to hour, and from month to month, appears. The annual change from month to month follows the earth's

motion in its orbit. It is greater here in the winter than in the summer months. Taking this change as manifested from hour to hour in the twenty-four, it shows the points of greatest variation, the first between six and seven a. m., disappearing at a quarter before ten a. m.; the second, smaller than the first, at one o'clock p. m., disappearing shortly after five p. m.; and a third, still smaller, after nine p. m., disappearing half an hour before midnight. These changes cause the north end of the needle to be deflected more to the eastward in the summer about six or seven o'clock a. m., and more to the westward in winter. At about one o'clock p. m. they cause the north end of the magnet to be carried more to the westward in summer, and to the eastward in winter, and so cause an increase of apparent diurnal moYement in summer, and a diminution in winter. This amounts to between two and three minutes of arc at Philadelphia. Taking out the annual change and.its inequality, we can compute the mean annual value of the regular solar diurnal variation with an uncertainty, at the greatest, of but eleven seconds of arc. In the early morning hours the north end of the magnet moves to the eastward, reaching its least western deflection at about a quarter before eight a. m. It then returns westward, reaching its greatest western deflection at a quarter after one o'clock p. m., and again moves slowly to the eastward. The diurnal curve presents but a single wave, slightly interrupted by a deviation in the hourR near midnight. This, it will be perceived, is an important step in the theory of the sun's action on the magnet for the apparently double-headed curve of the day, that is, a curve with two maxima and two minima, has been reduced to a singleheaded one, or one with but a maximum and minimum. In other words, the solar magnetic tide of the day, instead of having, like the tides of the ocean, two flows and two ebbs in about twenty-four hours, has but one ebb and one flow, resembling the tides of the Gulf of Mexico, and not those of the .Atlantic. .And this is contrary to the appearance of things from the crude observations which presented two tides. After thus representing the changes of short period in the sun's action, that from year to year is deduced, and the res1dual numbers are arranged so as to represent the moon's action on the needle. The discussion of this constitutes the subject of the next paper, Appendix No. 24, in which are shown, following, as before, the methods of discussion of Sabine, Lloyd, and Kreil, the double lunar magnetic tide which takes place in the lunar day, and amounting to some twenty-four seconds of arc; the single tide in the same day, which, combined with the former, gives the observed magnetic tide; the inequality corresponding to a solar year; the probable changes of position at the change and full; and the doubtful effect of the moon's position north or south of the equator, or of the moon's distance from the earth. This exhausts the subject as far as we now perceive, and reduces the residual quantities to numbers corresponding to the probable errors of the quantities used. The connection of the solar spots with magnetic disturbances, and general changes of magnetic declination having been made out with a very reasonable degree of probability, I have not hesitated. to avail myself of Assistant Schotes offer to observe regularly the solar spots after the method of Carrington and Wolf. They a.re observed by projecting the sun's image upon a screen, and drawings are made of the sun's disk for position and number of spots, and also of the several spots in detail. The mode of observing, and the results for seven months, are given in Appendix No. 25, in Mr. Schott's report. This is an interesting contribution to general physi-Os, having a. direct bearing also upon our magnetic results.
MAGNETIC STATIONS AT KEY WEST AND EASTPORT.

Two magnetic stations have been established, which, in communication with the magnetic observatory of the University ot Mississippi, will fumish the required corrections for our Atlantic and Gulf magnetic observations. The observations at these stations will be in connection with the new series d observations contemplated under the direction· of the British

government. The Key West station is established in connection with the Smithsonian Insti· tution, and the instruments are those which were furnished for the obliervatory in the Smith· sonian grounds. The report of Professor Trowbridge, who established the station at Key West, gives a full account of the station due to the liberality of the Engineer department and its fitting up ; of the instruments, their mounting and adjustment; of the determinations of their scales and corrections; of the method of applying photography to the registration of the magnetic results; of the experiments to determine the constants of the instruments and the magnetic constants of the station; the provisions made for the continuance of absolute obs.er· vations of declination, dip, and intensity, with portable instruments, and of the differential observations of the magnetic elements by the photographic registry of results, and the like.(See Appendix No. 26.) I have judged it expedient to publish this report in full, as it will be useful in the case of establishing similar stations in the United States. The photographic traces are now regularly received at the office of the Coast Survey in Washington. The station at Eastport, Maine, is combined with a tidal station, and is for absolute determi· nations, on four days of each month, of the declination, dip, and intensity. The observations were commenced in January, 1860. The Appendix No. 27 contains a memorandum in reference to the station by Assistant L. F. Pourtales. A continuation of the list of determinations for magnetic declination, dip, and intensity, given in my report for 1858, is contained in the Appendix (No. 28) of this report, and an additional list giving the results of determinations made by Assistant C. A. Schott, in Ap· pendi:x. No. 29.
GULF STREAM.

The results of the Coast Survey explorations of the Gulf Stream, in as condensed a form as I have been able to give them, are contained in Appendix No. 17, being the substance of a lecture delivered before the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and by their request. The progress, especially of the temperature inve'stigations, those most characteristic of the stream, is stated under the following heads: · I. Type curves of law of temperature, with depth, at· the most characteristic positions. II. Type curves of disturbance of temperature across the 8tream. (a) Curves of temperature at the same depths. (b) Curves of depths at the same temperature. III. The cold wall. The diagrams will enable the reader to follow the different statements made in the lecture, and the final description of the stream from the Gulf of Mexico to the parallel of forty, north latitude, will be understood by the general map, (No. 21,) which is the last of the Gulf Stream plates. This summary, though drawn from previous discussions in my reports, presents the subject in a more methodh::al way than I have heretofore been able to handle it, and so may be useful to navigators who desire to become familiar with this important feature of the coast naviga· tion, so as to subject its peculiarities of warmth and current to their uses.
FORMULA:, ETC.

For the purposes of the field parties, tables of the form given in Appendix No. S6 a.re used in computing latitudes and longitudes from the triangulation, and they are now presented for practical use to avoid the necessity for frequent copying, which bas been hitherto required of the Computing Division of the office in order to meet the calls for them. In the discussion of physical problems, frequent application is made of formulro for interpolation. The formulre of Cauchy b~ing very useful. in many cases, a notice of them has b~en prepared by Assistant C. A. Schott, accompanied by an example for illustr·tion, '\.yb,ich will be found in Appendix No. 37.

To facilitate the construction of contour lines on the plane-table sheets in localities in which the surface level is much broken, the table in Appendix No. 38 has been computed by Mr. Schott. It is based on the units of length actually in use, and will be found convenient for the purposes intended by topographers generally.
REIGaTs.

In conjunction with the Smithsonian Institution, we have been engaged for some years in endeavoring to obtain all the data existing for heights in North America. During the past year a new circular has been issued to the engineers, presidents and superintendents of rail· roads, and to geologists, explorers, and other men of science, to obtain additional re1mlts, and with much success. To the entire number issued, two hundred and fifty replies have been received. These furnish data for the height above tide of about thirteen thousand points, of which a large portion has been contributed by the explorations for routes for the Pacific railroad, and a considerable number by other surveys of the government. The material received has been mapped by Mr. W. L. Nicholson, who is charged with the detaHs of the work, so as to indicate whether the data were likely to suffice for the construction of ccmtour lines of the surface of the continent, and to show where they would be deficient for that purpose. Sources of information have been pointed out, of which we have not yet been fully able to avail ourselves, but the work has, in a general way, made good progress, and will be earnestly prosecuted.

During the year a series of very elaborate experiments has been in progre~s under the general directionof Assistant J.E. Hilgard, by Mr. W. L. Nicholson and Mr. Joseph Saxton, of the Weights and Measures, assisted by Mr. Thomas McDonnell, on the comparison of the standard bar, used as a comparing bar in the base apparatus, with the standiird metre, and also on the expansion of the standard bar by heat. These are very laborious and difficult experiments, and the details are not yet ripe for a report.
INSTRUMENTS AND APPARATUS.

As promised in my last report, the apparatus for deep-sea soundings, invented by Professor Trowbridge, has been tried in the soundings across the Gulf Stream, from the Tortugas to the southward and westward, and then to the coast of Cuba, west of Havana. The results are very satisfactory, and Professor Trowbridge is now enga.g~d iu adapting the invention to one of the vessels of the survey for regular use. Assistant Henry Mitchell has invented two ingenious instruments for bringing up specimens of mud and sand from below the surface of the bottom on shoals, &c., at moderate depths. They are figured in Sketch No. 40, and described in Appendix No. 39. Mr. J9hn R. Gilliss, temporarily employed in, the Tidal Division, has invented a three-arm divider for decomposing tidal curves, which is quite a labor.saving piece of apparatus. .A. drawing is shown on Sketch No. 40, and the method of applying the instrument in Appendix No. 40. .
OFFICERS OF THE ARMY.

Lieutenants W. G. Gill, Geo. Bell, N. H. McLean, Wm. Craig, and O. D. Greene, have been detailed for coaat tJervice within the year. Lieuts. Gill, Bell, Craig, and Greene, are atta<?hed to field parties to give them training as chiefs of triangulation parties, and Lieut. lrrlcLean has been assigned to the office. Orders were issued detaching Lieut. Hill from the survey, but, cat my earn.eat request, the Hon. Secretary of War allowed him to temain until after the close of tlte session of Congress, his services being of specie.I importance in tbe oftice;

and the period of Lieut. Terrill's service was extended, on my application, by the same officer, to that established by the regulations of the War Department. Lieut. Thos. Wilson has been in charge of the Drawing Division, in place of Lieut. Tidball; Lieut. J. R. Smead, of the Engraving Division, in place of Lieut. Saxton; and Lieut. N. H. McLean, in charge of the Miscellaneous Division, in place of Lieut. Roy. Lieuts. Tidball, Saxton, and Roy, as stated in my last report, have been relieved from service on the Coast Survey. The names of the officers of the army now serving on the Coast Survey are given in Appen· dix No. 3.
OFFICERS OF THE NAVY.

The following changes have taken place in the officers of the navy attached to the Coast Survey during the past year: Lieutenant Guthrie has taken the place of Lieutenant T. B. Huger, in command of the steamer Walker. Lieut. Washington Gwathmey, Passed Assistant Surgeon James Suddards, and Midshipman F. B. Blake, have been detached, and Lieut. W. Ronckendorff and Lieut. Silas Bent have been attached. The first-named officer has commanded the schooner Arago, and the latter named is attached to the office, rendering very useful service in the Hydrographic Division in the revision of charts, for which his experience and qualifications are of a high order. Other changes which have been effected at the close of the surveying season, as operating more particularly on the service of the coming year, will be more properly stated in my next report. .A complete list of the officers of the navy on Coast Survey service, September 1, 1860, is give~ in the Appendix No. 5. The inspection and repairs of the vessels used in the survey have been continued under the charge of Commander S. S. Lee, whose zeal and industry I have already had occasion to recognize.
AIDS TO NAVIGATION.

The recommendations of the chiefs of hydrogrnphic parties in relation to beacons, buoys, &c., will be found in .Appendix No. 43. They have generally been reported at the time of receiving them, through the Treasury Department, to the Light-house Boa.rd.
OBITUARIES ·

.Assistant Wilson Y. C. Fairfax, who died on tho 8th of August, 1860, entered the Coast Survey under my predecessor in 1843. He was educated at West Point, and combined the rare qualities of field a.nd office usefulness. It was in the latter capacity that he proposed to serve; and as a topographical draughtsman he was without a superior in the country, perhaps in the world. Combining a full mastery of theory with the feeling of the artist, his work was in accuracy and in effect of the highest order. His laborious habits and conscientious modes of action made him an example to his juniors in the service, while his amiable and retiring character secured their g-0od will. With characteristic :fidelity his la.hors and his life· ended almost together. He died at the age of sixty·two years· .Assistant John Seib, who entered the survey in 1'848, and was one of its most industrious and competent topographers, died suddenly in Washington, on his way to section V, on the 23d of December, 1859. Hr. Seib was one of those men who are exclusively devoted to their professional occnpa.tioos, finding their pleasure in constant employment. Hence a.11 his pcnyers were concentrated ap9n hie work, and he was always with rare intervals in the field. His· amiable charaeter ma.de him generally r~etted. Mr. J. V. N. Throop, long known in W~iogton as an engraver of skill, has for many JleMS worked on contracts for the Coast Survey, imci :for StWeral been regularly engaged in ihe. otliee. His health has failed within the Ui.st two y~ .and· he. died, after much auffering, oa the ad 11f July, 1860. ·

Mr~ E. H. Fauntleroy, a young man of great promise, and son of one of the most efficient assistants, whose loss it was the misfortune of the Coast Survey to deplore at an early period in its progress, died suddenly at San Francisco, on the 25th of May, 1860, in the performance of his duties as aid in the party of Assistant Davidson. From the date of his entrance on the survey, in 1858, Mr. Fauntleroy had shown himself especially adapted to the profession of his choice. Possessing all the qualities that adorn private life, he had the rare fortune to unite them with abilities of the most promising order. His untimely death, after a brief career of usefulness, has proved as well a loss to the work under my superintendence, as a source of lively regret to the chief with whom he was associated.

PART II.
The detailed account is next to be given of the work in the field, afloat, and in the office, arranged in the order of geographical sections, and under each section under the sub-divisions of field-work, including geodesy, topography, and bydrography; and of office-work, including computations, drawing, and engraving of maps and charts.

Special observations on the currents of Boston harbor, and on the tides and currents of Cape Cod bay and Buzzard's bay. These were made in connection with hydrographic resurveys for separate commissions having in charge the special interests of navigation in the two localities. 20. The establishment of a magnetic station at Eastport, Me., and determination of the magnetic elements at several stations on Cape Cod peninsula. 21. Tidal observations. Ojfice-work.-The drawing and engraving of coast map and chart No. 14:, from Buzzard's bay to Block island; the drawing of the chart of Portland harbor; and the engraving of preliminary sea-coast chart No. 4, from Cape Cod to Saughkonnet Point, have been completed; as also the engraving of charts of Rockport harbor, Lynn harbor, Muskeget channel,(new edition.) and additions to the progress sketches and plates of charts issued in former years. Progress has been made in the drawing and engraving of preliminary sea-coast chart No. 3, from Cape Small Point to Cape Cod; also on coast maps and charts Nos. 8 and 9, from Seguin island to Cape Ann; on No. 11, from Plymouth harbor to Hyannis harbor; in the drawing of preliminary sea-coast chart No. 2, from Isle au Haut (Penobscot bay) to Cape Elizabeth; in that of the charts of the Sheepscot and Kennebec rivers; on coast map and chart No. 7, from Muscongus bay to Portland harbor; and in the engraving of coast maps and charts Nos. 12 and 13, from Monomoy to Martha's Vineyard. Geoddic, astronomical, a.nd magnetic obaervations.-The party under my immediate direction was organized early in June to continue the primary triangulation of the coast of New Hamp· $hire a.nd Massachusetts. The preliminaries required in the erection of signals and posting the heliotropers were attended to, as heretofore, by Assistant G. W. Dean, and the preparations required for occupying the stations were made, as usual, by Mr. Thomas McDonnell. Station Gu~tock, in the township of Gilford, Belknap county, New Hlilmpshire, was first occupied. The measurement of horizontal angles was commenced there on the 11th of July; and the weather continuing :unusually favorable, the work advanced rapidly until the 15th of August, at which date the various operations were satisfactorily completed. Arrangements were made for the immediate transfer of the party and instruments to station Wach118ett mountain, situated in East Princeton township, Worcester ~ounty, Massachusetts. While the preliminary preparations were. being made at W achusett, Assistant Dean, aided by Sub-Assistant R. E. Halter .a.n~ 111. R. H. TalcottJ measured the necessary a.ngles at the station on Unkonoonuc mQUnt$n.for ~in lfont1,.Qnoo with the series of primary triangles. The operations &t Gunstock included the measurement of twenty-three horizontal a.ogJes

with the thirty-inch theodolite; vertical angles with the eight-inch Gambey circle, C. S. No. 57, upon nine stations; azimuth with the large theodolite; determinations for latitude with the zenith telescope;. occult.ations of the Pleiades observed on the night of July 13, and the eclipse of the sun on the 18th of that month, for longitude purposes; the determination of the magnetic elements; and the usual meteorological observations. These, in connection with other operations, will be noticed in more detail presently. During the latteI· part of the season the weather was not so favorable for work as it had been in July and August. The measurement of horizontal angles at station Wachusett was begun on the 13th of September, and by the 16th of October the geodetic, astronomical, and magnetic observations were completed. Primary triangUlation.-At station Gunsfock eleven hundred and thirteen observations were made with the thirty-inch theodolite, C. S. No. 1, upon ten signals and an elongation mark. The heights of the stations connecting with it were determined from six hundred and fifty-four measurements of vertical angles with the eight-inch Gambey vertical circle, C. S. No. 57. At Unkonoonuc station four hundred and thirteen measurements were made with the large theodolite, on three signals, for the horizontal angles. At W achusett eleven hundred and seventy observations with the same theodolite were recorded. These were made on ton primary signals and the elongation mark, and the heights of nine of the stations were ascertained by three hundred aud fifty measurements of the vertical angles. The most distant signals observed on during the season wore those on Gunstock and Waohusett, being about seventy-six miles from each other in a direct line. Five others upon which measurements were made were from fifty-five to seventy miles apart, and tho average distance of the remaining ones was forty miles. The relative positions of the several stations may be seen by reference to Sketch No. 1. The area embraced within the completed triangles, estimated in the usual way, iR thirty-six hundred square miles. Latitude.-With the zenith telescope, C. S. No. 5, three hundred and twenty-eight observations were made at Gunstock on forty-seven sets of stars, and the arc value of the micrometer was carefully determined from one buudred and twenty-two readings on Polaris and sixty readings on star No. 240 B. A. Catalogue, near their eastern elongation. The local time was ascertained from two hundred observations made with the twenty-four inch transit, C. S. No. 10, on forty-two 2enith and circumpolar stars. At station W achusett three hundred and twenty-two opservations with the zenith instrument were recorded, forty-six pairs of stars being used. The arc value of the micrometer was ascertained from one hundred and eighty observations upon Polaris, near e'!stern elongation, and the divisions of the level were determined in the usual manner with the micrometer. The local time was obtained from one hundred and six observations of zenith and circumpolar stars. The observations·for latitude and time were made by Sub-Assistant J. H. Toomer, aided by Mr. Hen:ry W. Bache. Longitude.-Arrangements were perfected in advance for obser\ring the occultations of t.be Pleiades at Gunstock mountain in July. On the night of the 13th of that month the times of the immersion and emersion of four of the group were carefully noted. Special preparations were also made for observing all the phases of the solar eclipse of July 18 at the same station; and for this purpose the necessary astronomical, magnetic, and meteorol~giea.l instruments were adjusted, and hourly observations of the ~agnetic declination and horizontal force, in connection with the requisite meteorological readmgs, W'3re commenced on the morning of the 16th, and continued until the evening of the 20th of July. For several days, and at times corresponding with the duration of the eclipse, the observations were recorded every two minutes. The weather at Gunstock 011 the morning of the 18th was 5 c

remarkably favorable, and the observations of the eclipse during its progress made by myself and assistants 1yere quite satisfactory. At station W acbusett arrangements \·rnre made for observing the occultations of the Pleiades on the night of October 3, but unfortunately a dense fog prevented. Azimuth.-The astronomical meridian and the bearings of the trigonometrical lines at stations Gun stock and achusett were determined in the usual way with the thirty-inch theodolite. At the first-named station ninety observations were made on Polaris, near its eastern elongation, and eighty-four on J Ursre ll:finoris, near its upper culmination, in connection with on.e hundred and fifty-six readings on the elongation mark. ' The azimuth at Wadrnsett was ascertained from ninety observations on Polaris, near eastern elongation, and seventy-two on l Ursru Minoris, near the upper culmination, in addition to one hundred and sixty observations on t.he elongation mark. Magnetic observations.-At Gunstock a magnetic station was chosen. near .the summit of the mountain, in a northerly direction from the geodetic station. In determining the declination, five lmndred observations were made on six days, and for the inclination of the needle five complete sets of observations were recorded from a nine-inch dip circle. The horizontal intensity was deduced from three sets of deflections and vibrations on three days, and the horizontal force from three hundred and ten readings of a Bifilar magnet · .At Wachusett one hundred and thirty-three observations were made, to determine the mag· netic declination, on three days, and the inclination was deduced from three sets on three days. The horizontal intensity and moment of inertia were determined from four sets on four days. The instruments used at Gunstock were declinometer C. S. No. 6, dip circle C. S. No. 9, and Bifilar magnet C. S. No. 4. A.tWachusett, declinometer D. (22 C. S. No. l) and dip circle C. S. No. 4 were used. The &zimuth and magnetic observations were made by Assistant Dean; Sub-Assistant R. E. Halter and Mr. R. H. Talcott assisted in that duty. Meteorological observations.-The usual journals were kept during the season by Mr. Talcott, who recorded four hundred and three readings of the barometer and wet and dry bulb thermometers. A.11 the original records were duplicated, and the reductions made of latitude, azimuth, and magnetic observations before the party left the field. Assistant Dean is about to resume the longitude determinations in Section VIL Triangulation of Passamaquoddy bay, Me.-The secondary triangulation of the coast of Maine, near the northeastern boundary, was taken up by Assistant C. 0. Boutelle in the first week of September, and is based on the reconnaissance made by him last year. As laid out for execution, the scheme of triangulation (Sketch No. 2) includes the coast lying north and east of a line from Cross island, to the southern head of Grand Manan, and the whole of Cobscook bay. It also embraces the western shore of Grand Manan, Campo Bello, and Deer island, and the smaller islands between East Quoddy Head and Letite Passage, with the eastern shore of the St. Croix river, from St. Andrew's to the town of St. Stephen. The progress made within these limits furnishes data sufficient for a season's topography. Lieut. George Bell, U. S· .A., efficiently assisted Mr. Boutelle in the field-work. Two first order signals, six of the second, and fifteen of the third order, liave been put up, and sites selected for stations, the lines between which will include the whole of Quoddy bay · .A summary of statistics is here given as taken from the report of Assistant Boutelle :

Lieut. Bell has been assigned to duty on the coast of Texas. Triangukition ef Frenchman's bay, Me.-ln the vicinity of the Epping base, and connected with it, Sub-Assistant F. P. Webber laid out, in August, a secondary triangulation to include Frenchman's bay and the adjacent coast of Maine. This work extends from Pigeon Hill primary station to Mt. Desert island, southward and westward along the coast, and northward to the town of Sullivan, at the head of the bay. Full provision was made in its progress in the determination of third order points for the plane-table survey. Messrs. Julius Kincheloe and G. U. Mayo aided in the field-work. The party used the schooner Ha~sler for transportation in this and in another locality of the section, to which reference will be made presently. For plane·table purposes the positions of twenty-seven points were determined.

The limits of the triangulation may be seen by Sketch No. 2.
Mr. Webber closed work for the season on the 28th of September. In addition to the fieldwork, he has revised and forwarded his notes and records, and furnished computations of his results. Notes of the horizontal angles determined in connecting the Epping base with the primary triangulation, and others made in running a line of levels at Pigeon Hill, were sent to the office by Assistant Boutelle before taking the field. for work at the south. Triangulat£on ef Penobscot bay, .iJie.-In pursuance of a scheme laid out and matured last season, Sub-Assistant J. A. Sullivan took the field in May, and completed observations on the signals erected in the lower part of Penobscot bay. The secondary triangulation of the coast of Maine is now continuous eastward to Isle au Hant, and includes within the limits of the work here noticed the islands at the entrance of the bay. The progress made is shown on Sketch No. 2. As the work vrnnt on, attention was given to the requirements for the planetable survey, and points were selected sufficient. for tracing the shore-line as far up as the vicinity of Camden, and the outlines of the islands between Rockland and Isle au Haut. Sub.Assistant Sullivan was aided in the field by Messrs. McLane Tilton and J. D. Bradford. The angular measurements were completed on the 27th of June. On closing work, the schooner Peirce, which had been in the service of the triangulation party, was laid up at Belfast. l\lr. Sullivan then took up the necessary computations.

The ten-inch No. 31 and eight-inch theodolite No. 57 were used in determining the angles . . Soon after leaving the field, Sub-Assistant Sullivan made and turned in the computations of his work, with the original record of angles and descriptions of the stations occupied by the party while under his charge. Ou the 3d of September Assistant G. A. Fairfield, with the two aids of the party, took up and continued the work in Penobscot bay, establishing the third order points for topography between Owl's Head and Turkey signal, and for the survey of Rockland harbor. He also completed the measurement of angles in the secondary triangulation below Camden. The

instrument used by him was a new ten-inch theodolite (No. 91) furnished for trial by G. W. Blunt, Esq., of New York; and in reference to the results obtained with it, Mr. Fairfield says: "Of the five angles determined at Fox Rocks station, one was measured last year by Sub.Assistant Sullivan, the rest by myself with theodolite No. 91. They close the circle within 11 '.09, au<l the angles measured with it that fill triangles were very close." The triangulation executed by Mr. Fairfield has been computed, checked, and the results and duplicate records have been forwarded to the office.

Assistant Fairfield is preparing to return and continue duty near Cape Sable, Florida. Triangulation <!l the St. Gr.orge' s, ~~:fcdomalc, Damariscotta, Kennebec, and Androscoggin rivers, Me.-In July, Sub-A.s;:.istant Webber, aided by Messrs. Kincheloe and Mayo, extended the secondary triangulation of l\fuscongus bay northward, so as to furnish points for the plane-table survey of the rivers connected with it. Positions were determined for the topography of the St. George as far up as Thomaaton, on the shores of the Mcdomak to 'Valdoboro', and the triangulation was extended up the Damariscotta to K cwcastle. That on St. George's river was carried to a junction with the secondary triangulation in Penobscot bay. Mr. Webber also furnished points for completing the topography of Merrymeeting bay, and for the planetable survey of the Androscoggin river to Brunswick. The triangulation party moved from this vicinity and took up work at Frenchman's bay, as already stated. A.t eight of his stations west of the Penobscot Mr. Webber measured vertical angles on twenty-eight objects, and recorded three hundred P_nd forty-four observations. The ten·inch Gambey, C. S. No. 63, and six-inch Brunner theodolite, C. S. No. 52, were used in this triangulation.

The occupation of Sub-Assistant Webber's party in the schooner Hassler, during the winter and spring of the surveying year, will be stated nuder Section V. He is now making arrangements for returning to the southern coast. Mr. Kincheloe has been assigned to duty on the coast of California. Topography between tlte Sheepscot and Kennebec rive-rs, Jfe.-Plane-table duty was resumed on the shores of the Sheepscot river by Assistant I. Hull Adams in the latt.er part of July, and continued under his charge until the 7th of August, when he was relieved in the charge of the party by Sub-Assistant Charles Ferguson. Mr. .Adams connected his plane-table sheet of the river with the survey of the vicinity of Wiscasset, by Sub-Assistant W. H. Dennis, and then traced part of the shore-line of Oren's Mouth bay. Sub-Assistant Ferguson took up the topography on Westport island, on the west side of the Sheepscot, at a point abont six miles below Wiscasset, (Sketch No. 2,) and continued it

northerly and halfway across the island, making a connection with the work of the previous year. He then proceeded with the survey of the shores of Back river, completing also that of the adjacent side of Westport island, and including six miles or about two-thirds of its entire length. On the western side of Back river the shore-line was traced from Cushman Hill, six miles southward, or nearly to the entrance into the Kemiebec. The shores of a branch called Moutseag river, coming in on the same side, were also surveyed as far up as Shaddocks' bridge. "Back river varies from one-fourth of a mile to a mile in width, runs nearly parallel to the Kennebec, and has one entrance into that river about eight miles below Wiscasset.

present condition of the more exposed portions of the outer harbor. By comparison with the former surveys, it will enable the United States commissioners approximately to estimate the progress of destrucLion within the last thirteen years, and roughly to show what those islands were in form and dimensions before the trees and vegetation which once protected them were removed. The materials furnished by the wear of these islands are placed at the disposal of the currents and waves for the. formation or increase of bars and shoals. Mr. Whiting was assisted in this work by Messrs. C. Rockwell and Charles Hosmer. The party used the schooner Torrey for transportation. Topography between Cape Cod bay and the head of Buzzai·d' s bay, .i'Jfass.-This work was done at the expense of a committee empowered by the legislature of Massachusetts to determine the practicability of a ship canal across the Cape Cod peninsula. The details were com· menced in the middle of August by Sub.Assistant W. H. Dennis, and tho survey was mainly executed by him, a portion of the preliminary work only having been supplied from a planetable sheet of .Assistant A. M. Harrison. The survey of Mr. Dennis embraced the narrow valley of about eight miles in length, through which flow the Scusset and Monumet rivers-the first into Cape Cod bay, and the last named into the upper part of Buzzard's bay, (Sketch 2.) AU the details were minutely filled in on the scale of roto- 0 , to meet and apswer such purposes as the commission might be called upon to execute in connection with the proposed improvement.

In the progress of the work the soundings required to complete the hydrography of the Sheepscot river were made, and supplementary work executed between it and Damiscove island, to include Booth bay, and also the harbor of that name. It will be seen by Sketch No. 2 that the hydrographic sheet of this season completes the in-shore hydrograpby of the coaet of

Maine eastward nearly to the entrance t>f Penobscot bay. This work was resumed by the party in charge of Lieut. Comg. Phelps on the 6th of August, and continued until the 1st of October. At Damiscove island the soundings j<)in with the hydrography executed by tbe parties of Lieut. Comg. Bankhead and Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson. A mile and a quarter S.SW. :! W. (true) from Pemaquid light-house, Lieut. Comg.

Hydrography cf Damariscotta river and Liniken's 'bay, .lJie.-Connecting the work at Damiscove island with the in-shore hydrography mentioned under the last head, Lieut. Comg. J, P. Bankhead, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, with his party in the schooner Crawford, sounded out the approaches and extended the hydrographic Emrvey of the Damariscotta river to a point twelve miles above the line of junction with the hydrography of Lieut. Comg. Phelps. This survey takes in J~iniken's bay, and has developed many dangerous reefs and ledges outside of the entranqe of the Damariscotta. l<'or the reduction of soundings the tides were observed by the hydrographic party night and day during a period of six weeks. Lieut. Comg. Bankhead commenced work on the 20th of July, and completed the survey within the limits of his projection by the 10th of September.

The following remark is taken from the report of Lieut. Conig. Bankhead: "The want of a correct chart of that locality (entrance of the Damariscotta) is much felt, and the d~sire that one should soon be published was frequently expressed to me by the coasters and fishermen belonging in the vicinity." The part of the river included in the survey of this season is shown on Sketch No. 2. Lieut. Comg. Bankhead was engaged in the hydrography of Section V during the first half of the working season, and is now preparing to return tl1ere to continue duty on the coast of Florida and Georgia. Early in the present surveying year the original sheet of soundings made between Cape Small and Damiscove island, by the party of Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson, was received at the office, with the records of soundings, angles, and tidal observations. The journals of the work done last year in Casco bay have also been turned in. Jeffrey' B bank.-This bank extends about twenty-fl.even nautical miles in a northeast and southwest direction, and lies off the entrance to Penobscot bay, at a distance of about thirtyfive miles. The bank itself was sounded out and developed in contour by Lieut. Comg. Phelps, wit.h the steamer Vixen, in the beginning of October. The least depth found was forty-six fathoms, within an approximate distance of about twenty-eight miles from Matinicus

light. The position of the bank is marked on Sketch No. 2. Sixty-three casts were made on it with the lead. Je;tfrey's ledge.-This hydrographic feature of the coast of New Eugland was developed in September last by Lieut. Comg. John Wilkinwn, U. S. N., with the steamer Corwin. Traverse lines were run across it, and a line of soundings along its axis, which stretches nearly fifty nautical miles abreast of the coast. In sixty-four soundings the least depth found was thirty fathoms, at a p<>int near the middle of the ledge. The position of Jeffrey's ledge is marked on the progref'.s Sketch No. 2. Deep-sea soundings.-Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson, in the steamer Corwin, in the early part of September, carried a line of soundings from Cape Ann, northward and eastward, to the vicinity of Seal island, N. S., but there encountering a severe gale was compelled to scud, and so was unable to make soundings iu returning to the coast. In a run outward of two hundred miles, sixty-three casts were made with the lead. The greatest depth found was Dne hundred and ninety-five fathoms, in the meridian of Damiscove island. The line was interrupted at a position about twenty-five miles southwest of Seal Island light. Its course is marked on Sketch No. 1. The original sheet containing the off-shore souudings made last year by Lieut. Comg. Murray, between the Isles of Shoal and Seal island, and the chart of in-shore work from Cape Elizabeth to Kennebunkport, have been completed, and registered at the office. Re-examinationqf B08ton harbor forchanges.-At the request of the United States commissioners on Boston harbor, and at the cost of the municipal authorities, a resurvey was made during last summer of the inner harbor, and an examination in the main channel of the outer harbor, for compari&on with the hydrography of 1847. These surveys were made by Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson, in the steamer Corwin. The comparative map of the inner harbor, showing the changes since the survey of Lieut. Comg. Charles H. Davis, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, in 1847, is of great value, indicating the direction and amount of change, and in conjunction with the current and other physical observations, the causes of those changes. The steamer Corwin was placed at the disposal of the commissioners to make personal examinations of portions of the harbor where changes of importance had occurred. While engaged in the special duty alluded to in Boston harbor, Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson discovered a rock dangerous to navigation for vessels of largo draught in passing through the narrows. It was found near the middle of' the channel, and in four fathoms water, its crest rising to a peak, with only seventeen feet of water on it at mean low tide, or fifteen feet and three-tenths at low water of spring tides. The bearings and ranges from this obstacle to navigation, which I have called, after the name of the vessel, Corwin Bock, were published in the usual form, in September last, as a notice to mariners.-(See Appendix No. 10.) Hydrography qf Gape Cod bay, Mass.-In the immediate vicinity of the mouth 'of Scusset river a minute hydrographic survey was made with the b<>ats of the steamer Corwin, by the party of Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson, in the latter part of September. The soundings were carried about half a mile south and east, and two miles north and west of the mouth <>f the river, and extended rather more than two miles outward from the shore of Cape Cod bay. A tidal station was established by the hydrographic party near the point occupied for observations by Assistant Mitchell, his bench-mark being used in determining a plane of reference for the soundings. On the completion of the work the steamer Corwin returned to Boston.

This hydrography was executed iu compliance with a request from commissioners who hr-we under consideration the practicability of a ship canal to connect the waters of Cape Cod bay and Buzzard's bay so as to avoid the sea navigation by the Nantucket shoals. Hydrography qf the Nantucket slwals.-My attention having been called by George W. Blunt, esq., of New York, to the existence of a rip southeast of Davis's shoal, reported by the commander of the steamship Asia, Lieut. Comg. Phelps wa& instructed to examine the locality, and did so in the latter part of October, after closing work in the northern part of the section. In prosecuting this duty an extensive shoal was discovered outside, and to the northeastward of the rip in question, and both are thus 1 eferred to by Lieut. Comg. Phelps: "Near the position given by the captain of the Asia is a well-defined rip corresponding to his description, 'about a mile long, and a quarter vf a mile broad,' with eleven fathoms water on it." "About half a mile eastward of the rip lies the south point of a shoal, which extends about N.NE. a distance of six and a half nautical miles, with ten to ten and a half fathoms in several places. Both shoals are distinctly marked as well on the flood as on ebb tides, with deep and smp Jth water between them.'' "These shoals lie between the latitudeR 40° 4G' and 40° 53' N., and longitudes 69° 19' and 69c 25' W., and about twenty-four miles from Davis's south shoal light-boat."-(See Appendix No. 11.) Tides and cun·ent.s qf Boston liar"bor.-A physical examination of Boston harbor and approaches was commenced during the past season, under the direction of the harbor commissiouers, and at the expense of the city of Boston. Inquiries have been instituted relative to the action of tides, currents, waves, and other natural agencies, upon the channels and basins. It is designed by tl1is investigation to determine definitely the causes of the contraction of the cliannels aud the iucrease of the flats, which has been going on for many years, and which threatens to destroy the port. With the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury, the party of Assistant Henry Mitchell was sent with the schooner Bailey to execute this work. Operations were commenced in the latter part of July, and continued until late in the autumn. Mr. Mitchell reports the occupation of about sixty current stations and ten tidal stations, together with a large number of special examinations of deposits, of temperaturP,s at different depths, of specific gravities of land and sea water, and some chemical experiments. Varied as these observations have been, the results show that pra<:tical objects have been kept steadily in view, and that our study would not be complete without all of them. At nearly all the current stations the observations were extended to two, three, or \.'Ven four different depths, in order that no movement of the sea might escape notice, and that the precise amount of scouring power exerted upon the channel-bed might be measured. The importance of this careful scrutiny is illustrated by many of the results. It was found that the upper stratum-that lying above the level of the flats and shoals-mailltains to a great degree an independent movement often at variance with that of deeper strata. The tidal stations were mostly occupied for short series of observations only; although in one case, that of the station at Boston lower light·house, the ob£ervations were kept up filx weeks. The examinations were commenced at a point three miles seaward of the lower light, and extended in a more or less connected chain to the head of Mystic river. In Mystic river, and in the ponds at its source, some very curious results were obtained, bearing upon the mutual action of fresh and salt watel' upon each other. It was ascertained that distinct strata of water exist in the 1ower Mystic pond, whose specific gravities, tempera.tu.res, and chemical constitutions present striking contrasto. This pond is some seventy feet in depth. Th~ Ufiper sixteen feet is apparently pure fresh water; below this a narrow belt of

6 c

42

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

salt water is found; and yet lower, from the depth of twenty feet to the bottom, a mass of sulphurous salt water· exist!3, which is highly offensive to taste and smell. The hydrometer gave something like regular variations in the densities for different depths; but our thermometers gave us sharp contrasts of temperatures between the sulphurous stratum and the water above. Chemical tests for sulphur were unaffected above a plane lying 19. 9 feet below the surface. Bands of copper, allowed to hang vertically from a float, were found, aft.er a few hours, to be blackened below the plane mentioned, and the limit of the sulphuretted portion was sharply defined. The observations on the action of waves were made by noting the changes of position of articles placed on the sJ10res. Those articles were of different forms and specific gravities, so that the comparative forces of the waves created by differ11nt storms could be measured. Unfortunately for these inquiries, the quiet season offered no opportunity for any remarkable observations. Trials were made, however, with some success at Lovell's, Gallop's, and Deer islands, as we11 as at Brewster bar and Point Shirley. Some few computations that have been made of the current observations by the Coast Su r'ley method show that when this work is complete the causes of trouble in Boston harbor may be defined accurately. As was anticipated at the commencement of this investigation, a second season's work is absolutely necessary to develop the <let.ails of these operations. The burden of these observations fell principally upon the aids, whose untiring devotion to their work has secured these reliable results. The larger portion of the current observations in tbe harbor were made by Mr. Bright, while in the examination of the Mystic river; Mr. Heberton took charge of the records; Mr. Johnson discharged various duties, and made many observations. Ob.~ervations on tides and currents in Oape God bay and Buzzard' B bay, 1J1a88. -For the purposes and at the expense of a committee of the Massachusetts legislature, having in charge the question of determining on the practicability of a ship canal across the Cape Cod peninsula, series of observations were made )n the course of the summer at the mouth of Scusset river and in the adjacent parts of Cape Cod bay, and in Buzzard's bay, near the month of Back River harbor. These were conducted by Assistant Henry Mitchell, aided throughout by Mr. W. T. Bright, and during the latter part of the season by Mr. E. P. Heberton. In Cape Cod bay two tide-gauges were found necessary, in consequence of the great range in the rise and fal!, as well as the very gradual slope of the beach. One was placed at a dis· tance from the shore, supported by iron rods, so as to afford sufficient steadiness, and at the same time ~ secure from the disturbing effect of the waves. The second instrument was secured by a pile of the form devised by Mr. Mitchen, and described in Appendix No. 26 of my annual report for 1859. With these two gauges three thousand observations were recorded, comprising the high and low waters between the 17th of July and 18th of .August. Nearly double the number of oh1;ervations were taken in Back River harbor on an ordinary staffgauge, no peculiar structures being required in the quiet basin near the htiad of Buzzard's bay. On both sides of the peninsula tb~ simultaneous observations were referred to bench-marks cut on large rockil. Aseistant Mitcheil having observed that the temperature of the water was not the same in the two basins, the observers were provided with standard thermometers, and, during the last half of the tidal series, noted the temperaturel'. for comparison. Among the interesting results developed by Mr. Mitchell is tbe fact tha.t the tide wavea of tbe two bays, the shores of which are within eight miles of each other, were found not only dissimilar in ranges and epochs, but also in general figure; so that, on the supposition that the mean level of the sea is a plane common to both basins, the relative alternate, elevations and

depressions do not attain the same maximum in the two bays. The greatest depression of Cape Cod bay, below Buzzard's bay, occurs about one hour after low water of the former place, and &mounts, at an average, to 4.6G feet; whereas, about six hours later, Buzzard's bay reaches its greatest depression below Cape Cod bay, and the average difference of elevation is found to be 5. 79 feet. Hence, although the total interchanges of water through a canal connecting these basins would be nearly the same in both directions, (supposing the mean level the same,) the maximum velocity should appear before the current ceases to 1:>et westward. The currents of the two bays were also observed, the schooner Bailey having been assigned to the use of the party for that purpose. In Buzzard's bay four stations were occupied, and three in Cape Cod bay. The observations were made half-hourly, night and day, not only at the surface, but ako on the movements of the water at different depths; the usual length of each series being twenty-five hours, so as to embrace an entire tidal day. The changes in tho elevation of the beach of Cape Cod bay were observed by repeating long Jines of levellings after several easterly storms; and the movements of s~ingle were determined by recording the changes in position of articles deposited for the purpose, those selected being distinguishable from the material naturally thrown 11p. The current observations revealed the existence of a coast current which sweeps along the westerly part of Cape Cod bay, and there takes a course northward. In the vicinity of the mouth of Scusset river it is feeble, but it gathers considerable strength further to the north. With reference to this current, Assistant Mitchell remarks: ''The mo1:>t singular fact observed concerning this current was its low temperature during the warm season at which our observa· tions were made. While the mean tt:imperature of the water in Back River harbor (Buzz:ml's hay) attained a height of 73 degrees, or a little above that of the air in shade, the water of Cape Cod bay reached only 54 degrees.'' The observations show that the currents below are a little stronger than those at the surface in Cape Cod bay. At Scusset the levellings of the beach, though made only after moderate storms, did not show very large changes of elevation; hut the movement of shingle to the southward was noticed to be remarkably active at such times. The direct bearing of facts like those, which are here only partially alluded to, on the construction of a ship canal to join two seas, will be at once comprehended. Magnetic observatiom.-ln January last a magnetic station was established at Eastport, Maine, as a standard of comparison for the determinations made from time to time at other points on the northeastern coast of the United States. With the view of obtaining a con· tinuous series of observations the station was placed in charge of Mr. G. B. Vose, and furnished with a dip circle and magnetometer. Records have been regularly received, but the value of the observations was found to be impaired by the unsteadiness of the magnetic axis of the collimator. Assistant L. F. Pourtales visited the station in August, and remedied the defect on ascertaining its cause. His description of the station and instruments used is given in Appendix No. 27. At W ellfieet, Provincetow"Q, and Chatham, (Cape Cod peninsula,) Assistant Charles A. Schott occupied magnetic stations in August, and determined at each the declination, dip and intensity by independent results obtained on different days. These three aro the most northern in a series of ten stations at which observations were made during the month just named and the one following. Reference to the others will be made under Section 11. The instruments used were the Jones' magnetometer, C. S. No. 6, and the Barrow dip circle, 0. S. No. 9. Time was noted on the Hutton chronometer 211. At each station the astronomical azimuth and local time were determined by means of the theodolite of the magnetometer, mounted for the purpose on the same stand. In observing the sun's uppei; and lower, and first and second limb , six sets of observations of three readings each were recorded.

44

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

For the declination half-hourly readings were taken, extending generally from the morning minimum to the afternoon maximum. Two sets of vibrations, giving six separate resultR, in an aggregate of one hundred and :fifty vibrations, were taken each day for ascertaining the magnetic intensity. For the dip four sets were observed daily with needle No. 1, with verifying observations in the immediate vicinity of the station . .Assistant A. S. Wadsworth accompanied Mr. Schott and assisted in the observations. .Appendix No. 29 contains the results deduced from them for the stations on Cape Cod penirnmta and others in the adjoining section. The original record, with a duplicate and the first reduction of the observations, have been placed in the office by Assistant Schott. Tidal obse·rvati"ons.-Early in the present surveying yea1· a tidal station was established at Eastport, Maine. .A self-registering gauge has been put up there and kept in operation by Mr. G. B. Vose, who has also recorded observations from a tape or belt-gauge for comparison, the great height of the tide at Eastport rendering such a comparison a matter of necessity in deducing close results. The series of obserYations of high and low water at the Charlestown na\'Y yard, Mass , has been continued during the year with great regularity by Mr. T. E. Ready. It has now been maintained for thirteen years, with the loss of but very few observations, and the record, if kept up a few years longer with fidelity, will constitute one of the most valuable series of tidal observations that has ever been made in any country. So far the registers have been highly creditable to the observers, and have already furnished data which have been much wanted for theoretical investigations of the laws governing the tides. SECTION II.
FROM POINT JUDITH TO CAPE HENLOPEN, INCLUDING THE COA5'"T OF THE STATES OF CONNECTICUT, NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA, AND PART OF DELAWARE-(SnTcK B, No. 6.)

I have elsewhere referred to the wreck of the steamer Walker, on the 21st of June of the present, year. This disaster, which involved loss of life to twenty of her crew, with the total loss of the ve!'lsel and all the records on board, was occasioned by collision with a schooner laden with coal, and occurred about three o'clock in the morning, while the Walker was off Ahsccom, New Jersey, in command of Lieutenant J. J. Guthrie, U. S. N., and on her passage from Norfolk to New York. The officers of the Walker and 1mrvivors of her crew were rescued from imminent' peril by Captain L. J. Hudson, of the schooner R. G. Porter, and safely conveyed to May's Landing. on the coast of New Jersey. The steamer sunk in less than half an hour after the collision, which took place about twelve miles from land. Notices of the work done in this section will be arranged as follows: l. Reconnaisance for connecting the Epping base with the Fire island base, through direct 1ine. 2.

Office-work.-Progress has been made in the drawing and engraving of a map of the Hudson river from New York to Sing Sing, and on coast map and chart No. 21, New York bay and harbor. A chart of Hempstead harbor has been drawn and engraved, and the engraving of coast maps and charts Nos. 15, 16, and 17, Long Island sound, (new edition,) and No. 19, middle part of the southern coast of Long Island, has been completed. .Additions have been made to the progress sketch, a separate drawing has been made of Coenties' reef, and a new plate engraved for the chart of Captain's island, cast and west. In acknowledging the receipt of copies of some of the maps of this section used by him in adjusting a narrative of incidents connected with the revolutionary war, the following remark is made by Henry B. Dawson, esq., of lforrisania, N. Y.: "Hours and days have been spent in laborious investigations concerning apparent contradictions in descriptions of place;i, attacked, &c., which these maps would have shown in as many minutes, with greater certainty.'' Reconnaissance.-The occupation of 'Vachusett mountain, affording at the same time ready means in part for connecting the base on Epping plains with the one on Fire island beach through a direct series of triangles, As;:;istant 0. 0. Boutelle was detailed in June to select the stations necessary for joining the entire work of the section with that of Section II. He was engaged on this reconnaissance until tl1e 7th of August. Triangulation qf Hudson river, N. Y.-Assistant Edmund Blunt took the field early in July in the vicinity of New Baltimore, and conducted the triangulation of the Hudson from thence upwards to Troy, measuring throughout, as has been done on the lower part of the river, a main and secondary series of triangles. He also determined all the points required for plane-table use. The complete triangulation of the Hudson reached the vicinity of Troy in the latter part of October. Sketch No. 6 shows the range and general character of the triangulation. Lieut. W. G. Gill, U. S. A., assisted Mr. Blunt in the field-work.

Lieut. Gill is about to proceed with a party' for separate duty on the eastern coast of Florida. Topography ef Hu.Mon river, N. Y.-The detailed survey of the Hudson lms been advanced northward along its eastern side to the vicinity of Tarrytown, and the survey of the western shore completed upwards to Piermont. This work was resumed in the middle of July by Sub-Assistant John- Meehan, and joins near Hastings (Sketch No. 6) with the limits of his survey of last year. Ou the ·west bank the topography was taken up below Rockland. Both of these villages, as also Dobb' s Ferry, Irvington, and Piermont, nre included in the details of the survey made this season. The plane-table sheet embraces all the surface feat·.;.res comprised between the eastern bank of the river and the public road, which follows its course at the distance of about half a mile.

Mr. F. R. Hassler aided in the field-work of this party. Sub-Assistant Meehan is now preparing to return to Section IV. SupPlementary topog1·aphy on Lorig Island, N. Y.-Portions of detail in two localities on Long Island were filled in by Sub-Assistant F. W. Dorr during the month of August. The additions made join with his map of Williamsburg and Green Point, and are designed :to give symmetry to the engraved chart of New York harbor. These extend the topography along the New York and Jamaica turnpike, as far towards the interior of Long Island as the completed work north and south had been carried. The sheet worked on this season takes iu part of tho Flushing railroad and the Brooklyn reservoir. Supplementary work was also filled in east of Rockaway, to include Hicks's Neck and the entranec called Hog Island inlet. The tract surveyed there is mostly marsh, and suhject to changes along the shore, especially in the vicinity of the inlet named.

Sub-Assistant Dorr is about to proceed to Section VI to continue plane-table duty. Soon after the opening of the present surveying year, Mr. Rockwell inked and sent to tho archives his plane-tahle sheet of the cast side of Harlem river, being part of the result of last year's work in the vicinity of New York. A sheet containing the topography of part of Brooklyn, the city of Williamsburg, and Green Point, has also been turned in by Sub-Assistant Dorr. Hydrography qf tlte Hudson river, N. Y.-The regular hydrography of the North river was taken up at Poughkeepsie on the 28th of July, and has been extended northward to Rhinebeck and Rondout, (Sketch No. 6.) The sheet containing the soundings represents about fifteen miles of the channel of the river. This work was done by the party of Lieut. Comg. 0. M. Fauntleroy, U. S. N., Ase.istant Coast Survey, with the schooner Varina. The hydrography was discontinued for the season on the 17th of September, when arrangements were commenced preparatory to the return of the party to Section V. Of the Hudson rive.r work the following are the general statistics of the season in sounding: Miles run · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 308 Angles determined· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 2, 737 N um her of soundings· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 14, 827

Lieut. Comg. Fauntleroy has turned in all the journals and records connected with tho bydrography. Hydrographic examination o/ Fcilse Hook and Cholera bank, New York bay.-On the return of the steamer Bibb to New York for repairs, after special duty in August last, the executive officer of that vessel, Mr. Robert Platt, proceeded, under special instructions, to make an examination of the vicinity of False Hook. The schooner Joseph Henry was used in this service, and the result has been returned by Mr. Platt in the form of a chart, accompanied by records of the soundings taken. An examination of the chart seems to confirm the conclusion which was presented in a special paper on the subject of changes at Sandy Hook, in Appendix No. 27 of my annual report for 1858. The chart returned by Mr. Platt contains the following statistics: Miles run in sounding · . . . . · · · ..· · ..·. · .....·...... · · ..· · ..... · ...· 50 541 Angles determined . · · .... · · ... · · · · · · · · · ... · ..... · · · ... · · .. · · · · ... Casts of the lead .......... · .......... · · ........· · .·.............. 3,650 Cholera bank, which lies about fifteen miles eastward of the light-boat off Sandy Hook, was sounded by Mr. Platt, and the result sent to the office. Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson in December last deposited in the office two sheets, showing the results of examinations made on the Battery shoal and on Diamond reef, (New York harbor,) with journals of the soundings. Before leaving that port for duty at the south he also determined and sent to the office a sketch showing the position of the Black spar buoy, No. 5, which now marks the northeast point of the shoal off Sandy Book, and its former position to the westward and northward in thirty-six feet water. TLe depth at the present position of the buoy is twenty-nine feet. While making these determinations, Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson was accompanied by the master of the light-house tender Narragansett. Magnetic observations.-The magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were determined in August and September by Assistant. Charles A. Schott at the following stations on the southern coast of Long Island and sea-coast of New Jersey, viz: Sag Harbor, L. I.; Mount Prospect, (Brooklyn,) west base; (Fire island;) Barnegat light-houF-e, N. J.; Long beach, (Little Egg Harbor;) and Absecom light-house, (Atlantic city, N. J.) The iustruments used and method of determining the elements have been described under the head of Section I, several stations in New England having been occupied by Mr. Schott, in addition to those here mentioned. Ile was assisted in the observations by Assistant A. S. Wadsworth. The results found at all the stations are given in .Appendix No. 29. In dttermining the dip at the stations in Section II, needles :So. 1 and No. 2 were both used. Tidal ob.servations.-The self-registering tide-gauge at Governor's island, in New York harbor, which is one of the permanent tidal stations, has been kept in operation by Mr. R. T. Basset. Interruptions in the series during the winter were met by observing with an ordinary box-gauge at the Atlantic ferry dock in Brooklyn. The records of the year have been maintained with great .regularity. The series of observations made at that station is now highly valuable, though occasionally interrupted by accidents which could not be foreseen.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

A short summary is here given of the operations in field and office, which will follow it in detail. 1. An examination of station-marks set for recognizing the points determined in the main triangulation of Chesapeake bay. Such of the marks as required att.ention were replaced. 2. The extension, a short distance above Nottingham, of the triangulation of the Patuxent rivt:r, Md. 3. Further progress in the triangulation of the Potomac river. The work now reaches from the entrance of the river to Britton's bay. 4. A topographical survey from the coast of Maryland and Virginia across to the head of Pocomoke 1:1ound, embracing the tract lying in the immediate vicinity of the boundary line between the two States. 5. Supplementary details of topography at tho mouth of Elk river, Md., and plane-table work on the Patuxent and St. Mary's rivers. 6. The topography of the shores of North river completed, and that of the shores of Ware river nearly so. These are tributaries of ~fobjack bay. 7. Hydrography of the Potomac river from its entrance upward to and including St. Clement's bay. 8. The series of tidal observations at the Washington navy yard, D. C., and at Old Point Comfort, have been continued with self-registering gauges. In addition to the work of routine in.this section, views of the vicinity of Cape Henry have been drawn, to accompany charts of the Chesapeake entrance. Otfice-work.-Progress has been made in the drawing and engraving of coast map and chart No. 29, from Isle of Wight, Del., to Little Machipongo inlet, Va., and on Nos. 31, 33, 35, and 36, Chesapeake bay; in the engraving of No. 32, Chesapeake bay, from Magothy river to Hudson river, Md.; on the chart of the Rappahannock river; and in the drawing of chart No. 30, from Little Machipongo to Great Machipongo inlet; on that of the eatrance to James river, and on general coast chart No. IV, from Cape May to Currituck sound. The drawings of the upper and lower, and the engraving of the lower sheet of a preliminary chart of the Patuxent river, have been completed, as also the drawing of the chart of St. Mary's river, Md., and the engraving of the preliminary chart of that river, has been continued. The plate of the map of York river, Va., has been completed, and additions made to the progress sketch. Examination ef stations.-At intervals in July and Augu.:;t, and while his party was employed in this section in plane-table work, Assistant G. D. Wise visited the primary and secondary stations in the lower part of Chesapeake bay. Most of them on that part of the bay shores were found secure, and at any that seemed to require further protection additional marks were placed. The primary point at Cape Charles had been destroyed, but some of the secondary stations near Cape Henry were found undisturbed. Mr. Wise visited all the principal stations excepting ''Rosemary," the party being unable to land in its vicinity in consequence of a storm that p1·evailed during the visit. A. note-book containing the results of his examination, with remarks appended to refer to each station, and sketches showing their positions and the manner of marking, has been furnished to the office by Mr. Wise. Triangulation of the Patuxent river, Md.-A reach of the river extending about three miles above Nottingham, and which had not been included in the preliminary survey of the Patuxent, has been connected with that work by triangulation. This duty was executed by Assistant John Farley in April and May. Suh-Assistant S. A. Wainwright was attached to his party, and under the direction of Mr. Farley ran the shore-line of the river to the upper limit of the triangulation. The work of Mr. Wainwright joins at Nottingham with the preliminary survey made by assistant Adams. The supplemeutary triangulation is shown on Sketch No. 8. Assistant. Farley used the six-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 76.

Just below tho i:::l,md a chain of triangles was made to diverge from the main series, so as to inctude Britton' s bay to it;; head at Leonardtown, on the Maryland side of the Potomac. On the south side of the river the triangulation was extended to Nomini cliff8, (Sketch No. 8.) Tho field-work was carried on until tho 24th of December, and again prosecuted from the 24th of April until the 17th of June, a sl10rt interval of the latter period being employed in the supplementary work on the Patuxcnt. Sub-Assistant ·wainwright assisted l\fr. Farley in the early part of the season. o:a1d subsequently made a shore-line survey of the lower side of the Potomac, oppositP to Piney Point.

Topography ef the Patuxent river, Md.-The shore-line survey of the main body of this river has been completed by Assistant Adams, and the sheet returned will furnish the material required for the finished map. Resuming work early in May at Town Point, a little above Benedict, (Sketch No. 8,) .Mr. Adams executed the details in topography embraced on both shores of the Patuxent as far down as the mouth of 8t. Leonard's creek, or nearly fifteen miles below Benedict. llis plane-table sheet includes also the mouths of Indian creek, Trent Hall, Ww.hington, Coles's, and Battle creek, and the mouths of other streams which enter in the .same rcc.<>l-t of the Patuxent. The plane-t;:,,ble party returned to Baltimore early in June with the schooner Guthrie, and then took up supple~ntary work in the upper part of this section, as already referred to.

Wainwright, while attac~d to the triangulation party of Assistant Farley, extended the shore-line survey of the Patuxent ab.,,,1t three miles above Nottingham, the previous limit of the preliminary work. This supplement«~y survey was made in May. Topography of the Potomac river, ...tid.-On the Marylanoi side of the Potomac, above and below the entrance to the St. Mary's river, plane-table work has l)een extended so as to complete the survey of the north shore of the Potomac, between Point 1.ookout, on Chesapeake bay, and Piney Point. This topography is supplementary to that of St. 1'lary's river, and was executed by Assistant Adams, between tbe"2d of November and the 26th of ~cember, with a party in the schooner Guthrie. Some few subsidiary points being necessary for "'l.rryii:Jg the work to the head of the St. Mary's, Sub-Assistant Charles Ferguson was detailed to ex\P,nd the triangulation to the desired limit, and furnish points for plane-table use. The topographical work done by Assistant A.dams this season on the Potomac comprises that part of its north shore which lies between Cornfield harbor and Kit's Point, (see Sketch No. 8,) and includes the banks of Potter's creek, Jones's creek, and Smith's creek and its branches. The last named is a considerable dependency of the Potomac, and is stated as being a very convenient harbor for vesseJs in rough weather. Proceeding upwards, Mr. Adams added details at several points, and completed the map of St. Mary's river. The chart of that arm of the Potomac, in a preliminary form, accompanied my last annual report. Above the mouth of the St. Mary's, both shores of St. George's creek were surveyed to the distance of two miles, the .south shore being formed by the northern side of St. George's island. From the upper limit of work in that vicinity the shore of the Potomac, including the "Narrows," was traced as far as Piney Point light-house. By reason of the severity of the season the plane-table work was discontinued at the date before mentioned, and the party returned with the vessel to Baltimore.

The sheet containing this supplementary work is now at the office. In the early part of summer Sub-Assistant Wainwright traced forty-one miles of shore· line on the south side of the Potomac, below Sandy Point. This work includes the entrances of the Coan and Y eocomic,o rivers. The two parties have now resumed work in continuation of that just stated; :M:r. Adams and Mr. Wainwright executing tho detailed survey on opposi' e shores of the Potomac, and using the same vessel. Topography ef the North aud Ware rivers, Va.-The plane-table work outstanding on the western side of Chesapeake bay was resumed on the 26th of June by a party under charge of Assistant G. D. Wise, who was aided in the field by Mr. Oscar Hinrichs.. The details executed fall within the limits of a sheet which had been projected by Assistant John Seib a short time previous to his death, in Decern her, 1858. Assistant Wise continued personally in charge of the party until near the end of July, but was then compelled to return to Baltimore in consequence of illness. The work after that period was conducted by Mr. Hinrichs, who was also attacked with fever, but remained in the field until the 22d of September, at which date the schooner Howell Cobb returned with the party to Baltimore. Sketch No. 8.shows, in a general way, the progress made in the survey of the two hranches of }fobjack bay, named in the head of this notice. Along the shores of ·ware river the topo· graphy was extended about three miles, both being included on the plane-table sheet. The survey of the banks of the North river was completed to a point about six miles above its entrance into Chesapeake bay.

Hinrichs has been reassigned to duty in the party of A.ssistaut Bolles in Section V. Hydrogmphy of the Potomae river.-The regular hydrography of the Potomac was commenced in the middle of July last, the St. Mary's river and part only of the bed of the main river in its immediate vicinity having been sounded out last year. Commander W. T. Muse, U.S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, with a party in the steamer Hetzel, took up the work on the lower side of the Potomac, at its junction with Chesapeake bay, and sounded along the southern shore, so as to connect with his survey of last season, and then extended the general hydrography of the river upwards to a 8tation above St. Clement's bay. That branch of the Potomac, as also the one below it, known as Britton's bay, both making in from the Maryland sid~ of the river, were sounded out. On the Virginia side the sheet includes the arms called the Coan and Yeocomico rivers, (Sketch No. 8.) The hydrography of the Potomac has thus far kept pace with the triangulatiou, and both of these operations are yet in advance of the detailed topography.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Magnetic observati011s.-Preparatory to taking up a series of observations at several points in Sections 1 and II, notices of which have been made under their respective heads, Assistant Charles A. Schott determined, at the Coast Survey office, the constants of the instruments to be used in his observations. He also made observations there for the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity, by methods and with instruments which have been described under Section I. Appendix No. 29 contains the results found at all the stations. Tidal observati011s.-During the present year the self-registering tide-gauge at the Washington navy yard, D. C., has given excellent results under the care of Mr. J. "'IV. Donn, aid ··in the Tidal Division of the Coast Survey office. As heretofore, every facility for keeping the instrument in steady operation has been afforded by Commander Dahlgren and the other officers in charge of the ordnance department of the yard. Observations have been continued at Old Point Comfort, Va., with the self-registering gauge, under the charge of Mr. M. C. King. This series extends through a period of sixteen years, but the continuity has at times been broken by accidents. Of late years the observations have been kept with greater regularity.
SECTION IV.
FROM CAPE HENRY TO CAPE FEAR, INCLUDING THE COAST OF PART OF VIRGINIA AND OF PART OF NORTH CAROLINA.-(SKETcH D, No. IO.)

Two parties have been engaged in this section, and tLe results of their work were somewhat affected by the hurricane of the 29th of April, which was of extraordinary violence. The changes of this coast from the encroachment of the ocean I have several times called attention to, and am always impressed with the dangerous progress which the ocean is making whenever I take up the records of our parties on its outer coast. The following operations have been in progress in field and office: 1. The triangulation of the southwestern part of Pamplico sound, N. C. 2. A plane-table survey of the beach forming the Atlantic coast and eastern shore of Pamplico sound, between O~pe Hatteras and a station near Ocracoke inlet, N. C., and supplementary work at Oregon inlet. 3. A hydrographic reconnaissance in the upper waters of Currituck sound, ranging from Coanjock bay to Weir Point, on the North river, N. C. 4. A line of soundings run from Cape Henry to Cape Lookout, traversing the general offshore hydrography. A. view has been drawn of the vicinity of Cape Hatteras for the off-shore chart No. _V. O.ffice-worlc.-The engraving of coast maps and charts Nos. 40 and 41, Albemarle sound, has been brought up with the field-work; additions have been made on the progress sketch of the wotion, and miscellaneous work done in retouching and correcting ptites. Progress has been ma.de in the drawing of general coast chart No. VI, from Ocracoke inlet to Charleston; on coast m;i.p and chart No. 37, from Cape Henry to Currituck sound; on Nos. 46 and 47, from Cape Lookout kl Barren inlet, N. C., and on preliminary sea-coast charts Nos. 11 and 12, from Cape Battera1:1 to Cape Fear. Triangulation qf Pampl,ioo sound, N. 0.-.As stated in my la.st report, the preliminaries for this work were arranged and executed last season by Captain T. J. Oram, U.S. Topographical Engineers, Assistant in the Coast Survey. His party, in the schooner Guthrie, was again at its working ground on the 25th of October, 1859. .Assistant A. S. Wadsworth accompanied the party, and, under the direction of Captain Cram, made most of the angular measurements. The portion of the triangulation completed lies at the southwestern end of the sound. Six stations were occupied in that quarter,.and one at the northeastern end, connecting directly with the Bodies' island base. The angles were measured with the C. S. theod.:>lite No. 18. Sketch No. 10 shows the triangles so far completed by the <>bserva.tiona.

The intention of occupying three stations in addition to the number just mentioned was frustrated by the very violent storm which raged in Pamplico sound on the 29th of April. Its force was such as to destroy the high tripod signals at Cedar i&land and Pea island, the heavy timbers of which they were made being broken so as not to admit of repairs. At Cedar island tbe water, raised by the action of the wind, swept directly across the site of the signal and undermined it. The signal at Roanoke marshes was also overturned, but re-erected afterwards from the same material. The station points, being marked well be1ow the surface of the ground, were not lost by the overflow of water in the storm alluded to. It is stated by Capt. Cram, as the result of general inquiry, that no gale in Pamplico sound since that of August, 1839, has equalled it in fury. The damage done to the signals, involving the lahor of renewing several of them, will delay the completion of the main triangulation, which Capt. Cram had estimated as being quite practicable by the end of next season. In the course of the present year eight signals of the first order were erected. The progre.ss made in the details of the triangulation is shown by the following abstract: Primary stations occupied · . · . · ... · . · · . · · · . · · · · · · · ..... · .. · · · · .. ·. · 7 Signals observed on . · . · . · .....·. · . · . · ..... · . · . · · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 Angles measured ..·.... · ..... · . · . · · · ... · · · . · . · . · ........ · . . . . . . . . 33 Number of observations·············· · · · · · · · · · · · · . ·. · ·. · ... ·. ·. ·. · 4,708 Area, in square miles · · · · · ... · . · . · . · · · . · . . · · · · · · · . · · . · · · .. · · ..... · 385 The field-work was discontinued on the 15th of May. Capt. Cram has provided materials for erecting the signals necessary for a secondary triangulation within the limits of the primary work. The reconnaissance for subsidiary stations, to include points on the shores of the sound for the plane-table survey, has been in progress, and the execution of the details will, if found practicable, be pushed forward with the main triangulation. The original record of horizontal angles measured this season has been duplicated and placed in the archives of the office. Coast topography north and south <:!f Gape Haiieras, N. C.-'l'owards the end of the working season at the south, and after concluding more extended duty in this section, Sub-Assistant John Meehan completed the survey of a gap left in the topography below Bodies' island. The interval referred to was about four miles in length, and occurred at the junction of sheets left unfinished by the death of Assistant J. J. S. Hassler. The sheets wern projected so as to connect, when finished, at Oregon inlet. On the 19th of January Mr. Meehan took up tho detailed survey of the coast of North Carolina at Cape Hatteras, (see Sketch No. l(\) and pushed it southward and westward to within seven miles of Ocracoke light-house, closing for the season on the 4th of May at ''Great Swash." The stretch of main coast embraced is rather more than twenty-one miles. On the peninsula beach., which ranges from the cape southward to Hatteras inlet, and separates the ocean from Pamplico sound, the topography proved to be quite intricate. "From Durant's Point to wit.bin a mile or so of the inlet the beach averages a mile and a, half iu width and is thickly wooded, intersected by man'!hes, creeks, and ponds, and studded with small, arable patches and vegetable gardens. The ground above Durant's Point, for a dio;tance of about two miles, is low in profile and only half a mile wide. The winds have divested it of both trees and sand dunes, and it is thuR rendered liable to inundation as well from the ocean as from the water of Pamplico sound." The beach on the side towards Pamplico sound is thickly settled, the houses being mostly the dwellings of pilots. Below Hatteras inlet, Sub-Assistant Meehan surveyed the greater part of the insular beach, which runs towards Ocracoke, forming the outer coast line of North

Mr. F. R. Hassler aided in the field-work of this party. The following statistics, taken from the report of Mr. Meehan, include the supplementary topography executed at Oregon inlet: Shore-line surveyed · · · · · ·. · .... · ... · · · . · . ·· · · · . · · · . ·. · · · · · · · · 69 miles.

Since 1853 a breadth of about three-quarters of a mile of the beach at Cape Hatteras, abreast of the light-house, has been washed away. The district, however, between the cape and the settlement bolo>\' it, called 'Trent, i preseuts very considerable resistance to the waters. The average width of the peninsula there is two miles, and it is densely wooded with different kinds of oak, pine, maple, bay, beech, and dwarf palmetto. In contour the ground is comparatively bold, and although the soil is mostly of sand, except where the numerously interspersed sedge swamps occur, it is yet remarkably compact. "The small inlet which fay open immediately below Hatteras inlet in 1857 has lately closed up, but the main inlet remains almost unchanged." Special service executed by the party in charge of Sub-Assistant Meehan, in the upper part of this section, will be noticed under the- head of hydrography. All the plane-table sheets brought from the field have been inked and registered in the Coast Survey office. Ojf-8hore soundings.-On the return passage of the steamer Bibb from service at the south, Lieut. Comg. Alexander Murray, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, carried soundings coastwise and in deep water on a continuous line from the parallel of Cape Lookout to a position near Cape Henry. These soundings will serve as a verification in part of the general off-shore hydrography of the upper part of the section. The direction of the line run is marked on Sketch No. 10. _ One thousand and forty casts were made with the lead in a run of about four hundred miles. The steamer Bibb reached New York on the 11th of June, and was there refitted for other service. Notice will be taken of the previous work of this party, in describing the operations of the year, in the next two sections. One of the lines run by the Bibb, in returning from Florida, was extended to the vicinity of Cape Lookout, as will be seen by the Progres;i Sketch No. 10. Before resuming duty in the present year Lieut. Comg. Murray sent to the office eighteen volumes comprising the hydrographic records of the work done by his party between Bogue inlet and New River inlet, in the surveying season of 1858-' 59. These were accompanied, as customary, by a smooth journal of all the notes. HydrograpMc reconnaissance.-In the upper waters of Currituck sound, N. C., the party of Sub-Assistant Meehan sounded out the space designated as Coanjock bay, and also several miles of the conr.se of North river, which extends from the head of the sound across the boundary between Virginia and North Carolina, and forms the upper part of the water com· munication between Chesapeake bay and .Albemarle sound. A channel of about fourteen miles in length is represented by the sheet containing the soundings. The reconnaisliJance was carried up the North river to the month of Blackwater creek.

He also determined and laid down in position on the plane-table sheet the shoal and islet known

This duty was performed by the plane-table party in December, before taking up the regular operations in this section, as already explained. Mr. F. R. Hassler was attached to the party and aided in the work by determining the stations selected for boat soundings with the theodolite. - The following is a synopsis from the record kept by Sub-Assistant Meehan : ~liles run in sounding · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . . . .34 Sextant angles taken · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·. 151 Theodolite angles from shore-stations···· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·.... . 117 Number of casts with the lead-···································. 3,441 The level of the water of the sound was recorded daily during the month spent in this work.

FROM CAPE FEAR TO ST. MARY'S RIVER, INCLUDING PART OF THE COAST OF NORTH CAROLINA, AND THE COAST OF SOUTH CAROJ,IN A ND GEORGIA.-cSKErcH E, No. 13.)

The survey has been in full activity in this section from three centres-one at the north, on the coast of North Carolina; one in the middle, on the coast of South Carolina; and one at the south, on the coast of Georgia. In another season it will present a continuous triangulation from Winyah bay to the E:t. John's river. A. new channel :into Sapelo sound has been developed, and some changes found at Ossabaw since the survey of the Topographical Engineers in 1846. Both off and in shore hydrography have made excellent progress in the section. The work will be described under the following heads: I. Primary and secondary triangulation and topography of the coast of North Carolina, we;;t of Shallotte inlet, completing the land operations between Cape Fear and the State boundary at Little river. 2. An extension of the primary triangulation of the coast of South Carolina to Port Royal sound, and its connection with the Edisto base, and with the triangulation of St. Helena sound. 3. The triangulation of the Morgan, Coosaw, and Beaufort rivers, which connect the waters of St. Helena and Port Royal sounds. 4. Triangulation of tho coast of Georgia, from Altamaha l3ound southward and westward. This work crosses St. Simon's entrance, and includes Jekyl and St. Andrew's sound, and a part of Cumberland island. 5. The filling in of details of the plane-table survey between Port Royal sound and Savannah river. The topography includes Hilton Head island and the shores of Calibogue sound and its branches. 6. Progress in the plane-table survey of Wassaw sound, and extension of the topography of Ossabaw island. The work on Ossabaw island forms part of the material of the survey of St. Catharine's sound.

7. Off-shore hydrography between Charleston harbor and Fernandina; a partial survey of Maffitt's channel, and a complete hydrographic survey of Morgan, Coosaw, and upper part of Beaufort river, S. C. The off-shore work is supplementary to the system of lines run last year. 8. A complete hydrographic survey of Ossabaw sound, including the bar and approaches, and the principal tributaries of the sound. 9. The hydrography of Altamaha sound, Ga., in connection with in-shore soundings abreast of St. Simon's isla.nd. The work was extended upwards to Mud river, and includes a.lso Rampton river. 1.0.

1mund, Ga., have been drawn and engraved, and additions made to the chart of Charleston harbor, and to the progress sketch of the section. The drawing of the chart of St. Simon's sound, Brunswick harbor, and Turtle river, has been completed and its engraving commenced. Progress has been made in the drawing of general coast chart No. VII, from \Vinyah bay to St. John's river; on that of coast map and chart No. 48, from Barren inlet, N. C., to Lockwood's Folly inlet, N. C.; on Nos. 53 and 54, from Rattlesnake shoals to Fripp's inlet, S. C., and on the chart of Ossabaw sound; and the engraving of preliminary sea-coast chart No. 14, from Cape Romain to Savannah, has been continued. , Coast triangulation and topography between Shallotte inlet and Little river, N. 0.-The party of .Assistant C. P. Bolles took the field on the 14th of December, and completed the details of the main and secondary triangulation from Shallotte inlet westward and southward to Little river. The plane-table work was resumed at the same time by l\:lr. 0. Hinrichs, the aid in the party, and was extended from Tubb' s inlet westward to the limit of the triangulati_on. The additional ti-iang]es are laid down on Sketch No. 13. .A.breast of Tubb' s inlet the stations corresponding to the northern angles of the main series of triangles are in the immediate vicinity of the road which leads from ·wilmington, N. C., to Georgetown, S. C. In measuring tho angles Mr. Bolles used the six-inch Brunner theodolite, C. S. No. 67. This work completes the land operntions of the survey of the coast of North Carolina between Cape Fear and the southern boundary. At every step it has been carried on only by determined effort, the sides of all or most of the principal triangles requiring to be opened and cleared of the obstacles which otherwise would interpose in the lines of sight. An aggregate length of eleven miles and a half was prepared in tllis way for observing during tho present year.

Primary triangulation southward from the Ed-isf-0 base, S. C.-The scheme for extending the main triangulation of the coast of South Carolina below the primary base on Edisto island, aud for connecting that work with the secondary triangulation of the lower piirt of St. Helena som1d, having been fully matured, and its execution provided for by the preparation of lines and the erection of signals last season, Assistant C. 0. Boutelle commenced the measurement of hori· zontal angles in the early part of January. Six primary stations ·were occupied in succession, viz: West base, (Edisto island;) Aiken; .A.shepoo; Coffin; Baptist church, (Beaufort, S. C.;) and Port Royal. The position last mentioned is on the east bank of Beaufort river, and near its entrance into Port Royal sound. The entire series is shown on Sketch No. 13. The instrument used in determining the primary angles was the ten-inch theodolite, C. S. No. 43. In order to clear the lines of sight from intervening objects, tripods with high scaffolds were required at all the stations. Excepting that in Beaufort, in which instance the tower of the Baptist church furnished the desired elevation, the structures were forty-five feet in height, and were erected by the party. The device of setting screens so as to protect the theodolite scaffold from the effect of prevailing winds was a.gain employed by Mr. Boutelle, their use in the primary ·work on the coast of Maine, as mentioned in my last annual report, having fully proved their utility. · It will be seen by reference to the progress sketch (No. 13) that the primary triangulation is

now complete between Charleston harbor and Port Royal sound. To the southward of its present limit some of the stations have been selected for extending the work to the Savannah river. At the line "Morgan--Otter island" the primary series was connected \vi th the secondary triangulation which covers St. Helena sound. The extension of the secondary and tertiary work within the limits of the main triangulation will be referred to under the next head. '1.'he smaller chain which passes down the coast of South Carolina, and is now continuous from Bull's bay to Tybee entrance, was also connected with the principal series of triangles by the line '' Coffin--Otter island,'' as may be seen by the progress sketch. The schooner Petrel was used by the party of Mr. Boutelle in tl1is section. Notwithstai;iding the disadvantage under which the main triangulation was carried on south of the Edisto base, arising from the great elevation of the platforms found fo be nece~1mTy in observing with the theodolite, the greatest error in a single angle, as given by the measures, is only twenty-eight hundredths of a second. The primary work was closed for the season at Port Royal station on the 24th of A.priL .A. duplicate of the record of horizontal angles measured in the 'vork connecting with the Edisto base has been received from Mr. Boutelle. Tria11gul,ation ef tlie Morgan, Coosaw, and Beaufort rivers, S. C.-These rivers connect the waters of St. Helena and Port Royal sounds, and are partly within the limits noticed under the preceding head. After completing the triangulation of the upper part of St. Helena sound, .Assistant Boutelle projected and measured the angles of a series of triangles, induding the Coosaw river, as high up as Port Royal Ferry, (Sketch No. 13,) and, from an intermediate point in the chain, com· pleted the triangulation of Beaufort river by pushing that work southward to the city of Beaufort, where it meets the completed work of the lower part of the river. The triangulations which pass separately up these waters unite at the Brickyard, on the Coosaw. "This work was rendered exceedingly difficult by the high, dense wood which lies just north of Beaufort. 'l'he trees formed a c:implete barrier to vision from the primary station in Beaufort, although it is seventy feet above the level of the city. Other points of wood presented obstacles at every turn of the river, and cutting was required on all the lines but two. .At Pigeon Point a flag 011 a tall pine was found the best expedient, and another sign'll of the same kind was used on approaching the Coosaw, in order to aYoid e;~tensive cutting in joining the triangulation of the two rivers." The Morgan river and Parrutt creek were included by Mr. Boutelle in the triangulation going southward from St. Helena sound . .At the river stations the angles were measured with the ten-inch theodolite, C. S. No. 43, ~nd the eight-inch instrument, C. S. No. 24. The mpde of observing was that usually employed 1 n the triangulation of this section. Each set of six repetitions with the theodolite is a mean of three direct and three observations with the instrument reversed. Messrs. C. H. Boyd and C. B. Boutelle were attached as aids to the triangulation party. The schooner Petrel, which had been in use for transportation, was laid up at Charleston on the 3d of May. Frequent aHusion has been made in previous notices of work in this section to the develop· ment of the Inland passage, as it is called, which ranges along the coast of South Carolina and Georgia, behind the sea islands. Another link of this important line of communication has be.en developed this season by the joint labors of the field and hydrograpbic parties on duty in th1s vicinity. In the course of his triangulation .Assistant Boutelle furnished the points neces· aary for sounding out the Coosaw and Morgan rivers, and the upper part of Beaufort river, f~om its junction with the Coosaw to the city of Beaufort. The following is an extract from his prelirnb)ary report made in March last : "That part of Coosaw river lying above Coosaw

sc

island, and between the island and the junction of Beaufort river with Coosaw river, has been supposed too shallow for the steamers that formerly passed between Charleston and Savannah, and they have often grounded there at very low tides." ''In beating down the river last week I found a continuous channel which will probably give fifteen feet at mean low water over the whole bed of rocks which forms the bottom of the river, where six and seven feet was supposed to be the best water.'' The passage referred to is taken by steamers running south of Charleston by the inland route. Its development will be more particularly referred to, under the head of hydrography1 before closing this chapter. The field operations were stopped for the season at the end of April. Mr. Boutelle reported in person at the Coast Suryey office on his way northward, and then took up duty in Section II. The following is a summary of statistics of the primary and secondary triangulation executed between the rivers connected with St. Helena and Port Royal sounds: Stations occupied · · · · · · · · · .Angles measured. · · · · · · · · · Signals observed on· · · · · · · · Number of observations· · · · · · ·· · ····· · ··· · · ···· · ·· ·· ·· ·· ·· ··· · · ·· · 31 ·· ···· · ·· · · ·· · ··· · ·· · · ··. · · ·· · · · ··· · ·· · 401 · · ·· · ···· ···· · · ···. ···· · ·· ··· ···· · ·· ·· . 358 · · · · · · · · · · . · ...................... · · . . . 6, 980

Triangulation ef Jekyl and St. .Andrew's sounds, Ga.-Sub-Assistant F. P. Webber, with a _party in the schooner Hassler, took up work near Darien on the 5th of December, and completed the secondary triangulation marked on Sketch No. 13, which includes the Inland passage between Altamaha and St. Simon's sounds. At Turtle River entrance his work connects with two of the triangles measured by .Assistant Longfellow in the survey of St. Simon's sound, and from thence the coast series was extended southward and westward quite across Jokyl and St. Andrew's sounds, including also the Great and Little Satilla rivers, and through the Inland passage, behind Cumberland island, to a station within twelve miles of the mouth of St. Mary's river. On comparing, by computation, the length of the side ''Brunswick Point--Cedar Ilammock," (See Sketch No. 13,) which connects with the Sapelo preliminary base through twenty-six triangles, and also with the preliminary base at St. Simon's sound, the difference in length, as derived from the independent measurements, was nine-tenths of a metre. Mr. Webber used the ten-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 63, and the six·inch Brunner, C. 8. No. 52, and iu the course of his triangulation determined the exact positions of seventyfour points. The statistics of the work are appended in the usual form:

The vessel used reached New York, on her return from duty in this section, on the 12th of April, and was afterwards employed in Section I. Sub-Assistant Webber thus refers to the impediments met in pushing the triangulation southward, between St. Simon's island and the main land of Geogia: "The Inland passage, through which it was necessary to carry the triangulation, is about three miles wide, and a branch of the fresh water of the Altamaba rive1· has caused the grass to grow to the height of twelve to fifteen feet. The hard land being on a level with the marsh, I was obliged to build four tripod signals with scaffolds, for observing with the theodolite. One of these was twenty-five fee-t

high, and the others each sixteen feet. As the work advanced to the southward we were able· to progress faster." A duplicated record of the horizontal angles measured between Altamaha river and Cumberland island has been received from Mr. Webber, and placed in the office, with his descriptions of the stations occupied for carrying on the triangulation. Coast topography from Port Royal entrance, S. C., to Savannah river, Ga.-The details of this work, following the shore-line survey of last year, have been completed by M:r. Cleveland Rockwell, to whom the duty was assigned after the death of Assistant John Seib. Fieldservice was resumed on the 23d of January, and closed on the 22d of May. The topography is contained on two sheets, and embraces Hilton Head island, the entire shores of Calibogue sound and its branches, including also the inland passage which connects it with Port Royal sound and the shores of Cooper and May rivers, the whole of Dawfuskie, Turtle, Pine, and Bull islands, and part of Pinckney's island. At the junction of Mackay's and May river the survey takes in a small portion of the main land of South Carolina, the planetable work heretofore reported being wholly confined to the belt of sea islands which ranges along the southern coast. The limits of the topogrnphy may be seen on Sketch No. 13. Having been associated with Assistant Seib in the preliminary survey, Mr. Rockwell's knowledge of the ground enabled him to push on the work, and, with the advantage of weather favorable upon the whole for field operations, to make a large return of material. The following are the statistics: Shore-line . · .. · · . · · · · · · · · · · .. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 190 miles. 64 " Roads · · · · - · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Area, in square miles · ·. · .......... · .. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 90 Mr. Rockwell's party used the schooner Bailey for work in this section. The vessel returned to New York early in June. Arrangements were made at the outset of the surveying year for the completion of the plane-table work between Port Royal entrance and Savannah river, but the movements of the party were delayed in consequence of the sudden death of Assistant Seib, which occurred on the 23d of December, at Washington. I have elsewhere in tAis report alluded to the faithful labors of that able topographer, whose industry and patience merit a lasting remembrance in connection with the plane-table survey of this and other sections of the Atlantic coast. Topography qf Wa.ssaw and St. Catharine's sounds, Ga.-Th~ plane-table survey of Wassaw sound was begun on the 24th of March by Sub-Assistant H. S. Du Val, with a party in the schooner Meredith. .A.bout five miles of the outer shore of Little Tybee island, on the north side of the entrance, and as much of the outside of W assaw island, were traced, and the shore· line given to the hydrographic party then working in Ossabaw sound. The survey of Ossabaw island had been resumed with a view of c'ompleting the map of St. Catharine's sound within the season if practicable. Mr. Du Val, after joining his sheet with the topography of the upper part of the island, executed by .Assistant Harrison in 1858, continued the work south· ward to within four miles of the point at the entrance of St. Catharine's sound. On Ossabaw island the party worked under unusual difficulties from the opening of the year until after the middle of March. These were in part due to the continued rains in January1 hut to a greater extent arose from the nature of the surface features of the interior of the island, the marshes creeks and woods being so interspersed as to make it a matter of great . ' ' difficulty to pass from point to point with the plane-table. The two localities of work referred to in this notice are shown on Sketch No. 13. Sub-Assistant Du Val was aided in the field by Mr. J. D. Bradford. The following is a. summary of progress made by this party:

ResurVe1.J qf MaJfitt' s channel, Charleston harbor.-At the request of the harbor comrni&sioners of Charleston, made opportunely while the schooner Crawford was at that port with the party of Lieut. Comg. Bankhead, a partial examination was undertaken hy that c1fiicer in order to determine the condition of the channel surveyed by Lieut. J. N. Maffitt in 1850. The portion sounded out extends from the buoy on the end of the jet.tee to the black buoy in the channel. A tide-gauge was set up at Fort Sumter for the reduction of the soundings, but after recording a. short series of observations it was unfortunately swept away by a heavy gale, preventing the e$tablishment of a bench-mark for the references desirable iu comparing the results with those given by the former surveys of the channel. The soundings were begun on the 9th, and concluded on the 11th of May. In his report, made in advance of the plotting of his hydrograpbic sheet, Lieut. Comg. Bankhead remarks: "That the channel has narrowed since the dredge-boat was discontinued is an undoubted fact, but to what extent can, at present, be only a matter of surmise." Hydrography ef the Ooosaw, Mm·gan, and Beaufort rivers, S. 0.-These rivers, intermediate between, and connecting the WtLters of St. Helena and Port Royal sounds, were thoroughly examined and sounded out by the party of Lieut. Comg. Bankhead in May, during an interval of the working period which was employed in two other localities of this section. In the Coosaw, the hydrography was joined with that of St. Helena sound, and was extended up to the junction of Beaufort river, and down that river to the city of Beaufort. The hydrogra.phy

of the lower part of Beaufort river was executed, in connection with that of Port Royal sound, in 1855, by Lieut. Comg. Maffitt. Lieut. Comg. Bankhead sounded out the channel of Morgan river, and that of its branch, Parott's creek, which connects the Morgan with Coosaw river in passing around Morgan island. In connection with the river hydrography, the tides were observed for a full lunation for the accurate reduction of soundings. .The following are the statistics of general work: Miles run · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 463 Angles determined . · · · ·., · · · · · · · · · .. · · · · .. ·. ·. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 1,652 Casts of the lead ... · .... · · .... · ..... · ..... · .... · · . · . · · · · · · · · · · . 26, 488 .Area sounded, (square miles)···· · · · · · · · · · · · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 12 This hydrograpby was executed with the schooner Crawford. The courses of the rivers sounded are marked on Sketch No. 13. I have already adverted, under another head, to the general interests which may inure from the development of the inland passage along the southern coast. Hydrograplly ef Ossabaw sound, Ga., and its approaclies.-This hydrographic survey was commenced and completed within the present season by the party of Lieut. Comg. C. M. Fauntleroy, U. S. N., .Assistant in the Coast Survey, working with the schooner Varina and steam-tender Fire Fly. The soundings in the approaches were carried out nine miles from shore into eight; fathoms water, and extend over a space of about the same length a.breast of the entrance, including in the coastwise range of the sheet three miles of the shore of Great W assaw i8land, on the north side of the entrance, and about tvw miles and a half of the outer shore of Ossabaw island, as will be seen by referring to the progress sketch (No. 13.) A full development was made of the outer bar, and of the channel leading into the sound. In allusion to that part of his work, Lieut. Comg. Fauntleroy thus reports: "The channel is narrow, and the entrance leading into the sound is nearly six miles to the southward of it. It can be approached with confidence, as the soundings shoal gradually from eight to three and a quarter fathoms, which can be carried in until the north point of Ossabaw island bears west, where the water deepens to six and seven fathoms. Thence on, it shoals until within a mile and a half of the north point of Ossabaw, nearly abreast of the point of bare shoal, where the channel is suddenly ob-structed by a belt extending inward for nearly two miles, and over that only fourteen feet can be carried at low-water to deeper water:, and a safe anchorage inside. The anchorage is off the west point of Raccoon island, close to, in six and seven fathoms, sticky bottom." Other remarks taken from the same report relative to the character of the sound and its dependencies will be found in the .Appendix (No. 12.) Besides the bar, entrance, and body of the sound, the hydrographic operations of the party in the Varina embraced the survey of the Ogeechee river to a distance of four miles from its mouth, and the mouth of the inland passage leading from it southward; the hydrography of the Vernon river up to Montgomery, and that of the lower part ot its tributary, the Little Ogeechee, with portions also of the Romerly Marsh passage and Wassaw creek. At the Romerls marshes the work was connected with soundings made by Lieut. Comg. J. N. Maffit in 1855. .A. preliminary chart of Ossabaw sound accompanies this report, as Sketch No. J 4. Tidal observations were made from February 9th until .April 25th by the hydrographic party at Camp creek, and in the Ogeechee, opposite to the Florida passage, from the 9th until the 25th of .April. The currents were observed in the usual way at four stations while the soundings were in progress. The hydrogra.phic survey of Ossabaw sound is based on the topography executed by Assistant .A.. M. Harrison in 1858. .An extract from the report 9f Lieut. Comg. Fauntleroy shows that the effeet of the ocean on the land had become quite noticeable in the short period which has

elapsed since the completion of the plane-table survey. He says~ "The seaward face of Ossabaw island has certainly undergone considerable change of feature since that portion of the shore-line embraced in my projection was executed. The triangulation point, 'N. Osscibaw island No. 2,' has washed away since the commencement of our surv<:>y, and the spot is now marked by a large tripod erected by my party." On the morning of the 21st of February the Russian bark Vesta ran on the north breaker at Ossabaw entrance and was wrecked. Her officers and erew were received and sheltered for the night in the Varina, and by the co·operation of Lieut. Comg. Fauntleroy and his party · the cargo and stores of the vessel were ultimately saved to the owners. These services have been acknowledged in suitable terms, addretssed to the chief of the party, by the Russian vice· c;:onsul at Savannah. The particulars of the hydrographic work at Ossabaw are summed up as follows iu the report: Hydrographic signals determined· · · . · · · ...................... ·. · . 55 Theodolite angles observed······ · · · · · · · ·· · . ·. · . ·. · · · · · · · ·. · · · · · · 1,235 Sextant angles observed· · · · · · · · · · . · · ........................ · · · . 3, 14 7 Miles run in sounding · ... · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 958~ Number of soundings···.· . · · ·. · · · ... · ... · .................. ·.. . 55, 568 Area, (in square miles).· ..... ·. · ..... · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 110 Part of the shore·line traced this season by Sub-Assistant Du Val was furnished to the hydrographic party. Progress in the work during March and April was much hindered by the causeB referred to in the notice already taken of the plane-table survey in the vicinity of Ossabaw sound. The season at the north was occupied by the party in the Varina in extending the hydrography of the Hudson river in Section II. Hydrograpky ef .Altamaha sound and adjacent coast ef Georgia.-Tbis work was executed by the party of Lieut. Comg. Bankhead with the schooner Crawford, who employed the months of February, March, and April in this part of the section. The work includes the hydrography of the lower part of Aitamaha sound, and that of the coast abreast of St. Simon's island. It embraces also six miles of the channel of Hampton river. The sheet containing the soundings is yet unfinished, the seaward limit so far reached going only four miles from shore to seaward. In .Altamaha sound the hydrography was extended three miles upward from the entrance, or to the junction of Mud river, which forms a link of the inland passage, leading behind St. Simon's island. Lieut. Comg. Bankhead remarks as follows on the character of the approaches to this part of the coast of Georgia: ''The hydrography of the Altamaha was very difficult, owing to the great number of sand bars and shoals which extend immediately off the coast to the distance of three or four miles. At times, too, it was dangerous, as involving the necessity of sending the sounding boats that distance from the schooner, but, by watching the weather closely, all accidents were avoided." The following is a summary of the statistics: Miles run···· · ·. · · · · .·...................·...·.......·.·...·... 623 Angles determined. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ...·......... 2,203 Soundings · · · . · . · · · . · .... · · · .. · ............ · ···· · · · · · · · · ..·.. · .. 39,812 .Area sounded, (square miles) ......·.·.... ·. · ·.... · · · · · · · · . · ..... . 48

In reference to the sound itself, Lieut. Comg. Bankhead observes: "The Altamaha being subject at certain times to freshets, the bar can never be made available for any but vessels of light draught, as the channel is constantly shifting, a.nd at times h&S not more than five feet depth at low water."

"The shore cannot be approached with safety nearer than three and a half miles anywhere between St. Simon's and Do boy entrancr s." The work abreast of St. Simon's islan<l was discontinued on the 14th of April, the party in the Crawford th~n taking up the off-shore hydrography already mentioned in this chapter. During the latter part of summer, and until the end of the working season at the north, Lieut. Comg. Bankhead was engaged in hydrographic duty in Section I. While employed in the hydrography off St. Simon's entrance, Georgia, the schooner Crawford very narrowly escaped destruction on the morning of the 13th of June by a water spout. The spray from it fell on the deck of the vessel, but fortunately a flaw from the whirlwind at the same time shot the schooner ahead, causing her taffrail barely to clear the body of the rushing column. Ti'daJ, observati'ons.-The permanent self-registering tide-gauge at the custom-house wharf in Charleston, S. C., has worked with regularity throughout the year, though under difficulties which will req11ire some ingenuity to overcome in order to preserve the series unbroken. Experiments for this purpose are now in progress. The registers of the year have been steadily kept up by the observer, Mr. W. R. Herron. SECTION VI.
FROM ST. MARY'S RIVER TO ST. JOSEPH'S BAY, INCLUDING THE EASTERN AND PART OF THE WESTERN COAST OF FLORIDA, WITH THE REEFS AND KEYS.-(SKETcu F, Nos. 15 1J.nd 16.)

This section has advanced remarkably well during the season. The work has been going on from four centres-St. Augustine, in the north; Indian River inlet, in the middle of the eastern coast of the peninsula; the keys near the Cape Sable base, at t1ie south; and Charlotte harbor, on the western side of the peninsula. The line across the peninsula has also made good progress. One of the largest season's work of topography in the Coast Survey, by a single party, was executed at Charlotte harbor. The operations will be stated in the following order: 1. Progress in the air-line triangulation from Waldo station westward to Gainsville, Fla. 2. Triangulation north and south of St. Augustine harbor. This work connects with the coast triangulation going south of St. John's river, and extends southward, along the coast of Florida, to Matanzas inlet. 3. Triangulation completed, and plane-table survey made of Indian River inlet, Fla. A hydrographic reconnaissance was made in connection with this work. 4. A connection across the waters of Chatham bay, Fla., by triangulation, from Card's sound to the limit of the reef triangulation at Pigeon key. This completes the preliminary work on the main line of the keys between Cape Florida and 'Key West. 5. Further progress nearly completing the triangulation of Charlotte harbor, Fla. The work doue includes the upper part of the harbor. 6. A complete topographical survey of the shores of St. Augustine harbor, including the city, the coast approaches, and the shores of the San Sebastian, the Matanzas, and the North river adjacent to the harbor. 7. Progress in the plane-table survey of Charlotte harbor, nearly completing it. This survey includes the lower parts of Myakka river and Peas creek, Fla. 8. St. Augustine harbor and its approaches thoroughly sounded, and Jines run coastwise to t.raverse the off-shore hydrography of the section. In the course of this work a four-fathom bank was discovered off the coast of Florida, northeast of Indian River inlet. 9. The hydrography of the Florida reef, extended from Grassy key, northward and eastward to Lower Matacumba. Soundings continued in the same direction will complete the outside hydrography of the reef at Key Rodriguez.

10. Magnetic observations recorded by photography at Key West. These are designed to be comparable with a series obtained in Section I. 1]. Tidal observations continued at Fort Clinch and at Tortugas. This last station has been selected as a point of reference for the observations made on the reef and on the Gulf coast of the Florida peninsula. . Views of the vicinity of Key West and other keys have been drawn for the charts of the Florida reef. Office-work.-The drawing has been completed and the engraving continued of coast map and chart No. 68, from Key Biscayne to Carysfort reef, and No. 71, from Bay Pine key to Boca Grande key. A chart of St . .Augustine harbor has been drawn and progress made in its engraving, as also in the draw·ing and engraving of general coast chart No. X, from Cape Florida to Cape Sable. The drawing of coast map and chart No. 58, from St. lfary's river to St . .John's river; Nos. 69 and 70, from Garden key to Bay Pine key, (Florida reef,) and No. 74, from Lower Matccumbe key to Cape Sable, h11s been continued. The progress sketches have received additions, and diagrams have been drawn and engraved to illustrate the results of explorations in the Gulf Stream. Triangulation across the Flm·ida penin.sula.-The preliminaries for tho measurement of angles to extend this work beyond the limit already reached were resumed, in January last, near Waldo, a point on the line of the Florida railroad. These, as in several past seasons, include, in addition to the selection of suitable points and the putting up of signals, the cutting and clearing of lines constituting the sides of the triangles. The work has been continued under the general charge of Captain M. L. Smith, U. s: Topographical Engineers, Assistant in the Coast Survey, and bas advanced to the vicinity of Gainsville, in its course between Fernandina and Cedar Keys. The details of the scheme were executed by a party under the immediate direction of Lieut. R. G. Cole, U.S. A., Assistant Coast Survey. Lieut. 0. D. Greene, U.S . .A., joined the party on the 14th of February, and CO·operated efficiently in assist.ing Lieut. Cole. The expern~e and labor of opening all the lines of sight in prosecuting the work southward and westward from Fernandina suggested the expedient of throwing one side of the entire series of triangles for the remaining distance on the cleared line of the railroad to Cedar Keys. This plan was adopted at the outset of the present season. The chain of triangles prepared by Lieut. Cole, for measurement, will extend the triangulation twenty-seven miles, and is pro· jected (Sketch No. 15) so as to make the stretches of the railroad correspond, as far as prac· ticable, with the southern sides of the triangles. Field operations were continued until the 12th of .June. Lines making in the aggregate about sixty-nine miles, and forming five com· plete triangle8, were cleared, and two other triangles were partly prepared for observing with the theodolite. The length just stated is exclusive of the triangle side, running in the direction to Cedar Keys. Eight signals were commenced, and the construction of six of them completed, before the close of the season. Capt. Smith has it in view to take up, during the present autumn, and complete the measurement of angles as far as the cutting already done has prepared lines, before the main party again takes the field for opening others below Gainsville. The nature of the surface of the northern part of the Florida peninsula, in its bearing on tbe progress of the air-line triangulation, was referred to in my annual reports for 1857 and 1859. Triangulatlon north and south of St · .Augustine, Fla.-A connection has been made between the triangulation going south along the coast of Florida, from St. John's river entrance, .and that executed last year from St. Augustine harbor northward. The gap then left and now closed by the connecting triangles extends about eight miles from the source of North river. The junction between the two chains of work: was made in the line "Tam Smith - - - Sulana.," (Sketch No. 15,) which is about twenty-three mileB north of St. .Augustine.·

This work was executed by the party of Sub ·Assist11nt Benjamin Huger, jr., between the 28th of November and the 16th of April. The entire course of the North river is included in the b'iangulation. The triangulation south of St. Augustine was resumed, a scheme for its extension along the coast having been perfected by Mr. Huger in the course of the last surveying season. In following it out Sub-Assistant W. H. Dennis, who was attached to the party and in charge of it while Mr. Huger was disabled by sickness, carried forward and completed a range of triangles, including about ten miles of the coast south of the entrance to St. Augustine, and within that space the course of the Matanzas river. The operat.iom;of the party were closed on the Gth of May.

S. No. 83. Mr. Huger has forwarded to the office the record,; of the triangulation. Triangulation at Indian River inlet, Fla.-On making an examination previous to resuming work in the vicinity, Sub-Assistant Charles Ferguson found the preliminary base which had been measured in the season of 1858-' 59 by Sub-A.ssistant Sullivan, and marked by stone blocks, in good order, and the tripods and signals then erected still standing, with but one exception. This was at once reset, and the ends of the base were occupied as stations. The triangulation was taken up on the 7th of February, and continued jointly with the topography, until the 12th of March. Six secondary signals were built for plane-table work along the line of Indian river. These average hrnnty-five feet in l1eight, and are so arranged as to admit of being occupied with the theodolite. One of the signals used in the triangulation is fifty feet bigh. The positions of all of them arc marked on Sketch No. 15. ''The difiieulty in carrying on the triangulation arises from the character of the is1auds bordering on the ocean. They are covered with a dense growth of mangrove, oak, and palmetto, and the ground rises gradually from the sea-beach to the middle, whore the hills abruptly end, leaving a swamp of palmetto underbrush, decayed logs, roots, and stumps of trees, on the western side of the islands." The lines observed on by Sub-Assistant Ferguson connect the <>~ter coast with the main land of Florida abreast of Indian River inlet, and extend the triangulation north and south about seven miles to a station five miles above Fort Capron. AU the angles were measured with the six-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 65.

Fairfield connecting that leading from the Key Biscayne base, through Card's sound, (Sketch No. 16,) with the work done on the inner keys, and with the triangulation passing across Florida bay, from the general line of keys to the primary base on Cape Sable. The space included in his work is known as Chatham bay. It forms the eastern part of Barnes's sound, and lies southward and westward between Shell key and Pigeon key, being bounded on the east mainly by the inner shore of Key Largo. Sub-Assistant P. C. F. West assisted in the triangulation. The work was taken up on the 7th of March, and prosecuted until the 26th of May. The depth in the cl1annel of Tavernier creek not admitting of the passage of the schooner Caswei.l, which was used by the party, Assistant Fairfield took the vessel through a pass about five miles below Pigeon Key, and moved up along the inside of the reef as far as the draught would allow. A camp was found necessary in making the anguh1r measurements from Pigeon key, and also for occupying the station on Pie key, the point at which the triangulation connects wit.h the work done last year by Lieutenant Seward. Having gone as far as practicable :in that quarter, Mr. Fairfield took the schooner to the north side of Key Rodriguez, and transported the material for signals by a boat through Tavernier creek, opening at the same time a road across the narrow part of Key Largo. This plan greatly facilitated the future operations of the party. One of the boats being left on the inside of the key, the party thus had means for returning to the vessel, which lay at anchor outside of the reef. The statistics of the triangulation are as follows:

In his report Mr. Fairfield commends the efficiency shown by Sub-Assistant West, and also specially refers to the ready co-operation of Sailing-master Budd in the erection of signals and scaffolds required at the theodolite stations. The schooner Caswell reached Baltimore on the 13th of June, and was laid up during the summer. Assistant Fairfield has sent to the office his record of the horizontal angles measured, and descriptions of the station-marks. ·Triangulation of Charlotte harbor, Fla.-The operations conducted this season by Lieutenant W. R. Terrill, U. S. A., Assistant in the Coast Survey, very nearly complete.d the triangulation of Charlotte harbor and its dependencies, only the narrow pass between Pine island and the main land of Florida yet requiring points to be determined for the plane-table survey. Lieutenant Terrill joined with his work of last season at Boca Grande, and also at a station on the north end of Pine island, and from thence northward executed the triangulation shown on Sketch No. 15. It includes all the upper part of the harbor and a portion of Peas creek, which empties from the eastward into its northern extremity. Along the Gulf shore the stations occupied this year reach nearly nine miles above Boca. Grande, leaving in that direction only a few points necessary for t~ complete development of the ap.proaches. The stations previously used, and with which it was necessary to connect, h1witig been marked with care, were easily recognized, although the signals had gone down in the two violent gales of October 28 and November rn, 1859. Some delay was ocoosioned in rese-tting them; but the observations were taken up on ihe 22d of December, and steadily prosecuted until the 20th of March. The angles were measured with the ten-inch theodolite, Gam.bey No. 81. 'l'he topography was provided for by points furnished as the triangulation advanced. Lieutenant Terrill was assisted in the field by Li-0utenant George Boll, U. S. A., Assistant,

Lieutenant Terrell commends the zeal and efficiency of the assistants who \Vere associated with Lim in work, and also makes special mention of aid cordially rendered by Sub-Assii-;taut Iardella, who conducted the plane-table party. The schooner Bowditch was used in carrying on the triangulation. In making arrangements for continuing the survey of the western side of the Florida peninsula, such means as are available will be applied to the hydrography of Charlotte harbor, so as to prO'vide for the issue of a chart with the least delay possible. 'l'o meet in some measure now the desired end, Lieutenant Terrill has communicated sailing directions for entering it by the principal pass, Boca Grande, (see Appendix No. 31,) with remarks in reference to the capacity of the channel inside, and the character and extent of the existing shoals. Some remarks on the coast features between Charlotte harbor and Tampa bay are given in the same appendix. These furnish the results of a reconnaissance through Sarnsota bay on the return of the vesfel from Tampa with materials required in the work of Charlotte harbor. The reconnaissance was made at the outset of the season. The schooner Bowditch reached New York, on her return from the south, on the 9th of April, and is now refitting for the completion of the preliminary work in which she was previously employed. An abstract of the record of horizontal angles determined in the preliminary work at Charlotte harbor, and the usual field computation, have been furnished by Lieutenant Terrill. He has also filed at the office the original notes, and descriptions of the signals and stations. Top;graphy ef St . .Augustine liarbor, Fla.-A complete -plane-table survey of the harbor, shores, and city of St. Augustine and the adjacent coast, including also several miles of the banks along the courses of' the North and Matanzas rivers, has been made by the party of Sub.Assistant F. W. Dorr. The work is contained on two sheets, one of which represents the entrance, the city, and the northern part of' Anastatia island, portions of the Matanzas and San Sebastian rivers in the vicinity of the harbor, the entire shores of the harbor, and the lower part of North river. Its limits, as also those of the second, which extends the survey along the eastern coast of Florida, and takes in also a part of North river, are laid down on Sketch No. 15. On the Atlantic L!>hore the work was carried about sixteen miles north of the entrance to St. Augustine, and four miles southward of it. Both banks of the North river were traced to a distance of nearly e· ght miles above its mouth; and the banks of its tributary, the Guano river, seven and a half miles from its entrance into the main stream. For the most part, the wood line, or edge of the pine barren, was taken as the western boundary of the plane-table work. Th~s survey was made between the 1st of December and the 21st of }farch. Sub-Assistant Dorr was aided in the field by Messrs lfcLane Tilton, and H. W. Bache, and employed the schooner Dana for transportation.

The execution of the hydrography, which appears on the preliminary chart of th'? harbor and approaches, will be referred to 1lnder that head. The survey of St. Augm;tine was founded on the triangulation made last year by SubAssistant Huger. I have placed in the Appendix (No. 30) some extracts from the report of Sub-Assistant Dorr, having reference to the topographical features of this part of the coast of lflorida. The two plane-ta.b1e sheets of the survey of St. Augustine harbor and North river were inked by M;. Dorr immediately after his return from the section, and are now on file in the Coast Survey office. He was engaged during the summer in plane-table duty in Section IL Topography cf Indian River inlet, Fla.-Within tho limits of his own triangulation of this season, Sub-Assistant Ferguson made a plane-table survey of the eastern coast of Florida within a range of seven miles above and below Indian River inlet. Tho limits of the sheet containing it are marked on Sketch No. 15, which shows tho progress made at this and other localities in the section. The survey at the inlet includes the entrances and the adjacent shoals and mouths of the passes leading from them. Mr. Forguson also made preliminary soundings through the Fort Pierce channel, and determined in position the buoys and stakes from the entrance southward into the main river, which is about a mile and a half south of ]'ort Capron. Tha topography embraces, in addition to numerous sma1l keys, one of tho large mangrove iAlands near the main inlet, the village at Fort Capron, and the west bank of Indian river, from the village to a point two miles below it. The statistics are thus given in the field report:

In reference to the capacity of the Fort Pierce channel and characteristics of this part of the coast of Florida Mr. Ferguson observes: "This channel is the widest and has about six feet water in the deepest part at high tide It is filled with sand bars and oyster beds, which render the navigation difficult and dangerous for vessels drawing over three feet of water. The other inlets to the river are hardly navigable, even at high tide, by fishing boats, as they are mostly blocked up by shoals and sand bars. One of these was sounded out while the party was employed in the section. "Indian river is from three quarters to a mile wide. Its western shore is marshy, with occasional hummocks, and about half a mile from the sbo1 .Aine runs a ridge, covered with pine and palmetto trees. The height of this ridge was determined by the theodolite, and found to be fifty-two feet above low tide at l Ridge' signal. Its general direction is about N.NW., and nearly parallel with the water-line. ''There are two channels over the bar at Indian River inlet. The southern one opens during a series of northerly gales, and .fills up when the wind i.s in a contrary direction. Three buoys of timber, with granite blocks attached to them, were placed in this channel by the planetable party. The buoys were marked with white crosses at their tops.

There has not been, at any time during the season, more than three feet of water in either of the bar channels at low tide, and not often six feet at the highest. The ordinary rise of the tide is about two feet.'' Special care was taken by Mr. Ferguson in tracing the shoals inside of the bar. As far as practicable, they were occupied with the plane-table at low water, and when this could not be done, signals were put up anl'J. determined from other fixed points. The plane-table work was begun in February, and stopped for the season on the 20th of April; the schooner Benjamin Peirce being then laid up after her return to New York. Mr. H. Anderson, the aid of the party, on reporting at the Coast Survey office, was assigned to duty in Section X. Sub-Assistant Ferguson's plane-table sheet, mid. that containing the soundings made by his party, are now at the Coast Survey office. After its completion he took up field duty in Section I. Topography ef Charlotte harbor, Fla.-It has already been remarked that the points requisite for this plane-table survey were determined as the triangulation of the season went forward. While these preliminaries were in progress Sub-Assistant C. T. Iardella, who was assigned with a party in the schooner Agassiz for pm;l1ing on the topography, employed the time in co-operating with Assistant Fairfield in the triangulation of Chatham bay, notice of which has been taken in this chapter. Plane-table work was resumed at Charlotte harbor on the 13th of January, Mr. Iardella joining his first sheet at Boca Grande (see Sketch No. 15) with one executed last year by SubAssistant Ferguson. Ou the western or Gulf side, Gasparilla and Boca Nueva keys, with many detached and broken pa,tches peculiar to that part of tho coast of Florida, were surveyed within the range of fifteen miles between Boca Grande and Bocilla Pass, and the inner shoreline from Bocilla Pass to Aguado key. "This part of the peninsula is cut into hundreds of small keys, which are entirely covered with water at spring tides, and some of them at ordinary low water. Between the keys the water is so shallow that at times it is imp~ssible to pass a boat from key to key, without dragging it through the mud." Three other sheets, projected by Sub-Assistant Iardella, embrace all the main shore of the upper part of Charlotte harbor north of Pine island; severnl miles of the courrn of the Myakka river, one of its tributaries, and fifteen miles of the course.of Peas creek, another. Both of these streams make in at the north end of the bay. The last mentioned is stated to he navigable from its entrance to Whiting's camp, a distance of twenty miles, for vessels drawing five feet. Its banks are high and covered with pine trees of good size. The general character of the western shore of ~he 1iarbor, at its upper part, is the same as that referred to as descriptive of the opposite or Gulf coast. In outline it is very irregular and marked by innumerable little creeks and lagoons. The plane-table work followed the triangulation of Lieut. Terrill, with whom Mr. fardella co-operated as occat>ion required. On closing for the season only e. few minor details remained to complete the survey inside of the harbor. As the work is now well advanced, it is proposed to take up the hydrography this winter. The schooner Agassiz was despatched for New York on the 2d of April, and was laid up there on the 20th. Preparations are now making for her return to this section.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Hydrography qf St. Augustine 1iarbor and its app1·oaehes, Fla.-This service was performed by a party in the schooner Arago, placed temporarily in charge of Lieut. Comg. Alexander Murray, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, for that duty. Soundings were commenced on the 23d of February, and closed with the completion of the survey on the 10th of April. Two sheets liave Leen returned, one of which shows the harbor abreast of the city of St. .Augustine, with eight miles and a half of the course and channol of tho North river, and rather more than five miles of the course of the Matanzas, and also the part of its tributary, the St. Sebastian, adjacent to the city. On the second sheet, are shown the entrance to the harbor, the bar, and the coast hydrography, ranging about eight miles north and south of the entrance, and extending six miles seaward. The preliminary chart resulting from this work is given as No. 17 of the sketches which accompany this report. A. synopsis of the statistics of soundings is thus given on the original sheets: 1,273 Number of positions used · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · .. · . · · · · . 312 Miles run in sounding · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · . · · · · ..... · . · ..

On the completion of the survey, Lieut. Comg. Murray returned to Charleston, and resumed command of the steamer Bibb, transferring the Arago at the same time to the party of IJieut. Comg. W. Ronckendorff. The journals of i,:oundings and angles made in the survey of St. Augustine harbor, together with a smooth register compiled from the original nvtes, have betm received from Lieut. Comg. Murray. He has also forwarded to the office specimens of the bottom taken in sounding. The party in the steamer Bibb was employed during part of the autumn in Section II. Qff-shore s011mfings.-From two positions off Fernandina (Sketch No. 15) lines of soundings were extended by Lieut. Comg. Murray in running with the steamer Bibb southward and westward towards St. Augustine, and thence southward, in general conformity with the trend of the eastern coast of Florida, to positions north and south of Indian River inlet. In that vicinity the lines were deflected and carried quite across the current of the Gulf Stream, and will be again alluded to in remarks nuder that head . .At the termination of one of his lines, about fifteen miles northeast of Indian River inlet, .Lieut. Comg. Murray found a shoal with only four fathoms, and distant from the main coast of Florida about ten nautical miles. This off-shore work was performed after the completion of the survey of St. Augustine harbor, and after the return to Charleston and transfer of the party from the vessel used in that service. The following statistics are taken from the returped chart of off-shore work:

Hydmgraphy of the Florida reef.-On the outer side of the general line of keys the hydrography of the Florida reef has been continued from the vicinity of Coffin's Patches (Sketch No. 16) in a direction northward and eastward to Lower Matacumba key. The soundings were extended bTOad off about six miles, and are <:onformable. with the complered portions of the reef hydrography. This duty was executed by the party of Lieut. Comg. John Wilkinson, U.S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, with the steamer Corwin. The work wa.s ta.ken up on the 16th of Janaa.ry, and

Comg. T. A. Craven, and leaves a reach of rather more than twenty miles to be sounded between Rodriguez bank and Lower Matacumba key in order to complete the general chart of the Florida reef. In the course of his duty this season, Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson made a careful examination of Tennessee shoal, which lies about four nautical miles S. by E. (by compass) from the east end of Long key. The shoal (so-called) was found to be more properly a group of shoals, the outer and most dangerous (one as being at an elbow of the reef, and near its edge) having only twelve feet water. About a mile and a quarter from the outer shore of Grassy key the position of a sunken wreck was determined and marked by the party in the Corwin. The obstruction lies in twelve feet water on the northern edge of the Hawk channel, and bears south, (by compass,) distant about two miles from the middle of the key. I have given in the .Appendix (No. 14) a copy of my communication to the department, with extracts from the report of Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson relative to these dangers. Reference will be made, under another head, to the incidental advantage afforded of testing, by a short run of the vessel, the new form of sounding apparatus devised by Professor Trow· bridge. The trials of the apparatus were made in the middle of March. After the return of the steamer Corwin to Key West, Lieut. Oomg. Wilkinson, on being applied to by the agent of underwriters, went to the assistance of the .American ship Sarah G. Hyde, and found her water-fogged and unmanageable, about thirty miles to the westward of the Marquesas. The vessel was towed by the Corwin into Key West harbor. Under the heads Gulf Stream and Section VIII, reference will be made to the subsequent labors of this party. Magnetic observait"ons at Key West, Fla.-A station has Leen established at Key West for the purpose of obtaining for a considerable period a constant record of the magnetic variations. The instruments employed are made self-registering by the application of photography, according to the plan devised by Mr. Charles Brooke, of London. Those now in use at Key West were obtained through the co-operation of the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and the observations were made in the same connection. The i1se of a wooden building on the grOllnds of Fort Taylor was procured from the Engineer Department for a temporary observatory. The instruments at the station were mounted and put in operation by Professor W. P. Trowbridge, Assistant. Mr. Samuel Walker aided in that service. The ad van~ of tin~ photographic method for obtaining a continuous record of the variations of the magnet, as regards both economy and Mcuracy, bas been fully demonstrated. .A single observer, to prepare and renew the photographic sheets, to keep the lamps in order, and to have general oversight of the operations, accomplishes, by this method, the work of several persons. The method is well known, but will be here referred to in brief. The magnets al'e suspended in the ordinary manner, each luffing a small mirror attached to it, which partakes of its 'angular motion. .A lamp kept constantly burning is so placed that the light falls on the

72

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

mirror. and from it is reflected to a cylinder placed at some distance from the magnet. The cylin<l~r is covered neatly by a sheet of paper rendered highly sensitive to the light, and is made to rcyo]ve once in twenty-four hours by means of ordinary clock-work. The angular motions of the magnet, whether caused by the usual changes of the magnetism of the earth, or by unusual disturbances, are tlrns traced upon the paper, with a rncord of the time of their occurrence. Since tbe 1st of March of the present year continuous records ~ave been obtained in this wav. In conn~ction with the differential obserYations others have been made monthly for the absolute v:1lucs of the magnetic declination, dip, aud intensity at Key West. In these a set of portable instruments was used by Mr. Walker, who made the determination for :February, March, April, May, and June. The continuation of the series since June haYe been in charge of Mr. G. D. Allen, of Key West. Tidal obsen:ation.s.-The series of observa6ons at Fort Clinch, near Fernandina, .Amelia island, Fla., has been kept up continuously by Mr . .J. .A. Walker with one of the Saxton selfregistering tide-gauges. At Tortugas the series has been continued with a self-regi1'tering instrument by Mr. H. Benners. This important station has been selected as a permanent one in order to have a standard of reference for facilitating the investigation of the laws of the tides observed along the Florida reef and within the Gulf of l\fexico. The observations now extend through several years, and haYe already furnished data for obtaining many valuable results. It having been found impracticable to trace out the anomalies of the tides of the Gulf of Mexico from the detached and comparatively short series of observations hitherto made, the plan has been adopted, as referred to in my last annual report, of occupying a chain of stations along the Florida keys and Gulf coast, and conducting the operations so as to make the results obtained for each place comparable with the others through those given by the standard station of reference at Tortugas. The observations at each of the stations have been, generally, extended to a full year, and hence are minute]y comparable with each other. They will thus furnish data for follo"'ing the changes of the different tide waves step by step in their advance along the coast. In pursuing this plan three sets of stations have been successively occupied, and those at which the observations are yet in progress will extend the chain to Isle Derniere, west of the mouths of the Mississippi river. Self-registering tide-gauges have been used in executing th<1 scheme here alluded to. These were under the general charge of Mr. Gustavus Wurdemann, a faithful and experienced observer, until the time of his death, which took place late in the last surveying year. He was succeeded by :Mr. A. C. Mitchell, who is now, with the aid of competent observers, employed in extending the chain of stations to the westward, as will be detailed in chapter VIII.
F STREAM.

Explorations similar to those heretofore made in the current of the Gulf Stream have been continued this year in the vicinity of the 'l'ortugas. From thence a line of soundings was run southwest about seventy-five miles, by Lieut. Comg. John Wilkinson, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, in the steamer Corwin, and from that limit taken southeast to the coast of Cuba. Ten positions were determined iu depth, and at each the temperature of the water was noted at the surface, and at ten, twenty, thirty, fifty, one hundred, and one hundred and fifty fathoms. Lieut. Comg. Alex. Murray, U.S. N., Assistant, in the steamer Bibb, ran, in June last, two lines from Gilberts' bar, on the eastern coast of the peninsula of Florida., between Indian riv{)r and Jupiter inlet, across to the Bahama banks, one line on a course north of east and the other southeast. Of these Professor Trowbridge says: ''The first section commences about twei.ity-five miles from the coast. The depths obtained on this line furnish an approximate sectmn of the bottom, in which one of the ridges parallel to the coast before discoverud further

north, and indicated also in the Cape Florida section, distinctly appears. It occurs about thirty-five miles from the coast on the line of the section. The temperature observations are not sufficient in number to construct a diagram of the section all the way across. '' The next section, however, gives better results, though the temperatures were not taken often enough below fifty fathoms. The number of stations occupied was ten, the bottom being reached at each station. "In the diagram representing the change of temperature with depth, it is necessary to connect the temperature at fifty fathoms ·with the bottom temperature by the form of curve which experience has established, as there are no intermediate temperatures. The diagrams representing the change of temperature across the stream exhibit two bands of cold water besides the cold wall, the latter feature being a marked one. It occurs about eleven miles from the coast. "This section seems to confirm fully the conclusions arrived at from the Cape Florida section, that the bands of the Gulf Stream have their origin near the latter section. It will be observed that the section of the bottom on the second line of Lieut. Comg. Murray, from Gilbert's bar southeast, does not exhibit in a marked manner the ridges which undoubtedly exist there, while the temperatures indicate them distinctly. The explanation of this may be that the ridges here have a moderate elevation which will require more frequent soundings for their detection, while, at the same time, they may bear the same relation to the total depth (which is small) that the same ridges further north bear to the depths in those rtJgions, and the forcing up of the cold polar current beneath is apparent in using the thermometer, even though the elevations are small. That they exist, however, the diagrams leave no room to doubt." Both of the sections run from Gilbert's bar are shown on Sketch No. 22. The new method of sounding described in my last annual report has been successfully tested by Professor W. P. Trowbridge, .Assist.ant, who took passage for the purpose on board the steamer Corwin, and made the run near the Tortugas already alluded to. The results of the experiments made justify the belief that for sounding in a rapid current, or in very deep water, the method proposed by .Assistant Trowbridge will prove more successful than any other. While employed in t.he off-shore hydrography between Charleston and Fernandina, Lieut. Oomg. Bankhead made temperature observations between the coast and 1he western limits of the Stream. The following remark taken from his report applies more particularly to the lateral influence exerted between Fernandina and Savannah, in still weather, by the great current in its prog1·ess northward from the Straits of Florida. Lieut. Comg. Bankhead says: "On three separate occasions, when in eighteen to twenty fathoms water, and far removed, as I supposed, from its influence, I have experienced a current of three miles an hour setting to the northward and eastward, and that during good weather, and when no violent gales bad occurred to affect the body of the stream. The general set of the current over the whole of that section of the coast is northerly, as is always shown in running lines parallel to the shore by the ditference between the true and the computed positions of the vessel employed in sounding.' 1 The temperature observations made this season by Lieut. Corng. Wilkinson seem to indicate that some position bet\veen the Tortugas and Cape San .Antonio is the point of junction of two distinct currents coming eastward, one around the cape, and the other from the Gulf of Mexico, and passing thence on as the Gulf Stream through the Straits of Florida. 10 c

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

SECTION YII.
FROM ST. JOSEPH'S BAY TO J.'.OBILE BAY, INCLUDING PART OF THE WF$TERN COAST OF FLORIDA AND THE COAST OF ALABAMA.-(BuTca G, No. 25)

The surve·· in this section has been in full activity, and the increased experience of the assistants lids told uotably in the quantity of work executed. The triangulation has nearly reached the southern limit of the section from the Cedar Keys cent.re, and is continuous from Ocilla river westward to Cape San Blas. The topography has kept pace with it, and important additions have been made to the hydrography. A. synopsis from the detailed ~tatements of progress is here given, and will be followed by the notices at length : 1. Difference of longitude determined by telegraph between Apalachicola, Fla., Eufaula, .Ala., and Macon, Ga., and observations made for latitude, azimuth, and the magnetic elements. The longitude determinations eonnect at Macon with a serie1:1 which is now continuous from tho 110rtheastern boundary of ibe United States to New Orleans. 2. An extension to the entrance of St. Joseph's bay of the triangulation on the western side of the Florida peninsula from Bayport. 3. A triangulation cast and west of St. Mark's harbor, completing the connection between the survey of Ocilla river entrance and that of St. George's som1d, Fla., and triangulation of St. Vincent's sound completed westward to Cape Sau Blae. 4. The triangulation and plane-table survey of :M:aria de Galvez and East bays completed, and progress made nearly completing the preliminary survey of Blackwater bay. The work embracing these waters connects with the survey of Pensacola harbor, Fla. 5. A preliminary base measured, and triangulation laid out to include the lower part of Perdido bay. 6. PJane-table eurveys completed at the entrances of the W e·thlocco-cbee and Homosassa riven:. These complete the topography betwee11 Cedar Keys and the mouth of the Chassahowitzka river, Fla. 7. Topography of the shores of Appalachee bay completed between Ocilla river and St. George's sound; and progress made in the plane-table survey of St. James' s island, Fla. 8. A hydrographic survey of the Cedar Keys channels, and soundings made on a line from Sea-Horse reef southward to Egmont key, (Tampa bay;) and from Sea·Horse reef westward to Pensacola entrance. 9. The bydrography of Apalac11icola harbor, Fla., completed, including the adjacent waters of St. George's sound eastward, to Cat Point., and the hydrography of the eastern part of the sound from Southwest Cape to Crooked river. The hydrography of this part of the sound is now complete to Royal Bluff. 10. A hydrographic survey completed in Maria de Galvez and East bays, and nearly completed in Escambia and Blackwater bays, and connected with the soundings of Pensacola. harbor, Fla. 11. Tidal observations made with self-registering gauges at St. Mark's harbor; in St. George's and St. Vincent's sounds, and at Pensacola harbor. The"'e stations form links of a series established for the development of the tidal peculiarities of the Gulf of Mexico. As an adjunct of the hydrographic work, views have been drawn of the more marked features of the coast for the charts of Cedar Keys, St. George's sound, and Pensacola harbor. Office-u:ork.-Progress has been mrtde in the drawing of general coast chart No. XIII, Gnlf coast, from Waccasassa bay to Choctawhatchee bay, Fla.; on preliminary sea-coast chart No. 25, from Santa Rosa eound to MobiJc bay; on l'Oast map and chart No. 81, from Ohassahowitzka river to Cedar Keys; on Nos. 84: and 85, from Ocilla river to Cape San Blas; and on No. 88,

from Choctawhatchee bay to Pensacola bay. The drawing of charts of Apalachicola bay and Escambia and Santa Maria de Galvez bays is now in hand. Additions have been made in drawing and engraving to the chiirt of St. George's sound (eastern part) to that of Pensacola harbor, and to the progress plate. A comparative chart of Pcnsacohi harbor has been drawn, and lines of deep·sea soundings have been added to the general sketch of the Gulf of ~foxico. Telegraphic determination ef longitude at Apalachicola, Fla., and Ell[au(a, Ala.-In order to determine the correct geographical position of one of the points in the triangulation of St. George's sound, an astronomical party was organized in November of last year and placed under the direction of Assistant George W. Dean. The observations to be made included the connection of one of the stations near Apalachicola with the longitude station occupied at lfacon, Georgia, in the spring of 1856; the determination of the latitude of Apalachicola, and also the azimuth of a line in the triangulation. Those for latitude and azimuth, and the magnetic observations made by the same party, will be noticed under separate heads. Sub-Assistant Edward Goodfellow took charge of the astronomical instruments and telegraphic implements, and forwarded them from Baltimore early in December. Mr. Dean, meanwhile, had proceeded to )facon and made preparatory trials to determine the practicability of carrying on the observations by means of a single circuit. The result showed the expe· diency of an intermediate station, and Eufaula, Ala., was selected as the best connecting one in the telegraphic series. The general superintendent, J. R. Dowell, esq., and Messrs. F. Howe and J. C. Butler, superintendents of the Columbus and Apalachicola, and the Macon and Mobile telegraph companies, respectively, had kindly placed their lines at the disposal of the Coast Survey for the requisite uses after their regular business hours at night. Temporary observatories having been put up at Eufaula and Apalachicola, Messrs. Dean and Goodfellow observed at the last-named station for personal equation, and then alternately at the two stations through the telegraph line for difference of longitude. One hundred star sig~als were successfully exchanged by the observers on four uig·hts, and similar exchanges of one hundred and three signals were made during five favorable nights between the stations at Eufaula and Macon. Chronographic comparisons were made on two nights, and the error and rate of each of the clocks used were well determined before and after the comparisons by telegraph. At Apalachicola three hundred and ten observations were made on sixty-s{'ven stars for local time and instrumental corrections. Sixty-one others were.made there on seven, and at lfacon seventeen observations on five circumpolar stars, in deducing the value of the thread intervals of Transit No. 6. That for Transit No. 8 was determined at Eufaula by sixty-four obser· vations on eight circumpolar stars. The local time at that station and at Macon, and the instrumental corrections, were ascertained by aggregate of over six hundred observations, sixty stars being used at Eufaula and sixty-five at Macon. In his report, .Assistant Dean expresses his obligations for facilities extended to his party by the public authorities of the several cities at which stations were occupied in the course of the season. Latitude OOsfff'vations at Apakwhicola, Fla., and at Eufaula, .Ala.-These were made by Sub.Assistant Goodfollow, with the zenith telescope, C. S. No. 5, a total of about three hundred and seventy observations being recorded. Thirty-three pairs of stars were observed, exclusive of the circumpolar stars Polaris and 51 Cephei, on which a hundred and twenty-two observations were made near elongation for the micrometer divisions of the instrument. Triangu:Iati.on and azimuth at Apalaclticola.-In connecting· the longitude station with the triangulation of St. George's sound, Assistant Dean recorded three hundred and twenty-eight angular measurements. These were made with the two feet theodolite, C. S. No. 2, in five positions of the instrument. The azimuth of the lines of the triangulation was determine9 by seventy-two observations

on 1 Ursce Minoris, near its lower culmination, and seventy on PUlaris, near its western elon· gation, in connection with one hundred and twenty observations on an elongation mark. J-Iagnetic observations al Apalachi:cola and Eufmda.-The magnetic declination was determined by Assistant Dean, at Apalachicola, by one hundred and eighteen observations, made on three davs. For the horizontal intensity and moment of inertia, two sets of observations were m~de on different days. The magnetic dip was obtained from three complete sets on three days. At Eufaula similar sets of observations were made to determine the several magnetic elements. At both stations ~Ir. Dean used the declinometer D 22, (C. S. No. 1,) and the dip' circle C. S. No. 4. Meridian line.-While the observations for longitude were in progress at Eufaula, Ala., Assistant Dean was requested by the city authorities to establish and mark for public use a meridian line in that vicinity. Suitable stone blocks for marking the ends baying been provided by the authorities, Mr. Dean promptly complied with their request, and made the requisite astronomical observations with the forty-six inch transit C. S. No. 8. The line ranges through and nearly along the middle of l!,orsyth street, and is about nineteen hundred and forty-eight feet in length. Its ends are marked by small drill holes in the stone blocks, which were sunk two feet and a half into the ground, the tops being left even with the surface. Meteorowgical observations.-The usual meteorological journals were kept during the season at Macon, Eufaula, and Apalachicola, by Messrs. A. W. Thompson and W. D. Storke, the aids attached to the party of Assistant Dean. Readings of the barometer were recorded at all the stations, in connection with readings of the wet and the dry bulb thermometers. Messrs. Thompson and Storke also recorded the astronomical observations as they were made, and aided in the determinations for longitude. Assistant Dean returned to the office early in May, and during the remainder of the season was employed in Section I. All the records connected with the observations for longitude, latitude, azimuth, and magnetic and meteorological observations at Macon, Eufaula, and Apalachicola, have been deposited in the office at Washington. Ooa.~t tri"angulation south ef Bayport, Fla.-The triangulation of the western coast of the Florida peninsula south of Cedar keys was resumed on the 25th of November by Sub-Assistant G. H. Bagwell, aided b;r Mr. M. 0. Hering, working with a party in the schooner Joseph Henry. After joining at Raccoon Point (Sketch No. 25) with the stations used last year, Mr. Bagwell extended the triangulation down the coast, passing Bayport, and going southward and westward to the North Anclote keys and Tiger Point. This chain of triangles ranges about thirty-five miles in length from the junction referred to. The instruments used in measuring the angles were the eight-inch No. 36, (Gambey,) and the six-inch Bronner theodolite No. 58. '' The coast included in this triangulation is of the same character as that described in the report of last season. As in previous years, the operations were much retarded by the difficult and dangerous navigation over St. Martin's reef. Below the Anclote keys the coast will be found much more favorable than above, for transportation, and tl.e work can be extended south· ward from its present limits, into St. Joseph's bay, with greater rapidity than heretofore." The site for a preliminary and verification base selected last season being yet fifte·en miles in advance of the triangulation, its measurement has been deferred, for greater convenfonce, until the approaching winter. The arrangements, however, have been fully made, and A8Bistant Gerdes has been instructed to determine the length of the line. The course and extent of the work done between Bayport and Tiger Point are she>wn on Sketch No. 25.

Field-work was suspended on the 10th of March. The party then returned to New York, and after laying up the vessel, Mr. Bagwell commenced the revision of his records, and went on with the computations connected with the triangulation. Se·eral years' experience having shown the impracticability of keeping the plane-table work south of Cedar keys up with the triangulation, the party heretofore joined with Sub-Assistant Bagwell worked separately, in order to fill the gap necessarily left while the means required by both parties were supplied with but one vessel. The operations of the plane-table party will be again referred to in the course of this report. .As heretofore, such incidental assistance was rendered to it by the party in the Joseph Henry as the steady progress of the triangulation permitted. A duplicate of the journal of horizontal angles measured below Bayport has been received from Mr. Bagwell. Triangulation between 0CT1la river and St . .,lfark' s, Fla.-A. complete connection has been made between the preliminary survey of Ocilla river and that of St. George's sound, and between both and the survey of St. Mark's harbor. This duty was performed by Sub-Assistant S. C. McCorkle between the 7th of December and the close of the following month, the party being then transferred to another locality of the section. In prosecuting the field-work he was aided by Mr. Rufus King, jr., and had in charge the schooner Torrey for transporting camp equipage and instruments. The joinings of the triangulation are shown on Sketch No. 25. Mr. McCorkle occupied St. Mark's light-house with the six-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 55, with which all the angular measurements were made, and, by removing the panes of glass temporarily, succeeded in observing on the adjacent stations connected with it in the scheme. An attempt was made to determine the exact position of the Ocklokouee shoal, but without success. the means at the disposal of the land party not admitting of the erection of a suitable signal. It was intended, at the outset of the season, to have a screw-pile signal inserted for the purpose by the hydrographic party, but the calls upon it for general duty postponed that service. In its next return to this section means will be provided for making the requisite determination. The triangulation 011 the western part of the coast of Florida is now continuous from Ocilla river, thrnugh St. George's sound, to Cape San Blas, a distance, measured along the sides of the angles, of ninety-five miles. The particulars of the work east of the sound are here given, as compiled from the fieldbooks returned by Mr. McCorkle: Signals erected ··· · · · · · · · . . . . · · . · · · · · .., · . · · · · · · .. - . · . · . · · · · · . - . . . 6 Stations occupied .. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · - · · · · · . · · · · .·... 9 Angles measured · · · · · · · · · . · · · · · · - · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · .. · · . · · . · · · ... 35 Number of observations···.·· . · · - · · · · ..·. · .. · ...· - ..... ·.... . . . . . . . 720 For purposes of verification two of the stations used between St. Mark's and Southwest cape were reoccupied. The triangles of the entire series closed well when tested in the usual way. Under the head following will be detailed the further service executed by the party in this section of the coast. Triangulation <f St. Vincent's sound, Fla.-This work is an extension to the westward of the triangulation of St. George's sound, the completion of which has been already reported. On the 21st of March Sub-Assistant McCorkle took up work at the line ''Oyster Cove Middle Bayon," (Sketch No. 25,) and established points at intervals along the coast of the Gulf, towards Cape San Blas. Thes~ connect with others on St. Vincent's island, and complete the triangulation of St. Vincent's sound, beyond which, from stations at Indian Pass and St. Vincent's island, the work was continued to the cape, whore it was closed for the season on the 20th of April.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Mr. Rufus King aided in the operations of this party. Hub-Assistant :McCorkle thus remarks in reference to the means for continuing the triangulation towards St. Andrew's bay, around the abrupt turn of the coast at Cape San Blas: "I do not anticipate any further tro:ible in continuing the work over St. Joseph's bay, and towards St. Andrew's, beyond the labor of opening two or three lines." Some of the lines requiring to be cut through in the triangulation of this season involved severe hardship, particularly on St. Vincent's island, the parts of it necessarily traversed being made up of a succession of ponds and marshes. 'l'he latter part of the season, moreover, was-, very unfavorable, the atmosphere being obscured for a period of six weeks by fires in the woods along the shores of St. Vincent's sound. The statistics of the work are returned as follows: Signals erected · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 9 Stations observed from · · · · · · · · · · · - · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 8 Angles measured . · · . · · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 30 N uu1ber of observations · . · .... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 630 The angles were measured with the six-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 55. While engaged in this vicinity, Mr. McCorkle made a reconnaissance for a primary base line near Apalachicola, and reports that a practicable site can be had, giving a le11gth of from threo and a half to four miles. He states, also, th~t the line would join readily with the triangulation and astronomical points on St. George's sound, and be con venicnt of measurement. At the end ef the working season the schooner 'l'orrey, which had been used by the party in this section, returned north, and was lCJid up at New York. Triangulation qf Santa Maria de Galvez, B7ackwater, and East bays, Fl,a.-As a base for this work, Assistant F. H. Gerdes selected the line which connects Emanuel Point and GarQOn Point, (Sketch No. 25,) both of those stations having been occupied in his triangulation of Pensacola bay. From general knowledge of the practicability of the lines required for the survey of Maria de Galvez bay, Mr. Gerdes put up the requi;;;ite signals in March, though the haze which then prevailed shut out of view from each other the stations intended to be con· nected by the observations. In the latter part of that month and the beginning of April, when the atmosphere was so far improved as to render the signals barely visible, two theodolites were employed; the second by Sub-Assistant C. Fendall, under the immediate direction of Assistant Gerdes. The triangles include, as will be seen by the sketch already referred to, the entire shores of Santa Maria de Galvez and its two dependencies, the Blackwater and East bays, and connect those waters with the survey of Pensacola and Escambia bays. To overcome, in some degree, the unfavorable circumstances under which the observations were made, Mr. Gerdes occupied several of the stations twice, and from others reobserved single angles, and deems it necessary, from the cause just alluded to, that angular measurements should be repeated from two of the principal stations in clear weather. This will be done, if practicable, in the course of the coming winter. The statistics of the triangulation are as follows: Signals erected · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · · .·.. · . . . . . . . . . . . . · . · · . . . . . 13 Stations occupied · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · .. · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . · 7 Angles measured · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · - · · · ...· · . . . · . · . · · · 43 Number of observations· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·, · . . . . . . . . . . · 372 Of the signals erected, eight were elevated tripod1:1, with scaffolds f"or the theodolite. The instruments Rsed were the twelve-inch Ga.mbey, C. S. No. 16, and the six-inch Gambey theo· dolite, C. S. No. 7 5 . .In order to complete the preliminary work a:t the head of Blackwater bay, some few stations will be occupied above Perry's Mill, which is the present northern limit of the triangala.tioil~ Mr. Gerdes had in charge the schooner James Hall, for transportation. His party executed

also the plane-table survey, which advanced as points were furnished by the preliminary work, as will be further noticed under the head of topography. Other duty performed by the party of Assistant Gerdes in triangulation and topography will be stated in the succeeding chapter. TrimigUlation qf Perdido bay, Fla. and Ala.-Under the immediate direction of Assistant Gerdes, a reconnaissance for this work was made early in April by Sub-As11istant J. G. Oltmanns. A site was selected near the entrance of the Lower Reach for a preliminary base, the location of which is marked on Sketch No. 25. The- line l"rns twice measured with a twenty metre chain, verified in length before and after each measurement, giving for the length ~f the base 812.45 metres. Having erected and secured a sufficient number of signals, Mr. Oltmanns proceeded with the angular measurements, using the eight-inch Wtirdemann theodolite, C. S. No. 87. The triangulation was laid out 1o include the entrance to Perdido bay and the lower part of the two reaches, extending also across the main body of the bay, below Sol<lier's creek. The following summary shows the progress made in the work: Signals set up···. · · · · · · ·. · .. ·. ·. · . · · · · · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·. · · · · · · · · · Stations used. · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · , · · · ·.

Soundings were made by the land party with the schooner Gerdes through both channels of the entrance into Perdido bay. The result of that reconnaissance, as compared with local information derived by Assistant Gerdes in regard to the depth found the year before, would seem to show an increased capacity of the channels. The change, if not merely temporary in character, may be of considerable importance, and in allusion to it Mr. Gerdes remarks: "The Perdido bar has but little water, and is said to be shifting, or at least has shifted. On account of the abundance of the best kind of timber, which extends back for several miles along the shores of the bay, a favorable improvement in the character of the bar would be of vast consequence. At present a portion of the lumber finds way to market by a branch railroad which connects the Montgomery and Pensacola line with the upper waters of the Perdido." Under the head of Section VIII mention will be made of other duty performed by SubAssistant Oltmanns. He was aided in field-work by Mr. G. U. Mayo. The preliminary survey at Perdido bay was closed for the season in the latter part of April. Mr. Gerdes then proceeded north, and took up his office-work. Topography of the We-thlooco-cltee and Homosassa river entrances, Fla.-Tbe survey of these entrances, which had been deferred in the progress of the joint work of triangulation and topography south of Cedar keys, for a reason already given, has been completed, and the land· work is now continuous from Cedar keys, southward, as far as Raccoon. Point, in the direction to St. Joseph's bay. Sub-Assistant N. S. Finney, provided with a boat and camp fixtures, took up the planetable survey about a mile north oft.he mouth of the W e-thlocco-chcc in the middle of Decern ber. The sheet of that vicinity unites on the north and south with two executed by him in the working season of 1857-' 58, the gap in the topography being left, as explained in my last report, to avoid delay in pushing forward the triangulation. This interval includes a stretch, eoastwise, of about eight miles, and, besides- the mouth of the river last named, takes in the Gulf shore between it and the mouth of Crystal river, as will be seen on the progress Sketch No. 25. On the same sheet Mr. Finney traced the anchorages and boat channels along the shore, as also those leading into the mouths of the rivers. The work intervening between the portions done last season, including the shores and features of the Florida coast in the neighborhood of Homosassa bay, was resumed on the 10th

of January, and carried to a junction, north and south, with the completed topography. Owing to unfavorable weather, and a loug succession of very low tides, the topography was much retarded, but the gap was completely filled in by the 16th of February. "The character of the coast of Florida in these two gaps is very much like that found above and below, and as described in previous reports. It is a continued belt of marsh, cut by innumerable creeks and bayous, extending, in some places, ten miles towards the interior of the peninsula. Hundreds of small islands are found, partly covered with stunted mangroves, and nearly all overflowed at high water. The channels being left quite dry at low tid@ has rendered the survey tedious and difficult."

The triangulation in this quarter is now a full season in advance of the topography, hut a suitable boat and fixtures for separate working having been provided, it is hoped that the plane-table party may soon be able to overtake it. For some miles to the southward of Raccoon Point, the present limit of the topographical survey, the nature of the coast presents the same difficulties which mark it between that point and Cedar keys; but nearer to the .A.nclote keys and St. Joseph's bay the obstacles to progress are not so great. Some general remarks made by Sub-Assistant Finney in reference to the western coast of Florida, and applying more particularly to the rivers which empty into the Gulf of Mexico, between Cedar keys and Bayport, will be found in Appendix No. 32. Throughout the entire range of his plane-table work the anchorages in the bays, and near the mouths of the rivers, have been carefully noted on the sheets containing them, and the channels leading up the rivers, to the distance of several miles, have been staked out, and are, in like manner, traced on the maps . .At the close of the season Mr. Finney stored his camp equipments near the mouth of Homosassa river, and returned north to complete his office-work. In referring to friendly acts bearing on the discharge of his duties, mention is made of the names of Hon. A. G. Steele, Capt. J. Tucker, W. P. Thigpen, esq., and Col. E. H. Richards, of Cedar Keys; Major J. Parsons, of Bayport, and A. B. Hahn, esq., of Homosassa. The work: in his charge was furthered also by incidental assistance from the party of Sub-Assistant Bagwell, in the schooner Joseph Henry. :Mr. Finney bas inked and turned in three sheets of his topographical work of 1858-' 59, and the sheet containing the surveys made this season. Topography of .Appalachee bay and ef Crooktd river, (St. George's sound,) Fla.-The planetable survey of the coast of Florida, between Ocilla river and St. Mark's harbor, and from St. Mark's entrance, westward, to the mouth of Ocklokonee bay, was taken up by .A..ssistant G. D. Wise in the middle of December, aud completed by the end of February. Bis party in the schooner Howell Cobb was then transferred to St. James' s island, and there resumed the survey of the shores of Crooked river, towards the completion of which considerable progress wail made before closing work on the last of April. In reference to the character of the topograJ>by on the shores of .A.ppalachee bay (see Sketch No. 25) Assistant Wise observes: "The main land east and west &f St. Mark's is very l<>w, and the marshes extend a long distance back. Our anchorage was on the open coast, between two and three miles from the land, in six or seven feet water, and at low tide our smell hoe.ts would ground when a mile from the shore, which was reached with much difficulty through the ruud."

The plane-table work of this party embraces the Gulf shore from Ocilla river, westward, to the completed survey of St. Mark's, and beyond it, in the same direction, the shores of Dickerson's and Oyster bays, to a junction with the topography of St. George's sound. The course of Crooked river, to a distance of aliout fifteen miles along the western side of St . .James's island, was surveyed 011 a separate sheet, leaving a portion of it yet to be completed on the upper side of the island. The progress made by the party is show11 in the following trnmrnary: Shore-line surveyed. - .. · . · · .. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Roads · · ..·....... · ... · · ·. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Area of topography, (square miles) · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 155 miles. 1l 'iO

On the return passage the vessel reached Baltimore on the 11th of May, ancl was afterwards employed by Mr. Wise in Section III. The following remark in the report of Assistant 'Vise refers to peculiarities of tlie coast of Florida in the vicinity of Ocilla river: ''Many of the streams are ~nbterranean, Loiling up from great depths in springs of perfoct clearness. The Ocilla, W acissa, Wakulla, and Spring creek, all comprised within the limits of my rnrvcy, are of this character. I found bottom in the Wakulla spring at eighty-eight feet, the lead being plainly visible at that depth." Topography cf Santa Maria de Galvez, Blackwater, and East bays, Fla.-It has been already noticed that the preliminary work for the survey of these dependencies of Pensacola bay was executed by Assistant Gerdes, in March last. 'l'he topography was based on points provided in the progress of the triangulation, and went on with it jointly. On the west side of Santa Maria de G'l.lvez bay and Blackwater bay, which forms its northern arm and is continuous with its shores, the plane-table survey was extended from White Point (see Sketch No. 26) upwards to Robinson's Point. The south and east shores and land adjacent to the water-line were surveyed from Redfish Point to the head of East bay, and from thence to Catfish Point, which is nearly opposite, to the limit reached on the eastern side of Blackwater bay. At present the topography rests a little below the triangulation, but will advance with it to a point a short distance above the head of that branch of )faria de Galvez bay. Sub-Assistant Clarence Fendall assisted Mr. Gerdes in the triangulation and plane-table work. A synopsis of the last is thus given in the summary report from the field: Shore-line surveyed . - .................... · . · · · · · _. · · · · · · · · · · · · · Area, i11 square miles ... · · ..... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 43 rniles.

The atmosphere was very much obscurecl by smoke and haze while the party was employed

in this section.
For carrying on the work from station to station the schooner .James Hall was used. Assistant Gerdes furnished the shore-line of his survey for the use of the hydrographic party of Lieut. Comg. Phelps. Hydrograpliic examination of the Cedar Keys channels, Fla.--Between the 20th of .Jannary and the middle of the following month a thorough examination was made of the s,>,a-Horse Key channel, the Northwest channel, and the North Key passage, into the harbor of Cedar Keys, by the party in the steamer Walker, under Lieut. Comg. J. J. Guthrie. U. S. N., Assistant. The results obtained do not differ materially when compared with the soundings made in the previous examinations, showing, however, less water on the bars. 'l'his survey was made under some disadvantages, in advance of taking up work to which the hydrographic party had been assigned in Section VIII, notice of which will be taken in its place.

In connection with the hydrography, observations were made on the 23d of January and 3d of February for determining the rate of the current off Depot key. Tlie original records of the work done this year at Cedar Keys were loHt by the sinking of the steamer Walker in June last, off Absecom, N. J. Lieut. Comg. Guthrie, on landing af, Norfolk after returning from thi8 section, brought to ·washington the fair journal of the soundings, arid thus it was saved from the disaster which destroyed the results ot an arduous season's labor. Hydrograpl;y qf St. Geor:1e' s sound, Fla.-A large advance lrns been made towards the completion of the hydrograph,r of St. George's sound by a party in charge of Lieut. Comg. T. S. Phelps, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, in the steamer Vixen. In the immediate vicinity of .Apalachicola, and to the eastward and westward between Cat Point and St. Vincent's Point, (Sketch No. 25,) the hydrography is now complete, and soundings have been made from Crooked river to Southwest cape, supdementary to the survey of the channel which leads into St. George's sound past the eastern end of Dog island. This work, it will be recollected, was in progress last season, when the hyclrographic operations were suspended by the death of Lieut.. Comg. Dne1·, while in charge of the steamer Vixen. 'The space included in the work of this year stretchei" about fifteen miles along shore, from Southwest cape westward, with an average breadth of al)out three miles, and embraces Alligator harbor. In sounding near Apalachicola, Lieut. Corng. Phelps joined his work with the survey of the West Pass made by Lieut. Comg. Duer in 1858, and extended the hydrograpy of the body of the Aotm<l em;tward to Bulkhead Point and northward to St. Mark's Point, in Eastern bay, a short distance ahove Apalachicola. The only part of St. George's sound yet to be covered by the hydrography lies between Cat Point and Royal bluff. During the month of January the progress of the party was much hindered by adverse weather and by fogs and high winds. The '\\Tork near Apalachicola was completed at the end of :b'ebruary, and that in the eastern part of the sound within the first three weeks of May, the party 1Jeing in the interval employed at a third locality of this section.

In the following extract from the report of Lieut. Comg. Phelps it is suggested that a change, favorable to the interests of navigation and commerce, may be now going on, tending towards improvement in the depth of water at the East Pass into the sound. He says: " A new channel seems to be opening into the East Pass anchorage to the northward and westward of the present channel. On crossing the bar my attention was called to a dark line of water througli the reef, and the boat despatched to sound it found fifteen feet at mean low water. Another season will probably decide whether this channel is to be of value or not. My impression is that a deeper and better channel is opening into the East Pass anchorage." Three tidal stations were occupied in connection with the hydrographic duties of the party. While at Apalachicola in January, Lieut. Comg. Phelps, on being applied to by the captain of the. bark Gleaner, of Yarmouth, Me., promptly went to the relief of that vessel, the cargo of which had biken fire while sbe was Jying at the East Pai;.s. The steamer Vixen remained

in company all night, but the bark having been scuttled and the fire in her hold thereby extinguished, the steamer returned next day to her \Vorking ground. The officers and crew of the Vixen also rendered effective asBistance in stopping the ravages of a fire which broke out in Apalachicola on the morning of tho 2d of February. Liberal acknowledgment of this aid has been made by the press of that cit~·. The United States steamship Roanoke, having touched_ on several spotti in the vicinity of the Warrington navy yard during her stay there in March last, the uttcntio11 of Lieut. Comg. Phelps was directed to an examination of the character of the bottom in their vicinit,Y, but owing to detention in the mails of certain data sent to him from the office that duty w;i,; not accomplished by his party before its departure for the north. Lieut. Comg. T. A. Craven, U. S. X., formerly .Assistant in the Coast Survey, and 110\Y in command of the United State;; !>l1ip Mohawk, was incidentally at, Pensacola in October and kindly volunteered to make a preliminary examination of the locality. His soundings, made on the 9th of that month, gave a depth of twenty feet and developed a very narrow ridge, which, he suggests, may have been occasioned by a :mnken tree, around which the sand is depositing. He thinks also that the docking out from the dry dock may have some"" hat increased the deposit. Hydrography of E~cambia, lJioria de Galvez, and Blacku;afer bay.s, Fla.-The main body of each of these bays, which connect as branches with the waters of Pensacola harbor, was sounded between the 1st of March and the 25th of April, hy the party of Lit>ut. Comg. Phelps, in the steamer Vixen. In the Escambia, the hydrography was carried upwards of teh miles from its junction with the completed work at Pem;acola, or from a line crossing five miles southward and westward of Gan;:on Point. Eastward from the same line the soundings were extended so as to include the whole of the bay of Santa .Maria de Galvez, and East bay, and the main body of Blackwater bay. At the close of the season the ·work had reached Eagle Point, which is a short distance below the entrance of Yellow river.-(Sketch No. 25.) Two tidal stations were occupied and the observed rise and fall were refrrred to the bench mark at the Warrenton navy yard.

Assistant Gerdes furnished the shore-lino for th_is survey while prosecuting the topography in the vicinity, as before stated. Tl10 preliminary chart derived from the joint operations ii:; given as Sketch No. 26, with this report. The recommendations of Lieut. Comg. Phelps, for buoys near G:iryon Point, Redfi8h Point, and Bartley's Point shoal, as aids for the navigation of Pensacola harbor and its dependencies, were communicated through the department to the Light-house Boitrd in May last.-(Appen· dix No. 45.) The steamer Vixen, after receiving some slight repairs at New York, in July, was employed until the close of the season in Section I. Soundings in the Gulf qf Mexico.-ln passing to Cedar Keys, OH the 15th of Januar}', Lieut. Comg. Guthrie, U. S. N., in the steamer W a]ker, started a line off Egmont key, (Tampa,) and carried soundings along the meridian northward to Sea-Horse Key light at Cedar Keye. The greatest depth (ien fathoms) was found when the vessel was paRsing abreast of St. Joseph's bay. Throughout the entire distance the bottom brought up was coarse grey sand. On leaving Cedar Keys, in the middle of February, the same party took soundings on a 1ine due weat from the lower end of Sea-Horse Key shoal (SkC'tch No. 27) to the meridian of Pensacola, and from thence north to the entrance of that harbor. Out from Cedar Keys the slope

84

HEPORT OF THE SUPEiUNTENDENT OF

of the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico was found to be very gradual, giving a depth of only twenty-five fat horns when on the meridian of Apalachicola, and parallel of Sea-Horse key, but a little to the westward of the meridan of Cape San Blas the depth is forty-seven fathoms, and at a position nearly south of St. Aridrew's Lay the water deepens to one hundred fathoms. About thirtv miles east of the meridian of Pensacola the depth found was two hundred and ten fath;ms, and at the western end of the course run by the steamer four hundred and twenty, showing a very steep declivity in that part of the Gulf, the depth actually doubling in a western range of about twenty-five miles. The results obtained confirm, in a general way, the depths found in previous seasons by Commander B. F. Sands, U. S. N., when in charge of the hydrographic party, in the steamer Walker. On the course running north towards Pensacola, and when about sixty nautical miles from it, Lieut. Comg. Guthrie found a depth of five hundred fathoms. From that position the soundings decrease very rapidly in approaching Pensacola. On going out from Apalachicola, with the steamer Vixen, Lieut. Comg. Phelps carried a line of soundings from the South shoal, off Cape San Blas, to the outer buoy at Pensacola entrance, and on his return from extended hydrographic duty in that vicinity, which has been separately described, made soundings from the same buoy along a line to the West pass of St. George's sound. In crossing this section on his return to Key West, from special duty at Mobile, in the steamer Corwin, Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson observed with the deep-sea thermometer and recorded the temperature found in tbe Gulf water to a depth of two hundred fathoms. Besides the record of the air thermometer and the register at the depth just stated, the temperature was noted in twenty-three positions at the surface also, and at ten, thirty, and one lrnndred fat.horns. In latitude 24° 05~' N., longitude 82° 52' W-, (see Sketch No. 27,) the temperature found at one hundred and ninety fathoms was thirty-eight degrees by the Saxton thermometer, that of the surface being at. the same time eighty-three. In the Gulf sounding an aggregate of one hundred and fifty-eight casts were made. Tidal observations.-In conformity with the plan of operations sketched out in my report of last season, several self-registering tide gauges have been employed in this section, under the care of Mr. A. C. :Mitchell. With the aid of qualified observers a regular series of observations have been kept up at St. Mark's, at Dog island, at New inlet, and at St. Vincent's island. At most of these stations complete series of results were obfained and the gauges have been transferred to others in the vicinity of the Missisl'lippi delta. I am indebted to S. Thayer Abert, esq., civil engineer at the United States navy yard, at Pensacola, for the records of a self-registering gauge, the charge of which was kindly undertaken by him when it was set up at that st.ation. Through his interest in the subject the records received at the office in Washington, have been found highly satisfactory. It is expected that the observations made in this section .will, when discussed in conjunction with those taken along the Florida reef, and others near the delta of the Mississippi, furnish means for investigating the anomalies noticed in the tides of this part of the Gulf coast. SECTION VITI.
FROM MOB[LE BAY TO VERMILION BAY, INCLUDING THE COAST OF l\lISSISSIPPI AND PART OF THE COAST OF LOUISIAN A.-(SuTcH H, No. 28.)

The usual number of parties has been at work in this section, but thti loss of the records of the hydrography in the wreck of the steamer Walker, by collision at sea on her- return to the nOl'th, has caused much of the liydrographic labor to be in vain. Unless that steanwr isrepJaced, the hydrography must lag and my estimates of progress be entirely set at naught. This wonJd b~ l\ result much to be deplored, as the work of the section is so important and has made such fair progress towards completion.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

The special surveys made in Mobile harbor for the commissioners on its improvement, and at their expense, has received their grateful acknowledgments. The order of the detailed notices of work is as follows : 1. The connection of the survey of Mississippi sound with that of the delta, by triangulation from Point Fortuna, across Isle au Breton sound, to the preliminary base at the head of the passes of the Mississippi river. 2. The completion of the triangulation and topography of Cote Blanche bay, and determination of the magnetic elements at Cote Blanche island. The topography includes a part of Marsh island. 3. An extension westward of the plane-table survey of Lake Pontchartrain to Ragged Point and Bayou Le Bar. This work completes the topography of the eastern half of the lake. 4. Completion of the topography of the North, Northeast, and Southeast Passes, and Passe a Loutre, with intermediate details of the Mississippi delta, and determination of the magnetic elements. 5. A hydrographic re-survey of Mobile harbor, including the adjacent parts of the Mobile, Spanish, and Tensaw rivers, and general reconnaissance of the channel of the entire bay to the Lower Fleet. This work was executed for the commissioners authorized by the State of Alabama to decide in regard to plans for improving the water approaches of Mobile harbor. In connection wit.h it a physical examination was made, including observations of the tides and currents at various points in the bay between its head and the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 6. llydrographic surveys of Passe a Loutre, the Northeast, Korth, and Southeast Passes of the Mississippi river. The records of soundings and other material resulting from this work were lost by the sinking of the steamer Walker. By the same disaster all the notes and journals connected with a hydrographic survey of Chandeleur sound were also lost. 7. Tidal observations at thti Mississippi passes, and at Isle Demien\ for comparison with others made at stations on the eastern coast of the Gulf oi· Mexico. In the vicinity of Chandeleur island light, and of the Mississippi delta, views have been drawn for charts of the Gulf coast. Qtfice·work.-The drawing and engraving of coast map and chart No. 91, from Bon Secours bay to Round island, and of the map of the Rigolets have been completed, and additions made to the progniss sketch. Progress has been made in the drawing and engravmg of coast map and chart No. 92, from Round i8land to Grand island, La., arid in the drawing of general coast chart No. XIV, from Pensacola bay to the Mississippi delta, and coast map and chart No. 9.3, from Lake Borgne to Lake Pontchartrain. Triangulation ef the weBtern Bide ef Isle au Breton ~ound, La.-Resuming work on the 27th of November, at Point Fortuna, (Sketch No. 28,) Sub-Assistant Stephen Harris, with a party in the schooner Twilight, extended the triangulation connected with Mississippi sound, southward and westward over the islands and west shore of Isle au Breton bay, and over both shores of Oyster hay, and part of Bay Rondo, and joined at the head of the passes on the :Mississippi river with the preliminary base measured by .Assistant Gerdes in 1857. In the course of the work a number of tertiary points were determined for plane-table use in the immediate vicinity of the Mississippi, and on the shores of Isle au Breton sound. The triangulation was closed on the 12th of May, the vessel being laid up during the summer at Pascagoula. A summary from the report of Mr. Harris gives the following particulars relative to the neld-work: Stations occnpied .............···.·........... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 19 Signals observed on ····.··........·...... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 33 Nurnber of observations .·..·...·. · ..... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 3, 120 Area of triangulation, (square miles)···· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 284 On visiting the stations used in other parts of the same range of triangles, and those m

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Chandeleur sound, Sub-Assistant Harris found all the marks in good condition, excepting those at the station "Old Harbor key;" and in reference to them he says: "The island on which this station is situated appears to have been swept by the sea in the course of last summer, and all traces of the station are destroyed." Sub-Assistant R. E. Halter was attached to the triangulation party, and assisted Mr. Harris in his reconnaissance for stations, and also in making the angular measurements. The instruments used were the tcn-iuch theodolite, C. S. No. 79, and the six-inch, C. S. No. 84. The triangulation of the eastern coast of Louisiana is now continuous and complete along-, 1\fississippi sound and the main land to the western side of the delta, and embraces also the several passes of tho :Mississippi. It yet remains to connect the Chandeleur islands with the general work near the delta, and for that duty directions are now about to be issued. Mr. Charles S. Peirce served as aid in the party of Sub-Assistant Harris until the end of the working season at the south, and then resigned. · Sub-Assistant Harris lias duplicated and deposited in tho office with the originals his records of the horizontal angles measured in Isle au Breton sound, and full descriptions of the marks placed at the stations. Triangulation ef COte Blanche bay, La.-This work was resumed early in February, and has been completed by Sub-Assistant Oltmanns, with a party operating as heretofore under the general direction of Assistant Gerdes. The triangulation was taken up on the line joining COte Blanche island and !fosquito station, (Sketeh No. 28,) and from thence carried westward quite to the entrance of Vermilion bay. Owing to the high stage of water this season the schooner Gerdes, which was used in the triangulation and plane-table work, was taken without difficulty to the vicinity of the station at Cote Blanche island. All the station-marks westward of Atchafalaya are reported by Mr. Oltmanns as well secured by screw-piles or other sufficient means, and those used in past seasons can so far be readily identified. Ten points were determined in position within the range of the work of this season.

Mr. G. U. Mayo aided in the triangulation work of Cote Blanche bay. Sub-Assistant Olttnanns was subsequently employed in Section VII, as already stated. 'Topography ef Lake Pontchartrain, La.-On the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain the planetable survey has been extended by Sub-Assistant Malcolm Seaton from Bayou Bonfouca westward to a station two miles beyond Ragged Point. The details include the shell ridge, which lies a little above high water-mark, and the fringe of marsh, varying from a quarter to a mile and a quarter in width, between the lake margin and a belt of pine woods which follows the shore. The shell ridge is covered with brush and scattered live oak trees. Bayou Lacombe, the only stream of note represented on the sheet, has a good depth of water; but the bar at its mouth will admit only vessels drawing less than four feet. On the south shore of the lake the topography was pushed from Bayou Coushon (Sketch No. 28) westward to Bayou Le Bar, or two miles and a half to the westward of the Jefferson railroad wharf; and from the water-line southward to the Gentilly Ridge, which follows the south<'lrn l',hore at a distance of from two to two and a half miles. The dense cypress swamp, broken by small passages, which lies between the ridge and the lake con11titutes the main topographical feature of the second sheet·. Within its limits a.re also i~cluded the Pontchar-

W. \V. Harding. The plane table work was commenced on the 25th of January. For the i;ervice and transportation connected with it, the party used the schooner G. M. Bache: This survey joins with the wei:itern limit of work executed laBt year by Sub-AsBistant W. S. Gilbert. A short period at the outset of the present surveying ·;eason was employed by Mr. Seaton at the eastern entrance of the Rigolets, in duty, which will be referred to again in this chapter. At intervals, in the course of the summer, while employed in topography on the coai;t of Texas, Sub-Assistant Gilbert inked the sheet containing Lis field-work of the previous year on the shores of Lake Pontchartrain, and forwarded it to the office. llr. Seaton's plane-table sheet of the north shore of the lake has also been received. Topographyef Passe a Loutre, (Mississippi delta,) La.-The large sheet worked on last season by Assistant F. H. Gerdes, aud intended to embrace the eastern part of the delta to the bead of the passes, was taken up in the latter part of December, and completed in the following February. Its limits (Sketch No. 28) now include the banks of the :Mississippi river, from the north end of the preliminary base to the head of the passes; the banks of Passe a Loutre and North Pass, surve:yed this season; and additional details completing the topography of the Southeast Pass; the shores of Bay Rondo; Robinson's and Parry O'Niel's reefa; and the numerous bays, bayous, and ponds to the north of Passe a Loutre, with the mud flats and islands (some eighty in number) of Blind bay and Donkey bay, which break the land between it and the Southeast Pass. ''The greatest difficulties in the topographical survey were encountered in these two bays, on the shores of which the reeds were so high as to make it impossible to work with the plane-table. To overcome these, high stakes, marked by flags of different colors, were set up along the water-line, and determined in position from the adjacent lighthouses and tripods used in the triangulation." The station-points marked in the preliminary survey of the eastern part of thB delta are reported by Assistant Gerdes as being yet in good order. Sub-Assistant Clarence Fendall assisted in tbe season's work, and inked the topographical sheet, to which was added, by the labors of the part)·, an aggregate of a hundred· and fortytwo miles of shore-line. The area of the whole, embracing the work partially traced in last season, is about a hundred square miles. The schooner .James Hall was in service in prosecuting the survey of the delta. Assistant Gerdes has sent to the office the completed topographical sheet of Passe a Lout.re and vicinity, (Sketch No. 31.) Magnetic observations at the Mis&issippi delta.-Near tlrn triangulation stations marked' 'Cubit'i and "South~ast Pass" onthe progress sketch, (No. 28,) and at a third in the vicinity of the Passe a Lout.re bar, Sub-Assistant J. G. Oltmanns, under the direction of Assistant Gerdes, determined the dip and magnetic intensity, making two sets of observations for each of the elements, and four, in addition, for the intensity, by noting the deflections of the needle. At the first-named station the declination was also ascertained by observations made every five minut~s within a period of two hours, and at PaHse A Loutre at intervah1 of five minutes during

88

REPOHT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

three hours. These observations were made on separate days in December and January. Mr. Oltmanns used the declinometer No. 2, and dip circle No. 8. The collimator No. 6 was used in determiniug the declination, and also for noting .vibrations and deflections; collimator No. 17 being kept suspended during the time employed in observing the deflections. The observations at '' Cubit" were made on the 15th. and those at Southeast Pass on the 21st of December. 'fhe series at Passe a Loutre were taken on the 3d of January. Mr. Oltmanns has furnished for the archives the notes and records made in the several determinations and the field computations of the work. Topography ef Cufe Blanclie bay, La.-Following his own triangulation of this season, Sub. Assistant Oltmanns pm;hed the plane-table work westward from last year's limit at Cote Blanche island (see Sketch No. 28) to the entrance of Vermilion bay, and also along the north shore of Marsh island, from the entrance of that bay, eastward, to Musquito station, completing the survey of the entire shores of Cote Blanche bay. Mr. Oltmanns was aided in this work by Mr. G. U. Mayo, and had the schooner Gerdes in charge, as heretofore, for the transfer of camp fixtures and instruments. All the shores represented on the topographical sheets were found very soft and marshy, except for a short distance on the main or north side of Cate Blanche bay, where the soil was firm and solid . .As already stated, the vessel used, drawing usually six feet, was taken without difficulty quite through the bay to the station on Cote Blanche island. The shore-line run by Sub-Assistant Oltmanns while prnsecuting the triangulation was forty miles. This joint work extended over an area of about seventy square miles, occupying his party during February and March. .At the close of that period the schooner Gerdes was transferred for service in Section VII. The plane-table sbeet of COte Blanche bay (west) Las been inked and filed at the office. Magnetic observalionB at Obie Blanche isla'lld, La.-At a station fifty metres north of the triangulation point on Cate Blanche island (8ketch No. 28) Sub-Assistant Oltmanns determined the magnetic declination on the 3d of March, by observiug, at intervals of five minutes, during six hours. The dip was ascertained by observi11g four sets of observations, and the horizontal intensity determined from two sets of vibrations in connection with four sets of deflections. The instruments used were the declinometer No. 2, and dip circle No. 8. These observations were made while the triangulation and plane-table survey of Cote Blanche bay were in progress. The records and notes connected with them have been filed at the office as usual. Hydrograplzic examination qf Molrile bay and harbar, .Ala.-In pursuance of an arrangement with commissioners acting under authority of the State of Alabama, and by authority of the 'l'reasury Department, a special hydrographic survey has been made of the lower part of Mobile river and of Spanish river, below its junction with the Mobile; as also of the lower part of the Tensaw, and tho entire waters of the harbor in the vicinity of the city of Mobile. The soundings from the head of the harbor were carried to deep water, south of Dog river bar, and from thence a general bydrographic reconnaissance was made through Mobile bay to the Lower Fleet. This resurvey was made by Lieut. Comg. John 'Vilk'mson, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, with a party in the steamer Corwin, between the 4th of May and the 16th of June. His party had been previously employed on the Florida reef. The object of the work was fully set forth in correspondence which passed through the department in March last. Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson conferred personally with the engineer of the commissioners, Captain Leadbetter, and such slight deviations as were deemed advisable were made, in prosecuting the soundings, under the general instructions given to the chief of the hydrograpbic party. The following are the statistics of the work:

In connection with the hydrography, tidal observations were made by the party at St. Francis street wharf, in :Mobile, at the mouth of Chickasaw Layou, and at Great Poiut Clear. 'l'he character of the bottom of the harbor was ascertained by numerous boring,; to the depth of sixteen feet from the surface of the water. Specimens "·ere taken in the same way from the beds of the several rivers before named, and from Dog river bar and along the line ~f deep water to the Lower Fleet. Particular pains were taken in the investigation of the character of the bottom through Choctaw Pa;;s and that of Dog river bar, samples of the materials brought up in each catie Leing preserved and labelled. The land positions necessary for the hydrographic operations were furnished by Assistaut Henry Mitchell, who ~was charged ah.o with special obr,;ervations requi8ite in regard to the tides and currents, which will be more particularly enlarged upon hereafter. 'l'he steamer Corwin returned to New York early in July, aud until the close of ~eptember was employed in connection with hydrographic service in Section I. Sou71dings in the Rigolets, La.-Before taking the field for plane-table duty in January, Sub.Assistant Seaton, with his party in the schooner G. M. Bache, made supplementary snundings at the eastern entrance of the Rigolets, and forwarded to the officP tbe sheet containing them. This, when taken in connection with a sheet executed last year by Sub-Assistant W. S. Gilbert, furnishes material for a map of the entire passage betwco~ Lak~ Borg11e and Lake Pontchartrain, including the approaches of both entrances. The work was concluded on the 19th of January. .A.bout nine hundred casts of the lead were madP by the party of l\Ir. Seaton. Hydrography Qf Ohandeleur sound, La.-Inside of the Ohande1eur islands, and in the upper part of the sound, Lieut. Comg. J. J. Guthrie, U. S. N., Assistant in tlie Coast Survey, joined with the hydrography of a previous year as left by Commander B. F. Sand;,, aud continued the work from the vicinity <;[the Chandeleur light-house, southward, to Pelican key. The hydrography was carried about ten miles to the westward from the line of the islands. This work was executed in May, after the completion of a survey, v;hich will be referred to under the next head. The following statistics are taken from an abstract left at the office by Lieut. Comg. Guthrie just previous to the loss of the steamer Walker off, the coast of New Jersey in June last, by which disaster the journals and details of the work were unfortunately lost: Miles run in sounding · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Angles determined·····. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Number of positions .... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Number of ·soundings ..·. · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·

Hydrography of tlte Mississippi Passes, La.-The survey of the several passes at the eastern side of the Delta was completed in the beginning of May by the hydrographic party in the steamer Walker, in charge of Lieut. Comg. Guthrie. It follows 1he land-work executed by Assist.ant Gerdes, of which notice bas been 1aken in its place in another part of this chapter. The soundings included the approaches and the channels of the north, the northeast, and the southeast pass, and Passe a Loutre, in each of which the hydrography was carried upward to the main body of the Mississippi. This work was commenced on the 22d of March, after the completion of duty by the party in Section VII, (Sketch No. 31.) I have elsewhere referred to the loss of the steamer Walker and the original records by a collision off Absecom, N · .J., while on her passage from Norfolk to New York. A synopsis 12 c

The hydrography of the passes was commenced on the 22d of March. Physical 81ffV('y qf 11fobile bay.-In close connection with the special hydrographic survey of the upper part of l\fobile bay, a limited physical examination of the whole was made under my direction in l\fay last by Assistant Henry Mitchell. This -;vork was done at the expense of the Mobile harbor commission, and comprises observations of the tides and currents taken at certain pointfl, as characteristic of the entire bay for a limited period of the year when considered with reference to the natural causes which, at that season, tend to alter its condition in particular localities. Note;; were at the same time made of the effects of the winds and waves upou tlie channel,; aml shoals. The observations were designed to facilitate the proposed improvement of the water approaches to the city of Mobile, and the results show, in a striking manner, the importance of obtaining data by a systematic survey in advance of such undertakiugs. As an instance, tlrn following remark, taken from the report of Mr. Mitchell, is in point: "The current obBervations which were made at several different depths reveal the nature and power of the scouring forces that maintain the channels. These forces arc found to foUow, in the lower water f'\trata, certain laws often quite at variance with those of superficial movements, showing that conclusions hastily drawn from passing observations upon the surface currents may be entirely fallacious." The cause of the formation of tho hard crust of sand at Choctaw bar was clearly traced, as al:so the nature of the currents of Choctaw Pass, and of those prevailing between Spanish river entrance and the bar. Assis taut Mitchell remarked that the regulal'ly recurring sea-breezes of the summer from the Gulf of Mexico instead of checking the force of the ebbing watei-ri of the rivers, and compelling a deposit of their sediment, simply restrain the surface current. ''The observations were extended several miles beyond the outer bar, and the existence of a coastwiee current, or at least a strong easterly movement, was determined." Fourteen current stations were occupied, and at each of them uninterrupted observations were made at short intervals for an entire tidal day. In most cases the motion of the water was noted at three different depths. While the current observations were going on, the rise and fall of the tide was recorded every half hour at St. Francis street wharf, in Mobile, and during a period of six weeks in all from the commencement of operations. In order to develop the character of the tide-wave in its progress up the bay, simultaneous observations were made for short periods at Fort Morgan, at Great Point Clear, and at Magazine wharf, near Chickasaw Bogue. Assistant Mitchell was aided in this work by Messrs. W. T. Bright and L. M. Johnson. The schooner Gerdes was used in tramiporting the party from station to station. The records in duplicate of observations on the tides and currents have been filed in the office. T·idal observations.-Self-registering tide-gauges were erected in the summer at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi, and at Isle Derniere, and are intended to remain long enough to complete series of observations like those mentioned under the head of Section VII, as having been. taken from St. Mark's to Pensacola at several stations along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. These are now working in charge of Mr. A. C. Mitchell. Day observations have also been made at Passe 8. Loutre.

The observations at the delta are designed to be used in compa1·iso11 with those made in the eastern Hide of the Gulf for developing, if practicable, the general features of the law which governs the tides of the Gulf; or at least for classifying their anomalies. The observers employed in this and in tl1e preceding i,;edion are Messrs. P. H. Donegan, G. W. Maslin, C. Keyser, D. M. Hodges, W. Logan, and G. A. Floyd. SECTION IX.

Of? LOUISIANA

The triangulation in this section has made a great leap forwar<l, covering Corpus Christi and Nueces bays. A second triangulation party has been detailed to work eastward from Galveston during the coming season. The topography keep;;; within a season of tl:e triangulation. The hydrography outside has Jagged, and a great effort is required to bring it up to time, which will be made, if practicable, in the course of next year. The operations of the three parties comprise the following work : 1. The triangulation of Corpus Christi and Nueces bays, and an extension coai"twise of the triangulation from Aransas Pass southward to Laguna del Madre. 2. A plane-table survey of the coast of Texa;;;, including St. Joseph's island and the adjacent parts of Matagorda and Mustang islands. This work completes the topograph~- of San Antonio bay, and embraces tho ,;horcs of J\lusquit and St. Charles' bays, with parts of the shores and the shell reefa and islands of Aransas bay. 3. The extension of soundings inside of :Matagorda bay, from the entrance northward and eastward to Palacios Point, and northward to the entrances of Trespalaeios, Caranckaway, and Lavaca bays. Ojfice-work.-Progress has been made in drawing and engraving coast map and chart No. 108, Matagorda and Lavaca. bays. The drawing of general coast chart No. XVI, Gulf coast, from Galveston bay io the Rio Grande, and that of coast map and chart No. 109, from Mata· gorda bay to Aransas bay, has been continued, and additions have been made to the progress sketch. Triangulation qf Corpus Oltri8li bay, Texas.-This work connects with the triangulation of the coast of Texas, which has been pushed r:outhward and westward from Matagorda by Assistant S. A. Gilbert. His party took the field in .January and resumed operations at Aransas light-house. From the line joining that station (Sk~tch No. 32) with station "Shell Bank," in the lower part of Aransas bay, the triangulation was continued southward to the head of Laguna lfadre, and westward so as to include the entire shores of Corpus Christi bay. In the same direction signals were erected along the shores of Nueces bay, and several of the stations necessary for embracing it in the triangulation were occupied with the tJ1eodolite. The chain of smaller triangles is laid out to extend to the head of the bay. J\fe<isured along the sides of the triangles which rest on Mustang island and Padre island, the advance made in the work coastwise is rather more than twenty-five miles. The early part of the season on this reach of the coast of Texas was marked by prevailing fogs, brought by easterly and southerly winds, and, contrary to his past experience on the Gulf coast, Mr. Gilbert found that these were not dispersed by the northers, but that the atmosphere was left by them hazy and tremulous to an unusual degree. The unfavorable period was employed by the party in visiting and securing stat.ions already occupied, and in erecting signals for carrying tile triangulation forward. Before leaving the section, a general reconnaissance was made in the upper part of the Laguna Madre to determine the best means for continuing the work below Corpus Christi.

Mr. Gilbert'R remarks on the character of the shores of Corpus Christi bay, in continuation of hiR general description, given in my last annual report of the coast between it and Matagorda entrance, will be fouud in the Appendix, (No. 34.) The records and field computations connected with the triangulation work of the present year have been received at the office. Topograpl1y qf San Antonio, Mwsquit, and Aransas bays, Texas.-The survey taken up by Suh-Assistant W. S. Gilbert, at Webb's Point, (Sketch No. 32,) and carried southward along the western shore, completes the topography of San Antonio bay. In connection with this, the lower part of Matagorda island was surveyed, and the plane-table work pushed southward and westward quite through the broken passages and reefs lying betwP.en San Antonio and Aransas bays. Por the purpose of k0eping pace on the outer coast while he was at work on the main land, Mr. Gilbert divided his force, and the survey of St . .Joseph's island was assigned to Mr. T. C. Bowie, the aid of the party. That duty was prosecuted steadily and completed, Mr. Gilbert meanwhile proceeding westward with a separate plane-table in the survey of the shores of St. Chtll'les' bay. 'l'he detailed work in that direction was carried several miles westward of Lamar, and the preliminary work continued to embrace part of the shore-line of Capano bay. Live Oak Point was Rurveyed, as also Lap reef and all the shell banks and reefs of Aransas bay. The two divisions of tlie party were again joined at a station near the lower end of St. Joseph's i;;land, and the topography of the outer coast was extended southward and westward acro,;11 Aran8as Pass, i11cluding, in its course, two miles of the upper part of Mustang island. From tlie light-house at Aransfls Pass, the southern shore of Aransas bay was traced to the Shell Banh, the position of which is marked on the progress sketch. The party took the field on the 5th of January. Mr. Bowie remained in the section until the ht of April. and then, at the direction of Sub-Assistant Gilbert, returned to the office and inked his completed plane-table sheet. With a small number of hands, Mr. Gilbert continued the topographical survey until the 14th of July. An extent of about twenty-seven miles of Gulf co>ist is represented on the sheets.

SECTION X.
FROM SAN DIEGO, OR THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY ON THE PACIFIC, TO THE FORTY-SEXJND PARALJ,EL, INCLUDING THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA.-(8KETCH J, Nos. 33 a.ad 34 )

The usual parties, under the same chiefs, have been occupied in this section in tbe following work: 1. The completion to Santa Barbara of the main triangulation on the shore of Santa Barbara channel, and the triangulation of Santa Rosa and San Clemente islands. 2. Astronomical observations at Ross Mountain, Cal. 1 in connection with the work of main and secondary triangulation. These operations complete the preliminary work between San Francisco bay and the mouth of Russian river. 3. The completion of plane-table work on the shores of Drake's bay, Cal., and topography of Petaluma creek, for the chart of San Pablo bay. 4. Hydrography at the mouth of Salinas river. A. re-survey of the Oakland bar and examinations at the mouth of Sacramento river. The coast hydrography has been extended northward from Duxbury reef, and now includes Drake's bay and Lagoon and Tamales bay. Petaluma creek has been sounded out. 5. Tidal observations. The beautiful charts of San Francisco and San Pablo bays arc the results, in part, of the seasons' s labor in the office. Ojfice-work.-Preliminary charts of San Pedro h~rbor and Crescent City harbor have been drawn and engraved, and the engraving of the charts of San Francisco bay and Humboldt bay; that of the topography of San Pablo bay, and of the additions to Alden's reconnaissance has beeu completed. Additions have been made to the progress sketches, and the drawing of a coast map and chart to include San Francisco bay and harbor has been continued. Triangukdion of the Santa Barbara channel and islands, Cal.-At the most favorable period of the winter of 1859-' 60, Assistant W. E. Greenwell occupied Saddle mountain, situated a.bout eleven miles northeast of Point Duma, as a station in the main triangulation wl1ich passes northward and westward (Sketch No. 33) along the shore of the Santa Barbara channel. Before commencing his observations the four primary stations connected with Saddle mountain were visited, and the requisite signals were set up. The angles were measured with the eightinch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 44. This duty actively engaged the party between December 17 and the 21st of the foJlowing February. Mr. G1·eenwel1 then returned to San Francie:co, the frequent interruptions by rain and protraction of labor by the difficulty of access to the station on Saddle Mountain, having well advanced towards a close the only part of the season which permits observations to be made on the longer lines of the triangulation of this part ·of

the coast of California. On the 1st of .May he transferred his party in the schooner Humboldt to Santa Rosa islaud. Near its northern extremity a base line was measured with wooden bars cut to the length of eight metres and supported by trestles. The distance between the ends of the line, as determined in this way, was 1277.26 metres. Having completed the preliminaries, Assistant Greenwell at once laid out and measured a chain of triangles which includes the entire s110re of the island, (Sketch No. 33,) excepting a few miles along its southern side. 'l'he points now d'"termined are quite imfficient for the plane-table survey. Mr. Greenwell then took up the trim1gulation of San Clemente island. Near the north end of it a site suitable for a short preliminary base was found and a length of 807.92 metres, measured by the means just referred to. In connection with the line a triangulation was carried southward to a point about midway between the two extremities of the island. 'I'he work was continued on San Clemente until the end of Augllst, and its further progress for the season being then stopped b:· a settled fog, the party sailed for Ranta Barbara.

The character of the two islands over which the work was extended has been given in my previous annual reports. Both are destitute of timber, a condition which made the labor of carrying signals to all the stations observed on a matter of grnat difficulty. Each of the islands, moreover, has only three anchorages. Those at Santa Rosa are near its eastern side and not far apart. Two of the anchorages of San Clemente are very near to its northern extremity, and the third is at its extreme southern end. Assistant Greenwell states that during last fall eight thousand head of cattle wore transported from Santa Rosa island to the main, ]caving still some five thousand head on it. He estimates that the pasturage woald sustain from fifty to eighty thousand. It is particularly well adapted to the raising of sheep. Water is abundant at all seasons on Santa Rosa, and is also found in summer on the southeast end of San Clemente, being there the product of the copious rains of the precor1ing winter collected in large basins. All the primary stations ·were visited by Mr. Greenwell and secured against disturbance from natural causes. He has turned in all the records and note-books connected with the triangulation in tl1e vicinity of the San Pedro base and with that on the islands Santa Cruz, San Nicolas, and San l\liguel. Astronomical observations.-On the night of the 26th of March, Assistant George Davidson suc~esi:;fully observed seven occultations of the Pleiades by the dark limb of the moon, at the primary station, Ross mountain, 11ear Russian river, Cal. Full preparation was made for observing the occultations of the same group on the 13th of July, but without success, on account of the low altitude of the moon. Before leaving Ross mountain, Mr. Davidson, in conjunction with his aid, Mr. Fauntleroy, also observed reciprocal zenith distances between that station and Bodega Head, (see Sketch No. 34,) for the purpose of determining the co-efficient of refraction for that part of the coast of California. These observations were made at every hour of the day selected for them, and from 1 o'clock in the morning until 5 o'clock in the afternoon, with the vertical circles Nos. 28 and 80, the latter being spared for use by Sub-Assistant J. 8. Lawson. Two barometers were kindly loaned by Lieut. R. S. Williamson, of the Topographical Engineers. The heigh~ of the station, "Bodega Head," was determined by levelling to connect with the observations, the levels being referred to the station-mark on the Head ai1d also to the bench-mark of the l1ydrographic party at the beach as well as to another established by

THE UNITED ST.ATES COAST SURVEY.

95

Assistant Davidson. ''The bluff above this bench-mark is _about eighty feet high, nearly perpendicular, very much broken, and covered with chapparal, but in levelling, long back, and fore sights were used along the face of the blnff." In the course of the season the height of Ross Mountain station will also be ascertained by a line of levels. At the primary station on Sonoma mountain, north of San Francisco, Mr, Davidson observed the phases of the solar eclipse of the 18th of July, using the zenith tele::;cope Xo. 3. In this service, as also in the preliminaries for observing the Pleiades oceultations and in magnetic determinations, which will be again roforred to, he had the voluntary and intelligent assistance of Henry B. Hubbard, csq., of Cambridge, Mass. The observations for latitude at Ross mountain were made chiefly by :M:r..A.. T. Mosman, the aid, with the zenith telescope No. 3, and in the absence of Assistant Davidson, in consequence of a hurt received at that station. Mr. E. H. Fauntleroy also assisted in them and in determining the azimuth, and the two aids, in conjunction, completed the transit observations for time. These and others at Sonoma mountain and Bodega were made with transit No. 7. Mr. :Mosman was detached from the party at the end of March. For the azimuth at Ross mountain a result was obtained with a probable error of ± 0. 11 2 in thirty-four sets of six observations each, made on seven nights with the C. S. theodolite ~o. 37. The azimuth was also determined at the primary station on Sonoma mountain and for the secondary work at Bodega station, the same instruments being used at both. In all, two hun- dred and four observations were recorded for azimuth, and tvrn hundred and thirty-eight with the transit, exclusive of fifty-four with a sextant for time. The latitude was determined by four hundred and twenty-five observations of forty-one pairs of stars, and the value of the micrometer by one hundred and eighty-six readings. For the coefficient of refraction thirteen hundred and eighty observations were made, and eight hundred and fifty-one readings of the barometer and thermometers recorded. The value of the level scale divisions was ascertained from ninety·six observations. Mr. Davidson makes the following remarks in regard to the character of the atmosphere at Sulphur Peak, one of the primary stations occupied by his party last. year: '' 'Vith the zenith telescope I have observed for latitude stars below the eighth magnitude with a small magni· fying power and with a diagonal eye piece. The air at that height (3, 50() feet) is very clear in summer and remarkably dry, as seen by the shrinking and "Splitting of boxes that have been many years in use. The last-mentioned condition is evidenced also by differences of twenty to twenty-four degrees between the dry and wet bulb thermometers. Frequently at night while a gale from E.NE. (true) was blowing at the station it would be calm below, (,r the wind drawing to the north up Russian River valley. .A.t the same time a thick fog would prevail on the coast to the height of thirteen or fourteen hundred feet, while the wind there was blowing fresh from W.NW. or NW." "The winter season proved very unfavorable for rapid work and for moving. During the first eight days of January rain fell to the depth of twelve inches and a half at Ross mountain, and in the end of March and beginning of April nine inches and a half fell in eight days. In the valleys the amount was much less.'' All the computations and reductions connected with the astronomical work and triangulation and magnetic observations to be yet noticed were kept up as the determinations wer·e made, and these, with the original records, makiug a total of sixty-six volumes, were forwarded to the office by Assistant Davidson. The extended astronomical observations were made by him personally, and his stations of previous years have been joined with the triangulation. Primary and seoondary triangula.tfon rwrtk of San Francisco bay, Oal.-.A.t the date of my last annual report a reconnaissance was in progress, under the direction of Assistant Davidson, for extending the primary triangulation on the coast of California northward of Russian river; and

at that time only the station on Ross mountain remained to be occupied to bring the main work complete up the river jast named. Mr. Davidson remained at Sulphur Peak, (see Sketch No. 34,) while 11is aid><, Messrs ..l<J. H. Fauntleroy and A. T. Mosman, were employed about thirty-five miles to the northward in establishing two stations to connect with it and with Ross mountain. Both of the stations selected by them are shown on the progress sketch. The observations on the new signals were at once completed at Sulphur Peak, and with greater difficulty the angular measurements required on them at Ross mountain. Here Mr. Davidson was severely injured while engaged with his party in getting up a signal pole to the station", from a gulch near bis camp, and was compelled to return to Sau Franci>'co. The measuremPnt of horizontal angles and other operations were prosecuted in his absence by the aids of the party. At Sulphur Peak vertical angles were measured on two objects, at Bodega station on eleven, and at Ross mountain on fifteen, with the vertical circle, C. S. No. 28. The height of Mount Helena was incidentally determined from that station, and an altitude found from the preliminary calculations of 4, 343 feet above the ocean level. In the course of hi::i Teconnaissance northward of Ross mountain Mr. Fauntleroy traced the shore-line between Russian ri,~er and Walalla mountain, and furnished a sketch to the office, with a report on the reconnaissance. He also posted the heliotropers required for the primary work. While moving from Ross mountain to the mouth of the river above named Mr. Davidson found much difficulty in transporting his instruments over the intervening ridges, which are entirely imprncticable for teams. He acknowledges valuable assistance rendered to him in so doing, and to the party while at Ro8s mountain by Mr. John H. Chenowith. Mr. Fauntleroy died suddenly at San Francisco on the 25th of May, in the midst of a career which promised much usefuh1ess to the survey. He had served with Assistant Davidson since his last return to the western coast in 1858, and had acquired much experience in the variety of duties required in traversing a country so devoid of facilities for personal comfort or for travel as the region over which he had been actively engaged. After being detained in San Francisco two months by hi' injuries, Mr. Davidson rejoined his party on the 4th of June, and under hiB direction .Mr. Horace .Anderson, who bad been detailed as aid, erected the signals for a tertiary triangulation between Tomales bay and Salmon ~;reek, to include Bodega bay, (Sketch No. 34.) The reconnaissance for this work had been made, and signals necessary for the secondary and tertiary series of triangles, to embrace the coast north of it to Russian river, were set up by Mr. Mosman previous to his departure for Section XL Mr. J. M. Gilliss joined the party at the end of February, and after a period of absence on special duty in Washington 'l'erritory returned to it on the 1st of August.

He remarks, in reference to the means employed for securing accuracy _in the primary work, that the results show a mean probable error of only±0."20, and tliat m some cases the pr.:>bable error in the angulat' measurements is only ±()."15. All the records and computations connected with the triangulation have been turned in and filed at the office.

Magnetic observations.-In connection with the work of secondary triangulation at Bodega, a magnetic station was occupied by Assistant Davidson, and the aLsolutc magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were determined, as also the values of the inBtrumental scales. Some observations were undertaken to determine the coefficient of temperature for the deflecting magnet, but the freezing mixture provided for the purpm;c prove(l to lie deficient. The magnetic declination was observed abo at Ross mountain. At these two stations five hundred and fifty-one observations in all were made with the theoclolite magnetometer No. 3 and dip circle No. 5. Topography of Santa Crvz -island, Cal.-The survey of this island, which is one of the Santa Barbara group, was resumed by Sub-Assistant W. M. Johm;ou at the opeuiug of tl1e working season, and continued until the &th of September. Tlw statistics of tlie work dolle haYe not yet reached the office. Towards the end of September the party of Mr. Johnson was transferred to Half Moon bay in the steamer ActiYc, and the plane-table \York i8 now in progress there to fill a gap in the survey of the coast between San Francisco eutrance and :M.:mterey bay. Topography Qf Petaluma creel~, Gal. -The plane-table survey of this "tribut:uy of San Pablo bay was commenced by 1'.lssistant A.. F. Rodgers on the 28th of June. Two sheets were projected for it-one to contain the topography of the upper part of the creek, including the town of Petaluma; and the other the riaturnl features along the banks from Lakeville to it,,; eutrauce into San Pablo bay. Mr. Rodgers worked on tho upper sheet, and by the 10th of Septemlier completed all the requisite details. The lower sheet was assigned to :Mr. David Kerr, tlie aid in the plane-table party. Both are uow filled, and will be inked in the cour,;e of the comiug winter. Their limits are shown on Sketch No. 34. The survey of Petaluma creek is based on the triangulation made by .Assistant G.

Tracings of the shore-line contained on them were furnished for the use of the hydrog;aphic party of Commander Alden. ·The t:oast above Duxlmry reef presented great obstacles to progress, being mountainous in its clmractcr, and broken by sharp ridges and deep intervening ravines . .,bsistant Rodgers is now at work on the shores of Tamales bay, ahove Point Reyes. Hudrograpl1y.-ln the courne of the season the party of Commander James Alden, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, executed the following surveys in this section with the steamer Active .. The localities of work will Le referred to in geographical order. The mouth of the Salinas' river (Monterey bay) wa:s sounded out between the 1st and 15th of May. Tl.rn hydrography of tlie entrance and approaches of San Francisco bay was extended, and finally completed at intervali:; during the present year. At the special request of commissioners having in charge the improvemen,t of navigation in the entrance of San A.ntonio creek, Commander Alden made a careful re-examination of the Oakland bar, and sounded out the entrance minutely in the latter part of May. A. tide-gauge was set up for the reduction of soundings, and observations made for determining the character of the currents in connection with them. Petaluma creek, (San Pablo Lay,) from its entrance upwards to the town of Petalum:i, was sounded before the close of the season by the party in the A.ctive. Before leaving the bay hydrographic examinations ·were made by soundings on the "Tongue shoal," and at "Hog's Back," near the mouth of Sacramento river. Resuming the coast hydrography north of San Francisco entrance, the in-shore soundings were extended to Point Reyes, including Drake's bay and lagoon, (Sketch No. 35,) and from Point Reyes carried northward to the entrance, and then quite through Tomales bay. The severnl localities mentioned will be recognized by Sketch No. 34.

Two original sheets, containing the soundings made in the harbor of San Pedro and its approaches, and the survey of Humboldt bay, have been received from Commander Alden since the opening of the year. The work at both of these localities was completed last season. Commander .A.Iden was detached from duty in the Coast Survey at his own request early in Octolrnr, and will be succeeded by Lieut. Comg. D. D. Porter, U. S. N. Tidal observatfons.-Under an arrangement made several years ago satisfactory to the chief of the Engineer Bureau, and by which the services of Lieut. G. H. Elliot, of that corps, became available for the general su1,ervision of the observations on the Western Coast., the self-registering tide-gauges at San Diego and San Francisco have been kept in operation during the surveying year. A temporary station was established at Cape San Lucas, and a series obtained which, though defective, will serve for general purposes of comparison with the results found at the two permanent stations. The records from the gauges kept at San Diego and San Francisco arc highly creditable to the observers, Mr . .A.. Cassidy and Mr. H. E. Uhrlandt.

The following work has been executed in this section since the date of my last annual report: 1. The measurement of a preliminary base and triangulation of Gray's harl)or, -w. T. 2. Progress in the triangulation of the Gulf of Georgia, W. T., including the memmrement of the preliminary base on Sandy Point. 3. The eclipse of July 18 was observed at a stat.ion near Bteifocoom. 4. A. reconnaissance with soundings at the mouth of the Coquille river, Oregon. 5. Tidal observations. Qffece-work.-Additions have been made in drawing and engraving to Alden's reconnaissance of the Western Coast, (upper sheet,) and to the progress sketch, and the drawing has been completed for a new edition of the preliminary chart of 'Vashington sound. Progress has also been made in the drawing of a general map and chart to include that sound. Triangulation ef Gray's liarbor, W. T.-The party of Sub-A.ssistant J. S. La\\son reached the entrance of Gray's harbor on the 23d of April in the bri~ Fauntleroy, and without delay made preliminary arrangements for the triangulation. Mr. Lawson selected a site on the north· ern side of the entrance, and theu measured. a preliminary base, finding for its approximate length 1, 7 45 metres. Proceeding from that vicinity, a triangulation was laid out and measured, to include the entire bay, as well its expansions north and south of the entrance as the body of it setting up northward and eastward to the mouth of Chehalis ri.,.er. During part of the season Sub-Assi;:;tant Lawson was aided in this duty by Mr. A. T. Mosman, who joined his party near the end of March, and after a short absence in July returned to it again when relieved from special duty in the northern part of the section. The plan of the triangulation of Gray's harbor is shown on Sketch No. 36. Mr. Lawson secured the ends of the base line temporarily with wooden blocks, pieces of stone of durable kind not being procurable on the shores of the harbor. The lino will be remeasured before the ends are marked in the usual way, and observations will be made to determine the latitude and azimuth of the lines of the triangulation. As the work progressed signals were determined in posltion for the hydrography, but in consequence of the detention of the steamer Active in Section X, and the detachment before the close of the season of the officer in command, the soundings have not yet been taken up. As already stated, an officer bas been detailed to succeed Commander Alden in tl:.e charge of the hydrographic party. and the work for which provision has been made will be included in the operations of the coming year. Lieut. Comg. D. D. Porter, U. S. N., is now completing arrangements for taking command of the steamer Active. Si!b-Assistant Lawson reported the completion of the preliminary work on the 1st of September, with the following synopsis of statistics: Signals erected ...........·..·........................... · · · · · · · · Stations occupied ..·................................ · - · · · · · · · · · · · Angles measured .......·.....·.......·............. · · · · · - · · · · · · · Objects observed on ...·..·..·.·................. · · . · · · - · · · · · · · · · Number of observations ....................... · · · - · · · - · - · · · · · · · · · 36 22 194 154 G, 018

For the determination of hydrographic and shore-line points four hundred and twenty-eight single readings were taken in addition on secondary signals. The field computations were kept up regularly as the work advanced, and as soon as practicable Mr. I~a.wson plotted the points of the triangulation and traced in the shore-line of the harbor.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Mr. .Alexander Agnssiz, who was attached to the party as aid at the outset of the working season, resigned ou the 1st of March. Snh·Assistant Lawson states that while lying off the ent.rance of the harbor in the Fauntleroy a northerlY current of at least a knot and a half the hour was distinctly perceptible. His general re~rnrks in regard to the character of Gn1y' s harbor are contained in the following extracts from hif' report on the triangulation: ''Tho Fauntleroy cros8ed the bar on the last quarter of the ebb in two and a half fathoms, but I nm not certain that we vvere in the deepest water. * * * * '' Grny' s harbor is very much taken up by sand and mud flats which are bare at low water, and have between them very contracted channels. The effect of these flats was greatly to retard the progress of the triangulation by impeding our movements. In l'lome places they are so extensi,·e and the mud so soft that the stations could be reached 0111y at high water. The whole of the North bay is an extended mud fiat somewhat cut up by channels that mark the courses of a few small stream:; emptying into this part of the harbor. In neither of these is there sufficient water io float a whale-boat." "Our first anchorage, in three fathoms and a quarter, at a pmiition north of Point Hanson, though pointed out to us as the best, proved to be otherwise. From the end of the growth of trees on Point Brown there is no defence whatever to the force of winds from the northwest and west, and these are the summer trade-winds of this part of the Pacific coast. As these winds at times blow very strong, with the rapid currents of the harbor, a heavy sea is the con· sequence, making that anchorage not only uncomfortable, but actually unsafe. Independent of this, there is another feature of the place wl1ich 1enders it dangerous as an anchorage. In the entrance of the liarbor there is a middle ground wbjch jg bare at low water. Until the tide rises sufficiently to cover this hank the current sets regularly in the direction of the channel, but then commences a heavy overfall, causing a rip or bore, e,;pecially on the large tides, and strong enough to tear vessels from their anchors. This effect happened to our vessel on the night of the 4th of May, and other vessels have met with the same mishap. * * * * "I com·ider the South bay as the only safe anchorage near the entrance of the harbor." ''The cun:ory examination made during the progress of the triangulation inclines me to think that the hydrographic survey will develop many changes that have taken place in the chamrnls since they were first examined. The south channel is impracticable for vessels of any draught, except at high water. There seems to be a middle channel leading into the harbor, but we were unable to determine its capacjty." "For vessels going to the head of Gray's harbor or into the Chehalis river the north channel is the only one to be used. It is very narrow in some places, and to be made available should be buoyed out in its entire length.'' The original record of horizontal angles me:>"sured by Mr. Lawson at Crescent City harbor, iu the lower section of the Western Coast, has been received at the office. Triangulal'ion q( the Gulf of Georgia, W. T.-Sub-Assistant Lawson was still at work ift the Gulf of Georgia at the date of my last annual report; and before leaving that vicinity he measured, in addition to the progress then reported in statistics, thirteen angles, using seven additional signals. He also traced about fifteen miles of the shore-line adjacent to his triangulation of the Gulf of Georgia. 1lfewsnrement [!f a preli"minary base at Sandy Point, r;r: T.-After closing the triangulation work of the seat1on in November of last year Suh-Assistant Lawson proceeded to Sandy Point, a narrow neck which projects southward from the main laud of Washington Territory, towards tbe. no.rtb end of Lummi island, (Sketch No. 3G,) and measured a base of 1, 181.16 metres. This lme connect!:! with the triangulation of the Gulf of Georgia. The measurement was made with the improved apparatus described in .Appendix No. 45 of my annual report for 1857. As reported by Mr. Lawson, the site of the base on Sandy Point is not well adapted for great

101

accuracy in the determination of its length, part of it running over unstal>le marsh. In other respects it is devoid of the difficulties that present themselves on the numerous islands lying more nearly central in the triangulation. Soon after his return to San Francisco last winter, :Mr. Lawson sent to the office the originals and most of tho duplicates of the journals kept in the field operations of 1858-' 59. These are contained in twenty-eight volumes, and comprise the record" of horizontal and vertical angles, de;;eriptions of the stations as marked for future reference, and 110tes of the measurement of the preliminary base at Sandy Point. He has furnished also the field computation derived from the measurements for horizontal angles. The party in the Fauntleroy is now about to proceed northward and take up the plane-table survey of San Juan island, in Washington sound . .A.~lrorwmical observations.-With the concurrence of the Hon. Secretary of the Navy. the services of Lieut. J. M. Gilliss, U. S. N ., were tendered to the Coast Survey in May last, for the special object of observing 'the solar eclipse of the 18th of July, for longitude purposes. His kind offer having been at once accepted, preliminary arrangements were made at the Coast Survey office, and the requisite aids and instrumentl:l were placed at his disposal, with instructions to proceed to Washington Territory, and to choose a station as nearly as practicable on the line of the central eclipse. Lieut. Gilli;;s reached Seattle on the 22d of June, and after a general reconnai:;;sance of t.liat vicinity, and inquiry in regard to others, with a view of procuring the most eligible site for his observations, seleded a knoll on M:nck prairie, ahont ten miles S.SE. from Fort Steilacoom. The determinatiom; for tin-ie and latitude, with other observations, were successfully made, and the results, as well as the gcnernJ particulars connected with them, are given in the report of Lieut. Gilliss, which will be found in the Appendix No. 22. Mr. A. 'l'. :Mosman detailed from the party of Sub·Assistant Lawson, and Mr. James Gilliss, from the party of Assistant Davidson, served as aids for this special duty. Hydrographic reconna.issance q/ Coquille River entrance, Oregon.-Near the close of the last surveying year Commander .Alden detailed a party from the steamer Active to proceed, in charge of Lieut. Jno. G. Mitchell, and make an examination and survey, if practicable, of the Coquille river entrance. The party measured a preliminary base, determined the requisite signals, and traced the shores for some distance, but the fogs and rain prevalent in November prevented the use of the signals for laying down the soundings. Lieut. Mitchell reported that the middle of the channel, for a distance of two miles from Hie mouth of the river, gave depths varying between twelve and twenty-two feet. A party from the Active is now engaged in a' second examination of the mouth of the Coquille, with a good prospect for success. Previous to his detachment from the command of the hydrographic party on the Western Coast, at his own request in October last, Commander Alden sent to the office a Bheet contaiu· ing the hydrography of the entrance to Haro and Rosario straits, and the sheet of soumlings made at the close of last season in the Gulf of Georgia. Tidal obscrvatfons.-One of the self-registering gauges in the general charge of I .. ieut. G. II. Elliot, U. S. Engineers, as stated under the head of Section X, has been kept in excellent working order by Mr. Louis Wilson, and the year's series obtained from it is very satisfactory. Offece-work.-The Coast Survey office has continued, during the past year, to be in charge of Captain W. R. Palmer, U. S. Topographical Engineers, the effect of whose experience and careful administration may be traced in all its divisions. Lieutenant A. P. Hill, U. S. A., has acted as general assistant. During occasiOnal absences of Capt. Palmer, Lieut. Hill Las been in temporary charge of the office, and has shown his usual decided efficiency. The report of Captain Palmer (Appendix No. 19) is followed by those of the chiefs of the sev~ral divisions of the office, viz : l. T lte Hydrograpltic Division; 2. The Computing; 3. The Tidal.: 4. The Drawing/ 5. The Engraving; G. Tlw Photographing awl Electrotyping,- 7. TJw

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDEXT OF

Miscellaneovs Division. The details show minutely the occupation of each person, and the progress resulting from their joint labors. The improvements made i_:nd making are of a striking character, and are carefully stated. Captain Palmer, Lieutenant Wilson, and Mr. Mathiot give interesting statements of the application of photography, which has now been sntematized in its minutest details. " 'l'he general occupation in the different divisions has been as follows: Hydrograpkic Division.-Under Commander S. S. Lee and Lieut. Silas Bent, U. S. N., important revisions have been made of hydrographic work and of the charts resulting from it, · original aR we11 as reduced, sailing directions, dangers, &c., &c. JJJr. A. Balbach has been attached to the division as draughtsman, and has executed the details under the direction of Lieut. Bent. These include the verification of orginal sheets, the revision of engraved sheets, the plotting of sailing lines and current stations, and the correction of positiom; of buoys, light-vessels, &c. ll'Ir. L. Karcller has been employed since April in making projections for the hydrographic parties, and in replotting preliminary hy"drographic work. ll'Ir. W. B . .JJic.ll1nrtrie has made projections and views for chart;;, and part of the season was employed in revising sheets of special localities. Messrs. W. S. Simpson and Orton Williams have been assigned to the division for practice in hydrographic drawing in advance of taking duty with the parties afloat. Computing Division.-Assistant C. A. Schott has been in charge as heretofore, and has fully maintained the efficiency required in this important branch of the office. He took the :field in August and September, and determined the magnetic elements at several stations on the coast, and has, in addition to his general duties, contributed for this report several papers of interest, copies of which will be found in the Appendix, (Nos. 25, 28, 29, 36, 37, and 38.) Of the computers attached to the office, Assistant T. W. Werner has been engaged in the reduction of triangulations and azimuths; Mr. E. Nulty on reductions of azimuths and latitudes, and Mr. J. Main in the revision_of various astronomical computations, and in reducing magnetic observations. He also had charge of the di vision during Mr. Schott' s temporary absence on field duty. Mr. G. Rumpf has been engaged in the revision of geodetic computations, and in aqjusting triangulations by the method of least squares. Mr. .J. Wfassner was reassigned to duty in August last, and has since been employed jn adjusting triangulations and in miscellaneous computing. Mr. W. D. Storke was, for several months, on field duty, and while connected with the division made reductions of triangulation work. Mr. B. H. Todd has been engaged in various astronomical and geodetic computations, and assisted in reducing results from the larger triangulations. Mr. J. T. Hoover acted as clerk to the division in the early part of the year, and also assisted in preparing lists of geographical positions. He is replaced by Mr. J. H. Patton, who has since performed the clerical duty and aided in special observations. Assistant A. S. Wadsworth and Sub-Assistant 0. Fendall were temporarily attached to the division after their return from field-service at the south. Mr. H. Ledyard was attached for a short period 1md engaged in clerical duty. Tidal Divi.~on.-The labors of this division, which have been, as heretofore, conducted by Assistant L. F. Pourtales, are stated in the Appendix before referred to. Mr. Pourtales has continued, incidentally, the inyestigation of specimens of soundings, and ha8 mado developments of much intereRt in this branch of research. Tbe force of the division has been employed as follows: Mr. R. S . .A.very on discussions relative to the application of formulre, and1 during occasional absences of Mr. Pourtales, be 11.as been in ~harge of the division. Mr. J. Downes has continued the graphical decomposi· hons, reductions, and comparisons. Mr. .J. W. Donn is engaged in verifying the records and

corresponds with the observers. Mr. C. Balmain and Mr. J. R. Gilliss have made graphical decompositions, and M. Thomas and S. D. Pendleton have been employed in miscellaneous reductions. Drawing Division.-Lieut. Thomas Wilson, U.S. .A., has continued in charge of this division, and its progress, together with the great assistance which reduction by photography has rendered to it, is fully treated in bis report, (Appendix No. 19.) The distribution of work has been as follows: .A8sistant W. M. C. Faiifax, until within a short period of his lamented decease, which occurred on the 8th of August, and to which reforence has been made in the introduction to my report, was eng.lged upon the most elaborate topographical r1:ducti~ns. Assistant M. J. McClery has also been employed upon work of a similar character, and has filled in topography upon photographed outline. Mr. E. Hcrgeshefrner has assisted in tll() compilation of new instructions for draughtsmen and engravers, and has had charge of the preparation and generalization of sheets intended for the photograph, and the verification of the negatives of the same. Before entering upon these duties he was engaged upon reductiorn~ of topography and hydrography. ll:fr. A. Lindenkoltl on topographical and hydrographical reductions of various scales, projects, projections, verifications, and progress sketches. .J.fr. W. P. Schultz, during the short time he was employed, worked on projects, projections, progress sketches, diagrams, and preliminary charts. Mr. L. D. Williams on fine reductions of topography and hydrography, verifications and projections. He also made additions to tlrn Congress map. JJ:fr · .A. Sirauz has been employed on hydrographic reductions and projections for field parties. Mr. W. T. Martin has worked on topographical drawings, and has filled in topography upon outlimi reduced by photography. Mr. J. J. Ricketts and Jir. L. Karcher, during part of the season, made hydrographic reductions for the smaller scale charts. The former,~during the year, was assigned to duty in the field, and the latter transferred to the Hydrographic Division. Mr. S. B. Linton has made reductions of various kinds, progress sketches, projections, diagrams and tracings, and has executed lettering. Mr. F. Pairjax is employed on preliminary charts, in tracings, and in mi;;cellaneons duties. JJfr. B. llooe on tracings generally, and Mr. 1V. Fairfax and lJir . .A. J. De Zeyk 011 the same during part of the year. Messrs. J. W. Maedal and W. JI. Gardner have made tracings of origiual sheets to be used in photography. Engraving Division.-The duties of this division have been conducted by Li~ut. J. R. Smead, U. S. A., assisted by Mr. Edward 1Vltarton. The distribution of the work to the engravers has differed but little from that of the previous year. Mr. G. 11IcCoy has been engaged upon topography and views for charts; Mr. John Kni'.ght oh first clas;; lettering; Messrs . .A. Ro"llc, J. Enlhojfer, .A. Blondeau, and H. O. Evans on topography; lJiessrs . .A. Sengtdler, W. Phillips, G. B.:Metzcroth, and .A. Maeda], on topography and sand; Mr. H. S. Barnard on sanding; 1II1·. J. C. Koridrup on first class outlines; Mr. J. V. N. Throop, up to the time of his death, upon lettering for harbor charts; Messrs. E . .A. Jiaedcil, W. Ogilvie, A. Petersen, 1V. Langran, and C. T. Klackring upon lettering and figures; Messrs. R. F. Bartle, F. 1V. Benner, and TV. .A. ThomPJon upon topography, sand, and miscellaneous work; Mr. E. H. Sipe upon lettering; and Messrs. M. L. Wells and J. G. Thomp.Yon upon progress sketches and miscellaneous work. Photograpli and Electrotype .Division.-The details of the work done in this branch of the office will be found in the report of Mr. Grorge 11fathiot, (Appendix No. 19,) who is in charge of the division. Mr. Mathiot has continued his labors in photography, and, Ly substituting glass for paper in the reductions, has overcome the effect of hygrometric changes on the paper photograph. The process has been made a regular office method, and the short time that it has been in use has proved its economy both in time and expense. It allows the engraving to go on steadily, each plane-table sheet being reduced separately and the junctions being made on the copper plate. Estimates of the chiefs of the Drawing and Engraving Divisions show that the cost of publication of a chart by this method will be at least one-third less than that.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

by hand reduction. The method is detailed in Mr. Mathiot's report. Three of the most elaborate charts of the survey are now engra,ing from the photographic reductions. The photogra}Jh has been made available iu: several cases for forming projects for charts, the facility with which a drawing can be enlarged or deduced being well adapted for this purpose, as detached sketches ou different scales can be readily combined into one. Mr. Mathiot has had the intelligent assistance of ;.1/r. David Hinkle in the various duties of the division. Jfisccllaneous Division.-Lieul. J. ll. Smead, U. S. A., has, in addition to bis charge of the erigraving, also had the care of this division up to the first of October, when he was relieved , by Lieut ...l{. H. JJicLcan. U. S. A. The various duties classed under this head have been well and actively performed during the past year, and the delicate responsibility of curtailing the number of those who have annuall.r looked forward to the reception of the reports, caused by the diminished number of extra copies ordered by the Congress of 1858-' 59, has been judiciously accomplitihed. The distribution of the printed maps and charts during the year called for over six thousand copies, aud of the annual reports and sketches five thousand and sevcntyseven. The duty of as::;istant in this division has been successively performed by M1·. V. E. King, Mr. T. B. Alexander, 11Ir. C. 0. Callan, and now by lllr. M. Maynadier. ltfr. J. Rutherdale, printer, aided by J.fr. J. Barrett, has printed all the charts and sketches required for office use and for distribution. JJfr . .1.11. . Mertz backs all the paper required for the field parties, and olso devotes a good deal of time to securing from further damage the older and much-used records in the archives. J:fr. J. Vierbuclwn, master machinist, and J.Ir. A. Yeatman, master carpenter, have kept their respective shops up to the standard requisite to meet all the calls made upon them. Commander S. S. Lee has continued to discharge acceptably, and with decided advantage to the survey, the duties of hydrographic inspector, and has attended personally to the fitting out of all the ves8els used in the suryey. Assistant L. F. Pourtales in tidal discussions, Professor W. P. Trowbridge in that of the Gulf Stream, and Assistant C. A. Schott in various questions which came up during the year, have rendered valuable service. The duties of general disbursing agent have been discharged with bis usual care, industry, and faithfulness by Samuel Hein, esq. The principal clerk in the Superintendent's office has, with added experience, continued in the same effective track of duty; and in my service in the field Hugh :McHenry, esq., has been very attentive and industrious. Re~ectfully submitted. .A.. D. BA.CHE, Superinte:niknt U. S. Coast Survey. Hon. PmLJP F. THOMAS, Secretary of the Treasury.

Letter to the Secretary ef the Treasury, communicating particulars rel,ative to the position mid extent ef the Asia Rt'p and Pl1elps' s bank, off Nant-ucket, i11 extracts from tl1e report ef Lieut. Oomg. T. 8. Phelps, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey.
NEW YORK, November 14, 1860. Sm: Information having been received from Messrs. E. & G. W. Blunt, of New York, that her Britannic Majesty's mail steamer Asia, Captain Lott, had, on the 16th of August last, passed through a tide rip to the southward and eastward of Nantucket, upon which a sounding of eleven fathoms was obtained, a surveying vessel, under the command of Lieut. Thomas S. Phelps, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, was despatched to make an examination of the locality. This resulted in finding the shoal reported by Captain Lott, and also·in the discovery of another of much greater extent. I have the honor to communicate, for the general benefit of navigation, the following extracts from Lieut. Comg. Phelps's report: "Near the position given by Captain Lott, of the Asia, is a small, well-defined rip, corresponding with his description, it being about a mile in length and a quarter of a mile in width, with eleven fathoms on the shoal. IIalf a mile to the eastward of this lies the south point of another shoal which extends to the N.KE., six and a half miles, with but ten and ten and a half fathoms of water upon it. in several places. "These shoals are distinctly marked by the rips on both the flood aud ebb tides, hut with deep and smooth water between them. 'l'heir position is between the-

Ossabaw Sound, Ga., May 4, 1860. Sm: The channel outside of Ossabaw sound is narrow, and the entrance leading in is nearly six miles to the southward of it. The entrance can be approached with confidence, as the soundings shoal gradually from eight to three and a quarter fathoms, and that depth can b.e carried in nntil the north point of Ossaba.w island bears west, where the water dE>iepens to six and seven fathoms. Thence on, the water shoals until within one mile and a half of the north point of Ossabaw, nearly abreaat of the" point of bare shoal, where the channel is sudDEAR

denly obstructed by a belt extending inward for nearly two miles, over which but fourteen feet can be carried at 1ow water, to deeper soundings and a safe anchorage off the west point of Raccoon island, clrn>e to, in six and seven fathoms, sticky bottom. The line of shoal water extending from the north point of Ossaba'v islanl to seaward, and to the southward for four miles, on the one hand, and a line of breakers (north breakers) extending from the point of Great Wassaw island eight miles to the southward, on the other, form this channel. There is a slue or swash across tbe north breaker looking directly into the open way of the. sound, through which at least ten feet may be carried. When buoyed out this pa8sage ,v\ll doubtless be much resorted to by coasting steamers and others, that n°'v, for the moRt part, avoid the main entrance because of its distance and indirection. There appears also to be a cLauuel branching off from the main, in the vicinity of the first buoy, at the entrance looking toward Pi11e island, passing around the north side of Raccoon island, and leading into the Y ernou and Little Ogeechee rivers; but until the soundings have been plotted it is quite impossible to form a correct idea of the depth or character of the water in the sound, as the bottom is very irregular and uneven. I shall therefore confine myself to tbe narration of such general features as have presented themselves during the progress of the survey. The soundings have been carried up the rivers as far as the triangulation extends, and have been connected with those executed by the party of Lieut. Comg. 1faffitt. in the Romerly marnh. For a distance of bveuty·five miles up the Great Ogeecbee, as far as the crossing of the Albany and Gulf railroad, there is much traffic carried on in smaU schooners, and this region produces its millions 1vorth of rice and cotton, which finds its way through these inland waters to the Savannah market. It ii:; desirable, therefore, that this river should be sounded out to the chief landing at the point of crossing above mentioned. The bar buoy and the next one in turn (there liaving been originally five buoys in all) haYe not been in place during our sojourn here. The readjustment of them should he deferred until the reduction of our soundings, when the exact positions necessary for their occupations can be indicated. * * * From a comparison with the hydrographic reconnaissance made of the channel-ways of Ossabaw by Captain Mackay, U. S. A., in 1846, it would seem that great changes have since then occurred, and aU for tbe· worse. The seaward face of Ossabaw island has certainly undergone considerable change of feature since that portion of the shore-line embraced in my projection was executed. The triangulation point "north Ossabaw island No. 2" has washed away since the commencement of our survey, and the spot is now marked by a large tripod erected by my party.

hydrography is by Lieut. Comg. Fauntleroy, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coast Survey. Lieutenant Bent makes tlie comparison of the old and new ehannels as follows: "The new channel crosses the bar three-quarters of a mile to the southward of the old one now in u::;e, and has much the appearance as if it was forcing itself through the bar, which at this point is only about one hundred feet in width, and with eighteen feet of water upon its shoalest part, the soundings showing twenty feet on either side, and deepening gradually both to sea mird ·aml ill-shore along the channel coast. There are eighteen feet of water on the bar, but only seventeen feet in the old channel. In the latter the bar is fully a mile in width, and the slightest deviation from the channel course would carry a vessel into sixteen or fifteen feet. Tho new channel, on the contrary, is wide, and the bar being so narrow affords great advantage to vessels of large draught.'' I would respcotfolly request authority to publish the information in reference to this new channel. Y cry respectfully, yours, A. D. BACHE, Superintendent. Hon.

Leiter to the Secretary ef ihe Trea.mry, u-ith extracts from the report of Lieut. Comg. Jolin Wilkinson, U. S. N., As3istant Coast Survey, relative to dangers to navigation on the Fwrida reef, off Long key and Grassy key. Co.A.ST SURVEY OFFICE, July 7, 1860. Sm: I have the honor to transmit, for the information of the Light-house Board, extracts from the report of Lieut. Comg. John Wilkinson, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, with a sketch showing the position of Tennessee shoal, Florida reef, and also the position of a wreck off Grassy key, determined in the course of the season's work of his party in the steamer Corwin. ''A careful examination was made of Tennessee shoal, which is more properly a group of shoals bearing 8. by E. (by compass) from the east end of Long key. The outer and most dangerous one, with only twelve feet of water on it, is upon an elbow of the reef, and so close to the edge of it that vessels bound to the ·westward, and keeping the shoal water close aboard, are in great danger of running upon it, as there is deep water (twenty fathoms) within a cable's length to the southward. Several -vessels are said to have struck there, but it is almost impossible to obtain reliable information where such casualties occur upon this coast. It is certain, however, that the shoal receives its name from a ship that was wrecked there many years ago. As it would be impracticable to mark its place permanently by a beacon, I would respectfully suggest that a buoy with heavy moorings might stand, which would be a great aid to navi· gation through the straits." * * * ''In the course of the season's operations the position of a sunken wreck off Grassy key was determined. It lies in twelve feet water, on the northern edge of the Hawk channel, and bears south, by compass, distant about two miles from the middle of the key. As it is a dangerous obstac1e to navigation, few even of the coasters knowing its exact locality, its position was marked by a pole as well secured as our means would permit.

Craven, U. S. N.
NEW YORK, November 15, 1860. Srn: I have the honor to communicate that having received information from S. Thayer A.bert, esq., civil engineer, Pensacola navy yard, of the existence of a shoal spot in the channel leading into Pensacola bay, Lieut. T · .A.. Craven, U. S. N., commanding the U. S. steamer Mohawk, made an examination of it at my request, and reported tlie following result: "The shoal, which has but 20 feet of water upon it at mean low water, lies SE. from the navy yard, and about midway between the main and Santa Rosa island. ''The following bearings from it determine its position, v1z: Hospital, (magnetic,) NW. ~ N. Church, (magnetic,) N. Chimney, (navy yard,) (magnetic,) NE. by N. Fort McRae, (flag-staff,) (magnetic,) SW. by W. l W. Fort Pickens, " SW. "This shoal is evidently of recent formation, and supposed to have been caused by a sunken tree or log." I would respectfully request authority to publish this as a notice to mariners. Very respectfully, yours,

A. D. BACHE, Sitpenntendent U. S. Coast Survey.

APPENDIX No._ 16.
Tide tables for the use of navigators, prepared from the Coast Survey observations lnj A. D. Bache, Superintenderd. ( Furni8hed by aiitTwrity of the Treasury Department to E. and G. W. Blunt, New York, and revised October, 1860.)
The following tables will enable navigators to ascertain the time and height of high and low water in some of the principal ports of the United States. The results are approximate, the -observations being still in progress, but they may safely be used for practical purposes. The number of places of observation, and the time during which many of them have been made, are steadily on the increase as the Coast Survey advances. The tides on the coast of the United States, on the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific, are of three different classes. Those of the Atlantic are of the most ordinary type, ebbing and flowing twice in twenty-four hours, and having hut moderate differences in height between the two successive high waters or low waters, one occurring before noon, the other after noon. Those of the Pacific coast also ebb and flow twice during twenty-four hours, but the morning and afternoon tides differ very considerably in height, so much so that at certain periods a rock which has three feet and a half water upon it at low tide may be awash on the next succeeding low water. The interva.ls1 too, between successive high and successive low waters may be very

unequal.

REPORT OF THE

SUPERINTENDE~T

OF

The tides of ports in the Gulf of Mexico, west of Cape St. George, ebb and flow, as a rule, but once in twenty-four hours, or are single day tides. At particular parts of the month there are two small tides in tho twenty-four hours. The rise and fall in all these ports is small. East of Cape St. George the rise and fall increases ; there are two tides, as a rule, during the twenty-four hours, and the daily inequality referred to in the Pacific tides is large. Tbese peculiarities require a different way of treating the cases, and in some of them separate tables. I propose to enable the navigator to find, from the Nautical Almanac and the following tables, the time and height of high and low water at any date within the ordinary range of difference produced by winds and other variable circumstances. I will endeavor to divest tho matter of unfamiliar technical expressions as far as practicable, though for shortness' sake, eome such terms may be employed after defining them. The discussion of the Gulf tides-has not been carried so far as to enable me to present the results in as definite a form as the others. As is well known, the interval between the time of the moon's crossing the meridian (moon's transit) and the time of high water at a given place is nearly constant; that is, this interval varies between moderate limits, which can be assigned. The interval at full and change of the moon is known as the establishment of the port, and is ordinarily marked on the charts. As it is not generally the average of the interval during a month's tides, it is a less convenient and less accurate quantity for the use of the navigation than the average interval which is used on the Coast Survey Charts, and is sometimes called the ''mean'' or '' corrected establishment.''* The following table gives the principal tidal quantities for the different ports named in the first column, where they are arranged under specific heads. The third column of the table gives the mean interval, in hours and minutes, between the moon's transit and the time of high water next after the transit ; the fourth, the difference between the greatest and the least interval occurring in different parts of the month, (lunar.) A simple inspection of this column will show how important it is to determine these changes in many of the ports where they amount to more than half an hour, or to more than fifteen minutes from the average interval. The fifth, sixth, and seventh columns refer to the height of the tide. The fifth gives, in feet, the average rise and fall, or average difference between high and low water. The sixth gives the greatest difference commonly known as the rise aud fall of spring tides; and the seventh the least difference known as the rise and fall of the neap tides. The average duration of the flood or rising tide is given in the eighth column; of the ebb or falling tide in the ninth; and of the period during which the tide neither rises nor falls, or the "stand," in the tenth. The duration of the flood is measured from the middle of the st.and at low water to the middle of the st.and at high water, so that the whole duration from one high water to the next, or from one low water to the next, should be given by the sum of the numbers in the eighth and ninth columns. At most of these places given in the list a mark of reference has been established for the height of the tide. I have omitted the description of these marks, (except in the following localities,) as of no particular interest in this con· nection. BENCH-MARKS.

*See remarks on page 144 and following.

Note.-The mean interval in column 3 bas been increased by 12h. 26m., (half a l!tean lunar day,) for some of the ports in Delaware river and Chesapeake bay, so as to show the succession of times from the mouth. Therefore 12h. 26m. ought to be subtracted from the establishments which are greater than that quantity before using them. The foregoing Table I gives the means of determining, roughly, the time and height of high water at the several ports named. The hour of transit of the moon preceding the time of high water is to be taken from the Almanac, and the mean establishment being added the time of high water results. Thus: Exampl,e I.-It is required to find the time of high water at New York on November 5, 1854. The American .Almanac gives Oh. Om. as the time of transit of the moon on that day. The mean interval for New York, from Table I, column 3, is Sh. 13m., ·which, as the transit was at Oh., is, roughly. the time of high water. The moon being full, the height is that of spring tides of column 6, viz: 5.4 feet. If the soundings on the chart are reduced to low water spring tides, 5.4: feet are to be added to them to give the depth at high water. If the soundings are reduced to mean low water, the rise and fall of mean tides being 1.1 foot less than for springs, the rise or increase of depth will be half of this, or O. 6 of a foot less than 5.4 feet, which. is 4.8 feet, .or nearly four feet t-en inches. Exampl,e IL-Required the time of high water at BOston on January 23, 1851. From the

136

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

American Almanac we find the time of the moon's southing or transit on that day 5h. 18m. a. m., and from Table I the mean interval at Boston dry dock is Uh. 27m. \Ve have then 5h. 18m. time of transit. To which add 11 27 mean interval from Table I. 16 45 time of high water, or 4h. 45m. p. m. If the Greenwich Nautical .Almanac is used, add 2m. to the time of transit of Greenwich for every hour of west longitude and its proportional part for less than an hour. It will suffice to take the half hour which may be over any number of hours, as the correction for less than this would be less than one minute, and need not be taken into account. Thus, Boston is 4h. 44m. west of Greenwich. The correction to be applied to the time of transit of the moon is, for the four hours, eight minutes, and for the forty-four minutes, one minute. The time of transit on the date assumed in the preceding example is l 7h. 9ni. of the 22d, or 5h. 9m. a. m. of the 23d, to which add nine minutes; the correction just found gives 5k. 18m., as before ascertained from the American Almanac. In using the United States Nautical .Almanac, in the astronomical part of which the transits of the moon are given for the meridian of Washington, the corrections required may, in this first approximation for the Atlantic coast, be neglected. To find the time of the next following Jow water add, from Table I, the duration of ebb tide. This gives 4k. 45m. p. m. timo of high water. 6 13 duration of ebb tide from Table I.
10 58 p. m. By subtracting the duration of flood tide we obtain the time of the preceding low water, lOh. 32m. a. m., recollecting that 4h. 45m. p. m. is the same as l6lz. 45m. reckoned from midnight. The height of this tide, corresponding to the transit of 5Jt., will bring it nearly to a neap tide, and the rise and fall obtained from column 7, Table I, is 8.5 feet. The next following high water may be had by adding to the time of low water the duration of flood from Table I. Thus: lOh. 58m. p. m. time of low water January 23. 6 13 duration of flood from Table I.

Sum 11" 11 or 5h. 11 m. on January 24. Or, having found the time of high water the time of the next following high water may be found by adding the duration of flood and ebb together, and their sum to the time of high water found, thus: 6h. 13m. duration of ebb tide, from Table I. 6 13 duration of flood. Sum
12 4 26 45

duration of whole tide. p. m., January 23, time of high water.

Sum 17 11 or 5h. llm. a. m., January 24, time of the next succeeding high water. Subtracting the same quantity will give the time of the preceding high water, thus: 4h. 45m. p. m., or 16lt. 45m. from midnight, is the time of high· water. 12 26 duration of flood and ebb tide. 4 19 a. m. of the 23d for the !}receding high water. The duration of the flood and the ebb being reckoned from th1'l middle of one stand or slack water to the middle of the next, the time of beginning of stand ·of ebb or flood will be found b bt . . Y su ra.ctmg half the duration of stand or slack water given by column 10, Table I, from the

In the Re the vnriationr; in the interval between the moon's transit and high water are shown for some of the principnl ports contained in Table I. These variations of intervals depend upon the age of the moon, and, as they go through their values in half a lunar month, are known as the half-monthly inequality of interval. 'l'he table extends from the Oh. of transit, mid· llight of the calcndllr day, or full of tlie moon, to 1 q hour&. The numbers for change of the moon corrc8pon<l to those of Oh., and for 13 hours (or lh. p. m. of the calendar day) to 1 hour, and so on up to 23 hours. Tbc ports for w·hich the numbers are given are designated by the heading of the column. 'l'he mean interval, it will be seen, does not occur at full and change, but nearly two days afterwards, on the Atlantic coast. At Key West it occurs more nearly at full and change, and at San Francisco still more nearly. The same remark applies to the heights i spring tides occur about two days after the full and change of the moon, and neaps two days after 'fhe firnt and last quarters. The use of this table of nearer approximation is quite as simple as that of Table I. Rule to find the lime of Mgh water.-Look in the Almanac for the time of moon's transit (or southing·) for tlic date required. In the table corresponding to that time will be fonnd the numbcr to be added to the time of transit. Example IJ!.-Requircd the time of high water at New York October 1, 1856. Using the United States Nautical Almanac we find the time of moon's transit lli. 24m. astronomical reckoning, or lh. 24m. p. m. calendar time. From Table II we have, under the heading of New York, for lh. 30m. (the nearest number to lh. 24m. in the table) 8h. lOm. Thus, to Vi. 24rn., time of moon's transit, Add 8 10 interval found in Table III. The sum 9 34 p. m. is the time of high water on the 1st of October, 1856. If the sum of these numbers had exceeded twelve, the tide would have belonged to October 2, and we must have gone back to the transit of the day before and computed with it to obtain the ti.de of October 1. Rule to find tlie height ef high icater.-Enter Table III, column 1, wit.h the time of moon's transit. In the column headed with the name of the place, and marked A, will be found the rise and fall corresponding to the time of transit; in column B the number to be added to i;nundings on the chart, where the soundings are given for mean low water; in column C the 11umbeT to be added to charts of which the soundings are given for low water spring tides. In the foregoi1 g example (III) the time of transit being 1 and 2 hours, we find from Table

THE UNITED ST.A.TES COAST St;RVEY.

139

III the rise and fall of tides on the 1st of October, 1856, between 4. 9 and 4. 7; the number to be added to soundings given for mean low water 4.£') foot. (column B,) and for low water spring tides (column C) 4.9 feet. Having found tbe time of high \\'ater, that of low water may lrn obtained, nearly, by adding the duration of ebb from column 9, 'l'able I. The time of the next preeedin;:; low \Vater may be found by subtracting the duration of flood from column 8, Table I. Tlic timo of the next following high water may be found by adding the dm:ation of both floocl and d11; and of the next preceding high water by subtracti11g the same uurntiou of the whole tide. Example lV.-To find the 11ext high water followiug tlrnt of Example III. The duration of flood, column 8, Table I, for Kew York is Gh. Om., and of ebb, from column 9, is Git. 25m.; the sum is 12h. 25m. To 9h. 34m. p. m., October 1, time of high water founu, Add 12 25 duration of flood and eLb. Sum 21 59 or 'JJ,. 59m. a. m. of October 2, the time of the next high water.

TIDES OF THE PACIFIC COAST AND OF PAilT OF TfIE COAST OF FLOIUDA.

On the Pacific coast there are, as a general rule, one large ancl ono small tide during the day, the height of the two successive high waters occurring one a. m. the other p. m. of the same twenty-four hours, arnl the intervals from the next preceding transit of the moon are very different. The inequalitier; depend upon the moon's declination; they disappear near the time of the moon's declination being· uothiug, an cl are greatest about the time of its being greatest. The inequalities for low water are not the 1mme as for l1igh, though they disappear and have the greatest value at nearly the same times. The tides of the southern part of Florida and of the western coast of that peninsula, as far as St. }Ltrk' s, are of the same character. In Puget's S)Und the inequalities for the interval of high water and for the height of low water follow this rule; but ihose for the interval of lo"· water and height of high \Yater di sap· pear about one day before the moon's declination is greatest, and aTe greatest about four or five days before the greatest declination. When the moon's declination is north, the highest of the two tides of the twenty-four hours occurs at San Francisco about eleven and a half hours after the moon's sou thing, (transit;) and when the declination is soutli, the lowest. of the two high tides occurs about that interval. 'l'he lowest of the two low waters of the day is one which follows next the highest high water. The nature of these tides will probably appear more plainly from the annexed diagrams. In them the height of the tide is set off at the side on a scale of feet, and the hours of the day are at the top. At 12 noon, for example, the tide-gauge marked 6.7 feet. Joining all the heights observed in the twenty-four hours ·we have a curve like that marked in the figure. The two high waters are a and c, the two low waters b and d. If a is the Jiigh water which occurs about twelve hours after the transit of the moon, when the declination is south, the ebb a b is quite small, and the high water, a, is much lower than the next high water, c. If the moon's declination is north, it is the large high water, a, of the second diagram which occurs next after the transit, and about twelve 11ours from it. At Key West the contrary obtains, diagram 1 applying when the moon's declination i;; north, and diagram 2 when south. Tables IV and V give the number to be added to the time of moon's transit to find the time of high water almost a;;i. readily as in the former case. They are of double entry, the time of transit being, as before, placed in tho first column. The number of days from the day at which the moon bad tho greatest declination is arranged at the top of the table. Entering the first column with tho time of transit, and following the line horizontally until we come under the column containing the days from

110

OF

the greatest declination, we find the number to be added time of high water. 7 If the moo:1' s declination is south, Table IV is to be used; G if north, Table V. Tables IV to IX, inclusive, have been recomputed, using more complete data for the inequalities above referred to, find to those for San Frnncisco similar tablet! have been added for San Diego, Astoria, Port Townshend, and Key ·, ·west, Fla. For the other places on the Western Coast given in Table I the following rules will give sufficiently c close approximations. To obtain the times of high or low water for San Pedro, elI Cuyler' s harbor, and San Luis Obispo, compute first the 7 time for Sun Diego by Tables IV, Y, or VIII; then add to 6 the time thus obtained 30 minutes to obtain the time for 5 San Luis Obispo, and subtract 13 minutes for Cuyler' s harbor. At Sun Pedro tho time of high or low water is sensibly the siime as at San Diego. For Monterey, South Farallono, l\fore Island, Benicia, Ravenswood, and Bodega, compute first the time for San 0 Francisco, then subtract from the time thus obtained lh. 44m. for Monterey, Ili. 2!1m. for the South Farallori, and 4!tm. for Bodega; and add 34:m. for :Mare island, Ill. 4rn. for Benicia, and 30m. for Ravenswood. For Humboldt bay, Port Orford, and N eeah harbor, compute first the time for Astoria, then subtract from it 40m. for Humboldt bay, 111. 16 ?n. for Port Orford, and Dm. for Neeah harbor. For Steilacoom and Semiahmoo bay, compute first the time for Port Townshend, and add to it 57m. for Steilacoom, and lh. for Semiahmoo. The approximation will be only a rnugh one for Steilacoom. For the heig·hts, Tables VI, VII, and IX for San Diogo can be used without change for San Pedro, Cnyler' s harbor, and San Luis Obispo. These tables for San Francisco are also applicable to :Monterey, South Farallon, and Bodega. For Mare island add 1.2 foot, for Benicia, 0. 9 foot, and for Ravenswood, 2. 7 feet to the quantities for San Francisco. For Humboldt bay, Port Orford, and Neeah harbor, the tables for Astoria may be used, subi:racting J. 7 foot for HmnboJdt bay, and 1. O foot for Port Orford. For Neeah harbor the tables will give approximate results without change. For Semiahrnoo bay, add one foot to the quantities in the tables for Port Townshend. For Steilacoom, a rough approximation may be obtained by adding 4. 6 feet to them. For the coast of Florida, compute the times of high or low water for Key West, and subtract 12m. for Indian key, and add 26m. for Tortugas and lh. 5Im. for Egmont key, 3h. 45m. for Cedar keys, and 411. Sm. for St. Mark's. For the heights, add half a foot for Indian key, and use the tables without change for Tortugas and Egmont key. For Cedar keys and St. Mark's, the results could not be obtained with much accuracy in this way; special tables will be pre· pared for those places.

HEPOHT OF TffE SCPEIUNTENDENT

OF

If we disrcgarLl the daily incqualit.'·, the column headed San Francisco in Tal>lo II would give us, as in the cxumpleil on the Atlantic coast, the menns of determining the time of high water. E'.J:an1ple T~-Rcqufre<l tlie time of l1igh water at :~·forth Dench, San Francisco, Cal., on the Ith of Fehrnary, 1853. J:.;t. The time of the moon's transit at Greenwich, from the Nautical Almanac, is 1 lh. 41 m.; the lougitude of San }1 rancisco Sh. lOm., requiring a correction of 16m. to the time of transit for Sau Prancisco, ·which is thus found to be 11 lt. 57 m. 2<l. The moou' s declination is son th, and at the time of transit about hvo days after the,, greate::;l. Entcri1112: Table IY, we ±ind 12ll. (or Oli.) of tranHit, the nearest number to llh. 57rn. which the table gives; and follm\·ing tho Iino horizontally, until ·we come to two days after the greatest <ledination, we fin<l l::lh. 1-!m. To llli. 57m., time of transit of tlie moon, February 7, San Fmncisco, add 13h. 14m., from column Oh., transit, arnl two days after greatest doclirrntion; the sum, 25/i. J lm., or lh. l lm., Fe lunary 8, i,; the time of high water, cunesponding to the transit wliich we took of February 7. If we desire tho tide of February 7 we must go back to the moon's transit of the 6th. The exarnple was purposely assumell to show this ca,,c. 1171. Olm., time of transit Fchruary G, 1853. 13 31 number for llh. transit, and one day from greatest declination.
Sum 2-1

32

time of high wutor Oli. 32m. a. m. February 7.

Tlic ltdgld qf ltigli 1cater.-Tilc Leight of high water is obtained in a similar manner by the use of Table YI and Table VII, euteriug these i11 the same way with the time of transit and days from the greatest ucclination. Table VI ii; for south declination, alld Table VII for north.

HEPORT OF THE SUPERTh"TENDENT OF

Example VL-In Example V, to obtain the height of tide on February 7, the declination being south, we enter Table YI for San Francisco, with Oli. of transit, and two days after greatest declination, and find that the tide will be 4. 5 feet above the mean of the lowest low \\·ater, or that 4.5 feet are to be added to the soundings of a chart reduced to the mean of the lowest low "·aters of each day. If the soundings of the chart are given for mean low water, then 1.2 feet ought to be subtracted from the Tables VI and VII; thus, in this example it would be 3. 3 feet. The approximate time of tho successive low and high waters of the clay will be found by adding the numbers in Table VIII to the time of the first high water already determined. The table gives the numbers for the different days from the greatest declination.

The days from the greatest declination are written in the first and Inst columns of the table. The second, third, and fourth columns refer to south declination, and fifth, sixth, and seventh to north, and the reverse for Key West. The second column gives the number which is to be added, according to the declination, to the time of high water, obtained by means of Tables IV and V, to give the next low water, ·which is the small low ·water, b, of diagram I. The third contains the numbers to bo added to the same to give the secornl or large high water, c, of diagram I. Tbc fourth, the numbers to be added to the same to give the second or large low water, cl, of diagram I. The succeeding columns give the numbers to be used in the same way for north declination to obtain the low water, b, (large,) of diagram II; the high water, c, (small,) and the low water, d, (small,) of the sam<~ diagram. The rise and fall of the same successive tides may he obtained by inspection from Table IX, in which the first column at the side con· tains the time of transit, and the successive columns the numbers corresponding to that time, and to foe number of days from greatest declination. The arrangement of this table is like that, already given. The numbers for the small ebb tide, ab of diagram I, or c d of diagram II, are first given; then those for small low anll large high waters, b c for diagram I, and d e of diagram II; next, the large ehlJ tide, c d of diagram I, or ab of diagram II; and lastly, from the large low water to the small high water, de of diagram I, or b c of diagram II.

ExamJjle VIL-Thus, in Example VI, the high water of February 7th was found to be 3.3 feet above mean low water. The declination being south, Diagram I applies, and this l1igh water is the small one. To obtain the fall of the next low water or small low water, we enter Table IX, for San Francisco, with Oh. of moon's transit, and two days after the gTeatest declination in the first part of the table, and find 1. 9 foot, which will be the difference in the height of this high and low water. Entering with the same transit and day in the second part, we find 3.0 feet, which is the rise of the large high above the small low water; the difference between 1.9 and 3.0 or 1.1 foot is the difference of height of the two successive high waters. It is easy to see how, in this way, the soundings of a chart can be reduced to what they Would be approximately at a1J the SUCCeS8iVe high aud }ow waters.
TIDES OF THE GULF OF MEXICO.

On the coast of Florida, from Cape Florida around the peninsula to St. Mark's, the tides ar<i of the ordinary kind, but with a d.o1:ily inequality which, small at Cape Florid~ goes on ~ncreW1ing as we pro~ed westward to Tortugas. From the Tortugas to St. Mark' Iii the daily mequality is large and stmsibly the same, giving the tides a great resemblance to those of the

158

REPORT OF THE SUPERIXTENDENT OF

Pacific coast, though the rise and fall is much sma1ler. Between St. Markt s and St. George's island, Apalachicola entrance, the tides change to the single day class, ebbing and flowing but once in the twenty-four (lunar) hours. At St. George's island there are two tides a day, for three or four days, about the time of the moon's declination being zero. At other times there is but one tide a day, with a long stand at high water of from six to nine hours. From Cape St. Blas to and including the mouth of the Mississippi, the single day tides are very regular, and the small and irregular double tides appear only for two or three days, (and frequently even not at all,) about the time of zero declination of the moon. The stand at high and low water is comparatively short, seldom r xceeding an hour. To the west of the mouth of the Mississippi the double tides reappear. At fale Demiere they are distinct, though a little irregular for three or four days near the time of the moon's zero declination. At all other times the single day type prevails, the double, tides modifying it, however. in the shape of a long stand of from six to ten hours at high water. This stand is shortest at the time of the moon's greatest declination, sometimes being reduced to but one hour. At Calcasieu the tides are distinctly double, but with a large daily inequality. The rise and fall being small, they would often present to the ordinary observer the same appearance as at Isle Derniere. At Galveston the double tide;; are plainly perceptible, though small, for five or six days at the time of moon's zero declination. At other times they present the single day type, with the peculiarity that, after standing at high water for a short time, the water falls a small distance, and stands again at that height for several hours, then continues to fall to low water. Sometimes it falls very slowly for nine or ten hours following high water, and then acquires a more rapid rate to low water. At Aransas Pass and Brazos Santiago the single day tides prevail. Small, irregular, doubic tides are only perceived for two or three dayt-i at the moon's zero declination. At all other times there is but one high water in the day, with a long stand of from six to nine hours, during which there are often small, irregular fluctuations or a very slow fall. In the following table the mean rise and fall of tides at the above stations are given. The highest high and the lowest low waters occur when the greatest declination of the moon happen;; at full or change; the least tide when the moon's declination is nothing at the first or last quarter. The rise and fall being so small, the times and heights are both much influenced by the winds, and are thus rendered quite irregular. TABLE X. Rise and fall at several stations on the G ul/

'IO DE'IEHMINE TUE RISE AND FALL OF THE TIDES I<OR ANY

GIVE~

TIME FROM HIGH OR LOW WATER.

It is sometimes desirable to know how far the tide will rise in a given time from low water, or fall in a given time from high water, or to approximate to the time which has elapsed from low or high water, by knowing the rise and fall of the tide in the inten·a1. If the proportion of the rise and fall in a given time were the same in the different ports, this would easily be shown in a single table, gi\·ing the proportional rise aod fall, wbicb, by referring to Table I, showing the rise and fall of the tide at the port, would give the rise and fall in feet and decimals. The proportion, however, is not the same in different ports, nor in the :mmc ports for tides of different heights. The following Table XI shows the relation between the heights above low water for each half hour for New York and Old Point Comfort, and for spring and neap tides at each p]ace. Units express the total rise of high water above low water, and the figures opposite to each half hour devote the proportional fall of the tide from high water onward to low water. For example, at New York, three hours after high water, a spring tide has fallen six-tenths (sixty hundredths) of the whole fall. Suppose the whole rise aud fall of that day to be 5.4: feet, (Table I;) then, three hours after high water, the tide will have fallen 3. 24 feet, or three feet three inches, nearly. Conversely, if we have observed that a spring tide has fallen three feet three inches, we may know that high water has passed about three l1ours.

TIDES IN COASTING.

By observing the time of high water and low water along the coast we find the places at which they are the same. The map of co·tidal lines (Sketch No. 65, C. S. Rep., 1857} shows that it is high water nearly at the same hour all along the coaAt from Sandy Hook to Cape Cana.vera.l; <>f cour5e not in bays and harbors and up the rivers, but on the outer coast~

It is high water exactly at the same hour all along the line marked XII, seen on the chart, near Sandy Hook, and north and south of Hatteras, and, with small interruptions at Cape Lookout and Cape Fear, all the way to near Cape Caiii;,veral. This same line extends eastward to near Block island, and south of Nantucket, and then passes away from our coast. .At full and change of the moon, along this line, (approximately,) it is high water at twelve o'clock, Greenwich time, the local time of high water depending upon the longitude of the place; or, to speak more correctly, in the average of a lunar month it is high water so many hours after the time of the moon's passing the meridian of Greenwich. By these lines, called co-tidal. lines, we can determine what tidal currents the navigators must expect to meet in coasting; ' and for this purpose we divide the ports of the coast into two sets, those south and those north of Now York. The sailing lines of coasters, bound to southern ports this side of the straits of Florida, are marked upon the map, and also of those bound through tho sounds to eastern.ports, and outside to Halifax and European ports.
VESSELS TO AND FR01-i PORTS SOUTH OF NEW YORK.

South of Sandy Hook, New Jersey, the line of XII hours is nowhere more than 18 miles from the coast; that of XI~ nowhere more than 35 miles; that of Xq nowhere more than 48; and XI nowhere more than 110. The distance of these lines of XII to XI hours, (corresponding within four minutes to YII and VI of New York time, for different parts of the coast, is shown from Table A, where the first column gives the name of the place, and the second, third, fourth, fifth, respectively, the distances of the co-tidal lines of XII, XIt xq, ·and XI hours. The distances are measured from the ports on perpendiculars to the co-tidal lines. They may be taken as if measured on the parallel of latitude at all the points for the line of XII hours, and at; all between Sandy Hook and Cape Hatteras for the lines of XIl and XI~ hours.

The co-tidal lines are in such directions that at 10, 20, and 30 miles from the coast, between Sandy Hook and the St. John's, there is but a variation of seven minutes, and even to Cu,pe Canaveral only of eight minutes. Keeping ten miles from the shore the coaster would pass from 12 hours at Sandy Hook to 11 hours 45 minutes at Hatteras, aHd increase again irreg11larly to 1'..!. hours 1 minutes at the St. John's, as shown more explicitly in table B. These three tracks of 10, 20, and 30 miles are inside of the cold wall of the Gulf Stream, and generally in the cold current, except at Cape Canaveral. B.

It follows, then, as a general thing, from these two tables that the coa;;:ter, in pa:<sing from Sandy Hook to the St. John's would have the tines the same, within some fifteen minutes, as if he remained .at Sandy Hook; so that having, for example, at high water, he would, acconling to the elapi,;ed time, have the ebb and flood alternating every six hours and a quarter, nearl_y, as if he had remained near Sandy Hook. As the Hood tide sets in generally to the northward and on shore, and the ebb to the southward and off shore, he would know by the time that elapsed from his departure and the period of the tide at which he started what tidal currents he might expect to meet as he passed along the coast. Thir<, of course, is not peculiar to Sandy Hook as a point of departure, but would be true for any of the entrances given in the table, taking care not to mistake the time of tides within for that at the entrance. By r.eferring to George W. Blunt, esq., I have obtained the tracks of sailing and steam vessels passing from New York to ports to the !lonth of it, as shown by the lines on the chart accompanying this paper. (See Sketch No. 65, C. S. Rep., 1857.) Tracing these on the map of co-tidal lines, I have determined how the navigator would find the tides as he passes from 21 c

Thus, from Sandy Hook to Delaware bay, starting with 12 hours 5 minutes, off Barnegat tlierc would be, at the same instant, 11 hours 57 minutes, and off Cape May 12 hours 10 minutes, so that the navigator would have the same succession of tides whether he remained at Sandy Hook or passed onward to Delaware bay, or whether he came from Delaware. bay to Sandy Hook. So from Sandy Hook to Charleston he will find, at the same instant, :I.2 hours 5 minutes at Sandy Hook, 11 hours 57 minutes off Barnegat, 11 hours 45 minutes off Cape May, and so onward upon the parallels of latitude for the several points. For all practical purposes, then, of coasting, the succession of the tides, and, ef course, ef the tidal currents ef flood and ebb will be the same a8 if t71e navigator remained rdationary. Leaving at low water he will meet the flood for G hours 15 minutes, and then the ebb for another 6 hours 15 minutes, and so on. It is the simplest of all rules that has thus come out of this investigation. That remarkable change of the temperature between the waters of the in-shore cold current and the warm waters of the Gulf Stream occurring in so short a distance that Lieutenant Bache called it the "cold wall," takes place at distances off the coast of from 110 to 29 miles, (see Table D,) between Sandy Hook and Cape Canaveral, measmed, from the several points named in the table, at right angles to the direction of the course, or measured along the parallels of latitude of the points, at distances from 195 to 28 miles, between Assateague and Cape Canaveral, (Table D.) The points where the parallels north of Assateagne meet this division line have not been accurately determined. The annexed table shows these distances measured at right angles and on the parallels.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Jn passing from N cw York to an eastern port the first great change in the tides and tidal iR behvcen ihe East river and Long Island sound; the difference between Governor's island and Negro point, on Ward's island, at the eastern entrance to Hell Gate, is two hours and forty-five minutes. Between this point and Throg' s Point tbe change i.s small. The mar·i11cr is now ill ihe full tide of the sound, and between Throg'R Point and Fir:;her's island there is a difference of time of but two hours and twenty minutes, the greatest part of which is at the head of the sound and at ib; entrance, that is, near Thmg' s Point and Fisher's island. From off New London to off Sand's Point the difference is but one hour and forty minutes, so that if the mariner, instead of 1·emaining at Throg' s Point, passes onward to Fisher's island he ' would lose but half a tide in the whole passage. In other words, he would have the same i:mccession of rise and fall, according to tho time elapsed, whether stationary or passing onward, within two hours and a half, or less than half a tide. 'l'he ticlal current lines show that even a less allowance i3 to be made for the change of cunent than for the ehangc of tide; the difference in the change of current.between Throg's Point and Fisher's island, along the middle of the sound, being of no practicable importance. PasRing out of Long Island sound the tidal hours grow earlier, uptil off Block island that of Sandy Hook is again reached. The co-tiual line of Sandy Hook and Block island being the same, it is the struggle of tho same tide through New York bay and the narrow East river, and obstructed Hell Gate, and through Fisher's island and Long Island sound, and to Throg's Point. The tidal currents meet near Throg' s Point. The lower part of N urragansett bay has the co-tidal hour 12 hours, nearly. Buzzard's bay has nearly the same co-tidal hour, the tide wave reaching the shore at nearly the s&me time all around the bay. It would be impossible to give in a small compass a minute account of the tides of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket sound. In general it may be said that as far as Holmes' s Hole and \Vood's Hole they resemble those of Block island sound, and afterwards those of Mouomoy, at the eastern entrance; but this generalization is unsatisfactory without more details than there is space here to give. In these sounds take place the remarkable change of between three and four hours, the greatest change of our coast, dislocating, as it were, the times of high water at places south and west and east and 1wrth of Nantucket. The whole of this change takes place beh('een the eastern entrance of Nantucket sound and the western of Martha's Vineyard, giving rise to quite a complex condition of both tides and cunents, which it has occupied much time to uuravel. The clominant co-tidal line of our coast, from Block island to Cape Canaveral, is that of 12 hours of Greenwich time; that of our eastern coast, from Nantucket to Passamaquoddy, is, in general, 15 hours. Passing out of Nantucket sound coasters carry nearly the same co-tidal hour to Cape Cod, and thence vary their time about half an hour in passing to Boston, to Portsmouth, to Portland, or to Passamaquoddy. It has long been known that the tidal almanac for Boston might practically be used for eastern ports. Vessels from New York to Ilalifax, and New York to Europe, which keep outside, and should keep well off the Nantucket shoals, and off George's, as shown by the track on the chart, vary their co·tidaJ hour but little, keeping between the lines of 12 and 11~ until quite well on their course, and beyond Cape Suble. 'l'Jie same rule wilJ apply to their case as has been given for vessels between New York and a southern port.

APPENDIX No. 17.
Lecture on the Gulf Stream, prepared at tlie rcque8t qf the Amc1·ican .Association for the Advancement qf Science. By A. D. Badie, Supt. U. S. Coa.st SmTey.

By request of the :.issociation,at their last meeting &t Springfield, I present. a summary of the results of the Gulf Stream explorations made by the officers of the Coast Survey. The Gulf Stream is the great hydrographic feature of the lJ nited States coast, and no survey of the coast could be complete for the purposes of navigation without it. Hence the explorations have been early undertaken, and thoroughly carried on. But as it required peculiar means, and special adaptation in the officers to this line of research, and did not require a continuous survey, the work has been executed from time to time, as means and officers could be had, without interference with the more regular operaticns of the hydrography. An act of Congress which refern to tliis survey requires the immediate presentation of its results to Collgress, and they have, therefore, been discussed as soon as procured, and have been given to the public. This is the great sea mark of the coast of the United States, both Gulf and Atlantic, and its qualities as hindrances and aids to navigation require that the navigator should be well informed in regard to them. In order to present an inte111gible summary of the results obtained by the Coast Survey in the short time allowed for a lecture, it is necessary to condense the subject very considerably; to omit matters at all extraneous to the subjects in hand, and to confine myself to a brief and direct statement of the uieans employed in examining the stream from its swface to its depths, the methods qf studying the results, and qf tlie results tllem.selt'es. The temperatures in and near the Gulf Stream are among thP most striking of its pecilliarit,ies, and therefore have formed one principal object of observation. It will be necessary, in order to briug the subject within limits, to confine myself chiefly at this time to the consideration of this class of facts, and to the results and laws connected with them. I shall proceed, therefore, to consider the subject under the following heads: I. The instruments for determining depths and temperatures, and for obtaining specimens of the bottom. II. The plan of research. III. The method of discussion of the results. IV. The results, consisting of type curves, of the law of change of temperature, with depth at several characteristic positions. Type curves, showing the distribution of temperature across the stream, represented by two sets of curves, one in which the variable te@perature at the same depth is shown, and the other in which the variable depth of the same temperature is represented. Upon the diagrams showing these latter curves the figure of the bottom of the sea is given where it has been obtained. Discussion in regard to the cold wall, vrhich is one of the most interesting features of the approach to the Gulf Stream. V. The limit pf accuracy of the re;mlts. VI. The figure of the b~ttom of the ocean belu"- the Gulf Stream. VII. The general features of the Gulf Stream as to temperature. These points are illustrated by diagrams, enabling the eye to follow the results as they are -stated.
I.
INSTRUMENTS.

1. For temperatures.-The instrument for determining temperatures should fulfil the two conditions of registering its indications and of ueing unaffected by pressure. The common mercurial

166

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

thermometer, while it answers perfectly for the determination of temperatures at the surface, fails in both the conditions stated. The ordinary self-registering thermometer, or self-registering metallic thermometer in the watch form, as made by Breguet; llfontandon, and Jiirgemien, when pro;·ided with a suitable cover to protect it from pressure, answers a good purpose, and has been extensively applied in the course of the observations. .As a rule, it is only the minimum temperature thermometers that must he used, us the temperatures decrease generally in descending. An ordinary self-registering minimum thermometer placed in a glass globe was succes>ifnlly used by Commander Charles H. Davis and by Lieut. G. M. Bache. It has the disadvantage of taking the temperature alowly, and of being inapplicable below a certain depth. Small hollow cylindrical brass vessels, which were divided in two parts, closely fitting by grinding, and within which the Breguet thermometers of the watch form were placed, were an improvement upon the globe, as taking the temperature of the sea more n1pidly; but, besides the difficulty of making the joint tight, they were crushed by the pressure at even moderate depths. The substitution of the globe for the cylinder extended the range of these instruments, but the thermometers wore often crushed or injured by the access of the sea water to the interior of the globe. Six's self-registering thermometers, as bearing considerable pressure without injury, and ·without rendering the indications erroneous, and as requiring no case to enclose them, except to prevent breaki11g from accidental knocks in handling, are very useful. They are still favorite8 with many of the officers, though others complain of their great liability to derangement, especially if the mercury is not perfectly clean, when the mercurial column easily separntes, and some skill is required to bring it together. These instruments are, from their cheapness, still furnished to the parties, and are used successfully at depths reaching about one hundred fathoms, and on occasions considerabl7 lower. Keeping them in order requires the skill of an experimenter rather than that of an observer, and hence they do not satisfactorily fulfil the conditions of the prohlem. Tho metallic thermometer of Joseph Saxton, esq., of the United States Office of Weights and :Measures, is based upon the coil form of that of Breguet. Two stout ribands of silver and platinum are coiled and carefully united with silver solder, the more expansive metal in the interior. A. coil of gold, to which each is soldered, serves to prevent tlie tendency of the silver and platinum to separate. The lower part of the coil is fastened to a ·brass stem, which passes up through tho axis of the coil, while the opposite end to that at which the stem is attached is firmly fastened to the base of a short cylinder, which keeps that end of the coil from turning, and so gives the whole motion of tlie opposite end of the coil to the stem, which in turning indicates the turning of the coil from the relative expanding or contracting of the meta.ls composing it. In this short cylinder are the wheels which serve to magnify the motion of the coil, a ban<l upon the dial indicating the motion, and pushing before it a registering hand, moving with sufficient friction merely to retain its place w11en thrust forward by tho index hand of tho thermometer. These instruments are graduated by trial. The brass·and silver portions receive a thick coating of gold by the electrotype process, to prevent the action of the sea water upon them. When kept clean by frequent wa!!hing in fresh water, and in good order, and frequently compared with the standards to guard against accidental derangements, these thermometers answer admirably all the required conditions. The length of the coil measured along its axis should not be less than six inches, as the interposition of wheels to magnify the motion should as far as possible be avoided. The water being all around the coil, which is a good conductor and has a low specific heat, the instrument readily feels the temperature of the part of the sea where it is exposed, and registers it to less than half a degree (say ():l.2) with certainty. The box which covers the coil and indicating part of the thermo· meter is merely to protect it from accidental injury, and is open so as to permit the sea water to pass freely through it. Sketch No. 19 gives a . view of Saxton's metallic thermometer, ~nd itR Yarious parts in detail. Although there seems no reason to doubt that this instrument 18 free from any el:foct from pressure, it was deemed desirable to try it actually by extreme

pressure, and a series of ex~eriments made by J. M. Batchelder, esq., showed that at pressures less than that corresponding to 600 fathoms the effect was lcsR than one degree, (. 25 to 1° ;) and at pressures from 600 to 1, 500 fathoms tho clrnngo amounted to little more than from 7° to 9° Fahr., the index returning when the pressure was removed. For great depths, the effects of pressure must be ascertainetl, as it is specific in each instrument, and prnlrnbly chiefly depends upon some mechanical defect in the construction, as in the soldering.* The apparatus used in these experiments on the eITect of pressure was a very ingeuious one for testing h~'draulic engines, by Mr. Thomas Davison, of the Novelty Iron Works of New York.-(Fig. No. 12, Sketch No. 20.) · 2. For deyJt!t.-When the depth becomes considerable, the usual sounding line fails entirely to give it, especially if there is a current, and more especially if there is besides a counter current. The amount of "stray line" is variable. This subject has been ably examined of late years by Commanders 1laury and S. P. Lee, Lieutenants Berryman, Brooke, and others of our navy, and by Commander Daymau and others of the British navy, and especially by Professor Trowbridge, of the Coast Survey, in his memoir read beforn the association (''Deep Sea Soundings, by ,V. P. Trowbridge, Assistant U. S. Coast Sun·e~y") at the meeting in Baltimore, and republished in the American Journal of Science and Arts, vol. xxviii, for the year 1858. The use of Ogden's 'tr Ericcson' s leads to 100 fathoms is still con tiuued liy some of the officers of the survey. though at such deptlis nothing Leiter than the c:ommon sounding line is, in fact, required. Massey's leaJ, with W"oltrmrn's wheel as aa indicator, has been exteusively used of late years. :M:r. Saxton' 8 indicator is more simple than ~fassey' s. but acts upon foe same principle. To remedy the defect of the turning of the cord of the lead line, two indicators are applied, one on each side of the axis. Professor Trowuridge's lead, modified some· what from that described at the meeting of the Association in Baltimore, has recently been tried with good success by Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson in the last soumfoig;; across the straits of Florida for the telegraph to Havana. The most reliable observations heretofore made in the Coast Survey have been with Massey's indicator. TJ1e errors are not such as to affect the development of the laws of change at the moderate depths reached in most of the observations, and at great depths the changes are very slow. The new apparatus will haYe the advantage of saving a great deal of time, and therefore avoid inaccuracies from change of position during the sounding. 3. For obtaining specimens ef the bottom.-Tbe only .satisfactory test of having reached the bottom of the sea at considerable depths being the bringing up of a specimen, this has been a subject of constant study with us. The different instruments invented by Lieutenant Stellwagen, Commander Sands, Lieutenant Craven, Lieutenant Berryman, Lieutenant Brooke, and other officers of our navy, are all in use for different kinds of bottom, and according to the preference given by different hydrographic chiefs. The one most commonly used in these explorations has been Lieutenant Stellwagen's invention-a cup placed below ihe sounding lead, covered by a valve of leather, which slides up the stem of the cup and opens when the lead is descending, closing when it is raised. The weight of the lead, and tlie tnrnillg of the cord generally, suffice to sink tho cnp into the bottom, filling it; and when the vah-e is made to close tightly by a piece of flexible leather below the stiff disk, the specimen i;; not washed out as the lead is drawn up. In Commander Sandti' s sounding apparatus a 8pring keeps an outer eylinder over an opening in an inner hollm·· one, until it reaches the bottom, when the outer cylinder is forced upwards, and the opening at the side of tl1e iuner one, which, having a conical termination, penetrates the bottom, permitting a specimen of the bottom to pass in.

PLAN OF TIIE WORK,

The plan of the work was simple. The temperatures were to be ascertained at various depths, at different distances from the coast, on sections as nearly at right angles with the stream as practicable, the sections starting from some point well known in position. The temperatures were to be taken at distances diminishing as the changes of temperature were more rapid. So in regard to depth; the observations were to be multiplied in the strata of rapidly varying temperatures near the surface. So in regard to position, when the cold water near the coast was rapidly exchanging for the warm water of the Gulf Stream, the sections diminishing in distance a:; the source of the warm water was approached. The vessel's position was determined with refei-ence to some prominent point, Sandy Hook or Cape }fay, for example. 'l'he course run was perpendicular to the supposed axis of the stream, SE. Several position" were taken np in succession, and at each the temperature ascertained at the surface, at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, or GOO fathoms, or depths found to apply more satisfactorily, under the general rule, to the positiwi and section. Having crossed the stream, any position found to be desiral,ile could be assumed on returning, and the extreme position reached was verified by the return to the coast. The summer season was selected for the standard observations for various reasons, but chiefly for two, namely, that the weather permitted more accurate work, and the phenomena were more likely to be those of equilibrium when the surface water was more slowly changing its temperature. Our little vessels could not, without considerable danger, be exposed to the roughness of the wind and water in the Gulf Stream in winter, and when we attempted comparative winter observations disappointment was often the result. The loss of one valuable officer and ten of his crow, and the extreme peril of another, in autumnal explorations of the Stream, has but too fully justified these precautions. The propriety of the selection of the summer for making the observations was completely proved by the success in determining the laws of temperatures. Thei,;e observations were but incidental to the hydrography of the coast, and hence were only prosecuted when means could be spared from other more pressing and regular parts of.the work. It was only a favorable conjunction in regard to officers, means, weather, adaptation of vessel, and the like, which gave results even when attempted. Too mnch credit cannot be assigned to those who have succeeded in this laborious and perilous work, and their names have been kept in close connection with their results whenever and wherever brought before the public, and have been carefully preserved in the archives of the survey. Charles H. Davis, George M. Bache, S. P. Lee, Richard Bache, John N. Maffitt, T. A. Craven, Otway H. Berryman, B. F. Sands, and John 1Vilkinson, make up the list of our successful observers in this field within the last sixteen years. Their names you will see attached to the sections run by them on the general diagram of the Gulf Stream (Sketch No. 21) presented to you this evening. The first was run, in 1844, from Nantucket southward and eastward by Commander C. IL Davis, now the accomplished superintendent of the Nautical Almanac, and the last, in 1860, by Lieutenant John Wilkinson, from the Tortugas southeast to the coast of Cuba. The work still goes on perseveringly. The number of sections nm has been fourteen; the number of positions on these sections occupied three hundred; and the number of observations made for temperature thirty-s~x hundred. The limits below which the stream and the adjacent waters have been explored for temperatures are from latitude 23° N. to .41° N., and frQIJl longitude 83° W. to 66~0 W.; from near Havana to near Cape Cod, and from the Tortugas to 9~ 0 E. of Cape Henlopen.

distance along the axis of the Gulf Stream to the most northeastern point in the North Atlantic measures nearly 1,400 nautical miles.

METHOD OF DISCUSSION OF REST;LTS.

These have generally been discussed by diagrams; sometimes by analyticnl formulae. The former method is generally best adapted to the character and degree of accuracy and circumstances of the observations. The diagrams finally adopted, after trial, were chiefly of three different kinds: one for the discussion of the change of temperatures with depth; the two others for the change of temperature with position as well as depth. Of the first of these diagrams, Nos. 1 and 2 (Sketch No. 19) are specimens. The depths constitute the ordinates, and the temperature the abscissre of a curve, showing the law of change of temperature with the depth. Upon the horizontal lines at the top of the paper th~. temperatures from ten degrees to ten degrees Fahr. are written, and on the vertical line at the side the depths. The separate observations being represented by dots, the curve is drawn with a free hand among them. The next two classes of diagrams give the distribution of temperature across tbe sections; in the first, the temperature corresponding to the same depth; in the second, the depths corresponding to the same temperatures. In this latter the figm·e of the bottom. is shown when ascertained. In both classes the distances from the cape, or headland, city, or inlet, which is tlie origin of the section, is marked, and the several positions occupied for observing, so that the abscissre of the curve are the distances from the point of beginning. In the first, (see Diagram No. 4 1 Sketch No. 19,) the temperatures are marked on the vertical lines at the left side of the diagrams, the ordinates of the curve thus corresponding to temperatures. In the second, (see Diagram No. 9, Sketch No. 19,) the depths are similarly written, the ordinates thus corresponding to depths. The notes or legend shows in the first case to what depths the curves correspond, and in the second to what temperatures. The observations at each position being plotted according to its temperature or depth in the two classes of diagrams, the curve is drawn with a free hand among the points. It should be observed that the discussion of each season's observation was, in general, made separately, and that the results of one, two, or three seasons grouped were announced separately, leaving to the new obser~ations to confirm or refute the conclusions drawn. It is a remarkable fact that, with i:,uch difficulties in the way in the character of the phenomena to be observed-in the diversity of seasons and of observers-that the phenomena have always been readily deducible from the observationl"\, and that the separate discussions have been confirmations, the following of the preceding; in fact, that the nature of the medium in which the work has been performed, in its relations to heat, has more than compensated for othP-r difficulties, and that the result3 are more accordant than the elaborate ones obtained from the progress of temperature below tlie surface of the ground by the experienced and skilful obserYers who have made them. Few observations have been rejected in the whole series. I need 11ot notice special diagrams, which will be explained when your attention is called to them. Where the character of the diagrams to be made had been definitively fixed, they were prepared under the direction of the chiefs of parties, so that I was relieved of the personal labor of repreaenting the results. In the subsequent general discussions I was greatly assisted by Prof. Pendleton, U. S. N., and by Prof. W. P. Trowbridge, Assistant U. S. Coast Survey, who has made a general review of the ,.,h;ie of the results, preparatory to their publication in a. volume of the Records and Results of the Coal'lt Survey.

RESUI,TS.

I. Type curres qf law ef temperature with depth at the most characteristic positions.-Tbe two most characteristic positions are in the cold current between the land and the Gulf Stream and in the axis of the stream itself. (a.) Diagram No. 1, Sketch No. 19, is a specimen of the type curve in the cold current. The long tongue from the surface to about 50 fathoms in depth is the overflow of the warm water of the Gdf Stream, the temperature varying from SP to about 55°. The temperatures in the .. mass of water from 50 fathoms down to 500 fathoms are just such as would take place in a · mass of ·water heated by conduction from the surface; the Jaw i8 that of a logarithmic curve in which the condnding power of sea· water is the modulous of the ~ystem. A comparison of many of these curves with the logarithmin form showed that it was appli· cable i:o them within the limits of the probable error of the observations. Taking the warm stratum from the Gulf of liexico above, and the cold polar strntum below; the mass of the water is heated by conduction. The bottom of the sea ha;o; not been reached under the axis of the Gulf Stream north of Cape Lookout, on the North Carolina coast. Tbis form of curve wns deduced iu 1844 from the observations of Commander Charles H. Davis, and "-as t11e first discovery made in connection with the then recently commenced sys· tematic exploration of i:he Gulf Stream by the Coast Survey. (b.) Nos. 2, 3, and 3 bis, Sketch No. 19, are specimens of the type curve in the Gulf Stream, taken from the sections off Cape Henry, Cape Hatteras, and Charleston, being characterized by the comparatively short beak or projection, and the persistence of the higher temperature to great depths, as 55-~· to 425, 550, 450 fathoms, giving the peculiar shape to this curve between 50 and 500 fathoms. II. Type curves qf distribution of temperofare across the stream. (a.) Curves of temperature at the .same depth.s.-The sections made are the following, beginning the enumeration at the Gulf of Mexico: 1. 'l'ortugas to Havana. 2. Sombrero key to Salt key. . 3. Carysfort L. H. to Cuba. 4. Cape Florida to Bernini. 5. Off Cape Canaveral. 6. Off St. .Augustine. 7. Oif St. Simon's, Georgia. 8. Ofl' Charleston. 9. Off Cape Fear. 10. Off Cape Hatteras. 11. Off Cape Henry. 12. Off Cape May. 13. Off Sandy Hook:. 14. Off Cape Cod, being, on the average, one to each huIJdred miles along the axis of the stream. These are marked on the grmernl diagram, (Sketch No. 21,) the names of the explorers being stated in the column which gives tl1e point of origin of each section. The Sandy Hook curves, Nos. 4 and 5, (Sketch No. 19,) are among the best of the type curves of temperature at the same depth, though among the earliest determined. The overflow of the Gnlf Stream into the long spur occupied by the cold current between it and the shore, mixing in a degree with the cold water, is well shown by the curves (a, b, and c) at the surface, 5 and 10 fathoms, and the still greater admixture with the cold water at 20, 30, and 50 fathoms, (d, e, f.) , The whole space from the shore to 240 miles is occupied, however, with comparatively cold water. Then is met the sndden rise to the Gulf Stream, shown especially below 50 fathoms, and termed so appropriately by Lieut. Geo. M. Bache the "cold wall," that navi· gators have not hesitated to receive the term into 11se. Next the hot water of the Gulf Stream, rising to a maximum of 82°, then falling to a minimum of 80°, rising to a second maximum of 81 ! 0 , falling to a second minimum of "Z8°, and rising from this towards a third maximum. With these results the curves at 5 and 10 fathoms, and those at 20, 30, 50, 70, 100, and 150 fathoms, agree, and with characteristic differences those of 200, 300, 400, and 50-0 fathoms. The co1d wall at 20 fathoms shows a rise of 19° in 25 miles, three-quarters of a degree to a mile, and at 200 fathoms of 16° in the same distance. At the surface it is noo.rly 8° in 60 miles. The cold water between the Gulf Stream and the shore has two well-marked maxima and two minima in it, of which one seems to correspond in position to the sudden deepening of

he water 100 miles from Sandy Hook, as shown by the Coast Survey off-shore chart between Gay Head and Cape Henlopen. These results are more distinctly seen by grouping the curves into natural groups and taking the mean of t11eir indications. Diagram No. 5 (Sketch No. 19) gives the group of six curves from the surface to 30 fathoms, of four curves from 40 to 100 fathoms, both inclusive, of 200, 300, and the single curve at 400 fathoms. Similar groups are shown on Diagram No. 6 (Sketch No. 19) from Cape Henry, the cold wall, three maxima of temperature and three miuima being very distinctly seen. The results of three different explorations of this section by three different officers in three different years are shown upon the same diagram. The coincidence of resu 1 t could hardly be better. The average of the whole of the observations is shown on No. 6 bis, (Sketch ~o. 19.) The cold wall here gives a change of 22~ 0 in 50 miles from the curves between 0 and 30 fathoms, and 13° in 50 miles in the mean of 200, 300, and 400 fathoms. The average of the three years comes out beautifully on Diagram No. 6 bis, (Sketch No. 19.) The Charleston curves are shown upon No. 7, (Sketch No. Hl.) They are less regular than those just given, for reasons which will appear when I come to speak of the second class of diagrams. The conclusions deduced from the examination of all the sections between Cape Florida and Sandy Hook is, that the Gulf Stream is divided into alternate bands of hot or warm and cool or cold water, the most distinct of which is that containing the axis of the Gulf Stream. That between the stream and the coast there is a fall of temperature so sudden that it has been aptly called the cold wall, less distinct at the surface, and when the overflow from the Gulf Stream passes furthest towards the shore, but still distinctly marked even at the surface. Navigators have noticed t.hose changes of temperature, and have supposed themselves at each occurrence of warmer water to be in the hottest water of the stream, and so have been greatly embarrassed,:and have deemed the plwnomena and limits of the Gulf Stream to be very irregular. The cold water between the Gulf Stream and tho shore has also bands less regular than those beyond the axis of warmer and cooler water. The intrusive cool water in the Gulf Stream on the Sandy Hook section was distinctly recog· nized in 1846 by Lieut. Geo. M .. Bache, who, from the facts observed, supposed it to represent a division of the warm water of the stream into two branches. Passing through the Straits of Florida, between the" keys and reefs and the coast of Cuba, we have, after going beyond Cape Florida, a different type curve. The cold wall is less distinctly marked, and the rise of temperature is less marked. It rises, however, to an axis near the coast of Cuba. Throughout the length of the strait there is but one maximum of tempera· ture, and the bands belonging to the .Atlantic regimen do not occur in the straits.-(See Diagrams Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, Sketch No. 20.) The cause of this change of regimen will be seen in presenting the other form of diagram. (b.) Curves of depths at the same temperature.-! have selected curves from the southern portions of the work partly because the bottom has been sti·uck in the sections, and the diagram shows its sections as well as those of the stream, and partly to show how fully the deductions in regard to the divisions of the stream apply to these as well as to the more northern sections. The Charleston section of Lieut. Maffitt is given on Diagram No. 9, Sketch No. 19. The surface curve, notwithstanding the disturbance by a storm, shows the cold wall, (see also Diagram No. 7,) the ax.is and two other maxima; the corresponding minima, a maximum within the cold current, which is not, therefore, as has been empposed, cut off at Hatteras, the curve of 72° reaching to the coast, and 770 nearly reaching it. The Cape Florida diagrams (Nos·. 3 and 7, Sketch No. 20) give two.maxima, with indications of a third, and the corresponding minima.. The oold wall cannot be recognized upon it probably for the want of one or two more positions. The form of the bottom delineated on these two sections, namely, the Charleston and Cape Florida seetions, is remark.able, and appli~s to the sections between them as far a.s explored.

172

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

First is a geiJtle slope; then a sudden descent; a second steep pitch to a considerable depth; a range of hills; a valley, and a second range. '.fhe correspondence of these features with the bands of temperature is plainly marked. The cold water lies in the valleys, and passing along the Lottom rises upon the tops of the hills. The discovery of this range of hills was made at nearly the same time by Lieut. Maffitt on the Charleston section, and by Lieut. Craven on the St. Simon's section. Diagram No. 9, Sketch No. 19, shows this connection in a very striking manner, as does also No. 7, Sketch No. 20, and the figure of the bottom of the Straits of Florida shows why there are no bands formed p~ior to ·, passing Cape Florida: in other words, why the regimen of the stream is different in the straits and in the Atlantic. In the straits we see (No. 9, Sketch No. 20) that after leaving the United States shore, and the comparatively flat surface extending to the reef, there is a rapid descent towards the Cuban side of the strait, the axis of the Gulf Stream being found in the deep hollow of that side of tlie strait. These results, with a more elaborate discussion of them, were presented at the last meeting of the Association. It would seem from the configuration of the bottom that the cold stream at the bottom of the Straits of Florida divides, one portion passing to the north and west into the Gulf of Mexico, and the other around the western end of the Island of Cuba. 'l'hat the polar stream still occupies the bottom of the strait is shown by temperature of 35° Fahr. being reached at 600 fathoms from the surface off Havana. Do these bands correspond throughout their length to the form of the bottom of the sea? 'l'his is not yet made out, many as have been the attempts to reach the considerable depths off the more uortheru sections. Three officers have attempted to sound out the Cape Cod section, but the cold wall is all that has been reached thus far. Tho range of hills nearest the coast has been traced from the coast of Georgia, by Commander Sands, to off Cape Lookout. 3. The cold wall.-The cold wall extends, with varying dimensions and changes of its peculiar features, all along the coast where the stream has been examined. A diagram showing the features of the cold wall on the various Atlantic sections, and those of the Strait~ of Florida, is given in No. 10, Sketch No. 19; and Table No. 1 shows the distance of the cold wall from the coast, and the dimensions of the Atlantic bands of the Gulf Stream.

The table shows that at Cape Florida and Cape Hatteras the cold wall is nearest to the coast. The distance of the axis of the stream from its coast will be found by adding half the numbers in the second column to those in the first column. It is obvious from these numbers, when taken in connection with the longitudes of the points where the sections originate, that the earth's motion is not the sole determining cause of the direction of the axis of the stream, a result which a more elaborate investigation of the movements from parallel to parallel confirms. In the portions of its course between Cape Florida and Mosquito inlet (3!;<=' of latitude) the curve is actually slightly to the westward. The table shows a width in the Gulf Stream proper along the Atlantic coast of from 25 miles off Cape Florida to 127 miles off Sandy Ilook. The warm water at, say, fifteen fathoms varies from 30 to 150 miles in width. 'l'he stream widens each way from Cape Florida. The;,;e several divisions of the Atlantic stream lose a portion of their distinctness as we pass northward and eastward, the stream widening.

V.

LIMIT OF ACCURACY OF THE DETERMINATIONS.

There are two modes by which the limits of accuracy of these results may be tested, by one of which their permanency is also tried. In this latter mode the sections are run over in different years, or in the same year, by different officers, so as to connect the observations of one year with those of the next, or of one officer with those of another. Table No. II shows that the relative results are reproduced from year to year with less variability than those of the mean temperature of the section, and hence the permanency of the bands, and the possibility of observing them with the requisite precision must be admitted. On the Cape Henry section, which was explored three times, the position of the cold wall and of the axis of the stream were reproduced within 5! miles, aud those of the succeeding points of maximum and minimum temperatures within 7! miles. As the positions at sea are liable to an uncertainty of some three to five miles, it must be admitted that the permanency of the bands and the accuracy of the observations of them are fully found. The Cape Henry section was run over by Lieuts. George M. Bache, S, P. Lee, and Richard Bache; the Hatteras section by Lieut.s. Richard Bache and J. N. Maffitt; and the Charleston section by I~ieuts.

The other mode of testing the result is by the comparison of the remarkable points in the different sections, each one belonging to a different position, and therefore being entirely independent of the other in its determination. It is established as a general law that this cold wall and axis of the hottest water change their position from the surface to the depth of six hundred fathoms slowly and by an ascertained progression, and that the succeeding maximum and minimum points arc at the same distance from the shore, nearly, at different depths, or in a vertical line at all the different depths. The positions of these points, as ohown by the observations at different depths, became thus the test of the permanency of their positions and of the accuracy with which they have been ascertained. The Table III gives the probable error of the mean of the determinations of each point including the cold wall minimum, the axis maximum, and the successive minima and maxima to the fourth minimum, inclusive. These results show that the cold wall minimum is ascertained, on the average, within 0. 83 mile, the axis maximum within two miles and a half; the second minimum within two miles and a half; the second maximum and the third minimum, and third maximum, within four miles; and the fourth maximum within eight and a half miles; all being satisfactory except the last, which, of course, is in reality loosely defined. The Hatteras result for the axis of the stream makes the probable error considerably larger than it would otherwise be, probably from the fact that the proximity of the bottom of the sea makes the result less permanent than in the ot1ier cases. Without this result the mean probable error would be 1.1 mile.

While these results are so permanent the mean temperatures of the sections change considerably from year to year. 'l'he average temperature between the surface and 400 fathoms beyond, or outRide of the cold wall on the Sandy Hook section in 1846, was as hig·h as that on the Cape Henry section in 1848, and that on the Cape Fear section in 1853, and within a degree of that of the St. Augustine section in 1853, while the Cape Hatteras section in 1848 and 1853 differed two degrees in mean temperatures. Again, the temperatures from the surface to 30 fathoms just below the axis of the stream in the Sandy Hook section in Augm;t, 1846, was either as high as or higher than those on the Canaveral section in June, 1853. In general, the Cape May section in 1846, and the mean of the Cape Henry sections of 1846, 1847, and 1848, are warmer at the same depths than the sections south of it were in 1848 and 1853. These results show that there are great changes in temperature from year to year, and probably from season to season. Some progress has been made in connecting these results in a general way with the changes. of weather in the Gulf of Mexico. The depth at which the results are easily determined, and where they are characteristic and as permanent as the phenomena permit, is thirty fathoms.

FIGURE OF THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA BELOW THE GULF STREAM.

We have seeu that in cross section there is a great re11emblance in the bottom of the sea off our coast to the region of land more removed from the coast line in the interior. The top of the first range of hills (see Diagram No. 9, Sketch No. 19) is 1,500 feet above the valley to the eastward of it, distant 12 miles, and the top of the second range 600 feet above the same valley, distant 15 miles. The first slope is 125 feet and the second is 40 feet to the mile. The bottom of the sea from the Tortugas section to that of Cape Florida rises from 800 to 325 fathoms, a.nd from the same point descends in passing northward and eastward. The Cape Florida. section should then present a ridge of comparatively cold water, since the division into

1'76

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

bands should app1y along the stream as well as in the direction of its cross sections. The temperature of 40° is in fact reached on that section at 300 fathoms, and, as well as can be judged from the results in t.he separate sections, there are divisions of this sort. The diagram (No. 2, Sketch No. 20) shows whera the curve of 50° and 45° are found upon the different sections, and indicates a rise on the Charleston section and a sharp descent from Charleston to Cape Fear.

VII.

GENERAL FE.A.TURES OF THE GULP STREAM.

Upon the general diagram now presented to the members (see Sketch No. 21) the general features of the Gulf Stream are represented from the Tortugas to the Cape Cod section. Passing along the Cuban coast, the temperature in June was found to be about 84°, or 8° above the mean temperature of Key West, as given by the surgeon general's report. The current here is feeble, but sufficient to cause it to be sought by sailing vesse1s working to windward, and even by steamers. Issuing from the Straits of Bernini, the stream is turned northward by the land, which confines and directs its course. Its effective velocity is not derived from difference of temperatures, as the observations abundantly show, the greatest relative differences being, in fact, crosswise of the stream. The direction is here a little west of north, and the velocity is from three to five miles per hour. The temperature bands now begin. The bottom of the sea, which was one slope and counter slope across the Florida straits, is here corrugated. The depth, instead of being unfathomable, as has heretofore been supposed, is but 325 fathoms, in which the two currents from the poles at the bottom and from the Gulf at the top must pass each other; while the surface water is above 80°, that near the bottom is as low as 40°. The stream just north of Mosquito inlet begins to bend to the eastward of north, and off St. Augustine has a decided set to the eastward. While flowing thus onward the warm water seeks the sides of the channel overflowing towards the coast of Florida and towards the Bahamafi, but not as rapidly as it leaves the north. Between St. Augustine and Cape Hatteras the set of the strflam and the trend of the coast differ but little, making five degrees of easting in five degrees of northing. At Hatteras it curves to the northward, and then runs easterly, making about three degrees of northing in three of easting. In the latitude of Cape Charles it turns quite to the eastward, having a velocity of one and one mile and a half the hour. That this curve follows the general sweep of the coast under water appears most probable; the coast line, the curve of 100 fathoms, and the ranges of hills discovered by Lieuts. Maffitt and Craven all seem to indicate it. That the direction of the stream is given in a general way by the configuration of the bottom of the sea it is hardly possible to doubt, while admitting that it receives modification from other and perhaps more general causes. The after progress of this mighty stream, and of its branches if it does divide, remain yet to be traced, and so also its heading in the Gulf of Mexico. I forbear to mingle doubtful speculation upon causes with the inductions in regard to temperature which it has been the object of these observations to supply~ and of this lecture to bring to your notice.

APPENDIX No. 18.
Report i<> the Superintendent by Assistant L. F. Pourta"lcs, in charge <if thefirdd and qffice work, rilating to tidal observations.
Co.AST SURVEY OFFICE, October 1, 1860. Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field and office work performed by the tidal party under my charge during the past year. Field·teork.-The permanent stations at which the tides have been observed for a long period are the same as in former years: Boston, New York, Old Point Comfort, Charleston, and Fort Clinch, Fla., on the .Atlantic coast, and San Diego, Sau Francisco, and Astoria, on the Pacific coast. To these may be added Eastport, Me., and Tortugas and Pensacola, Florida, which, although not intended to be kept up as long as the other permanent statious, will still be in operation for several years. These statiom1 are all supplied with self-registering tide·gauges, with the exception of the one in Boston. The results obtained have generally been satisfactory. 'l'he most complete sets are those of Boston, Tortugas, San Diego, San Francisco, and Astoria. At the other places the interruptions to the series are chiefly to be attributed to the insufficient stability of the wharves on which the clocks of the gauges rest. Experiments have been directed to try the efl:'ect of placing the self-registering apparatus on solid land, and to communicate with the float-box by means of a wire enclosed in a tube. The results have not yet been reported. Heretofore the self-registering observations were found impracticable at the northern ports during the winter, on account of ice forming in the float·box. At the suggestion of Assistant H. Mitchell, the gauge at Eastport was kept at work suc.:cessfully by covering the surface of the water in the float-box with a layer of a few inches of kerosene oil. This expedient will be applied next winter at all the stations at which it may be necessary. An improvement, first suggested by Mr. S. Walker, has been int.roduced by Mr. Saxton in the last tide-gauge constructed. It consists in making the part of the receiving l:tnd delivering rollers on which the cords of the weights are wound of a conical form, so that the power of the weight on the receiving roller increases as the paper accumulates on it, and decreases on the delivering roller as its effective diameter diminishes by the delivery of the paper. The same weight operates both rollers. The stations on the Western Coast have been contin~ed under the efficient supervision of Lieut. G. H. Elliot, U. S. Engineers. Of temporary stations, the one at the Washington navy yard is still in operation, under the charge of Mr. Donn, of this division. The series is quite sufficient fo1· ordinary purposes, but the gauge is sometimes found of use in training new observers. After Mr. Wiirdemann's death the charge of the stations in the Gulf of Mexico was intrusted to Mr. A. C. Mitchell. His first action, under your instructions, was to remove the tide-gauges from Charlotte harbor, Egmont key, and Cedar keys, Florida, and to establish four new stations at St. Mark's entrance, Dog island, Cape St. George, and St. Vincent's island, (west entrance to St. George's sound.) They were set up near to each other for the purpose of investigating the change from the semi-diurnal to thB diurnal type, which occurs in that region. After a few months it was found that the stations at Dog island and Cape St. George might be dispensed with, as the change from one type to the other was very gradual. Those two gauges ha.ve therefore boon removed lately to the Southwest Pass of the .Mississippi and to Last island, on the coast of Louisiana. The performance of those gauges has been quite satisfactory. Wear~ again indebted to S. T. Abert, esq., civil engineer of the Warrington navy yard, for another year of excellent self-registering observations, taken at that place under his <ltU'e. 2S c

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

A self-regfotering tide-gauge established at Cape San Lucas, Lower California, by Mr. Xantus, under the direction of Lieut. E!liot, has labored unoer great difficulties from the unfavorable location at which it was first erected. The water was not deep enough, and the float-box was sanded up at every gale. The low waters observed are therefore very defective. The uncertainty and slowness of correspondence with the observer made it very difficult to remedy the evil. This gauge has lately been reset in a more favorable location. All the tidal stations had, at the beginning of the year, their sets of meteorological instruments made more complete. Plottings of the observations have been communicated to the meteorological department of the British Board of Trade. I would especially call your attention to the very full set of observations furnished by Mr. Wilson, the observer at Astoria, Oregon. The following table contains a list of the observations received during the year. The tidal observations taken by hydrographic parties for the reduction of soundings arc not included;

Rodgers, U. S. N., some years ago. He was also occupied in reducing the decomposed tides from the stations on the coast of Florida, and other miseellaneous duties. During the period of my absence from the office last summer he bad charge of this division. The le.rg-e amount of work required to bring up to date the graphical decomposition of the tides observed on the coast of Florida and to keep pace with the observations, has engaged the whole time of Messrs. Downes, Balmain, and J. R. Gilliss, with occasional help from others. The set, " Cape Florida, Indian Key, Key West, and Tortugas," was finished several months agD. The set, "Tortugas, Charlotte Harbor, Egmont Key, and Cedar Keys," is nearly finished, and the set from the new stations now occupied is but little behind the observations. Mr. Downes made also the plottings of meteorological observations alluded to ahove. Mr. J. W. Donn has· attended to the reading off of the sheets from the self-registering tidegauges, except those of the Western Coast, which were read off in San Francisco by H. E. Uhrlandt. Mr. Dorm has also kept the register of tl1e observations, received and acknowledged the receipt to the observers, and, besides, has had charge of the self-registering tide-gauge at the Washington navy yard. Most of the ordinary reductions have been made by M. Thomas and S. D. Pendleton. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. COAST SURVEY OFFICE, October 4, 1860. DEAR Sm : In conformity with the regulations which require the Assistant in charge of the office to present to the Superintendent of the Coast Survey an annual report of the operations and progress of the work executed in this office, I have the honor to submit the following report: The duties of each division of the office, and the occupations of each employe, are fully shown in the accompanying sub-reports of the chiefs of divisions. The office-work of the survey, having for its object the highly important part of reducing the work of the field parties to the forms necessary to bring the results within the reach of the public in the shape of finished charts, &c., of the most accurate and reliable character, its organization, dnties, and labors, have always demanded and received constant care and watchfulness. As new discoveries are made, new facilities afforded, from whatever 8ources they may be derived, it is essential that they he rendered available whenever the interests of the 1mrvey are th~reby advanced, especially when rapidity of execution, increased economy, and accuracy

can be attained. · In the Computing Division the highest mathematical talent is requisite, in order to reduce, by the niost approved methods, the geodetic observations upon which the d1arts are based. In the Drawing Divisiou years of experience and special qualifications have always been
required for the accurate and minute delineations necessary for the use of the engraver. The

Superintendent is aware of the great difficulty of obtaining first class engravers. The care bestowed upon the critfoal examination of their labors demands and receives unwearied atten~ion; the great ~p~nse of engraving, in the best style of the a.rt, is also well known; and had It not been for the discovery of the electrotype process, and its prompt introduction and

10

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

improvement in the Coast Survey office, the annual expense of engraving would have rendered it impossible to have produced more than a. small .proportion of the finished charts that have been issued within the last few years. Especial attention has now been devoted, for more than a year past, to imp:roving the process of reducing the original field sheets by means of photography, in order to insure further rapidity, economy, and accuracy in the work of the Drawing and Engraving Divisions. It was for a long time doubtful whether photography could be successfully applied in reducing original drawings from a large, such as a Tlf~oo. to a smaller, as an -8 0 ~ 0 0 scale, the photograph. preserving at the same time the just proportions and distinctness oft.he original. These doubts ' have, after much labor and study, been entirely removed; and thus the means have been found by which a very great saving of time and labor may be effected. He~etofore these laborious reductions have been made by hand, requiring months of labor on the part of the most skilful draughtsman, to produce results which are now effected with greater accuracy in a few days. It might be supposed that the reduced drawing thus obtained at comparatively small labor and expense was now complete, and could be placed at once in the hands of the engraver, thus securing at one operation the advantages that have been referred to; but it was soon seen that the labors of the engraver might be lessened and facilitated by resorting to a modified system, which it may be well to explain in detail. In the process of engraving from a finished drawing by hand reduction much time is consumed in determining and selecting the true outlines; in this a sound judgment and considernble acquaintance with and knowledge of all topographical features is required; and even when an engraver possesses these qualifica· tions there is a great probability of some errors occurring from the confusion occasion~d by such a mass of minute details. The modified practice now adopted is to make in the Drawing Division a tracing of the general outlines of the original sheet; this tracing is sent to the Photogrnphic Division, where three photographs are taken, two on the reduced scale required, one of them upon glass, the other upon paper ; the third photograph is made upon paper of double the scale of the other two, to enable the engraver to see more readily and distinctly the topographical details. The photographs arc returned to the Drawing Division, the first merely for veritication; which done, it is sent to the Engraving Divi8ion, when every line, as it is seen in the reduction, is at once entered in the copper; thus far the work of the engraver is almost a merely mechanical process. Upon the two paper photographs the topographical features are represented in the Drawing Division by conventional colors, in accordance with special rules. The colored photographs, after having been verifieci, a1·e taken to the engraver, who fills in the outlines already engraved by following strictly the topographical features rep· .resented by the colors; as it is necessary in this process to use a separate system uf signs applicable to the engraver's art for representing these different topographical features; he is furnished with samples of each feature, in accordance with the special rules adopted by the Superintendent. Here again a saving of labor is effected; for by the former system the draughtsman was obliged to fill in the whole she-et with these topographical details, the engraver merely making a copy of the drawing, and constantly repeating the identical strokeB of the pen of t.he draughtsman; this double work is now avoided, as is clearly seen. l present the fore· going as a general sketch, or explanation of tlte process now used; va.riati9mJ from this system are necessary in some particular C$\ses, as when the different features change wddenly, or when the locality is one of complex contour, when, in addition t-0 the ooloring, the proper conventional signs, the hachuring of the hills, kc., must be indicated upon the photographic print, by pen-work in ink, to prevent confusion or mistake, and further facilitate t1w l·bor of the engraver. The advantages of the use of photography in thisuftiee1 a.sI have described it, a.re three.-fold: First.

The experience already gained shows conclusively that a great saving of time resnlts from this process. Formerly the engraving of the chart was often delayed until the finished drawing was completed, whereas now the engraver may begin his 'vork the moment the outline of a single field sheet is given to him; other parts will always be finished before he is ready to commence upon them. The want of facilities like these, and the fear of incurring too great an expense, have been the chief reasons why the Engraving Division has always been so much in arrears; and in order to bring up the back work, it is a measure of true economy to at once increase and strengthen this important division of the office. The value of the maps is enhanced, in my judgment, if they are given to the world in the least possible time (compatible with the requisite accuracy) after the field-work has been completed. I do not think sufficient data exist to enable me to gi·ve a11ything like an accurate estimate in figures of the amount of money saved by mea11s of photography. It is estimated in the office , at about 33 per cent. upon the expenditures of the Drawing and Engraving Divisions; but the proceases have not been long enough in operation to enable me to verify this. I am certain that the same annual expenditure in the Drawing and Engraving Divisions enables the office to complete the maps at least 33 per cent. faster than heretofore. The Engraving Division should, I think, be increased at this time to an extent which would insure the completion of our first class charts, &c., in one-half the time they have heretofore required; and this can be accomplished by the addition of two more first class engravers. I therefore re8pectful1y recommend that immediate steps be taken to secure the services of two engravers possessed of the necessary qualifications. <At the date of my last report, (October 1, 1859,) First Lieutenant J. R. Smead, 2d artillery, was assigned to the charge of the Engraving Division; he also conti\;lued in charge of the Mis· celhmeous Division for the larger portion of the year. First Lieutenant N. H. McLean, 2d infantry, joined this office in March last, having succeeded to the vacancy occasioned by the detachment of First Lieutenant J. P. Roy, 2d infantry, from duty on United States Coast Survey; and after acquiring some general knowledge of th"l office duties, has now been assigned to the charge of the Miscellaneous Division. The different divisions of the office will now be referred to in general terms. Oomp'lll,ing Division.-This division remains under the charge of Assistant C. A. Schott. He has been assisted in the labors of the division by Assistant T. W. Werner, Messrs. E. Nulty, J. Main, G. Rumpf, J. Wiessner, and W. D. Starke, as regular computers; Mr . .T. H. Patton performing the duty of clerk. Assistant A. S. Wadsworth, Mr. B. H. Todd, and R. Freeman have also been temporarily employed in the division. Tid.al Divi.mm.-Assistant L. JI'. Pourtales has continued in charge of this division. His special report11 on the progress of the tidal reductions and discussions are made directly to the Superintendent. Messrs. R. S. Avery, John Downes, T. W. Donn, and Charles Balmain have bee& employed as regular computers in this division ; )fr. Pourtales has also occasionally received ~id from other employes on the survey during the iutervals of their field duties, as is stated in his report, hereto appended. Drawing Diviili<m.-First Lieutenant Thomas Wilson, 5th infantry, bas been in charge thr0ttgbout the ycea:r. It is with great regret that I make known officially to the Superintendent the death, on the &th t>f August last, of A88istant W. )f. C. Fairfax, late senior draughtsman in this division. Bia ·>dt1&dlepo:rtment &nd his many private virtues endeared him to all who had the ple'asure ofaiscBCEtuaietanetk .. His aeqtlirementa in his profession were of the highest ortler. He had heen ~cted. with, the Ooast Survey since 1843, and the vacancy occasioned by his loss cannot

be easily filled. Lieutenant Wilson alludes to his death, and the loss the Drawing Division has sustained thereby, in appropriate terms. I would refer to his interesting repott for more detailed information in relation to the duties of this division. Engraving Division.-First Lieutenant J. R. Smead, 2d artillery, formerly in charge of the Miilce11aneous Division, was, at the date of my last annual report, transferred, as before mentioned, to the more important charge of the Engraving Division. I have already stated, somewhat in detail, the improvements adopted, and in progress, by means of the successful application of photography in the reductions, and alluded to the necessity of adding to the force of this division. The Superintendent will perceive, from Lieutenant Smead' s detailed report, that this division has made very satisfactory progress under his judicious management. It is my painful duty to announce to the Superintendent that this division has also met with a serious loss by the death of Mr. J. Y. N. Throop, a first-class engraver, who died on the 3d of July last. He had been attached to the Engraving Division for more than six years. He possessed great merit and experience, and particularly excelled as a letter engraver. Electrotype and Photographic Division.-This division, in which some of the most interesting and useful results to the Survey have been produced, still remains under the charge of Mr.· George Mathiot. Mr. Mathiot has been assisted by Mr. D. Hinkle, of whom he speaks, in bis report, in the highest terms. Mr. Hinkle has been zoalous and active in prosecuting the experiments for the photographic reduction of maps. These experiments, the result of which I have alluded to in the first part of this report, have involved much labor and study, while, at the same time, the current work of electrotyping has not been neglected. Fifty-one plates have been electrotyped during the year-nineteen in alto, and thirty-two in basso. One plate has been extended in size, and four plates electrotyped for other &epartments of the government, and fifty-four plane-table sheets have been reduced by photography. The engraving of these, from the time gained, is nearly finished. It is therefore apparent that the useful results which I confidently anticipated at the date of my last report have already been realized. Experiments will be continued for bringing, if possible, into successful use the photolithographic process, which I have reason to hope will soon be found advantageous for the more rapid publication of our coarser charts and sketches· .A.rcltivc8 and library.-Eight hundred and four volumes of original and duplicate records, and sixty-three original tl)pographical and hydrographical sheets have been added to the archives of the Survey during the past year. Eighty.four volumes have been purchased for the library, and ninety added by presentation during the same period. I would respectfully call tho attention of the Superintendent to the necessity of providing increased accommodation for the preservation of the archives and valuable engraved plates. Constant additions have so completely filled the limited space available that it is very difficult at this time to preserve the archives in the order that they should be to render them. aooes· sihle to those who wish to examine the records. MiJroellaneoua Division.-To the .:.:hief of this division is iutrnsted the charge of the printing of the maps and charts of the Survey, and also their distribution, and that of the annual report of the Superinteudent. First Lieutenant N. H. McLean, 2d infantl'y, has been recently assigned to this duty. The number of impressions taken by the printer, and the distribution of the ·maps, eharts, and Coast Survey reports, are shown by Lieutenant J. R. Smead in his report. Carpentry.-In the carpenters' s.hop Mr. A! Yeatman remains in charge wi mastt>r carpenter, assisted by two workmen. The work has beeb. perffil"med in the usual aa~ry f.111lDDr. There have heel\ made during the year various ·Btand.ii aftd ··case& for instmments, ~ve19' tables, wood-work for self-registering tide-gauges, d:r&wing board.a, ·.casea fm.-:map.&'tmd ree01'd&1

cylinder cases for magnetic clocks, implements for photographic purposes, packing boxes for instruments, the necessary repairs to instruments and Coast Survey buildings, and, in addition, a large amount of miscellanous work. Instrument slmp"-The force in this shop consists of Mr. J. Yierbuchen, master instrument maker, five workmen, and one apprentice. During the year 21 instruments for geodetic work, 21 for astronomical, 5 for magnetic and telegraphic, Hi for hydrographic, 18 for drawing, 91 for engraving, and 26 topogrnphical instruments have been made, and 84 geodetic, 8 astronomical, 6 magnetic and telegraphic, 39 hydrographic, 25 drawing, 14 engraving, aud 46 topographical instruments have been repaired, in addilion to a variety of miscellaneous work for the use of the office and parties in the field. Please find submitted, also, the report of duties performed in the Hydrographic Division, during the past year, under the direction of Commander S. S. Lee, U. S. navy, hydro6raphic inspector, and furnished to this office. In conclusion, I would tender my thanks to Com. S. S. Lee and Lieutenant 8. Bent, U. S. navy; ProfessorW. P. Trowbridge, .Assistant in the Coast Survey; Samnel Hein, esq., general disbursing agent; and Joseph Saxton, esq., assistant in weights and measures, for the aid they have given to this office on frequent occasions. First Lieutenant .A. P. Hill, 1st artillery, U.S. army, continues as general assistant. His experience, capacity, and knowledge of the duties of this office are well known to tLe Superintendent. I beg leave to repeat my statement of iast year, that the clerical force of this office is, in my judgment, entitled to an increase of compensation. Their duties, I am confident, are quite as onerous as those of the clerks in other bureaus of the government; yet they receive a much lower compensation. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Repm·t Qf Lieut. Silas Bent, U. S. N., on the details qf occupation in the Hydmgraphic Division of the Ooast Survey <;/fie". WASHINGTON CITY, October 1, 1860. Since joining this office in March last the general hydrographic duties have been under my supervision, and have consisted chiefly of the examination and verification of original hydrographic sheets, as they have been turned in by the parties afloat, together with the angle and sounding books belonging to those surveys; the examination of the sheets reduced for pub1ication and the plotting upon them of the light-houses, light-vessels, beacons, and buoys, as determiaed by our own parties in the field, or from data furnished by the J_,ight-house Board; the making or revising of sailing directions and sailing lines; the description of dangers and plotting of mid-channel, tidal, and current stations, and the results of the observations taken at them. Upon these Mr . .Arthur Balhach has been generally engaged as draughtsman; in addition to which, however, h"8 has been subject to constant calls to supply informatiQn required from the office1 which his long experience on the survey has made him particularJy familiar with; the correction of buoys on published charts and the examination of proofs from newly engmved charts, &c., &c. Mr. L. Karcher, draughtsman, was transferred to this division in the latter part of April. He has since been employed in making projections for the hydrographic parties; comparative tracing· of various localities, of which two or more surveys have been made, w as to exhibit the changes that may have occurred; the plotting of supplementary work furnished from the field; replotting work originally made in advance of the astronomical determina~ons, &c., &c.. Mr. W. B. McMurtrie, draughtsman, reported for duty temporarily in this division in .August,

Report of Assistant Charles A.. Schott, in charge of the Computing DiviBion.
Co.a.ST SURVEY OFFICE, Ociobe1· 1, 1860. In conformity with the regulations of the office, I herewith respectfully submit the annual

report on the work done by the various computers for the year ending October 1, 1860. The general organization of the division has not been changed, and it has proved, as in former years, effective and sufficient to meet all requirements. The number of computers remain nearly as before, the present force barely sufficing to keep up all the routine computa tions. The revision of the astronomical and magnetic work is in a very forward state, and the geodetic computations are as far advanced as the present state of the field-work admits. With an assistant the daily observation of the sun's disk (weather permitting) for number and position of the solar spots has been kept up regularly since the beginning of the year. During my absence from the office on a magnetic survey in Sections I, II, and III, between August 1 and September 26, Mr. James Main took charge of the division. Mr. John Wiessner was re-assigned as computer under date of August 20. Mr. William D. Storke having been ordered to field duty, Mr. B. H. Todd was appointed on the 17th of January to supply his place. Mr. J. T. Hoover, who had been clerk to the division for several years, was transferred to your office, and his place was filled by Mr. J. H. Patton, who reported for duty on November 28, 1859. Assistant A. S. Wadsworth has temporarily assisted in the reduction of magnetic and astronomical observations. He has been thus engaged since the first week of June, and also accompanied me on the magnetic survey in August and Sept.ember. Sub-Assistant C. Fendall has also been engaged on astronomical work since the middle of July. The work done by each computer during the year will appear from the following detailed statement: A.Bllistant Theodore W. Werner reduced Assistant Davidson's triangulation of San Francisco; a part of the Santa Rosa triangulation, Section VII; the triangulation of Damariscotta river and Penobscot bay; of Espiritu Santo bay and vicinity, 1859; of the Gulf of Georgia, W. T., 1859; the triangulation on the Mississippi delta, 1859; of Isle au Breton sound; of Charlotte harbor, and of Santa Cruz island. He also made a preliminary reduction of the Chatham bay triangulation, and reduced the horizontal angles observed at Station Humpback; made part of the reducti-0n of the horizontal angles observeri at Howard, Western Ridge, and Cqamcook; tabulated Assistant Davidson's horizontal and vertical angles at Sulphur Peak; made an abstract of the angles at Ross mountain, and a new reduction of the azimuth at Station Yard, and completed the reduction of the secondary triangulation south of Cedar Keys. . Mr. Eugene NuUy reduced the azimuth ob.served at Table Mount, Cal. i the observations for time, latitude, and azimuth made at Port Royal, 1859; the observations for latitude and azimuth at Howard; the observations for time, latitude, and azimuth at Sulphur Peak; the azimuth at East Base, (Edisto;) the observations for latitude and azimuth at Apalachicola, and the azimuth and latitude at Ross mountain, Section X. Mr. Jam.es Main revised the reductions of ob$ervations for latitude at Statio.llB Smithville, Howard, Calais, Mount Rose, and Apalachicola; revised the reductions of observations for azimuth at Smithville, Mount Desert, Port Royal, Howaril, East Ba.ae, Edisto, Sava.nnah Exchange, Humpback, :Mount Rose, Apalachicola., Cat island, Lower Kissisaippi, and. ltast Base,

(Galveston island.) He also made a second reduction of the magnetic observations at Port Royal, Smithville, Wes tern Ridge, Howard, and Cl1,nncook, an cl reduced tho occnltations observed at Point Hudson, W. T., for longitude, and has been engaged in various other astro· nomical computations. Mr. Gottlieb Rumpf revised the triangulation of Cape Fear; Teduced tho triangulation near St. Augustine, and the horizontal angles in connection with the Port Royal azimuth; revised the triangulation of Muscongus bay and mouth of the Penobscot; tbo triang.:111:-ttion of San Antonio and Copano bays, and those of St. Simon's and Sapelo .sounds, and the triangulation of the Gulf of Georgia, W. T. He also revised Assistant Farley's triangulation of the mouth of James river, 1859; reduced the additional triangulation of Beaufort river; rnYi><e<l the triangulation of the :Mississippi delta; made an adjustmeuL of the triangulation of tlie James and Appomattox riven;; reduced the Hudson river triangulation; made a preliminary adjustment of the primary triangulation near Epping base; rel1uced part of the triangulation south of Cedar Keys; made out the horizontal angles of Assi,.;tant lloutclle's primary triangulation in Section V, and attended to tho insertion of gec1graphicaJ positions in the registers. Mr. Jolin Wicssner reported for duty August 20, and has been engaged in the completion of the adjustment by least squares of the primary triangulation between Kent Island base and Washington; also in making miscellaneous geodetic computations, and in the reduction of tho primary triangulation in Section V. Mr. Williarn D. Starke, reduced the triangulation from HomosaRsa river to Raccoon Point, Section VII, and the triangulation of Cote Blanche bay, 181i9. He was transferre<l to a field party December 8, and again reported for duty July 16, 18GO, after which he re<luced the horizontal angles observed at Howard and Western Ridge, and partially reduced the triangulation south of Cedar Keys. He also attended to clerical duties. 2Jir. B. H. Todd reported for duty January 17, and assisted in reducing the triangulation of St. Simon's sound and in the reduction of star places for the latitude of Port Royal. He also made a second reduction of the additional triangulation in Section III; reduced the triangulation of Crescent City, Cal.; assisted in reducing the triangulation of the James and Appo· mattox rivers, and the additional triaugulation in Section II and Section V. Ile wus trans· ferred to a field party August 20, and again reported for duty September G, and has since been occupied in clerical duties. Mr. John T. Hoover attended to the clerical dutie" of the division, and assisted in the preparation of the geographical positions for the Superintendent's report of 1859. He was detached from the division November 23. Mr. J. Houston Patton reported for duty November 28, and has attended to the clerical duty of the division, besides assisting in special observations. He computed the San Nicolas triangulation of 1858, and prepared illustrative diagrams relating to magnetic discussions. R. Freeman has supplied the extra copying required for the use of field or office parties. Mr. Ledyard was engaged in the division during part of the month of July. Since January 1, 118 reports have been submitted on various subjects connected with the division. Notice of my labors in relation to solar spot observn,tions, terrestrial magnetism, and the solar eclipse of July, will appear in another part of the Superintendent's report.

During my absence from tho office in part of the months of April and June, and from June 9 to September 15, :Mr. AYery had charge of this division. Mr. Jolin IJownelS was employed in reading off the hourly heights of the tides from the self. registeriIJg observations of the coast of Florida. He has also plotted the meteorological observations taken at all tl1e stations on the Atlantic coast for transmission to the meteorological department of the Brititsh B()ard of Trade. Jllr. J. W'..

Report cj' Lieut. Thomas Wilson, U. S. A., Assistant in charge of the Drawing Diviswn.
CO.AST SURVEY OFFICE, October 1, 1860. I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the Drawing Division since November 1, 185!): The division has remained under my charge since the d:tte of my last report; for a full state· ment of the work accomplished during the year I respectfully refer to the lists presented below, where arc mentioned in detail the duties performed by each draughtsman, and the maps and sketches completed or in progress. The division has experienced a severe loss during the yearin the demise of Assistant W. M. C. Fairfax, draughtsman, who died on the 8th of .August. He ranked at tho head of his pro· fession, and for seventeen years (since 1843) bad devoted himself to his duties with unremitting fidelity and remarkable success; his exquisite reductions on the soho and 4 oJooo scales are monuments of his extraordinary skill, and they can never be excelled; this loss will always be felt, and his place will be difficult to fill. The number of draughtsmen proper is three less than at the close of la.st year; two tracers for photv9raph'!fhave been added to the force. Until the beginning of the year the subject of projects had been an exclusive branch in the division, and the entire time and attention of a first class draughtsman had been given to it. I have since given my best personal attention to

the study. Forty-one projects on the full scale for charts of various scales, from 4 0 01000 to ~' and of sketches, have been drawn, submitted, and approved during the year. In the previous year nineteen projects on the foll scale had been submittc<l and approved. The success of reduction by photography for the so~·oo scale and analogou:; charts is uo longer a matter of question; the re;;ults speak for themselYes, and in the future this method alone will be followed, except in cases to be mentioned presently. The mode of proceeding is as follows: The triangulation points of the sheet to be reduced are first examined to determine if they agree with the standard geographical position of the same points furuisheu by the Computing Division; first, as regards their own relative position, and then in reference to the projection. found on tlie sheet; if any irregularity is found, it is corrected by the most approved means. The features, both natural and artificial, of the sheet, are then generalized according to rules adopted for the use of the Coast Survey office, a careful study of the sheet being made with regard to the peculiarities of the locality, and the demand specially made of features to be preserved for topographical re0ord, and for use in navigation, features which, in some localities, are insignificant, being of primary importance in others. A projection of the limits of the sheet is made on tracing vellmn, and the generalized features traced thereupon, lines, &c., being made of such size and thickness as will conform (when reduced to the lf-Oioo scale) to the rules given for the published maps on that scale. The tracing is made step by step, adjustments being made for shrinkage or other irregularity. A photograph of the tracing is then made on glass, aud sent to the Drawing Division for verification; this is returned for use in the Engravillg Division, the outline being t.raced from it, and entered in the copper. A photograph on paper of the same scale is taken to be colored, according to the established rulP.s for representing topography, (where masses are of such a size m; to warrant it,) and to be :finished by a competent draughtsman, with the incidental features that are too small to be represented in such a manner. Where the character of the locality is one of complex contour the photographic print i .. made on the 40J0 0 scale, bachured in the Drawing Di vision, and then reduced Ly photogr,1phy to the~ scale for tho use of tho engmver. The prints of the different sheets are put down in their proper places on the p-'ojected limits of the map to be published, and having been colored and finished by pep·work in detail are ready for the engraver. I take great pleasure in here commending the very valuable services of Mr. E. Hergesheimer, draughtsman, whose time has been almost exclusively devoted co this branch of the service; his thorough knowledge of the subject, and his energy ann zeal are perceptible in the progress which has been made. Hand reduction is still employed for charts far advanced in engraving. Even in such cases, however, a great saving of time and labor hn.s been gained in the use of colors, the prominent idea being to replace by them well-de:finf'd masses of woods, sand, marsh, &c., &c., int1tead of indicating them by the old style of elaborate pen delineation. Th~, great assistance given by photography renders unnecessary the employment of other draugntsmen to fill the placefl of those who have left during the year. Assistant W. M. O. Fair.fax was employed upon the reduction of topography of coast maps and charts; No. 8, from Seguin Is1and light to Kennebunkport, Me., scale 80 -b-o-oi No. 9, from Cape Neddick, Me., to Cape Ann, Mass., n!ooi Nos. 35 and 36, Chesapeake bay, from Pocomoke sound to entrance, Md. and Va., so-iooi No. 37, from Cape Henry, Va., to Currituck sound, N.

RPport of Lieut. J. R. Smead, ll. S. A., in cllarye

ef

the Engraving Division.
ENGRA.VINO DIVISION,

U. S. Coast Survey Qffece, October 1, 1860.
I have the honor to present the annual report of the operations of this division, which has lJeen under my charge since the date of the last report. :Mr. Edward Wharton has been continued as assistant in the division, and I take pleasure ·, in acknowledging that I am indebted to him for lns courtesy, industry, and experience. His worth and efficiency are so well known in the office that I need not remark further in this connection. l\Ir. C. C. Callan replaced :\fr. William l\I, :Maynadier as clerk July 1, the latter having been transferred to the Miscellaneous Division. !fr. Callan gives me much ii)atisfaction in the performance of his duties. The force at present consists of twenty-four engravers of various degrees of skill, from the beginner to tb~ finished workman. A list is given below, with the class of each (as topographical, letter, or miscellaneous engraver) mentioned, and the work accomplished by each during the year. Thiti force, small as it was, when the amount of work accumulating from both hand and photographic reduction is considered, has been still further reduced by the death of Mr. J. V. N. Throop on the third of last July. }fr. Throop was an old and skilful letter engraver, and had served six years in this division. I trust the vacancy may soon he filled. The same need of first class experienced workmen exists now as formerly, and to a greater extent; for, as the "·hole work expands, the demand upon the Engraving Division increases, and that for work of greater excellence, as the preliminary and sketch work of former years, is now being replaced by finished maps and charts, "·hich latter, in addition to accuracy, are expected to exhibit the highest style of the art. The amount of useful information placed upon onr c:harts and sketches, in the form of notes, sailing direction8, description of clangen;, light-house, tidal, and other tables, has increased from year to year, and E<till continues to increase, making it very difficult to provide for this branch of the engraving with the present force of letter engravers. An increase of one first class letter engraver, and the permission to give out on contract some first class topography, would enable this division to complete in the next year au amount of ·work greater in proportion to the expenditures than in any preceding year, and for the simple reason that, the engraving force would be Letter balanced as to its different classes, and work could be laid out to greater advantage. 'l'he means to carry out the suggestion contained in the above statement are available, and can be secured immediately upon the receipt of the proper authority.

f/

the Electrotype Di.vision.

UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY OFFICE, September 17, 1860. I respectfully present tlie following report of the operations in this division since the date of my last annual report, September 17, 1859. By the electrotype process we have made fifty-one plates; of tbis number, nineteen were in alto and thirty-two in basso. We have also made fonr plates for other departments of the government. One plate has been extended in size by the electrotype process. In my last annual report I announced that the reducing of the charts by photography was, at last, after years of experimenting, in successful operation in the office. The beginning thus announced has proved the commencement of a very important and valuable branch o:' the officework. During t11e year the photographic reduction of charts has been steadily in use, and before long will entirely supersede hand reducing. In December lust the first effort at tho regular employment. of photography in the office was made. Mr. W. H. Gardner was then detailed to assist me by making tracings from plane-table sheets, and Mr. E. Hergesheimer in preparing the projections and overseeing the work in all matters relating to geographical positions and correct delineations, where the experience of a skilful draughtsman is i·otp1ircd. In February this force was increased by the addition of Mr. F. W. ~facdel to assist i:1 tracing. Under the arrangement thus made seventy-nine plane-fable sheets were traced and photographed by the first day of July last, when the success of the photogn1phic method was deemed so certain that it was established as a regular office method, and the preparation of tracings, and all matters relating to positions, delineations, &c., became the duty of the Drawing Division, the photographing of the tracings being assigned to this division as part of its regular duty. Under this last arrangement the photograph has increased in utility and value. Some of the finest charts of the survey have been reduced by it, and are now being engraved. I append a table of the photographs made s:ioce December 12, from which it will be seen that there have been

206

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

reduced not less than fifty-five sheets, comprising the major part of eight coast charts. Coast chart No. 29, which I stated in my last annual report as having been successfully reduced and in the hands of the engraver, is in the course of completion. The reduction of coast chart No. 21, (New York bay and harbor,) which I also announced as being partly made, has been retraced, in order to make it conform to the rules for tracing which were estabfo;lied for giving uniformity to the charts. The San Pablo chart, which I reporteu last year as being reduced, ·was laid aside for the same reason. The methods employed in the photographic reductions are mainly the same as stated in my last report, excepting that, instead of furnishing the reduction to the engraver on paper, it is now given on glass, or what is termed a "collodion positive." By t!rn use of glass all the errors and difficulties arising from hygrornetric action are avoided. Instead of a isheet of gelatine paper to transfer the design from the reduction to the copper, a plate of mica can be used over quite a large portion of the design on the glass, with the certainty of conformity- with the projection on the copper; the time saved by a voiding the delays from hygrometric changes, and in making small transfers, being of great importance in the cost and time of getting out the chart. In this way the work of coast chart No. 9 (Kennebunkport to Cape Ann, Mass.,) has been very rapidly executed. Instead of furni:,;hing the engraver, as formerly, with a finished design of the chart, together with the original or plane-table sheets to assist hirn in entering it in the copper, he is nm\ furnished with the outlines only, and of but a portion of the chart at a time. This outline is the photograph, (Lim colludion positive,) on glass, of the tracing, and has the latitude and longitude lines numbered to conform with the projections on the copper plate. As there is nothing on the glass phtte but what is to be transferred to the copper, the work is thus unerringly entered in the copper. 'While the engraver is cutting in the outlines, a paper print from. the negative of the tracing is placed in the hands of the draughtsman, who indicates the filling of the outlines merely by colors, irnstead of endeavoring, as formerly, to present the finished appearance of the chart by elaborately dnrnring the topographical signs for wood, marsh, &c. Using these for such parts only as are too small to exhibit the colors plainly, the engraver enters the filling from samples of wood, marsh, &c. In this way uniformity is produced in the appearance of the charts, and errors prevented. Advantage of this mechanical method is t.aken further to assist the engraver by supplying him with an enlarged photographic print of the outline, in which the minute forms he has to engrave, and the smaller patches of color, will be seen at a glance. This enlarged print is generally on a scale double that of the chart scale. The adYantages incidental to the photographic method have gained for it high favor with the engravers. Of the relative cost of tho photographic and hand methods of reducing an exact estimate cannot yet be made; but from the work of the past year I think the photographic method will turn out to cost about one-sixth of the hand-work. Of the comparative value of the two methods, I can say that there is no doubt of the very great superiority of tho photographic method; for it turns out that so great are the incidental advantages in the process of engraving tbat the savings from these alone will thrice repay the cost of the photographic reduction. With regard to the accuracy of the photographic reductions, nothing remains to be desired; experience having showu that they are superior to the hand reductions in this respect. Fears were at first entertained that, in engraving the chart from detached portions of the reductions non-conformity of adjacent parts would arise; but the experience of the year has shown that the junctions of the adjacent sheets can be made as well on the tracing as on the reduced drawing, and consequently no overlapping or ill-fitting of the photographs has appeared. During the year the development of photography has been closely watched, with a view to t~ie further application of the art to the purposes of the survey. The processes of photo· lithography and carbon printing have received especial attentionj but little ro::perime-nting, how-

THE l:NITED STATES COAST S1:"'RVEY.

ever, has been done in these, the large amount of photographic work executed having precluded this, and left but little time for investigation except in the direct line of the work. Several practical applications of photo-lithography have lately been macle, both in thiR country and in Europe; yet all the specimens exhibited have indicated that the art is still too crude to be employed for the pur1Joses of the survey. The great vrospect of celerity of execution which this new art holds ont still makes it attractive, and it should by no means be neglected by the survey. Though I think the photo-lithograph too imperfect at present to he used for the 1rn1)1ication of our charts, I stilt hold the opinion expressed in my last report, that tho ordi11ary photographic process may be advantageously used for the publication of some of our smaller eharts and ~ketches. I had hoped that a trial of this would have been made in the past year, and still hope that the office will order the experiments to be made. During the year I have been assisted hy Mr. D. Hi11kle. Again it becomes my duty to commend him for his application to the work. Excepting the arra11gcments for making the tracings noticed above, there has been no additional force in this division; and the large amount of photographing executed, in addition to our former regular duties, is in a great measure the result of his industry. The following summary shows the number of plane-table sheets rnduced by photography for the charts to. which the material on them applies: Coast chart No. 9. · · · · · . · · · · · · · · · · - · · ·. · · · · ·. · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·

Alexander from October 1 until April 23, when he resigned his position, and was succeeded by Mr. C. C. Callan, who was transferred to the Engraving Division July l; since that date :Mr. ,V. M. Maynadier has assisted Mr. King. In addition to these duties, Mr. King assists in the clerical duties in the office of the assistant in charge. In the :Miscellaneous Division Lis services are invaluable, from his intimate acquaintance with the details of the duty and his steady application to its performance. Mr. W. Mertz backs and stretches the printing paper, and backs and repairs plane-table and other sheets for use in the Drawing Division of the office. He has given entire satisfaction during the year. In tlie printing office, Mr. Rutherdale, as printer, with his assistant, Mr. _:Barrett, have been industrious, and very constant in their attendance. I have caused to be prepared, and herewith respectfully submit, a statement of Coast Survey maps, charts, and sketches distributed during the year; also a statement of the distribution of Coast ·survey reports, and of the maps, charts, sketches, and miscellaneous matter printed, since the date of the last annual report.

GENERALIZATION OF CONTOUR AND OTHER NATURAL FEATURES FOR REDUCTION TO 80 ~ 00 ·

Conlour.-The feature of contour is in itself so varied a subject that it is impracticable to give definite rules which will cover all cases. The draughtsman or reducer must have some latitude, and exercise judgment and discretion in the modification and generalization he applies to the matter before him. Some rules can be observed, however, which will lead to system iu the process of reduction and uniformity iir tbe results. In reducing contour the peculiar formation of the country should be carefully studied, and the general character of the mountains, hills, or undulations, made the hasi:< of generalization. Main ranges and general forms of hills should be preserved, >d1ile smaller det:iils of brnken and irregular contour, which are overcome by the general feature>i of ihe hill or range, may le modified or omitted, according to their conspicuousness and extent, and the incapacity of the scale to express them clearly. In cases of particularly broken and irregular coutour, such as Cape Ann, Cape Cod, and parts of the coast of Maine, the reduction and generalization must be made more in reference to the size and natural conspicuousness of individual features, at the same time studying the general formation and rising of the laud from the shore. Certain general forms and features can sometimes be traced even in the most broken and apparently irregular country; and as these would be all that could be clearly distinguished in a distant view of the coast, they should have a corresponding conspicuousness and cxprcE<sion on our coast charts, which, on the smaller scales, are intended to represent, as it were, such a diminished or distant view. Where a low, undulating· country is to be reduced, with slopes varying from one to ten degrees, and elevations from twenty to three hundred feet, the very nature of tlie contour will admit of the full representation of snch slopes and forms, :rno, thnrefore, the generalization should be made with the full number of 20 feet curveR. The rule beiug to generalize minor features and irregularities of not over one hundred metres in extent, or of from five to fifteen feet in height. Where slopes from five to twenty degrees predominate with heiglits from 50 to 500 feet, the generalization may be made with 40 feet curves, modi(ying minor details of from 100 to 150 metres in extent, with heights from 10 to 80 feet. In section8 of still bolder and larger features of contour, as on onr wesiern coast, where slopes from ten to forty-five degrees occur, with elevafions of 1, 000 and 2, 000 feet, the general· ization may be made with 100 feet curves, and minor details of from 100 to 200 metres in extent, and from 20 to 50 feet in Leight may be modified or omitted. In all cases wher~ 40 and 100 feet cun·es are used in reducing and generalizing contour, when features of characteristic importance occur above, beticcen, or bdow these curves, such as summits, spurs, and ridges, and the sloping bases of hills, &c., auxiliary curves shall be used as a guide to the engraver a11d in hachuring. As different feat.ores of contour on the same map, or in the same locality, may require the use af all these curves of generalization, a distinct sign shall be used for each curve, viz: For 20 feet curves, a full line. For 40 feet curves, a dashed line.* For 10() feet curves, a dashed and dotted line. For auxiliary curves, a dotted line. Important summits should be noted by figures. A few experiments with different subjects carefully treated would be the best practical illustration of these rules, and the best guide in their future application.

REPORT 01'' THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Salt mar8h.-N ext to contour, salt marsh is perhaps the most important characteristic and unalterable natural feature of our coast topography. In reducing large tracts of salt marsh, the general character and condition of the marsh and of the surrounding country should be com;idered. If it i;; a broken, i,ioft marsl1, full of fibrous creekB, like that in San Francisco bay, its generalization would require different treatment in reduction from IJ1e firm and uniform marslies of Delaware bay. In one there.is a vast number of small creeks breaking up the entire mass of the .marsh with comparatively few leading to landings, or fast land. In the other case each creek almost leads to some pond or other source,·, or is the outlet of some frel?h water stream from the back country. The . Bame size and character of creek, therefore, has a <liffereu t significance, according to the kind of marsh through which it runs, and the importance it may have as a peculiar feature. In generalizing details in salt marsh the following rules may be observed, viz: All main creeks which aro 10 metres wide, or more, and ~which can be distinctly shown by double lines, shall be represented as given on the field-maps. Small fibrous creeks branching from tl1ese main creeks, and not leading to any important locality in or through the marsh, may be omitted. Small pond8 and water holes, if not over 100 or 150 metres in extent, may be omitted. Small hammockB of fast land, near the general outline of fast land at the' head of coves, &c., and such as are not conspicuous landmarks, or important for landings, &c., may be omitted when of less size than 100 or 150 metres. Minor irregularities of 100 or 150 metres ]n the outline of fast land surrounding tracks of salt marsh may be generalized to uniform sweeps and lines. Small detached patches of salt marsh of 100 or 158 metres in extent, within the general limits of fast land, may be omitted. The limits of fast land or sand beach, bordering salt marshes, should be shaded by grassing or dotting, to indicate the general rising of such land from the level of the marsh; this will define the outline distinctly, and give a good contra::;t and effect to the different features. Sand beaches and sand hills.-Tho outside line of sand beaches forms a large proportion of the main sea-coast, and will come under the rule for reducing and generalizing shore-line given under that head. · The inside line of beaches bordering on ponds, marsh, or fast land, is generally more irregular than the outside line, and may be modifit·d and generalized in the same way as the outline of marsh and fast land by blending small irregularities of 100 or 150 metres into general sweeps and lines. Sand hills on many ocean beaches are a conspicuous feature, and often important landmarks. The general formation and condition of these hills should be carefully studied, and the reduction made to express the general characteristic effect. .A.s a general rule, the outside range of sand hills and bluffl'l E<hould be reduced as closely as the f'cale will admit, particularly on southern beaches where there is no high land :·hawing bebind tbem. Irregular masses of sand kno1ls, &c., back of the general sea-line of hill8 or bluffs, can be generalized and blended as their con· dition and form may require. Individual knolls of 100 or 150 metres in extent, and not more than 10 feet high, may be omitted at discretian. On heaches where few sand hills occur, those that do exist should be represented even if quite small. Single trees and clumps of trees growing on ocean beaches should be represented in the reductions, particularly where the beach is far from the main land, or where the country is i;iot generally wooded. Where a larger ex.tent of woods occms the general outline should be well defined. If it is open and irregular in its growth, small patches of trees and open spaces of 100 or 150 metres in extent may be generalized and blended in the general.mass of wood. Woods.-The natural growth of woods forms a distinguishing and conspicuous feature in many sections of our ma-coast, and their importance as a topographical feature may be classed with their conspicuousness. In the northern section£>, where they have been pa.rti!l-lly ~leared off, and where they are scattered unequally over different kinds of contour, they beoom.A

a. secondary feature. In some of the southern sections where they form the general background of the coast they form a first class feature; and, again, as on parts of the coast of Texas, their entire absence becomes a peculiar eharacteri;;tic of the coast. In the first case, sm:;tll patches of woods of 100 or 150 metres in extent, and eve11 larger patches of irregular and open growth, are often obscured by more conspicuous contour, aml may be omitted at discretion. Irregularities in the outline of large masses of woods, both iu 11illy country and in the middle and southern sections, may be genernlized in the manner of other outlines and to the same extent, 100 or 150 metres. Small detached patches and open spaces of 100 or 150 metres i11 extent, where they occur among larger rnas.,es, may be omitted or filled up, respectively, at discretion. In sections of the coast where few trees exist, and on islands anu beaches remote from the main shore, omissions should not be made, but small clumps and even single trees should. generally be represented. Fresh manJh.-On our sea-coast fresh marsh is not a general or extensiv<:. feature, and not naturally conspicuous. Small detached pieces of fresh marsh, from 100 to 150 metres in extent, when they occur among broken and wooded hills, may generally be omitted as an inexpressive feature. Where they indicate hollow,.; or stream beds they s!Jould be expressed, within the capacity of the scale, say to 100 metres in extent. The mtlrgins of ponds and the sources of streams, where they occur in open and cultivated land, should be indicated within t.he capacity of tbe scale, to show distinctly, say, from 50 to 100 met.res. Slwre-line.-The limit of land and water is the most striking and important outline which exists in nature, and it should be the strongest and most conspicuous line of boundary between natural features represented upon a map. To give proper effect to this feature in publications, the actual shore-line should be made strong and conspicuous, aud represented Ly a full black line of not less than three metres thick, and may, in sourn characters of shore, be made five metres thick. Besides this, which we may term heavy line, the immediately adjoining topography should be distinctly and strongly represented by its proper sign; and if it be 0f sand, marsh, level upland, rising hill-sides, or rocks, the representation should be slightJy.strongcr 1han that used for the same sign further back from the shore. This ·will give a more striking contrast to the limits of the land and water, and will show the detail outline of bays, coves, points, islands, &c., in strong relief, which is important. While the strength of the shore-line and tone of the adjoining topography are increased, tl{e lo\Y water sanding, and one, two, and three fathom curve 1munding, where given, should be made as light and open as the sign will bear. This will still further increase the contrast between the land and water, and be a marked improvement in the general and detailed effect of the maps of the Coast SurYey, which unite the properties of both maps and charts, and particularly req11ire distinctness and naturalness in each of these characteristics. The example prepared as a sign for ''wet sanding'' will show the degree of tone and effect to be produced in representing this feature. In reducing and generalizing the detailed irregularities of shore-line, a careful study should he made of the general character and formation of the adjoining topography, and not only the mere water line be generalized, but the character and formation of the coast blended in the general representation. Ia the shore-line of a broken and rocky coast, like parts of Maine, Cape Ann, &c., irregu· larities of rocks and ledges1 which (\re evidently of the same character as the general coast line, may be generalized to a greater degree than irregularities of the same dimensions, but of different nature. Thus the small, smooth coves, which sometimes occur along the shores of a rocky C(){\JJt, have a different topograpliical character from the general formation, and should he noticed with particularity. In the same sense a point or ledge of rocks, breakiIJg out from a generally smooth shore-line, should be more miuutely represented than the same point need he if occurring with a mass or continuation of similar rocky points and ledges along a naturally

220

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

rough and broken coast. As a general rule, therefore, the irregularities of shore-line on a. coast of uniform clwracter may be modified and generalized to a somewhat greater degree than where the character is varied, and detailed irregularities of from 30 to 50 metres in extent be blended in the general representation. 'l'bis "·ill apply particularly to the rocky shore-line of New England, to hard marsh shores, such as occur in bays and sounds, and to coral banks, like the shores of the Florida keys. The shore-line of sand beaches and of bays and rivers of earth formation are generally more sweeping and uniform and can be reduced with slight modifications; where irregularities dq exist, they are more apt to be in the banks, bluffs, and ravines immediately bordering the shore than in the actual water-line, and should be treated more as features of contour than of shore-line, and generalized as their character and importance may require. Where small banks and bluffs, with gnllies and ravines, do occur,_ they ~re generally in a shore either level or sliglitly nmlulating, and are features not generally involved with other details, likely to obscure or confuse tl1em; and as they are clm;ely connected with the actual shore-line, the generalization should not be as great as IJ?<LY be made with the same class of features further inland. A limit of 50 metres in extent should include all the ordinary details to be omitted or generalized. The shore-line of islands comes under the same rule as applied to main shore-line. In caBes of small islands, single rocks, &c., which occur in localities of hydrographic importance, they should Le strongly and distinctly represented, and if quite small they should be exaggerated to the size of 25 metres, and no siugle rock near a channel way, or so distant from shore as to be dangerous to navigation, should Le represented less than this size. Where a number of rocks are clustered together, making the mass conspicuous, the individual rocks may he indi· cated by a smaller sign if necessary. Low water.-Low water, both to the field topographer and hydrographer, and in the office operations of drawing and reducing, is the most uncertain and difficult to determine and express of any natural feature of the survey. The question of the determination of thi;.; feature in the field at once presents a practical and physical difficulty of seriou~ importance. The means and methods of the topographic and hydrographic work have conditions both in favor and against assigning tbe determination of it exclmlively to either of these departments of the survey. There are circumstances and cases where the topographical survey could not embrace all features of low water unless at great dis1\dvantage and expense, and even then imperfectly and inconsistenly with hydrographic results. On the other hand, the hydrography could not develop a11 the irregularities of low water by t,he ordinary process of field-work. In bays, coves, rivers, &c., where the character of the shore is irregular, the condition of the shore at low water gm1erally corresponds to that of high water, and the points, islands, banks, &c., of such shores, afford facilities for the topography to determine the low-water line with rapidity and accuracy, with all minor details commanded and determined. The same degree of detail, however, could not he obtained by the usual hydrographic process of work. Shoals off-shore, in the middle of large sounds and bays and ex.tensive flats, either connected or unconnected with the main shore, can be determined more favorably and economio!llly by the hydrography. They come within the full scope of that work. and 01tn generally be ~om manded by sounding lines and angles in a satisfactory manner. The position being remote from shore, often of soft and undefined suhi;tance, impracticable for occupied stations, makes the determination by the topographical parties difficult and objectionable. A question of accuracy is involved in this matter ooyond .the mere process of the survey. The hydrographic results are based on a condition of tide not naturally visible, being "mean low water;" where the limits of shoals and middle grounds and ex.tensive tlat.s are redaeed to the same plane, the results coincide with the soundings and the development of :the bottom,

which is important in relation to navigation. In the irregularities or extent of low water nearer the land this condition is not so essential, as the shore iR more cautiously approached by vessels, and therefore less dangerous in navigation. In consideration of these factH, the actual survey of low water may be advantageously assigned, in division, to both the topographical and hydrographic parties, un<lcr the following general rules: 1. All low-water limits, extending from the shores of bays, sounds, rivers, &c .. and around islands, shall be determined, in all tho necessary detail, by the topographical parties, to a distance averaging one-quarter of a mile (400 metres) from shore, tho survey to be made as nearly at medium tides as practicable and consistent with the general progres,; of the work. 2. In cases of off-shore shoals, middle grounds, flats, &c., and all low-water lines extending beyond the prescribed limits of the topographical survey, the determinations shall be made by the hydrographic parties, and com1idered as their especial duty. 3. Where cases of peculiar character and condition occur, making it advisable to modify this rule, full official authority shall be had to deviate from it, with a distinct agreement and understanding between the field, topographical, and hydrographic parties in regard to the case in question. 4. In addition to this assignment of the field-work, each p11rty shall include as much of the low-water determination, beyond the limits prescribed as its particular duty, as can be commanded and determined in the regular operations of each party, not interfering with proper progress. Thiii will serve as a test to both operations, and aid in adjusting differences which may occur. Thi;,i reference to field-work is made as a preface and guide to the office adjustment of work already done, and as a basis for the rule;; and reasons for adopting or relying upon one standard of party results rather than another. The same argument holds good in favor of inclining to the hydrographic results for off-shore low water, and the topographical results for low water near the main land, in the office as in the field. Frequent instances of disagreement in results occur under circ1.mstances of doubt as to whether the differences are errors of survey or the result of changes which have occurred between the dates of the separate surveys. As a general rule, in adjustinp: such cases, the natural formation and character of the coast shall be considered; and if it is one liable to change, and the error is not so great as to require ·revision of field-work, and the different surveys are equally reliable, the result;; of the last sm·vey made shall be taken. If this does not cover the case, and there arc no data by which to determine changes or errors in either survey, the·results con,forming most naturally to the Blwrounding topographiccil and hydrograpldc details shall be adopted. If doubt still exi.i::its, the subject shall be referred to the Superintendent to order a resurvey. Returning to thB consideration of the office reductiolls and gnnernlization of low water, I would remark: l. The sign for low water shall be that uniformly used for sand, Yiz: dotted work, and in t11e style called "irregul.o..r sanding." The arguments in favor of this sign and of discarding the sign of mud are, :first, the greater proportion of sand in 101v water formation to any other material; second, the uncertainty as to whether the r;hoal is mud or sctnrl, bein;; in most cases remote from shore,.and only observed upon from distant stations; third, the uniformity and consistency of this sign with that used for the one, two, and three fathom shoals, which is sand, even where written indication is given of different character of bottom, as l:lticky, soft, &c.; fonrt.h, the advantage of a uniform and given sign for a uniform feature. 2. The style and tone of this sanding shall be a, medium between the high water and ''wet sanding/' ma.king it conform more to the tone of the latter, in order, as stated under an other head, to give contrast and relief to the shore-line, or limit between land and water. The out-

222

REPORT OF THE SUPEHINTENDENT OF

side limit,.; of shoal8 left dry at low water, being the low water line, shall be a dotted line, but slightly closer and more distinct than the line of the one, two, am1 three-fathom shoals. The main level of low water flats and shoals shall be as open as the sign and scale wiU bear. 3. 'Vhere features of peculiar character occur in the body of low water shoals and flats, or where Emch shoals are composed entirely of materials other than sand or mud, the following signs shall be used, viz: Ledges of solid or broken rock: imitation of rock, showing strata, &c. Loose stones, boulders, &c. : imitation of large and small stones, &c. Oyster beds and shell banks: imitation of shells. Coral reef: imitation of coral. 4. ln generalizing the outline of low water freedom may be taken with small irregularities as in other outlines, and modifications made where occasion demands to a greater degree than with high water-(etails of 100 metres in extent being blended and omitted in expressing general lines and curves at discretion. "Where figures of soundings occur along the outline of low water, showing the depth of small coves or holes, the feature shall be exaggerated, if necessary, so as always to show the sounding figures dearly and distinctly within the space indicated. In generalizing the outliue of rocks, ledges of i;tones, coral reefs, &c., small irregularities may be modified as above; au<l small detached features of 50 and 75 metres in extent be omitted where they come within the general limits of the shoal.
II.
liYDROGRAPHIC REDUCTIONS

In treatillg the subject of hydrographic reductions the following views are presented for consideration: In adopting a system of rules and signs the question of minuteness and complexity should be borne in mind; the reductions and generalizations made to conform to the capacity of the scale, and the signs adopted, both for natural features and individual objects, should be simple, distinct, and characteristic, and s~fficiently descriptive to give proper information, and guard against confusion and mistakes. "While the main question under consideration is to free the charts from an excess of detail, it may still be nece:;:i;Hy to add certain details where important features require them; and the advantage of sbowi.ng the channel ef deepest water by some proper and conspicuous sign is one of much interest . .A uniform system of lettering, in the size and character of letters used, will tend to a more ready understanding of the maps. The size and style of figures for soundings is a question of mechanical practicability which is already undergoing some tests in the engraving process. Experiments are being made with punches, which, if successful, will tend to uniform and satisfactory results. The abbreviations for the characters of bottom are already well established nnd sufficiently good. The above remarks are made on the present condition of the work as a preface to the general remarks which follow, and as pointing to the reasons and objects for change and improvement, for wbich I would respectfully recommend the following rules and signs: 1. The actual shore-line, as the most important and conspicuous limit of distinct natural features, ;hould be the strongest line used as a corresponding conventional sign. This has been cstablisl1cd under another head, and is to be a ful1 black line, from three to five metres thick, according to the kind of shore to be repn::sented. 2. Low water, as an extemive feature, and its outside limits, as the ''low-water line," are to be represented according to the rule and sign established by dotted work. The low·water line to be i·educed and generalized in its details, conforming to soundings and hydrographic results, as circumstances may require; under the rules given.

THE UNITED STATES CO.AST SURYEY.

223

3. The sign and style for representing the one, two, and three-fathom shoals shall be uniformly of dotted work,in the manner termed "irregular sandfrtg." The limit of each shoal being the one, two, and three-fathom "curye" shall be a dotted line, from which a narrow border of shading by closer dotted "\York shall be made, blending with the more open tone of main surface of the shoal, which shall be of a uniform and even tint. These dotted lines, and the tone of the different shoals, shall be made gradually more light and open as they increase in depth. In reducing and generalizing these features from the original hydrographic sheets small irregularities may be modified as in other features of the 'vork, blending small points and coves into such general sweeps and lines as can be clearly expregsed on the reduced scale. A general rule sha11 govern the reduction of these details where they are connected with figurel'I of sounding, which is to make all points and spots and all coves and holes sufficiently large to show the outline of such details separate and distinct from the sounding figures. The style, tone, degree of closenees, or openness ot' the sign for this sanding, shall be in exact accordance with the sample given. 4. In preliminary sketches, or in charts where the fathom shoals are not sanded, the fathom ''curves'' shall be indicated by dotted lines with the si.gn for the denomination of each curve given as now used, viz: Single dots for one-fathom curves. Double dots for two-fathom curves. Triple dots for three-fathom curves. The number of dots and the distance between each group shall be so separated and distinct as to make the sign for each curve plainly distinguishable. Where small features and irregularities in these curves occur the dotting may be brought closer together at the particular point. in question if it is necessary to do so in order to show the detail curve of the line, &c. The same rule with regard to surrounding the soundings; figures shall be applied, as in dotted work, so as to avoid all confusion and indistinctness of details and figures. These curves may be reduced according to the ru1e estahlished for the sanded shoals, generalizing minor irregularities of 100 metres in extent at discretion. 5. Rocks "awash" shall be shown by the usual sign of a black star; the length of the crossing lines where a single rock is indicated shall be fifty metres; where a .:'.luster of rocks occur, they &:r be shown less than this size if de8irable, but not less than thirty metres. 6. Sunken rocks shall be shown by the usual sign of a black cross; the length of the crossing lines shall be fifty metres for single rocks, and from this size to thirty metres for clusters of rocks at discretion. 7. The size and style of sounding figures shall be according to the samples given, and aH the figures, with their fractions of the same denomination, 8hall be of equal aud uniform height. Fractions of fathoms of one-fourth, one-half, and three-fourths may be used where required, but all fractions of feet shall be omitted. Three sizes of figures only !'ball be used, the largest for off-shore and deep soundings; the second or medium size, fon;ounds, bays, uncl waters where the details do not require very close work; the smallest size in narrow channels and circum· scribed localities, where the figures require to be numerous-and close, and not to be generaHy used unless the work requires it. The following signs shall be used for the artificial details connected with bydrographic
matter~

Revolving light: white spot, fifty metres, rayA fifty metres. Fixed light: black spot, fifty metres, rays fifty metres. Lighted beacon: spot :fifty metres, rays fifty metres. Light-ship: ship 100 metres, rays 100 metres. Bell-boat: boat 100 metres, mast 100 metres.

Dark beacon: sides of triangle fifty metres. Spindle: spot fifty metres, stake seventy-five metres. Can lmoy: diameter seventy-five metres. Nun buoy: diameter seventy.five metres. Spar buoy: length 100 metres. The question of uote8, tables, reference!'!, &c., in text, which accompany our charts, is one depending so much on Jocal peculiarities and conditions tliat no precise rule can be given in regard to it. In arranging and preparing these matters as items of information, I shouHl recommend having as much put upon the face of the chart as practicable, such as signs, sailing courses, ranges, &c., represented and drawn rather than described. Jn developing and indicating the navigability of bays, harbors, rivers, &c., uniformly and consistently with the depth of water which can be carried into such waters over outer bars and through outer channels, I would recommend the following general rules, which in some cases will free the map from considerable detail, and at the same time add to its clearness and effect: 1. In maps of bays, harbors, &c., where the depth of water at the entrance is more than one fathom and less than two fathoms, the "sanding" of the shoals on such a map shall be made to one fathom only. 2. Where the entrance has a depth of two fathoms and less than three, the sanding shall be made for one and two-fathom shoals only. 3. Where the entrance has a depth of three /atlwms and over, the sanding shall include the one, two, and three-fathom shoals. 4. Beyond this depth, and for all entrances between three and five fathoms, the channel of deepest water shall be indicated by a full line, with the exact depth of such channel in feet written along this line near the bar or entrance of the bay or harbor in question. 5. Where a bar or spit makes off or produces breakers, &c., near the entrance of harbors of shoal entrance, they may be indicated by dotted lines if of greater depth than the main channel. 'I'hus, a one-fathom harbor with the one-fathom shoals sanded may have a two or three-fathom outside bar indicated by dotted lines, (as by rule.) We buve thus at a glance the capacity of each harbor indicated, and while the deeper harboni and channels arc defined and classified, as ·San Francisco, Portland, Newport, New York, Norfolk, &c., the harbors of lesser capacity are not closed, and the details of bottom, currents, buoys, figures, &c., felt much more clearly and distinctly than when expressed9over sanded and darkened ground.

REDUCTIONS BY PHOTOGRAPHY.

The reduction by photography of the original field-sheets of the Coast Survey to the smaller publication scales has proved, so far, successful, and is so much more rapid and accurate in its results than the best methods of hand reduction heretofore used that it will be considered as the basis of the rules and process of reduction to be adopted, and which I herewith present for your approval. Some general directions may be given establishing system and uniformity in the office opera· tions which will tend to facilitate the preparation of work, and insure accuracy in final results. In takiug up the project of a coast chart, after being thoroughly considered and adopted, the following rules i;hould be observed: . 1. The examination of field-work and the topographical and hydrographic material for the map. Investigation as to when the surveys were made; who by; iithey have been verified in the field; the da.te of this verification; if the section of coast invvlved is lianle to change, &c., with the question of examination or resurvey of changes, if already made or necessary to be made. 2 · Inquiries instituted to collect all collateral information, such as names, &c., which may be

wanting; application to Light-house Board for light-housei;i, buoys, &c., and all matters referring to them. Application to War Department for signs for forts, &c., and other matter referable to it. 3. Consideration of title for maps, names of field aseistants, &c.; uotes, tables. &c. A manuscript sbould be carefully made of title, note8, tables, &c., to be a .fac Bi mile of that to be engraved, and adjustments, alterations, &c., made upon it, perfecting all its arrangement before the engraving of title and notes is commenc.:d. 4. After examining the material to be employed, the projections, points, joining of sheets, &c., should be tested, and all errors of shrinkage and disagreements not referable to field-work should be reconciled and corrected. 5. Before tracing and generalizing the field-sheets thus prepared, the outlines of detail should be examined by an experienced draughtsman, and all cases of faded or indistinct work carefully gone over, and all lines and objects to be traced made so distinct that there will be no liability of error or omission in discerning them through the vellum or tracing paper used. 6. An accurate projection, corresponding to the projection of the field-sheet to be traced, should then be made on vellum, and the details of the field-sheet traced in outline, equalizing and generalizing errors of shrinkage, &c., minute by minute, on the new projection. Joinings of different sheets which may have irregular shrinkage or other minor disagreements should be adjusted and made to coincide on this vellum projection. 7. In tracing the details from the original field-sheets the generalization should be made, for which rules have been given for each particular feature. shore-line, roads, enlarging them if necessary to the width required as the sign, omitting private roads, &c. Shading of town and village blocks and streets, giving the proper sign for single houses, out-l10uses, &c.; omitting unimportant buildings, &c., fences; omitting lots less than 100 metres square; mart>h, with the accompanying detai!R of creeks, pondR, hammocks, &c., generalized according to the rules given. Woods, freRh marsh, &c., generalized according to the rules given; contour generalized according to the rule given, with the 20, 40, and 100 feet curves drawn according to the sign given for each, &c. · 8. The style of this tracing should be adapted to the purpose of photographing, for whicb it is especially intended, giving proper distinctness and effect to the reduced photograph. The traced lines should be made in pure black ink, and all outlines, as shore-line, roads, &c., should be stronger and heavier than contour Jines or lines of secondary features. 9. 'l'his tracing should be carefully examined and compared witl1 the original s11eets traced, and all omissions and errors corrected; the number of the sheet and the date of the tracing written in sufficiently large figures and letters on the tracing to be read distinctly when photographed. 10. Duplicate photographs should then be taken on ~; one for the purpose of hachuring where the details of contour require it as a guide tor engraving, and the other for reference to the contour lines in verifying the bachuring made. 11. Duplicate photographs should then be made of the same tracing on · v ~ 0 a· One on glass for the engraver for tracing outlines and contour; the other on paper, to be colored and worked up by the draughtsman as the guide and standard for signs and detailed representations. 12. The working up of the photographed reduction must depend on the character and detail of the natural features and the closeness of the work reduced. Rules have been given for all the natural and artificial signs, and a system of colors as substitutes for the details of signs for a~l feature>i in masses. There may be cases, however, of complex and varied details where the simple legend of color will not answer as a full guide to the engraver; in Emch cases the signs, hachuring, and other details to be exp.ressed must be worked up fully and completely by pen

work, in the st:de and according to the precise rules given for the features and detail~ in question. 13. Having completed the arrangements and operations above specified the work is ready for engrnving. Tliis i;,; a process <lepeuding for its excellence upon the practical and artistic skill of the engraver; and in this fact has existed the greatest difficulty and want of uniformity in the former publications of the survey. But it is expected that the rules, signs, and directions which have been provided for every feature and department of this work will insure uniform and certain results. While the maps are relieved from confusing and minute details, such features only are required to be represented as come within the full capacity of the scale, and with the sign given for each feature when followed in outline and in tone; in accordance with the sample and rule provided a series of maps should be produced in harmony with each other, and possessing tlie uniform characteristics of the country and of the survey. 14. All provisional matters involved in the publications should be prepa"red for as early as practicable. For instance, the position and character of forts, light-houses, &c., should be given to the engraver with the first of bis work outlines, in order that he may accommodate the detail of his work to the sign which is to be represented. 15. To facilitate the engraving operations and insure uniformity in details, punches and dies ·will be made for small signs where practicable, such as houses, light-houses, buoys, sounding figures, sunken rock!:', &c. Gravers for lines of certain and established sizes, both for outline 1vork and for hachuring, can also be made. Thus different operators of varied ability, skill, and taste can work independently of' each other, and yet tlieir work when brought together will not be strikingly dissimilar, except in point ot execution. 16. In no instance is a reducer, draughtsman, or engraver to depart from the rules aud si~ns prescribed for the representation of the work unless by special official authority, and with full underbtanding of the necessity and advantage of :mch deviation from rule.

IV.

SCALE OF SHADES.

I present herewith a report on the scale of shades adapted to the hachuring of hill contours as determined by the operations of the Coast Survey, and required for their representation on

the published maps. This subject has been ably and elaborately treated in former dit:H.:ussions by Lieut. A. A. Humphreys and Assistant W. M. C. Fairfax, and the merits and demerits, both in general and detail effect, of the different systems of shade and hachuring fully considered and argued. I will not, therefore, go over this ground again in presenting the results of the inveE>tigation of this subject, which you directed me to make. Practical difficulties and objections were found to exist in all of the former systems of shade used; some in the mechanical process of drawing and engraving, others in the effect produced. To develop tbe c<Jpabilities of the different. scales of shades a careful practical test has been made of tliose deemed most worthy of trial by applying them in hachuring a subject of natural coutour which had been closely surveyed-involving varied and extreme slopes-the result has been quite satisfactory, and has led to the construction of a scale of shades combining the merits of the different scales tested, with some modifications and additions, which is herewith presented for your approval. It is proper to state here the reasons why neither of the already existing scales were adopted, and also to give the basis and reasons in favor of the scale proposed. 1. IJehman's scale, as reported by Lieut. (now Capt.) Humphreys and :Mr. Fairfax., and proved by the tests now made, has not sufficient range, and any other conventional sign for rock8, &c., above 45°, (which, its advocat,es contend, is a recognized part of his system,) is

THE UNITED STATES COAST SCRVEY.

227

deemed inferior to hachuring where hills of rock formation are unbroken in surface, which is common in nature. 2. Capt. Humphreys' s scale has strength and range, without a sufficient variefy, and lacks contrast between important slopes. 3. Mr. Fairfax's scale is a comliinal 1011 of otl1ers, and Las been carefully studied and constructed. The subject was taken up by him for the same reason which led to the present investigation, viz: the inadequateness of other scales. The system and p hilo,:ophy of his scale are excellent, and have been taken as the basis of the new scale proposed; but in the extreme ranges, both of the upper and lower slopes, he has carried his lines and spaces to an impract.icable degree of fineness. The new scale proposed is based upon the strong aud effective line of Lehman, from 5:.:i to 25°, its best section, and from 25° to 40° it follows the line or curve of natural sines. This gives at 5° a proportion of one part of black to eight of white, and at 40° four partt'l of black to one of white. Within this range the scale has been found to answer all practical demands . in representing natural contour, and is considered the be1:>t gradation of light and shade which experiment could develop. Beyond these well known and mathematical bases the scale is extended in the higher range to 75°, and in the lower range to 1°. This has been dolle by continuing the same strength of line, as at 5°, with an increase of 25 per cent. of white for each degree from 4° to 1°, inclusive, which gives a distinct yet pleasing contrast between these important slopes. In the higher range the unit of black is increased 25 per cent. for the first 5°, and 25 per cent. each foi; the next three divisions of 10°, leaving the last 15:.:i of slope from 15° to 90° in full black. This construction and arrangement has been the result of careful and labored practical experiment, both in drawing and engraving, and it is believed that the scale in its whole range wilJ be found practicable in execution and graphic in effect. There is nothing original in this scale, and no merit is claimed for it other than in the experiments which led to its adoption; they have been the same which I 1rnve endeavored to apply to all the subjects under examination and revision during my winter's duty, and based upon the principle that one fact is worth many metaphysical opinions and theories. I have had great assistance from Mr. E. Hergesheimer t11roughout the whole of this investigation, and aided by his experience, judgment, and artistic skiH. :Mr. .McCoy has also devoted his attention to the 1mbject, and his practical 11pplication of the new scnle to the engraved specimen of a portion of Cape Ann bas been one of the most valuable and satisfactory auxiliaries in our operations. I append a report of :Mr. Hergesbeimer's on the details of the scale given, with original and photographed specimens. Also a photographed copy of the experimental drawing8, with a copy of the engraved example by Mr. McCoy. All of which is respectfully submitted. Very respect.fully, yours,

DEAR Sm : I respectfully report herewith the results of our experiments of applying the

different scales of shade to the same hill curves. 1. Capt. Humphreys' 8 1JCale gives so much importance to the range from 0 to 5°, with so little shade in the higher slopes, that too little modulation of shade is left in the range from 50 to 20° to produce the graphic effect demanded by the s o };.," Coast Survey maps. This latter range (from 5"' to 20") being the slope most frequently met with on our coast.

228

2. Lehman's scale has much in it that is valuable and desirable to retain. The graduation of shade from 5° to 25° produces the best effect possible, in order to leave sufficient shade before 5° and after 20° for the lower and higher slopes. This is the portion of it which Assistant W. M. C. Fairfax has retained in his valuable scale. 3. The scale based upon the proportions of natural, sines has also been e:x:amined and found to fail in its effect in the most important slopes, (those from 5° to 20°.) It is entirely too light from 0 to 10°, and being of equal proportions of black and white at 30° leaves too little Bhade from 10° to 30°. 4. Mr. Fairfax's scale, which continues with Lehman's from 5° to 25°, and then, by a line parallel to the curve of natural Bines, terminates in a horizontal tangent at 60°, is found to produce an effect Buperior to the others mentioned. It has been found desirable, however, for the best representation of the higher and lower slopes to modify this scale below 5° and above 40°, leaving the intermediate range unchanged. The lines of llfr. Fairfax's scale, below 4°, if practicable, are of a fineness very difficult to engrave; again at 40° he exhausts so much of the white (on 8 " ~"" scale, unity 100 to the im:l1) that it is not desirable to attempt to 1>how any less quantity. The engraver can easily cut a line finer than that given by Mr. Fairfax at 5°, but more than one shade below 5° sbould not be attempted. So in all slopes below 5° it is found best to use the same line aud open the hachures as follows: For 4° with a line rfoo of an inch thick, open 25 per cent.

APPENDIX No. 21.
A resolutionprovidingfor the observation ef the edipse of the sun, on the 18th day

of

July, 1860.

Resolved iYiJ tile Senate and House ef Representatives ef the United States of .America in Congress assembkd, That the Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey be, and he hereby is, authorized and directed to furnish a vessel and provisions for the conveyance to the most suitable point on the eastern coast of this continent for observing the total eclipse of the sun, which will occur .::in the eighteenth day of July next, of astronomers, not exceeding five in number, and their a.-sistants, to be selected by the said Superintendent of the Coast Survey: Provided, That the United States shall not be liable to any other charge on account of the said astronomers and their assistants than their conveyance and provisions, as herein provided, and that they shall furnish their observations for the use of the Coast Survey, without further charge to the government. Approved June 15, 1860.

Report to the Superintendent ef the United States Coast Survey on the expedition to Labrador t-0 observe tlie toted eclip..~e ef July 18, 1860, organized under act ef Congress approved June 15, 1860, by PrefeBsor Stephen A.l.exander, LL.D., ef tlte College of New Jersey.
SIR: As astronomer in charge of the expedition sent out under the auspices of the United States Coast Survey, to observe the total eclipse of the sun of July 18, 1860, I beg leave re. spectfully to report that, in furtherance of the objects of the expedition, the northern extremity of Aulezavik island-very nearly in the path of the central eclipse-was selected as being the position in the vicinity of which our station was to be sought. We reached the place in question on Friday evening, July 13. On our arrival we found the aspect of the coast to be bold and rugged in the ext1·eme. It in effect presented the appearance of a nearly uninterrupted chain of mountains of awful grandeur. Even the occasiopal lower elevations among them had the aspect of being enormously difficult of access. But another and utterly discouraging obstacle had already manifested itself for several miles before we reached the point in question. The mountains of this lold coast were themselves partially covered with snow, and all along the bat.les of those rnountain8 reposed a quiet, welldefined belt of mist; though the sea further from the shore was free from the same, and the sky superbly clear. This rendered it at once evident that a position fully opeu to the ocean was not for one moment to be thought of, but that, on the contrary, if a suitable station were attainable at all in that vicinity, it must be one between which and the ocean the mountains themselves should interpose ao effectual barrier to an interference continually to be reproduced under the same law of condense.tion. With this view, the inlet around the northern portion of the island was

230

REPORT OF THE BL'PERINTENDENT 01''

penetrated and examined, with the hope of attaining a station which should at once be free from mist, and at the same time afford (in the judgment of the commander) a safe harbor for the steamer, which would otherwise be much exposed. This investigation was decided upon, with the approbation of my associates, though it was foreseen that if even eucccssful, we should in all probability find ourselves to the south, but, as we hoped, not much south, of the path of the centre. Our alternative was to pass considerably further to the north, to prosecute a precisely similar investigation there, and that in the immediate vicinity of the most dangerous portion of the., coast which we had yet seen, and in the event of no success to double Cape Chudleigh, and seek for our station somewhere in the vicinity of Ungava bay. This, apart from other considerations, would have involved the loss of much of our remaining and increasingly precious time, and such an increased consumption of the coal on hand as might have seriously inconvenienced, if not indeed hazarded, our safe return, though the steamer, on quitting the harbor of Sidney, had taken all the coal that she could well carry, and, through the providence of her commander, a schooner had been chartered to meet us with a new supply, on our return voyage, at a point about halfway down from our station to Sidney. Penetrating carefully, therefore, the inlet (see Sketch No. 38) in a direction a little towards the southwest, we soon found what presented the appearance of a fine plateau, but which proved, upon investigation, to afford a series of terraces, admitting of a great variety of elevation if belts of fog should be found to interfere, and also shut out, by what proved to be a double range of mountains, from the intrusion of the ocean mist. The efficiency of this barrier in this very respect exceeded my highest expectations, the mist creeping over, indeed, and descending below the 1ops of the highest hills, and yet, under ordinary circumstances, but rarely finding its way, even hy small portions, within the area thus defended. The harbor thus shielded was, moreover, (in the judgment of the commander,) admirable, the holding ground especially good. The elevation of the principal station above the level of the sea is 110 feet, while the peaks behind this are 2, 150 and 1, 7 29 feet high, respectively. These heights were determined by Prof. Venable, Dr. Barnard, and Mr. Lieber, as is stated in Prof. Venable's report to me, hereto annexed. The latitude of the principal station, at which a small temporary observatory, containing the transit instrument, &c., had been erected, as determined by the observations of Lient. Ashe, Prof. Smith, and myself, was found to be 59° 4 7' 49 11 N.; and the longitude at present apparent upon comparison of the standard chronometer (Dent, 2602) with the local time is 4h. 16m. 538. west of Greenwich.* It seems not inappropriate to insert in this place the report of the frequent comparisons of chronometers made in duplicate by Mr. Goodfellow and myself, the results of the several com· parisons being marked with the appropriate initials to indicate the respective observers: A., Alexander; G., Goodfellow; and in one or two instances, T., Thompson. In the instance of the standard (Dent, 2602) and that of the sidereal chronometer, (Hutton, 207,) the times indicated by each at the same date are given, while for all the others the differ· ence between the chronometer in question and the standard is given, this diflerence being always that of time of chronometer compared minus that of the standard; so that denotes fast; ~, slo\v.

REPORT OF THE SlTPERINTENDENT OF

The chronometer employed in making our observations was Bond & Son, 177. A combination of observations made by Lieut. Ashe, Prof. Smith, and myself, gave for the error of this chronometer at the time of the total eclipse: chronometer too.fast for mean time (civil reckoning) at the place of observation 4h. 5Im. 58.92.s; while another combination of consistent reomlts of my own observations, made both before and after the meridian passages of the sun, gave for the error at the same epoch 4h. 51 m. 57. 86s.; the mean of the two is 4h. 51 m. 58.39s. This must be in!!rcased 0.36s. if the equation of time as given in the American Nautical Almanac be made use of instead of that given in the British N. Almanac. As soon after we left New York as was found to be convenient I called together all who were expecterl to take a part in the observations, and gave them an exposition of the phenomena to be >:ought for, illustrating my remarks b:· reterence to numerous diagrams as I proceeded. After this a special assignment of all the observations was proposed, and as far as might be settled. My secretary, Mr. Henry, then made careful copiP.s of the several programmes, and they were distributed severally to tho:;e to whom they belonged. Several matters alluded to in each were also further elucidated by me in personal communication with the observers themselves. Thµ, special assignmeDt was finally made as follows, agreeing in many respects with the pre· liminary arrangement made in conference at Washington: The transit ob1:1ervations 'vere assigned to Lieut. A.she. We had completed our selection of station and made some preliminary observations on Sahu· day, the 14th. On Monday the temporary observatory already alluded to was set up. Lieut. Aslte took up his lodgment with his instruments on shore, while Prof. Venable and l\Ir. Lieber took up their quarters in a tent at the meteorological station; and Messrs. Goodfellow and Walker had their magnetic observatory and encampment completed, they having, indeed, made some arrangements on Saturday. The preliminary arrangements of the meteorologists were, blown down, but were restored on the following Monday. Lieut. AsLe met with so many obstacles from the interference of daylight, great fickleness of the weather, and almost. continmtl clouds at night, and sometimes also from storms, to say nothing of unexpected mechanical difficulties and olistacles, that, after a persevering and faithful trial, he waR compelled to abandon the hope of any result from the transit instrument, aml we were obliged to trust to our sextants only. To Mr. Henry was assigned the charge of calling the seconds of time audibly whenever re· quired, while the passing minute was watched for and furnished by :Mr. Fisher, one of the engineer's assistants. Mr. Henry was likewise so to arrange as to note the intensity of light during the total obscura· tion of the sun, by ascertaining the distances at which printed books and the chronometer could be read. The other special arrangements were as follows:

To Lieut. Ashe, Prqf. Smith, and myself, associated as time observer3 :
Before the beginning: 1. YiRibility of the border of the moon before she touches the sun. Time and distance at ·which the same may occur. 2. Agitation of the sun's lirub before tLe first contact in the region where the first contact may be anticipated. At or about the 1ime of beginning: (a.) Time and position of the first contact. 3.

This division of labor will be especially necessary during the brief period (3:i- minutes) of the total eclipse.

To Jfr. French, chief engineer :
Approach of the shadow from the west just before the total eclipse, as seen in the darkening of both tLe sky and the earth; and whether dark stripes are not seen flitting across the landscape just before the eclipse is total; and whether there is not a tremor of the last visible Learn of the sun. Force and direction of the wind; whether it is increased, or not, ai:; the total eclipse comes on; and whether it blows from the shadow as the shadow approl-tches, and again back from the shadow as it recedes; and whether there is a lull in the middle. Whether either the aurora or comet is visible. Flight of the shadow eastward.

To Mr. Nones, assistant engineer:
The approach of the shadow from the west, as seen by its darkening the sky and the landscape. Tint of the sky, especially overhead; also that of the clouds, and the direction of the clouds. If any stars are noticed, to observe their color, especially that of one near the zenith; see, especially, if any be red. To notice if them are any traces of the aurora borealis. To observe the intensity of the light during the total eclipse, by noting how near the eye mm'\t be brought to see the seconds on a chronometer; also, how near tho eye must be brought to read several sizes of print, marking the distance in inches at the bottom of the page in pencil; and remembering or noting also the distance for the chronometer, and whether the light increases towards the middle of the eclipse. Flight of the shadow eastward. Then, as soon as may be after the total eclipseTo notice whether the flowers have closed their blossoms.

To Mr. Osborne, surgeon's steward:
1. Electrical observations. 2. Approach of the shadow from the west, as seen by the darkening of the sky and landscape. 3. Force and direction of the wind; especially whether the wind is increased as the dark shadow approaches, and is from the shadow as t.he shadow approaches, and again back from the shadow as it recedes; and whether there is a lull in the middle. 4. Whether there are any traces of the aurora Lorealis; or whether the comet can Le seen, or any red stars. 5. Whether the circle of light around the moon appears broader towards any one side; and, if so, which? At the suggestion of Professor Venable, I also drew up a list of phenomena to be looked for by the seamen. It wag committed to the care of Lieut. Comg. Murray, who kindly undertook

238

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

to have it properly communicated to the seamen.

Through him, also, I received their report, which will be found to contain some valuable items, and which appears in its proper place. The programme which I prepared for them is as follo-ws:

To be noted by the seamen :
1. The fading of the light, and the color of the sky, clouds, and landscape. 2. Whether they can see a star a little below and to the right of the sun before the eclipse_ is total, and for a little while after the sun begins to be seen again . .After the eclipse is total: 3. Color of the sky, the landscape, and the clouds. 4. How many stars they can see, and their color; if any were red when they saw them. 5. Tho approach of the shadow, as shown by the darkening of the sky and landscape towards the west. The degree of darkness; to be noted by seeing how near, in inches, the eye must be brought to read a printed page; the number of inches to be marked on the book, so as to be recorded afterwards. Dark and light stripes flying over the ground just before the total eclipse. Also, the quivering of the last beam of the sun just before it disappears. 6. At the same time, the like motion in the edges of the shadows: perhaps, too, the edges of the shadows may be colored. 7. Size of the bright ring around the moon; noticing whet.her the ring is a quart6r as broad aR the dark moon, or twice as broad, or how many times. 8. Whether the force of the wind is increased as the shadow approaches; and whether the wind then blows towards us from the shadow; and whether, as the shadow leaves it blows back to us again from it; and whether there is a lull in the middle of the to.tal eclipse.

Description if the telescopes emp!,oyed.

The telescopes were all achromatic refractors. That made use of by myself was made by Utschneiderand Fraunhofer, aperture nearly three inches; focal length of object glass, fifty· one inches; amplifying power about eighty, for the partial eclipse. That used at the total obscuration not yet determined; aperture reduced when the sun was bright. Dr. Barnard used the telescope obtained from Columbia College, New York; aperture three inche1>1; focal length, forty-five inches. Lieutenant Ashe used a forty-two-inch Dolland, aperture (probably) not far from three inches; amplifying power about forty. Profesl!!or Smith had a telescope by PlOssl of three inches aperture and thirty-two inches focal length; diagonal eye piece; amplifying power not yet ascertained. Professor Venable, a Dollond of about forty inches focal length of object glass; aperture three and a half inches, nearly; amplifying power not yet ascertained. Lieutenant Commanding Murray, for some observations, made use of a large comet seeker, by Fritz; aperture, seven and a half inches; focal length, five feet; power low. For other observations he made use of the telescope of a sextant, as hereafter described. The photographers made use of a five feet refractor by Fritz; aperture four and a half inches. (This description, though confessedly imperfect, is all that can at present be given.) 'l'he telescopes had secure foundations constructed of sand, gravel, and large stone; sometimes packed hard in boxes and portions of casks to bind the supportslaterally; then,such as required to be adjusted equatorially were brought nearly into place on the day before the eclipse, and

although the sudden outburst of stormy weather compelled a partial dismounting of tte instruments the same evening, yet all wero in place for a preliminary drill next morning. The construction and arrangement of a separate building for a camera obscura could not be effected until almost at the last moment, when there was so much else to do. Then, to my very great regret, I found that our spare telescope, already in place, did not admit of such an adjustment of the eye piece as would give a distinct imago; I spent some minutes of the last preparatory hour in trying to arrange it, but without success; so that, although we had a divided circle, and a vertical and a horizontal movement of screen, all ready for marking positions, I was compelled to abandon the whole. A brisk wind, W. by S., seemed to be carrying the floating clouds before it, and this, together with the breaking of the clouds, gave an almost immediate prospect of a clear sky behind them, and thus gave us hopes that tho phenomena might be successfully observed, especially if the wind should somewhat abate; for when the weather became clear at all, our experience had shown it to be very clear.* The violence of the wind did, indeed, abate, but the clouds were not all dispersed, though large openings appeared. How far the clouds interfered will, however, be gathered from the synopsis herewith presented of the observations themselves. SYNOPSIS OF THE OBSERVATIONS. 1. In accordance with the plan already exhibited, the moon was sought for before the first contact, by Dr. Barnard and Lieut. Comg. Murray, but without success. 2. Agitation ef the sun's limb nea" to tlwpoint ef first contact.-An agitation of the sun's limb, near to the computed point of first contact, was suspected by me some seconds before the indentation was observed, but the appearance was not sufficiently decided to be accepted as real.

(4.) Brigid band bordering that edge of the moon ichich icas prqjected on t11e 8un'.s disc.This phenomenon, first noticed by myself in 1831, and to which I have on variom· occat1ion,; called the attention of others, was Yisihle on thii; occasion in my telescope at about Sh. 13m.,* and especially at Sh. 17m. 15s. The phenomenon was more distinctly visible through the green and the lilue screens, resp cc ti vcly, than J;hose which were violet or neutral, and above all through that of an orange tint. Again, at 9h. 39~1n., the orange colored screen showed the phenomenon by for tlie bcd~thcn violet, green, blue, in their order; neutral tint the least. Prof. Venable saw the sun brighter along tlte bordei· of the moon, though he hesitates to call the appearance a bright band; time, Slt. 151n. 10s,.· and at several other times in the progress of the eclipse saw it through green and through orange screens, respectively. Prof. Smith remarked, after the fin;t immersion, and till the moon approached a dark spot, a yellow band separated from the white liglit of the sun by a distinctly dad~ line. This be states was seen in the centre of the -field, and was not due to any lack of achromatism there, at 9'1. 36m. 17s. Prof. Smith again saw the light, in connection with a peculiar illumination of tl1e moon's disc, to be more fully described hereafter. He made use of a diagonal eye-piece, as before stated, and his 8creen glass exhibited a neidral tint. Lieut. Commanding Murray noted, at 9h. 31 m. l 3s., a bright yellow border; and at 'Jh. 44m. lls. a bright edge around the moon; 't. e., the part of it projected on the sun's disc. Also a discernible line around the portion of the edge yet remaining vrojected nt 'Jh. 4Gm.. 30~. It will be remembered that his telescope was the large comet-seeker; his .~creen glass had a ud color. The phenomenon in question is distinctly represented in the photographic plates; the light from near the border ef tlte sun being most perceptibly affected-as I have heretofore had occasion to observe in other instances. Photography has also before this confirmed all that is here related. The bright band is unquestionably pictured in the copies of daguerreotypes of the eclipsed sun taken at Mr. Campbell's observatory in New York, under the supervii;.ion of hfr. Campbell and Prof. Loomis, in May, 1854. (5.) Roughness ef the moon' 8 edge, and a distortion ef the cusps (one or both) qf tl1e uneclipsed portion of the sun.-This roughness is distinctly represented in photographic plate No. 1, which was taken a few seconds after the beginning of the eclipse; and in other of those plates, taken when the light along the moon's edge came from near the suu's border. Lieutenant Ashe mentions two high mountains of the moon, which be saw at the immersion, just under the upper cusp. A distortion of the sun's (apparent) upper cusp was not.iced by Professor Venable at Sit. 15m. 10s., (screen glass green;) also at Sh. 59rn., (screen glass orange;) again, at 9h. 4m. Gs.,

Professor 8mith says that the concavity of the (apparent) lower portion of the crescent appeared irregnl;ir. It was indented in two places; and at 9/t. 6m. another indentia· tion \Vas seen forther up, it being about twice as far from the cusp as the second of the preceding ones, (tlrnt seen at 9h. 5m. ;) diagonal eye-piece, (Rcreen glasR neutral.)

At 9h. 33m. 56s.

Lieut.. Comg. :Murray reports rough edges at lOh. Him. Irregularities were also noticed by Dr. Barnard. It may be observed, in general, that the roughness was the most strikingly conspicuous of all a very short time before the total obscuration, when all the light was border light, as will be more particularly described in ( 10.) (6.) Contact 'With 8olar spot8.-At -h. -m. 148., a contact; observer, Lieut. Comg. Murray. At Sh. 20m. 36s., contact with the penumbra of a large spot, but vision was indistinct on account of a cloud; observer, Professor Smith. At Sh. 21m. 98. to 1 Js., my own notes mention a contact with a penumbra; slight cloud passing. At Sh. 21 m. 2Ss., immersion of a large spot; Professor Venable: also at 9h. lrn. 20s. the apparent lower one of two, and the upper one at 9h. lm. 58s. began to be submerged; and the upper one was entirely covered at 9h. 4m. 6s. My own notes mention, at 9h. lm. 25s., contact with the penumbra of a spot; at 9h. lm. 36s., contact with the dark spot; at 9h. lm. 50s., immersion of the same; at 9h. lm. 59s., immersion of penumbra. At 9h. lm. 30s., Dr. Barnard observed the immersion of a spot. At 9h. Im. 34s., Professor Smith reports a contact with a small spot in the (apparent) SW. quadrant, (actua11y SE.;) at 9h. Im. 48s., the spot was totally obscured. At 9h. lm. 53s., and 9h. 2m. Ss., Dr. Barnard again reports immersions; and Prof. Smith, at 9h. Im. 58s., a contact with second small spot; at 9h. 2m. 5s., a contact with lower one of the group. The following are reported by Lieutenant Ashe: contacts at 9li. 2m. 10s., and 9h. 2m. 33s. Emcrsions were observed, at 9h. 29m. 44s., of a spot, and at 9h. 30m. 26s., of a border of a spot, by Dr. Barnard; at 9h. 29m. 53s., centre of a spot, by Lieutenant .A.she; and Prof. Venable observed the emersion of a large spot at 9ii. 29m. 54s.

(7.) Flashes or corruscalions ef light across the moon.-Professor Smith remark;; that, at 9h. 12m., the entry wa;; made in his note-book of blue flashes, but that he is unable to recall or locate them. (8.) Illumination, or peculiar cdor ef the moon's clisc.-Professor Smith reports that, at 9h. 9m., a narrow red line or band ·was seen skirting the moon's border, and apparently on tho moon's surface. He says, moreover, that,'' at 9h. 36m. 17s., the moon pre:,;ented, more distinctly than any time before, the appearance of a hemisphere, and the definition of all portions of the phenomenon more perfod, as if seell through tl1e most µerfectly transparent atmosphere. .A.t this time a blue band of considerable brettdth surrounded that portion of the moon 'Yhieh covered the sun. This band appeared to be made of radiation:; of blue light of diffe1 ent degrees of intensity, in a direction perpendicular to tlte sun's surface. It was bounded by a well-defined line on the moon's surface. I was instantly reminded of the 'mirage' l'-O frequently witnessed on our voyage to this place, in which the horizon appeared to be skirted by a blue sea-wall. Tbe resemblance to an unhroken sheet of water, (varying in thickness or irregularit.'- of surface so as to vary the shading,) falling over a mill-dam, occurred to me. At the base, where it was in contact with the sun, was a very narrow band or line of yellow light, as noticed in diagram ~o. 2;" (our own, No. 4, sketch No. 39.) Diagonal e:re-piece; (screen glass neutral.) The effect of this is distinctly and beautifully registered on photographic plates Nos. 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively, as is stated also by lf. Dnchochois and Mr. Thompson in their report. At 9k. 38m, 13s. Lieutenant Comg. Murray reports ''a bright yellow border to the moon;'' and, at 9k. 44m. 11.<;., ''a discernible line around the edge of moon in contact'' with the sun's disc, as already stated in (4.) I have received from Professor Smith the following additional notice of these phenomena, under the date of November 3. He says:
"At the time that the whole hemisphere of the moon towards the earth was visible, the appearance was that of the rough surface of the ocean just at late twilight in the evening, with one's back to the west. "The appearance of the water in one of the stereoscopic views of an iceberg, when seen with rat11er faint light, resembles the appearance of the moon at the time. The Lackground was that of very early dawn-a slightly roseate hue, fa<ling away into indistinctness from the sun. The moon appeared to hang out in space midway between us and the sun. No object was ever made to stand out more completely in a stereoscopic picture than did the moon. The duration was not more than two seconds. It disappeared as by a diminished transparency of the atmosphere at first, and then came those floating clouds which annoyed us so much. "I regret that it did not occur to me to be more specific on this point when I made my partial-or, as I t1-upposed, informal-report when on the ground. No memorandum was made· of the phenomenon at the time. I had just cast my eye down on my book to record the appearance of the blue band, and, on looking in the instrument again, the view so overwhelmed

me tliat I was for some time lost to every other consideration. It haunted my mind continually afterwards, and often now returns with great vividness.'' It, ought, as it seems to me, to be noted, in this connection, that Professor Smith's eye wa;;, of all those of our company, the least sensible to color, under ordinary circumstances. (9.) Projection of the moon's disc beyond that of t/w sun. -As I liad, as I thought, ascertained tliat, in other instances, this phenomenon could be bettor seen when the image of the sun, reflected from oil, was viewed with a telescope, instead of the sun itself, Lieut. Comg. Murray, at my request, made use of nn artificial horizon of oil, defondc"d from tho wind by the ordinai'y pent-house, as intimated in the programme furnished to him. Viewing the sun in this way with the telescope of sextant, Lieut. Commanding Murray, at fJlt. 44m. lls., saw the moon's disc extending beyond the sun's cusps some 15° on both sides. Acting Sailing :Master Platt repeated the observation witl1 the same instrument, and with a similar result, (screen glass rose colol'.) ~1mong my own notes I find this phenomenon mentioned as having been seen at 9li. 43m. 10s., (screen blue;) also at 9h. 45m. 18s.; extent about 8° from tho upper cusp, (e1·ect view;) screen glass neutral. At 9h. 43m. 44s., Prof. Smith speaks of a bluish light flashing around the lower limb of the moon from the suu' s disc, having a curYature the same with that of the moon, seeming for a moment to reveal the border of the moon beyond the sun's disc. (Diagonal eye-piece; screen neutral.) Lieut. Ashe could frequently follow the edge of the moon off the sun 3° or 4°, mentions the pl1enomenon especially in connectiou \Yi th that of the breaking off of the (apparent) lower cusp at 911. 33rn. 5f5.s. (10.) Brmking ef the Vif>ible portiooi ef lhe sun info fragments a very short time before the total obscuralfon. Dark lines; Baily beads.-This was a very striking and beautiful phenomenon. Some seconds before the last remnant vanished it became rongh and jagged; all the remaining portion of the sun presenting in its inner outline very accurately the appearance of the bright portion of the moon as seen in the telescope as soon as she is visible after the new mooni the southern cusp withal being that most affected. (Fig 5, Sketch No. 39.) It was not until the crescent-i;haped fragment became vel'y narrow that the phenomenon became conspicuous. I did not observe any tflndency to the formation of the "Baily beads," but the remnant of the sun seemed to be broken up and melted away, as a highly ignited metal might be under the influence of intense heat, the whole being very similar to the beautiful rupture of tho narrow ring of the annular eclipse which I saw in 183l. The actually inferi01: brightne1:<s of the sun's border light and the constantly recurring veil of passiug clouds together made it possible for me to contemplate thew hole without the iutervention of a screen. Lieut. Aslie ah;o removed bis screen glass eight minutes before the total obscuratioll. At 'Jh. 7 m. 1Ss.; Prof. Venable observed " the formation of a bead" at the upper (southern) cusp; "saw two or three form;"* (screen glass probably green.) Prof. Smith states that at 9h. 12m. 42s., dark lines appeared, dividing the (apparent) upper portion of the fine silvery line of the sun's disc, giving to it a fragmentary appearance; the lower portion was indistinct, being partially concealed by clouds. (Diagonal eye-piece; screen neutral.) The times at which I myself marked the early apptoarance and subsequent progress of the phe11omenon in question were very nearly as follows: 9h. 11m. 17s., 9h. l3m. 17s., 9h. 13in. 25s., the last. mentioned date being about six seconds previous to the t'Otal immersion. Lieut. Ai:lhe remarks that when the bright crescent was reduced to a thin line of light it was

a beautiful object to behold, extend1ng about 130° round the edge of tho moon; and he add:3 that shortly afterwards it broke up into fragmeuts. (11.) Rapid cltangeB in tlte laBt Vi8iUle .fragments and ngitation, or quivering of the la8t beams of lig!d.-Lieut. Ashe says of the fragments into whicb he saw tht; remnaiit broken that "they seemed to swim from the centre towards the eui<ps." (l\~o screen.) The report of tl1e seamen stationed on ship l1oard, as rendered by Purser's Steward Collins, speaks of the quivering of the beams, but as being very slight. 12. Appearance qf dark: or variegated stripes pa88ing across tl1c landscape, and a~ritati011 qf i!te same.-The report of Pur,.,er' s Steward Collins also says: " We saw a few shades iu the S. SE.," (magnetic, i.e., E. bys.,) and .. we observed a slight quivering in the shadows as they flitted across the landscape, and that likewise they were of diffm·cnt colors; red, green, and a yellowish white." ( 13.) Diminution of light a.s ihe eclipse advcrnccd, and appcarancc8 dtiring the total eclipse of U,e .mn.-At Sh. 3Hm., Lieut. Commanding Murruy uotcs the darkness us having been first perceptible . .My own notes mention that at 8li. 38m. 458., the sky was deepening its blue, and at Sh. 45m., the color is described as being smaltz l)lne.· .At 871. 58m., it had a purple tint. Those several appearances are those of the sk;v as seen bebYeen the patches of very white clouds. Dr. Barnard describes the change as being "the waning of lJrilliancy into something like the feeble and ineffectual radiance so observable occasionally in tlie winter days of New England;" and adds that "after this the daylight took on a more lurid character; tlie landscape appeared dull and c11eerlesR, yet I could not perceive any change in tints of the objects at hand." "The sky," be says, "was very beautiful. At Sh. 38m., l was very much struck with the intense blue of the sky overhead, aml also iu the interstices of the cloud" in the vicinity of the sun.'' "Tl1e clouds themselves being fleecy and thin presented a vast variety of fantastic forms of the intensest and purest white, and these by their strong contrast brought out the deep tint of the sky more strikingly. At the hour just named the clouds covered about nine-tenths of the 11eavens. ' 1 At about "9h. 8m.," or "just before the total immersi0n, I once more noticed the tint of the uncovered sky, and found its darkness greatly increased. It was still purely blue, but with a depth of azure almost equal to that of the ocean." At Dk. 7 m., Prof. Venable speaks of the blue-green tints of the mountains, and the deeper one of their shadows as being very beautiful. Lieut. Ashe sayR (about Sm., before the total eclipse:) "At this time I looked round upon acveral objects that were highly illuminated by the sun bcforn, but now a great change had taken place; a gloomy, unearthly light fell upon all objects, impressing me with the idert that some fearful calamity was about to happen; and I can well imagine that armies engaged in deadly strife would lay down their arms when nature cast so ghastly a light upon the battle· field." From the various accounts of Acting Sailing-Master Platt, the assistant engineer, :Mr. Nones, the surgeon's steward, M:r. Osborne, and the seamen's report made by Purser's Steward Collins, we obtain very similar information as to the deepening tint of hlue of the sky. The clouds are spoken of as grey . .At the time qftotal obscuration.-Just before the total obscuration, Mr. Henry observed that the clouds in the region of the sun were of a copper color, and when the total obscuration had taken place we may gather from the various descriptions in the appended reports, that the clouds at a considerable altitude had a: leaden color, while nearer to the horizon, and especially to the regions north and south, which seemed to be beyond the dark shadow, red and a beautiful

orange color were predominant, the rich orange being most conspicuous near to the southern horizon, and the red towards the north. "The redness of the horizon," says Dr. Barnard, "was remarkable in the north chiefly, perJrnps because the north was the only point of the compass which furnished a horizon down to the sea. Looking in that direction the appearance was very like what we see nightly at about 11 o'clock.'' "It is, however, to be observed that the obscuration of the greater part of the heavens, and particularly of the region of tbe sun by clouds, contributed to the remarkable resemblance between their light and twilight. In the northern horizon there happened to be but few clouds.'' ''But while the aapect of the lower heavens bore so strong a Rimilarity to the ordinary appearance of twilight, it cannot be said that the general aspect of nature, or the kind of illumination that prevailed was devoid of a certain singularity which it is difficult to describe, and which I have nevet" witnessed under other circnrnstances." "It was on this account that, remembering the statements which have been made of tho funereal gloom and death-like pallor observed in similar moments before, I looked carefully at the faces of those who were nearest to me, in order .to detect, if possible, any such traces there.'' "I perceived no such change in any of the countenances about me." Mr. Lieber speaks of the clouds to the east as being purple. Lieut. .Ashe says "the light is totally different from that of morning and evening." These phenomena strongly resembled those described by Mr. C. Piazzi Smith, the astronomer royal of Edinburg, in his account of observations made at Bue island, Norway, in July, during the total eclipse of 1851; and the whole appearance was exceedingly like that which lie has so finely delineated. (Edinburg .A8t. 01s., vol. XI, page 275, and flate No. 7.) (13 bis.) In connection with this accom1t of the diminution of ligllt, it may be mentioned that at 10/i. 8m., when the sun was yet partially eclipsed, the solar faculffi appeared with uncommon distinctness on a part of the sun in the ueighborhood of the moon, and towards the upper cusp, though still some distance from the sun's border. (First noticed by Lieut. Ashe, and then and later by all or nearly all the observers. See reports.) (14.) .Approach and departure of tlie dark shadow.-Acting Sailing-Master Platt, whose attention bad been particularly directed to these in the programme of phenomena to be looked for, saw the darkness advance from the west with a frightful rapidity, and then pass over. It appeared like a dark column or a very dark cloud. Mr. Nones speaks of the latter part of the shadow as being of a ''dark rose color, which could be traced in the valley below.'' The approach of the light following the shadow was very distinctly to be marked. (15.) Intensity ef light during the total obscuration if the sun.-Lieut. Ashe remarks that the degree of darkness was not so great as he would have imagined; he could see the remarks in his note·book without much difficulty. Dr. Barnard says: ''The darkness was not such as to incommode me in performing a!1Y ordinary work. I looked up the bay towards the north, and could have distinguished persons and boats at a great distance." Found that he could write with a pencil, and read what he had written with great facility: found no difficulty in reading his notes in any position. Prof. Venable found that in order to read a newspaper he was obliged to bring it within four inches of his eyes; much nearer than usual. Mr. Henry read a part of Dr. Hayes' Arctic Boat Journey with which he was not familiar, at a distance of six inches, and a much smaller type (about the size of that of which specimens a.re given by Mr. Nones in his report) at four inches di.stance.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

247

At about this same distance he could distinguish the marks on t11e face of the chronometer. He used a lamp when calling the time by it. :Mr. Thompson read the fine print of which he has given a specimen at the distance of four inches; about half of that at which he usually reads; found it easier to i·ead in the midnight twilight in the harbor. (See his report.) Mr. Nones noticed tho distances at ·which he read the two specimens attaclrnd to his report as being ten and six inches, respectively. Purser's Steward Collins could bnt just discern from the 1;teamer' s deck the black tops of the mountains which surrounded him. (16.) The corona; its peci1liarities as to e'J.:terior outline, eccentricity, &c.-As already stated in the extract from the report of Dr. Barnard, nine-tenths of the sky was covered with clouds; in corniequence of this only one of the astronomers (Lieut. Ashe) caught a glimpse of any portion of the corona. Lieut. Ashe says that "at 27<. 5m. 32.s., (9h. 13m. 33. 2s., mean time,) the last spot of light vanished, and a bright halo surrounded that part of the moon that I was looking at; and at about 20° in the second quadrant I saw a white flame shooting up to a consideraLle distance." His standard of reference was the vertical. (See his sketch or figure 6, of Sketch No. 39.) He used no screen glass in observing the to1al immersion. '' A dense cloud now passed over the sun, and prevented any further observation being made until the emersion." Yet through an opening made in the clouds the corona was 8een on shipboard by the seamen at a position about three-quarters of a mile to the SW. of our station.* The report of Purser's Steward Collins states that "the size of the ring appeared to be about one-third as broad as the dark moon, and of a bright radiant color, emitting quivering and sparkling beams of ligl1t, but uneven in its size and intensity all around." A drawing was made with tho attempt to justify this de8cription. The same was corrected under the immediate inspection of Mr. Collins, who was very specific in his statements and corrections. He then showed it to those who had witnessed the phenomenon, and they insisted upon one or two amendments, with respect to which he was uncertain, and it was then pronounced to be a very exact picture of what they remembered to have Reen. I consider it therefore to be a reliable representation of the appearance, as viewed without a telescope;+ and all the rather because the beam marked B, in the reduced copy, (Fig. 6, Sketch No. 39,) has the position (for direct vision) in which Lieut . .Ashe saw the white flame shooting up; and the eccentricity of the corona is manifested in the very direction in which it might have been anticipated, (if seen at all,) as we ·were in all probability somewhat to the south of the path of the central eclipse. (17.) Stars seen during ilre total immersion; also their color.-Lieut. Ashe Raw Capella Rhining brightly, but cannot aver that its color was red. Acting Sailing-Master Platt still continued to see Capella at about 9h. 20m., or 3k minutes after the first emersion of the sun's beams from the total eclipse. Mr. Thompson saw Capella shining with a bright white light. The report of the seamen speaks of four stars, one (which seems to have had the position of Venus) they all describe as appearing yellowish. M. Duchochois saw Castor, Pollux, Capella, Venus, and Jupiter. Capella appeared whif,e. (1'1 bis.) The proposed search for the intra-mercurial planet could not be conducted because of the clouds; nor could I examine the peculiar illumination of the planet Venus, as I had myself intended.
About ae far on the other side of us, where I had stationed another observer to notice some of the phenomena, nothing could be seen, 1111 be wa.a in a shower of ra.la. t In this view several of my colleagues agree with me who witnessed the clearness and precision of the statements of Kr. Collins, and the eharacter of bis correctio1111.

-----------The wind was fresh for some time before the eclipse, and all the observers near our station agree in saying that the wind moderated and had arrived uearly at a lull at the time of greatest obscuration, in the midst of which a very sudden gust arose and almost as quickly ceased. (Sec the several appended reports of Mr. Thompson, Mr. Platt, and the seamen.) Chief Engineer French, however, who, at my request, observed on an eminence, found the wind invariably light and from the northwest. He was much more enveloped in clouds than ourselves, and could not trace the other phenomena. (Hl.) Effect on the temperature.-An inspection of the meteorological report hereto appended will show that there was little or no change of temperature during the eclipse. This has also been, in other instances, true, when the sun was not eclipsed, though our experience at our station has been limited. When a change did occur within the same hours of the day, the range amounted to from five to eight degrees. The rise of the thermometer may have been prevented on this occasion. From the observations of the quartermaster it appears that the thermometer, on ship-board, fell seven degrees and afterwards rose five degrees. (20.) Polarization ef the atmasphere.-Several observations of this phenomen-0n will be found detailed in the report of Professor Venable, who used Savart's polariscope. His closing remark is, "I do not think that any conclusions can be drawn from these observations, as to any effect of the eclipse on the polarization of the atmosphere, though no observations were made, in this respect, during the tot.al eclipse." The like conclusion has been drawn by Mr. Lieber from the observations specified in his report, though the intensity in the direction south seemed to be increased about the time of the total eclipse. The view was at all times more obstructed there than that in a.n opposite direct1on. Mr. Lieber used Arago's polariscope.

(21.) Electrical phenomena.-Peltier' s apparatus never gave any indications, though frequently tried on various occasions by several observers. (22.) Photographic impr~ssions of the sun when edipsed and wl1,en not eclip.~Pa.-The perfection and importance of these has already been alluded to, as well as some of the phenomena which they represent. The report of Mr. Duchochois and Mr. Thompson exhibits particulars with regard to times, &c., at which the impressions were taken, and is, withal, specific with respect to all the arrangements, as well aR the preparation of the plates. (23.) Jilffects on animals.-Six ducks which were on shipboard were observed to put their heads under their wings and otherwise arrange themselves for sleep as at the approach of night. But a bird of a species not recognized by mi, of great S\Yeetness of song, was distinctly heard at 9h. Gm. and 9h. l lm. 15s., and again about two minutes later, when the sun was totally eclipsed. The record of observations of Lieut. Comg. Murray is drawn from his notes, made at the time. Copies of the reports of other officers of the steamer, and that of Purser's Steward Collins, which is a synopsis of what the seamen observed, will all he found in their proper places. Meteoro'logical observations.-These have been systematically conducted under the immediate supervision of Prof. Venable, and have been maintained <luring both the voyages outward and and homeward, as well as the stations at which we stopped. The observations were made by Prof. Venable, Mr. Lieber~ and Mr. Henry, a distribution of labor having been made by them in accordance with rules agreed upon among themselves, subordinate to the directions furnished by Prof. Henry; and they have had occasional aid from some of the officers of the steamer. A copy of their report in full is annexed. Magnetic observations.-Appendod also is a copy of an abstract of the report of Mr. Goodfellow, of the observations of himself and Mr. Walker, in which special reference is made to the effect of the eclipse. The magnetic observations were made in accordance with your own special instructions, and the report is therefore to yourself direct; and in like manner they will report in full. Repo1·ts or abstracts from them were called for while the phenomena were yet fresh in the recollection of the observers, and a brief synopsis of the observations and some of their results was inserted in a bottle and buried near the tide station nuder a cairn, in accordance with the plan heretofore made known t-0 you. The paper was signed by myself in character of astronomer in charge of the expedition, and countersigned by Lieut. Comg. Murray, who also made a similar deposit, under the same cairn, of a chart of the harbor. My own account contained a statement of the reasons why the bottle was deposited, and Lieut. Comg. Murray gave directions to the finder of the bottles as to the disposal of their contents. It remains but that I should acknowledge on my own behalf and that of my associates our special obligations to Lieut. Comg. Murray for his hearty co-operation in our observations and all that could promote them, his persevering kindness in promoting, in otlier respects, our comfort and convenience, and our sense of obligation for his prudence and forethought in the midst of a navigation and of weather sometimes eminently hazardous. We would also speak in terms of high commendation of the skill, zeal, and devotion, within his own sphere, of Acting Sailing-Master Platt, especially under the circumstances to which we have already adverted; also of the aid we have derived from the ingenuity and skill of the chief engineer, :M:r. French, and of the ready co-operation of the other officers, whose observations, and even those of the sea.men, we have found to be valuable. I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

REPOHT OF THE

SUPERINT~DENT

OF

Observations on the total eclipse qf the s1tn qf JUly 18, 1860, made at the camp qf il1e Labrador expedition, Aulezavik island. by F. A. P. Barnmd.
My observations were made by the aid of a 45-inch telescope, of three inches aperture, constructed by Utzschneider and Fraunhofor, belonging to Columbia College, New York. In accordance with my instructions, I looked most carefully for any evidence of the approach of the moon's limb to the sun before the actual contact, varying my darkening glasses for the purpose. I could discover no trace of the border of the moon until her actual encroachment upon the sun's bright disc made it manifest. I am satisfied, l10wever, that this negative result is no sufficient evidence that, with different arrangement;;;, the limb might not be earlier visible. With slightly colored glasses, the radiance of the sun itself dazzles the eye_; and with shade::; sufficiently deep to subdue this brigbtnes1>; a conclusive observation on this point appears to be impossible. A telescope, with an opaque disc at the focus just large enough to intercept the sun's light, might allow observation without a Rhade; and, with such an arrangement, it is not impossible that the limb of the moon might be seen projected on the supposed atmospheric envelope of the sun. First conta.ct ef limbs.-The moment I was absolutely certain of a contact between the two bodies I noted the time, which, by the standard chronometer,* wtts lh. Om. lls. ] ought to observe, however, that I perceived the contact before 1 was sure enough of its reality to make a note of it; and, according to my judgment, about 3s. had elapsed after I suspected it before I was sure of it. Tho effect of unequal refraction, in giving a wavy outline to the entire disc of the sun, contributed to this uncertainty. Spots, immersion, &c.-As the eclipse advanced, clouds continually drifting .over the sun very much interrupted observation. I bad prepared in advance a map of th~ spots on the solar disc, made without instrumental measurement, but sufficiently exact to serve as a guide in the observation of their immersions and emersions. Only three immersions, however, were observable by me, and these occurred in a group of spots near to the centre of the sun, at the times, by standard chronometer, as follows: 1st······ · · · · · · · · ·. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · lh. 53m. 29s. 2d ...................····.........·...... lh. 53m. 52s. 3d ...................................... . lh. 54m. 7s. Emersion qf s_pols.-The emersions of the spots were more generally observable than the immen1ions. Still, it was not possible to secure all; and some which, perhaps, might bave been secured, I lost by having my attention directed at the time to other parts of the moon's limb. A very large spot or group of spots in the northwest quadrant (southeast in the tele· scope) was first recognized at 21i. 2lm. 43s., and its last border came into view at 2h. 22m. 25s. Other spots appeared as follows: 2h. 29m. 7s. 2h. 58m. 47s. 3h. 2m. 47s. 2h. 5 lm. 22s. 3/i. Om. 12s. Total immersion and emersion ef the sun.-The total immersion of the sun occurred at 2h. 5m. 28s. It was observed through a veil of clouds not sufficiently dense to cut off the direct rays of the sun, but quite enough so to render any subsequent phenomena invisible until after the emersion had taken place. Fading of the sunliyld.-The eclipse had not. far advanced before the diminished brigntriess of the solar light became very obvious. Except for the floating clouds, the atmosphere was

clear, and before the eclipse began we had the cheerful and vigorous brightness of a summer day. From this, the first marked appearance of cha11ge was the war:;i11g of this brilliancy into something like the feeble and ineffectual radiance so noticeable occasionally in the winter days of New England. After this the daylight took on a more lurid charncter; the landscape appeared dull and cheerless; yet I could not perceive any change in the tints of the objects near at hand. The sky was very beautiful. At lh. 30m. I wa8 very much struck: with the intense blue of the sky immediately overhead, and also in the intervals of the clouds in the vicinity of the sun. The clouds themselves being fleecy and thi~1, presented a vast variety of fantastic forms of the intensest and purest white; !\,nd these, 1)y their strong contraRt, 1wought out the deep tint of the sky more strikingly. At the hour just named the clouds covered about nine-tenths of the Leavens. .At 2/i., just before the total immersion, I once more noticed the tint of the uncovered sky, and found it;;. darkness greatly increased. It was still purely blue, but with a depth of azure almost equal to that of the ocean. Appearances during total obscuralion.-The hst direct ray of the sun having been cut off while that body was too deeply enshrouded in cloud" to be visible, I withdrew my eye from the telescope with a feeling of deep disappointment, and gave my attention to surrounding things. The darkness was not such as to incommode me in performing any ordinary work. I looked up the bay, towards the north, and could have distinguished perl'lons or boats at a great dis· tance. .After look:iug all about me, I took up my note-book and wrote these lines: "During the total obscuration the horizon presented the appearance of twilight; in the north, especially, it was red. ''Countenances were not ghastly. "Could read and write with pencil with facility." Presently after, perceiving that Mr. Henry ·was availing himself of the assistance of a lamp to observe the chronometer, I took up my book again and read rny pencil notes, in order tlrnt I might be quite sure of the correctness of my statement. I found no difficulty whatever in reading them in any position. The redness of the horizon was remarkable in the north, chiefly. perhaps, because the north was the only point of the compass which furnished a horizon down to the sea. Looking in that direction, the appearance presented was very like what we observe here uightly at about 11 o'clock. It is, however, to be remarked that the obscuration of the greater part of the heavens, and particularly of the region of the sun, by clouds, contributed to the remarkable resemblauce between this light and twilight. In the northern horizon there happened to be a few clouds. But while the aspect of the lower heavens had so strong a sim'Jarity to the ordinary appearances of twilight, it cannot be said that the general a8pect of nature, or the kind of illumination that prevailed, was devoid of a certain singularity which it is difficult to describe, and which I have never witnessed under other circumstances. It was on this account that, remem· bering the statements which have been made of the funereal gloom and death-like pallor observed in similar moments before, I looked rnrefully into the faces of those who were nearest to me, in order to detect, if possible, any such traces there. The result of this observation I recorded at the time in the brief note above quoted. I perceived no such change in any of the countenances ab: ut me. Appearance cf the moon's limb during the partial eclipse.-The outline of the moon, as projected on the sun, was by no means reguiar. The most remarkable irregularities were observed on the (apparent.) upper portion of the oufline. As the crescent grew narrower these irregularities became more noticeable, in contrast, with the clear, well-defined outline of tbe sun's adjacent border-. Breaking up of tlie crescent before tqtal obscuration.-Whcn the bright crescent of the sun

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

remaining·uneclipscd bad been reduced to an exceedingly narrow line of light, it broke up into several portions. The phenomenon ·was so quickly over that I had not time to count them. These were more towards the upper cusp (the actual south cusp) than towards the other extremity. I saw no long black lines seeming to divide or cross the crescent, while the breadth still remained sufficient to mark them as lines. Had I never heard or read any discussion of this phenomenon I should have inferred that the breaking up was owing simply to the irregularities of the moon's limb, which already had been so distinctly seen, rendered more striking iu the impression produced by them by the effect of irradiation dilating the still unobscmred portions of the sun's edge up to the latest moment. Fincil contact.-The final contact of the two limbs was observed by me at 3h. 17m. 2s. time of the standard (Bond) chronometer. I watched, after the contact, for any remaining trace of the moon's margin, but could observe none. I at no time saw auy of the lunar spots, or any appearance indicative of the presence of the body, except its effect. in cutting off the light of the sun. Owing to the interposition of clouds during the entire period of total obscuration, the matters on which I had been most especially charged to observe and report--viz: the appearance of the corona; its dimensions; the red or violet clouds usually seen in it; their positfons, forms, growth, or diminution; and other analogous matters-were altogether unobservable. Respectfully, &c., F. A. P. BARNARD.

Wind from NW., blowing in gusts; large masses of clouds passing from the NW., with clear openings. My telescope was by Bolland, of 42 inches focus, with an aperture of 3~ inches; the power was about 40, and the color of the shade was light orange. It was mounted upon a tripod, having a rack and pinion motion, and was so placed that by only moving it in right angles I could keep the object in the centre of the field. I was comfortably seated, and was intently looking at the point of contact, when, at lh. Om. 56s., * the dark edge of the moon was seen upon the sun's surface. I must confess that, nothwithstanding that I had promised t-0 keep myself quite calm and collected, I was so starUed by the phenomenon that I am doubtful of the time to two seconds. There did not appear to be any disturbance of the sun's limb before contact, and the moon's limb also approached the spots in the sun without any attraction or Npulsion. The time of passing 8everal was noted with accuracy. About eight minutes before the total eclipse I removed the colored screen from the eyepiece, and as there was a light thin cloud over the sun, I could look steadily on the bright part without protection to the eye. At this time I looked around upon several objects that were before brightly illuminated by the sun; but now a great change had taken place. A gloomy, unearthly light fell upon all objects, impressing me with the idea that some fearful calamity was about to happen; and I can well imagine that armies eugaged in deadly strife would lay down their arms when nature cast so gha.st.ly a light upon the batUe field. When the bright crescent was reduced to a thin line of light, it was a beantiful object to behold, extending about 130 degrees around the edge of the moon. Shortly afterwards it broke

np into fragments, which appeared to swim from the centre towards the cusps. At 2h. 5m. 328. the last speck of light vanished, and a bright halo surrounded the part of the moon that I was looking at, and at about 20 degrees in the second quadrant I saw a white flame shooting up to a considerable distance. A dense cloud now passed over the sky and sun, and prevented any further observations being made until the emersion, the time of which was noted at 2h. Sm. 39s. At the time of the total eclipse, the wind, which had been blowing in gusts, now fell, and a death-like stillness prevail.:id. A little solitary bird poured forth a melancholy song, and then the stillness appeared even greater than before. Between the clouds I saw Capella shining brightly with her natural light. The darkness was not so great as I imagined it would be; I could see the remarks in my note-book without much difficulty. The light is totally different from that of morning or evening. The cusps were well defined, both during the immersion and emersion, except at 2h. 25m. 54s., when the lower cusp appeared to be broken off, instead of coming to a point. I could follow the edge of the moon off the sun three or four degrees. The faculre on the sun's surface, around the edge of the moon, at the last part of the emersion, were very distinctly seen, (Figure 7, sketch No. 39.) Two high mountains in the moon were seen at the immersion, just under the upper cusp. I have spoken of the phenomena as seen through an inverting telescope, and a vertical and horizontal line supposed to be drawn on the snrface of the sun.

Report of Prof. A. W. Smith---0:lipse

cf July

18, 1860.

ECLIPSE STATION, .Aul.ezavik island, July 20, 1860. 81&: I herewith submit a report of the observations made by myself during the solar eclipse of the 18th instant at our station on the coast of Labrador. The telescope used by me belongs to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., and was loaned to·Prof. Bache for the purposes of the expedition. From this circumstance, I suppose, it was assigned to myself on this occasion. It wae made by Piossl, of Vienna; has an object glass of about three inches aperture and thirty-eight inches focal distance. There were eight eye-pieces, one with a position micromet.er, which, however, was out of order. After trying the different powers upon the sun the day before, I decided to use the lowest, in order to bring the whole disc of the eun into the field at once. The telescope is equatorially mounted, and was roughly adjusted, so as to keep the sun in the field during tho eclipse while clamped in declination. I found, howeve1·, while observing the eclipse, a perceptible want of achro1na.tism on the borders of the field, and the tangent screw being too fine t-0 enable me

o Probably Ga , instead of 561.

254

HEPORT OF THE SUPElUNTENDENT OF

to bring all parts of the suu' s disc into the centre of the field with the needful despatch, I unclamped the declination circle. The screen used at every recorded observation gave a white image of the sun. At your suggestion, I used an angular eye-piece, which I found generally much more convenient, as the instrument was placed quite low; but the use of this eye-piece made it much more difficult to recover the sun, when, during concealment by a cloud, it pai:<sed out of the field, or was thrown out by accident, which was the case in one or two instances. 1. The first contact of the moon with the sun was observed at lh. Om. 14.5s., but the· indentation, when first detected, was so large as to jndieate that actual contact. occurred some seconds earlier. I could not discover the moon before contact, though I .scrutinized intently for it. 2. A bright but narrow band of deep yellow was seen soon after the moon's limb entered upon the sun's disc, and was visible, or was seen, till the moon approach·ed the large dark spot on the sun. It" may have continued longer visible, but my attention was not subsequently directed to it. This was not the effect of chromatic aberration, as the whole band was made to pass near the centre of the field, and was separated from the white light of the sun by a distinctly seen dark line. 3. Contact of moon's limb with the penumbra of the large spot, about lh. 12m. 35s., but vision was indistinct on account of a cloud. 4. At lh. 52m. noticed the lm,.,·er cusp slightly distorted or curved inwards towards the moon. 5. At lh. 53m. 33s. contact with sm:i.11 spot in the (apparent) SW. quadrant, (actual SE.) .At lh. 53m. 47s. spot totally obscured; at Ili. 5Brn. 57s. contact ·with a second small spot; at lh. 54m. 4s. contact with lower one of the group. 6. At ih. 57m. the concavity of the lower portion of the crescent appeared irregular. It was indented in two places, and at lli. 58m. another indentation was discovered still further up, the latter being about twice as far from the extremity of the cusp as the second of the preceding ones. At this time a bird was heard to sing. 7. At 2h. lm. a narrow red line or band was seen skirting the moon's border and apparently on the moon's surface. At 2h. 4m., (I find an entry was made on my note-book, under this date, simply of '' blee flasheR, '' but I am unable to recall or locate them.) 8. At 2h. 4in. 4ls. dark lines 1tppeared, dividing the upper portion of the fine silvery line of the sun's disc, giving to it a fragmentary appearance; the lower portion was indistinct, being partially concealed by a cbud. 9. The last recognition of any portion of the sun's disc was at 2h. 5m. 27s. Whether the disappearance was that of total obscuration or was occaRioned by the increased density of the intervening cloud I could not decide. IO. The ernersion was not seen, either because of the cloud or because the jmage was thrown out of the field, and, using an angular eye-piece, I was not able to recover it in time. 11. The large spot was not seen till 2h. 2lm. 51s. At 2h. 25m. 55s. the upper cusp appeared cut off or rounded. 12. At 2h. 28m. 168. the moon presented, more distinctly than at any other time before, the appearance of a hemisphere and the definition of all portions of the phenomenon more perfect, as if seen through the most perfectly transparent atmosphere. At this time a blue band of considerable breadth surrounded that portion of the moon which covered the sun. This band appeared to be made of radiations of blue light of different degrees of intensity in a direction perpendicular to the sun's surface. It was bounded by a well-defined line on the moon's surface. I was instantly reminded of the "mirage," so frequently witnessed on our voyage to this plaee, in which the horizon appeared to be skirted by a blue sea-wall. The resemblauce to an unbroken sheet of water (varying in thickness or irregular in surface, so as-to vary the

shading) falling over a mill-dam also occurred to me. At the base, where it was 10 contact with the sun, was a very narrow band or line of yellow light, as noted in No. 2. 13. .At 2h. 32m. the upper cusp appeared bifurcated, one of the divisions being prolonged beyond the other. 14. .At 2h. 35m. 43s. a bluish light was seen to flash around the lower limb of the moon from tlie sun's disc, having a curvature the same as that of the moon, seeming, for the moment, to reveal the border of the ml)on beyond the sun's disc. 15 . .At 2h. 55m. :flashes of yellow light appeared to stream up from the moon on to the sun; subsequently they were perceived to be faculre on the sun's disc. 16. At 3h. Im. another spot appeared. 17. The last appearance of the moon's limb was at 3h. 17m. ls. It was probably concealed from view by a cloud, and passing out of the field I was not, from the character of the ini;trument and the circumstance that it was not in accurate adjustment, able to recover it before the end. Of the phenomena specified in the list, to which my attention was specifically called by you, I have referred in the foregoing, with one exception, to those only which were actually seen. During the entire period of the eclipse I did not, more than once or twice, turn my eyes in the actual direction of the sun, being anxious that nothing which the telescope might reveal should escape me, and therefore can report nothing of the general appearances to unassisted vision. I regret that I have not the means at hand of illustrating by diagrams some of the foregoing observations, especially those attended by color. Respectfully submitted. Your obedient servant,

Report if Pref. O. S. Venable on the totril eclipse ef July 18, 1860.
At Ih. Om. 15s. saw the first contact, the moon's rough edge just on the edge of the sun. At 7m. 9s. observed some distortion of the upper cusp. The observations were made with a screen of green glass. At this time, and several times during the observations, I thought the portion of the sun around the moon's edge brighter than the rest, but could not, with my telescope, distinguish it as a bright band around the moon's edge. At l31n. 27s. saw the large spot (marked in the diagram) submerged without any peculiar appearance. I now devoted a short interval to the observation of the polarization of the atmosphere, the results of which I have stated below. At 4lm. noticed the rapid darkening of the labdscape, and the beautiful tints of the cloud shadows on the mountains on the opposite side of the bay. At 51m. again observed a distortion of the upper cusp. The lower of the two spots of second magnitude marked on the diagram began to be submerged at 53m. 19s. and the upper one at 53ni. 578., without any accompanying and peculiar phenomenon. At 54:m. 24s. the upper one entirely covered. At 56m. 5s. noticed the edge of the moon rougher a.t the upper cusp. At 59m. the blue-green tints of the cloud shadows and of the mountains very beautiful. At -m. 58s. the distortion of the upper cusp much greater, and at 59m. 17s. observed the foI"mation of a bead at the upper cusp; saw two or three form. The clouds now interfered to such an e:x.t.ent· that it was only at intervals that I could catch glimpses of the decreasing

crescent, and I made no observation of the peculiar phenomena which could be relied on. Just before the total eclipse I looked up from the telescope in despair at the sky, and saw the last drop of the crescent flashing and twinkling like a bright and beautiful star through an opening in the clouds, then suddenly extinguished at 211. 5m. 29s. At 7m. 58s. could read the advertisement print of an ordinary newspaper at four inches distance, or, to speak more accurately, I was compelled to bring my eyes much closer to the paper to read it than on ordinary occasions. Observed the reappearance of the large spot at 2h. 21m. 53s. Saw a bluntness of the upper cusp at 25m. 50s. About this time observed, with green glasses, the two long bright lines across the sun's disc, which appeared to come from the moon's border. They were very bright faculre. I observed the time of last contact to be 3h. 17 m. ls. I did not fix the position (by the lines) of the first contact, but by recollection I mako it a little more than 45° from the vertex. I estimated the position of the last contact at about 48°, or 50° from the opposite vertex. With regard to what was specially assigned to me in your programme, viz: the corona and roseate clouds, I have to state that the clouds prevented all observation of them. The positions of the spots before the eclipse were determined both by Prof. Barnard and myself. At frequent intervals during the eclipse I made observations on the polarization of the atmosphere with Savart' s polariscope. At lh. 19m. hardly any perceptible polarization within 30° of the sun. Maximum was near the horizon, between N. and NE. ; also very strong in SW. At Ih. 34m. no material change; stronger, perhaps, in NW., commencing above the horizon, at about 35 or 40 degrees from the sun. At 56m. max., in east. At 2h. 14s. noticed a diminution of polarization in SW. In NW. strong, and in N. and NE. same as at first observation. At 2h. 3lm. polarization max. in NW. and NE. I do not think that any con· clusion can be drawn from these observations as to any effect of the eclipse on the polarization of the atmosphere, though no observations were made in this respect during the total eclipse, as I was anxiously looking each instant for the clouds to pass over so that I could observe the corona and the accompanying phenomena. On tl1e afternoon of the 18th, in connection with Dr. Barnard and Mr. Lieber, I made the simultaneous barometric observations for the determination of the height of our station above the sea level, as well as of two of the peaks of the mountain chain at whose base we were anchored. From these observations I ascertained the height of the station to be 110 feet, and of the peaks to be, respectively, 1, 729 and 2, 150 feet above the level of the sea. For the highest of these peaks, which is on the northern point of Aulezavik island, overlooking the sea and the harbor (Sketch 38) in which the vessel was anchored, I have the honor, in connection with Com. Murray and Mr. Lieber, to propose the name of Mount Bache.

''_Earth temperature8, (Aulezavik.)
"In boring the earth for the burial of the bottles of water according to instructions, I could not get the depths therein required. At a depth of three or four feet I either met with rocks which required t.he pickaxe, or a soft caving mud. I buried three bottles, which gave the following temperatures: ''Depth two feet, (wet,) temperature 40°. :: Depth two and a half feet, {wet,) temperature 40°. Depth three feet, (dryer,) temperature 43°.9.

''These holes were bored around the meteorological station, 110 feet above the sea level. ''I tested the temperature of nine springs which had their source doubtless in the winter's snows. There was very little snow to be seen on the mountain side from which they sprung. They had different elevations, varying from 500 to 100 feet above the sea level. The following temperatures were obtained: 39°, 35°, 35~ , 37°, 39°, 40°, 41°, 37i 0 · One pond gave 46°, and two small streams at a short distance from their sources gave 45° each."

''.Atmospheric elecfric:i"ty. "For these observations, through tho kindness and skill of Mr. French, chief engineer of the Bibb, an instrument was made by which I was enabled to elevate the ball to a height of twenty-two feet above the earth's surface. This was done by moans of a pole running in a long groove, and elevated by a small pulley. I made repeated trials with the apparatus, using both the small reel with the covered wire, and subsequently the lever insulator, with wire and handle, but obtained no indications of electric action. The weather was not at any time very favorable, due to the winds and moisture. The experiments were made repeatedly on different dayf1 by myself alone, and then with Prof. Barnard, and subsequently by Mr. W. A. Henry, when the electrometers exhibited a very considerable degree of sensitiveness, and still there were no perceptible indications of electricity on application of the ball." '' Irebergs, snow, &c. "On July 6, in the morning, saw first small iceberg, and small masses of broken ice floating about. Saw first snow on the mountains of Labrador. This was in the straits of Belle Isle. From this point to Aulezavik icebergs were coni;tantly in view, and snow in patches along the whole line of coast mountains, in many places down to the water's edge. I record below several notes made on different days. "July 7, 8.30 p. m., thirty-four icebergs in sight, varying from thirty to two or three hundred feet in height, and from fifty to two or three hundred feet in length. "July ,12, 7A p. m., ten icebergs in view; very large. The estimates of their magnitude very various. Off Port Manvers the most massive one was i;;een, six or seven hundred feet Ion~, and one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet high. Much higher estimates than this were made by m~ny. I had one or two opportunities of experimenting on theE>e large icebergs with the minimum radiation thermometers. They produced no effect at a distance of several hundred yards. From the top of Mount Bache, at the head of Aulezavik harbor, Mr. Lieber and I saw thirty-six icebergs to the south and east of the mountain, and to the northeast a field of ice many miles in extent. I observed the same field the day afterwards from one of the mountains on the main land on the opposite side of the harbor. The advance guard of this ice field consisting of hundreds of comparatively small lumps projecting fifteen or twenty feet above the surface of the ocean. On the return voyage there were still a great many ice· bergs visible. Many, however, had disappeared, broken to pieces most probably by the gale of the 22d and 23d of July. There was much more floating ice than on the upwa1d voyage. There were several slight showers of snow and hail at Aulezavik, as reported in the journal, besides the storm of the 22d. Some few flakee fell on the mountain top on the evening of the 18th, and in the gale of the 22d and 23d the mountains were covered down to the water's edge. We had no opportunity of testing its depth, as we were very effectually confined on shipboard. This newly fallen snow was visible between two and three hundred miles south of .A.ulezavik, on the sides of the coast mountains. "On an island off the coast near the harbor of Nain, Mr. Lieber found a specimen of red snow, which was examined b~ Prof. Barnard with the microscope. The red spores of the fungus were very prettily exhibited. .Another specimen of this snow was found by Prof. Barnard on the mainland north of Aulezavik harbor.

'' Mirage and other phenomena.
''There were many instances of mirage during the voyage. Inversions of vessels in tlie offing changing contour and elevation of coast Jines. In my notes I have remarked one or two of tliese days. "July 1, off Halifax; vessel inverted in the horizon. "July 7; a day of grand mirage. Coast lines varying fantastically each moment. Icebergs lifted in the clouds and inverted. In one case an iceberg seen on three levels. Cannot speak positively of any evidence of lateral refraction. "July 8; continuation of same. Tops of icebergs lengthened and pointed. One image of iceberg seen for nearly half an hour suspended in stratum of clouds which skirted the horizon, the base being far above the horizon.

''Rainbow.
''On the top of the peak above thl' meteorological camp were seen by Mr. Lieber and myself three rainbows, as represented in Figure 8, (of Sketch No. 39.) First, the ordinary bow; then one concentric with this, and having the colors of the spectrum arranged similarly with the first. The mountain side prevented a second contact or cutting of these two bows. Concentric with tbe first came the ordinary secondary bow, with the colors in inverted order. All of these were very bright, the second one not so bright as the other two.

"Auroras.
·'Saturday, June 30: aurora, first appearance 8.45 p. m., and continued several hours; base of ar;h extended from Gemini, in west, about 120°, having vertex nearly under Polaris. At 11 p. m. sent streamers up to zenith over Arcturus on one side, and a Aquilre on the other. The arch was of pale sulphur color, the streamers varying to bright red. "Sunday, July 1: auroral arch of nearly the same dimen!'lions-not so distinctly defined sent rays nearly to zenith. Arch of pale sulphur color. Rays varying at times to bright red. "Monday, July 2: aurora observed at 8 p. m.; continued with various changes to 12 p. m. or later. Arch of nearly the same positions and dimensions as the preceding, but not entirely filled out nor so distinctly defined. Rays on both sides of centre, and immediately through the ceutre of arch to zenith. Rays varying in color from pale sulphur color to bright red . . "WedneE'day, July 4: aurora observed at 9! p. m. Vertex of arch 70° from horizon-formed in south. Beams having a dome-like structure. A.rch dense, and of sulphur color. Partia[ corona formed two or three times; most imposing at 11 o'clock. Red rays very beautifully intermingled with the pale yellow at different times, and giving, as in the other auroras, more distinct polarization. Most beautiful beams in the northeast. "July 8: aurora observed at 11 o'clock. Streamed up from NW., between Arcturus and tail of Ursa Major, flowing up, as it seemed, in the constant continuous vibrations of bright waving changing colors, varying from pale straw color through deep sulphur and bright red. These irregular beams streamed up beyond zenith, circled around a Lyrro down so far as a Aquilre, including in its feathery, flowing curtain-like folds Ursre Minor, sometimes Cassiopeia, Cygnus, and Draco; these folds changing form and position most fitfully. At times a perfect spiral, then irregular waves. There was now and then columnar structure, and once au arch extending from NW·. point under Arcturus to corresponding NE. point of horizon (SE. of const., Cassiopeia.) · "July 11: observed at 11.30 p. m. A. corona formed at a quarter to twelve on the wing of Cygnus, south, beams radiating to all points of compass; oorona disappeared and reappeared several times; sometimes an imperfect one, like an open fan in appearance.

yellow, and red-colored cloud beams in south at various points. Observed the phenomena until half past twelve. Once appeared in the form of two bright wing,;, extending from the corona point in Cygnus, nearly along the meridian, anrl almost to the horizon on either side, t<jpering graduall,y from zenith to horizon. The color of these alrnosl white-strongly con· trasted by dark portions in various points of the he,1vens. The reddish clouds showed i>tronger polarization than the pale. The dark portions gave the strongeRt. polarization. "July 12: a slight brush observed in south at 10~ p. m. A low arch formed at 11.15vertex under Capella. Arch very pale, and indistinctly defined. "July 16: distinct flasliing of auroral beams in NE. at 8 p. m. Sun behind mountain on opposite side of bay, ( Aulezavik.) These beams vibrated and flashed up nearly to the zenith. Sky very much overcast afterwards during the night. "July 17: slight exhibition of auroral beams at 11 p. m. "July 25: aurora reported at 12 o'clock. Arch formed in southern sky. "July 29: aurora at half-past nine first observed. Corona half formed once or t\·:ice, giving another exhibition of the fan-like structure, and once the waving, irregular, and curtain-like form, at times as!'uming the appearance of the two great wings, neaTly from zenith to horizon, across the meridian. ''August 1 : aurora reported. Corona formed at 2 o'clock a. m. ; arch-base extending from point of horizon SW. of Arcturus to point little SE. of Casi>iopeia. Bright beams in the southern l'ky. ''August 2: aurora. A slight brush of auroral cloud at 8~ p. m. "August 6: aurora visible from 9 o' cluck p. m. until 3~ or 4 a. m. of 7th. Arch formed earlyabout 80° base in northern sky-vertex under Polari:o 20° from horizon. Bright sulphurcolored beams varying in position visible all night, arch changed to irregular waving curtain line. At times beautifully red, especially towards zenith. At midnight, and after, very bright. At 2.20 a. m. observed the effects on prepared sulph. quin. paper-exhibited a decided phosphorescent glow."

ef the plwtographers.

Srn: In compliance with your request., that some account of the method pursued in taking photographic impressions of the sun during tho eclipse of July 18, 1860, might be given, I lierewith append a short sketch of the instruments used, and tho method of proceeding. Tho telescope used on the occasion >vas of five feet focal length, mounted equntorially, and owned by L. M. Rutherford, esq., of New York, by whom it was kindly furnished to the expedition. At the eye-piece end of the telescope was firmly fixed a small camera obscura box of a size sufficient to contain a plate five and a half inches square. The camera was furnished with a side slide bearing a piece of white paper, upon which the sun's image was thrown by the ''finder'' attached to the telescope. The eye-piece was peculiarly fitted in order to give the very short exposure which the sun requires to impress its image upon the sensitive plate. Covering the Jens was a flat brass plate, having an opening in the centre three-eights of an inch in diameter, and moved by a small spring. Upon the circumference of the plate are two smaller boles, in which a lever upon the side of the tube catches, and counteractR the action of the spring. A piece of string leading through the camera box from the outside is attached to the lever. The method of proceeding is as follows: The plate is pushed back against the spring, and the lever set iu the first of the small holes in the circumference. This holds the plate, so that the hole in the centre is just over the eye-piece; the suu' s image is thus allowed to be focused upon the ground glass plate in the camera beneath. 'Ihe plate is then puslied back to hole 2, and the lever inserted, thus cutting off all transmis:sion of light through the orifice at the eye-piece. The sensitive plate is then introduced in the ordinary way. The sun's image, as shown by the "fiuder" upon the white paper disc, is brought by the "universal joints" to coincide with a mark made for the purpose of indicating the central position of the sun's image on the photographic plate. The string attached to the lever is then pulled; the lever is thus pushed out of the little hole, by which it holds the plate back, and the spring thus coming in play flashes across the eye-piece, and the impression is taken. The exposure is simply the time occupied by the opening in the brass plate in passing the orifice at the eye-piece, and has been estimated to be about the one-fiftieth of a second. The object glass of the telescope was adjusted for the difference between the visual and the photographic focus. As a matter of experience connected with the successful working of the photographic preparations used in the pictures already secured it might be well to give their composition. Thev are as follows: O~llo.iion.-Sulph. ether (sp. gr. 0. 72) 4 fluid drachma; alcohol (95 per ct.) 4 fluid drachms; iodide of potassium 2.5 grains; iodide of cadmium 2.5 grains; pyroxiline prepared for cadmium collodion, 5 grains. Silver bath. --40 grains to the ounce, neutral i the nitrate of silver having been crystallized three times. Developer.-Tlie ordinary sulphate of protoxide of iron solution. By these preparations the exposure of one-fiftieth of a second with a magnifying eye-piece, and a diaphragm of two inches on the telescope could have been reduced to a. shorter time,

inasmuch as the latent image was developed instantaneously anu with great intensity, requiring no reinforcing, and thus being a great saving of time. Plater; Nm;. 6, 7, 8, 9 show a peculi:u phenomPnon, consisting of a bright and well marked Jig ht upon the moon's limb, gradually diffm;ed towards t11c edges after the manner of a halo. This is a strong evidence of the sensitiveness of the photogrnphic preparations, leaving no doubt that had the corona been visible a photographic impreRsion of it could have been taken in the same time of exposure, but with the full aperture of the telescope, and without the magnifying eye-piece. Owing to the unfortunate disadvantages of the weather but twelve pictures of the edipse were obtained, together with three of the full sun after the phenomenon had passed. But experience proved that had the weather been fair two pictures in five minutes could have been obtained; thus securing a very complete collection of impressions showing every phase of the phenomenon. During the total obscuration the most beautiful bluish tints were observed, certainly capable of strong photographic effects. It is to be regretted that a view of the landscape, with the Rplendidly tinted clouds, showing a strong contrast, could not have been taken. As incidental information, I would remark* that during total obscuration the stars and planets Castor, Pollux, Capella, Jupiter, and Ven us were observed. P. C. DUCHOCHOIS. A. W. THOMPSON. NOTES BY MR. THOMPSON.-During the total obscuration a star of the first magnitude was noticed near or about the meridian, some 12 or 15 degrees south of the zenith, (Capella?) and was noticed to shine with a bright white Ught. The accompanying fragment of newspaper was easily read at six inches from the eye about the moment of greatest obscuration. This focal distance is about half the ordinary distance of such sized print in broad daylight. The bronze tints of clouds toward the sun, the deep yellow twilight toward the north, and the sudden gust of wind during the total eclipse were also noticed; as also the astronomical phenomenon approaching in appearance to ''Baily's Beads.''

I observed that whenever the sun emerged from the clouds thoEe gut>ts of wind generally sprang up; wind blowing from the direction in which the sun appeared to move in, and gradually increasing in force until the sun became totally eclipsed, when it lulled down for a while; force then about one to two knots. Wind increased again as the eclipse was 'passing off; direction of the wind unchanged during the coming on and passing off of the eclipse.

SIDNEY,

Cape Breton, August 3, 1860.

Sm: I have respectfully to submit the following report with regard to the determination of the magnetic elements near Cape Chudleigh, Labrador, in connection with the expedition to observe the total eclipse of the sun. The station selected by the astronomers of the expedition was upon the northern end of Aulezavik island, in north latitude 59° 48', Jongitude 4h. 17 m. west of Greenwich. The steamer came to anchor near this station on Saturday, July 14. As soon as a landing could be effected I went ashore with the dip circle, and made a preliminary series of observations at five different stations to a.scertain the most suitable locality for magnetic observa· tions. The position decided upon was as near the station of least dip as the nature of the ground would admit. The next day, (Sunday,) the weather being fine and the necessity urgent, I had the tents and instruments sent ashore, and by night., with the assistance of Mr. Walker, had made partial adjustments of the declinometer and bifilar, in readiness for final adjustment the next day. These were not made without great difficulty, owing to the extraordinary changes of declination and horizontal force, due, to some extent, perhaps, to the presence of an aurora, which, on Monday evening, was observed by Prof. Venable shooting up in the northern sky nearly an hour before sunset. The adjustment of the bifilar magnetometer was left entirely to Yr. Walker. By Monday night both instruments were in adjustment; two sets of vibrations had been observed with the declinometer, and one set of observations made for magnetic dip. Early on Tuesday morning two more sets of observations were made; half-hourly readings of the bifilar were begun, and at 8 a. m. was commenced the series of half-hourly readings of the declinometer and bifilar for the twenty-four hours before and after the eclipse. Very great changes of declination and horizontal force were observed throughout Tuesday; the vibration of the declinometer magnet, embracing an arc of five and a half degree~. There is no reason to suspect local attraction; no indications of the presence of magnetic oxide of iron were perceived.

THE UNITED STA.TES COAST SURVEY.

269

The observations of both instruments, on the day of the eclipse, were made in accordance with your instructions, and the continuous series of half-hourly readings were kept up till Thursday at 2 p. m. On Wednesday (18th July) and the day following, the changes of declination amounted to as much as two and a half and two and three-quarter degrees. On Wednesday the effect of the total darkness was apparently to diminish and, for a moment or two, almost to snspend the vibrations of the magnet, which seemed as if it were waiting the reappearance of the sun. The remaining observations necessary to complete the series were obtained <luring Thursday and Friday, the greater part of Friday being occn pied by Mr. W alke1· in observations of deflection and vibration, the latter being so arranged as to eliminate as much as possible the errors arising from the frequent and irregular changes of declination. Observations were made upon the sun for azimuths. On Friday evening the instruments were packed and sent aboard the steamer in anticipation of her departure the next day. · Duplicate records of the observations are now in preparation, and will be forwarded to you as soon as possible after the arrival of the vessel at New York. Before the work can be computed, it may be desirable to determine the zero of the scale and moment of inertia of the declination magnet, unless recent determinations can be made available. The great chai1ges of declination at the Labrador station made it impos.,,ible to get accurate results for these constants. The approximate declination may be stated as 51;i degrees west of northj the dip 82t degrees. Mr. Samuel Walker took part in all the obsenmtions. To his skill and experience I am greatly indebted for whatever success has attended our joint labors. Very respectfully, yours,

EDWARD GOODFELLOW.

Remarks by Assistant O. A. Schort on the magnetic constants found for A.ulezavik, LalJrador.
CO.A.ST SURVEY OFFICE, Washington, n. c., October 1, 1860. Srn: The magnetic results of the Labrador expedition, made out by Assistant Edward Goodfellow, and sent to me in your letter of September 25, have been examined. The declination, 51j 0 W., compares very well with Hansteen's value (47~" W.) for about

DE.AR

the year 1820, (as lately published in his "Forandring, &c.") The value assigned by Evans' map for 1858, viz: 55° W., I think is too high, in consequence of too large a correction 1iaving been used for secular change. On Sabine's map for 1840 the declination given is 52° W. The diurnal variation is really very large at Kane's Winter Quarters, and with a dip of 84 ~ 0 it was but little over 1°; hence with a dip of only 82! 0 we might expect to find still less. The dip 82l 0 compares well with Gauss' computed value, (83°,) and the intensity seems to agree with Sabine's deductions. At Cape Chudleigh the total intensity (12. 52) is somewhat less than it is at Washington (13.5) or at New York, (13.3.) Yours, very respectfully, CHAS. A. SCHOTT, .Assistant Cowt Survey. Prof. A. D. BACHE,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF .ADDENDUM.

Longitude by chronometers.
The results of the comparison of the other chronometers with that selected as the standard, show, in the case of most of them, quite small deviations on both sides from a uniform daily rate with reference to the standard. This is most readily to be accounted for in so many instances by the hypothesis that all the instruments in question preserved a nearly iiniform sea-rate during the outward and also during the return voyage. The error from Greenwich mean time, at the epoch of the eclipse, has accordingly been computed on this hypothesis for all ~he chronometers whose regularity (as thus manifested and otherwise exhibited) was such as seemed to render them available; the hypothesis, viz: of a uniform sea-rate from the day of sailing to the date of the second comparison of the instruments with the standard of the Messrs. Blunt, which. comparison was, as near as might be, immediately on the steamer's return. For the single day which intervened between the first comparison with the Messrs. Blunt' s standard and the time of our departure, the shore-rate, already ascertained, has -been allowed in the instances of Bond &: Sons 177, Dent 2602, Fletcher 1739, and Dent 2126, respectively. In the instances of Arno7d & Dent 802, and Kessel 1285, respectively, for which no comparisons in New York had been effected, the errors from Green!bich m,ean time for the :first date of comparison of chronometers on shipboard, (June 29,) and also for the last date (August 7) have, respectively, been computed by first dedU£:ing the error for each of the two chronometers by a separate comparison with every one of the other four, (allowance being of course mad8'> for their errors and rates,) and then taking the mean of the results in the instance of each. ·The time is thus made to be dependent on the mean of the rates of the four other chronometers from June 27 to June 29 in the one determination, and from August 7 to August 10 in the other. As but one of the four rates in question exceeded 2s.5, and none of them had been much altered, and all were in the main well accordant, these deduced means of errors from Greenwich mean time, including accumulations through such short intervals, must be regarded as being in no small degree reliable. Between the dates of June 29 and August 7 each of the two chronometers (Arnold &; Dent, 802, and Kesscl's 1285) has been presumed to have maintained (like the others also) its mean sea-rate, and the error from Greenwich mean time, at the epoch of the eclipse, been computed for each, independently of any other chronometer. Then the error from the local mean time was, in every case, obtained by comparison with the standard, (Dent, 2602,) and thus, with Bond & &ns 177, which was the chronometer made use of in our astronomical observations. The algebraical difference of the two errors of course gives the longitude. The details of the computation are sufficiently exhibited in what follows; the sign denoting too fast, as also a gain in rate, and the sign-, as the case may be, too sww, or a losing rate.

If we adopt the equation of time given_ in the British Nautical Almanac, instead of that in the American, the longitude will be diminished Os. 36. S. A.

APPENDIX No. 22.
An account qf the lotal sOlar eclipse qf July 18, 1860, as observed for the Unt'ted States Coast Survey near Steilacoom, Washington Territory, by lieut. J. M. Gi"lliss, U. S. Navy.
PRELIMINARY.

There seemed too little probability of favorable results from an expedition to observe the tote.I eclipse from the west side of the American continent t-0 justify the despatch either of many tl.ssis.tants or of an elaborate equipment of instruments. Experienced gentlemen, or thoa~ who we~ supposed t.o be so, and were consulted, pronounced that portion of Washington Territory which tho total shadow·path would traverse rugged, crossed by dangerous t-Orrenta,

caused by the snowi; melting at that season, and covered by dense forests, which would be likely to obstruct vision in almost every direction. They thought that a suitable site would be attainable only after cutting a path through immense forest trees to some mountain top of the Cai,cade range; and to accomp1i1'h this from Seattle, in the direction of the line of totality, involved a journey of five or six days on horses, and the fording of a stream (White river) which is perilous at all times, but is especially so at high water and with loaded animals. Nor were their prognostications ·more flattering for the atmo~pheric condition on the morning of the eclipse. The hour of the day was against us, a law of meteorology to which that regiim forms no exception, and therefore they could offer few expectations of bright auroral skies to serve as encouragement during the certain, harassing forest struggle. They could safely promise a large proportion of clear afternoons in July, probably quite two-thirds of the whole number; but at the hour at which the eclipse would take place there, they thought we should be lucky if the mists rmd fog- banks from the Cascades and Puget sound permitted vision of the sun one morning of five. Bt!sides these natural hindrances, as the country is a newly settled one, great doubt was expressed whether proper transportation could be obtained from the proposed starting points for the land journey. Fortunately it was possible to proYide against imch contingency; for when the remaining portion of the programme was complete, General Jesup, U. S. A., very considerately instructed the quartermaster at Fort Vancouver, on Columbia river, to supply as many pack mules as might be required for the service, and thus allayed all anxiety on a very important question. Having these several obstacles aud risks clearly in view, two aids attached to the U.S. Coast Survey were designated to assist me in the observations, and, in the expectation that we should occupy an eminence of the Cascade mountains between lakes Kachess and Kitchelus, (lat. 47° 23' N., long. 121° 28' \V.,) I regarded it indispensable to have as few instruments a~ would suffice for the work, and to have them distributed in light packages. The assistants appointed were Messrs. A. T. :Mosman and James Gilliss, both of whom were then on the West Coast of the United States. The former, who was supposed to be at Gray's harbor, was instructed to obtain, by personal examination and otherwise, all pot5sihle information of the country between the towns of Seattle and Steilacoom, Puget sound and White river, to ascertain whether men and animals could be had in that vicinity, and to report to me, on the arrival at Seattle of the steamer with the mail of May 21 frnm New York. Mr. Gilliss, then near San Francisco, was directed to meet me at that city, to have tents in readiness, and to make arrangements for a proper supply of provisions to last ten persons during sixteen days. The instruments required for the party were : lAt. A te]e;;cope for my own use, to be mounted eqnatorially. Through the courtesy of Commander M. F. Maury, U.S. N., the comet-seeker belonging to the Washington Observatory was obtained. It is of the largest size, made at Munich by Merz & Mahler, viz: 3/0 inches clear aperture, and 34.6 inches focal length, ·with hour and declination circ1es of five inches diameter, and mounted on a heavy stand of brass, adjustable on foot-screws. As it was constructed for the Washing ton Observatory, whose latitude is (about) 39° N., and I contemplated occupying a station near the parallel of 47° N., a wedge-shaped plate of brass was fitted under its polar axis, in order to give the latter the requisite elevation. Its eye-piece all:jo was t<pccially prepared at tlie Coa8t Survey office. Improving upon the device adopted in Peru, in 185tl, concentric circles, divided by diameters into octants, were engraved upon a plate of very thin glass, which was cemented at the focus of the lenses. The inner circle was (34'. 9) intended to be (as it was pretty nearly) of the diameter of the moon as seen in the field on the morning of the eclipse ; the next one of fi', and the third of 81 greater diameter, &c. The eye-piece ~agnified 32 times, and was furnished with a revolving disc, fitted with a series of differently hnted screen glasses.

2d. In accordance with a suggestion from Dr. B. A. Gould, a dark chamber, within which to observe the image of the sun when projecte<l upon a screen of white pa per, was fitted to Coast Survey reconnoitering telescope No. 10. The instrument i8 a 3-inch achromatic, of 46} inches focal length. mounted upon a common tripod of wood that permits vertical and horizontal motion«, but which is without clamps or Rlow-motion f'crew,;. [t,; ol1jcct glass appears to he an excellent one ; the magnifying power of its eye-piece 50. The dark chamber is a box of very thin pine hoards, whose dimensionR are 1-i x 10~ x 9t inches. Five sides of the interior are stained with lamp-black, the sixth covered with drawing paper. There is an aperture in tho side facing the lust, through which the eye end of the telescope passes tightly, and affords partial support to the box, the remaining weight being distributed between four brass rods, one end of each of which is soldered to a clamp fitted to the telescope tube, and the other ends penetrate corners of the box, where the~' are held by thumb-screws. One side of the box is hinged, to facilitate drawings. For observation of the magnified image upon the screen, there is au aperture sufficiently distant from the former to permit application of the eye without touching the telescope tube by the head. Thus tho observer stands with his back to the object, and colored screen glasses are wholly dispensed with. The instrument would have afforded more interesting detail::; but for its defective mounting, a result I am responsible for, because it \Vas my duty, at least, to have seen the stand before unpacking it in 'Vashington Territory. 3d. For the determination of the latitude of the station and its local time Coast Survey prismatic sextant No. 65, made by Pistor & Martins, and a mercurial artificial horizon were selected. The sextant is of ten inches radius, and reads by a vernier to 10". 4th. Three chronometers. One of them was Coast Survey box sidereal chronometer No. 311, which wa;.i removed from its gimbals and packed in double and padded leather cases, fitted \vith straps for suspending it over the shoulders, and a belt to bind it. to the waist. 'l'he others were mere mean time pocket chronometer;:, viz, No. 2113, with steel ands ha.nd stronglymarked second's dial, and Ko. Tf 9 . For the nse of the latter instruments I am under obliga· tion to Commander M. F ..Manry, U. S. N. Neither of the three can be regarded a first-rate one. 5th. Meteorological instruments. Through the courtesy of Prof. Joseph Henry, these were obtained from the Smithsonian Institution. They consisted of a cistern barometer No. 1356, reading to in . .002, and a syphon barometer No. - , similarly divided ; two air thermometers, Nos. A, 1637, and B, 1638, divided on ivory scales to l 0 ; two wet-bulb thermometers, with corresponding numbers, and lettered B, divided in the same manner on ivory, and two blackbulb radiating thermometers made in the same manner as the others. Each b~rometer was securely packed in an inner case of wood, and an outer one of leather fitted with [ransporting shoulder-straps. One thermometer of each kind was packed in a sm:ill box, and furnished wit.h brass spring bracket and thumb-screws, by which to attach it to any convenient object. These instruments were made by Mr. James Green, of New York. The remainder of the equipment comprised only a small lantern, a Nautical .-!.lmanac, and a table of logarithms. Except the chronometers and barometers, it was packed in three stronglymade boxes, provided with handles, to be used in case it became noccssar.'' to abandon their carriage on mules. When ready for transportation, they averaged rather le,,;s than one hundred pounds each. Leaving New York per steamer of May 21, I crosi!ed the isthmus of Panama on the evening of the 29th, and arrived at San Francisco on the afternoon of June 12. Mr. James Gilliss joined me at the fatter citv. As the steamers from Sau Francisco to Puget's sound do not touch at Seattle, and Mr. Mosman had been directed to await me at the latter place, application was matle to Messrs. Forbes & Babcock:, the agents of the Pacific Mail Steamship Comp my, to permit a departure

278

from the regular itinerary of the voyage. And not only did these gentlemen promptly concede this important service, but they also instructed Captain Hudson, commanding the Panama, to facilitate my objects in every other manner in his power-an order which he most liberally and cordially interpreted, and executed on that as well as during the return voyage to San Francisco. Two days later the instruments, tents, and provisions were ehippod on board the Panama, by which steamer we left San Francisco at noon of 15th June, navigated the Columbia and Willamette rivers as far as Portland, in Oregon, and arrived off Seattle at 9 p. m., of the 22d~ Mr. Mosman had not been there, and, as I afterwards learned, in consequence of there being no regular mail communication with Gray's harbor, his orders were not received until some days after my arrival in Washington Territory. On this account he was not able to join me until July 8. Residents of Oregon and of Washington Territory, who had been fellow passengers with us from San Francisco, stated that there had been unusually heavy falls of rain (snow on the Cascade mountains) during the last winter and spring, and, in consequence of a continuance of the cold weather to a very late period, the annual freshets in the rivers had been very much delayed. We had seen the islands in the Columbia and Willamette rivers overflowed, and were told that those streams were, at least, ten feet higher than their usual level at that season of the year. It was reasonable to expect that the rivers of Washington Territory, which are further north, would be proportionally higher. Of the latter, and of the difficulties of crossing them with pack animals, reliable information was gained from an officer of the Hudson's Bay Company, who had made many journeys through the Yakima country between Vancouver, on the Columbia river, and Nisqually, on Puget's sound. · For want of the knowledge which had been expected through Mr. Mosman, as soon as it was satisfactorily ascertained that the number of animals required for transportation could not be obtained at Seattle, I deemed it proper to proceed to Fort Steilacoom, thirty-five miles fuJther south, and consult with the United States officers there. Five hours later we landed at the village of the same name, which is located on the sound, a mile and a half to the west of the garrison. While lying off Seattle a brilliant comet was seen in the northwest. .A.t first I supposed it an auroral streamer, but its true character was instantly manifest when an ordinary ship spy· glass was turned upon it. This was the first clear evening experienced after passing Cape St. Lucas on the 8th June, and though there was still considerable twilight, and the moon was four days old, the comro could be traced through more than 10° by the unassisted eye. The nucleus was quite disti11ct in the telescope. It was estimated to be about lm. east, and 3° south of {1 A.urigm. It was seen on the evenings of the 23d and 24th also. On the latter evening its tail was near 15° in length, and the nucleus had evidently moved to the south and east. When a telescope was unpacked, on the evening of t,he 26th, the portion of the heavens occupied by it was obscured by clouds, nor was it subsequently seen. Brief conversation with the officers at Fort Steilacoom showed how little reliable was the topographical information previously obtained. They regarded the inference from the high water of the Columbia a just one as to the state of White river, but expressed every confidence that a journey to the summit of the Cascade mountains was totally uncalled for, if there was no other object in view than to obtain a horizon at sunrise, because they knew of many small open prairies west of the :range which would permit vision of the snu almost, if not actually, upon the horizon. They were right. T~o days afterwards an appropriate site for the observations was found about ten miles S.SE. from the garrison, and we encamped upon it on the morning of July 9 following, thus avoiding a hazardous, fatiguing, and costly journey to an inhospitable region, where a cloudy sky would most probably have attended us.

TopograpMcaL-The spot selected for camp is a knoll of slight eminence on Muck prairie, west of the road, and one mile north of where a stream of the same name crosses it. The surface of the ground is rolling and the prairie about a mile wide between the nearest eastern and western belts of pine and hemlock trees. Two hundred yards north of the camp grnund there is a clump of trees extending three-fourths of a mile from the road in a southeasterly direction, the eastern boundary of this clump being a nearly north and south line. Between the southeast corner of the clump and the eastern belt bounding Muck prairie there is an open space of half a mile which permits a view in the direction of sunrise, (at that time of the year.) .A.hove the pine and fir-belt seen in this last direction, and some five miles diRtant, a very slight eminence of the Cascade mountains is visible, its elevation above the ground line being 32' 20". Assuming the (magnetic) variation to be 22° easterly, the bearing of the centre of the eminence is N. 64° E.; and that of Mt. Rainier, a lofty snow-clad summit of the same range, S. 33° E. Between the forest bounding the southern line of the prairie and the Cascade mountains in that direction, the country is, apparently, much lower. A part of the mountain-ranges con· stituting the northern base of .Mt. Rainier is visible over the eastern fir-belt attd between the SE. by S., and south points of the compass, the entire chain is seen in broken ranges, the nearest of which is estimated to be 25 miles distant. The lowest depression in the range is the Cowlitz pass, which bears S.SE. Mt. Rainier appears as a triply pointed cone, covered with snow as far dClwn as the forest permits vision-perhaps more than 10, 000 feet! A most noble object it is to look upon. After the tents had been pitched under the shadow of the trees, near the northwestern angle of the prairie, a computation of the sun's amplitude for the morning of the eclipse showed that the eastern extremity of the northern bounding pine-clump would obstruct the earliest rays. In consequence thereof, a site for the telescopes was selected S. 85° E., and 550 feet distant from the spot on which the observations for time and latitude were made. It is ten feet higher than the ground at the camp, and commands a better view to the northeast. From a mean of all the barometrical observations made at camp and rednced to 32° Fah., and upon the assump· tion that the barometer at the level of Puget sound reduced to the same temperature stands at 30 in., tho elevation of the camp knoll is 350 feet; that of the telescope knoll 360 feet. Adjustments and observations.-On the day after our arrival at camp the cistern barometer was suspended from a strong bracket nailed to the large oak tree which over.shadowed the tent, and in such position that it was shielded from the sun in the morning by the tent; at noon by the trunk of the tree; and in the afternoon hy a screen. Its cistern was two feet above the ground. The air and wet bulb thermometers, Nos. 1637 A and B, were placed beside it, and the latter was moistened at least five minutes before reading it from a cup of water kept near. The radiating thermometer was placed in front of the tent and its bulb just clear of the ground. A wind-vane was made by tying a bit of tape to the highest twig of an oak bush from which all the bran.::hes had been cut, and staking the gronnd at the cardinal points. Our sheltered posit.on rendered its indications doubtful at times, and, therefore, both the direction and the strength of the wind were quite as frequently estimated from the motions of the trees above and around us as from the vane. These instruments were placed in charge of the assistants, and, except at 3 a. m., from which hour I excused them, observations were made tri-hourly until midnight of July 18. 'fhose made at brief intervals, on the morning of the eclipse, by Mr. James Gilliss, are incorporated in the series. At my i·equest Dr. Jo;mph B. Brown, U. S. A., in charge of the hospital at Fort Steilacoom, very promptly and courteously promised a corresponding series for the morning of the eclipse,

and his observations are given elsewhere. If the temperature shown therein differs from that noted on Muck prairie more than the distance between the two places will satisfactorily explain, perhaps it may be accounted for by the fact that the thermometers at the latter were freely exposed in the open air, whilst those at the hospital are in a sheltered corner under a porch, on its south front.

Observations for time and latitude were made with the sextant and artificial horizon morning, afternoon, and night of every available day whilst we were in camp. The inverting telescope and highest magnifying power were used throug·bout. The index error was ascertained both morning and afternoon by at least three measurements of the sun's diameter, on and off the arc. Whether its steady increase during the earlier days of observation was an actual progressive change, or only an apparent one, arising from want of experience with that particular construction of instrument, I cannot say. The computations have been made by Mr. John Wiessner, U. S. Coast Suney, and the data and results for latitude are given in the following table:

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

a.nd after the stand of the comet-seeker had been adjusted for verticality by the level attached thereto, its polar axis was (first) brought approximately in the meridian by means of a pocket compass divided to 1 :.o. Its eye end was next turned until the motion of the sun was parallel to one of the lines engraved on the glass lamina, and then the focus was adjusted upon the sun's limb and spots. At later hours the diameters of the inner engraved circles were measured by tra!lsits of the o;un' s limbs over them, and the azimuth of the polar axi,,; examined at the eastern elongation of Polaris. Ko attempt was made to correct for any error that might have existed in the elevation (47°) of the polar axis. The other telescope was placed a few feet to ihe south of the comet-seeker, the . top of its stand made horizontal, and the tripod legs pressed firmly into tlrn ground whilst so adjusting it. Its eye-piece was .then moved until the sun's image cast upon the screen was the sharpest, and at the same time two of the shadows of the engraved lines on the diaphragm \Vere respectively parallel with and perpendicular to the top and side uf the box. Each of tlie assistauts had carefully studied the suggestions prepan;d for the Coast Survey observer,; by Dr. B~ A. Gould and Prof. Jos. Henry, and the duties as,,;igned to them were briefly as follows: Mr. Mosman had had some experience in a;;;tronomical observations. The telescope with dark clrnmber, the sidereal chronometer, and sheets of paper with circles drawn upon them to conespond with the images of t!wse in the diaphragm were therefore given to him. A differently mounted instrument would have afforded him ample material:; for notes and drawings of the phenomena. The meteorologicnl instruments were suspended from a temporary tripod erected just west of the telescopes, nnd ·were placed in charge of .Mr. James Gilliss, who was also to record changes in colors, the nmount of light, and all other information IJot requiring the use of a te1e8cope. :For the purpose of aiding him in recogniziug and distinguishing them a diagram had been prepared to show the places of the planets and brighter stars then in the vicinity of the suu. The£>e duties were deemed quite sufficient to occupy him without the additional task of calling aloud the secouds of a chronometer, as propoo;ed by Dr. Gould, for one assistant, (of three,) and therefore Mr. :Mosman and myself were each to note time for himself, to which end I had chosen the chronometer with steel hands. Trrn ECLTPSE. For the first time after our arrival at the station selected the sun rose clear on the morning of July 17th, nor was there more than two-tenths of the sky obscnred by clouds at any time during that day. llut I h<.:d no confidence in the state of the ·weather. The experience of three weeks in \Vashington Territory had been of rapid change from fair to mist, or fog, or cloud, sometimes over one, sometimes over another part of the heavens, and the prognostics one has a right to make from ordinary meteorological intelligence were constantly at fault. Therefore, although the eveuing of the 17th was absolutely cloudless, and the stars were shiniug with remarkable lustre after mi<luight, yet wheu we closed the tent, three hours before the eclipse began, neither of us could venture to predict a favorable morning for tho ob:,ervations. By half past three a. m. we were up and had removed the meteorological instruments to tho telescope knoll. Even at that time it was sufficiently light to write without urt.ificial aid. Mount Rainier was distinctly visible and sharply cut against the southeastern sky, its towering cone of snow mellowed to a bluish glacier tint. Beyond it, and thence northward in the direction of sunrise, there was a stratum of vapor whose upper line was slightly inclined from mid-height of the mountains to the horizon. The barometer stood at 29. 698 in.; attached thermometer 44°. 5; temperature of the air 45°. 2; and there was only a very light air from the southward.

TIIE UNITED STATES COAST SUUYEY.

At 4h. Gm. the mist strire became demer to the northward and eastward. They were more evidently in rays diverging from the point occupied by the sun, and were traceable to an elevation of 25° at the extreme limit southward. Then the air waR Ro loaded with moisture that the cold was e_xceedingly penetrating, and although the telescope had been completely exposed all 11ight the object glasses were densely covered with drops very soon after the caps were removed. By 471.. 19m. a part of the vapor to the northeast had condensed beyond the Cascade mountains into little cumuli, each one more light and feathery with its distance from tho divcrg·ing- point, though none of them extended so far as Mount Rainier, and it was only to tlrn soutlnrnrd of the peak that a broad volume of vapor was seen pouring through the Cowlitz pass towards tbe low lands bordering on Puget sound. Two minutes later and the edges of the little ftocu1i were bordered with hues of pink and gold, which increased in dcvth and lirilliancy of coior as the sun approached the horizon. The moon had advanced far .upon the sun's disc when the first cusp appeared on the horizon at 471. 29m. 52s. It was seen through a red screen glass; and the image was sharp aud without tremor. Indeed, the atrnos11hcrc was so still that tlie rise of the second cusp ever the distant ground line at 4h. 3lm. 108. ·was observed with almost as much precision as its transit could have been over the wire of a meridian telescope. But it ·was at once perceived that the1·e was great distortion of the lune, unequal refraction apparently flattening its lower half. Immediately thereafter it was again necessary to wipe the heavy dew drops from the object glass of the telescope, and whilst so doing my attention was directed to the surface vapor which had formed 11ear us. Apparently the whole of the northeastern and lower portion of the prairie was a placid lake embowered among towering pines and hemlocks, and dotted with miniature isles, an illui;ion which waf'< enhanced by rapidly diminishing intensity of the sunlight. It was so still and so smooth that I almost expected to see reflections of the trees and shadows of the knolls which formed its islets. At 4h. 43m. distant objects could n"ot be recognized more distinctly than during midsummer twilight in latitude 45° at 8! p. m.; and though Mt. Rainier still reflected rays from the sun, the 1'1ky beyond it and in every direction from us was of a leaden hue and without transparency. The countenances of the at::sistants had become of a grceuish-yellow color, and the ever darkgreen forests were really black. At 4h. 44m. the southern cuRp lrnd become rounded off and jagged, as though the moon's edge was serrated. But had such been the case this portion of the lune would have been broken into beads of light before the total obscuration took place, a phenomenon wnich did not occur, the moon's disc equally and uniformly interposing between us and the sun nntil the last particle of light vanished at 4/z. 4 7m. 29s.9. I must not be understood as meaning to eon...-ey the idea that the attenuated diminishing crescent was a corn~tantly continuous hand of Jiglit, uniformly disappearing from the hvo extremities, for such was not the case. Though never of that silvery color, both horns resembled the surface of the moon just coming into ;mnligbt when many portions are brighter tl1an others, and sometimes from one and sometimes from the other considerable portions dropped off like filaments of melting metal. I had turned off the red screen half a minute before, and was g uite surprised that the following segment of the lunar sphere was distinctly visible through more than 100°. Its color was uniformly shaded from an intense black at the ceutre to a dark grayish purple on the Western border, and for the first time in my life the moon was visible in its true form-a sphere and not a disc. There was as great a difference between its appearance then and that to which I liad been accustomed, as there is between a single photograpll and a stereoscopic picture. This spherical figure was traceable during 20s. after the last glimmer of suulight. .A.t the moment of totality beads of golden and ruby-colored light flashed almost entirely around the moon_ They were not c·mstant in dimensions or color at one point, even for .a

second, but fitfully flickering, as reflections from rippled water, and as mutable in the respective places of color. I do not think this band could have been more than 1011 or 1211 broad. It was generally separated from the sharp lunar disc by a delicate line of white light, which disappeared as the changes of form or color took place. It broke up suddenly at 4h. 47m. 56s. 5, and then for the first time protuberances were noted beyond the following limb of the moon. The position of the largest 01ie was S. 75° or 78° ·w., and its general form that of a flattened cone or pyramid of cumulus clovd, which, when first observed, was perhaps 2' broad at the base, and 1 1 high. It was not regular in outline or uniform in color, but apparently an aggrega-. tion of smaller clouds, tinted a rosy pink at the denser portions, but with edges and occasional spots of yellowish-white, as though sunlight shone obliquely through them. Except in the pink color, it greatly resembled the protuberances noted during the total eclipse of the sun observed at Olmos, September 7, 1858. As the moon moved onward it was certainly broader at the base and brighter at the summit than when first recognized, though I cannot say that its apparent altitude was increased thereby. Nevertheless I am positive that it was uncovered by and did not follow the moon. Synchronous with this, a smaller mass of a more flattened appearance, but having the same colors, was visible 10° or 15° towards the west, and many other lesser ones at different points of the disc. Only the places of these two were recorded at the time. A.t a later period a continuous chain, more than 30::. long and above 3Q1' high, was seen on the S. E. border. This also was sketched. Its edge was exceedingly ragged, and the rapid view given to it impressed me that its color was dark-quite as obscure as that of lead, which is presumptive evidence of the presence of the corona light, though the latter had not then arrested attention. In fact, believing that more valuable information would be gained by closely observing one of the prominences than from an effort merely to loca.te many or the coronal phenomena, I had given nearly my whole time to the extremely brilliant and beautiful object whose description has been attempted. 'l'hif' examination confirms an opinion formed in 1858, and I am moBt thoroughly convinced that the masses which became visible apparently around the lunar disc were really clouds belonging to the solar atmosphere. Two illustrations for different periods of the eclipse have been prepared by Mr. McMurtrie, U. S. Coast Survey, from my rough sketches and verbal account. They embrace all the phenomena witnessed at any time during the totality, of which a record was made at the time. Figure I (Sketch "!'io. 39) i:> not strictly in accordance with fact, because the moon has been intentionally represented under its most spherical aspect, which was actually before the final occu1tation. Moreover, the dimensions and places of the filaments composing the colored circles are intended as illustrative of the general appearance, and not as a photograph of the actual picture. Interest in the principa1 solar cloud not only caused temporary forgetfulness of the corona, as has been acknowledged, but also the beat of the chronometer had been lost, and as the total phase was passing rapidly it became necessary to look at the dial of the instrument again. 'l'his afforded an opportunity to glance at objects between the northeast and south-southeast points of the landscape without rising from my chair. But it was dark as night, and only a i;hadowy outline of the near forest could be seen; all beyond it, even the snow mantle of Mount Rainier was lost in the deep gloom. I was seated entirely free from bodily constraint, with the chronometer on the telescope-stand and within two feet of the eye; but as it was too obscure for me to distinguish the marks of the second' s dial, even when stooping to within a few inches of them, Mr. James Gilliss was warned to bring his lantern and record the time at which I should indicate the second internal contact of the two limbs. I could not have been bent over the chronometer more than 8s. or 10s. before my face was again lifted towards the telescope, and in so doing a most extraordinary scene was apparent. A totally different picture had been substituted for the black disc which only a brief instant before was seen circled by a tremulous band of vermilion or red, and yellow lights, overlapped

by the solar clouds. True, the disc was there, but'it was thrown in bold relief upon a ground of virgin white, traceable in every direction for the distance of quite a scmidiametcr. The solar clouds were there also, but the gorgeous circlet was gone, and over the jetty surface, colors of the spectrum apparently flashed in circular bawls of equal diameter with the moon . .A spectacle so remarkable thoroughly startled me from the equa11irnity with which thB preceding phenomena had been observed, and I was irresistibly drawn to its contemplation, to the neglect of changes that might have been taking place in the borders of the solar douds and corona. As near as it was possible to estimate thew, each band or circular !'egrnent was about 2' broad. Its colors were crimson or red, violet, yellow, and green, the last one being on the edge over the lunar centre, and of a tint not darker than that known as pea-green. The bands of red and green were wider than those of violet and yellow. 'l'hey were not visible beyond the borders of the moon; and as each seemed to be in rapid revolution downward towards the lunar centre, their relative places appeared to be incessantly changed, like those of a kaleidoscope, more closely than anything else with which I can compare them. They continued visible with the telescope at least 10s. longer, and vanished at 4h. 49ni. 25s.3 with the first appearance of the sunlight beyond the western limb of the moon, their sudden obliteration causing me to utter an exclamation which was regarded as the signal for noting the time, a datum whose importance had been forgotten in the fascination thus caused. Figure II (Sketch No. 39) is intended to represent the phase of the eclipse just described. The proportions and angles of poi;ition are correct. ~<tpparently the colors are a little too deep, but this would disappear was it possible to imitate the exquisite shading of the natural spectrum, a difficulty which augments rapidly as the scale of the picture diminishes. In the present case the imperceptible passing from one color was simply impossible. Both representations are as seen in an invertiug telescope, the upper points of the discs being south. Was the phenomenon wholly physiological? The dimensions and relative places of the prismatic segments are in accordance with the law of accidental or subjective colors, and seem to indicate it. But if so, the spectrum bands should have been seen immediately after taking the eye from the telescope, whilst I was bending over the chronometer in efforts to recognize the divisions of the seconds dial, and when, if ever, the images of the brilliant colors around the lunar border should have been vivid. This was not the case, nor were they perceived until at the instant of looking upward from a small object on which (the chronometer heing iu a mahogany box) the only colors were porcelain white and Japan black. This fact, its subsequent visibility in the telescope, and the analogous, if not precisely similar spectacle, seen by Mr. Goldsborough from Fort Steilacoom, seem to justify a doubt whether it can be attributed to an abnormal condition of the retina. The contemporaneous presence of a corona light with the prismatic segments has been adverted to, as well as the fact that the latter had monopolized my attention. Iu consequence of th~ monopoly, I can only add to what has been mentioned of the former; that it was composed of radial beams or streamers-with slightly darker or fainter intersticel'l, rather than of a disc of regularly diminishing or suffusing light, and that it was apparently concentric with the moon, from whose border outwards the light grew less and less until totally lost at the distance of 15' to 18'. Within five seconds after the sun emerged, I looked carefully for the corona and greater solar cloud, and then for the eastern limb of the moon, but not the slightest trace could be seen of either of the former. There was a faint edging of ruddy light near that border of the moon, and close examination enabled me to detect a dark purplish shading from thence towards its centre; but it continued only a very brief period, and even when the shading was most distinct the-globular figure was not a characteristic as before the totality. The termination of the total phase permitted me to look at surrounding objects. Again the object-.glass of the telescope was found to be excessively wet, and the tube and stand, neither

At

4li. 5Cm. the countenances of the assistants were more pallid and corpse-like than at 4lt. 43m.,

and light seen against the forest belts was of a sickly yellow hue. Interposing my hand so as to cut off direct rays from the sun, the northeastern sky was of a dark purple; Mount Rainer, to the southeast, of a soft, milky hue. From thence to the southwest the color changed by imperceptible degrees to a greenish blue, or perhaps more nearly a bronzed blue; and finally, in the same circuit to the northeast again, through similar faint shadings, to those visible diametrically opposite. · Closely around the following limb as it passed over the sun and until it was beyond the centre of the latter, was a delicate violet or reddish blue fringe, which made it difficult to detect the exact instant at which the solar spots emerged, and only one of them, whose occultation also had been noted-was observed with any degree of satisfaction. The fringe disap· peared gradually. With the low magnifying power used, the only one sent with the cometseekcr, I was unable to detect inequalities on the lunar limb, and at 5k. 42m. 28s.2 it finally separated from that of the sun without other notable phenomenon. A. mist curtain had commenced rolling from the west before the end of the eclipse, and at 6h. 4m. there was not a portion of the sky visible in any direction. Two hours later the heat of the sun forced the screen upward in cumulous masses, leaving us with a warm and slightly humid atmosphere, until the regular 110rthwcst wind set in towards 9 o'clock. For the purpose of introducing the observed occultation of one of the spots on the disc of the sun in its proper place, I recapitulate certain of the times already given in the text.

Observations for time and latitude were repeated during the day and evening, and on the 19th the instruments were repacked. Beneath the spot on which the comet-seeker stood a bottle, containing a suitable inscription, was buried, and a mound of stones three feet high erected thereupon. A.s the land can scarcely be regarded arable, it is not probable that this will be disturbed; but should it be, the bottle is beneath the reach of a plough, and the site is well known to persons at Steilacoom as well as by the occupants of the adjoining farm. We returned to Fort Steilacoom on the 19th. On the 23d Mr. Mosman was instructed to rejoin his party at Gray's harbor, and Yr. Gilliss and myself embarked for San Franpisco. Directing him, at the latter place, to report to Assistant Davidson, I left it on the 1st August and arrived at Washington on the 25th. One word more. The occasion of our visit to Washington Territory was one of great interest to the highly accomplished officers of the army at Fort Steilacoom also, and their kind and intelligent counseJ, their ever present readiness to facUitate every object of the expedition, and their most cordial hospitality to us, elicit our warmest and most grateful acknowledgments.

~~Iosman,

U. S. Coast Survey.

Sky cloudless at 4 a. m., with a thick haze near the horizon. The first ray of light sl1one on Mount Rainier at 4h. 25m. At sunrise a bank of thin c:louds restcu on the (NE.) horizon, but the sun rose rapidly through them. First internal contact at lh. 2lm. 52s.3 by siderial chronometer;+ (4/t. 47m. 2'is.G M. T.) As t~e lune of sunlight decreased, the preceding limb of the moon appeared of a light green color, whilst the inner limb of the sun was of a rose color.t At the moment of conta<:t the (t>uu's) limb was broken into bead-like spots, (see rough sketch,) id1ich disappeared one after another, until the one at A was the last visible point of light. During this change the Leads were of rainbow hue, green and red predominating. After the eclipse became total I was unable to use my telescope, because there was not light enough to cast an image on the screen. On this accouut tho time of tho reappearnnce of light was marked by my naked eye, but as I was at the same time engaged in recording for Mr. Gilliss, the observation was doubtful. Time of reappearance, U. 22m. 39s.8, (4h. 48m. 15s.1.):t During the time of the totality I recorded tho time of appearance of the protuberances, &c., for Mr. Gilliss, and therefore was unable to notice its phases minutely. The protuberances were of a golden hue, with a slight tinge of rod. The corona '."<l8 a compound of red, gold, and green. Its width appeared nearly equal to the radius of the moon, aur1 it seemed to be formed by radial rays from the centre. Its width was constant and apparently concentric throughout the eclipse, with a slight wavy motion to and fro. As the light incrnased I again followed the sun 'with the telescope, keeping t1rn imago upon the screen. End of the eclipse, 2h. 17m. 12s.5 by sidereal chronometer, (fis. 42m. 288. S.) The telescope used was Coast Survey reconnoitering telescope 1\o. 10, of 4 foet focal IeIJgth, 3 iuches object glass, and fitted "·ith a dark chamber at its eye-end, in which a screen of white paper was placed to receive the image of the sun. As the instrument had neither damp uor tangent screws, and there were no means of giving a small motion to the telescope, either in a horizontal or a vertical direction, the image of tlw snn could not be kept in thtJ centre of the field, and the plan first attempted for obtaining drawiugs of the sun was im1Hacticable. Consequently, the rough sketches taken on the 15th and 17th ~Yore done liy 01w person keeping the sun as nearly as possible to the centre of tLe field, whilst a second one rapidly drew the visible spots, their angles of position being fixed by the circles and lines of the diaphragm shadowed on the screen and corresponding with similar ones on paper held by the obsernn-. Soon after the end of the eclipse the sky became clouded over so that no drawiu~ could be made of the spots. A. T. 11108.'.ILiS.

I beg leave to submit the following remarks in relation to the solar ccliptw of this morning: The first rays of light, indicating the rising of the sun above the Cascade mountains, \Vere of a pink color, and were visible at 4h. 22m. a. rn.; but they were not of the Fame tint on the northeastern slope of Mount Rainier until 5 minutes afterward. The fin;t cu;;p of the sun was seen at 4h. 30m. It was of a reddish color, aud apparently had :t wavy motion, which contiirned until the time of totality.

Preceding and during the latter event the atmosphere continued perfectly calm, but after the reappearance of the sunlight a light air could be perceived from the southward. This wind contiune<l and gradually increased during several hours, though changing to the northward and westward by the afternoon. I was prevented from observing any of tho astronomical phenomena during the totality, becam;e it had become so dark that the figures on the dial of the chronometer could no longer be distinguished by tlie observer using the telescope with the dark chaml,er, aud I was unexpectedly called upon to note the time. The darkness had become so intense I feared for -an in,.;tant that I should not be able to take up the beat of the chronometer, but my eyes became accm;tomed to the suddenly diminished light* after a fow seconds, and I "lcYas enabled to recognize the division from which the seconds hand moved. At 5h. 4m. a reddish cumulo-Btrntus cloud had formed in the SW., which lasted several minute;-;. At 5h. 14m. there was a distinct mirage over a part of the prairie ten or twelve feet lower than the spot we stood upon, and between us and the sun. It seemed to be about a mile distant., and the images continued several minutes. There was so much moisture in the air that it was "·ith very great difficulty that the bulb of the air thennometer could be kept dry. 'l'he outline of Motmt Rainier was more distinct before the edipse than it had been at ally time during t11e preceding three weeks, clouds hitherto having prevented a perfect view near :its base, as seen from rnmp al1ove the fir belt to the SE. A diagrarn showing the -relative positions of the planets nearest the sun had been prepared, but in con,;equence of duties with the chronometer requiring all my attention during the brief time they might have been visible, I was prevented from looking for them.

JAMES GILLISS.

Frorn H. A. Goldsborough, Esq.
We selected a position, early yesterday morning, clear of the garrison lmildings, from whence a good horizon might be obtained, and where we were soon joined by nearly all the officers and ladies of the fort. Presently the aurora gave warning of the immediate appearance of the sun, who gradually presented himself in perfect beauty and form, except to the NE., where the moon had already overlapped liim probably one-eighth of his diameter. The progress of the moon's passage across the sun's disc was beautiful in the extreme, and at the period of totality there was tl10 most gorgeous sight I ever witnessed. The corona (apparently in width about the semi-diameter of the moon) gave forth brilliant scilltillations of almost every hue, with that peculiar etincelant which we see in the pyrotechnic Catherine's wheels; yellow, blue, scarlet, rosy, and an indescribable approach to green, appeared to Le intermingled, as if several sections of rainbows had been thrown promiscuously together. Mount Rainier, GO miles E. by S. of us, and some 15, 000 feet high, was palled in the thickest gloom. The air was calm to me, and remained so during the eutire transit; but I observed that the very conl"idcrable decreao;e of temperature was not pari pas8u or synchronous with the decroat:w of light, but th'.tt the latter was perceptibly in advance of the former. A greyhound belonging to one of the ladies of our party attracted marked attention by the evident trepidation manifested, and particularly at tho time of the greatest obscurity.

one, as you know-and though looking through it at the eclipse with all possible earnestness, there was not the slightest inconvenience to my eyes. I congratulate you mo;;t sincerely that your jouruey from Washington has been crowned with such complete succeRs. H. A. GOLDSDOROUGH. FORT STEILACOOM, July 19, 1860.

From llfc1;jor G. 0. Haller, U. S. A.
Agreeably to your request, I herewith submit a few items which came under my oh3crvation, or can be well authenticated, connected with the eclipse of the sun on the 18th instant. A point on the southeastern sbore of Wallace's (Anderson's?) islarn], in Puget !"ound, ·va:-: selected by Captain George Henry Richards, commanding her Britannic Majesty's steamer Plumper, for observing the eclipse, and, by his invitation, I there became "a looker on." From this station the sun was obse1·ved i·ising in unclouded majesty, hnt piutially eclipsed. I found that the direct rays of the sun were endurable to my unpracticed eye. The waters of the sound were calm, smooth, and polished, and reflected the sun's light like a vast mirror, and during the ·total eclipse the corona was reflected by the water, giving a subdued and agreeable light to the eye, sufficient, I believe, for both reading instruments an<l writiug notes. Wh-n the sun was totally eclipsed I took a look around to obt'lerve tho effect of the :mbducd light upon the scenery. 'l'o the southwest all nature appeared as if wrapt in ni~ht, feebly illuminated by a rising moon. Eastwar<l I could see :Mount Rainier, "·hich was clearly \\·ithin the limits of the moon's shadow, and visible as it often is in a pale moonlight; but 1iot a sing·lc ray from the sun illuminated its snow-capped summit. Several stars appeared above the sun, and bright crimson light "·as ohsern·d immediately about the edge of the moon, in three or four places; but all my faculties l"eemed tci be too wrapped up in the undefinable and indescribable grandeur of tlie corona to giYe my attention to details. The effect of this unusual appearance was very marked upon animals. The cattle in the barn-yard at Fort Kisqually were very much disturbed and greatly frightened. At Fort Stei· lacoom the dogs were observed to be terribly alarmed. The view of the sun was uninterrupted until a few seconds after t}1e two spots on the lower part of tllC disc had made their appearance, about which time a mist began to thicken the atmosphere, and a fe\v seconds before the last contact the sun was completely ,>b:"cured by clouds. G. 0. HALLER. FonT STEILACOOM, July 21, lSGO.

From Lieut. T lwmas L. Gasey, U. S . .A.
In accordance with your request, that I should give you my recollections of such phenomena as I noticed in connection with the solar eclipse of the 1 Sth instant, I would state that, th auks to a cloudless sky and a good position, I was enabled to have a fi11e view of this mosl wonderful occurrence. As I was not provided with instruments, un<l merely observed Ilic different pha!'es of tho eclipse through a piece of smoked glaEs, I slrn11 only attempt to speak of the appearance as presented to me at totality. Just before the light of the suu had entirely disappeared 1 liad put aside my g1ass, and was

292

REPORT OF THE SVPERINTENDFNT OF

watching the fast-disappearing disc of that body, when I was startled by the sudden flashing out of the most beautiful fringe of light all around the disc of the moon. Its extent beyond the disc appeared to be about the lunar semi-diameter, and its edges were not well defined, but faded gradually away, the width of the fringe being greater in some than in other places. To me this corona had a peculiar greenish-yellow hue, which approached more nearly white light near the disc of the moon. At several places in it I noticed bright yellow flame-like coruscations, as though streaming through b1dentations in the edge of the disc. There were several of these, the largest one of which was at the upper left hand limb of tlrn moon. The corona did not disappear on tho reappearance of the sun, as it had flashed forth, but was perceptible a few seconds longer. In that time the wlwle disc of the moon was well defined, that part of it opposite to the uncovered part of the sun having a narrow band of light mound it, giving it the appearance which is vulgarly described as "the old moon in the arms of the new." The darkness upon the earth was not nearly so great as I had expected to experience; for I was enabled to distinguish the hands upon my watch, and to note the time, with the greatest ease. Although the sky was perfectly cloudless, that part of the heavens opposite to the sun prm;ented a dark and murky appearance, as though a thunderstorm was rising in that quarter. I greatly regret that I did not arrive here in time to see you before your departure for your observing station, in order that I might have heard from you a description of the eclipse of 1858, and thus, being better prepared for the appearances I was to observe, I could have noted them with more intelligence. As it is, the above are the features \vhicb impressed themselves upon my mind with the greatest force, and which, if they will be of any service to you, it gives me great pleasure to communicate.

.Discuss,ion qf the nicigneHc and mefeorologiml observations made at tl1P Gfrard Oulleg<: observatory, Philadelphia, in 1840, 1841, 1842, 1843, 1844, and 1845. Part II.-Inee&tigation qf tlie solardiurnal variation in the magnPfic declination, and its annnal ine']vality. By A. D. Bache, LL.D.
Having discmised, in Part I, the eleven year period in the amplitude of tlie solar-diurnal variation, as well as in the disturbances of the magnetic declination, I now proceed to the analysis of the annual inequality of the Rolar-dinrnal variation. To obviate the difficulty which would occur in cases of mouths of unusual disturlrnuce if the crude observations were used, the normals 01· meaus freed from the disturbances have Leen employed in the discussion. This mode of proceeding not only oLviates the neceBsity for rejecting the observations for particular months, but briugs out the most consistent results wl1ich the observations can furnish for both diurnal and annual variation. It is the course adopted by Genei-al Sabine in the t!1ird volume of his discussion of the Toronto oLservations.* Returning, then, to the hourly normals, they are rearranged in the tables whid1 follow according to the different months of the year. The normals for 1840 are corrected for the inde:x: error by the addition of 93. 3 scale divisions. All correction,; for referring the partial monthly readings to the annual mean are, of cour,;e, omitted.

This table shows plainly the relation of the mean hourly position of the magnet of each month to its general moan position after the separation of the larger disturbances, and also, by running t11e eye along any horizontal line, tbe solar diurnal variation for each month. It does not, however, show distinctly the annual inequality, on account of the changes in the numbers from the secular change. To eliminate the effect of this change, each hourly normal has been compared, in the following table, with the corresponding mean monthly value, as given in the last right hand column, the sign indicating a westerly deviation, and - an easterly deviation* of the north end of the magnet from the mean monthly position. The scale divisions have been converted into minutes of arc.

The distinctive features of the above table are next to be considered analytically as well as graphically. The inequality in the diurnal variation is most conspicuous when the tabular numbers in the horizontal lines for the months of February and August are compared. The annual variation appears plainest by carrying the eye over the vertical column at the hours 6 or 7 a. m. The annual variation depends on the earth' B position in its orbit, the diurnal variation being subject to an inequality depending on the sun's declination. The diurnal range is

greater when the sun bas north declination, and smaller when south declination, the phenomenon passing from one stale to the other about the time of the equinoxes. To shm\· the diurnal variation at these periods, the summer and winter means, as well as the annual means, were tabulated. The months from April to September (inclusive) comprise the summer period, and from October to March (inclusive) the winter period. The first diagram, (A,) on Sketch No. 7, shows this variation, and contains the type curves for these half-yearly periods. We find for the summer months a diurnal range of nearly 10~ minutes, and for the "·inter months of but 5~ minutes. These and other curves will be further analyzed hereafter~ Tlie second diagram, (B,) Sketch, No. 'T, exhibits the same phenomenon in a different way, the yearly curve of the first diagram being straiglli.Pned out and forming the axis of the second diagram, which thus shows the deviations from the annual mean value for the two seasons, when the sun bas north and south declination. The ordinates are obtained by subtracting the annual mean from either the summer or winter mean in the preceding table. This diagram furt}1er exliibits in quite a characteristic manner the course of the annual variation at the different hours of the day at the season for which the diagram is constructed. Thus at the hours six or seven in the morning the annual variation is a maximum, disappearing at a quarter before 10 a. m., aud reaching a second (secondary) maximum value at 1 p. m. It almost disappears soon after 5 p. m., and a third still smaller maximum is reached after 9 p. n1.; half an hour before midnight the annual variation again disappears. At (and before ancl after) the principal maximum between six and seven in the morning the annual variation cau<ics the north end of the magnet to be deflected to the east in summer and to the west in winter, at 1 p. m. the deflection,,; are to the west in summer and to the east in winter. The range of the diurnal motion is thus increased in summer and diminished in winter; the magnet being· deflected in summer more to the east in tho morning hours, and more to the west in the afternoon hours, or having greater elongations than it would have if the sun moved in the equator. In winter tho converse is the case. The range of the annual variation from summer to winter is about 31 .0, and its daily range about 2'.6 at Philadelphia. The next diagram (C) has been projected in order to illustrate the semi-annual inequality of the diurnal variation at four principal magnetic stations.* The general features of the Philadelphia curve most nearly resemble those exhibited by the St. Helena curve, and relatively the Toronto and Hoharton curves appear to represent rather extremes than normal shapes. The Philadelphia and St. Ilelena curves have another feature in common, the amplitude at its maximum value shortly after 6 a. m. is less than the amplitude at Toronto and Hobarton; and upon the whole the Philadelphia type confirms the idea that all forms partake of the same general character, more or lei;:s affected by incidental irregularities. In reference to the ammal variation, General Sabine, in the "rectifications and additions" to the last volume of Humboldt's Cosmos, expresses himself as follows: * * * "Thus in each hemisphere the semi-annual deflections concur with those of the mean annual variation for half the year, and consequently augm~nt them, and oppose and diminish them in the other half. At the magnetic equator there is no mean diurnal variation, but in each half year the alternate phases of the sun's annual inequality constitutes a diurnal variation, of which the range in each day is about 3' or 4', taking place every day in the year except about the equinoxes, the march of this diurnal variation being from east in the forenoon to west in the afternoon, when the sun has north declination, and the reverse when south declination." * * * According to the same authority the annua.l variation is the same in both hemispheres, the north end of the magnet being deflected to the east in the forenoon, the sun having north
" The annual variation of the diurnal motion has heen made the subject of a particular disem1sion by General Sabine in papr re presented to the British ABBo<:iation and to the Royal Society. See reports of the ,British Auociation, 1854, pp. 355 ·-36~, and Trans. Royal Society, May 18, 18"4, pp. 67-82; a.lso, art. :.:xviii, PhilOBOphical Trans., 1851.

declination, when in the diurnal variation the north end of the magnet at that time 0f the day is deflected to the east in the northern hemisphere, and to the west in the southern hemisphere. In other words, in regard to direction, the law of the annual variation is the same, and that of the diurnal variation the opposite in passing from the uorthern to the southern magnetic hemisphere. I next proceed to consider more in detail the annual variation at the hours of six and seven in the morning, and of one and two in the afternoon, these being the hours of the principal and secondary maximum, roRpoctively. By subtracting the annual mean from each monthly value, at the respective hours, we obtain from the prec~din~ general table tlie follo\\~ing: columns:

.A. general inspection of the above columns containing the mean values shO\YS that, approximately, the solstices are the turning epochs of this annual variation, the signs changing at the time of the equinoxes. To ascertain how nearly this is true, and in order to obtain a more precise expression, the means of the two columns, (after changing the signs ih the second,) for ea,ch month, Tespectively, were put into an analytical form, using Bessel's well-known furrnula for periodic functions:
~- = 11· 78 sin. (0 90°) 0'.32 sin. (2 (} 180°;) or, ~ .. = 1'. 78 cos. 0-0'.32 sin. 2 8, the angle {}counting from January 1. The maximum values will occur on tho first of January and the firllt of July, and the transition from a positive to a negative value, and tho reverse, will take place on the first of April and the first of October, the equation l'. 78 cos. 8=0'. 32 sin. 2 ()being only satisfied for 6 90° and 270°. That the angles 0 1 and 0 2 should be exactly 90° and 180° is remarkable. The monthly values are satisfied as follows:

The reguiar progression of the monthly values is a feature of the annual variation deserving particular notice. There is no sudden transition from the positive to the negative side, or, vice versa, at or near the time of the equinoxes, (certainly not at the vernal equinox;) on the contrary, the annual variation seems to be regular in its progressive changes. The method here pursued is entirely different from that employed by General Sabine for the same end; but the results are, nevertheless, in close accordance. He remarks, (in the British Association's report, above cited,) "when a mean is taken corresponding to the 10th or 11th day after the equinox the transition from the character of the preceding six months has already commenced and advanced very far towards its completion, and by the middle of October is qnite complete; apparently the progress of the change is somewhat more tardy in the March than in the September equinox.'' l!'rom the above analysis we have found that the transition took place ten days after either equinox, and, also, that the turning points occur ten days after the solstices. Por the more precise determination of the law of the phenomenon, and in order to render the results of similar investigations comparable with one another, the regular solar-diurnal variation is now to be ex.pressed as a function of the time. The preceding talmlar values, given in minutes of arc, when treated as required by Bessel's* periodic function, furnish the following expressions for each month of the year: For January· · · · For February · · For March.·· - · · For April ···..· For May·.····· For June · · · · · ·

In the above table + signifies westerly and - ea,;forly deflection; it may lie compared with similar tables constructed for Toronto*, DuLlill'I-, and Prague+. It will ho obsen·ed tlu1t the preceding taLle, which gives the oLserved variation, refers to an epoch 19k minutes later than the exact local hour, (that is, to an exact Gottingen hour,) whcrea,; the computed table refe1s to the exact Philadelphia hours. From the computed taLular value!:!, aided by the diagrams, we can now deduce some of the general features of the diurnal variation and it:; annual inequality. The general character of the diurnal motion (see type curves) is nearly the same tlHoughout the year ; the most eastern deflection is reached a quarter before 8 o'clock in ihe morning, (about a quarter of an hour earlier in summer, and half an hour later in winter,) near this hour the declination is a minimum; the north end of tho magnet then begins to move westward and reaches its westward elungation about 11 quarter after one o'clock in the afternoon, (a few minutes earlier in summer.) At this time the declination attains its maximum value. The diurnal curve presents but a single wave, slightly interrupted b,y a deviation occurring during the hours near midnight, (from about 10 p. m., to 1 a. m.,) when the magnet has a direct or westerly motion; shortly after 1 a. m. the magnet again assumes a retrograde motion and completes the cycle, by arriving at its eastern elongation shortly before 8 o'clock in tl,e morning. This noctural deflection is well marked in wintm·, vanishes in the summer months, and is hardly perceptible in the annual curve; accordiug to the investigations of Gen. Sabine, it is provable that if we had the means of entirely obliterating the -effect of disturhances, this smnil oscillation would almost disappear. In summer, when it has no existence, the magnet remains· nearly stationary between the hours of 8 p. m. and 3 a. m., a feature which is also shown by the annual type curve. The two preceding plates show a close genernl resemblance in the diurnal curves for the six months, when the sun has north declination, and a similar resemblance in the other six months, when it has south dec1ination. The analytical expression gives the epoch and amouut of variation with greater precision. The hours of minimum and maximum deflection are obtained from the equation d D. d O, and the hours of the mean declination when the curves cross

The effect of the seasons on the critical hours is well marked m the above table. The eastern elongation occurs earliest between the summer solstice and the autumnal equinox, and latest about the winter solstice; the western elongation occ11rs earliest about the autumnal equinox, and latest about the winter sofatice; and the same holris good for the morning epoch of the mean declination. The afternoon epoch, however, occurs earliest shortly after the autumnal equinox, and latest shortly after the summer solstice. The critical hours which vary le:-.st during the year are those of tbe western elongation and those of the morning mean declination, The extreme difference between the value for any month and tl10 mean annual value is 31 minutes in the former and 28 minutes in the latter. The graphical representation of three variables (Diagram G, Sketch No. 7) will serve to show at a glance the various features of the diurnal variation and its annual inequality. The magnetic surface is formed by contour lines O'. 5 apart; the dotted curves are lines of mean position; the curves represented by dashes correspond to eastern and the full curves to western deflection from the normal position. 'l'his diagram, as well as the computed tabular values from which it has been constructed, furnish the correction necessary to reduce any single observation taken at any hour of the day and month to its mean value. It also enables us, in a measure, to dispense with developing the annual variability of the coefficients B 1 B1 B 3 B4, and C1 0 2 C3· (or, rather, the

In most cases either a tabular or graphical interpolation between the two adjacent monthly values will fully answer ihe purpose. The diagram also distinctly exhibits the diurnal minima and maxima; the former represented by a valley, the latter by a ridge in the magnetic surface. The magnitude of the diurnal range is next to be considered.

The diurnal range for the summer months is 101.45; for the winter months, 5'.56; and for the whole year, 7'. 89; all conesponding to an epoch removed about one year and a half from the epoch of a minimum of the eleven year solar period. The numbers expressing the diurnal range exhibit three remarkable features, viz: the maxi· mum value in the month of August; the sudden falling off in the months of September and October, (see the graphical representation, Sketch No. 7 ;) and the minimum value in November or December. Otherwise, the progression is regular; the curve is single crested-a feature equally true for the eastern as well as for the western deflection when viewed separately. This latter circumstance is of special importance, Bince it is probable that it is mostly by the jnterferenee of these two separate curves that the curve of the diurnal range appears at some stations to be a double crested one. The curves for Milan, Munich, Gottingen, Brussels, Greenwich, Dublin, &c., for instance, exhibit two maxima: one after the vernal 1'q_uinox, and a second-generally the smaller one-about tho summeT solstice, with more or less regularity. The system to which Philadelphia belongs is exemplified by the annual curve of the diurnal range at Prague and at some of the Russian stations, especially at N ertschinsk, but principally at Toronto, for which last station the curve is shown in the diagram. Neither station appears to have a tendency to a secondary maximum about the month of .April, leaving the maximum about a month and a half after the summer solstice-a well-marked North American feature. Annual variation of the decH11aiivn.-In connection with the preceding discussion, the annual inequality in the magnetic declination next claims attention. This subject presents greater difficulty, inherent in the observations, than the diurnal inequality; not so much on account of the length of the period as on account.of the difficulty of keeping the instrument in precisely the same condition of adjustment throughout the year. In the first part of this discussion I have already bad occasion to refer to the circumstance while investigating the annual effect of the secular change; and it was there shown that the Philadelphia observations share in this

respect the difficulties of those of other stations,* in consequence of which the results must be received with caution. Returning to the last vertical column in the table, headed "Mean,'' we have there the monthly values of tue declinometer readings, (in scale divisions,) and in their differences, when compared month for month, the joint effect of the secular change and of the annual inequality. 'l'o eliminate the effect of the secular change, we determine its annual amount as follows: Sub· tracting the mean annual reading 559. 64, corresponding to July 1, from each monthly mean, and putting x =monthly effect of the secular change, (considered as uniform,) each monthly mean reading furnishes an equation for the determination of x. 'l'hus, for~ January, 4.56

= 5.5 x;

February, 3.34

= 4.5 x;

March, 5.22

= 3.5 x;

April, 4.38

= 2.5 x,

&c., which, when combined 1Jy application of the method of least square:,;, give x = ld.227; hence the annual change, 14d. 7, or 61· 7 of increasing westerly declination. t Deducting the effect of the secular change, and comparing the monthly remainders with their mean values, we obtain the annual inequality of the declination as follows:

According to these results, the magnet (north eud) is deflected to the east of its moan annual position in summer, and to the west in winter. It is, however, desirable, to test tho result. by su1mitting the first and the second 2~ years of observations, separately, to the same process of investigation. The first 31 months in the years 1840-' 41, and' 42 give a result almost identical with that just deduced; the remaining 27 months in the years 1843~' 44, and' 45, when discussed in the same manner, give a rather different result. Some improvement, however, can be made on the preceding investigation by omitting the December mean of 1844, which is obviously about 12 scale divisions too small. The observed value is 535cl.2, and tho interpolated value 547 d. 0. An examination of the first series shows a defect in the monthly means of 1841, between May and June, requiring a constant correction of 8. 0 scale divisions for the remaining months after May, as may be seen by the following table:

+

·It may be proper to give here in foll Dr. Lloyd's instructive note on this subject in his discussion of the Dublin observations: "The determination of the anmul variation ia much more difficult than that of the diurnal, both on account of the much smaller frequency of the period and the difficulty of preserving the instrument in the same unchanged condition during the much longer time, or of determining and allowing fo1· its changes when they do occur. Accordingly, although the annual period may be traced in the observations of Gilpin, and iB deci1lcdly displayed in those of llowditch, it has cvarled the resea.rche1; of 1·eeent observer<!. There is but a fa.int indication of its existence in the Gottiugen observa.tions, which were made a.t the bom·· of 8 a. m. and l p. m; and Frof. Gauss and Dr. Goldschmidt tind, in their ana!Jsis of these ob;crvations, nu important fluctuation dependent on season. A similar negative result is deduced by Dr. Lamont from tlw :Munich observations, which were made twelve times irt the rlay." t This value, (+ G'. 7 ,) "" resulting from a. different combin:.tion of oliservcd a.ud partly interpolat.ed value!!, may noi be pr.,foralile to that(+ 4'.5) deduced in part I of this discu·sion, but must necessarily be employed in the present investigation. The most reliable value 5'.0 was deduced from independent observations, IU! already remarked, and lies between the two.

The following values then remain for the discussion, aud they should be co11&idered ns forming the basis from which the legitimate results are to be deduced. The numbers marked with an asterisk have been increased hy 8d. 0. Interpolated values are bet"·een bracket~, and wc-ro obtained by comparing tlie meam; of the remaining months of the year with the corresponding mettns of every other year. By this process several values are obtained for each interpolated number; the resultiug mean is given in the table. The high value of 1841, and the low value of 1844-, for the month of ~fay, in some measure compensate.

This ·last result accords, in general, with that before deduced, but is much to be preferred. From .Tune to October the uurLh end of the magnet. is, accordiugly, to the eastward of the mean annual position, (after the elimination of the secular change,) and in tlie rcmaiuing montl1s of the year it is to the westward of this position. From the vernal equinox until after the summer solstice the motion is to the westward or retrograde, in regard to the adYance of the secular change (to the westward.) This il'.1 in conformity with the law as given by Dr. Lloyd in the Dublin discussion, where the motion of the magnet is to the westward at tlii;; period of the year, or the reverse of the Philadelphia deflection; but the secular cha11ge is likewise reversed, the west declination diminishing at Dublin at the same time or more accurately between 1840 and 1843. For further comparison I give here the results deduced from seven years' observation at Toronto between the years 1845 and 1851, a previous >rnrking up of a three yeanl' series (middle year, 1846) not being deemed sufficiently distinctive in it,; results. 'l'be 1:;ecular change is here 21.0 per annum increasing westerly dee! ination, wliereai:; it was 4'.4 per annum at Philadelphia in 1843. As in the above result., + indicates west; - , east deflection.

In regard to 1he amount of inequality, the two stations agree remarkably well, the range remaining slightly below 2' of arc. It has been supposed that this range at the same station is increasing or diminishing as the secular change increases or dimin.ishes. It may further be remarked that the general mean resulting from the above discussion at Philadelphia, viz., 560.4, is identical with the value given in Part I of the discussion, there deduced by an entirely different combination. The annual effect of the secular change, 4 1· 4, is likewise in very close conformity with the value given in Pa~t I, as found by a very different process. The monthly values of the annual variation may serve to give the corrections to observed declinations in any month of the year needed to refer the same to the mean declination of the year, and may also be used in the more refined discussion of the secular change;- ill both cases only when the greatest accuracy is required.

APPENDIX No. 24.
Discussion

ef tlte magnetic and meteorological observat£ons made at the Girard College Observatory, Ph,z-/adelphia, in 1840, 1841, 1842, 1843, 1844, and 184.5. Part III.-Investigation ef the i1iffoencc of the moon on the magnftic declination. By A. D. Bache, LL.D.

The existence of a sensible lunar effect on the magnetic declination has already been estab· li8hed by the labors of Brown, Kreil, Sabine, and others. It is, nevertheless, important to add the weight of new numerical results to those already obtained. In the discussions of the Philadelphia observations of magnetic declination already presented to the association, I have shown how the influence of magnetic disturbances of the eleven year period of the solar diurnal variation and its annual inequality ·of the secular change, and of the annual variation may be severally eliminated, leaving residuals from which the lunar influence is to be studied. Each observation was marked with its corresponding lunar hour and the hourly normals used for comparison. This method of treatment of the subject is that followed by General Sabine in his discussion of the results of the British observations.*
" In reference to methods and results in general on this subject, the following pa.pen; may be consulted : Observation· on Magnetism a.nd Meteorology, ma.de at )[akerstown in Scotland, in the Observa.tory of General Sir Thomas M. Brisbane, Bart., in 18<15 and 1846, fonning vol. xix, P"rt I, of the Trans. Roy. Society of Edinburgh: By John Allen Brown; Edinburgh, 1849.

The details of th13 method will- be better undcr:;tood by an cxf'.mple. The time of the moon's passage over the meridian of Philadelphia (upper transit) wns obtained from the American Almanac, the small correction for the difference of longitude being neglected. The observation nearest to the Jocal mean Rolar time of the moon's transit was marked with a zero, signifying Oh. of lunar time. The time of the infc1·ior trnnFit wa,; next obtained, and the observation nearest to it in time was marked 12h. The greatest difference in interval between the moon's transit and the time of observation could in 110 instance exceed half an hour. In the bi-hourly series, the observation nearest the moon'" trnnsit. or to either hour angle, one hour before or one hour after the trarrnit, was marked. The mean of a numuer of differences for the same hours will thus give lt result corresponding nearly enmlt'.h ,\-ith tl1e hour. The nurnLer of ouservations intermediate between those marked Oh. and 1271. were marked with the corresponding hour angle by interpolation, care being taken to note the nearest full hour against each observation in the bi-hourly series. The hourly series lJcgins with October 1843. In the case of thirteen obaervations within twelve lunar hours, the one 11earcst mid way between the two consccuti vc lunar Ii ours was omitted. In the month of Mardi, 1842, which is selected a" an example of the detail;;; of working the bi-hourly series, the nurnuer of observations uv;i,ilable is 2!)8, of which 148 correspond 1o western, and 150 to eastern hour angles. In the abstract which followt-l, + indicates a deviation of the norih end of the magnet to the west, and - a deviation to the east of the rcf'pective normal position for the hour. The hourly normals are given in tlrn firnt part of the discussion. No difTerence exceeds eight divi:-iions, this being the limit iu number indicated by the criterion.

One of the first questions to determine is, how many of these residuals must be used to give a definite result; and another one is, whether numbers deduced from different parts of the series would give harmonious results. To test both of these the observations were formed into three groups: one containing 4,900 in 19 months of 1840-'41; another 6,715 results in 21 months of 1842-' 43, and a third 10, 029 results in 18 months of 1844-'45: in all 21, 644 results. The following table contains the result for each group. Group II includes three months of the 110urly series of observations treated as if only equal in weight to the bi-hourly series. The sign ::s indicates the algebraic sum of the values in the preceding tables for the months comprised in each group, and for every hour angle of the moon. The lines beaded I, II, III, contain the preceding values divided by their respective number of months and expressed in minutes of arc, or the lunar-diurnal variation.

The numerical results from these eq_uations are presented graphically on Sketch No. 7. The curves all agree in their distinctive characters, and show two east and two west deflections in a lunar day; the maxima W and E occurring about the upper and lower culminations, and the minima at the intermediate six hours. The total range hardly reaches o·. 5. Tbese results agree generally with those obtained for Toronto and Prague. From 8, 000 to 10, 000 observations seem to be required to bring out the results satisfactorily, and the best results are derived from the use of all the groups. The following table contains annual sums of deflection for each hour, and the resulting lunar· diurnal variation from the 21, 644 observations available for the purpooe:

The two values for 1843, marked a and b, exhibit the separate sums for the bi-hourly and the hourly observations, and were required to give proper weight to each. There are thirtyseven months of bi-hourly and twenty-one months of hourly observations, the latter having double weight, as found from a consideration of the probable errors derived, respectively, from all the results of the years 1842 and 1844. The probable error of any single monthly mean for any hour in the year 1842 was found= ± Od.60, and the same for the year 1844 was = ± oa.40. Hence the weights for a resulting value in the bi-hourly series is to the weight for a v~lue in the hourly series nearly as 1 : 2, or nearly proportional to the number of obser· vations, a result which indicates that no undue constant errors influence the result. The acc()rdance among themselves of the values for the easterly hour angles is somewhat better than the corresponding values for the westerly hour angles, a circumstance which seems to connect with another phenomeuon to be mentioned presently. Giving, therefore, double weight to months of the hourly series, the lunar diurnal variation resulted as given above. When expressed analytically it takes the form-

where fl represents the moon's hour angle reckoned from the upper culmination, or n, the number of hours after the same epoch, +indicates west and - east deflection. 'rhe constant. in Bessel's formula comes out zero, and hence it is iuferred that the moon has

no specific action in deflecting the magnet by a constant quantity. The coefficient of the first term of the formula is small, and it is from the second term that the distinctive features of the double-crested curve result. These results are all represented by curves. Both the east and west deflections are well marked, those occurring when the moon is east of the meridian being greater than those when west. It is not at all necessary to take in the third or hip; her terms. The progression of the hourly values is systematic, and the agreement between the computed and observed values is deemed satisfactory. Diagram No. 2 of Sketch No. 7 represents the curve resulting from the above equation, the observed values being indicated by dots. The principal western maximum occurs six minutes after the lo~,er culmination of the moon, and amounts to 0'.23. The secondary maximum occurs fourteen minutes after the upper culmination, and amounts to 0'.18. The l1rincipal minimum occurs at 61'. 17m. after the lower culmination, the easterly deflection being O'. 22. The secondary minimum at 611. 03m. after the upper culmination, with a deflection of 0'.19. The greatest ran~e is 27" and the secondary 22". The epochs of the maxima and minima are found from the formula to be at a mean ten minutes after culmination. The probable error of a single computed value of the lunar declination is ± ] 11 .32. The Toronto observations gave± 1 11 .37 from more than twice the numuer of observations, so that the Philadel[Jhia results are worthy of every confidence. At Toronto, from the second investigation, embracing about 44, 000 observations, the western and eastern deflections balanced, giving for the range 38 11 · 3. The Prague observations also confirm the nearly equal deflections (mean) to the west and east. The epoch;; of the maxima and minima were found from the four rootti of the equation 0 = 0. 029 co,;. (0 295°) 0.414 cos. (2 (} + 85°,) which gave ten minutes as tbe mean time elapsed between the moon's i)assing the meridian and the time of maxima deflections. If we take the four phases into account the lunar action seems to be retarded ten minutes, which quantity may be termed the lunar-magnetic interval for the Philadelphia station. At Toronto the intervals are not so regular. The secondary range exists at Toronto, and is a marked feature in the Prague result. The following table contains the observed and computed values and their differences:

The formula or curve enables us to divide the obBerved values so as to sho,,7 the diurnal and semi-diurnal part of the observed variations. The decomposition of the curve is made on the diagram where the resulting curves for the diurnal and semi-diurnal periods are given. The lunar-diurnal variation seems to be subject to an inequalit,r, depending on the solar year, for the investigation of which the preceding results were rearranged in two groups: one containing the hourly values for the summer months, (April to September,) the other the values for .the winter months, (October to March.) For the summer season we have 11, 087 obser· vations, and for the winter 10, 557.

Expressed analytically, the lunar diurnal variation in the two seasons is as follows: In summer, .6 = - 0'.006 0'.028 sin. (8 18°) 0'.278 (2 () 67°.)
(

In winter, L'.l

<

+ + + + = + 0'.005 + 0'.058 sin. (fJ + 264°) + 0'.173 (2 0 + 115°.)

The characteristic feature of the annual inequality in the lunar-diurnal variation is therefore a much smaller amplitude in winter than in summer. Kreil, indeed, inferred from the ten-year series of the Prague observations that in winter the lunar-diurnal variation either disappears or is entirely concealed by irregular fluctuations, requiring a long series for their elimination. Tbe method of reduction which he employed was, howev\'r, less perfect than that now used. The second characteristic of the inequality consists in the earlier occurrence of the maxima and mini.ma in winter than in summer. The winter curve precedes the summer curve by about one and three quarter hours. Both these features are well expressed in the diagram

No. 7. At Toront.o the same shifting in the maxima antl minima epochs was noticed, but tbe other inequality in the amonnt of deflection is uot exhibited. It seem;;; probaLio that the Philadelphia results are more typical in form than thof;e either of Prn~lw or Toronto. It is also apparent that the smaller deflection at the upper c11lmirn1tion iu the annual rnmm, when compared with the deflection at the lower culmination, i:< entire!,\· produced l,:· the fet:ble lunar action in winter. The maximum west deflp,ction in 1;urnmer occurs aduall\· uear the upper culmination. At the same season the maximum east lleflection is 1'till retained (:1s in the mmnal curve) about Rix hours after the lo,,·er culmination. ln the winter o;ea;.;011 thi,.; last-mentioned maximum east deflection is actually the smaller of the two. \.Ye ha.-e-Maximum summer range. · .. · . · · · · · · · · 35". 4, secondary. · .... 31". s Maximum winter range .. · .. · · · · · · · · · · 25".2 .... do.·.· ..

At Prague the maximum summer range \,·as 44". Next I proceed to examine whether the phases of the mo011, the declination or parallax, have any sensible effect upon the magnetic declination. l\lr. Krcil found, from a ten year;;' series of observations at Prague, that there "·as no Sj)ecific change in the position of tlie magnet depending upon the moon' B phase,; and parallax, but that the declination 'ms G''. 8 greater when the moon was at tbe greatest northern declination than when at tlte greatest ;;outliern declination. On tho contrary, l\Ir. Brown, from the Makerstown ob:<erYation::<, a much :sl1oder series than the one at Prague, inferred tlmt there \nu~ a maximum of declination two days after the full moon. He also found a maximum corresponding to the gnoatest. northern uecliuation of the moon, but does not appear to have inve;.;tigatecl the effect of di,,tanee. The residuals which we have been treating enable us at once to examine thesA st,Yeral poiuis. Beginning with the lunar phases, the daily means for the day of full and new moon anil for two succeeding days were compared ·with the monthly moan dl-clination. ln case any of the hours were disturbed, tho moi1thly normal for tho hour was sub:;tituted for tlJe disturbed ohtiervation before the mean was taken. If one-half, or more, of the hourly readings were disturbed, the daily mean was altogether omitted. Accidental omissions of lwud.Y observatimrn wore supplied by the hourly normal. The ha.lf-mrmthly normals were abo usou in tho cornpari,,;on. In the table of differences thns formed, equal weight is given to tl1e bi-hourly aud hourly observations. The daily mean having hee11 subtracted from the month, the positive sign indicates a western deflectiou, au<l the negative sign an eastern one, as compared with the normal posit.ion.

These results do not positively fix a deflection of the magnet as depending on the moon's greatest north and south declination, the amount resulting from the comparisons being of nearly the same magnitude as its probable error.

The differences being of the same order of magnitude as the probable errors, no conclusion as to the effect of distance can be drawn from them. I propose hereafter to extend the discussion of the moon's effect on the declination to the effect on the earth's magnetic force.

simultaneously and independently in 1852 by Sabine, Gautier, and Wolf,* principally from the magnetic results of Lamont and the solar spot observation" of 8chwabe, made it desiraLle that observations of the solar spots should be made in co-operation with the magnetic obHervations now in progreRs at the stations Key West, Florida, a!ld EastpOl't, Maille. As an illui;tration of the above connection, Part I of the discussion of the magnetic observations at Girard College, Philadelphia, in 1840 to 1845, t may be referred to. In that paper the relation subsisting between the frequency of the solar RpotR and the law of the di:;tluliauces and the changes in the amplitude of the solar diurnal variation of the magnetic declination is fully diiscmised. In accordance with your instructions, I commenced daily observations for freqnenr-.'- and position of the solar spots on January 1, 1860, at one of the Coao;t Survey ofiice buildi11gs, in latitude 38° 53' 0411 .2, longitude 77° 00' 10". 7, west of Greenwich. The observations for position were made, as weather pe1·mitted, in the manner described by Mr. Carrington, aJl(l explained in the monthly notices of the Astronomical Society.:;: The ouservations were made with an equatorially mounted Fraunhofer and Utzschneider telesC'ope of four feet focal length, having an object glass three inches in diameter. The magnifying power used was 55. The image of the sun was received on a screen, of a light neutral bluish tint, attached to the inside of a box fastened to tLe eye end of the telescope, and open on one side. The projected image was nearly five inches in diameter. To identify the spots from day to d<iy a sketch was traced by the eye by slipping a sheet of paper over tl1e screen, a more elaborate drawing being made afterwards of all the morn remarkable spots (and facuhe) with the higher magniiYing power of about 175. The contacts and transits of the spots oYer the wires were noted with the mean time chronometer, "Kessel's, No. 1287." In these observations I was assisted by Mr. J. H. Patton. The computations for hcliographic latitude and longitude of the spot;; are in progress. In the present report I give (as a first result) a table of the relative frequency of the solar spots for the first seven months of the present year. The sketches generally \YCre made between one and two o'clock p. m., ·w ashington mean time. The principal solar spot period discovered by Prof. R. Wolf, and fixed by him at 11.11 years, (with a mean error which may be estimated according to )litth. IX at ± 0.3 yearti,) is plainly exhibited by means of a proper system of enumeration known as \Y olf' s relative numbers of the frequency of the solar t'pots. A large masR of obscrYations have been carefully registered in accordance witl1 this enumeration; and lately§ :Mr. Carrington prepared a map on which the maxima and minima of the frequency of the soh1r spots between the years 1740 m1d 1860 'vere laid down; the ordinates being projected throughout by the relative numbers of Prof. Wolf. The nature of these numbers may be briefly explained, as follows :ii 'l'Le acti.-ity of the sun in producing solar spots being directly proportional to the number and area of the groups and single spots may be expressed by a= mg+ ns; where g =number of g-rnup;;:, 8 =number of spots, and rn and n co-efficients or relative weightis. .Accordillg to Prof. Wolfs investigation, m = 10, n 1, or a= 10 g s. Hence we obtain the relative numbers by adding the number of single spots (those forming groups as well as thoRe of au isolated character) to ten times the number of groups. The only difficulty in this enumeration lies in the definition of a group or assemblage of spots apparently connected; lmt o"·ing to the circun:::;tance that

there is a strong tendency to the formation of groups, any two observers, after acquiring the necessary experience, will probably not materially differ in their average numbers. The final numliers ·will require a multiplier depending on the power of the telescope used. In the present case this factor must be near unity, since the magnifying power does not differ much from that used by Sch wabc and Wolf.

Report on tlie magneti'c stati'on at Key West, Flori'da reef, by Prof. W. P. Trowbridge, .Assistant Coast Survey. (Sketches Nos. 23 and 24.)
UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, Ma.y 1, 1860.
DEAR 8m: I h:we the honor to present the folluwing account of the establishment of the magnetic «tation at Key West, Florida, to which duty I was assigned by your instructions of December lai>t.

THE UNITED ST.ATES COAST SCRVEY.

The instruments intended for the observatory were sent to Norfolk in charge of the observer, Mr. Samuel Walker, OH December 13, 1859, pDcked in twelve boxes. At Norfolk they were shipped on board the Coast Survey steamer \Yalker, liound to the Gulf of :Mexico, and were safely landed at Key ·west on January 10, 1 SGO. I arrived at Key ""\Ve:;;t on the 8th of January, and was therefore ready to receiYe the instruments, for which I procured temponny storage in Fort Taylor, through the kiudnesi,; of Capt. E. B. Hunt, U. S. Engineers, in charge of the fort. I was much i1idebteu to Lieut. Comg. Guthrie, of the Walker, and Lieut. Comg. \Vilkinson, of the Corwin, for t11eir kinunoss in transporting the materials and instruments safely to Key West, and in landing tl1crn for ill\l in their boats at Fort Taylor. Two temporary buildings belonging to the fort had beeu offered for our use by the Engineer department, and t1ie first step to be taken \Vas to examine these lmilding·s to ascertai11 whether either would an;;;wer the desired purpose. That which appeared most promising was an old magazine, built originally in a very sulistantial ma1mer, and entirely free from irnn, all the fastenings being of copper. After a very thorough stndy of tbe plan of the required observatory, and a close examination and measurement of thi,; magazine, it "·as found to be entirely too small, being not only deficient in the ground plan, but al:so in height. It was moreover, insecure, the lower timbern having been almost destroy eel by dry-rot. The other building was merely a large shed, built for a cement shed. This Luiluiug pre:oenteu a dear ground area of 60 feet by 21 feet, with a height of 10 feet to the pitch of the roof. It Wail weH roofed and weather-boarded, with double folding-doors at the ends. As the locality seemed faYorable, I decided to make use of this shed as an outer covering and protection, and to construct a close room within it for the instruments, leaving a clear space between the walls of the two for the circulation of air. By allowing a free circulation, and at the same time having the interior room protected from the direct rays of the sun, the necessary conditions for steadiness of temperature would be obtained, though the -,valls were not thick. This arrangement allowed several feet of air space between the roofs of the inner and the outer bnildingi'. The building having been decided up0n, observations were made to determine the bearings of the sides with rderence to the magnetic meridian, the rernlt of which \ms that the longest walls, which were north and south, ·were one foot four inches out of the magnetic meridian in their whole length of 59 foet. This permitted the placing of the piers within the inner building according to the plan adopted. Detailed drawings were then made showing the positions and dimensious of the piers, from which their positions were laid off carefully on the ground. Excavations were then made down to the solid rock, and after the positions of the piers had been verified by additional observations for the magnetic meridian, they were built up with bricks and hydraulie cement in the most substantial manner. The height of each pier -was determined before the lower course was laid, so 'that the workmen might bring them up with even courses, and without cutting the bricks. Earth was then thrown around the bases of the piers, filling up the excavations, and the ground prepared for the floor timbers. The interior room was laid out according to a plan already prepared. The dimensions are 17 feet by 31 feet.; ten feet of the south end being partitioned off for the operating room. The room was made of such a size that no instrument would be nearer thau 18 inches to the wall, thus allowing the obsm·ver to pass around the piers without knocking against them. The floor, sides, and ceiling were made of tongued and grooved pine boards, planed on the inner side and fastened with zinc nails. .A. very close, clean room was thus formed, by which the instruments as well as the paper and chemicals arc protected from current,:: ot' air or dust. The strength of the construction is such that walkillg about produce::; no sensible vibration in the building. The piers are of course not connected with the floor, a space of half an inch . being left around each pier. The instruments placed in the instrument room (Sketch No. 23) for the continuous record of

the magnetic variations are the following, viz: The Declinorneter, the Horizontal Forc,e JJiag· nelomcter, the Vertt"cal Force Magnetometer, one Clock and Re_cording Apparatus, for the first two instruments, and one Cwck and Recording Appa1·atus for the \-ertical force instruments. There are also three tripods for supporting the lamps, one in front of each magnet. These instruments may be described as follows : The Declinomcter consists essentially of a tripod stand from which a flat bar magnet is suspended by a silk suspension thread. The tripod is composed of a black marble base 16 X 19{- inches, and I:} inches thick. Six legs formed of brass tubes about three-quarters of an inch in diameter screwed to bolts passitig through the corners of the sfab, a heavy circular plate to which the legs are screwed at top; a torsion plate resting upon this, which carries a suspension hook and elevating screw, the suspension skein, and the magnet and its attachments. The torsion plate carries a vernier, and the plate upon which it rests is graduated to read, with the vernier, to half minutes. The suspending skein is formed of thirty single fibres of raw silk, which were originally stretched by equal ·weights to each fibre, and then bound together while stretched, at intervals of a few inches. The aggregate of the weigbts being equal to tlie weight of the magnet and attachments. The maximum strength and rniuimum tor:;ion are thus secured, while the skein has a large surplus strength over the breaking weigbt. The magnet and attachments comprise all that is suspended by the skein. The magnet is inserted between two small plates with screws passing through the corners of the plates by which the magnet is clamped in its place. A hook is attached to the centre of the upper pLtte which hooks into the loop at the end of the skein. To the lower plate is attached a light brass frame which sustains a 0ircular reflector, 2~ inches in diameter, in a vertical position below the magnet; the distance from the centre of the reflector to the central line of the magnet being 2.} inches. The reflector is concave, having a focal Jcngth of 8 feet 6 inches. Below the speculum, and attached to the same frame, is a small rectangular mirror of plane glass, fixed in vertical position by screws. The large mirror reflectR the light of the lamp to the photographic register, and the small mirror reflects the scale of a fixed reading telescope (placed in any part of the room) by means of which the direction of the magnet may always be referred to a fixed line. The pier upon which tl1is instrument rests is 3 feet 6ft inches above the floor and 20 inches square in hori:.mntal section. 'l'hc lamp which properly forms a part of the Declinometer apparatus rests upon a tripod at a distance of about 2 feet from the centre of the speculum, and near the line joining the speculum and the mean position of the trace on the recording cylinder; the tripod stands upon a pier which rises one foot from the floor. The light from the lamp passes through a narrow slit in an upright strip of metal, and, falling upon the speculum, is reflected to the recording cylinder. A dark shade stops all the light of the lamp except that which passes through the slit. The horizontal force magnet is supported on a pier near the corner of the room, diagonally opposite to the declinometer. The marbk slab for the base of the tripod, the tripod, the torsion circle, and the elevating screw, correspond to the similar parts of the declinometer. In both instruments the suspension skeins are protected by glass tubes, through which the skeins pass, and the magnets and attachments are protected by glass cases resting upon the marble slabs; so that when the magnets are finally adjusted they are not deranged by currents of air or dust. A small glass case is placed upon the top of each instrument, fitting closely to the plate, for the same purpose. The only essential difference in the construction of the two instruments is the double or bifilar suspension skein of the horizontal force apparatus and its temperature·eompensating apparatus. The silk suspension skein is made like that of the declinometer, but the magnet is suspended by passing the skein over a glass roller attached to the elevating screw, the two ends falling down through the glass tube to the small suspension lJOoks of the magnet and its attachments. The magnet has nearly the same dimensions as the

THE UNITED ST.ATES COAST SURVEY.

declinometer magnet, and the mirrors are attached in the same manner, having the same office to fulfil. The temperature compensating attachment of thi;; magnet is fixed to the upper plate, which bolds the magnet in its place. This compensating apparatus consists of the following arrangements, viz: A small glass rod, aLout ten ind1es in length, is clamped at its middle point to the top plate of the two, between which the magnet is damped, and in the direction of the magnet; two separate zinc tubes, each about half the le11gth of the rod, are then i;.lid over the ends of the glass rod, the rod being kept in the middle of tl1c tubes li~· interior rollcni. The tubes may be clamped to the rod at the ends furthest from the centre of the magnet, or at the end nearest the centre. The loops of the suspom;ion thread are lwoked to the ends of the zinc tubes, near the middle of the glass rod. The temperature compensation is ctfo<.'ted hy clamping the zinc tubes to tlrn glass rod at the extreme en1l thus allowing the tube.~ to expand towards the centre, while the cxpansion of the glass rod is from the centre. The magnet being adjust.eel in its position perpendicular to the meridian by mcans of the torsion, if we suppose the temperature to rise, the force of the magnet becomes lee>', and the torsion force preponderates; the ends of the glnss rod,; expanding outwards at the same time, the lower interval of the threads is increased, and i.he torsion force thus increased; but the expansion of the zinc being in the opposite direction, and being greater than thnt of the glass, the lower interval iR, in fact, lessened; so tlmt the same cause which tend:> to weaken the force of the magnet weakens also the torsion force, and the equilibrium of the two forces remains unaffected by this cause. The p1·oper adjustment of this compensation is a very difficult matter, and, as will be seen subsequently, the attempt to adjust it at Key West was abandoned and the zinc tubes were clamped at the centre. The temperature corrections are, therefore, to be made as in other instrument;;.. The lamp, lamp stand, and its pier, are constructed in the ,;ame manner as those of the declinorneter, and similarly placed. As the record of the instruments just described are made on the opposite ends of the same .cylinder, the lamps are on opposite sides of the line joining the centres of the mirrors of the two instruments. The recording cylinder and clock for these instruments is placerl near tl1e middle of the room upon a brick pier, ·which rests upon the solid rock helow. The object of this dock is to give motion to tbe cylinder around which the photographic iiaper iR wrapped to receive iIBpressions from the light from the lamps. The clock is a Rnbstantial pendulum clock, similar io th9se used for the self-registering tide gauge. Upright supports are fixed to the base board of the clock, upon which the cylinder axles rest. To the cylinder (a hollow drum with brass plates for the ends) motion is communicated by means of wheel-work, at the rate of one revolution in twenty. four hours. The clock not only serves to give motion to the cylinder, but giveil the means .of recording the time in connection with the record of the magnetic variations. The cylinder is 8~ inches in diameter, and 13 inches in length. The pier on which this apparatus stands is of such a length as to allow the pendulum to swing clear of the floor by three inches; and as the central line of the cylinder must necessarily be in the same horizontal Jilane with the centres of the two mirrors of the magnets, the height of thi8 pier above the floor was first determined, taking into account the length of the pendulum, the thickness of the.base board of the clock, and the height of the centre of the cylinder rtbovo that hoard, and the magnet and lamp pier re~ulated accordingly. The height of tbe brick-work of the pier is three feet five inches. This pier supports, besides the clock and cylinder, the cylindrical lenses for bringing the light of the lamps to a focus upon the surface of the cylinder. These lenses, one for each magnet, on opposite sides of the cylinde1·, are each composed of two plain convex. lenses, twelve inches in length, the outer having a focal length of two and a half inches, the lenses being fixed in a wooden frame about eight-tenths of an inch apart, and tho combinatinn having a focal distance of about half of an inch. 'l'he lenses are supported on wooden feet, so that the central lines of the lenses shall rest in the horizontal plane of the axis of the

cylinder. Thus, when the instruments are adjusted, the magnets, mirrors, and the lenses on each Ride, form a combination by which the ligl1t of each lamp, reflected from its mirror, is brought to a focus at a point upon the surface of the cylinder, in whatever direction the magnet may point within the limits of the ordinary variations. The declinometer and bifilar magnets are about 19 feet 5 inches apart, the recording cylinder being nearly the same distance from each. The exact measurements are given in another part of this report. The central clock pier supports also the fixed telescopes and scales to be employed as checks upon the photographic registers. For the purpose of obtaining perfectly fixed supports for these telescopes the central pier was corbelled out on two sides, beyond the dimension&i required for the clock and cylinder, and tbe telescopes firmly fastened upon these corbels. The vertical force magnetometer is placed near the NW. corner of the room, about twelve feet from the lwrizontal force magnet. This instrument consists, essentially, of a bar magnet, of uearly the same kugth and breadth as the other two magnets; the attachments of the magnets, (viz: the frame and mirrors,) the marble base. and supports for resting the magnet frame upon agate plane;,;. While the deelinometer and horizontal force magnets are suspended by torsion skeins of silk, and move in horizontal planes, the vertical force magnet vibrates in a vertical plane upon a horizontal axis. The frame is provided with agate knife edges which rest Dn agate planes, and the magnet is balanced in such a manner as to vibrate under the influence of the vertical component of the magnetic force. The centre of the speculum is nearly in the axis of rotatiou, while the small mirror for the fixed telescope is above the axis. Both arc attached to the frame by clamp-screw;;, as in tlie other in&itruments. The lamp and its stand correspond to those of the other instruments, and are placed at the same distance, nearly, from the magnet. Tlrn clock and cyliuder for the photographic record of this im1trument arc placed in a line perpendicular to the magnetic meridian from the magnet, and at about nine J'eet two inches from it. This places the clock near the horizontal force magnet pier, though it has no connection with it. The cylinder is vertical and revolves under the influence of the clock-work once in twenty-four hours. The lens for concentrating the rays is, of course, vertical. The magnet, lamp, and clock are placed on Rcparate piers. The reading telescope is placed on the clock pier. ?'ho vertical force magnet is protected from currents of air, dust, &c., by a close box with glazed openings for the light of the lamp to pass through to and from the mirrors. The:se comprise all the instruments employed for the continuous record of the magnetic variations. The foregoing description is only intended to be general in its character, as a more detailed description of the instruments can only be given with the aid of drawings; but I have presumed that a brief general description would not be ont of place in this report, though the construction and use of the instruments are known to those who take a special interest in the subject. Before mounting the instruments the room was thoroughly cleaned and dusted and the piers yellow-washed. . The declinometer and horizontal force magnetometer were .first unpaeked and placed, approximately, in their respective positions. 'l'he central clock and cylinder were then placed in position and the three instruments adjusted, approximately, fo their respective heights, so that the axis of the cylinder, and the centres of the large mirrors of the magnets, should rest in the same horizontal plane. As the magnets, when finally adjusted, are enclosed in rect· angular glass cases it is import.ant that the faces of f,he glass through whic~'the:tight passes should be perpendicular to the rays, this requires the adjustment of the mat·ble baSes with reference to the magnetic meridian; which was accomplished by marking point&on the waits in the magnetic meridian and stretching a line thread between these points, by which the slabs were set in their proper directions. The ome method was taken· to determine, .ii1tally1 the

relatiye positions of the magnets hefore securing the slabs to the piers, it having been determined to place the declinometer and horizontal force magnets so that the line adjoining their centres f'houlrl make an angle of 35° 16' with the magnetic meridian. The pier::; were found to be of the proper relative heights and the marble slabs were then laid in cement and perfectly levelled before the cement had time to set. The central clock was secured to its pier by large screws let into a henvy square block which was set with the mortar in the top course of masonry. The lamps were set and adjusted in the same horizontal plane with the ceutres of the mirrors and the axis of the recording cylinder. The lamp stands were not fastened to their piers until a final adjustment of the focal distance could be made. The vertical force instrument was then unpacked and mounted, the marble b1cise being firmly set in cement, and great care being taken to place the magnet in a position perpendicular to the magnetic meridian. This wa,; accomplished hy stretching a fine thread in the magnetic meridian and adjusting the line of knife edges to this thread. Especial attention was paid to levelling this instrument also. The clock and cylinder apparatus for the vertical force instrument was then placed upon the pier destined for it, levelled, and permaneutly secured by heavy Lrass screws. T~1e frames holding the lenses for this cylinder, as well as those for the other instruments, were secured to the base boards by stops, in such a way as to permit of their being easily adjusted or removed, and secure from accident. 'l'he reading telescopes of the declinometer and horizontal force magnets were placed on corbels run out on opposite sides of the central pier, and firmly secured by woodeu clamps. The telescope for the vertical force mag1Jet was placed on its clock pier, one course of brick being carried up a few inche8 to give it the proper height. Additional strength aud firmness was given to this projection by strips of boards nailed to the pier, a11d the tele,;cope fastened to a cross strip by screws. The reading telescopes were thus fixed as permanently as the piers. and all the instruments being thus placed upon solid masonry, disconnected with the building, and resting upon solid rock, permanence and stability were secured. Very little wood-work was attached to the masonry, and wherever it was necessary thecbest seaeoned pine was used. The instruments were all thoroughly cleaned before being mounted. AdJustments.-The adjustment of the declinometer first engaged my attention. The adjustment of this instrument consists, first, in bringing the line of no torsion to coincide with the mean magnetic meridian; second, the adjustment of the speculum in azimuth and vnticaJly, so that when the magnet is at rest the light from the lamp will be reflected to the required point on the surface of the recording cylinder, when the lamp is fixed in its proper position; third, the adjustment of the small mirror in azimuth, and the reading telescope in height, HO that the scale at£ached to the telescope can be read plainly through the telescope; fourth, the' adjustment of the cylindrical lens, to bring the rays to a focus on the i::urface of the cylinder. The first adjustment is made in the usual manner, by suspeudiug a Iearfon bar, of the same weight as the magnet, in the magnet frame, and adjusting the line of detorsion by succesRive trials. The second adjustment is combined with the adjustment of the lamp. The latter is first placed so that the angle of the incident and reflected rays shall be as small as possible, and at such a focal distance from the speculum that the rays will be brought to a focus in the focus of the cylindricallens. The manner in which the speculum is supported renders this a difficult adjustment; it is moved in its frame by clamp and tangent screws, which in the instrument employed are not well adapted to the purposei and it was only by patient and long-continued trials that the adjustment could be made. And when to this adjustment is added the third, which UUl&t be simultaneous with it, the whole operation became very perplexing and tedious;

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF
espe~ially when it is necessary that the final touch of the screws must leave the mirror and magnet firmly and permanently clumped in their plnce;;;, and when the slightest excess of motion throws them out of place. The instruments in this respect might be greatly improved. 'l'lie adjustment of the lenses is not difficult. The frame lwlding them should be placed at such a distance from the cylinder as to bring the light to a well-defined focus upon the surface and in the plane of the axis. The only Rource of uncertainty in a long- continued series of observations with the de clinometer is the possible change of the magnetic axis of the mag·net, with the permanent loi;s of magne-tism which gradually takes place. "\Vith a mounting adapted to a reversal of the magnet, the magnetic axis might be determined from time to time. Adjustment qf the lwrizonlalforcc magnct.-The adjustments of this instrument are the following, Yiz: 1st. To place the magnet, by means of the bifilar torsion suspension, perpendicnlnr to the magnetic meridian. 2d. To adjust the mirrors so that the reflected· rays from tho lamp and telescope scale shall fall respectively on the surface of the recording cylinder and the reading telescope when the magnet is in its position, perpendicular to the magnetic meridian. 3d. The adjustment of the focal distances of the lump and the cylindrical lens. 4th. The adjustment of the temperature compensating apparatus by artificial changes of temperature of the magnet and its attachments. The first adjustment was made by stretching two fine threads across the room, directly over the suspended magnet, in the direction of and perpendicular to the magnetic meridian. The magnet frame \vas suRpended first, with a lead bar in place of the magnet, and the line of no torsion was Adjusted to each of these t1ueads in succe;;sion, and the readings of the torsion taken, showing a difference of 90°. The magnet 1rns then inserted with marked end east, and the torsion circle turned in azimuth until the direction of the magnet coincided with the line perpendicular to the magnetic meridian, the lower intervnl of the threads being determined, so that the torsion angle should be large enough to render the torsion force sensitive, and yet without rendering the equilibrium between the torsion and magnetic forces unstable. The magnet was then reversed, and the same determinations made with marked end west, and a mean of the reimlt tuken. The same determinations were made with the marked end west. 'The adjmitments of the mirrors aud lamps correspond to the same adjustments in the declinometer, the l:'ame <lif1lcultics, except in a greater degree, being experienced from t4!3 mode of attaching the magnet and mirrors to the suspension frame. The sui;pension skei~ was well stretched before the final adjustments were made. The adjustment of the temperature-compensating apparatus of Mr. Brooke was found to be impossible under the large horizontal force at Key West. This compensation depends upon the horizontal component of the magnet force of the earth, the magnetic moment of the magnet, the weight of the mag·net and its attachments, the upper and lower intervals of the threads, the length of the threads, and the angle of torsion, and is determined experimentally, with the aid of the following formulre : ·

m. X= W.

~-sin 0.

By the arrangement proposed and described in the foregoing pages, b, the lower interval of the threads, is made to change with m, so that the two members of the equation remain equal
under changes of temperature. The value of X, for London, employed by Mr. Brooke 'vas X 3, 8, and tho value of ab and b were made to correspond, (m) (W.) and sin{} being supposed :to be constant. Whe~ it became necessary to put up the instruments at Key West, where -the value oi X is nel\rly double that for London, {6, 8,) it was found that -the value of neither of the quantities ab, b, sin 8, or W, could be changed sufficiently without 3 new ronstruction of the instroment. This conclusion was confirmed by the first attempt at comparison by artificial cbange-0f temperature.

In the hope of overcoming the difficulty I had an auxiliary roller made of the same dimensions as the suspension roller, to be placed a few inches below the latter, as a spreader; the effect of which would be the same as increasing a as far as the compensation was effected, while the principles and sensitiveness of the torsion lmlance would remain unchanged. This expedient was tried, and succeeded so far that, by raising aud lowering the auxiliary roller, two points were found, at one of which the instrument was over-cumperrnated, and at the other undercompensated; but a new difficulty occurred, which could not lie overcome. This was the impossibility of heating and cooling the apparatus with the means at command in such a manner as to make the experiment for a perfect compensation reliable. The a4uoi<phere at Key West is so highly charged with moisture that, when the magnet wa;; cooled much below 61°, there was a copious deposit of dew upon the magnet and its attachments, which, by increasing the weight, rendered the result uncertain; and again, on heating,· the moisture was evaporated, producing a similar effect. From a series of experiments, the results of which are given in the appendix to this. report, I found the desired compensation quite impracticable, and was obliged to go back to the old method of observing the temperature of the magnet, and providing for a temperature connection. The small coefficients of the magnets, and the steadiness of the temperature at. Key West, will make the temperative connections very small for the daily changes. The temperature coefficient of the horizontal force magnet, as determined by Mr. BrJoke, is 0.000507 .00000243, and for the vertical force magnet 0.0000757 + 0.000000345. By my own determinations it is somewhat larger, as will be seen from ID}' determinations. The mean daily range of the temperature at Key West, for each month, (from the Army Meteorological Register,) for 185 l and 1852, is given below; also the mean monthly range, for each month, for four years, and the mean temperature for each month for fourteen years. From these reconls it will be seen that the climate of Key West is remarkable for regularity and steadiness of temperature-especially favorable for magnetic 'observations, in presenting a very small daily range of the thermometer, seldom greater than 5° Fahrenheit, and the monthly variations recurring with remarkable coincidence in tLe different years.

The udjustment of t~e vertical force magnet consists, first, iu placing the magnet. perpendicular to the mag-uetic meridian; second, adjusting the mirror and damp as in the other instruments; third, balancing the magnet on the agate planes so t!tat it sha11 be snfficifmtly sensitive under the influence of tbe Yertical action of the magnetic force without being in a position of absolute unstal_1le equilibrium. The first adjustment j,_ a permaneut one, and mn,;t be made in setting the marble base. The mirrors are adjn,;ted ,,-itl1ont difficulty, as the n10tion is upon the fixed solid a~is to which the mirrors are attached. The third is not attended with ditlicnlty, as the nrnre delicate adjnstment of the Lalam:e is accomplished by small counterpoise weights at the ends of the projecting rods, the weights Leiog moveal·lc upon the roJ,;; h.'- fi11e screw th1·cads. In order to mafrn the balance sufficienrly t'ensitivu, however, it is nece.ssary to Lring it very near to tl10 position of unstable equilihrium, and as it is impossible for tho in,;trument to have the sensitiveness of the tornion l1alance, another adjustment is provided for in the instrument put up at Key \Ve~t, devised by Mr. Brooke, to cornpeirnate for tlie effect of changes of temperature. Tbis is a small thermometer, co11sfructed "·ith g-reat care and 1'kill, to be clamped near its centre of gravity to the axis of motiou. Tlw co11struction is intended to lie f'uch that when the magnet is balanced between the opposing forces of g-rnvity and the Yertical mag·netic force, a clrnug-e of temperature will cau>le the mercury in the stern to expaud or contract, just en~ugh to overcome the loss or increase of the force of the magnet caused by tl1e same change of temperature, A ri,;e of temperature, for in,,tance, diminishes the magnetic force uf the magnet, and the balance i,; disturbed wl1ile the earth's magnetic force may not have clmngeJ. The thermometer restores the equilibrium by the expansion of the mercury throwing a little more 1Yeight to one side. I am inclined to believe, however, that this compensation is entirely too delicate for the instrument, aud that the only reliable way to obtain good results with the balanced magnetometer is to secure it, a;;; completely as possible, from changes of tempernture; any considerable change of temperature muBt affect the balance by the contraction or expau· eion of the frame and counterpoise rods. A.ti will be seen in the account of experiments on this instrument, given in the appendix to this. report, the same difficulty occurred from the deposit of moiHture upon the magnet as in the case of the horizontal force magnet. Although different modes of heating were adopted, all atternpfa to. adjust the automatic compensator failed, and any great change of temperature, either way, threw the irn;truments entirely out of·balance. I therefore took every precaution to prel'erve a steady temperature in the magnet, by wrapping a blanket around the box enclosing it, in addition to the other considerations favorable to thil'l object. A thermometer was placed in the box, to be read through the glazed aperture, for the purpose of recording the temperature. · The in;;truments .mounted at Key ·west are those designed by Mr. Charles Brooke, of Lond011, and forwarded to this country in 1852. They had previously been mounted at the Magnetic Ob11crvatory in the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution. The only .iinportant alteration in the original design is the substitution of pendulum clock movements instead of the chronometers employed by Mr. Brooke, and the use of a single wooden cylinder for the record of both the dcclinometer and bifilar maguets. In Mr. Brooke's arrangement a cylinder and >'eparate sheet for each. instrument were employed.

was first set up to memmre the distance from the centre of the large mirror of the hifilar magnet to tbe surface of the cylinder on which the photographic trace was to be made. The details of irn:mmrement. are given in another part of the report. 'l'he whole distance was found to lie !I / 0"/0 feet, and Hie length of the scale corre:o;por1din1!: to one minute of arc 0. 0663 inches. In tlie same manner the dist.anc:e from the fac:e of the ;:.1rn1ll mirrnr to the centre division of the telescope scale was found to be ~J 1 ''d\l\i foet, and the length of one minute 0.0Gfi.3 incheR. For the declinometcr the distaricc from centre of hll'ge mirror to position of trnce on the cylinder was ~l/ 0\1'0 feet, and tlie length of one minute determined therefron1 0. OG57 inches . .From the small mirror to telescopic S<:ale the distance WEIS found to lw 9 1"c/o"o feet, and the le11gth of one <livision 0. OGi'i l inches. The corresponding distarn~es and values of the balanced magnetometer were !.l /./'090 and f)-/ 06 0 feet, and 0. OG4-7, 0. OG8 l inches. Scales were con· structed upon strong paper to correspond to tbc;;;e determinations. The three telescope scales wern fixed upon firm horizontal bars directly over the telescope, and the reg·ister scales were reserved fur the reading of the photographic traces. For the reduction o!' the records of the horizonbtl and vertical force magnets, as the angular motion depend!i not onl:· upon variatious of tlw earth',; mag-netic force, but also upon the mag· netic moments of the magnets, it become:< ueces;;ary to determine the constant coefficient for the reduction fur each instrument. For the horizontal force magnet the constant is deter· mined by the expression, t:,. F - p - cot. V. t:,. V.

t

Y being the angle of torsion, a1H1 t:,. Y deuoting the variations of Yin terms of radius. Fur the vertical force magnet thi,.; coeflicient is determined by the expression, 6 Y Th . :'pace on paper, . 1·p X ·- --- 2-Jl·--·y - Tv cot. c

in which V represents the vertical force, Th the time of vibration of the magnet in n, hori· zoutal plane, Tv the time of vibration in a vertical plane, the vibration being made in_ each <:a:-;e with the magnet and its attachments complete, so that the moment of inertia shall be the same. Detailed observations for olJtaiuing these coclficients are appended. The vibration of the vertical force mag11et in a horizontal plaue was made by ,;uspeuding the magnet by means of a spare 1:<u,;pe11,;ion skein, six feet in leugth. Thi:-; skein wa8 suspended from the ceiling of the room, aud the line of detornion made to coincide with the magnetic meridian by means of a leaden bar. The room was kept closed to avoid currents of air, and the magnet and attachments suspended in a horizontal position by a small wire hook made for the purpose; the magnet waR then made to vibrate in a small arc, and the times of vibration noted by observing the passage of a, reflected beam from the mirror acrosfl a line on the opposite wall. Several hundred vi bra· tions were obsen·ed, and the time noted by a chronometer. The vibrations in a vertical plane were made with the magnet in its position on the knifo edges, the time being observed by noting the passage of a certain division across the horizontal wire of the telescope. The angular value of the telescope Reale of the vertical force magnet requires a correction for the ol1liquity of the small mirror to the axiR of rotation. This mirror could not be placed with it;, plane parallel to the axis of rotation, and consequently the angular motion of the mirror is less than the angular motion of the magnet, in the proportion of unity to the cosine of the inclination. The inclination was measured very carefully by stretching a fine thread in the direction of the axis of motion, and a second in the direction of the face of the mirror, across the 1ux enclt1sing the magnet, thus forming a right-angle triangle with the threads and a part of ono side of the box. The ba;,:e of the triangle was 12 1 " 030 inches, and the altitude O. f"0 90 inch, from which the angle at the base was cletermined. · Another mode for determining the value of the scale of the bifilar magnet in terms of the

Ao: l1efore explained, the light from the 1amp;; is reflected from the mirrors attached to the :.:n><pen(fod map:uets, alld falls upon the surface of the cylinders around which tl1l' p:1per 1 rendered <'C'no;itive by tlit· application of iodide of silver, is wrn11ped; and the cylimkr 11rnki11p; one re\'ulution in ~+ l101ut', the varintions of the magnet are traced by the action of the light in a curve upon the' papc'r. Tli(' central cylinder produce" two traces-one for the dr'c·li11onwtt>r, near one eml of tlic <'yli11dL'r, and the other for the horizontal force magnet, on t.lie otlier end, aml m1 1lte tlpposite si.Je. 'fhe trace of the vertical force m~1gnct i;-; mat1e 011 a "ep<irate t'~-Iinder. a;:. before dt·scril1ed. This arrangement requires the use of two prepared sheds each dn:·-cm0 thirtePn i1wh<·s ·wide and over two feet in length, an<l the other lrnlf the width and th(' ;.:anw k11gtl1.

required-one door leading from t11is room to the instrument room, and another to the exterior ante room. Tlie 1d10le room under the ::died not being occupied, a la1·p:c anteroom "·ns left for the storage of' hoxc" a11d for a general working and computing: room. The 011ly cxpem;c bestowed upon this part of the building was the cost of a rough floor. The uperaLing room wa:; provided also with a water sink nnd cock for drawing water from a large cask placed at the extreme end of the anteroom. The various chemicals ancl photographic materials required weru obtained in N cw York. The chemicals required are principally nitrate of silver, iodide of potasc;inm, h;·posnlphite of sm1a, and ga1lic acicl, small quantitie,; of various otlier chemicals being :ilf4o pro1·icled; tho variou:' implements for tho plwto;rraphic process, sucl1 a,;; p:ias$ jart<. funnel:', g·las"' rods, gl:i><f4 tnl>cs, brushes, demijohns for pure >Yater, filtering paper, blotti11g paper, a11d towels, cornpleti11g the nccest~ary furniture of the ruorn. The room was provided witl1 two windows, covered with yellow envelope paper to 11revent the entrance of ·white light during tlie preparation of tho paper. The window,; were fir::;t staiueu "llith a :·ellow varnish, but this did not seem to afford sufficieut oh,;tructiou to the actinic rays, and they were then covered with paper. The plwtog:rnphic proce:-B for renderiug: the paper sensitive is quite simple, but considcrablo skill and care in manipulation arc required to produce a ;?]car sheet, liaving· the trace brought out clearly and »rnll defined. ThiR can only he secured by practice and experience. The procef's employed Yaries somewhat with different manipulators ; tho principal operations being tho :::ame with all: these are to saturate the surface first with a solution of iodide of potassium, then with a ,.:o]ution of nitrate of silver. The free nitrate is then rinsed off with pure water and the paper driecl in a dark place; ·wl1eu dr;; it may be kept for several days and even weeks before being nfled. When required for use it fr: put on the cylinder, and after liaving received tbe imprcs,;ions of tlie light from the lamps during one revolution, it is taken off and a weak solution of gallic acid, to ,d1ich a few drops of nitrate of silver are added, is brushed over tbe surface of the paper, which brings out the trace. As soon as the trace is distinct the action of the acid is checked mid the trace fixed by immersing the paper in a solution of l1ypmrnlphite of soda. After haYing remained a sutlicient length of time under the influence of the hyphosphite, it is placed in a swirnmillg dish filled with pure water, where tho surplus chemical;:; are dis;;olvcd and from which jt is taken and dried. Some prefer to saturate the paper with the various chemicals by swimming, others by the use of broad hair brushes, and agaiu others by what is known as Bnckel' s brush, a small bundle of fancy cotton held by a silver wire and a glass tube. .Much depeHdt-l upon personal skill and experience, the purity of the chemicals, and the cleanliness of the vessels and implemeuts. Mr. Samuel \\' alker haviug brought this process to great pcrfectiou in his experience at Key 'Yest, under my direction, and afterwards while in charge of the observatory, I will here give the details of his process in his own words : "Having to-day, May 25, 1860, given up the photographic self-registering observations to Mr. Allen, to be continued by him, I subjoin a brief account of the mode of preparation of the paper furnished by Mr. Hilgard, of which there is on hand more than three years supply.

HEPORT OF TIIE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The building i:-< eight feet five irches X six feet five inches, and seven feet high to the pitch of the roof: it rests upou stone supports, a central stone pier serving to support the instruments in use. The i11struments are a theodolite magnetometer for determining the absolute declination aud horizontal intensity, and a dip circle of large dimensions for observations of the dip. Openings, closed by sliding·doors in the roof and sidefl, admit of observations on the north star, alld on the N~W. and Key \Vest light-houses. 'The nortlnveRt light, distant several miles, furnishes a good azimuth mark, the Learing of wl1ich was well determined. The theodolite vf the m<1guetometer furnishes the means of determining the time. The instruments when mounted being protected from the weather tliey may he kept in place for any desired interval of time, aml observations taken in conjunction with scale-readings of the fixed instruments. The lmilding and pier were put up under my direction, and the observations then conducted by Mr. Samuel ·walker. The following results were obtained previom; to my departure from Key \Vest.

A discrepancy occurs in the observations of l\Iareh 17 which cannot be due to the azimuths, as they agree; it can only be explained by subsequent results. It may be due to the effect of the change of the pier from brick to stone.

The observations and computations of these results am giYCil in the volume of reC'ordf' herewith transmitted. The ob:-;ervations with the portable instrnmenfa were made by Mr. Samuel "ralker, who assisted me also in putting up the other illi'-trurnenfa, aud whose skill am! intelligence during the wliole work are especially commendable. Mr. Walker has had sole charge of the magnetic station since March 2. The services of Mr. G. D. Allen were eng<1f!:ed for the summer month,.,, and if necessary continuously, as observer, in place of )fr. 1Valker, when the condition of the climate t!lwuld render it necessary for the. latter to leave Key W esL Mr. Allen was iu:,:.tructed tborouglil;- in the use of the instrume1rts, and from bis skill and knowledge, accompanied with a zea~ous interest in the success of the obt!ervations, will, I think, prove a valuable observer for this station. I desire to express my warmest acknowledgments fur the a;;:-;istance rendereJ to me and to the survey, during the. progress of my labors at Key W e;;t, by Capt. E. B. Hunt, Corps of Engineers, and Mr. James Clapp. Diagrams illustrating the plan of the observatory and the mode of mounting the fixed instruments are given in Sketch No. 23. Diagram No. 1 represents the plan of the observatory, the relative positions of the piers, and the general arrangements of the operating room. Diagram No. 2 represents the mode of mounting the dcclinomcter and hori~ontal force magnets, and the recording cylinder and clock for both. Diagram No. 3 represents the mode of mounting the vertical force magnet, and its clock and cylinder.

REPORT OF TlIE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDlX No. 27-.
Description qf the magnetic station at Eastport, JJiaine, by Assistant L. F. Pourtales.
COAST St:RVEY OFFICE, October 23, 1860. Rm: In complianr.e with yonr instructions, I visited the magnetic station at Eastport, Maine, and have the honor to pre;;;ent now the following: description of it. The site of the station was selected u:r Assistant Geo. ,V. Dean in the foll of 1859, and a small woodt,n i'tructure 1Yas erected Ly him on the spot. It is situated neaely in the centre of the parade ground of Fort Sullinrn, in the town of Eastport. The formation on which the fort standil is tr~p, mostly covered with a thin laye1· of earth and grass, hut the f'nrfacc iH liare in many places. It is a pm·t of uneven plateau extending over the island, which here falls off quite f'teeply to the cast and south. The parade ground i;; surrounded on the west, north, and cast by buildings, all of wood, except a magazine, which is built of t'tone. On the south a clear vie'v ifl afforded over the towns of Eastport and Lubeck, the harbl:li, and Campobello island and Grand M:anan. The height is about one lrn11drc<l and twenty feet aboYe mean low 'Yater. A plan of the fort, showing the exact position of the magnetic station has been deposited in the archives. In December, 1859, )lr. G. B. Yose, who had been assigned to take charge of the station, (and at the same of a self-registering tide-gauge,) proceeded to Eastport ·vi th the instruments, consisting of a magnetometer, theodolite, dip circle, chronometer, sextant and artificial horizon, self-regi~tering tide-gauge, and a set of meteorological instruments. · The little structure put up by Mr. Dean was found too sm:rll to bold at the same time the magnetometer and dip circle; it was, therefore, enlarged by Mr. Vose, and is now eighteen foet long from cast to west, with a breadth of ten feet from north to south. The dip circle stands in the N,V. corner, and the magnetometer in the SE. corner, the distance of the instruments from each other being 14 feet G~ inches from centre to centre. Windows admit the light to each of the iiistruments, and the building is entered by a door on the west side. The material used in the construction is one-inch pine boards, and the roof and sides are shingled. Of course no iron is used in any part, all the fastenings and nails ueing copper or zinc. The steeple of the most eleYated church in Lubeck serves as a meridian mark, it is about three and a quarter miles distant, .and bearn 31'.8 east of south, as was found by observations of Polaris, near elongation. At first Mr. Vose used tho flag-staff on Campobello island, and afterwards a flag-staff at Lubeck, for a mark, but both are inconvenient. The latitude and longitude of the station have not yet beeu accurately determined. The magnetometer was constructed in Washiugton by Mr. W. Wurdemann. The magnet box and suspension tube are made ia, the form usual for portable instromen(j, and placed over the ceutre of the azimuth circle. The telescope is supported on inclined pillars connected with the alidape. Tl10 circle is six inches in diameter, and reads to thirty seconds by two verniers. The collimator magnet A is St inches long, and 1li0 of an inch in diameter, and light enough to be suspended by a single fibre. The scale is divided on the glass at the north end of the magnet. This magnet uot \Yorking satisfactorily it was replaced in October, 1860, by another of the same dimensions. Magnet B, used in the deflection experiments, :is 2f-c of an inch in length, and T\- of an inch in diameter. The deflecting bars are on Lamont's system. 'fhc dip circle is by the same maker. The circle is 5~ inches in diameter, and supported on columns outside of tho glazed box. It reads to thirty seconds by two verniers, and carries two microscopes which are pointed at two small holes in thi! needle. The azimuth circle reads to minutes, and is also 5~ inches in diameter. The needles, numbered 1, 3, and 4, are 9~ inches in length, aud the reading points are 7~ inches apart.

The routine of the work is to make observations .on four days in eYery montL, general!.'' tlic fmnteenth, fifteenth, Rixteentl1, and seventeenth. Ohservatious of declination an: made half hourly, from six o'clock a. m. to three p. m., or until the diurnal motion of the needle has becomP- retrograde. In the intervals observatimrn for dip are rnade witl1 t\\-o needleB, four sets with each, in two of whieh the poles are reversed . .After three o'clock observations for horizontal intensity are made. first liY dicfleetiolls, the magnet A_ being used to deflect magnet B suspended, and fifterwards liy vibr;tious, the time of two hundred of which is recorded. · From time to time the vibrations are made with the inertia ring 011 the magnet to determine the moment of inertia. The torsion is always ubserveu before aud after t lie vibrations. The magnet A. being found to change its maguetie axis, obserYatio11s for deterrni11iug the zero of its scale were made before and after the other obsen·ations.

APPENDIX No. 30.
Extracts from Ute report of Sub-Assistant F. W. Dorr, de.~criptivc af tl1e c-0a8t featurei; · 11ear St. Aug11sti11-c harbor, Fl.a.
BosT·3N, .April 24, 18GO.

Sm:
The outside beach, both abDve and below t~ entrance to St. Augustine, is of sand, backed by a ridge of sand hillR from fifteen to thirty feet in height. TheRe sand hiUs, and, in fact, most of the solid land between them and the inside marsh, are covered with the small scrubmik and low palmetto, the whole gro"·tli being absolutely useless even for firewood. The shores of the various rivers are mostly marshy, with occasional hammocks of firm land, the whole country, back to the woods, being intersected by a perfect net-work of creeks. The marsh is in most places quit~. soft, and the creek;:; often so interlaced as to cut it up into numerous small islands. St. Augustine is situate<l on a narro"T neck of firm land befr;-een the S't. Sebastian and Matanzas rivers, and even this is divided in part by a stream call-ed the lfaria Sanchez creek. Anastasia island has much marsh on its western or inside shore, but the middle and eastern portion of the island is compoRed of alt.ernate ridges and valleys, some of the hills being entirely of sand, others having a>l their ground work a peculiar conglomerate of shells, lime,· and sand, called "Coquina." There are several old quarries in the middle of the island whence t.his -coquina has been taken in the old Spani.sh times, for it has sel'ved as material for nearly all the buildings in St. Augustine, as well as the fort and the sea-wall, which forms the water front of the city. The higlier land on Anastasia supports a growth of rather diminutive pineL * * * * * * * * * * * The outside beach north of the entrance is sandy an<l remarkably straight, rising from the water into sand hills of various heights., one, the highest on the bank of the Guano river, being nearly fifty feet above the level of the sea. The country between tl1e Guano and north rivers is low and mostly wooded. The sand hills referred to are in most cases covered with a long stiff grass, which would be sufficient to prevent them from undergoing any serio'us change of posit.ion, except in the event of a succession of very heavy easterly gales. I think, however, that the sea is encroaching, but so gradually that years must elapse before any change of importance results. The shoals near the bar and entrance are greatly affected by the winds and tides, and alter perceptibly from one month to another. Yours, very respectfully,

Re:marks on Charlotte harbor, Fla., u:ith sailing <Iirections for entering, and oilier extracts from tlte rt:port ef Lieut. W. R. TerrilT, U. S. A., .Assistant Coast Survey, relative to the comd between it and Tampa bay. GEORGETOW:\', D. C., April 20, 1860.
DEAR

Sm:

The deepest water at the entrance of Charlotte liarbor is clo8e to the shoal making out fro~1 the southern point of Gasparilla islaud, au<l on it the water breaks in ordinary rough weather. In tlie pass, and close to the shore of Gasparilla island, the soundings give ten fathoms, and from the bar to this point the range is from t\rn and a half to ten fathoms. From the pass up to Punta Gprda (near the mouth of Peas creek) vessels can carry two and a half fathoms. The bar is nearly five miles out from the pass, and shoals up very rapidly. There are two parallel shoals running out and cormectirig ·\\'ith the bar; one from the southern point of Gasparilla, and the other from the northern point of La Costa island. The general direction of these shoals is south·west and northeast. Inside of tlie bar, 1rnar the pass, and just north of the La Costa shoal, is a second small shoal, with one and a lmlf fathom at the shoalest part. Inside of Boca Grande is the anchorage, and on entPring an excellent harbor of refuge ·will be found for vessels not drawing over twelve feet. A bar and a charmel buoy should be placed as guides, and a light near the Coast Survey 8ignal on the southern poiut of Gasparilla is1anrl. would enaLle a vessel to enter at nigl1t. At anchor under the lee of Gasparilla or La Costa island vessels would be safe from those destructive wesie1 ly gales which sweep the coast. Sailing directions for entering Charlotte harbor.-Keep in five fathoms water until the Coast Survey signal or the southern point of Gasparilla island Lears northeast, then steer northeast liy east, one quarter east, and cross the bar with two fathoms and a half of ·water.

That portion of Tampa bay thrnugh which I have passed seems to be favorable for triangulation and topography. Sarasota bay is of the same character as Charlotte harbor from Boca Grande to Bocilla Pass. It ii" from fifteen to twenty miles long, and from one to four miles broad, and inter."persed with numerou;.; ,;mall mangrove keys. The depth of water is only about eight feet, and the snnd aud oyster bars running out from these keys render the clrnnnels quite tortuous. The "Pine 13luffs'' between Sarasota and Gasparilla present the appearance of a dense forest.. The shore is almost a straight liue of sand beach. * * -r.0

* The general features of the country are similar to those parts of the coHst of Texas Jyiug to the northward wliich have been described in previou~ reports of work in this section. The sand hills on the island8 which form tile Gulf shore abreaBt of Corpus Christi bay are generaUy higher than those between it and 1\fotagordai entram:e, and extenu further back from the beach. On Padre island they occupy nearly its whole width. The bluff8 on the mainland are also I1igher above the Gulf level. There is but; very little low or marshy Jund on th.e mainland sides of Corpus Christi b:~y, or of the Laguna Madre. .A.t Flour Bluff the cleTation of the general Jevel of the pYai:rie above the bay is about ten feet, but at the head of Nneees bay it is about fifty feet. At present there aTe but two families residing on Mustang island, and only two on the upper end of Padre i8land. On the mainland side of Laguna Madre there are no settlements for forty inilel', and I am told that 1.here is but one between Corpns Christi bay and Point Isahel. Corpus Christi, on the south sl10re of the bay, is the principal port between Indianola and 13razos Santiago. The trade into aud from Corpus Christi bay is chiefly carried on by steamboats and small lighters through .Aransas and Espiritu Santo bays to Indianola, and by schooners· to the Florida coa;;t and New York. The last named class of -vessels enter the bay by Aransas !'a,.::;, and find way throngh a channel made by private enterprise into Corpus Christi bayou, and across what are known as the "Mud fiats." This line of communication rww affords six feet of water to the wharves at Corpus Christi. The exports Are hides and wooL and a. little cotton.

The village of Ingleside i;; settled by the owners of ;,;fock ranche;,;. It contains a seminary for the education of youth of both sexes, which seems to be well patronized by the residents of that part of the State. The village is situated on the north shore of the bay, and nearly opposite to the town of Corpus Christi. Its location is pleasant and healthy, and there is an abundance of pure fresh water from springs which issue from the liluf[ some twenty to thirty feet below the surface of the prairie. The north end of the Laguna :Madre is a Rand flat, extending fin· miles to the southward from the lower waters of Corpus Christi bay. On it the depth of water Yaries from nothing to fifteen inches, according to the direction and strength of the wind. After a nortlier has blown for a few hours there i;, no water, and the flats remain Lare or only slightly enverec1 1rntil a southerly wind brings it Lack again. On the island side the flat is about a mile to a mik and a half wide throughout the eutire range of fo1·ty miles, and at that distance from its northeTn end the laguna again shoalR 1-111 the way acrosR. On the mainland Ride the flat is abont half a mile wido. The average width of Laguna Madre, including Padre island, or the distance from the Gulf beach to the mainland of Texas, is about four miles and a half. " * * * Respectfully yours, SA)l"L A.

APPENDIX No. 35.
Supplement to Appendfrr No. 61 in C. S. Report fa;· 1856, on the "metlwd of fr,qfing a repenting theodolite.'·
In that portion of Appendix No. 61 in C. S. Report for lf..5G, which treattt of the examination of eccentricity and grnduation, the omission of the negative sign in one of the normal equations constitutes an error, which, having entered into the computation of the example there given, vitiates the results oLtained. The object of the present article is to give a corrected statement of the former one, and, at the same time, a fuller development of the formula: than was there introduced. The instrument under examination was a ten-inch repeating theodolite, C. S. No. 79, coustructed by Mr. William Wurdemann, and graduated on the Coast Sur.-ey dividing- cngiue. For the purpose of examining the graduation and determining the eccentricity of the alhidade, readings of the two verniers were made at each 10° of the graduation, vernier A being set. each time to the precise reading; the circle was brought round 180° for the pnrposo of reading B under the same illumination, and, after setting the verniers forward HP. the circle was moved back through that angle, so that the person reading did not change his position. With the exception of this mode of takin..,. the readino-s, the method hero detaiied will, of 0 ,., course, apply equally to a 11011 .repcating instrument. The reading::; ::;o taken are recorded below in Table I, where they are arranged in two sets, tho,;c readings differing 180° being placed on the same line.

The differences of tho readings of vorriorR A and B may be due, .first, to their constant angular distance, being slightly more or less than 180'.), which we will designate by 180 +).; sccoudly, to eccentricity of the alhidade, or the centre of its axis uot coinciding preci>'ely with the centre of the graduated circle; thirdly, to errors of graduation on the circle; and fourthly, to the accidental errors of reading. If we designate by µ the effect of eccentricity on the <liffernncc of the verniers, we have for auy position of the verniers, B - A= 180° + 11; and, for a position differing 180° from the former. B - A= 180° + ), - µ. Thus, if we take the meat\ of the differences B - 11- for readiPgs differing 180°, as placed in juxtaposition in the table, this mean will express the angular distance of the verniers cleared of the effect of eccentricity, bnt each value affected by errors of graduation and reading. The column mean, umler B - A, gives the::;e values, the mean of which is+ 3 11 .5, slwwing that the zero on vernier Il is distant from that. on vernier A by 180° 00' 03". 5. In 01 der to determine next the eccentricity of the instrument, we subtract from the differences B - A in Table I the constant difference 3".5 of the vernieni. The residuals will be composed of the effoct of eccentricity and accidental errors of graduation and reading, aud are given i11 'I'able II under the head p + m. If we uow de1:>ignate by s the angular value of the eccentricity, or the distance o!' the centre of graduation from that of motion, expressed in seconds of arc for the radius of the graduated circle, and by p that reading on the limb, which 'v011ld be desiguated by a liue passing from the centre of graduation through that of motion to the limb, the11 (r -- p) i::; the angle which the vernier8 make for any reading 1·, with the line of eccentricity, an<l 2 e sin.

The computation of the latitude, longitude, and azimuth of the geodetic points of the survey is effected b:-· means of the following formula.- and auxiliary tables. The latter depend on Bessel's value of the magnitude and figure of the earth, viz: Equatorial radius, a= 3272077.14 toises = 6377%7.16 metres. Polar radim; b, = 3261139. 33 toises = 6356078. 96 metret'. The adopted unit of length for the distances is the metre. Let K = the given geodetic distance between two trigonometrical points; L = the given latitude of the first point; M = the given longitude of the same; Z =the given azimuth of the first to the second point, counted from t'outh round by west; and let L1, 1'P, Z 1 =the required latitude, longitude, and azimuth for the second point.; also let d L, d ~I. d Z = the difference in latitude, longitude, and azimuth of the two points and expressed in seconds of arc.

In using this table, take out the differences for t.he arguments log. Kand log. d M; the first difference with a negative, the second with a positive sign, and add the algebraic sum to the log. cl M. The second term in formula (3) may generally be omitted; when K is less than 34, 000 metres (21 miles;) cos. ! d K may also be omitted in computing d Z. - d Land d ~I should be computed to thousandths of seconds, and - d Z to bnndredths, for which purpose six places of decimals suffice in the term for computing d Z. For convenience the value log. ar. co. cos. ~ d L has also been tabulated, the argument l>eing d L.

For secondary triangulation, and when the sides do not exceed about twelve miles, the following formulre for the computation of latitude, long-itude, and azimuth may be med a(frantageously: -- d L = K B cos. Z K 2 C sin. 2 Z h2 D .... · · .... · · · · · · · · · · .. · · . . . · · · · · . · · (-!) A. K sin.

When log. h is less than 2. 31, the third term in equation (4) may be omitted. In the computation carry log. A and log. B to seven places of decimals, lug. C to five, and log. D to four places. In computing - d Z the log's d M and sin. ). should be taken to five places for the main chain of triangles, and to four places for subordinate points. - d Land d M should be computed to thousandths of seconds, as before; - d Z to tenths, and for subsidiary points the nearest full second suffices. The two following examples of the computation of the position of a primary and secondary point will further illustrate the use of the tables:

HEPOR'f OF THE BUPERlNTENDEKT OF

APPENDIX No. 37.
Account qf Cauchy's fotcrpo7ation formula.
(l'rcpured by l'harlcs A. Schott, A'sisfant Coast Sun·ey.)

In many pl1ysica1 investigntions the application of the method of least squares becomes laborious whenever a great ntunbcr of complicated c011ditional equations are to be treated;, and it is therefore occasionally convenient to make u:-;e of a sufliciently rigoromi method, which, hardly inferior to that. of least squares, bas the ad \'antage of leading, in Jess time and with Jess labor, to a result of an accuracy commensurate with that of the observatious themselves. Such a method has been devi'1Pd by Cauchy, and it is here proposed to give, for convenience of reference, an account of Cauchy's interpolation formula. It is a free translation from Moigno' s account. in his edition of Cauchy's differential calculm.;, * and has been illustrated with an example. Let y represent a function of x capable of being developed in a converging series, arranged according to ascending or descending powers of x, or according to sines or cosines of multiple arcs of x, or, in general, according to any other fum:tioa8 of x which may be represented by
(1) b c ...· being coefficients to be determined. It will bo necessary to know, first, how many terms in the second member of equation (1) lrnve to be included to obtain for ya value sufficiently close so as not to deviate from the truth by a quautity greater than is commensurate with the errors of obserYation themselves; and, secondly, to express numerically the coefficients of the expression adopted. For the solution or the problem we have given a sufficient number of values of y represented by y 1 y 2 y 3 . . . . . . ?Jn corre8ponding to "the same number of values of x expressed by x 1 x 2 x 3 . . . . x,,, and corresponding to an equal numbe't of values for the functions u v w ...... represented by 1t1 11 2 u3 ..... un for the function u, and by v 1 v2 v 3 ..... v,. for the function v, and by w 1 w 2 ic3 ..... wn for the function w, &c., &c., we 1rnve tberefore the following conditional linear equations:

where i designates any integer number 1, 2, .'J ··· ·n. For a first approximation "e can neglect the coefficieuts b e...... or we reduce the series to its first term, then tho general approximate value of y will be y =a u, ·for which we have the systems of equations-

The ys being given by observation and the terms beyond the first being neglected, these equations will produce different values for a, and require therefore to be combined in such a manner as to render the bad effect on the value of this coefficient, produced by errors in the amount of y 1 y 2 . . . . .

In conclusion, the ad vantages of these fonnulw of interpolation may be stated as follows: 1. They apply to the development of a series, no matter what the law may be by which the different terms are established, and whatever may be the increments (equal or not) of the 'independent variable. 2. The formulro are of eaRy application, particularly if logarithrnlil are used in computing the ratios a /i r . .... . 3. The ;;uccessive approximations are generally obtained with more facility the further we proceed.

4. The proce~s involves at once all the numbers furnished by observation, and hence admits of a very large number of experiment:<. 5. They possess the advantage that for each new apprnximation the successive values for a, b, c · · · . are always those for which w·e need appTehend hut the smallest possible error. 6. They indicate of themselves the moment when the caleulation has aJTived at a sufficient approximation commensurate witl1 the accuracy of the ob,::cn·atious. · 7. The numerical process is checked in its intermetliate steps. The following example has been selected from another part of this report.-(Scc the discus>' ion of the apparent connection between the. angular movement of the horizontal maguelic 11e<.;ule and the variation in the moon's hour angle, as observed and deduced from the o hservatiou::; at Girard College, Philadelphia.) From that discussion the following numerical values have been obtained, they depend on not less than 21, 644 observations taken in the years 1840 to 1845.

DcscrijJtion qf implements dem'sed blJ Assistant Henry .JJHtcliell.for collecting specimens qf bottom alluvial harbors.-(Sketch No. 40.)
in

RosTON, September 30, 1860. Sm: The two instruments used 011 the Boston flatr' consist in the main of long steel rods·, about. half an inch in diameter, terminating in specimen cups, the covers of ·which are opened and closed by the observer in turning the rods or shafts. Each is furnished with a thin metal disk fitted with a spring on the shaft, so as to mark the depth to which the probe enters the mud. Figures 1 and 2 (Sketch No. 40) represent the probes with their specimen cups closed, as they would he ·when the shafts are to be tbrnst into or drawn from the bottom under examination. Figures 3 and 4 show the same instruments when open to receive specimens. In Figures 1 and 3 the shaft, covers, and extreme poir1t of the spear are one piece; but the main portion, or the hollow spear head itself, is movable, and may be easily turned about the shaft which passes through it. 'When this instrument is pushed into the mud to the required depth, the observer turns the shaft with a handle, (not sho\vn in the sketch,) and by so doing uncovers the i<pecirnen boxes, the 8pear head mcanwbile, by reason of its form, resisting the circular movement. The sharp edges of the covers offer little resistance, and move freely. By reversi11g the motion the observer again covers the cups of the spear head, and then draws up the in8trument. The form shown in Figures 2 and 4 differs from the other in f<cveral particulars. The specimen cup and shaft are of one piece, and tbe GOVer is ll10Vable up the shaft by a fine SCreW thread. The thin blades or wings attached to the cover resist the circular motion given to the shaft and cup by the observer, and thus the cup is opened or closed. This instrument is preferable to the other for obtaining specimens of pure mud, since the cover may be screwed tight, and the specimen drawn up through other strata without mixing at all with them. Yours respectfully, H. :MITCHELL, Assistant Coast Survey. Prof. _<\.. D. BACHE, Superintendent U. S. Coast Survey.

ef the method qf applying a new farm qf divi<lers im:ented by .JJfr. Jolin R. Gilliss for the graphical decomposition ef tidal curves.-( Sec Sketch No. 40.)
COAST SURVEY

OFFICE, September 29, 1860.

DEAR Sm: I enclose a sketch of a pair of divideri> devised by Mr. John R. Gilliss, principally for use in decomposing graphically the tidal curves, but which can also be used with advantage for all purposes for which halving dividers are required. 'l'he most laborious part of our process of decomposing graphically the tidal curves into their component diurnal and semi-diurnal waves is the taking of the mean between the ordinates of the curve of observation at points twelve lunar hours apart, for the purpose of eliminating the diurnal wave. It is done by tracing the curve on a piece of transparent paper, and then sliding it twelve hours forwards or backwards along its horizontal axis. Then the difference of the ordinates of the two curves thus superposed is measured at short intervals with proportional dividers, or so-called "wholes and halves" dividers. .At each measurement the dividers are

THE CNITED STATES COAST SUHVEY.

399

reversed, and the 11alf of tlrn distance between tho two curves ie pricked off. These points then joined by a continuous cun'c repre,;ent the semi-diurnal waYe. This process can be gone through mucl1 more ra]Jidly with the dividere proposed by Mr. Gilliss. As you will see by the sketch, they are formed of three branches, the middle one of ·rl1ich is always kept at equal distances from the two otlier;; b~- two diag:onal braces. Slots in that branch at C and B (Sketch No. 40) allow it to rise as the dividers are opened, und a small spiral spring at B keeps the point drawn buck from the paper until the two outside l.>ranclics are placed on the points wanted, when a pressure with the finger on the head iLt C will cause tho middle leg to prick off the middle point. A spring between the outside legs near tbe joint C sen'es to lwep t11em alwa.vs open, so that the position of tlie fingers in holding the instrument need iwver be changed. Iu~tcad of tliis, rings might be adapted on the outside for tbc thumb and middle finger, the forefinger being kept on the head at C. -With either arrange1'lont a person ·will be enabled to work with great rapirli ty after a little practice. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, L. F. POGRTALES, A8sistant Coast Surnf'y. I'rof. A. D. BACHE, Superiutenrlent U. S. Coast Survey.

Report ef Lieut. Comg. Alexander ~vurray, U. S. N., Assistant Coa8t Survey, rclatii·e to the Labrador eclipse cxprdifion, and to incidental re.sults bcarin:t on tbc liydrography ol tlw coast ef Labrador.-(Skeich No. 38.)
U. S. SU-RV-EYING STEAMER Brnn, ~New 1'(1rk, August 12, 1860. Srn: When your telegram was received, on the 16th of June, intimating the probability of tbe detail of the steamer Bibb for conveying t.be astronomical expedition to Labrador, the ve ssel bad been only four days in port, lnviog just then closed a long and active period of duty at the south. Under the emergency which had arisen, extraordinary means were at Jnce applied, though the Bibb then needed repairs, and I was happy LJ feel not entirely unprepared w!ien I received your final instructions for that duty on the 22d of June. All needful ·preparations having been made, and the party of observers in charge of Professor Stephen Alexander on board, on the 28th we availed ourselves of a fair tide, taking our departure from the rnlYy yard at 11.30 a. m., and entered upon the voyage. Tho weather was fair on our passage to Sydney, (Cape Breton island,) but a sail event occurred on the night of the 29th in the loss overboard of John McCalmut, one of the seamen of the Bibb. The vessel arrived at North Sydney (the coal depot) at midnight on the 2d of July. During t~e fine weather of that pint of the voyaga ad vantage had been taken to organize for the observations according to your programme, and to arrange the preliminaries for our work to meet the several contingencies pointed out by your instructions. A mutual good understanding then had, remained unbroken during the expedition. The distance from Sydney to Cape Clmdleigh and back being about 2,400 miles, it became ~ecei;sary, on account of the limited capacity of the steamer, to have coal deposited at some intermediate point; and Domiuo harbor was chosen, in latitude 53° 28 1 ~., and means were

taken to insure tl1e delivery of tlie supply that would be required for the return of the vessel. We left Sydney on the 11ight of the 3d, with as much coal as could possibly be taken on board. Ko pilots could be lrnd fort.he coast north of Belle Jsle, and hence that res.ource might well be regarded as vi tnl to the success of the expedi tiou, morn especially as in the very stormy weather tbat met us in the Gulf of St. Lawrence our entire deck load of coal was endangered. On the 7th of July the Bibb p~·sse<l the light-house of Belle Isle, and proceeded along the coast of Labrador. Icebergs \vere constantly in sight, but not w numerous as to obstruct_ _navigation. The weather continued pleasar1t until the morning of the 10th, when a stiff breeze' from the soutlnrard and eal'tward set ill, with a tremendous sea. Towards eYening the fog began to settle down, and the icebergs to drift toward:> the land. We souglit a harbor, and at 10 p. m. anchored behind an island in latitude 56° 43' N., which afforded shelter from an impending storm. The "·eather continued thick and stormy until tho afternoon of the 11th; but, in consideration of the main object of the expedition, the accomplish~ent of which was hazarded by each delay, I determined, nftor advising witl1 Lieutenant Ashe, R. N., who had joined tbe party at New York, to take the inside passage and push oft, the fog Rtill remaining outside. and the ice lieing pressed close in along the islands. We had in this way made some forty miles when tbc only accident occurred that was worthy of record in tho voyage. While under the least possible pressure, of steam, ai1d carefully feeling her way, the vessel ran upon a ledge of mmken rocks, but with the aid of her nnchors was got off at the return of the tide, and a;;aiu !waded on her course, being at meridian, again in the open sea. On tho 13th of July, whon approaching our final destination, the navigation was ngain interrupted by reefa, over which the sea broke with great Yiolence. We were then nearing the point wl1ere the middle of the shadow of the edipsc was to pass, and, as the time pressed, it became imperative to pass the reef just mentioned, in search of a harbor. The outer line, ten to twelve miles from shore, was easily passed through, and approaching the laud cautiously, we entered, about midnigl1t, into a ch1mnel ·which proved to be the north inlet- at .A.u1ezavik islancL and anchored in latitude 59c 54 1 N. early on the morning of the 14th of July. At meridian of that day a site for an observatory had been selected by the chief astronomer of the expedition, Professor Alexander, anr1 before the clo:-ie of evening the material for the structure, and the tents for magnetic, tidal, and meteorological instruments, were landed. ~i\. tide-staff was also set np, and obsern1tions commenced; but, with this exception, operations were suspended until the afternoon of the 1 Gth b7 a heavy gale of wind, with prevailing rain. At night all the instruments "·ere in their appointed places, aud the scientific work was in full progress under the respective heads. The tenor of ,your instructiomi as to my first duty being ''to convey the astronomers and other officers of the Labrndor eclipse ei>-pedition to the vicinity of Cape Chudleigh, the delays incidental to 11ydrngraphic work were not allowed to interfere with the execution of the first object; lmt that done, my attention turned to the kind of duty usual in the party under my command in the steamer Bibb. A base line having been measured with care, the inlet in which we landed, and which has been named Eclipse harbor, was sounded out. In conjunction with Profes~mr Y mmLle and Mr. Lieber, other explorations were madt-, and the results, as well as the survey just referred to, are shown in the accompanying sketches. An exhibit is made, in a third sketch, of the soundings and ocean temperatures taken on the eastern coast of Labrador. The surface temperature was found to be coldest where the water was deepest and the current strongest, reveniing in tbe "Labrador current" the characteristics of the "Gulf Stream." Most of the iceberg;; are confined to the line of drift marked on the sketch; those that are not being merely fog1tive ones. These sometimes lodge on sunken reefa, and serve as beacons; the wearing of the tidet:i leaving projections above, so that they may be known and used ns such.

DE.\R Sm: In tendering to you tl1ie; report ou the geology of Labrador, or rather of its coast, I Jmye great occ<isinn fo regret that tlie necefsary speed in hurryiug on to the point where the eclipse oli,.;crnttions 'vero to be made. and the equal expedition of our return voyage, prevented mP from obtaining more than vcr:· passing olwervatiorn; on the geognostic conformation of this far nnrtltern 1·eµ:ion. The ouly pointi:' at which we stopped going north were at Xukasusuktok j,.;Jand, near Kain, wl1crc a fog delayed us, and at the termination of our outward bound voyage, Aulcznvik iRland. Returning· we visited Domino and Cha.tcau lmrbor, in Temple bay, both in tlic more sout!iC'rn portionR of Lalirador. These four localities are the only ones therefore which it "·as pos"iblc to in:;pect accurately. Still, we generally hugged the coast so c101:mly, nml thi,.; coa;.;t itself i'-4 rn bold and preeipitouc;, that, knowiug these four points from absolute local in;;:pcction, I found little difficulty in :-.ccking to form a correct idea of the construction of the intermediate l:'JHwes. Yet, notwitl1stumliHg that much interest naturally attaches to the petrograpliy of a regio11 HO little explored :rnd so rarely viBited, it ii:; lesH in regard to the contititue11t varicticc; of rock,; thau in connection with the pmn~rful effecti-; of forces acting upon the surfaec, and rendcTed peculiarly energetic by the rigid climate, that we arc i:mabled to Rtudy the most instru0tive phenomena. I accompan~- this report by a chart (see Sketch No. 38) of the coast of Labrador, compiled from the bc,;t unthoritieR at my disposal,* 011 which I have traced the boundaries of the different rocks o],,-erved b:· me. Tlw.se arc very frw in number. Prncecdiug nmthwar<l from the Straits of Belleisle we 1mve first a coarse quartzoso gneiss, "·hi..!1 j,, ~ecu at Temple bay, (or Chatean hay,) and at Domino, and appears to extend northward tu a point bet\\eelJ Caluileweet and Nain, perhaps to Davis's inlet. North of this wo have the coan;o porphyrni<l grauite of Nain, ·which extends probably to Okkak island, or a point lJdwecn that and Cape ~Iugfor<l. Korth of tliis again we have the gray syenitic gneiss of .Aulezavik, wl1id1 embraecs the extensive region from Mugford to Chudleigh. I. Tire gneiss ef Domino and the region uurth and ;.:oulh of it is of the very coarsest desc:·iptio11; the bed,.; are very thick, anu though often di::;tinctly marked by different composition and color are frequently very much severed by jointure planes and fissures. A.t times entire beds are cornpo;;ed of quartz, ·with very little foreign material, and of a pinkish caet. Ot.her beds abound in l10rnl1lende, and it is this miJJernl no doubt which at Domillo has given riBe to the lJelief in the prc8ence of coal, in cousequence of which, I was informed, some slight exploratim1s lmd been made. These hornblendic beds Hometirnes certain1Y do resemble coal very much in appearance. A very striking instance of this is afforded by ~ne of the most eastern of the E~quimanx itolands, a little rock which rises boldly from the sea, and is shaped like a lady's flat, the band being represented by the dark lmrnblendic bed. At least such I feel safe in considering it after inspecting tho more southern regions of Spotted island and the Isle of I'omh; at Uomi 110 liarbor.

· These were the Admiralty chart of the western half of the north Atlantic, and a manuseript chart politely loaned to me by Mr. Cyrus W. Field, and sent to him by the colonial government of New Foundland-both correc~ed from our own obBervations.

A vil'w of Bil1tk island and vici11ity (:.:.ee Sketch) will furnish a Yery fair general idea of the c:lrnnieter of t]J() coast where this rock prevails. Tho less disrupted nature of the :.:.urfoce of this rock nppcars to offer peculiar focilitic s for the accumulation of water in ponds, which serve :is receptacles for ddic·ionfi Balmoll iTout. From these the Isle of Ponds derives its name. Owing rather to the more wutl1erly latituclf~ than to an;· greater fertiliziJJµ: capaeity of the rocks, more vegeh1tion occurs in this region than in tho:.:.e to whose description '\'C are about to proceed.

These inaccessible hills appear to attain a pretty uniform cltwatiou of three or four hundred feet, while I slwuld rouglily estimate tl1e height of the most prominent mountains of tho main land, whose precipitous sidel:' deseeud unl1roken to tbe ,\·;1ter'" edge, to be about twelve hundred feet, the average height of the littoral face being apprnximately five hundred feet. Bold as this coast is, there are not many single mountains Yisible from tho water ~o conspicuously individualized by a freely traced outline as to appear in a drawing with the striking effect which they produce upon the eye of the actual beholder. The summit outline is generally too even-too little serrated-to appear to advantage in a picture; so that nlmo:,;t nll the sketches I took from the hurricane deck of the steamer Bibb, whi1e she was gliding along the tortuous sound of Newark island would fail to furnish more than a very tame idea of the character of the scenery.

the outlines of the numerous islands of tho group, :md connecting also with the nearer, more northern cliff;; of Orton island, (not rncn in the figure)-all theo;c are foatnreR which must impress themselves iudelibly npon the eye of the l1eholder. Scarcely less conspicuous and unmistakable are the clearly trncG<l patche1-1 of snow-drift on its face, which I have endeavored to delineate with the utmost care, uccause evanc;;cent as tl1c'y might at fin;t tlionp;ht appear, it is scarcely possible that. such really should be the caioe, Rince they necessarily must adapt themselvt~s to the iucqualitio:-: of the f'nrface; H> tlmt they may wGll Le regarded as relial1le laud m<trks during those seasons of the ~'cnr in whicli the entire ,iurface i,; not equally whitene~l. I ha n~ represented the '·Bi bu'' as passing through the inlet for the purpose of indicating it" whereabout" in the drawiug. The Routhern and wuthcnstcrn t'ides of this mountain present no equall,v striking outline, although its elevation and 8now-furrowed side8 re11der it, even wht:'Il viewed from those points, sufficiently conspicuous for nautical purposes. After sighting it, however; it may be better tu adopt a more northern or nortbeasterly course for the purpose of avoiding the islands, thouµ;h no doubt with experience as a guide they migl1t be peuetrated with comparative safety, for along the eutire coast the water i,; tleep and naYigable. The granite lielonging to this region is extremely coar,;e, and often hornblendic in its composition, approximating therefore to syenite. The folspar i,; genernlly of a pale flesh color, and appear,; to be orthoclase. It seems, howe\'er, that this is tho rock which contains the most beautiful of aU fobpar,:, to which the country has given it,; name, the labradorite. I am inclined to believe that I found a minute particle of this mineral at Domino, but it was too small to enable me to satisf)' myself, and I cannot, not even admitting thi,; inst<tnce, regard it as also regularly belonging to the gneiss of that region. On Xewark iillaml, however, or at least on one of the island~ of the same group, one of our sailorn picked up a very handsome piece, now in the posseef'ion of Lient. As lie, R. N.; and tl1e ausence of more numerous discoYeries I ean aserihe only to the short time which could be devoted to this region, and the necesi'aril:· very in,;ufficient scarcl1. I am additirmnlly induced to consider the vicinity of Nain al'. tht: true loeality of the '' lal>radorite,'' IJccfrnse Na in is the only spot in Labrador outside of tlie Strait;; of Bdleif'le where white meu arc perma11ently f'ettled and remain throughout the year. That cocl fi,;liermen 011 their anmrnl visits to the E'Outhern portion of the coast should pre,.;erve and transmit Fpecimens of tl1i,; mineral iR certainly far lcs8 probable than that intelliµ:e11t Moravian missionarie1> from the self-sacrificing little colony of Nain should collect the curio,.;itit·8 of their ncighl1orl10od ancl transmit them to Europe for scientific investigation. It is ncvcrtbcless evitlent that this felspar i,; rare eYen here, and that the flesh color variety prevails. The quartz uf the ruck is whitish and ratlier vitreous, the mica and hornblend black. In a generous climate thi,; roe]>: would produce fine arable soil. Here this is, of course, not the case. Decomposition is liarely not.icea1Jle in its effects, although the frosts and thaws exert a p<merful disintegrating influence. The absence of level land at the base of the hills prevents thii< erumbli1ig rock from accumulating to auy extent, and it is ouly in the valleys that a few tdrnggling fin; of >'tunted growth may he seen. The various mosses thrive as a matter of course, while licheus of black and orange color contribute to enliven the land.,;cape a little; and though the graceful wild lily of Clrnteau bay has entirely disappeared, quite a handsome nosegay may yet he gathered from the mo1:1s·meadows of the rugged islands near Nain. On Nukasusuktok islarnl I first 1:1aw the little scarlet moss which clings to the surface of the snow, and lms eau;;ed the latter to he termed "red snow." IIL The gneis8 (!!

We notice it first when it presents the remarkable outline shown in the drnwing, (Sketch No. 38.)

It is then distant about 20 mile.s, uearinp: N'V., aud no one coulrJ possibl~· fail to recognize its ragf!;ed surface. From Mugfor<l northward we observe an infinitc·ly greater variet_\· of form in tLe outlines of the mountains than that whid1 prevails further south; ;·me! since this i1Tqrularity an<l diversity continues on to the rcgiou of .A.ulezavik, which alone, in tliis portion of Labrado1-, I had an opportunity of examining, there seems to be good rem;on to consider tl1c petrographic region of Aulezavik a,- commencing near that point. Mo;;t con.spicnom; and mo:<t surprising in all thi,- profuse ii-regularit:· is thC' nater-shapc, which constantly reappear" iu all its individual vm·idy. I first 0\1:-;en«·d thi,.; in ll1l; rq!i<·n south of Capn Xiaku11go, a portion of whiel1 I ltaYe figured, (see Rketch,) a,.; ,.;cen at a distarn·e of about twenty miles. One of the· crater·sha1wd n101111tai11s is then· cxhibikd staudi1q:?,' 011 :l great plateau high above the level of the sea. Except in otl1cr portion:< of Labrador itself I question whether there a.re many parts of the \\-orld wbicli could exhibit equal variety iu coutonr within the few miles here represc11ted, mid, considering that this illuslrates hut one instance of the coni:;tantl_Y recuning volcano-like cones, it. will not appear surprisintr that we all imagined that we there helH·ld the mighty e,·idcnceR of extinct Yolcanic action_ To me some of them appeared very clo8dy to n'semble tbe cub of the trachytic µ-roup of tlie Auvergne_ The deeply packerl snmy in the dcpre:-::'ion i11crca,,:ed the effect; bnt we did l!Ol tlien t:tke iutu suilicient comiideration tLe immen:se po\Yer which tlie untemperncl climate of these region,; wields. Jt has been said that the crater-::<lrnpe iR often repeated. A mountain in the s:outhcrn part of .Aulezavik island, seen in the <lrawiug, (Sketch No. 38,) at a distauce of about six miles, affords a remarkably fiue illu;;tratiou. Agaiu, tlie white snm\· relieves the interior, and it i,; certainly very difficult to convince ourselves that this is not an ancient volcano. Still the nature of the rock utterly prevents this supposition, for it is simply a syenitic g-neiss. '''e shall again recur to the probable <·aui'e of this crater-shape, but for the present denite our attention to the character and compol"ition of the rock. Syenitic gnei~s is the true rock of the region, the normal one, although so many modifications occur that entirely new rocks are produced; rocks having no direct conncctio11 with the basic syemttc gneiss. In conecqucnce of this we have beds in which quartz alone occurs, or bed" entirely occupied by the red folspar of t.lic region, as is seen with very beautiful clistinctness in some of the dangerous Pikkintit islands. Again, l'Ome beds arc composed of white quartz and tourmaline, as in X orway, others contain sea.reel~, anything: but black tourmaline, or tourmali11e and garnets. Some are composed of green hornblend, approximating to actinolith. From this there seems to be a passage into a coarse diorite rather porphyroid in its character, but occurring in regularly intercalated beds, uot in dykes, and evincing 110 tlign oi an eruptive ongm. Again, some beds are composed of quartz and garnet, while others arc studded with a beautiful golden-colored mica. A rock which appears identical with aphanite, althou~h not at all igneous, I also found. Yet, with all this apparent variety,* the transitions arc too gradual to permit the differences to leave any effect on the landscape- The gnci;;.~ if' uniformly grey, upon close inspection; hut in the lan<lscape t.he entire rnonntain masses receive a bronze color, but little dimmed even by great distances in the clear, and, from ifa ,·ery clearness, to our unaccustomed eyes, deceptive atmosphere. The Vandyke brown of the wild mountain groups is relieved by nothing but the white snow. No tree is there. The orange colored lichen, which we tlaW at N ain, has disappeared, and patches of a black one alone remain to deepen the shading·. Still, in some of t!te level places, the snow moistened moss meadowti flourish, and lend their gentle green or soft 3·ellow to diversify and mellow the rough outlines of the landticape, while tho shallow rays of the northern

sun, penetrating through tl1e leaves of the ruby sea weed on the beach, often recall colors which liclong to a more genial clinw. But these aTc eomparativclv exl'eptiom; to the rule. The impression made upon our mind,; is that all orgcmic nature has Leen banished from tlie spot. ~ot n.s ffe conceive it to lrnve been in the early days of creation, \\-hen the inorganic kingdom also se~med to be kept in aheynnce and the land scarce rose above the water, but, as if in the absence of all softening, snbdui11g vegetation and stirring life, the very rocks revelled in tlwir freedom. In a view of the wild mountains in the interior of that portion of northern Labrador which lies between' Aulczavik island and Ungava ba}-, as seen from a mountain side above the magnetic tents, I have endeavored to convey some impression of the nature of this dreary spot. I allude to one of the drawings enclosed, (Sketch No. 38,) but an abler pencil is re1uired to do justiee to its savage grandeur. The wild irregularities of this country are produced in part, in part perhaps only increased, by several different causes. In the £rst place the rude stratiform character of the rock is really better adapted to the production of angular and distorted outlines than a compact, unstratified structure. As far as m:_i' experience goes, gneiss always furnishes bolder contours and more precipitom; cliffs than granite, provided, of course, that the general level of the countrv is sufficient to admit such extremes. Nor is this surprising when we consider tliat irregular surfaces are the result of counteracting force:,;, whether these be the extreme hardness or cohesion of the rock ou the oue hand, and forl'e exerted hy erosion on tlie other, or the tendency towards a definite and often parallel fissure formation in the first place, counteracted hy an ir~egular fissure formation, protluced by totally different causes. Hence it may, I think, be safoh- set down as a geologic law, that, with equal degrees of hard1te8s in the roek itt;elf, 1:1tratifiration,. cleavage, or Jointure planes 1cill increase rather than diminisl1 the irregularity qf tf,e sm:face. Only where these arc horizontal may it sometimes occur that this rule does not hold good. In the ·present instance the dip is generally vertical, the set a high angle ;;outh ward, the strike principally to the north. This, therefore, to commence with, may be regarded as a prominent cause of irregularity, mid the infinitely less elevation of the more southern gneiss region of Labrador can alone be as~urned a8 a cause of tho much more undulating nature of the surface, notwithstanding that the same general circumstances as to the nature of the rock exist there also. A second cause of tho irregularity of surface here is to be found in tho tremendous force of the frost of a Labrador winter, the influence of the heavy covering of snow, and very probably also tbc former existence of glaciers, all of which we shall presently take occasion to discuss. In addition to all this, we find that the absence of all vegetation in this triste and barren region deprives the landscape of that subduing roundness produced by foliage, to which we, inhabitants of kinder countries, are accustomed. The effects of frost are manifested in a singularly forcible manner. The entire surface, where it is not too steep to enable debris to collect, is covered with broken masses of rock, cubes of ten foet and less scattered in wildest profusion. Sometimes a patch of moss, the g-rass and heather of this country, fills up the creviceH, but generally we may look down into them far and deep without ever detecting the base upon which the blocks rest, hurled aloft, as they appear, Ly the hands of Titan;;. In scaling, in company with Mr. Venable, the summit of 11ount Bache, on an occasion intended mainly for taking its altitude barometrically, we enjoyed the finest opportunities for studying this phenomenon. The summit and sides of the mountain present few steep precipices. 1 speak comparatively only, and in reference exclusively to northern Labrador. Yet, iscattered helter-skelter over all, and piled up in endless number, the whole surface is covered with such loose rocks. The ditliculties of locomotion may readily be conceived. In i;,carcely a single instance did we see the gneiss beds still in sitn, and in the only one or two exceptions some giant wedge seemed to have driven them

asunder. Yet none of the blocks were rounded. Attriti011 of no kind had influenced them to any pcrccptiule extent, neither bad atmo;;pheric i11ilucnce;; alternJ tlle color, hardness, and compositiou of their exteriors; it was simply a wildorne::;s of unclrnngetl Llocks of the gray gneiss. There was a puzzle. "\\'hence came those broken rocks? There was no hir.clier &pot whence they might have follen. The <'-light protrusion of tho nptilted l·eds of guci!'s in >'itu, to whif'.h I have referred, aloue semn to have been permitted to remain for tlic pnrpo,;c of instruc:tillg us. Clearly, that force whieh had riven its bed1< a;;:under, !HJ otlic>r than tliefmst, had broken the rest from their foothold and prepared them for removal Ly :mother coming into \·lay at a later season; the thawing, dm,·nward·gliding s1wu:. Many of tho lilocks were probal>ly lrnt slightly moved from their original po;-;ition, perhaps barely turned over or merely forced a littlu out of place. Yet the effect to the eye of the beholder would 110 as groat as if they lia<l been transported hundreds of miles. vVhen we descended from tho mountain we crossed over a broad patch of snow, deeply packed,* which dearI;.~ taught us how the rocks were moved. In truth, this was a miniature glacier and a regular morrain was piled up along its edge. It it< impossible for us to form any estimate of the amount of sno1'· ·which may fall per square foot in a winter, but from tlie fact that such quantities were still remaiuing late in July, and certainly th Py m~ver altogether thaw away, we may reat5onably iufor that durinp; it;; dowrwrnrd progress, either as snow or water, a tremendous force mmit be exerted, a foTce quite suflicient to account for the characteristic surface pltenomeuou just describeu. But to the l:'l1ow may also, I believe, be l·eforred the still grander effect evinced in the proc1uction of the crater·like coucavitics. This crater ,.Irnpe is not confined to the mountains here. We frequently observe it with icebergs, all(l it is probable that in bot11 cases the cause may be a similar one. Corurneuciug witl1 a more or less irregular surface, when it break;; loose from tho Arctic glacier;,;, the weltiug ice ;,;ends little streams down the inclined pLmes of the surface of the Lerg. In the depression water collects and expedites the melting of the ice beneath and around it, while those portions from which the water is drainel! are necessarily melted m1wh slower, so that the two extremes are increased until we Jiayc lJcrgi,; resembling craters, turrets, castle ruins, and irregular shapes of all kinds. A similar proce;;s may, in the course of time, produce the crater-shaped mountains, some chance circumstance of superficial form first determining the bed of the accumulating snow and the course of the water triekliug from it. This explanation is certainly. I admit, not very clear nor very conclusive, but wo must remember several other matters. In u region where the surface is too rough to admit of rivers or streams to any extent, where enormous masses of snow accumulate in the depressiorrn und lie there during the greater part of the year, they may very naturally be supposed capable of producing effects unknown to a,ny similar extent in milder climate>:;. Re;;ides the t"·o gn'at leveller8, soil and vegetation, are absent. 'ro what extent actual glacial action may at onB time have prevailed it ie difficult to 1<:1y. The numerous inlets about Nain are certainly, singularly like the Scandinavian :fiords, which are regarded as the beds of ancient glaciers; and it wonld require no great stretch of the imagination to conceive the sound of Aulezavik island to have been tho same, especially as it is separated from the north entrance by shoal waters and a reef of rocks, expo;;:ed at low water. A closer examination of this singular coast would teach us some great trutlrn, 110 doubt, and be alile to clear up much which is still quite unexplained in regard to the glacial period. Unfortunately my time was too short to emible me to discover anything substantial uud satisfactory in this respect. Besides, an examination aiming at a full determinatiou of all facts connected with this and similar inquiries should seek its field of observation in the interior perhaps quite
