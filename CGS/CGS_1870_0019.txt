REPORTCOAST SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., February 7, 1871. Sm: I have the honor to present, in conformity with !aw and with the regulations of t1ie Treasury Department, this report, showing the progress made during the year preceding the 1st of November, 1870, in the survey of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and of the western coast of the United States. The season generally was favorable for field-work on both sides of the. continent, and the surveying parties being, by custom, ready for service as opportunities offer, the advance has been highly satisfactory in the development of coast features. In proportion to the means, good. progress has been made also in the hydrography. The means provided by Congress at the last session will, at an early day, supply facilities for again pushing the off.shore work. Vessels are under construction to replace the scliooners which are not now seaworthy, and two steamers have been contracted for, of size sufficient for hydrographic operations at exposed sites along the coast. As early as possible in the progress of the survey, the coast was marked off into portions, to be ultimately represented by engraved charts, uniform in scale; the series of sheets being continuous for the Atlantic aud Gulf coasts. This coultl not be done until many points along the sea-board had been determined accurately in position. And, even with the best-defined shore-line,. many difficulties would have been met in subdi\"iding so as to give the greatest utility to the intended publications. Of aids to navigation, and sea-marks, the greatest number possible should appear on each of the sheets. This is but oue of the desirable conditions. Though we have separate harbor-charts, yet no harbor should be represented in part only on any of our coast-charts. By careful study, however, with regard as well to the limitations just mentioned as to the positions of ports, lights, and headlands, the difficulties have been adjust.ed as far as possible, and now each of the coast-charts, not already engraved, only awaits the completion of field-work and hydrography within the limits which it is to illustrate. Thus, for several years past, the arrangements for :fieldwork have been in part determined by the condition of the office-work. In some instances, as in regard to the chart of Chesapeake Bay, and others which were iss.ued as early as possible for general uses, parties have since added material, to appear on new editions of the engra\иed charts. Each succeeding year brings into view the practical wisdom of the plan upon which the survey was conducted by my predecessor. Under his direction charts of the large seaports were prepared early, to meet the most pressing wants of commerce and navigation. These were to be followed, and have been followed, by the issue in recent years of charts bearing more intimately upon the coast trade. At the same time the off-shore hyrlrography advanced, continuous observations wero made on the tides and on currents, and local surveys were prosecuted when their utility for public purposes was clearly set forth. It has thus resulted that, while the survey steadily went forward elsewhere, opportunity, as at first intended, has been given for frequently examining the condition of the principal port entrances and harbors.. Incidentally, the more important channels have been several times reviewed, and attention has been invited to them occasionally by the municipal authorities. Reports were promptly made by the surveying parties after each examination. The charts of comparison which accompanied these special reports soon enlisk>d the regard of city authorities for interests that were manifestly liable to injnry from artificial encroachment on the water spaces, as well as from natural. causes. As a consequence, local laws have been enacted in some cases, and it is hoped that, under their operation, or under aome protecU1e law of Congress, our chief harbors may be preserved from injury, as far as the laws of nature will permit. H.Ex.112-4

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

But the natural forces themselves, which are concerned in the formation and >arying conditions of our coast harbors, are within the domain of calculation, and the results from such studies must bear ultimately upon the means adopted for preservation. Moreover, cognate questions of much interest ha>e recently arisen, one of which is in regard to expedients for the reclamation of tide-lands for agricultural purposes. Ou this I will remark separately. The series of observations on currents and tides now on record in the office, furnish data which have already been employed in the investigations needful for developing the effect of artificial or natural changes in situations subject to tidal action. :My personal attention is enlisted in the analytical treatment of the questions which must arise in such investigations. It will be seen by reference to .Appendix No. 1 that the survey in one or other of its branches , of work has been prosecuted within the year in all, excepting three, of the sea-board States of the Union. In Part IT, short abstracts, arranged for convenient reference, will be given of the re.ports from the field-parties. .A brief statement, mentioning the sites of the operations, a<:leompanied the estimates which were submitted in September last, for continuing the work during the next fiscal year. .As all the parties were at that time yet in the field, the synopsis referred to will in general terms be now recapitulated. On the coast of Maine, the harbor of Moose-a-bee Reach has been surveyed and sounded; progress has been made in Southwest Harbor, (l\Iount Desert Island), in the surrny of the Fox Islands, and in soundings at the approaches of Isle au Haut Bay; also in the survey of islands bounding Gilkey's Harbor, (Penobscot Bay), and the western shore of the bay has been mapped between Clam Cove and .Ash Point. ~he banks and channels of the Kennebec have beeu developed.between Richmond and Gardiner; the coast has been surveyed from Old Orchard Beach southward to Cape Porpoise. Stations have been examined in New Hampshire and Vermont, for bringing Lake Champlain into geodetic connection with the survey of the sea-board. On the coast of :Massachusetts, the operations include in-shore soundings between Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and the mouth of the Merrimac River, and supplementary work in Plymouth Harbor and Duxbury Harbor; astronomical observations at Cambridge, for determining the longitude of Burlington, Vermont, and the difference of longitude between Cambridge Observatory and Brest, in France, the intermediate station being Duxbury, where observations were also made by telegraphic exehanges with Cain bridge and with Brest. Examinations have been made in the vicinity of Marshfield and Scituate, to determine the effect on navigation of expedients proposed for reclaiming tide-lands. On the shores of Narragansett Bay and Saughkonnet River the survey has been aetl\'ely pushed, and one of the topographical parties has kept the field during the winter near Newport. Tidal observations have been kept, up at the established stations of the eastern coast, one in Penobscot Bay, aucl the other at the Charlestown navy-yard, and a series of observatums has been recorded at New Haven, in connection with a review of the triangulation points adjacent. Progress has been made id the systematic survey of Lake Champlain. Near New York, the positions of all the buoys, lights, and sea-marks concerned in navigation have been determined 1Jy angular measurement; and additional soundings have been made on Diamond Reef, off the Battery, on the Oil Spot to the eastward of Sandy Hook, and on Flrnn's Knoll, at the entrance to New York Bay. Tidal observations have been continued at Go>ernor's Island. The currents in East River have beerr further investigated. By lines of level and barometrieal observations the heights have been determined of the primary geodetic points between Hudson River and the Delaware, and stations have been selected for connecting Barnegat Light-house with the main triangulation. On the coast of New Jersey the topography has advanced southward from Great Bay to .Absecom and .Atlantic City. .A party is now at work in Delaware River. In Maryland and Virginia, Rtations have been occupied for the main triangulation south of Washington City, the operations including also observations for latitude and azimuth. The magnetic elements were determined at Washington, District of Oolumbia, and at Harper's Ferry. Progress has been made in the triangulation of the James River, and the base-line near its en trance is now connected with the triangulation of Chesapeake Bay. Many of the branches of that bay, of local importance, have been surveyed and sounded within the year, as also the Broad Water on the sea-coast of Virginia, north of Cape Charles. .Along the sea-board of North Carolina the bydrography has advanced southward tQ Oape Hatteras. In Pamplico Sound the survey includes the lower part of Pamplico

River; also soundings in Long Bay, and in the иdcinity of Brant Island Shoal. The present condition of the western entrance to the Cape Fear River has been developed by soundings for comи parison with previous surveys. In view of taking up the plane-table survey, the station-marks along the coast of South Carolina have been examined between Cape Roman and Charleston, arnl the triangulation southward of that city is now connected with stations on the south side of Savannah Hiver. Plane-table work in that vicinity includes parts of :May Hiver and Wright's River, with Bluffton and otlter districts on the sea islands of South Carolina. On the coast of Georgi<t the work done embraces the topography of Saint Andrew's Sound and Cumberland Island, with bydrography connecting the two entrances, and also developing the tide-water passages between Uumberland Sound and Saint Andrew's. Saint Augustine Harbor has been sounded, in connection with parts of the Tolomato and l\fatanzas Rivers. The principal keys in Barnes' Sound and Chatham Bay, near the southern end of the Florida Peninsula, have been mapped within the year, and on the Florida Reef important hydrograpbic developments have been made in the vicinity of :\Iarquesas. The survey on the Gulf includes Saint .Andrew's Bay, on the western coast of Florida; the hydrography of Lake Borgne, the H.igolets, Lake Saint Catharine, and part of Lake Pontchartrain, on the coast of Mississippi; the shores of Isle au Breton Sound on the coast of Louisiana, and the surrey of the banks of the Mississippi Rhиer, from Fort Jackson upwanl to Grauel Prairie. On the coast of California, by extending the main triangulation of the Santa Barbara Chanи nel, that work is now partly connected with the sunиey of San Francisco Bay, the longitude of the station at Los Angeles having been determined by tho telegraphic method. The operations of the year also define the coast features between Point Fermin and Point Vincente, and between Point Gorda and San llnonaventura. \Yestward of Santa Barbara, the surиey now extends to the Goleta. The harbor of San Buenaventura has been sounded, as also the reef in the Yicinity of Piedras Blancas. In addition to the continuous tidal observations at San Diego and Fort Point, a series was registered in July and August, from observations on the tidal currents in San Francisco Bay. By angular measurement the positions of buoys for the navigation of San Francisco entrance have been determined. At Punta Arena the operations include the plane-table survPy, and observations for latitude, longitude, and the magnetic elements. Humboldt Bay bas been sounded; its shores have been mapped, and the coast northward of the entrance as far as Gil.ton's и Bluff. ]from Urescent Uity, California, the topography extends northward to Chetko River, on the coast of Oregon. The topographical survey of the shores of the Columbia River is now continuous from the entrance upward to Three Tree Point and Cathlamet Head. Tidal and magnetic observations have been made at Astoria, and magnetic observations at Portland in Oregon. Iu Washington Territory the work done defines the south shore of the Strait of Fuca from New Dungeness to a point eastward of the entrance to Port Discovery, including vVashington Harbor and the shore in the vicinity of Point Wilson; also that of Admiralty Bay on the western side of Whidbey Island ; and the surface details of Smith's Island and Minor Island south of the entrance to Rosario Strait. иwhile carrying on the triangulation a dangerous reef was disco\'ered by soundings in that vicinity. East and west of Fort Nisqually, the triangulation has bee'.l extended to connect the important astronomical station at Muck Prairie with the survey of Puget Sound. Tile operations of the Coast Survey Office, embracing the computation of observations, the drawing, engraving, and publication of maps and charts, have kept pace with the field-work. Eight new charts have been published, and twenty-three others have been advanced by adding the additional results of the previous season's field-work. Eleven new charts have been commenced, and fifty-nine in all have been worked upon. Of the various engraved charts, tweln~ thousand copies have been printed, and ten thousand four hundred issued. Seventy-two manuscript ma11s have been copied or traced for various departments of the public service. Tide-tables for ti.Jc ports of the United States for 1871 have been computed and published, and a new revised and illustrated edition of the Pilot for the Pacific Coast has been issued. The utility of the results of the survey for general uses, and the confidence "\>hich attaches rightly to the product of systematic operations in geographical development, are Hidenced in the continued calls for information. Of severa.I classes into which the data now on record in the office might be separated, each has contributed items to meet corresponding requirements. Ju regard to

matter thus given, the Treasury regulation enjoins merely that acknowledgment be made in the publication, if the facts derived from the records of the survey are to be so emoodied. The items communicated in the course of the year are recapitulated in .Appendix No. 2.
EST IM.ATES. In explanation of the ohjects contemplated under the estimates submitted at the end of last September, for continuing work during the fiscal year 1871-'72, I would state that, of the increase proposed for the western coast, twenty-five thousand dollars would provide for the employment of the new steamer now building for the survey of that coast. It would also, in the simplest and readiest manner, provide for the special hydrograpldc development mentioned in the proviso. The importance of this provision became known to me during an official visit to San Frnncisco in July, when I learned that unmarked dangers to navigation exist on the sailing route of our steamers between San Diego and Panama. The Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco subsequently took action on the subject, aud their urgent memorial in regard to tlrn survey of the route is now in my hands. It is hoped that Congress will sanction an object so important to the safety of our citizens and their property in the line of transit between our eastern and western coasts. The additional fifty thousand dollars of the estimate is internled for the survey of .Alaska and the .Aleutian Islands, in conformity with the recommendation addressed from the Treasury Department to the House of Representatives at the last session of Congress. Contracts have been made for the building of several new steamers; for which the means was appropriated at the last session. Hence the item in estimates, for the pay and rations of engineers, has been restored to the amount which was allowed in former years, pre1'ions to the decay of the
~~L

.

The next item is also restoreu to the original estimate. It is intended to pay for prepal'ing the manuscript records and results for publication. This is a work c1emanding much labor of a special kind, and it is hoped that adequate provision will be ruatle for that object. A new item is proposed in the i;.stirnates, small in amount, but of inestimable importance to the scientific accomplishment of the survey. .As suggested in the proviso which is attached to the estimate for the geodetic C2E..I!~Et!o1!.k~tw~{_ln ~IJ.e .Atl~nticapd Paci.fie coa~ts, a collateral advantage will result, which is :ilso very great in comparison with the sum to be expended. It will give the Nationa1 Government, and incidentally to the several States of the Union, the best possible basis for all accurate surveys which may hereafter be required. The points deter.mined by the triangulation will be carefully marked to await the future wants of the several States. To some of them the work already done furnishes these in.valuable data for their ultimate surveys, and the proviso is inserted in order that the same advantages may be impartially extended to the rest of the Union; first of all to the interior Sta.tes which lie within the range of triangulation which must join the two coasts; and finally, under the authority of the proviso, it will be extended to all the States equally without limitation.

GEODESY. The problem of finding the geometrical expression for a surface most nearly in accord with the results of astronomical aud other observations, made ,in the progress of the primary triangulation, has been as far advanced by Assistants Hilgard and Schott as the present state of the fiehl-work will admit. They have also indicated the field observations yet neede(l for the solution of the problem. A preliminary discussion has been made involving a large number of conditional equations between latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths determined on the coast of New England and iu the Middie States. An a.re is thus intercepted of about nine and a half degrees; the triangulaи

tion is yet regarded as developed on the surface of Bessel's ellipsoid, but the computation of the geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths, as now intended, will apply ultimately to a surface deduced from the whole series of measurements, making the sum of the squares of discrepancies between the geodetic and the astronomical measures a minimum. To the analysis of this problem in its generality my own personal attention will be given. THE RECLA.l\fATION OF TIDE-LANDS. The reclamation of tide-lands for agricultural and commercial purposes having of late become an object in the investment of capital, Assistant Henry l\fitchell, in charge of the Physical Hydro~и graphy, was directed to investigate the various schemes presented, with a view to ascertain in what measure enterprises of this kind are likely to effect navigable channels. The office is frequently called upon to furnish information derived from our surveys, and the opportunity is thus afforded for encouraging the utilization of wast-0 marsh-lands, and at the same time advising the communities which undertake these works against injurious encroachments upon their valuable water-ways. The problems offered in the reclamation of land are the reciprocals of those which have been studied relative to the preservation of channels, and they pertain naturally to the domain of our physical surveys. I have, therefore, instracted Assistant Mitchell to meet, as heretofore, calls for information, and at the same time to report the nature of the projects proposed, and their bearing upon matters of navigation. Among his reports of the past season, one upon this special subject is given in the Appendix No. 5 of the Report for 1869. The importance of the matter is well stated in the opening remarks in that paper, which cite the results of experience in Europe to show how frt>,qnently reclamations, improperly planned and executed, have caused injury to navigation, even at a considerable distance from the actual ground of operations. :Mr. l\Iitchell's discussion of the origin of the marshes and the wear of the outside coasts, as inviting to further study, is deserving of special attention. He concludes that the waves of the sea, in washing down the lieadlands, assort the materials ; that the stones go to build the shingle-levees and the coarse sands to the extension of beaches, while the finer material is driven into sheltered coves and that it ultimately forms the marshes. Evidence from surveys and from many reliable observations certainly warrant the belief that the great gulfs and bays open in the direction from which storm-winds commonly blow, are extending into the continent, while all sheltered harbors and coves are filling up. As a general rule of easy application for deciding upon the practicability of lowering the waterlevel of a river by constructing a transverse sluice-dam, I have proposed the following, and at my request it is discussed in the report of Assistant Mitchell, namely: Draw a tangent to the tidal curve at the point where tlw tidal current cliangcs from ebb to jf..ood; if this tangent int.ersects the descending branoh, tke reclamation wUl preserve from overjfow all tlte land tliat is higher tlian tlw point of intersection. Under Section 11 mention will be made of the local examinations of the present season to which the principles thus far developed are applicable. ODITU A.RIES . .Assistant Edward Cordell, of tlie Coast Survey, one of the most accomplished of hydrographic officers, died suddenly, in the.prime of manhood, at San Francisco, on the 25th of January. In the record of this sad event, it is fitting to make mention of the иqualities thus lost to the setvice. For some years previous to his period of duty afloat, Mr. Corde1l was known and recognized as a hydrographic draughtsman unsurpassed either lin skill orи in the finish of his charts. There was at the sa.me time, latent under an unobtrusive disposition, the ability to master any difficulty presented in the branch of service which it bad been his pa.rt to illustrate. Io 1862 he took charge of a bydrographio party, and at once brought into practical use the observa.tions and experience quietly treasured while associated in a less active capacity with sounding parties. The Jarge hy<lrographic results of the three following years on the Atlantic and Gulf ooa.st.s were evidence that the veracity and finish of his charts rested on a complete mastery of all the principles involved, and a special readiness in their application. Ardent iu service and um'ivalled in the profession, he

THE UNITED STATES COAS1' SURVEY. was, in 1865, placed in cltarge of the hydrograplty of the western coast, and there eYinced special fertility in applying expedients for the prosecution of tlitficnlt work. His calm wmperament and unvarying courtesy to his aids and men Juul ample returns in thei1и cht'twful compliance with the requirements for the service, incident to his own euergy. In Assistant Cor<lell were joined great executive ability, system, and consecuthиeness in action, and the spirit to incur any reasonable risk or iwrsoual discomfort in the performance of dnty. In every relation his loss is deplored uy his associates. lli11 name aml his rnmuory are Rtill left to honor our roll of hydrographic officmиs. Assistant John G. Oltmanns, after a protracted illness, died at Hollywood, on Mobile Bay, on the 2d of Se1ltember, and, as he had pre\иiously re11uestcd, was "-Tapped in a tlag of the Union for interment. In the assimilated rank of ma,jor, lrn h:i1l rea.lizetl throughout the war the collateral advantage that may inure iu military service, from previous experience in peaceful field-operations. Mr. Oltmanns joined the Coast Survey in 185:l. As a ci,иiliau he worked subsequently in widely separated sites on the coast of tlie Uulf States, altematel,y in triangulation and as a topographer. The unflinching resolution which sta.yed up a constitution, not rolm:-;t, umler lmrdships and risk of health in the civil serviee, accompanied him in the performance of adjunct duties with the fieet and armies that operated in the Valley of the Missis:si ppi. Jtefereuce lias hceu made in previous annual reports to the activity and constancy of Mr. Oltmanns: in thus sustaining relations which enhancetl bis responsibilities. Consnm~1tiou had undermined his strength, and the cri11is of disease was hastened in consequence of a severe wound, canl'led by the passage of a rebel ritle-ball quite through bis lungs. This occurred iu May, 1862. He rallied from that critical injury and continue(\ in service on the Mississiflpi and in Louisiana. Though his life was seyeral times in great peril in that quarter, he returned to the office when hostile movtiments ceased, and went through the subseи quent campaign in the Shenandoah Yalle,r. ln that, as iu others, he accompanier! the staff, and contributed to the service the results of his aptitude in reconnaissance and in sketching maps. \Vith characteristic energy he resumed fieltl-\Hwk in the surYey of the Gulf coast at tlte close of the war, and completed labors tha.t could he undertaken only by one iuured to the hardships and discomforts of a camp at sea-level. 'l'he last :-mrvey h.r this amiable and highly-esteemed officer was finished only a few weeks before his death.

PAR11 II.
The distribution of the stuveying-parties on tbe coast of the Atlantic and_ Gulf, and on the western coast of the United States, is exhibited in tahnlar form in Appendix No.1. Uorresponding in general order to tbe list of names and places there given, the notices in this part of the iиeport will inclutle onlinary piuticulars; the meutiou, as heretofort:>, being confined to the essential facts pertaiuiug to each of the surveys; hence the notices will regard such details only as are most likely to be sought for in future reference. The mnml order will he ohsmиved, Section I beginning at the northeastern boundary of the United States, on the Saint Croix: U.iYcr, in Maine; a.nd Section IX terminating on the Gulf at the Rio Grantle, on tl;e coast of Texas. From San Diego northward, Sectfons X and :S:I include the Pa.citic coast of the United States, to the mouth of Frazer River, in \Vashiugton Territory. In the course of the year, the triangulation and reconnaissance for its extension have been continued where required for the regular progrnss of the survey aud, in ex:cc11tioual cases, for the publication, in advance, of charts called for by the immediate necessities of commerce. On the Atlantic and Gulf coast, the details of the triangulation in relation to the branches of work depending upon it. have been further s_ystematized by the Ape-eial at~ntion of Assistant mchard D. OuttA. To his large experienue and his readiuess iu field-operations is due the conviction that any emergency likely to arise in the progress of the sunиe.r can be promptly met. Mention will be made under proper heads of the field-work in which he was pe.rsonally engaged ; in addition to which he visited and conferred with several of the chiefs of parties in their sites of work.

On the eastern coast of the United States twel\-e parties ba.\-e been employed, at eighteen different localites, iu triaugulation or in collateral duties. Two bases of yerification haYe been meaimred, one 011 the Onlf coast of Florida, and the ot.l1er 011 the coast of North Carolina. A preliminary base was ah;;o mPasurerl, under 1lw dirrct.ion of Assishtnt Cutts, near the sbore of Lake Champlain. Ju Section II, t.ho routine of operations was varied during two months of the working-season, in order to meet the direction contained in tlte act of Congress, entitled "An act making a1lpropriations for sundry ci,иil expenses of the Goyernment, for the year oudingJ uue 30, 1870,'' approved J uJy 15-that the moans tborcit1 1mwide<l for continuing the survey of the Atlantic and Gulf coast. sl10uld be applied, iu part, for a sur,-ey of Lake Uhamplain. The system and methods used in the ' sun'ey of the coast were, in conseqnence, with a suitable force, transferred to the lake, and the survey was advanced as far as the limited season and the collateral interests of work on the coast would allow. The progress made in tlie survey of Lake Champlain will be described under the head of Section II. On a review of the facts which give it special importance, the pro\""ision hy which it has been included in survesiug-operations seems to he fnlly warranted. и This uarrow lake, ahont one lmutlrcd mileA in length, and entirely within the limits of the United States, is connected with Hudson Rh-er by the Champlain Canal, and With the Saint Lawrence by its natural outlet, the llichelieu Ri,иer, tl1e navigation along the latter being improved by the Chambley Canal. Thus there is an almost direct line of water-communication h<>twcen New York City and .l\fontrc>a.1. Further improvements now in progress, and others which are Jlroposed, will shorten this line, aml realize, it is expected, all the advantages for domestic iutercommunieati'ln to he 11crivell from the position, direction, and extent of Lake Champ lain, as a natural link betwPen the great lakes aml_the Atlantic Oeean. It isиintendc<l to make the new canal, to connect tlie navigable waters of the lake with the Saint Lawrence auo,-e Montreal, of capacity suflicient to pass vessels of 850 tons. Lake Champlain, when this is accornplisbeu, will Lie one of tlte principal rontPs or tntde aJH1 commerce between tlie Northwc>stern aml tl1e }jastern States of tlie Union. UPsi<les the aid to co1rnnerce which will be afforded by a thorough snnиey aud development of the channels of the lake and of the dangers to its navigation, the connection of the survey with the geolletic work already done on the coast will incidentally snpply data of value for the improvement of the post-route maps, antl for the extension, previous to measurement, of the arc of the meridian which passes through the valley of the Hudson. To this arc furtber allusion will be made in its proper place. In April last the Committee on the Post-Offices and Post-Roads, of the House of Itcpreseuta. thиes, refoned to my attention suggestions made hy the topographer of tile Post-Otnce Department, with a view to improve as far as limited means would allow the imperfect state of maps which of necessity are yet used in contracts for mail-service. The needs thus brought to view in regard. to facilities for puhlic uses, are obvious. l'ro\'ision might in time be made for tllcm by the adoption of tlie plan for triangulation across the States iiwlnded in the estimates for the coming fiscal year; and if the exigencies of the postal St'rdce permit the <lc1a:y, tlte method therein proposed would suffice. The su~ject presented h_y the committee was, however, regarded as of high importance in itself, but, in so treating it, tlle ulterior advantages that might be tlerived from auy ouUay for that specific object were kept in view. 1 therefore approYe the remark, in tbe report by Assistant Cutts, which was transmitted early iu May, as a response to the request of the committee, that "in the mean time every extensive survey undertaken by national or Stat.e authority, should be exoouted,иas far as possible, with a view to ultimate connection with the net-work of triangulation, starting from the coast and extending o\'er the principal valleys of the interior, so that each survey made may be placed hereafter in its proper relative position." Besides the immediate uses contemplated, the work submitted to the consitleration of the Committee on the Post-Offices and Post-Roads would be valuable in other respects, as suggested in my remarks which accompanied tbe estimates for the next fiscal year. The expression of my thanks is due to Assistant Cutts for the special care, and for the syst~matic precision which mark his treatment of all questions pertaining to the branch of service under his charge.

The general care in nиgard to topographical details bas been continued with Assh;tant H. L. иwhiting. Most of the plane-taule parties were Yiisitml whilll at work iu the iicltl, with r1>forence, as heretofore, to maintaining uniformity in the style of representation. The varty operatio 118 connecteu with the topogmphical suryey of Lake Champlain were arranged b,Y i\Ir. "~llitiug. No delay ha8 bccn JlCnnitted in applying the means, a11propriated hy CougTcss, for new Ycs."ieL~ to replace those which have been worn out in service h,y tltc topograpltic;il arnl hydrographic parties. The special care of the bydrographic inspector, Captain C. P. rattcrnon, was, at the earlie8t moment, girnu to details iu regard to lhaught, size, and such other particulars iu the co11struction of the vessels as would gh-e the utmost elliciency for the outlay. Coutracts were m:ult\ as soon as possible, and, in the iuterests of the sen'ice, unremitting attention bas heen gi\-en to immre complete satisfaction iu the delivery of the vessels. It is expected that two of the schoo11ers and a. small steamer will uc really for sen-ice early in the coming spring. The hydrogrnphic didtsion, mea11whilc, has been maintained in its accustomed relation to the other branches of the office . Original charts as they arl'i\'C are examined with reference tu 8tamlanl rcquimments, aud selections are made from the sounding8, so that the engraved charts may be charnflteristic of tlie coastapproaehes which they are to represent. The routine of the dh'isiou in other respects has uceu kept up as heretofore, aud my thanks are due for tlle great advantage which accrues to the senиice from the ability aud experience of Captain Patterson. On the western coast, the season was in general favorable for work, and the statistics iudicate that every opportunity was taken to make advances in results. Assistant Ueorge DaYiuson, in addition to the operations conducted. by himself 1icrsonally, imqH~ctell most of the other sites of operatiom; in the comse of the year and indicated the limits of tl1e field-partieR. It was a source of gratification to find in July, when I visited Sau Francisco, that all the plans approved iu tile prece11ing winter were going forward in accordance with the respecti\'e allotments. Of the large result:,; brought in at the close of the working season, separate i1otices \\'ill be matle nuder the liealls of t:iections X and XI.

J):nиit!son ga,-e attention) as heretofore, to the develop~ent of the different branches of work on the l'acitic coast, aud to questions of collateral importance. The results of his experience aml observations on the fogs, in relation to the best aids for navigation, have been communicated to the Light-hom;e Board, as al1-10 his views in regard to the location of light-houses aud buoys. He has met the uumerous calls at San Francisco, and elsewhere on the Pacific coast, for iuformatiou such as cau be llcrived only from final snrve_ys. These applications arn comprised with others of like ch:mwtcr iu Appemlix No. II. Assistant Davidson has also much advanced the compilation of the sue01Hl part. or his Uoa.stPilot for Alaska, and the publication may be expected at an earl.Y day.

From time to time tracings of tlle sllore-line were furni8hed by Assistant Donn, and the Yicinity represented by each was filleu with soumling8 a8 the weather favored, work afloat being 80metimes practicable in the western eutrance, when it wa8 not so in the eastern part of the Reach. " The hydrography includes Nash faland light-Louse to the westward; and .to seaward Flat Island and Crumple Island; also the adjacent waters; lndiim I-~h'er, Chandler's Bay, West Rh-er, and numerous coves. l\Iany ledges were patieutIJ- developed by soundings, I.mt some yet remain to be examined in order to complete the curve of depth at three fathoms. One hundred and tixe signals were used for byurographic purpo8es. Of these sixty were erected by the party of .Assistant Nes. :Messrs. W. I. Vinal and R. B. Palfrey served as aids. Tidal obsermtion8 were made and recorded as usual while soundings were in progress.

Between the Wt! and 2!Jt.11 of July, a reconnaissance was made, and at tbt' latter date the triangulation was commenced and continued systematically until the 19th of September, when the operations were completed. As a basis for the leveling, a mark was made at low water, oil a pile of the steamboat-wharf in Southwest Harbor, and a bench-mark was established oil the wharf. The difference of elevation between these two was detel'miued by the spirit-level, and also the difference of height between the bench-mark and the telescope at the station" Church Spire," (Southwest Harbor,) at whiuh the vertical angles were commenced.

Denni:;, and was complerod on the 18th of ~overnber. On the south side this work joins near Ash Point with the plane-table sheet showing South Thomaston and its vicinity. The topography mapped represents a fringe averaging a mile and a half in width from the shore-line of Pe11ohscot, Bay, and extending northward to a point about half a mile alloYe Clam Cove, where J'llr. Deunis joined his work with a survey previously made hy A8sistant Dorr. \Yitllin the limits described arc included the cit_y of Hockland, and a large amount of such detllils as require the utmost care of the topographer. After completing the 8heet, Assist.ant Dennis mapped a small area for connecti11g the topography of George's ltiver with that of Teunant's Ifarbor. His results are shown on Sketch No. 15.

Topography a.n<l liydrograpliy of the Kennebec IUver, Mliine.-Field-work was resumed iu the Kennebec by Assistant C. IT. Boyd on the 25th. of ,July at Richmond, (Sketch No. 15,) the topograph.r of last sear having included Swan Island. In its comse upward the plane-table work of the present season shows both banks of the river as far as Gardiner, in varied detail, some a mile hut others only a half a mile from the shore-line of the Kennebec. The bydrograpby of the river was eompleted within the same limits, and a series of tidal observations was recorded, as usual, wl1ilc the soundings were in progress. In order to take in Easteru River, l\fr. Boyd made a triangulation of- its course and inclmled it in his topograpbical and bydrographic survey. Ile alHO ran a line of lernls, in the aggregate twenty-seven miles, to connect with the tidal-station established in J861 on Merry-Meeting Bay, the stations at which observations bad been snbsequcntly made by officers of the United States Engineers, or by himself at Gardiner, Hallowell, and Augusta. The tidal observations made below Gardiner are on record in the <Joast Survey Office. The report of Assistant Boyd describes the river obstructions that exist between Richmond and Gardiner. These are all within the reach of ordinary engineering expedients, and will, doubtless, soon be removed. The statistics of pfane-table ;i,nd hydrograpbic work are as follows:

Dean was at the same time dilиected to nok, 011 the inLerveuiug gronud, the feasibilit.y of connecting stations uear the l:tke with the llearest stations of the primary triangulation of the coast of New J<Jngla11(l. Mount \Vashington, although uot occupied with the theodolite, was marked and observed upon in 1849 from one or the coast Rtations uettr J>ortland, and subsequently from three others. Mr. Dean identified the marks at that station, aud theu Yisited Mount Mansfield, in Vermont, where, however, owing to smoke in the atmosphere, the shores of Lake Champlain were not visible. The reconnaissance was continne1l in the Yicinit.y of Saint~ Albans, and thence, down tl1e lake, by the way of Burlington, to Cahl well. At a suit~tltle eleYation there the observer finds in Yiew the Green Mountains to the eastward and the Adirondacks to the westward. Passing by the way of South Adams, Mr. Dean reached Greylock l\1ouut, the highest point in Massachusetts, on the 1st of September. F1иom t.hat summit three of the priiwipal stations which have been occupied in the survey of the coast are visil.lle in cle.ar weather. Other duties pressing at the time, the reconnaissance was extended no further. 111 order to complete tlw examination, Gunstock Mount in New llampsllire is yet to be visited, ltnd the praetfoahilit.y a1:1ct'rtained in regard to its connection with Ascutney in the town of "'est \Vhulsor and Mount :Mansfield in Vermont.

Hydrograpliy between Portsmoutlt, New Bampxhire, rmd ]lferriumc Entmnce, lllassachusetts.-\Vitb a vessel chartered for this work, Snb-AsRistant Horace Amlerson took up the service early in August, using also boats which had been lent by tile Commandant of the Ollarlestown Navy-yard. The in-shore hydrography was prosecuted until the 24th of September, the party, at that date, having completed soundings along the coast of New Hampshirn and Ma8sachusetts, between tlie entrance to Portsmouth Harbor and the mouth of the Merrimac Hi \ er. Many ledges were developed, the coast approaches being lined with them between Hampton Uiver and Portsmouth IIarlwr. The rocks existing here are from balf a mile to a mile offshore; some are sunken and others stand three or fonr feet out of water. Rampton River entrance was somHle1l lly }fr. Anderson, and the 1lepth on the hmи was fouud to be only four feet at mean low water. 'l'he channel in8i<le, moreover, is narrow aml intricate. Tidal observations were recorded by the party at tbis entrance and also at Rye Harbor, for the adjustment of depths, the soundings being matle nuder fiwomble circumstances at all stages of the tide. _ Messrs. F. \>V. Ring and W. II. Stearns served as aids in the hydrogrnphie party. The chart resulting from the work has been received at the office. Longitudc.-1\Ieution will be made under Section Hof the determination of longitude at Burlington, Vermont. Tile results were obtained by onr established mctilrnl, telegraphic signals being exchanged at instants of time, well ascertained by the olJseiTatiou of particnllU' stars. As usual, the free use of their line was afforded b,y the Western Union 'relegra.ph Compauy. Professor Joseph Winlock, director of the Cambridge Ouservator.r, exchanged star-signals with Assi8tant G. \V. Dean, on the nights of the 2uth and 28th of September, an(l on the night of the '.M of October, one observer being at Cambridge and the other at Burlington. The co-operation of Professor Winlock in similar determinations will be referrml to in tbe notice which :follows. TranRatlruitic longitude, 1Ju:cb1try, Jlfrt,,ysaehusetts.- \Vhen my last an nnal nиport was closed, AssiHtant George ,V, Dean had arrived at, Brest on tlrn coast of Frnnee, to exchange time-signals with Assistant Edward Goodfellow, who remained at Duxbury, working iu a t.em porary observatory uear the French callle office. In procuring the authorization needful for his proposed telegraphic obsen'ations, 1\lr. Dean was cordially welcomed at Parhi hy the United States minister, Ilon. E. B. Wa8hbume, and his secretaries, Colonel Hoffman and Colonel Moore, and by their kindness was introduced to tbe naval secretary of France, who <lirected that every facility should be extende1l by the naval commander at Brest. 'l'his intention was cordially fulfilled. A station was selected by l\fr. Dean in the grounds connected with the "Establishment des Pupilles de la ~Marine," at a measurell distancfl of one hundred aml twenty-six meters from the nearest geodetic point of the survey of France, which is near the center of the tQwer in the church of Saint Louis. The inspector of the French telegraph lines, ~foasieur G. Duval, furthered the operations proposed, by extending wires to connect the longitude station with the French cable office, which was about half a mile distant. Astronomical observations were commenced by Assistant Dean and Sub-Assistant F. Blake, jr., at :Brest, on tile 27th of December, and continued until the 10th of February. In the favorable intervals between those dates the local time and instrumental corrections were determined hy 290 observations on sixty-two zenith and circumpolar stars. The portable transit No. 4, adjusted upon two granite posts, was used for the purpose. Time was recorded on a Bond ehronograpb by a Frodsham break-circuit chronometer. Acknowledgments are due for the frienclly antl valuable co-opemtion of Cromwell F. Varley, esq., of London, electrician of the French Telegraph Cable Company, who directed the arrangements needful a~ St. Pierre for joining the two parts of the cable, a.nd made adjustments for the electromotive force, so that, as applied at D11xbury, St. Pierre, and Brest, the velocity, as far as possible, might be the same for all signals made in the determination of Iongitmle. The length of cable tbl'()llgh which the signals passed is 3,84 7 sta.tute miles. Exchanges were successfully made, on ten nights of January a.nd February, between Mr. Dean, at Brest, and Mr. Goodfellow, at Duxbury. Whenever practicable, during the exchangel'i with Brest, the chronograph shoots at Duxbury were

graduated l.Jy the mean-time clock of the Cambridge Observatory, under the direction of Professor Wiulock, and by the sidereal clock at Duxbury; and the signals sent to aml received from Brest were recorded upon t.lie chronographs at Duxbury and Cambridge. For the purpose of measuring personal error in noting the cable-signals, Assistant Goodfellow arranged a circuit to pass through the clock and chronograph connections at his station, aml и through the cable-key and break-circuit key in the cable office at Duxbury. This circuit was worked by a battery of three Daniells cells, while the circuit for obtaining signals like those received during the longitmle experiments was operated by a single cell of l\Ienotti's battery, forty having been used for the electromotive force in imssiug signals t-0 Brest. This second circuit inclmled the galvanometer which hatl been used for longitude. The signals for personal error were given in the battery-room of the cfl.ble office, out of sight and hearing of the observer in another room of the building. Three sets of signals were thus notell on different days. The stars observed at Duxbury for local time and instrumental corrections were taken from the American Nautical Almanac, and from a manuscript list of stars, the positions of which had been determined under the direction of rrofe8sor \Yinlock, at the Cambridge Obserrntory, for the use of the longitu<le parties of the Coast Sun'ey. Assistant Goodfellow recorded 447 observations upon 103 stars, among which were fourteen circumpolar stars observed for thread-iutenals. After closing his observations, l\Ir. Goodfellow carefully marked the position occupied by the transit instrument. A granite pillar 21 inches long and 7 inches square was set in the ground and surrounded with curbing of oak, insi<le of wliich was placed a granite slab 28 incl1es square and 7 iucltes thick, supporting a 14-inch cube, also of granite. Copper bolts half an inch in diameter were inserted vertically in tlic tops of the upper and lower stones; the space left inside of the curbing was filled with sand. The point thus marked was referred by triangulation to a geodetic station, (West Duxbury spire,) and will ultimately be connect-0d also with the primary station on .Manomet Hill, on the coast of l'vlassa,elmsetts. lly preyious arrangement, as stated in m;y report of last year, Pl'Ofcssor Winlock coиoperated iu the reference of the transatlantic longitude to the Cambridge Observatory. On fiye nights, closing with the 3tl of January, signals were sent from antl received at the observatory arnJ Duxbury. .Assistant Goodfellow was aided by Mr. J. Laurence \Vilcle. The computations needed for deriving from these o!Jservatious the difference of longitude between Brest and Duxbury have been intrusted to Professor Joseph Lovering. Assistant Deau, after returning from Europe, WftS engaged in duty which will be noticed under Section II. In November he joined the expeditionи of Professor Winlock, which was sent under my direction to observe the solar eclipse of DecemQer, 1870, at a station in Spain. Sub-Assistant Blake, after completing clnty to which he hatl been assigned in Section III, was authorized t-0 accompany the exploring expedition of the Navy which sailed for the Isthmus of Darien in De. cember. . The favorable circumstances attending the ontset of the work at Brest and Duxbury were referred to in my last annual report. It is agreeable to add that the operations tllroughout wei:e furthered by the s11eeial liberality of officials who took pleasure in acts done in the interest of tile people. Free transportation was accorded by George l\:lackenzie, esq., agent of the French. line of steamers, in the shipment of instruments used in the observations at Brest. The report of Assistant Dean specially mentions also the ample facilities afforded by Thomas Andrews, esq., superinteus,lent of the Frencli cable at llrest, and by Mr. Gott, superintendent at St. Pierre, under favor of the credentials received at New York from L. G. Watson, esq., agent of the French Cable Company. In their movements the observers in France were much assisted by tbe care and attentiou of Monsieur Gustave Eossange, of Paris. The Duxbury longitude station was connected with the cable oflice by wire furnished free of expense to the survey by 1\foses G. Farmer, esq., of Boston. R. T. Brown, esq., superintendent of the nuxbury Telegraph St1ition, contributed valuable assistance, as did also .M. J. Gaines, esq., u.nd the 01~rators in the cable office, all aid being cordially tendered that could avail in the success of the operations. The use of the land line of telegraphy between Duxbury aml Cambridge, as iu a number of previous instances, was freely accorded by the district superintendent of the Western Union TeleH. E:x:. 112-8

The like spirit of liLeralit,y on their part has been the subject of acknowledgment on other occasions. Hydrograpliy of Plyrnoutlt Bay and Duxbury Haramи, Massaclmsetts.-After setting up a tidegauge on Long Wharf at Plymouth, the party of Sub-Assistant Anderson started with boats and sounded out the shallow parts of Plymouth Bay, completing the hydrographic survey within the и shore-lines. Additional lines of soundings were then run in Duxbury Harbor, com1>leting the survey of that vicinity. This work is shown on Sketch No. 16. Sub-AssistaJ}t Anderson is now on duty in Section VII.

Reclamation of ti<lc-lands.-In a general way reference has been already made, in the introduction of' this report, to complex questions likely to originate in attempts to reclaim laud that is ordinarily covered by title-water. \Vitllin the past year two sites were examined by Assistant Henry Mitchell. Ju both of them matter of much interest was presented in considering the general effect of tl!e works requisite for producing the special result desired. The vicinity of North Hivcr, on the coast of Massachusetts, was found specially interesting, as well from local peculiarities as from observetl changes which the stream had suffered by movements of tbe sbingle and sand a1011g tbe coast during storms. There, as at other places, Mr. l\Iitchell car('. fully measmcd the shingle lenws, and found the seaward slope to be the type toward which the dike-building of B nrope has been tending. Ile shows, also, in his discussion of the subject, that their heights may he regarded as the measures of certain great storm-waves, and that their rearward slopes are those of' k:rnt r<'sistaucc to the esc11ping water of 01erflows. The effect of a dam in backing up the iulanu waters he computed for the conditions obscrvetl at North Hiver in Jmie last, and the heights to which the dikes should he carrirnl, 80 as to protect the incloscd land8, were carefu1ly determined. 'l'lie prohlem of reclamation there presented is by no means a simple one, but the result of the study is, upon t)le whole, fa1orabJe. Tlie second ease investigated was that of Green Harbor, a very simple one in the matter of drainage, but complicated iu its relation to navigation. Tb.ere seems to be little doubt that the depth of water upon the bar of this harbor is maintained by tlie tidal outflow, and that tlie dflptlt must lessen after the construction of the proposed sluice-dam. During part of the summer Assistant Mitchell engaged in physical researches in S:in Francisco Bay, mention of which will be made under Section X, in the body of this report. After his return from service in the Darien exploring expedition, Sub-Assistant H. L. Marinden resumed his place, and has continued on duty in the party of Assistant :Mitchell; Mr. F. II. North has served as aid, and his efforts are commernled in the report of the season. The topographical maps requisite for the investigations at Marshfield and Scituate were ina<le in the field by Mr. 0. H. Tittmann, under the general direction of Assistant II. L. Whiting. Triangitlatiun of Narragansett Bay, Rltode L~land.-With a view to perfect the connection between the former work aucl the triangulation executed by Assistant S. C. McCorkle in 1869, and to supply points required by t11e topographical parties on the coast eastward of Saaghkonnet River, :Mr. Mccorkle received instructions, immediately on his return from Section VII, to proceed to Narragansett Bay and to make the necessary observations. The work was commencetl on the 17th of June and co1npleted on the lGth of July, and, by the 22d, the computations were finisbC{l, and these, with the original and duplicate records, were forwarded to the office at 'Washington.

Between the 22d of July and the 12th of August, Assistant l\1cCorkle was cugaged iu computations connected with his work in Florida, and toward the close of the month he rec.eived instructions for duty on Lake Champlain, to which reference will be made in tho next section. Topography of NarYagansett Bay, RTwde lslaiul.-This survey has been advanced nearly to com pletion by the party of .Assistant A. M. Ilarrison and others working jointly ou the ground hut with separate plane-tables. The details of topography were resumed by l\Ir. Ifarrison early in .July, and were mappetl in to include the north end of Rhode Island, below Bristol Ferry, before the close of September. Assistant O. T. Iardella joined on the 23Ll of July, and worked with a detached party. Two other sheets were completed in the course of the season under the direction of Assistant Harrison. These include the vicinity of Newport and the lower part of the island between Narragansett Bay and Saughkonnet River. The topographical features are wIJи intricate, involving broken shore-line, with reefs extending seaward ; outlying rocks; rocky bluffs and fissures; and hills very irregnlar in contour. Few places immediately on an open coast embrace within a limited area such variet~и in surface details, and which, as likely to be permanent, are so proper to be included in the publication of the final chart of the bay, which is shown in Sketches Nos. 20 awl 21. Assistant Charles Hosmer commenced on the 3ll of July, aml continue1l iu the fleltl until the 12th of September. Iu the interval he traced the ea.stem shore of the Saughkonnet Hiver, and made a detailed survey of the features between the shore and the road that runs nearly parallel to it, through Tiverton. In its character the sheet was made conformable to those previously done by Assistant Harrison, the several parties liaYing conferred with him at the outset of the season, to insure that end. Assistant Ilosmer was aided in the field by :!\Ir. A. P. Baruanl. Before engaging in the section, J\Ir. Ilosmer had been on service in bectiou V, and Im,:,: uow resumed duty on the southern coast. In September and October lie took part in fieltl-work which will be described under Section II. After bis return, a,t the end of July, from senice in the I>mien exploring expeditiou, Sullи Assistant H. G. Ogden prm;eeded to Newport, and took in cllarge tlie topography of the eastern side of Rhode Island. His party kept the field until the 1st of DceemlJcr. 111 the course of the season Mr. Ogden ma1)ped thil ground about Sachuest Point, and, iu connection with it, all the surface details found on the western shore of Saughkonnet nhиer, as high up <ts the Stone Bridge road. At the south end of Rhode Island, this party pushed the clctailml survey to the westи ward of Ea.ston's Point and there joined with the work of Assistant Ilarrison. To the northward and westward of Sachuest Point, the work of tho two imrtics joins in the vicinity of Newport. Throughout, the surface feat11res are quite intricate. Amongst the details represented on one of the plane-table sheets turned in by Sub-Assistant Ogden, are the Paradise Rocks. These are four nearly parallel ledges lying north-northeast and south-southwest within a width of about half a mile. The most westerly of the ledges is 173 feet higli, and, in pn:~jecting into the sea, it forms the western side of the bight between Sa.ehuest Point and Easton's Point. On the east side of Saughkonnet River, Mr. Ogden made a topographical survey from Quickи sand Pond westward to the immediate vicinity of Saughkouuet Point, and there connectell with the detailed work of Assistant Hosmer. The aggregate area mapped by Sub-Assistant Ogden is nineteen square miles.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

started on the 21st of January, at the station in North Haven, on one of the Fox Islands in Penobscot Bay. The instrument worked well during the winter and every precaution was used to prevent stoppages. There is good reason to expect a valuable series of obser>ations at this station, the situation, apart from the severity of cold in winter, being particularly favorable. In another place a brief account has been gi\иen of the tide-gauge now in use at North Ha>en. The observer, ]\fr. J. G. Spaulding, has also kept a meteorological register, and during the past year has applied, for the prediction of tides at Boston, the formulre deduced for that port by Professor Ferrel, whose discussion was printed in the appen<lix of my report for 1868. This self-registering tide-gauge at the Doston navy-yard, in the care of .l\Ir. IL Ilowlanu, has l>een in constant operation, except for a few severely cold days of last winter, when it was stopped by ice. The omissions in the record ha>e been supplied from the register of an experimental gauge furnished with glycerine, wllich was in operation near the permanent gauge. Meteorological observations were recorded also at this station. As usual, short series of tidal observations have been made at se>eral other places in the course of the season by the hydrographic parties. These are primarily for the purpose of reducing the soundings, but they also show the tidal relations between the principal stations. SECTION II.

Reoomiaissance near New Haren, Con.necticut.-A strong local interest having been manifested in regard to the extension of the topographical survey of the vicinity of New Hamn beyond tlie limits given on the published chart of the harbor, an examination was clirectml with a vie\V to the identification of stations which had been occupied in the original survey. The chart, moreover, was issuetl in 1846, and it was known that artificial changes made in the yicinity since that date had obliterated some of the points. Assistant R. 1\f, Bache reached New Haven in July, and in the course of the summer visited the principal stations of the triangulation. While so engaged the opportunity was taken to determine the heights of places of special interest in the vicinity of ~ew Han~u. A datum-mark for that purpose was made at the east end of Chapel Street Bridge, where the rise and fall of the tides were recorded during one lunation. Lines were run with the spirit-level and iиeferred to the benchmark~ by which Assistant Bache determined the height of East Rock, \Vest Rock, Rabbit Rock, aud the elevation of other points in the neighborhood of New Ilaven. The results of these measureи ments were furnished to the city engineer and to the leading authorities of Yale College. The triangulation about New Haven was made under the direction of Superintendent Hassler, previous to the re-organization of the survey of the coast. The marks then set at l\fount Carmel and at Dickerman stations were found by Assistant Bache. At several others he was enabled to identify the sites by stones or other marks of reference left in the ground, but in no instance, except at the two stations mentione<l, which are quite near together, could the position formerly occupied by the theodolite be closely ascertained. Nineteen sites in all were carefully examined at which marks had been placed l)y Mr. Hassler. The present condition of the ground at each is stared in the report of Assistant Bache. Suriиey of Lake Champlain, Vertnont, and New York.-Thc survey of the lake was commenced as soon as llOssible after the receipt of the information that it had been included among the duties assigned to the Sa.perintendent. The assistants were detailed on the 25th of August and the parties were organized and at work early in September. Each special branch, as applied practically in the survey of the coast, followed one immediately after the other in the order of its precedence: first the reconnaissance and selection of a site for a base and for a scheme of triangulation; afterwards, in .sucoossion, the measurement of the base; the triangulation; the astronomical determination of latiи tmle and azima.th at one of the trigonometrical points; the telegraphic determination of the apи proximate longitude of the same point by the transmission to Harvard Observatory of the local time at the station ; the topographical delineation of the shores, based upon anti checked by the

triaugulation; and, finally, the bydrography, showing the depth of water in the lake, its periodical rise and fall, tbo reefs, shoals, and dangers to navigation, and the havens and anchorages available when needed. The survey, as far as it is done, embraces the broadest part of the lake, exteuding from Cumberland Head on the New York side to Sherburne Point 011 tho Vermont shore, including the harbors of Plattsburgh and Durlington. The bydrography, being necessarily the last iu order, was confined to the lower section from Plattsburgh Harbor to the island of South Hero. Field-work was suspended towards the close of October, when the time had arrin~l1 for resmning operatio11s on the southern sections of the .Atlantic coast. _ The want of proper facilities, which coulcl not he collected on the cmergeuc_y without considerable delay, retarded the progress of tho field-parties. Ne\'crtheless, the results obtained during tlle short season on the lake have been highly satisfactor.y. They are shown in a general way h,y tile map which accompanies this report as Sketch No. 3. 1\Iention will be made nuder separate heads of the several branches of '\'\Ork and of the assistants engaged in this survey. Reconna-issance.-The reconnaissance was commeuced hy Assistant RD. Cutts, on the 2it,h of August. A careful examination was made of the lake-shores, and of the country in the vicinity of Burlington and Plattsburgh, for a site of the character desired for a lmse-line. To avoid delay in other operations, a short preliminary base was measured for immediate imrposes, aud the reconnaissance was contiuuell subsequently over a more extemlell section 1 for a length of line sufficient for the most accurate surve~'и After a comparison of the relatfre ad\'antages of several sites for a preliminary base, the plateau lying south of Plat.tsburgh was seledetl, the grnun<l heiug high, level, and tolerably free from obstructions, and so situated that it could be introduced directly at one of the most desirable localities for commencing the triangulation. The nodhern terminus is on the United States military reserYation, and the line, passing through the reser>ation am1 across the laml of l\Ir. Bentley Sherman, ends with the plateau itself, near Shennan':s house. The preliminary measurement was made on the 10th of September, and the final measurement between the 12th and 16th, with the six-meter contact-slide apparatus, the rolls of which had been compared with the Coast Survey standard, No.2, a day or two before they were forwarded from Washington. The length of the base, corrected for inclination and temperature, is 1961m.05. The usual monuments were erected and uuclerground marks adjusted and described for the preservation of th.e termini of the line. .Another secondary base was measured on the 19th of September, by S111J-Assistant 1<'. \V. Perkins, on the straight track of the Rutland ltailroad, near the depot at Burlington, fotи the pmpose of starting the topographical survey of' the harbor. This line, i:nnm.76 in length, was meat"mred with a sixty-meter wire, the length of which bad been obtained by means of the base-apparatus. In the latter part of September and during the first week in October, the reconnaissance for a principal base was continued by Sub-Assistant Perkins, untler the direction of Assistant Cutts. The most favorable site found is in Vermont, on the comparatively low ground bordering the lake to the westward of the town of Saint Albans. Its length is ut to 6 miles, and the sit.A, can lJe prepared for measurement at the proper season with but slight expenditure. Sub-Assistant Perkins, Mr. F. Stover, and Mr. B. A. Colonna, temporary aitls, are cornnwncled for intelligent services, in the field-report of Assistant Cutts. Triangulation.-The limits of the triangulation to be executed daring the months of September and October were arranged, under the direction of Mr. Cutts, to include the most important harbors and the routes most used by the commerce of the lake. The scheme and its connectio~s were 1mt in the charge of .Assistants J. A. Sullivan and S. C. l\foCorkle. The former comrnencecl work at Darlington, Vermont, and the latter at Plattsburgh, New York, and the junction of the two series of triangles was made on the intermediate and common line, Stave Island-Point Trembleau. The reconnaissance and tl1e organization of his party were commenced by Assistant SulJiyan 011 the 2d, and the erection of signals on the 6th of September. From the latter date until the 2311 of October the work was prosecuted without interruption, except during the prevalence of high winds and the thick smoke from burning forests on the Ottawa. The following is a synopsis of the results furnished by Mr. Sullivan :

Latitude of Burlington, Vermont.-The astronomical station is on high ground within the city limits, and is connecfod with all the principal stations of the lake-triangulation to tlie westward . .A tcmpomry ohserYatory was completed on tbe 12th of September. Transit No. 12 and zenith. telescope No. 4 were then mounted, each on a brick pier, sunk two foet below the surface, laid in cement, :in1l capped with marble slabs. After careful attention oo tlJcse preliminaries, Assistant A. T. Mosman commenced the observations, and by the lGth of October the latitude and azimuth were determined. Thirty-two stars were obsel"iиed on fi\иe nights for time; one hundred and forty-nine results for latitude were olltained lly observations of :m pairs of stars on nine nights; and, in. addition, two series of observations were made for the value of the micrometer, and three sets for the value of the Jeyel of the zenith telescope. и .A.:foiuth.-The azimuth of the line, "Astronomical station-Juniper Island station," was determined lly 24 sets, each consisting of 12 pointings, 6 on the direct and 6 on the retlected image of Polaris; and to transfer this azimuth oo other lines of the triangulation, 8 sets of angles were taken, each of 12 repetitions. и .Mr. Edwin Smith served as aid, aud Assistant Mosman highly commends him for energy and ability. 1\Ir. Smith also read the chronograph-sheets and mad0 the time-reductions for .Assistant Dean, while that observer was engaged in determining the longitude of the station. Mr. Mosman passell the preceuing winter and s11ring in service with the naval expedition which exploreu the Isthmus of Darien for a ship-canal route. He is now engaged in the determination of latitude and azimuth at stations on the Gulf of Mexico. Longitude Qf Burlиingt.Qn,, l'ermont.-The approximate difference of longitude between the astronomical station at Burlington and Cam bridge observaoory, was determined on the nights of Sept.ember 26 and 28, and October 2. Assistant G. W. Dean reached Burlington on the 19th of September, and occupied the observatory, using the transit set up by Assistant Mosman, who, in conjunction with his aid, Mr. Smith, furnished all the assistance required for determining the longitude. The local time was ascertained each night lly ollserving eight or ten zenith and circumpolar stars, with transit No. 12, the time being recorded on chronograph No. 2, and by the Frodsham break-circuit chronometer, No. 3451, belonging to Cambridge observatory. As soon as the time bad been observed, the break-circuit chronometer was ta.ken to the telegraph-office a.nd there connected in a circuit directly with one of the clocks a.t the Cambridge observaoory. The comparisons of the Burlingt-On chronometer with the Cambridge clock were recorded on the observatory chronograph,

Dorr and Charles Hosmer, reached Burlington, and on tlic l -1th proceeded t-0 Plattsburgh for conference with Assistant Cutts in regar<l to the scale, limits, and necessary checks for the detailed survey. "\Yith a view of running the shore-line eml.Jmccd witl1i11 the scheme of triangulation tlie11 lai<l out and commenced, a secondary base, as alreadjи stated, was measuretl 11ear Burlington.и At this base Mr. Dorr commenced with the plane-table while .Assistant Hosmer started from the Flattaburgh Base; the junction of their respective sunиcys being at two points, one in the vicinity of Port Jackson and the other at rort Trembleau. и.Assistant Dorr had transferreu the charge of his party 011 tlie coast of Maine to Snb-.A.ssista11t H. M. DeWees, on the 5th of September, and on the 19th the topography of Burlington Harbor was commenced. Between that data and the 14th of October the following work was accomplished by the party of Mr. Dorr: Sheet No. 1 contains the shore-line from Shelburne Point to Apple Tree Point, including Juniper Island, a11d Dnnder Rock, .and the docks and breakwater at Burlington ; Sheet No. 2, the shore-line from Apple Tree Point to Colchester Point, including the mouth of Onion River and tw? islands, some ledges, and the vicinits of the new light-house lying off Colchester Point; and Sheet No. 3, the shore-line from Point Tremble.au on the west side of the lake, northwardly, to Port Jackson, including Port Kent, the mouths of the Ausable Ri\иer, aml Garden IslaJHl.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Assistant Hosmer is now on fielu-duty in Section 5, where he had been engaged during the early part of the present year. 'l'l1e preyious work of Assistant Dorr will be mentioned under the heacl of Section IV. Hydrography of Lake O/iamplai1i.-On the 21st of September .A.ssistaut Charles J unken reached Plattsburgh, New York, and, under the direction of the Ilydrographic Inspector, hired a small vessel, which, in the course of a few days, was fittetl for service in taking soundings. The hydrography was at once begun and was prosecuted until the 1st of November. Assistant Junken accurately sounded the middle section of Lake Champlain, or from Cumberland Head southward to Valcour Island, ip.cluding Cumberland Bay and Plattsburgh Harbor. Boisterous weather after the middle. of October interfered with the progress of work, yet the results are very satisfactory, considering ' the time alJotted and circumstances of the season. The depth found in Cumberland Bay and in the lake south of the bay varies from 4 to 8 fathoms, but a mile cast of Valcour Island the depth is 38t fathoms. Soundings in that part of the lake developed a narrow gorge, extending north and south, with bottom consisting of brown clay and mud. The plane of reference ado1>ted by Assistant Junken for the adjustment ofи soumlings on his working-sheet is 2~ inches lower than the lake-level in October last, and 3 inches higher than the water-level of the year 1855, which is believed to be the lowest ever observed.

IIyilrograplty, New York Entrance.-A large part of the working-season, between June and December, was occupiecl by Assistrmt F. II. Gerdes in verifying the positions of sea-marks connected with the navigation of New York Bay and Harbor. At intervals, however, soundings were made, dmиcloping the character of the bottom at Diamond Reef. The water on the Oil Spot and on Flynn's Knoll was found, by careful souutlings, to have shoaled in placeR; and the depths will be changed accordingly on the existing chart. Assistant Gerdes was aided by Mr. C. P. Dillaway. The party used the schooner Dana for transportation. After tnrning in the plane-table sheet containing his SlU\'ey of the Quarantine Islands on the west banks in New York Bay, 1\Ir. Gerdes mapped the ground opposite on the shore of Raritan Bay, including the vicinity of the railroad piers.. He subsequently traced and laid down on another plane-table sheet the line of the New .Jersey Central Railroad, which passes through Bergen Neck, the survey of which was made previous to the location of the line. The hydrographie-sheet containing the soundings made this year at New York Entrance is now on file in the office. BtWJ/8 and sea-marks, New rork Harbor.-ln the course of the season Assistant Gerdes made angular measurements, ancl carefully determined the positions of all the buoys and sea-marks pertaining to the nayigation of the channels into New York Harbor. These include the beacons, light-houses, and buoys in the upper and lower bays, in Raritan Bay, in East River, in Long Island Sound, and in Fisher's Island Sound, the verification being extended eastward as far as New London on the coast of Connecticut. Of these aids to navigation, more than a hundred in number, several have been recently erected, but, from the data supplied by the work of Assistant Gerdes, the positions of all of them will be marked on the respective engraveu charts. The manuscript chart turned in by l\Ir. Gerdes was accompanied by an elaborate report and amp1o notes of the measures taken to secure accuracy in the positions.и Altitudes of prima.ry stations in' Pennsylvania and New Jersey.-The heights, above mean tide, of the primary triangulation points in this section not having been measured, except in a few cases, it wa.S deemed advisable to take up this duty and to commence with the series extending from the Hudson mver to the Chesapeake Bay. From the examinations lately made by Assistant Farley of these stations, it was ascertained that .the usual trigonometrical leveling could not be carried on without re-opening many of the lines at great expense and delay. It was, tberefoi:e,

decided to de~rmine their heig.hts by lines of spirit-leveling from tide-water, in combination with careful observations of the mercurial. barometer, and the entire operation was placed under the charge of Assistant R. D. Cutts. The results have boon highly valuable and interesting, as will be seen by reference to the abstraet of the report of Assistant Cutts, (Appendix No. 8.) The duty of running the lines of level was assigned to Sub~Assistant Charles Ferguson. During the month of June, Mr. Ferguson erected a tide-gange at Keyport, on Raritan Bay, New Jersey, and determined the mean-tide by observations of high and low water during a semi-lmiation. Starting from the half-tide, or common plane of reference, a tidal bench-mark was made in the village of Keyport, and the line was continued through Freehold, Clarksburg, Pemberton, Mount Holly, and Camden, to a tidal station and tide-staff at Gloucester City on the Delaware River, opposite to Philadelphia. From this main line, offsets were made to the primary stations of Beaconhill, Disborough, Stony Hill, and Mount Holly. These different lines were divided into sections, and each section was leveled in one direction, and re-leveled in the other, before proceeding to the next, the entire distance thus leveled being 180 miles. Bench-marks were established at all the principal points on the ronte, and these marks are duly described in the record. The . tracks of the different railroads were used wherever practicable and in the general direction of the line. The instrument and rods employed were of the most approved construction, and the method of adjustment and of observing in the field tested the readings and the even distances between the back and fore sights, and allowed the corrections for the recorded instrumental errors and the want of level at the moment of observing to be comput.ed and applied to the readings on the rod. l\:lr. Ferguson refers to the difficulties encountered as sources of delay, such as the deep sand on some part of the route, and the broken character of the country on the offsets to the trigonometrical stations. The duplication of the records and the computations of the field-work are now in lrnrn1 for completion at an early da;y. Barometrioal observations-Pennsylvania and Ne1c Jersey.-The height above the plane of reference of the three stations of Stony Hill, Mount Holly, and Gloucest.er City, having been obtained by the spirit-level, these heights were used as so many different bases from which to deduce and check the altitudes of the primary stations of Mount Rose, Newtown, Willow Grove, Yard, and Bethel, in Pennsylvania, and of Pine Hill and Lippincott, in New Jersey, obtained by means of the differences which were found to exist between observations, taken simultaneously, of cistern barometers stationed at the known and unknown points. The distances between the stations ranged from ten to twenty-Jive miles, and the observations were made at the most favorable season for - uniformity in the density of the atmosphere. The barometers and psycbrometers, fonr of each, were constructed specially for this work by James Green, esq., of New York. Comparisons, one with the' other, for differences, as well as for personal errors in the observe1'S, were made at Mount Holly before the parties of Assistant Cutts separated for their respective stations, and similar comparisons were instituted on their return. The watch of each observer was also compared and its raoo established, so that the comparatively small corrections for error and rate might be applied in each case in order to insure that all the observations should be taken at the prescribed time. и Five observations were made daily for ten consecutive days at each station, and each observation consisted of three separate readings of the instruments as a precaution against mistakes. The hours seleeted for observing were those oolieved to be, from the experience of reliable persons, the most favot.able for ob.ta.ining the mean temperature of the column of air between the stations. The 00111parisons and observations were commenced July 9th, and ended September 13th. 'l'be observers were Sab-A.ssistant F. H. Agnew, Messrs. Ed win Smith, Charles L. Gardner, and ~. ,A.. OQlonna, aids, and Mr. Charles Wurdemann. Assistant Cutts reports that to their care, ~' aD4 interest in each af the details, and espeeially to the assistance given by Mr. Agnew,

the sueeees of the operation is mainly due. H.Ex.ll2-4

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT O]J'

Reconnaissance, New Jersey.-Between Schenectady, in the State of New York, and Barnegat, on the coast of New Jersey, a. triangulation of the first order is complete from Troy down through the valley of the Hudson River to the vicinity of the Palisades, where it joins with the primary triangulation of the Atlantic coast. Work of the same character not being practicable along the low sea-board of New Jersey, the primary work was deflected at New York City, and thence stretches to the southward and westward to the head of Delaware Bay. Two, however, of the primary stations in New Jersey being not far distant from Barnegat light-house, it is proposed to bring the three points into goedetic connection, and also to connect Schenectady with the triangulation of the Hudson, near Troy, New York. From these operations will result the measurement of anи, arc of three degrees along the meridian, or, the true distance north and south between Schenectady and Barnegat. Assistant W. S. Edwards took the field early in November, 1869, and, after visiting Stony Hill and Mount Holly, made a reconnaissance of the two ridges intervening between those stations and the coast of New Jersey. The object sought was to avoid, if possible, the selection of points on the ridge nearest to Mount Holly, and thus to secure the connection of Barnegat with the least possible number of triangles. He kept the field until the 20th of December, after making notes for guidance in resuming the examination. Mr. Edwards was subsequently on duty in Section V; but before the opening of the season for again taking up work in Section II, he retired from the survey. Under my instructions of June last, Sub-Assistant F. ,V, Perkins was directed to examine carefully all the reports, journals, and sketches heretofore made in reference to this subject and to continue thereconnaissancc. Mr. Perkins reached Mount Holly on the 5th of July and commenced work without delay. High signals were erected at all the known intervisible points and on sevи eral elevations which could be made available for the desired scheme. At these points observations were made from temporary 8ca:ffolds or by climbing, at such times as there waA any probability of seeing, until, by perseverance and careful selection, the duty was successfully a~com plisbed. The scheme embraces four intermediate points between the base and the coast, and the triangles are satisfactory both in shape and size. The work was completed toward the close of August. In his report Mr. Perkins refers to the obstacles caused by smoke which covered the country during July and the early part of August, and to the unbroken second growth of wood and want of roads in the pine region. Early in September Mr. Perkins was assigned to duty on Lake Champlain. He is at present employed in the triangulations in Section IV. inspection of primary stations.-This duty has been Cl~ntinued by Assistant John Farley. The four stations among the earliest determined for the survey of the coast, which could not be identified last season, have been re-exa.mined. Excavations were made at "Bethel" and" Meeting-house Hillt" but without result. At station" Weasel" the surface of the rock was cleaned, but withoЦt finding the copper bolt or the aperture in which it had been fixed, and the inference drawn by Mr. Farley is that as the point is near the edge of the precipice, " the abrasion of storms might have carried it over the precipice." In regard to" Lippincott," directions have been given that when the field is next plowed, a careful scrutiny should be ma.de for the remains of the roots of the different trees to which references were made when the underground mark was deposited. If these clews can be obtained the approximate position of the center of the station will be found, and the cone can then be sought for. Topography of Reed Bay and vicinity, New Jersey.-Plane-table work was resumed on tbe coast of New Jersey, by Assistant C. M. Bache, early in July, and was continued until the 3dofDecember. In that interval the survey was ext.ended from Great Bay southward to a line joining Absecom and Atlantic City. Westward the topography includes the road passing southward from Leeds Point. The district represented by the plane-table sheet is nearly filled with small bays, which are aftect.ed by the influx of tidal waters at New Inlet and Absecom Inlet. In the vicinity at which the tides meet the work proved to be difficult, the marsh being soft and indeterminate in outline. N <>twithst.a.nding the disadvantages due to the extreme heat of the sum.mer, three hundred miles of waterline were traced in the course of the season within an area of forty-three square miles. The working. sheet includes, also7 ten miles of road.

Sub-Assistant H. W. Bache was attached to the party and assisted in the field-work. In pa~!!и ing to and fro to define the numerous water-channels, the operations of Assistant Bache were faeilitated by the use of a barge of light draught and adapted in other respects to sen'ice on the coast of New Jerse:y. This party had been previously employed in Section V. Tidal observations.-The permanent series of tidal observations in New York Harbor has been kept up, with the self-registering gauge on Governor's Island, by Mr. R. T. Bassett, an experienced observer, who has also, from time to time, registered day-tides with a box-gauge at the Hamilton Avenue Ferry, in Brooklyi;.. A few years more will complete this important series, and furnish the means for final discussion, and data for predicting the tides at the port of New York. SECTION III.

Pri11iary triangulation near lV a11kington, District of Oolumbia.-After his return from Section Vin June, Assistant C. 0. Boutelle resumed, at Peach Grove, Virginia, the observations which he had commenced at that station before the close of the preceding season. Owing to the extreme _heat of July, bnt few observations were possible in that month. The angular measurements due at Peach Grove were completed near the middle of August. Soon afterwards the party was transferred to Maryland Heights, near Harper's Ferry. There, in addition to the measurement of angles, by Assistant Boutelle and his aid, Mr. A. H. Scott, latitude and azimuth observations were made by Sub-Assistant F. Blake, jr. After turning in the astronomical records Mr. Blake was detached from the party, with permission ro join the second naval exploring expedition which sailed for the Isthmus of Darien in Decemи her last. Triangulation. Chesapeake Bay and James River.-At the date of my last report the base .of rnrification at the entrance to the James River had been measured and the observations for connecting it with the triangulation of Chesapeake Bay had been commenced by Assistant R E. Halter. During the month of November, 1869, the work advanced under the temporary charge of Sub-Assistant F. ,V. Perkins. In the following month the schooner Bowditch was repaired and fitted for the use of the party, after which Assistant Halt.er resumed work at Sewall's Point, and by March 21st the connection of the base with the primary triangulation was effocted on the line Back River light-house-Cape Henry light-house, and the agreement (10110 0 0 ) was entirely satisfactory. On the completion of this duty Mr. Halter returned to the base and carried the triangulation up the James River, stopping on the 1st of August at the line, Jamestown-Jones. The work was resumed on the 1st of October, and on the 1st of November, the date of his report, Mr. Halter had erected signals to carry the triangulation as far as the month of the Chickahominy. The work. was considerably retarded during the winter by high winds, and somewhat by ice, and, during July, by sickness in the party. The statistics for the season are as follows : J,ight-houses occupied ....................... - - ................ _.. . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 Light-houses used as signals - ....и....и.....и.и.ии.и......... __ ......... _.. и 7 Si gna.ls erected и . . . и . и и . . . . . . . . . . и . .. . и . и и . и и . . . .. и и . . . . . . . . . . . и . и и . . и и и. , . и 25 Stations occupied ...и.... - ......и - . - ............. - - - - ...... - и . . . и и . . . . и .. . . и 22 Number of observations .......................................................... 7, 564

The progress made and character of the work executed by Assistant Halter are highly satisfactory. His party will continue in field-service during the winter.

Donn, under tm advantage of a favorable winter, made a la.rge advance in the survey. of the outer coast of Virginia., north of Oape Charles. Before the opening of spring the plane-table survey included the ground between Chesape&ke Bay and the Broad Water, the limits north and south being East,. ville ao.d the head. of Magotby Bay. Subsequently it was extended northward and eastward, a.nd has taken in the channels, islands, and marshes which mark this part of the Atlantic coast. Fre-

quent storms much interrupted the progress of wor~ along the sea-board. Of the vicinity of the Broad Wa.ter a sheet remains to be finished, which will include the northern part, and on this Mr. Donn and his aid, Mr. L.B. Wright, are now engaged. The survey was suspended during the summer, when the party was engaged on another part of the coast, as mentioned under Section I. A. synopsis of the statistics of work done on the coast of Virginia, appended to the field-report of Assistant Donn, shows an aggregate of 359 miles of shore-line traced, and 144 miles of road, within a mapped area of 147 square miles. Bydr<>graphy of the Broail Water, Virginia, and of the Chesapeake estuaries, Maryland.-With data furnished by the plane-table party, Sub-Assistant W. W. Harding commenced soundings in и, the latter part of July, and by the end of September developed the Broad Water, on the outer coast of' Virginia, within the limits of the topographical survey. The h_ydrographic party in the schooner Hassler was previously at work in the Maryland branches of Chesapeake Bay. More than eighty of the estuaries were traced in outline and sounded in theи course of the season by SubAssistant Harding and his aid, Mr. A. F. Pearl. These include the lesser rivers, as the Chester, Saint .Michael's, the Ohoptank, and the Sassafras Rivers. Eastern Bay, one of the larger branches of the Chesapeake, was sounded out, as were also the Bush Ri>er and the Gunpowder. The shoreline survey and the hydrography were in all cases ex.tended to the head of the tide. No intervals occurred in the progress of the work during last winter, except such as were necessary for procuring provisions for the crew. In the very numerous sites in which the operations were carried on, an aggregate of nearly two hundred miles of shore-line was traced by the hydrographic party. The tides were observed as usual, when needful for the adjustment of the soundings. Mr. Harding closed on the 9th of December in order to report progress in the work now under notice. The aggregate statistics are as follows: Signals erected. _. _.и __ .... _ . _. _ . __ .. __ ............. - ....и _..и _. , _. и и . . . и 65 Angles measured __ .... _...... _......и. _и... _....и..... __ .....и..... - . . . . 286 l\Jiles run in sounding. _........ _....и.и...............и........... _... - . . 518 Number of soundings ..... , ....... ___ и.....и... _.... - ........ииииии. _. . . и 31, 567 The party in the schooner Hassler is now engaged on the Chesapeake indentations that remain to be defined in order to complete the hydrography of the bay. Magnetic and astronomical obser'1ations.-In order to preserve the continuity of the series of observations beguu in January, 1867, and for the accumulation of data bearing on the secular change, Assistant Charles A. Schott observed in June last, and deduced the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity at a station m his own grounds to which the instruments were transferred in advance of the removal of the Coast Sarvey Office. The new office-site not admitting of the er.ection of a suitable oat-building, the series will be continued annually at the station occupied this year, which is at the southeast corner of the iut;ersection of Second street east with 0 street south, and about five hundred yards ea.st of the Coast-Survey Office. At the request of Brigadier-General Albert J. Myer, Chief Signal-Officer of the Army, Mr. Schott assisted during several days in August in organizing the system by which observations ot the waather generally, and reports on storms since that time, have been made public for the benefit of commerce. In October he accompanied me in the voyage to Europe, and took charge of the party details for observing, under my immediate direction, the phenomena of the solar eclipse of December last. The observations made by my party at Catania, on the island of Sicily, will be discusi!ed. in a subsequent report to the Department. After bis return from Europe, Assistant Schott resumed his place in the office as chief of the Computing Division. Tidal observations....-At Old Point Cotn.fort, Virginia, observations. were continued with the self-registering tide-gauge by Mr. E. F. Krebs until the 1st of May, when he resigned. !Бr. W. T. Bodell is now in charge of the station. This is one of our most extended series of observations, but, unfortunately, parts of it a.re imperfect in continuity. Last winter one of the severe storms swept a.way or rendered useless a.ll parts of the apparatus that were under water. With these drawbacks, however, the serie&,is valuable, and will furnish important results by dieeussion. Thiи Rtation is, of nooessity, much exposed to the force of the sea.

Hydrograph.y, coast of North, Carolina.-While the steamer Bibll was under repairs iu June, .Acting Master Robert Platt, United States ~avy, assistant Coast Survey, employed a sufficient force from his crew, in charge of Sub-Assistant Gershom Bradford, to set up signals along the coast of North Carolina, to the northward of Cape Hatteras. The coast-bydrography was then resum(l(l abreast of Albemarle SoUDd, and was иextended soutlnvard to Loggerhead Inlet. As repregented by the chart, the depth is uneven; soundings were cousequently made more numerous than is usual in developing bottom along the open sea-coast. Off Bodies Island shoals were found giving only 4! and 5 fathoms of water, while the depth between tlrnm and the coast is 12 fathoms and in some cases more. In reference to that >icinity, Acting l\<laster Platt says: "It would be a hard matt~r to give sailing directions; I can. only recommend tlle constant use of the lead. No part of the c-0ast is more in need of a light-house, for the laud at Bodies Islaml is so low that it cannot be seen on the clearest day from vessels more than four or five miles off, and the soundings being irregular, would deceive the most watchful navigator." It is suggested in the same report, as a collateral advantage, that a light-house on Bodies Island would serve as a guide to the Wimble Shoals, which lie at the only bend made by the Atlantic coast between Cape Henry and Cape Hatteras. Mr. J. B. Adamson aided in the hydrographic; operations. This work was prosecuted until the close of September. The party had been previously engaged on the Florida reef, and will be employed there during the present winter. Further reference to the service of Acting :Master Platt will be made under the head of Section YI. Sub-Assistant Bradford has been assigned to duty on the Pacific coast. In October, soundings were resumed on the coast of North Carolina, at New lnlet, so as to join with the work which was suspended at Loggerhead Inlet in the preceding month. Bad weather oocasion.ed much delay in pushing the hydrogi-aphy southward. Twice the steamer was driven back to her anchorage in. Hatteras Inlet, and was there detained twent.y-two <lays. Acting :Master Platt took the first favorable opportunity and pushed the coast-soundings southward to Cape Hatteras, closing the work late in November. Close to the shore some few small shoals were developed below Loggerhead Inlet, but they are not in the ordinary track of vessels that pass coastwise. The bottom as shown by the chart is remarkably even between New Inlet and Cape Hatteras. Changes have occurred since the issue of the chart of Hatteras Inlet, and it is advised, in the report of Acting Master Platt, that vessels should not attempt to enter without a pilot, the anchorage iuside being narrow and the current very strong. The resulting chart is represented by the following statistics: Miles run in sounding . - .и..... - .и.и - ..... _..... _...... _.......... _. . . . . . 919 .Angles for position .и.. - ...

A. l!'air1ield, have ma.de excellent progress during the past year. The success of the party is due to the very favorable weather and to the good judgment shown in the arrangement of tb.e work as to precedence of locality in regard to time. Assist.ant Fairfteld reached New Berne on the 14th of December, and after attending to the necessary repairs of the schooner Dana, proceeded to the Sound in the week following. During the months of January, February, and March, the usually boisterous season in the Sound, he completed the triangulation of Pamplico River, from its entrance at Judith Island to the head of uaviga.tion at the oowu of W a.shington, a distance of 40 miles, and also the triangalation of South Crook. Sub-Assistant F. W. Perkins efficiently assisted in this work. The computations were

kept up with the progress in the field, and, on the 7th of April, the results were supplied for the use of the topographical and sounding parties. The next duty was in the Sound. Observa.tioQs required at the primary stations Brant Island, Brant Island light-house, and Royal Shoal lightи house, upon Swan Quarter Signal, were completed by the 22d of April. The measurement of the base of verification, the site of which was selected in the previous season in the vicinity of Ocracoke Inlet, was next taken up. The base apparatus, sent from the office in Washington, in charge of R. L. Hawkins, esq., was shipped at New Berne on the 5th of May, and on the 9th the schooner was moored close иto the intended line. Between that date and the 24th the line was traced and measured, the ends were securely marked, and signals were ' erected. The base is situated on the sand-fiat forming the seaward side of Portsmouth Island, immediately south of Ocracoke Inlet, and extends from the village of Portsmouth to Whalebone Inlet. It; length, corrected for the inclination and temperature of the rods, is 9,038-39m, (5.6 miles.) The measurement was made with the six-meter sliding-contact apparatus, according to the method heretofore used iu the survey, and with all the care and precision prescribed for the operatioQ. The contacts were adjusted by Assistant Fair.field in the measurement, and he observed also the inclinations of the rods, and the temperatures. Sub-Assistant Perkins kept the rooord of the operations and made the vertical offsets. The alignment of the bars was made by Mr. W. B. Fairи field, temporary aid. At the close of May, the schooner Druia, with the base apparatus ou board, was sent to Baltimore, and the duplicate records, &c., to the office at v;r ashington. The originals and computations followed early in July.

W. Dorr resumed the plane-table survey in January, using, as heretofore, the hull of the steamer Hetzel for the transportation needed in his operations. The vessel was towed from New Berne to the mouth of Pamplico River, by Captain Carson, of the revenue-steamer I. I. Stevens, which courtesy is duly acknowledged in the report of Assistant Dorr. The topography of the western shore of Pamplico Sound had been advanced last season from the mouth of the Neuse River to Pamplico light-house. There the party started for the plane-table survey of Pamplico River. By reason,.bowever, of its width, and of the extent of the branches of the river, it was found impracticable to include much of the northern shore on the first working-sheet. On the south side the shore-line was traced from Pamplico Point upward to Lee's Creek, and also the adjacent topography, marked by the branches of the lower part of Pamplico River. Of these the principal are Oyster Creek, Goose Creek, Bond's Creek, and near it South Creek. Of the upper side the survey includes the mouth of Pungo River, the largest estuary of the Pamplico, and also North Oreek and Sinclair's Creek. Several of the streams shown on the plane-table sheets are navigable, and in particular South Creek and Bond's Creek, on which last is the growing settlement known as Oregon .M:llls. Sub-Assistant H. :M. De Wees was attached to the party at the outset of the season. During his absence of some weeks in the spring the work was continued by.Mr. Dorr, without aid. He was rejoined by Mr. De Wees before the middle of April, and the survey was pushed until the 15th of June.

party; and, under Section II, of topography in which Mr. Dorr was engaged. He is now in the field in Section rv. Hydrography of Pamplico Sound, North Carolina.-In four different sit.es the bydrograpby of Pamplico Sound has been -advanced by the party of Assistant F. F. Nes. Long Bay has been sounded, and the month of Pamplico River. Brant Island Shoal bas been developed, and additional soundings have been made to the southward of Royal Shoal light-house in Pamplico Sound. Work in this section was resumed on the 28th of December, 1869, with the schooner Arago and steam-launch &uppernong. After prosecuting the soundings for a period of about ten days, the party was transferred to Cape Fear entrance and there engaged for a fortnight in a special survey, which will be noticed separately. Resuming work, at the end of .Tanuary, in Pamplico Sound, the hydrography was prosecut.ed vigorously as far as the conditions of the weather would permit. Early in February, during a gale, the launch was sunk and the port anchor of the Arago was lost. Bad weather was frequent until April, but by improving short opportunities Assistant Nes completed soundings between Point of Marsh and Portsmouth, North Carolina, by the 6th of that month, and extended the hydrography of the sound so as to include Long Bay and the Thoroughfare, to Core Sound. The vicinity of Brant Island Shoal was sounded by the 13th of April, and between thatdate anБl the 4th of June, soundings, continuous with the general hydrography, were made at the entrance of Pamplico River, the work there being carried as far in as Indian Island. Before reи turning the vessel to New Berne, Mr. Nes ran several lines of soundings in the quarter, which will be developed by the hydrographic operations now in progress and to be continued during the winter. Mention was made under Section I of the operations of this party during the summer and autumn.

HydrogrO![Jhy of Cape Fear (u:estern) entrance, Notиtli Carolina.-Tbe western entrance to the Cape Fear River was sounded in January, 1870, at the instance of public authorities, in advance of their contemplated action for the improvement of the navigation. The results show that the bar has moved inwards and that the Rip Channel bas deepened since the year 1865, and, on the contrary, that the Bald-Head Channel is now almost entirely closed. The changes noticed, and a copy of the chart made in" January, were communicated early in the following month, for public purposes, to the Hon. J. C. Abbott, United States Senator from North Carolina. This work was done by the party of Assistant Nes, as already stated, during the interval in the regular operations iQ this section.

ATLANTIC COAST AND SEA-WATER CHANNELS OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, INCLt:'DING SOUNDS, HARBORS, AND RIVERS. (SKETCH No. 7.)

Reconnaissance nea.tи Winyah Bay, BC>uth Carolina.-The secondary triangulation of the coast between Charleston and Winya.h Bay was made in 18U7. With a. view to commence the detailed survey, Assistant W. S. Edwards received instructions at the close of January to proceed to Chariest.on and examine the stations, and, if additional points were necessary, to supply them. With a small :fishing-smack, chartered for the purpose, the examination was conducted, and closed on the 15th. of April Of thirty.four stations visited, Mr. Edwards i~entified the marks at seventeen. Four of the remaining stations had been washed away, and at two others batteries. had been erected in the course of the war. Another of the stations was obliterated by the erection of large salt-works.

32

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Assistant Edwards reported that the points recorded, all of which were re-marked and lie. scribed by him, are so situated as to afford a basis for the topography without additional triangulation. Before leaving the field he made a sketch of the inland passage from Breach Inlat to Cape Roman, showing the anchorages, the channels to the stations and landings, the local names, &c. This has been deposited in the office for future use. Previous reference to the services of Mr. Edwards was made under the head of Section II. Primary triangu"la'tion near Savannali, Georgia.-During the spring Assistant 0. 0. Boutelle continued the preparation of lines below Port Royal for extending the primary triangulation southward to the Savannah River. The last avenue was cleared early in May, for bringing Tybee ligh,tи house into sight from a station on Danfuskie Island. With the theodolite Mr. Boutelle then occupied in succession five stations which he had previously rendered i ntervisible, and made the usual number of measurements for horizontal angles. The Exchange, in the city of Savannah, was occupied as a station, and finally Tybee light-house, where the connection was perfected in the geodetic work between Charleston Harbor and the Savannah River. Mr. Boutelle closed operations in this section early in June, and then took up duty in Section III. Special difficulties have attended the primary work on the coast and sea islands of South Carolina. The triangulation had been carried easterly from the Edisto base to Charleston, and westward to Port Royal Bay, when the breaking out of the war in 1861 suspended all operations not absolutely essential for naval or military purposes. In its previous progress, the work, by reason of the flatness of the ground, had been a laborious operation, and at best only allowed a system of single triangles, with no quadrilaterals. Artificial elevations were required at every station to overcome the natural curvature, and these served also to keep the lines of sight above the stratum of air, which was generally disturbed close to the surface of the earth. Nearly every line had to he traced throughout its entire length with a transit instrument, to insure that it encountered no insuperable obstacle, such as a house or a grove of ornamental trees. A venues through pine and other forest trees were required. These varied from mere "margins" of timber, surrounding cottonfields, to unbroken lines of forest, from one to seven miles long. All of the lines were opened to a width of twenty feet. The secondary triangulation was made to precede the primary and to exhibit for it the lines of least cutting. I1ater in the work, the topography went also in advance, and thus the degree of labor encountered in earlier years in selecting the primary stations has been much lessened. On resuming the main triangulation after tbe war, it was decided to extend it south of Port Royal Bay and to close for the present at Savannah. Tliis completed schetge connects the astronomical station at Breach Inlet, near Charleston, with the -Savannah Exchange, which is also an astronomical point, and verifies the two secondary base-lines, which were measured for the surveys of Charleston Harbor and Savannah River. In the concluding season of the primary work, observing tripods and !caffolds were erected at four stations, exclusive of other artificial elevations, as the Savannah Exchange and Tybee ligltt, which, as hefom stated, were occnpiecl as primary points. Angular measurements were made during the season at twenty stations, including secondary points, and 137 angles were determined by 5,702 obsel'Vations. The instruments used were the twelve-inch Gambey theodolite, (No. 16,) and the eight-inch Gambey, (No. 24.) Mr. Boutelle also иmade the usual magnetic observations, with Coast-Survey theodolite-magnetometer, No. 3. The chief labor of the work, however, has been in rendering the primary stations intel'Visible. In the season of 1869-'70, this service occupied five months, while the primary angles observe.d through the avenues thus opened were measured in six weeks. Thus the preliminary labor required a.bout three-fourths of the whole time employed in the triangulation. The results of tlie primary work show a fair degree of prooisi-0n in the secondary bases above referred to, and prove also that the seeondary triangulation which has passed along the coast of Georgia may be confidently relied on, when checked by occasional astronomical stations and secondary base-lines. и Topogm.pkgof Br~ad Ritier, &tt,th Carolina, and BatJannak Riwr.-The working.force of .Assistant Charles Hosmer was dispatched from Baltimore in the schooner G. M. Bache, on the loth of Deи

cember, 1869, but the vessel was disabled by se\иere gales at sea, which delayed her sailing from Norfolk until the 10th of January. To the hardships thus entailed was added, on the passage southward, the serious illness of the captain, making it necessary to put into New Berne, from whence the schooner finally sailed, and reached Savannah ou th!l 2d of February. Tue topography was taken up without delay, and was prosecuted uutil the end of April. Assistant Hosmer first mapped the northern side of the Savannah riYer, opposite to Elba Islitn1l, so as to iuclmle tl1e upper waters of Wright's River. To the northward and eastward he snbseqnently 8urveye<l the vicinity of Bluffton and below it for smиeral miles the courses of J\fay Hiver and Macka_y's Creek; the first a tributary of Calibogne Sound, and the last, of Broad River. After laying up ti.Jc vessel near Savannah, :.\Ir. IlosmPr re1 orted at the office, and was assigned to duty in two of the northern sections.

With stores on board, the vessel was taken to Fernandina and partially refitted for the sen-ice of the season. Assistant Bache, with his aid, .Mr. Edwin Smith, then proceeded to fill in topographical details in the vicinity of Saint Amlrew's Sonnd, the 15hore-lines haying lJeeu traced in a preYiouR season. Sub-Assistant H. W. Bache joined the party early in April, and assisted in the field-work until the completion of the detailed survey, whicb was closed late in June. The topographical features within an aggregate area of twenty-five miles were mapped ou tho plane-tahlc sheet. .A.ssistant Bache then laid up the vessel near Savannalt, and, after lti;; return to the )forth, engaged in planetable duty in Section II, as already mentioned. и The survey of this season by the party on the coast of Georgia includes part of Jekyl Island ; the necks of land between the Great anq Little Satilla Rivers, and the ground adjacent to the passages that form the water-communication between Saint Simon's Sound and Cumberland Sound.

Of these the principal are known as <.:nmberland Rirnr, Brick Kiln River, Crooked River, and King's Bay. All of them form parts of the tide-watl'r communication between Saint Andrew's :::found and Cumberland Sound, inside of the sea coast. Steamers plying between Savannah and Florida constantly pass by the interior route. и This survey was made with the schooner Ottswell. For the nse of the bydrographic party, .:lfr.

Rydrograpliy of Saint AugusUne Harbor, Florida.-In order to determine the character of the changes which have occurred within the last teu ;years, the bar aml harbor of Saint Augustine were sounded, in the course of the present season, by a party in charge of Sub-Assistant Horace Anderson. The entering channel was found to have shifted northward nearly a mile. .As the entrance now ii;, vessels drawing as much as fifteen feet can enter at high water. Mr. Anderson commenced this survey in the middle of Janmtry. Three tide-gauges were set up; one at Saint Augustine, on the steamboat wharf; another in the river, north of the city ; and the third at a point near l\latanzas Inlet Observations were recorded for sixty days with the tide-gauge in the harbor, and for short periods with the others. After concluding work on the bar and in the harbor, S!Jb-Assistant Anderson extended soundings to include about fifteen mile8 of the course of North River, above Saint Augustine, and the Matanzas River as far southward as Matanzas Inlet.

ered with a heavy growth of mangrove and other trees. Most of the keys of Barnes' ::Sound are ~urrounded by extensive mud-flats, or by water so shallow as to make the approach to them very difficult. Some of the keys, however, are covered witll water at high tides. One Irnndrer1 and thirty-six of them are shown on the sheet which bas been returned to the office. This plaue-taLle survey comprised also the northwest side of' Key Largo. In connection with the field-work the party of l\fr. Oltmanns completed tlie hyrlrography within the limits of his topographical sheet. The operations were carried on onir an area of more than three hundred square miles.

The schooner .Agassiz, used for the service, required extensi\e repairs in February, and the progress of the party was, in consequence, somewhat delayed. The health of Assistant Oltmanns being greatly enfeebled by disease, a large part of the work was done by Mr. Eugene Ellicott, his aid, t.o whom lVIr. Oltmanns garn credit иfor efficient senices. After closing the work in l\Iay, the party was transferred to Section Y III, and instruetions for op(~ra tions dul'ing the summer were issued. But the health of Mr. Oltmanns entirely failed before tlle esrvice could be takea up. His lingering illness was closed by ueath on the 2d of September. In .July 1fr. Ellicott was assigned to topographical duty in Section I. _Hydrography of the Flor,ida Reej:-Smmdings were resumed early in February at the western end of the Florida Reef by the hydrographic party in the steamer Bibb, under commanu of Acting Master Robert Platt, United Stl1tes mwy, Assistant in the Coast Snnиey. In the course of a few days a tideи gauge was set up, and also two large signals to guide in sounding bl\lfond the Marquesas. The running of the lines, however, was postponed for a fortnight, the calm in that interval being chosen by the steamer for towing the United States Monitor Saugus to Havana. Ilsdrograpllic work was resumed without further delay, and continued in the .vicinity of the Quicksands uutil the 26th of March, when, by official request, the Bibb sailed for Havana and Sauto Domingo, with naval dispatches. This duty employed the party until the 18th of April, when the ship was again coaled at Key West and proceeded to her station near the Marquesas. The adjunctis provided as signals were further improved by the use of two iron buoys, moored so as to be secure against the force of the wind or the sea. At these, boats were stationed, the sails and flags of whiclt were observed on by the aids of the llarty, while the steamer was used in sounding. By means of the signals erected and the subsidiary expedients just referred to, a very difficult piece of work, made so by the absence of any natural leading mark on land, was successfully accomplished. On the outer reef, off the Marquesas Island, Acting Master Platt found a rock -with but 12 teet of water on it. Three miles north of tbe Quicksands, a reef six miles long was developed, the depth on the reef varying generally from llil to 18 feet, but on the western end the depth found was only 8 feet. Deep water is found very close to this reef on tl!e north side. It is recommended in the report of .Acting Master Platt that vessels should not pass within the 10-fathom currn on the north side of the Quicksands, as marked on the chart of this \"icinity. On the extreme end of the Quicksands the soundings made this season show that there is a large shoal with as little as 6 feet of water on it. The position of Rebecca Shoal, to the west ward of the .Marquesas, was carefully determined by help of means already described; and as the expedients used farntи convictions in regard to acca.racy, the position so ascertained will be adopted, though somewhat different from the one heretofore assigned. Isaac Shoal, near the Uebecca, was also carefully sounded aml deterи minoo in position. Currents in the vicinity of the Marquesas were observed at six stations by the hydrographic party. The general statistics are a.s follows:

The schooner Torrey was employed for the accommodation and transportation of the llarty. On reaching Saint Andrew's Bay, Mr. McCorklc made a reconnaissance for tlie purpose of Eelecting a site for the proposed base, and finally concluded to measure a line upon the outer beach and to transfer the ends to higher ground. The base consisted of two separate lines, not differing greatly in direction. The measurement was made in January, with the four-meter sliding-contact apparatus. The deduced length of the base is 3,4и14m.7. It connects with the triangulation by means of two lines opened through tbe woolls. In these operations, :Mr. :Mccorkle was assisted by ]\fr. Iardella.

Pew of the points determined before the war could be found. In order to replace them Assistant \Vebber started at a well-aRcertain~d lfne, (joining Fort Wood flag-staft with East Rigolcts ligllt,) and with ti.le tl1eodolite determined the positions of five high Rcaffold signrtls whicll bad bepn set np by the party undPr bis direction. lntermediate points were also determined for use in the soundings.

In summing up the general iиesnlts of tu is work, the following remarks are malle iu tile report of Assistant \Yebber: "The depth of water in Lake Borgne is from 8 to 12 feet, the bottom mostly sticky. There is a slioal a mile and a half \\'ille, with oul5и Gz feet at mean low water, at the east<>rn entrance to the Higolets.

Between that date and tbe end of l\iay, the triangulation along the wes~ side of the sound was extended from last year's Jimits northward until it joined the work previously done. Two plane-table sheets were completed, making the topography continuous with former work. The triangulation of the l\Iississippi River was carried up from the station Coquille to Grand Prairie. A plane-table sheet of the river banks below the forts was finished, and another, including Forts }forgan and Jackson and the route of tile proposed ship-canal. иwhile the scltooner was being laid up, an examiqation was ma.de of the condition of the trigonometrical stations establislled in the vicinity of New Orleans, in 1858.

Special hydrogrnphic scrl'ice in tlte West lndies.-In June, 1870, the '\Yest India and Panarna _ Telegraph Company's fleet arri\иed at Kingston, Jamaica, with sub-marine cables intended to join ' the priucipal islamls of tlle \Ve8t Indies. H. M. S. Vestal had been detailed by the British Government to assist the company. The courtesy due from our Government was recognized by the Honomble Secretary of tlw N:n-y, in the dispatch of the United States steamer Yantic to aid Sir Uharles 13right, chief engineer of the company, as far as possible in his undertakings. In the same spirit further co-operation was tenuered in the assignment of Assistant J. S. Bradford to act, if needful, as na-.igator of the telegraph fleet. This was done on the suggestion of the president of the International Ocean Telegraph Company, General W. F. Smith. By previous appointment 1\fr. Bradford reported to Sir Charles Bright at Kingston, and accompanied the expedition fo the caule-sliip Suffolk. The line 011 the south coast of Cuba, from Batabano to Santiago de Cuba, was successfully laid in the latter part of July; but many faults, due to the nature of the bottom, occupied the greater part of the month of August, for perfecting the telegraph circuit through the caule. In the manufactory the cables had been tested at a temperature of 7so, which was supposed to be higher than the ultimate temperature of tlle lines when submerged in the West India waters. It may be so in the deeper waters of the Caribbean Sea, but while the cable was taking its place in the shallow hay near the Isle of Iиiues, JUr. Bradford found a temperature at the bottom of 33~0, and mиerywhere along that part of the course temperatures above 80░. The highest temperature was found in se\иenteen fathoms off the north point of the Great Bank of Jardinillos. Instrurnent8, intended for the use of Assistant Bradford in deep-sea observations, had been provided by Sir Charles Bright, but remained on board of the steamer Yantic. That vessel, when the telegraph fteet l'eacbed Kingston, was sounding for tlie line between Jamaica and Sain.t Thomas, and left Santiago de Cuba before the arrival of Mr. Brailford at that point. A short time after the Yautic received special orders, and having accomplished the part assigned in the preliminary arrangements of Sir Charles Bright, sailed for Samana Bay, without opportunity to transfer the deepsea instruments to another vessel. 'While he was associated with the cable fleet, Mr. Bradford made for the chief engineer of the telegraph company two largиe charts of the coast of Cuba and Jamaica, and corrected many inaccuracies in the published charts. l\Iany of the Ca;rs iu the labyrinth traversed by the telegraph line bebvccn Batabano and Cienfuegos bad been wrongly marked in position; and the shore-line of the south side of Cuba, from Point Sau Juan to Cape Cruz, was found to be exceedingly erroneous. Assistant Bradford notes the great depth of water between Cuba and Jamaica, and the abruptness of descent from the shore of the first-named island. On the line going due south, and about forty miles from Santiago de Cuba, the depth is 1,750 fathoms, and probably greater depths can be found between the two _great islands named. Across this deep-sea chasm Sir Charles Bright successfully laid a cable joining Santiago de Cuba with a station in Holland Bay, or, as marked on the charts, Plantain Garden Harbor, ou the northeast side of Jamaica. A third cable was to pass from Kingston to Colon, (.Aspinwall,) a point on the south shore of the Caribbean Sea. As the northeast trade-winds blow there with considerable force, it was with due foresight decided to take the cable to Colon, and to submerge it while passing northward, the vessel then being more readily stopped, in case of a break or fault. Assistant Bradford, on board of the Vestal, which was the leading vessel in the absence of the Yantic, accompanied the expedition to Colon, and took part in making observations for latitude and longitude. The Vestal not being provided with any special means for dredging or for procuring deep-sea temperatures, Mr. Bradford took passage at that port on the 20th of October for New York, and reported at Wasbington, after an absence of five months. He was soon after assigned to regular bydrographic dnty, in Section VIII, descriptiom1 of which will be given in my next annual report.

Triangulation of the Santa Ba1иbara C!tannel, Ca7'ifornia.-At the date of my last report Assistи ant George Davidson was in the field determining latitude and azimuth and connecting a point in the triangulation of the Santa Barbara Channel with San Francisco for longitude by telegraphic observations. For this purpose he occupied the station Buena Vista in the city of Los .Angeles, and joined it with the main line of telegraph which passes to San Francisco. At station Santa Barbara. he observed 170 additional measures of horizontal angles with the 18-inc11 theodolite; 41 measures for azimuth upon a and /. lirsIB l\finoris and 51 Cepbei, and 126 transits of stars, with the Davidson meridian-instrument. From that station and Hills, the positions and eleyations of seYen peaks of the Santa Barbara Mountains were determined. Thirty-two double altitudes upon 15 objects were recorded from readings with the three-inch theodolite No. 3104. Station Hills was occupied !Jy the aid, l\fr. S. R. Throckmorton, jr., with the 8-inch Gambey theodolite No. 44, to determine the positions of the n10untains and tlie azimuth mark. Before leaving that 1иicinity ::Mr. Davidson furnished for the trustees of tl1e town of Santa Barbara true meridian marks from the station Santa Barbara, as means of refcrm:1cc for the county surveys. Station Pelican was examined and identified, and the azimuths determined there were connected with the main triangulation. At station San Buenaventura .Assistant DaYidson matle 2i8 ob1'!t'rnltions for latitude with the zenith telescope No. 1, upon 91 stars in 39 pairs aml triplets. Of this series 6 pairs were also observed at Santa Barbara. With the meridian instrument, li J transits were recorded in observing 60 stars; 297 measures of horizontal angles were made with the 18-inch theotlolite :N' o. 4; and 497 measures for azimuth upon I. Ursm Minoris ancl 31 Ct,phci. The azimuth mark was connected directly with the main station, Santa Barbara. Assistant Davidson, in making azimuth observations, noti<:ed sen:;i!Jle chaugc:; of lC\иel and also twisting of the point of bluff on which the triangulation station was placed in 18.37. His remarks on the changes are given in the .Appendix. .At San Buenayentura a station was selected on the mountain-flank, from which obsenиations could be made upon the island of Santa Barbara. The height of station San Buenaventura was determined, and 28 double altitudes were observed upon 13 objects with the 3-iuch theodolite for the approximate elenltion of the adjacent triangulation stations. At Dominguez Hill station in the Los Angelos Plains l\Ir. Da,idson observed for azimuth, and instituted a series of latitude observations with zenith telescope :N'o. 1 and the Davidson meridian instrument upon the same pairs of stars, in order to compare the capabilities of the two instruments. With the zenith telescope 173 observations were nuulc on 74 stars in 34 pairs and triplets; and with the meridian instrument 134 observations upon the same stars. Notes were made here, as at the other stations, upon the relative magnitudes of the stars of the latitude lists. иwith the meridian instrument 292 observations were made upon a Urs::e Minoris near western elongation for the value of the micrometer-screw; 113 transits were obserYed upon 34 stars; 460 measures for azimuth upO:!J. a Ursm Minoris near elongation with the 18. inch theodolite No. 4; Hl5 measures of horizontal angles were made upon 7 main and 2 secondary objects, and 13 mountain-peaks; and 32 double altitudes were observed with the 3-inch theodolite upon 2~ objects, including the peaks of Catalina Island. The peaks lying between the great plains of J,os Angeles and the Great Desert reach 9,940 feet above the sea. Station Buena Vista, in Los Augeles, was connected with the main triangulation, and for longitude with San Francisco by telegraphic observations. At West Beach station a. signal was erected, the station was occupied and connected with Buena Vista by observations with _the 10-inch theodolite No. 37. J?ifteen objects were observed upon and 15 angles measured, with 129 observations. l'reliminary observations were obtained upon Santa Barbara Island for its relative position. ExclusiYe of a line run with the spirit level from low water to the station, 243 feet above the sea, 8 double altitudes were observed npon 4 objects for the elevation. Southwest Base station was yisited and measures were established for its easy recognition on the plains.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

At Buena Vista the 10-ineh theodolite was used in measuring 12 angles with 97 repetitions. By permission of the city councils of Los Angeles, a brick pier was set up at that station for the transit instrument. Astr011ornical obsen,ations.-At Buena Vista, in Los Angeles, Assistant Davidson obtained permission from the president of the California State Telegraph Company, George H. l\fumford, esq., to connect the observatory by a loop with the telegraph line. After adjusting the meridian instrument the station was left iu charge of 1\Ir. Throckmorton, while l\fr. Davidson repaired to San l<'rancisco, where be received upon the chronograph the transits of Buena Vista, observing the same stars with the transit No. 3, and recording them on the same chronograph. These interchanges were successful upon four nights; 44 transits of 28 stars were registered at San Francisco, and 35 transits of Buena Vista observations upon 25 stars, of which 26 observations were upon 35 stars of the same series. At B.uena Vista Mr. Throckmorton observed, in addition to interchanges, 53 transits of 35 stars ; and at San Francisco l\Ir. Davidson observed 30 transits of 10 stars. Subsequently, the two observers recorded at San Francisco 27 transits for personal equation. At San Bueuaventura Assistant David~on observed two occultations of stars by the moon; and at station Santa Barbara, November 13, 1869, assisted by Messrs. Throckmorton and Harford and by l\Irs. Davidson, be recorded the flight of 556 meteors, and furnished the particulars in a special report. The same observers noted the meteors of November 13, 1870, at San Francisco, recording tl.ie times upon the chronogrnph register. These interesting details were transmitted to Professor Newton, of Yale College. 21fagnetic observatfons.-The usual series of magnetic observations were made at stations Santa Barbara, can Buenaventura, and Dominguez Hill. For absolute magnetic declination, Assistant Davidson and Mr. Throckmorton made 430 observations; for horizontal intensity, 330 observations, using magnetic theodolite No. 5. 'Vith the dip-circle No. 11, 324 observations were made, using three needles, each in three positions of the axles. и Twenty-five volumes, containing duplicates of the records of Assistant Davidson's work on the Santa Barbara Channel, have been received at the office. His observations at other localities within the past ;year are comprised in forty-four volumes, which are yet in hand for duplication. Topography and tertiary triangulatio" of the Sa,nta Barbara Channel.-During the early part of the winter Sul.I-Assistant A. ,V, Chase was engaged in computations and in inkiBg sheets of bis pre>ious work. Duplicates of the reductions ha.-e been received at the office. Later in the season l\fr. Chase commenced the topography and necessary tertiary triangulation near San 'Pedro Bay, working westward from the limits of the plane-table survey of 1854. His surv-ey embraces the coast from Poiut Fermin to Point Vincente, a bold rocky shore backed by a mountain ridge which attains an elevation of 1,478 feet. The crest-line of this ridge is shown on the topographical sheet, which is filled with heavy contouring throughout. The statistics are: Ocean coastиline surveyed ................... _...... __ ......... _..... _. . 8 miles.

The topography was based upon a tertiary triangulation made. by Mr. Chase, and connected with the Santa Barbara scheme of triangulation. Ile determinell 25 stations by H4 measures with a 6-inch repeating theodolite. The duplicates and computations of this work were kept up and plotted as the plane-table survey advanced. The origiual inked sheet has been received at the office. Tracings were previously furnished to the light-house engineer on the Pacidc coast. At station San Pedro l\fr. Chase measured the vertical angles of the mountain-peaks on Cata. liua Island and of other objects with the 3-ioch theodolite; and also horizontal angles to determine the position of Santa Barbara Island. Regular meteorological observations were registered while the party waa in the field. Sub-Assistant Chase was aided by Mr. Max Lipowitz. Aa soon as the season would permit work to the north ward, this party was transferred to Crescent City.

Assistaut W. E. Greenwell completed in the course of the winLer the plaue-ia!Jll: i;l.wets and duplicates of his observations, with descriptions of the signals used in his previous work. These have been received at the office. At the opening of spring he ccmtinnell the topography along the coast of the Santa Barbara Channel, from El Rincon to San Buenaventura, and there joined with the work done in 1854. His survey includes also the mouth of the river, and the vicinity of the town of San Buenaventura. From Point Gorda to San Buenaventura, a distance of 12 miles, the topography is mountainous, rugged, without settlements, aud destitute of wood or water fit for use. Several triangulation stations, established by Assistant Greenwell for this work, served also to furnish the trustees of the town of San Euenaventura with points for a meridian line. From this vicinity the party was transferred to the west of Santa Barbara, and resumed the plane-table survey at the limits reached by Assistant Ifarrison iu 185~. The work was continuecl toward Point Conception, as far as the Goleta. A tertiary triangulation, pre,иiously executed by }fr. Greenwell, served as a basis for this survey. At the date of his report tl1e topography bad been extendecl nearly to station Pelican, and embraced a resurvey of the town of Santa Barbara, to include the improvements since 1852. There, the secondary astronomical station occupied by Assistant Davidson in 1852 was re-established, and connected with tlie regular scheme of triangulation of the Santa Barbara Channel, and with the main astronomical station occupied by 1\fr. Davidson in 1869. The topographical work of the party this sea.Bon fills four sheets on a scale of 10 !o 0 , the projections of which were furnished from the office.

Hydrography of the Santa .Barbara Channel and of San Bu,enai1entura Harbor, California.-Iu order to determine what changes had taken place in the anchorage at San Buenaventura, as indiи cated by the surveys of 1856 and 1869, Assistant Greenwell made soundings there within au area of 7 square miles, measuring 1,193 angles for position, and taking 3,558 casts with the lead. It is thought that in great freshets the river San Buenaventura brings down large quantities of material. The reduction of the hydrogra.phi<l work done by Assistant Cordell in 1869 in the Santa :Barbara Channel bas fully developed a hitherto unknown danger, the rock which lies 12 miles westward of Santa Barbara and one mile off shore, having only 15 feet of water npon it, while the sonnding-lioe gives 7 fathoms inside of the rook. Hytlrograply near Piedras Blancas, OaliforиR.ia.-In November, 1869 7 Assistant Cordell was instructed to search for the Harlooh Castle Rook, which was reported to be th.ree miles off shore, and five milee'north-0f Piedra.a Blancas. It was sa.id to have 14 feet upon it and 25 fathoms inside of it. He was successful in the search, the wrecked vessel's mast being at the time above water. On account of the lateness of the season, this examination was partial, but Mr. Cordell established the position of the rook. It is ha.re at low water, and is 400 yards inside of the kelp line, and .inside of the line joining the adjacent point& north and south of it. The rook i~ out of the track of vessels. The depth i.s 10 fathoms one mile outside of it, and but 3 or 4 fathoms iuside. This was the Ia.st duty performed a.iloat by Assistant Corde1l. He returned to San Francisco and bad ill hand the plotting of soundings which had been made in the course of the season, when his labors were stopped by sudden death, on the 25th of January. . H.

Hydrogmphie re<luctions.-Sub-Assh;taut George Farquhar, who was placetl temporarily iu charge of the hydrographic party after the tleath of Assistant Cortlell, ha& plotted all the work done in 1869 in the San ta Barbara Channel, aud inked and traced 8 sheets of in-shore hydrography upon a scale of nho-, aml one sheet of ofl',shore hydrography on a scale of Too\uoи These charts have all reached the office in 'Vasbington. The original hydrographic records have been partly duplicated. At an interval in the office-work, 1.Ir. Farquhar determined the position and extent of the wharf of the Central Pacific l~ilroa.d Company, from Oakland Point to the shipchannel I;ving on the east side of Yerba Buena Island. Buoys in the entrance and approaches to San Frane~co. Bay.--Assistant Davidson in the course , of the season called my att.ention to the importance of buoys for the Presidio Shoal in the entrance to San Francisco, and also for a mark upon the west side of the Boneta Channel, abreast of the Boneta lig~t. Tllis channel affords a depth of ~ fathoms for entering or leaving San Francisco Bay. Acting upon these suggestions, the Light-honse Board placed the buoys as recommended. The positions of these aids to navigation were subsequently determined by Snb-Assistant Farquhar and l\Ir. Throckmorton, aid in the party of Assi::;tant Davidson. Yerba Buena Channel, Smi Francisco Bay, California.-Upon becoming familiar with the bay of San Francisco and its approaches by land and sea, oBe might easily be impressed with the thought иthat the future welfare of California and of the region adjacent must ever be critically involved in any and all projects that contemplate changes in the physical order and regimen of this magnificent basin and its outlet. It is estimated that two-thirds of the drainage of the State of California finds its way into San Fmncisco Bay, and in equal measure, at least, we should estima.te and expect to provide for the conveyance of trade; for, although railways have modified the old rules of commercial development in many particulars, they are all pat.hways to the ocean, and must hasten the concentration of wealth and population at the best havens upon the sea-board. At.the time of my visit, in July last, the pile-wharf of the Central Railway projected about 3,711 yards into San Francisco Bay, and the company were petitioning for permission to cross the Yerba Channel to the shore of Yerba Buena Island, a further distance of 1,089 yards. An encroachment so extensive naturally excited alarm. among public-spirited individuals, and seemed to require a careful inquiry into tbe probable effects of the proposed structure. I tberefQre directed Assistant Henry Mitchell, who has charge of the division of physical hydrography, to make a series of observations upon the volumes of water passing through the channels in this vicinity, and the comparative work execnted by them. In his report, Appendix No. 18, he sums up the results in the following words : "It appears from these data that the complete closure of the Yerba Ohannel would augment the velocity in the main channel only 12 per cent. If we confine our attention to the portion of the present railroad-pier which serves as a bridge only-that is to say, if we take the present wharf, exclusive of the portion containing slips and ferry- berths, we find from our observations that the reduction of velocity caused by the piles is 15 per cent., from which we may safely conclude that if the bridge were to be extended, with similar construction, to the island, the Joss of passing volume would be less than four million cubic yards, and the augmentation of the velocity in the main channel only 2~ per cent." The southern part of San Francisco Bay receives but little land-water. Its small feeders, even when swelled to torrents in the rainy season, do not ca.use any considerable :6.ood as low down as the neighborhood under consideration, so that the proposed open bridge would not operate as a dam to any serious disadvantage. I would not be understood to say tha.t the bay is subject fo no rise in the rainy season, but that the rise which occasionally occurs does not come from the intlows above (southward of) the site of the proposed structure. If the open bridge should be built, I see no reason to apprehend that the augmentation of fiow through the main channel wilf at any time be so great as t.o increase sensibly the present inconveniences of the anchorage, either directly by causing vessels t.o part their chains, or indirectly by scouring away the present patches of excellent holding-ground. That the structure wm close to future use a navigable avenue, is an objection that must be weighed by the commercial public in the balance with the immediate advantages of the railway extension, and, as far as I can 1ee, this

is the only question that need be entertained, since no serious disturbance of the ph,rsical order, affecting other portions of the bay, can be preclicted. Middle time.-One of the useful results of Mr. Mitchell's visit to the Pacific coast, is an improvement in the form of the current-tables for those ports where the diurnal inequalities of the tides are large. He suggests that the "middle time of jfood" and the " middle time of ebb" should be made the principal elements, because least subject to variation, and because most valnable to the navigator, who desires most of all, in approaching a port, to know at what time he is likely to find an ebb-current too strong to be stemmed or a ,flood-current strong enough to carry him over the bar or past other dangers. The diurnal inequalities in the intervals of high water liave the opposite sign from those of low waoor, except at those dates when the diurnal tide-wave is small and about to shift its relative position to the semi-diurnal tide; an intermediate phenomenon, therefore, like maximum flood orebbcurrent, would usually remain unaffected except at the inlets of great lagoons where the tides and currents are not synchronous. The outflows of rivers,~and e\иen the moyements due to wi111ls, may be regarded as uniform during a single tide, and without effect upon the time of maximum velocity. The "middle time," computed from all the observations of an entire flood or ebb, is preferable to the selection of the highest velocity recorded, because any single observation may he affected hy the yawing of the vessel or by some other accident. The great labor required in arranging tables from the voluminous ob8ervatious in the archives of the Coast Survey has delayed Mr. Mitchell's report on the su~ject. Astronomical observatwns at Point Arena and San Fmncisco, OaUjornia.-To connect the triangulation near Point Arena, which now includes, as one of the stations, the new light-house there, with San Francisco, for longitude, Assistant иDavidson transported 19 chronomeoors from the vVashington Square observatory to Arena Cove. At the San Francisco station, transit No. 3 was used with the Kessel's clock and a Hipp chronograph; at Arena the Davidson meridian-instrument was used with a Frodsham's break-circuit chronometer and the Hipp chronograph. The time observations at both places embraced 156 transits of 73 stars. At Arena, latitude observations were made with the meridian-instrument on 11 pairs of stars during one night. A meridianmark was set there for the subsequent uses of Sub-Assistant Sengteller. Magnetic observations.-For the determination of the magnetic declination at Arena Village, with the theodolite magnetometer No. 5, 63 observations were recorded on two days, and others were made for azimuth. The station was connected with the triangulation. Five volumes, containing the records of Mr. Davidson at this station, have been received at the office. Before returning to San Francisco, Assistant Davidson made a general examination of the coast from Russian River to the northward of Point Arena. In this service he was accompanied by his a.id, Mt. Throckmorton. и Topography and triangulation at Point Armio, California.-Sub-Assistant Louis A. Sengteller organized a party for the topography and necessary triangulation at Point Arena, early in the winter of 1869-'70, commencing at a point about 7 miles south of the light. From thence the work was extended to the northward. The means available for this service were limited, the season was late, and it proved to be rainy. The topographical work done by this party is included in two sheets. These represent the small shipping cove to the southward of Arena, and the coast to a point 9 miles northward of the light-house. Some heavy country is embraced, partly covered with timber, and a varying coastline of bold blntfs and sand-dunes. The highest point shown by the topography is 820 feet. In prosecuting the plane-table survey, attention was incidentally given to the lines of plateaux, exhibiting the features of old sea-levels.

For the triangulation, Mr. Sengteller chained a base on the Point Arena plateau, and from it extended a series of triangles north and south to embraee also the crest-line of the sea-coast mountains. This scheme was arranged so as t-0 connect hereafter with the secondary astronomical stations of 1853, occupiecl by Assistant Davidson, at Haven's Anchorage and Mendocino Bay. At the latter station Mr. Sengteller found almost intact the original markings of the station.

After connecting the work with the meridian-marks established by Assistant Davidson at Arena, Mt. Sengteller made a recomutissance towards Mendocino Bay. He also erected the astronomical pier at Arena; and in May accompanied Mr. Davidson along tlrn coast for selecting stations to extend the triangulation. The records of work done near Point Arena have been duplicated and co~puted, and the t-0pographical sheets haye been iuked. During part of the season Sub-.Assistant Sengreller was aided by Mr. II. Yiucent, and for the remainder by Mr. Charles Schenk. ",.hen about to transfer liis party to the southern coast for work this winter, the house in which Mr. Sengtellcr had placecl his topographical sheets and instruments was burned, and subsequently the vessel in whicl1 tl1e.r were shipped was wrecl;:ed, lmt he ne:vertl1eless brought all in safety to San Francisco. Topograplty mul triangulation of Ilumboldt Bay pnrl 1:icinily.-Assist,ant Augustus F. Rodgers, after inking aml tracing the slieets of the preyious year, and duplicating and computing the work of triangulation, resumed field dnt,y on Humboldt Bay, at the northern limit of the previous season's work. Ile there measured a !Jase of over 2,000 meters with the auxiliary base apparatus of the survey, and from the resulting length he recomputed the llrevious triangulation and made his projectiom; for tbe topogra1lhical sheets. Observations for azimuth were made on иPolaris at elongation at the astronomical station which was occupied l>y Assistant Davidson in 1869, and this Mr. Rodgers cAmnected with his triangulatiou. The topography of the season is comprised on six sheets, by which the s1uvey was extended from Table Bluff to Gihon's Bluff. A suppleи mentary sheet shows the changes observed at the mouth of Eel Uiver. The nature of the country surveyed is dirnrsified. Humboldt Bay is fringed lly a large area of marshy fiats cut up by extensive sloughs. North of it the ocean beach is in part sand-dune, uut from Little River to Gihon's Bluff, north of Rocky Point,_ it is boltl, and, being mostly covered with heavy forests to the edge of the bluffs, it is ina-0cessible with the }llane-table.

During part of the sea.son, Assistant Rodgers prosecuted the field-work with a detached party, one plane-table being assigned to Mr. E. F. Dickins, who ooted as aid during the season. Before leaving the vicinity, Mr. Rodgers incidentally made a hydrographic examination of the entrance and bar of Humboldt Bay. The results will be used for oomparison with 801lndings made by the hydrographic party of Sub-Assistant Farquhar. Hydrography of Hum1Jolilt Bay and approaches.-In October, 1869, Sub-Assistant George Farquhar was instructed to organize a party and make a hydrogra.phic survey of Humboldt Eay and the approaches. Notwithstanding the bad weather which marked the season, he made a successful examination. The shore-line and the positions of the signals were furnished by Assistant Rodgers, and the sounding-lines run were plotted as the work advanced. Four sheets have been :filled, embracing the approaches as far south as Table Bluff. The examination shows that change8 are continually taking place at the entrance and on the bar.

Farquhar is now engaged in a detailed examination of Blossom Rock, in San Francisoo Day. In the course of the season he made projections for the hydrograpbic survey of the approaches to Crescent City and Cape Orford. Topography and tertiary tria1igulation twrtlt of Oiиegcent City, Califoriiia.-Sub-Assistant A. \V. Chase transferred his party from San Pedro to Crescent City in April, and continued the topography and triangulation from the limits of his last ;year's work. North of Lake Earl he measured a base of 900 meters, with the subsidiary base apparatus, and carried the triangulation along the coast of California and Oregon to the westward of Chetko River, resting on the Northwest Seal Rock of the Crescent City Reef. At the request of the United States surveyor-general for Califorи nia, Sherman Day, esq., Mr. Chase connected the north boundary of the State as marked by the United States land-office smvey, with the triangulation, and furnished a tracing of the shore-line from Crescent City northward, to include the forty-seoond parallel. For the computation of the L. M. Z's he observed a preliminary azimuth by means of Polaris at elongation. In the topography the shores of Lake Earl are included. Fours sheets were filled, and the work embraces elevations of 1,300 feet. The computation of the triangulation was kept up in duplicate as the field-work advanced.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The shore-line traced north of Crescent City gives a good basis for the de,"elopment of the hydrography off-shore, and through the dangerous reef .off Point Saint George. Tidal observatiom.-The self-registering tide-gauge at San Diego has been kept running by ~Ir. William Knapp and that at Fort Point by Mr. F. P. Thompson. Each of these observers has, also, furnished a good series of meteorological observations, and tabulated the readings of high and low waters from the tide-rolls. Scales graduated on glass were supplied from the office for that purpose. My acknowledgments are due for the efficient supervision of Major G. H. Elliot, United States Engineers, of the operations for several years at these stations, reference to which has been made in previous annual reports. Late in March last, the care of the stations was transferred by that officer to Major G. H. Mendell, of the United States Engineers, and thus tbe continuity of we' series of observations for ultimate purposes is properly assurerl. SECTION XI.

Topography of the shores of tlte Colwnuia Rivcr.-Assistant Cleveland Hockwell continued the plane-table survey on the north bauk of the Oolnmllia until the end of November, 1869, and comи pleted the details between Chinook Point and Gray's Bay. The conntr;y being almost inaccessible on the north side of the river, tLe work of contoming was very difficult. During the winter of 1869, l\fr. Rockwell inked and traced the topographical sheets of the previous season. These sheets have been received at the office. Ile projected three sheets for the work of the year just closed, and in May re-organized hi!'! party and resumed the topography of the shores and islands of the Cohunbia, basing it on tl1e triangulation which was made by Assistant Cutts in 1852. Iu the interval some of the marks of the tertiar_y stations bad been bidden by a growth of timbe1и, but nearly all of them were found. The work of the season, which closed in ~oveml.Je1и last, includes both banks of the river and the numerous low, marshy islands in it as far up as Cathlamet Point and Three Tree Point, where the river contracts to a width of two miles. The widest part, from the head of Gray's Day to the south shore, is nearly nine miles across. The mud flats of Gray's Bay, and the flats, marshy islands, and sloughs on the southern si<le of the river, were mapped carefully, a.rill pains were taken to delineate the lowиwater lines.

Early in August Mr. George H. Wilson joined him as aid, and is yet attached to the party. The shores of the Columbia. River are rocky and high, densely covered with large timber and thick undergrowth, and impenetrable for any distance with the plane-table. Some points on the crest of the ridges nMrest to the river shores have been approximately determined in position, and the general characteristics of the topography have been sketched in. Magnetic observations.-While on a tour of inspection along the northern coast, Assistant George Davidson determined the magnetic declination at Astoria and at Portland, with the theodolite magnetometer No. 5. The number of observations recorded for time, azimuth, and declination, is 244. Duplicates of the records have been received at the o:t'lice. He was aided in this se-rvioo by .Mr. S. R. Throckmorton, jr. Topography of Port Discovery, lVashington Tcrrit-ory.-Under mauy disadvantages a.rising fro1n had weather, the pla.ne-table survey of the shores of Port Discovery was continued by Assistant .T. S. Lawson until the middle of October, in 1869. At that date the entire shore-line had been traced, though the dense fog that prevailed in the Strait of Fuca had steadily encroached, and finally enveloped the site of work. Further operations being thus prevented, tbe brig Fauntleroy was sent to Olym1)ia, to be laid up for the winter, lmt owing to a long-continued calm she did not.

After securing the yessel and discharging the crew, Assistant Lawson ancl the aid, Mr. J. J. Gilbert, took up and completed the office-work of the season. Reference will he macle further on to the resumption of work in this vicinity. Triangul,ation and upograpliy of P.uget Sound and of tltc !:;trait of Puw, lVasltington Territory.In February, l\fr. Lawson made a reconnaissance for connecting the solar eclipse station of July 18, 1860, with the triangulation of Puget Sound. Ile found the station, and selected others to be occupied later in the season. In this examination he fortunately identified the astronomical station which was occupied in 1841 by the United States Exploring Expedition, under Lieutenant (now Rear-Admiral) Oharles Wilkes, and connected it with the coast triangulation. In connecting the solar eclipse station, four milNl of av-enues through hcayy timber were opened by the part;y. The triangulation of the Strait of Fuca in the vicinity of Dungeness was carried forward, to include "\Vashiugton Harbor, and was connected with the work of 1855. After the completion of the plane-table work there, the triangulation was extended to the southwar(l of Deception Pass, along the western shores of иwhidbey Island. All the records of this work have been turned in, with the abstracts and the computations. Tllc statistics of the triangulation are as follows : Signals erected .................... __ .. _..... _.................... _.. _. . 7'5 Stations occupied ............................... - .................... _. . 61 Objects observed on ..................... _............... _......... _. . . . . 686 Angles measured . . . .. и . . . . . . . . . . ...................................... _ 330 Number of observations .и...........................................и... 13, 621 The area covered by the triangulation is 160 square miles. Sixty vertical angles upon four objects were observed from one station of the triangulation; an<l observations for the position and elevation of Mount Rainier were also made by Assistant Lawson. The country between Wa8hington Harbor and New Dungeness was examined for a base-line of three or four miles in length, but no site was found suitable for measurement. The ground is heavily timbered and covered densel,y with undergrowth, and the surface is much broken by marshy stretches, broken bluffs, and creeks. A site for a base of verification for the triangulation which extends through Admiralty Inlet and Puget Sound from the Port Townshend base of 1855, was selected by Assistant Lawson. This line can be readily connected with the triangulation from the solar eclipse station. In May, Mr. Lawson organized detached party for topography. The plane-table work, done under his direction by Mr. Gilbert, includes the final sheet of Port Discovery, and on others the shore from thence to New Dungeness, with Washington Harbor, and the mouth of theDungeness River, where great changes were causell by the severe storm of 1866. The shores of Whidbey Island were mapped from Admiralty Head southward to Lagoon Point, and the shores of Smith's Island and Minor Island, where important changes have taken place. The country surveyed is difficult for the topographer, the shores being bordered by thickly-set timber and brush, growing on moderately level ground. The work was delayed in July and August by smoke from the adjaи cent burning forests.

Hydrography of tke Strait of F,uca, WashingtQn Tcrritory.-Assistant Lawson discovered a dangerous ledge of rocks in the southern entrance to Rosario Strait, having but 3! fathoms upon it, with 56 fathoms near it on all sides. On account of the lateness of the season and bad weather, the survey of the vicinity was not completed, but the position and ex.tent of the ledge have been determined. This danger to navigation is in the direct li~e of vessels through Rosario Strait. Mr. La.wsen also sounded to the eastward of Belle Rock and Rosario Strait, but the stormy character of the season interrupted the work. By the courtesy of the collector of customs, Mr. S. Drew, esq ., at Olympia, th~ revenue cutter Lincoln was employed in these examinations, and great interest waa manifestoo by Captain Scammon aml by the officers of the cutter in prosecuting the work.

Its principal operations are recited under the following heads: Computing Division.-The work of this division has been, as heretofore, under the immediate charge of Assistant Cha.rlee A. Schott, under whose able direction the progress of the work has been kept up to a Yery satisfactory standard. In addition to performing the duties of this charge, l\fr. Scliott made in June magnetic observations at the station in Washington, keeping up the continuity of the series, and in autumn accompanied the party of the Superintendent for observи ing the solar eelipse of December 22, 1870. His services as an observer at Catania, in Sicily, are noticed in Appendix No. 16. The adjustment, by the method of least squares, of the primary triangulation on the eastern coast has been completed, and that of the secondary triangulation has boon pushed forward as fast as the limited force of computers permitted. The introduction of improved places of stars, from the most recent determinations, for our astronomical latitudes is rapidly advancing. Assistant Schott established the oo~ditionaJ equations of the primary triangulation south of Kent Island, made a revision of the reduction of the transatlantic telegraphic difference of longitude between Greenwich and Cambridge, Massachusetts, commenced the micrometric measures of the photoи graphic images of the solar eclipse observed by him at Springfield, Illinois, 1869, and among other reports submitted the following: и On a preliminary investigation respecting the choice of the localities favorable for obl!erving the ni;}xt transit of Venus across the S!lll's disk; on the deflection of the plumb-line in the vicinity of the District of Columbia; a preliminary determination of a spheroid which best represents the astronomical and geodetic measures on the surface covered by the primary triangulati-0n between Calais and W ashiugton. He also submitte<l supplementary papers on a former report on det.ermination of time a.ntl of azimuths. The foree employed in the division, and the distribution of duties, have been the same as for several years past, Assistant T. W. Werner computing the current triangulations; Dr. G и .Rumpf and Mr. E. H. Court.enay making the verifications of the same by comparison with the field-computations, keeping the registers of geographical positions, and making the computations of :final adjustment of the triangulation, while Mr. J. Main ma.de the computations of astronomical work. Mr. E. A. Bowser also assisted in the computations during several months. и Tidal .Division.-The inspection of the tidal and meteorological observations, when received at the office, the correspo"nde~ce with the observers, the supervision of the computations, and other work relating to tides and tide-gauges, have been kept up by Mr. R. 8 и .Avery, assisted by Mr. A. Gottbefl, Mr. J. Downes, and Miss M. Thomas. All data. and other information respecting tides, required for office use, for observers, and for the use of field-parties, have also been furnished. The ordinary rednctions of the observations, and deduction therefrom of the general results used for charts and other purposes, have been made as soon after the observations were received as practicable. The tide-tables, or predictions, for 1871, the fifth year of the series, have been computed in this division, and are published. They contain the approximate predicted times and heights of the tides for about twenty of the most important places on onr cpasts, with tables of constants for - finding from them the tides for rt great number of other places.

Hydrogm1iliic Dfrisioti.-The drawing and \erification of bydrograpbic charts from the original notes of soundings and angles, the Ycrification of charts retlnced to the scales of publication, the preparation of sailing-directions and all notes pertaining to navigation, have been, as heretofore, performed in this division of the ofiice, under the immediate tlirection of Ca])tain C. P. Patterson, inspector of hydrography, by l\Ir. E. "\VillenbUcber, assisted by Mr . .J. Sprandel. Dmwing .DfriRion.-In the conduct of this branch of the office tlie assistant in charge ha>1 been ably seconded by 1\Ir. "'IV. T. Bright, wl10 bas had charge of the details of the tlivision, and has materially assisted in planning the work. The drawi11gs for engra>ed charts Jiaye been rnmle h~и Mr. A. Lindenkohl, chief dt'aughtsman, and hy :Messrs. II. I.indenkohl, L. Karcher, and F. Fairfax. 'l'raced copies of maps have been made hy W. Vairfax and n. Hooe. Views of headlands arnl approaches to harbors have been taken clnring the year by .!\Ir. W . .l\fo"'.\lurtrie, and were arterward drawn by him for engravi11g on thl' cliarts. Copies of manuscript maps and charts, or portions of such, are frequently furuished, upon request, to other hranches of the public seryice, as well as to private persons; the latter, of course, paying tlte cost tlwreof. This is an important form in whicll the information collected hy the Coast Snrnи.r becomes aYai1ahfo to tlrn public, and a list of the ma1)s so furnished during the year is gi;иen in Appendix No. 2. A list of the maps and charts, either wholly drawn tlnring the year, or tlie work on wl1icl1 has heen continued as far as the material 011 hand permittNl, together with the irnmes of t11e persons engaged upon them, is given in .Appendix No. 3. In addition to the work shown in that table, cornprisiug tift~--tliree maps and charts worked upon, and eleyeu completed, the f'ollowiug stat1и1111и11l will sen-tи m<Jre fully to t>xhiliit the operations of the diYision : Prqjects for uew charts prepared . ___ ... _.. _............. __ . _. ___ . . . . . . . . . . . !I Tracings made on special calls . _...... _. _. _.. _. _.. ___ ... _____ . _ . _... _. __ .. _ 106 Projections made for field-maps ..... _. _..... _... _... _...... _...... _.. __ . 3i Pr~jections made on copper for cngrayed charts ... _____ .. _... и... _. _... _ .. _. _ 4 88 _i\liscellaneous traciugs and diagrams for field and ofiice use .. _. _.. ___ ... _..

Engraving IHi1i11ion.--In tl1is division, nmler t11e efiicieut diredion of Assistaut E. Jlergeslieimer, the progress of the work has heen weU sustained. Uuring the ;rear thirteen cliarts Lani heeu completed, eigl1t new ones ha;rn been commencetl, and the work on ninetC("ll has been continued, besides the usual amount of miscellaneous additions to the progress-sketclies aud other plates not specified in the tabulated report, ApLJendix No. и1. The reduction of outlines upon the plates witll the pantograph has continued to gi\"e satisfactory result.-, and to facilitate and economize the work of' the didsion; while the rouletting of the tints of the nsual sections of the hott-0m lms enabled us to publish rapidl,y a class of charts ver,r desirable and useful, in advance of the more detailed and finished harbor-charts. During the year l\fr. H. 111. Knight has been added to the force of the division as a miscellaneous engraver, and Mr. "'IV. H. Da\is returned from his temporary employment in the office of the assistant in charge. Messrs. J. Enthoffer, H. C. Evans, A. Sengteller, and A. M. J\Iaedel have continued the engraYing of the topography of the ilOиho scale coast series. Messrs.иJohn Knight, R A. l\faedel, awl A. retersen have continued as letter-engra-.ers. The miscellaneous engra\ing has been executed by Messrs. H. S. Barnard, J. C. Kondrnp, R. F. Bartle, W. A. Thompson, II.1\1. Knight, J. G. Thompson, F. W. Benner, E. H. Sipe, and W. II. Da\is. Mr. E. Molkow has continued the pantographing of outliues. The views have been engraved by Mr. G. McCoy. The clerical duties of the division have been performed hy_J\Ir. George A. l\Iorrison. The electrotyping and photographing operations have been eontinned by l\fr. George Mathiot, assisted by F. Ober. Thirty electrotype copper-plates, mostly of the largest class, ha\ing between 900 and 1,500 square inches surface, have been made during the year, part of which are altos, or relief-plates, from engraved plates; part bassos, or printing-plates.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT U. S. COAST SURVEY.

The photographic reductions requiretl for the use of the drawing and engraving divisions have been matle as heretofore. ])i1iis,ion of Charts an1l Instruments.-Tbe work in this division, which inclucles, besides the safekeeping of archives, tl1e map-printing, clistribution of charts and reports, alHl the mechanician's and carponter shops, lms bcon directed during the year by J\Ir. J. T. Hoover. 'l'he duty of registering and filing, for convenient reference, the original map8 and charts of the survey, and the records of observations made in the field, and of keeping an acco1rnt of the same, as they are used in the office, has been performed hy l\ir. A. Zumbrock. Dttring the year :_ml original and 14li duplicate volumes of records of geouetical, hydrographical, and tidal obsen,atious l1ave bee11 received at the office; original topographical maps, 56; original и l1yclrographical chitrtR, r. t; professional hook:s antl periodicals, 421 yo]umes. Tue copper-1Jlate printing has been, as heretofbre, acceptably <lone by J\Ir. T. Y. Dnrbam, wlio bas tumctl out 8,35:! impressions of charts, besides all the proofs required for office use. Lithographic impre;:sions were also procurt>ll to the number of 2,764 sJieets. The work of backing with muslin the sheets requiredи by field and hydrogrnphic parties, and the miscellaneous duties pertaining to the folding-room, wern performed <luring the ymtr by Mr. H. Xissen. The map-room was in the care of J\fr. Thomas J\fcD01111ell. An aggregate of 11,430 copies of cliarts have been issued within the year, and 1G copies of the Atlas of Ilarbors in Alaska, and 1,306 copies of Annual Ueports of Yarious years have been tlit-:trilmtcd. The work in the instrument-shop was done, under the supen-ision of l\Ir. John Clark, by J. Foller, William Jacobi, Charles \Yunlemann, and apprentice E. Rshleman. 'l'he wood-work of instruments, tlleir padd1ig for trans1wrtatio11, the construction of cases for maps and copper-plates, antl all work of carpentry required in the oflice, llas been performed by J\Ir. A. Yeatman, assisted hy :\fr. F. E. r_,ackey. :Mr. V. E. King l1as continued in the performance of t!Je duties of chief clerk of the ofiice, having charge of the general correspondence autl oftiee accounts, assisted by Mr. Dallas E. \Vainwright as writer. .!\fr. Clayton A. Hoover acted as writer in the l1;rtlrograpbic office. In the otlice of the genPral dislmrsing agent of the Coast Survey, Sa,muel Ilein, esq., the unties of principal accountant allll book-keeper have been (liseharge<l with promptness and dispatch by Mr. R.. J_,. Hawkins duri11g the past as in many prc\'ioas years, l\Ir. \V. A. Herbert and Harry S. Heiu acting as writers. The abilit;r with which the assi,~tant in charge, ,J.E. Ililgard, esq., conducts the affairs of the office has reliern<l me from all anxiety in reference to that important division of the work. It is, too, a matter of just pride to mention here that his recognized knowledge and skill have been frequently invited and have been chee1иfully enlisted in behalf of other departments of the public serYice, for deciding on practical questions of иsci en ti Ile import. I would refer with pleasure to the new office quarters, in which, under an emergency constraining us to vacate the buildings heretofore occupied, the forethought and arrangements of the assistant, in charge ha,иe secured accommodations long needed for the several branches of officework, as well as for the Coast Survey archives and instruments. иwith renewed satisfaction record is again made of ~he integrity and scrupulous care of the disbursing agent, Samuel Hein, esq., in regard to the accounts. By his conscientious aclherence to regulations which limit the expenditure for outfit, and which in other respects apply to the prospective work, economy in the service has been steadily preserved. I would recognize also, as heretofore, the clerical assistance rendered in the Superintendent's office by the skill of W.W. Cooper, esq., and his untiring fidelity in the discharge of adjunct duties under my per!wnal direction. Respectfully submitted. BENJ AM.IN PEIRCE, Hou. GEORGE

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 5.
A TABULAR STATEMENT OF RESULTS COMPUTED FOR TIDE-TABLES FOR CHARTS OF THE WESTERN COAST OF THE UNITED STATES. BY R. S. AVERY.

The results given in the following tables were obtained by the process fully described in the Coast Survey report for 18G8, pp. 103-108, and tbere exemplified by application to the tidesи, observed at Sitka. The followfng general statement applies to all places named in the tables. The two tides of the same day are generally unequal in proportion to the moon's declination. The time and height can be obtained approximately from the following tables. The interval is to be added to the time of the moon's meridian passage to gi\'e the time of high or low water. The time of the moon's upper meridian passage is given in the almanac, and the time of its lower meridian passage is the middle between two successive upper passages. The heights are given in feet and tenths, and show the rise above the level of the average of the lowest low water; to which level the soundings on the charts are given. ~'lpring-tii1es.-At the full and change of the moon the high waters will lie a feet higher than the above, and the low waters b feet lower. Neap-tides.-At the moon's first and last quarters tlie high waters will be c feet lower, and the low wateni will not fall as low by d feet. The values of a, b, c, d, for each place will be given iu the last column of the following tables:

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 6.
MODE OF FORMING BRIEF PREDICTION TIDE-TABLES. BY R. S. AVERY.

The object in forming such tables as the following has been to provide means for predictingи, approximately the times and heights of the high and low waters from data embracing only short series of observations. It has been found иconvenient to use such tables where the observations have not been sufficientl;y extended to allow of more elaborate treatment, and it is well to have methods suited to different cases. Only one or two years' observations were used in forming each of the following tables, which have been used in making the predictions publii;;hed by the Coast Snrvey Office, and found to answer well. The process followed iu forming these tables is substantially the same as was given in the Coast Survey Report for 1868, but more extended. The preliminary reductions and plottings were made and the plane of refe.rence found as there described. Then instead of classifying for only four phases of the moon we arrange for all the octants, and insteatl of writing the ordinates for only four positions of the moon in declination we use eight. The form of the tables that follow shows what changes from the process pursued in the article above referred to must be made in making the c-0mbinations. .Further study of the subject showed that great adrnntages would result from increasiug the nnmber of ordinates, as is here done, especially for the moon's phases. In making predictions by these tables, it is necessary to use rolls of pa.per printed in checks so arranged tllat the time can he most conveniently written thereon horizontally, and the intervals and heights Yertically, as ordinates to curves. Then having marked the places, in mean local civil time, of the moon1s declination, positions and phases, reduced from the times gi,иen in the Nautical Almanac, and advanced to the right by the amount of the mean limitidal interval, plot the ordinates given in the table for the moon-declination curves, and draw them lightly with a pencil. Then lay down tlie moon's phases in the same way, but the values given in the tables for the phases must be treated as corrections, and laid off from the curves already described above or below, acи cording to the signs prefixed to them in the table. Then new curves are to be drawn through these points with inks or more strongly with }Jencils. 'Ve next write down ou computation paper, conYeniently ruled, the times of the moon's upper and lower transits suited to the meridian of the place, and write under them the ordinates read from our final currns obtained as above, reading these ordinates cor.responding to the times of the transits. Then adding the time or interval ordinates to the times of the transits we have the predicted times, and the corresponding height ordinates are the predicted heights.

APPENDIX No. 7.
REPORT ON THE LEVELING OPERATIONS BETWEEN KEYPORT, ON RARITAN BAY, AND GLOUCF.STER, ON THE DELAWARE RIVБR, TO DETERMINE THE HEIGHT ABOVE MEAN TIDE OF THE PRBIAR\' STATIONS BEACON IIILL, DISBOROUGfI, STONY HILL, MOCXT HOLLY, AND PINE IlILL. BY RICI [ARD D. CUTTS, ASSISTANT COAST SURVEY, IN CIIAlWE OF SECOXDARY TRIANGULATION.

HEIGHTS ABOVE MEAN TIDE

DETER~HNED

BY TIIE SPIRIT-LEVEL.

The leveling was executed in 18i0, by Charles Ferguson, esq., Sub-assistant United States Coast Survey. The line started from mean tide at Keyport, on Raritan Bay, and, following the route most convenient for determining the height of the primary stations, ended at mean tide of the Delaware River at Gloucester City. The route pursued was not, tlwrefore, the most direct, tbe one preferred heing that on which the longest extent of turnpike and railroad track could be made available. The length of the main line was seYenty-se-rnn miles, and of the offsets, thirteen miles; the total distance leveled and releveled, one section after the other, being one lmudred and eighty miles. The observations are contained in ten volumes. These latter will show the different sections into which the main line was divided; the offsets to the triangulation stations Beacon Hm, Disи borough, Stony Hill, and Mount Holly; also, the offsets to the barometer stations; and, finally, the height above mean tide of the bench-marks established at the villages through which the line passed. An additional line of leYels was run in 1871 by Mr. B. A. Colonna, ai(l United States Coast Survey, to connect the triangulation and barometer station Pine Hill with the bench-mark at Gloucester City.
TIDAL STATIONS.

A tideиstaff was set up at Kesport and another at Gloucester City, and the tides were observed at each station during a half-lunation, for the purpose of determining the l<wel of mean tide. This level, or the computed half-tide "mark on the staff, was then transferred to a permanent bench-mark established in the '\"iciuity of each tide-gauge-these two benchиmarks being the termini of the line of le'\"els.
INSTRU::.\fEJS'TS.

The instrument used was a pi,иot-lcvel made by Wurdemann. The telescope possessed a mag. nifying power of 30, was provided witl1 a reticule of three fixed horizontal wires about 4' apart, and of two vertical wires, and with a riding-leveJ, a division of which represented 3" in arc at tlie average temperature at which the instrument would be used in the field. The leveling-rod was made of seasoned Honduras mahogany and painted white; was 3m.2 in length by om.06 in width and om.04 in thickness, and was pro\ided with a wooden handle attached to the back part, about 5.6 feet aboYe the bottom, and by means of which the rod could be carried and held in position, and with two small levels, fixed at right angles, to secure its verticality. To prevent displacement, or change of level when the rod was turned round for the back sight, the foot of the rod, incased in brass, terminated in a cylindrical button, fitted to and moving freely iu the socket of the iron foot-plate on which it rested. This plate, six inches in diameter, was armed underneath with sharp-pointed legs, so that when it was dropped by the rod-man on reaching bis station, it could be firmly planted in the ground by a stamp or two of the foot. A light chain, with a ring as a handle, was attached to the plate, by which the latter could be readily taken up al!d carried forward bs the rod-man. Three of such rods and foot-plates accompanied the levelinginstrument, two sets for constant use and the other held as a reserve.

76

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The rods were divided to centimeters, the divisions and comparisons having been made at the Coast Suney Office in 'Vashington.
FIELD ODSERVATIONS .A.ND RECORDS.

The :first operation consisted in determining the values of the instrnmental constants, >iz : 1. Of a division of the level; 2. Of the angular distance between the horizontal wires ; and 3. Of the reduction of the mean of the three wires to the middle wire. By means of these constants, tables were macle out which gave, by inspection: A.-The distance of the instrument to the rod; B.-The correction to reduce the mean of the three wires to the mi!ldle wire; 0.-The correction on account of the want of level at the moment of obser>ation, and of tlie daily recorded instrumental errors; and D.-The correction for difference of distance between the back and fore sights. The order in which the obser>ations were made and recorded, and the directions followed in conducting the operation, may be stated as follows: I.-An adjustment of the instrument, either complete or closely approximate, with all the details duly entered in the record. This adjustment was made at the commencement and end of each day's work, anu consisted: a-iu making the axis of the level parallel with the optical axis of the telescope; b-in making the axis of the level perpendicular to the vertical axis of the instrument; and c-in bringing the middle horizontal wire and the middle of the two vertical wfres in the optical axis of the telescope. иwhen this adjustment was approximate only, Tables B and C enabled the computer to apply the necessary corrections to the results of the uay's leveling. II.-The placing of the instrument midway, and, if possible, in line between the two rods. In cases where the distance between the back and fore sights was necessarily or by accident unequal, as shown by the recorded differences between the extreme wires, Tables D supplied the correction to be applied on account of the resulting inequality of currnture and refraction. 111.-The protection of the instrument from the direct rays of the sun by a cap when carried and an umbrella when in use. IV.-The adjustment for verticality of axis; of the focus for distinct ,-ision; of the bubble to the middle of the tube and the reconling of tlie divisious as shown by the eye and object ends; the reatliug of the heights on the rod crossed by the three wires, and .the second reading and recordiug of the lm-el bubble. Table C supplied the correction for the difference between the readings of the two ends of the bubble. Y.-Bench-marks were established at the end of each da_y's work, at the different villages through which the line was carried, and wheuenir from auy cause the le>eling was suspended. The details of the work were carried out in conformity with the order and principles contained in instructions specially prepared for the instrument used and the ohject in view, under the four following headings: 1. Tide-gauge, records, an<l tidal-station or bench-mark. 2. Adjustment of the instrument. 3. Formulre, constants, and correctio11s. 4. General directions for running a line of leV"els. The re-leveling was required not merely for the sake of verification, but for precision, as it is a ~ell-established fact that there will be always a difference, irrespective of instrumental and per. sonal errors, between the results obtained by the lernling of a line in one direction, and then back again to the starting point. The heights will be given, in all cases, above the mean tide of Raritan Bay; _the description of the principal bench-marks is given in the records. The revised results will be published in the next annual report.

DIF:B'ERElliCES OF ALTITVDE DETER)UJ.'IED DY THE CISTERi'\ BAR0:.1'1BTER.

The observers W<'re F. II. Agnew, sub-assistant; Edwin Smith, D. A. Colonna, and Charles L. Gardner, aids, United States Coast Surиey, aud Mr. Charles F. Wurdemann, and it is to their care and interest in eYery detail that the success of the operation is principally due. The barometers and psychrometers were made specially for the purpose by .Tames Green, esq., of New York, and were of the most appro\иed and delicate construction. Tlie diameters of the barometer tubes were, respectively, 0.27, 0.28, 0.29, and 0.30 of an inch. The correction for capillarity was made on the scale. In this connection it may be mentioned that t11e imitruIUeuts were carefnll,y compared with the standard, although inte11d!'cl for the determination of differences aml not of absolute heights. The party was organized at )fount llolly, New Jersey, early in .TuJy, and commenced at once the necessary practice, folJowing certain prescribed rnles deriЦed from the Smithsonian pamphlet and other authorities. The instrumental errors and the personal equations of the obsenиers were determined b,y careи ful oomparisons made before, during, and after tbe obser>atious in the fiehl, the obserrers returning with their instruments to l\fount Holly for the purpose. The hours selected for the obserYations were those which ham been found by experience to represent very nearly the mean of the twent_y-four hours, viz: 7 a. m .and 2 and 9 p. m.; or those at which the equilibrium of temperature is the most thorouglily establisl1ed, as at two hours after sunrise and about the time of sunset; or 9 a. m. and !J p. m. when the mercurial column would be equally too high and too low. The observations were not made at the triangulation station, but at the house nearest thereto at which the necessary accommodations and facilities could be found; and the difference of height between the surface of the mercury (or the barometrical station) and tlrn bench-mark or stub at the triangulation station was determined by the spirit-level, the line being Je,~eJed, as usual, in both directions. Every precaution was taken to secure uniformity of conditions at all the stations. The latticed frames for the dry and wet-bulb thermometers were alike in all respects, and were attached, in each ease, to the outside frame of a north window, second story, of the house occupied b;y the obserycr. The barometer was suspended inside, and one window of the room was always left open.

Table I gh-es the 1иes1llts of the comparisons made for determining the difference between the attached thermometers. Tile thermometers were read, one after the other, by each obsenиer, and a second comparison made after an interval sufficient to permit the mercury to recover from the temporary effect of the heat transmitted from the observer's body. The number of such comparisons by each observer is given in the table, and the. regularity of the mean differences at any one date is proof of the correctness of the observations. These comparisons show that No. 1730 differed from the other three, at each comparison, by a nearly uniform quantity, and as there is a greater probability that the temperature as generally indicated by the attached thermometer is rather higher than lower than that of the mercury iu tile cistern and tube, the diffemnce is subtracted from 1730, so that an four may read alike. For the correction to be applied to the observations taken in the field between the comparisons of July and A11gust, the mean 00.21 of the differences would be preferred, and, similarly, 0░.17 for the observations between the comparisons of .August and September. .As these two means, however, are so nearly alike, and certainly within the personal errors of the observers, we have adopted the uniform quantit;y of 00.2 as the correction to be subtracted from the thermometer attached to barometer No. 1730. The comparisons bet;ween the different dry and wet bulbs showed unimportant differences, considering the slight differences of elevation between the stations. The subjoined tal1le contains the comparisons made 'to determine the differences existing between the different barometers. The adjustments of the mercury in the cistern and of the иernier to the height of the column were made иimmediately after observing the attaehed thermometers, each obser,-er adjusting the four barometers, one after the other, and then reading them. The comparison was repeated at stated intervals, and, in every instance, the tube was inclined and the mercury and vernier re-adjusted. The relative instrumental differences at each date of the series of comparisons are nearly the same, while the quantities differ from one 9ate to the other by an aYerage of .0015 of an inch, a variation which would appear to be principally due to changes in No. 1730. These differences, however, do not include the personal error of the observers, and are not, therefore, the proper corrections to be applied to the .field -Observations. One observer ma.y adjust or read too high, a.nd another too low, and the resulting difference may either largely increase or entirely neutralize the instrumental error recorded in Table II.

The observations recorded in Table III were made simultaneousl,y, each obsen-er 'confining himself to his own instrument. By this means, a combination of both errors, instrumental and persona.I, was obtained. The table, therefore, gives the true differences to be used in comparing corresponding observations by any two observers in order to reduce them to the same standard.

REPOR'f OF TIIE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The attached thermometers were observed before the barometers were adjusted, but as it was upon trial that the sensitiveness of the thermometers from the proximity of the person of the observer was so much greater than t11at of the mercury in the barometer from the same cause, a correction of the recorded heights on account of the slight differences of temperature exhibited by the attached thermometers would produce a greater error in the above comparisons than its omission.. As previously stated, the conditions in regard to height, air, and light under which all the comparisons were made, were precisely alike for each instrument. It will be seen that, for the sake of convenience, the plus error 0░.2 of the thermometer attachetl to barometer 1730, has been coml:ined with the instrumental and personal error of that barometerи, and observer, and the correction applied, once for all.

'\\urdemann took his place, introducing another personal equation. The combined corrections resulting from the comparisons of August !) have been, thernfore, applied to the observations taken at the stations in groups A and B, and those from the comparisons of September 14 to the observations belonging to group 0. The mean e:ffect on any single result for a difference of height, caused lly an error of adjustment or reatling, may be stated as follows:

FIELD RECORD.

The comparisons having been completed and the watches compared and rated, the ollservers istarted for their respecti\иe stations, each with instructions in regard to the transportation and setting up of his instruments, and to the order and care into which the <let.ails of each observation should be can-ied out. As a security against errors of adjustment or reading, these observations, each one complete in itself, were taken at intervals of five minutes, the mean of which constituted the observation for the hour, as shown in the followiug transcript from the fi.el1l-book:

The difference in altitude iu uo case exceeded 387 feet, nor 'llas the distauce bet'lleen any two stations greater than tweuty-fi.ve and one-fourth miles. The couutry embraced witbiu the field of operations was comparatively le,иel, and the obserYations in each group were taken simultaneously and at a season the most fayorable for uniformity in the atmospheric pressure. ender these circumstances, the ol>senиations which were made at corresponding stations have been used for deter ruining differences of height without regard to the possibility of tllcre being a difference iu the hourly oscillation of the barometer and thermometer at the two stations. If, however, we lrntl adopted the Philadelphia table of hourly correctiomi, supposing them to be constant for the couutry and climate within a rmlius of fort.r miles of Girard College, the tlill'ereuces in height tletluced from the original antl corrected obsen-ations would ha\иe been identical for the reason that the corrections being a.pplie<l to the same hours at both station!', woultl neutralize each other. Hence, in order to make any such corrections really effoctive, in the case of simultaneous obse1Tations, it is uecessar.r that the amplitude of the diurnal oscillation at one station sbonkl tliffer from that at the corresponding station. If we now employ the obserrntions themselves t-0 <leterinine the hourly Yarfatiou at each station, we obtain a series of tables in which the correction for each hour is different, the differences ranging from .0002 to .008 of an inch. The application of these corrections would change the results for the <lifterent hours hut not the general mean, while on the other baud the results would be less harmonious. In the absence, therefore, of any extended series of obser\"ations at the difft>rent stations, the hourly osci11ation has been assumed to be the same for eacp. group and date, while tbe more im'. portant requirements, which were really within our control, of obsen-iug at the same moment ot time and at hours representing the daily mean, were strictly fulfilled. The correctness of the abo\'e assumption is confirmed by the fact that the mean of the fi\'e hours does not differ from the mean of the hours of 7 a. m. and 2 and 9 p. 'm.-taking the average of fifteen separate series-by more

than 0"'.15, tl.Ie greatel't difference being equiYalent to .OlH of an inch in the reading of the barometric column . .For the computations, we haye adopted Bessel's formula and Plantamonris tables, as giYen by Guyot in his "Meteorological and Phy8ical Tables prepared for the Smithsonian Institute," pages 72 to 80, series D. In regard, however, to the obserYations at present under discussion, it may be stated that the resulti11g difterences of height would be nearly the same, (in no case differing more than 15 inches,) whether they were obtained b;y the formnla and tables of LaPlace and Guyot, or by those of Bessel and Plantamour or Ruhlmann. Tables V to :X:XII, inclusirn, giYe the obserYations (reducetl to tl.Ie freezing point and corrected, for instrumental errors and personal equation) at the corresponding stations in each group, and the computed diffcrencc8 of altitude.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 11.
EXTRACT FROM A REPORT TO PROFESSOR BENJAMIN PEIRCE, SUPERINTENDENT UNITED STATES COAST SlJRVEY, RELATIVE TO A METHOD OF DETERMINING ELEVATIONS ALONG THE COURSE

OF A TIDAL RIVER, WITHOlJT THE AID OF A LEVELING-INSTRUMmrr.

In the course of my physical survey of the Hudson, I have reached the following method of measuring elevations from point to point, a method not yet thoroughly tested, but apparently very accurate as applied to the river now under examination, and very rapid: Set up graduated staves at such distances apart that the slacks of the tidal currents shall extend from one to another. By simultaneous observations ascertain the difference in the readings of these gauges at the slack between ebb and flood currents, and again the difference at the slack between flood and ebb, then apply theRULE.-The difference i1~ the elevations of the zeros of the gauges is equal to one-half the sum of the d{fferences of their readings at the tuиo slack 1mters. The explanation of this simple rule is equally simple. In a tidal avenue having no freshwater feeders, one will readily admit that the inertia-slopes at the two slacks will be equal and opposite. In a tidal river the observed slopes will also be equal, as measured from the horizontal; because the difference in the effects of the momenta of the two unequal drifts will balance the river-slope. By the term ''i1:er-slope, I mean the inclination of the surface of the river as it would be if tideless. You have called my attention to errors that must appear in the practical application of this rule to the case where the channel section varies from point to point; these I grant, but believe, in most cases, they must be inconsiderable. There are also small errors due to bends of the stream, to be canceled by a proper arrangement of stations, and errors resulting from "diurnal inequality," which may be canceled by a proper selection of dates, or by observing two pairs of slacks. My work comes out very well upon the Hudson, without taking any of these precautions; and I purpose to offer my rule as an addendum to my report on the "Reclamation of tide-lands," since it is likely to prove useful in connection with projects for the rectification of rivers, the weiring and diking of streams, &c. In the Hudson, I found that staves ten miles apart could be referred to each other by this rule, and that no nice current-observations were really necessary. The slope is so nearly constant about the time of slack water, that an error in this time of a half hour, in some cases, would be of no consequence. The ooiiwidenoe of tinie at the two gauges, and the careful reading of the heights, are the most important elements. I offer below an illustration from observations upon one of the fourteen reaches examined during the past month :
Slack, ebb to flood. Slack, flood to ebb.

Th(slope_at_slack water is opposed to the direction of the current which has just cease<l; in other words, the water, by иirtue of its inertia, runs up hill for some time before it is checketl. In the_case of the Hudson, the slacks occur near the time of half-tide, or when the surface of the stream is near its maximum inclination. In most of our harbors, the slacks occur near times of high and low~water, when the surfaces are nearly horizontal. In a later and fuller report I shall present a comparison of my results with those obtained from a line of levels previously run by officers of the Coast Survey along the Hudson R,iver Railroad. I sent a copy of the above notes to M. Stessels, hydrographic engineer of Belgium, who has been-_busy.for~several years, with distinguished success, upon a physical survey of the Scheldt (IJEscaut.) He responded immediately in a somewhat lengthy communication, and I feel bound to notice his criticisms, not only because I had designed to elicit ohjectionsi but also because his points are well stated. He says that my method is "very applicable in the lower part of the river, between Flessingue and Bath, owing to the small slope of surface during the slacks of flood and ebb; hut higher up, I should have little confidence, owing to the variations in the form of tlte diagram, and of the anomalies which the general slope presents и и "" и I consider it reliable so long as the slope remains small, i. so long as the mass of fresh water has 110 influence upon the [form of the] tide." This matter of the change of form in the-tidal curve we have discussed, but without sufficient data as yet. I haye supposed that my problem included this, but it remains _to be seen. Mr. Stessels closes his letter with the statement that "daring the winter I have no means of making observations which I can direct in person, but in the spring I shall have the tide obsei-ved, during slack waters, between Bath and Lillo, where an abrupt contraction modifies greatly the tidal phenomena; and I shall take pleasure in communicating to you my results." I too, with your consent, shall extend my survey into the upper reaches of the Hudson, where the fresh water element is large and where crooks and turns of the channel are more frequent. Very respectfully submitted. HENRY MITCHELL, Ohif;f Physical Hydtиography, United States Coast Smиvey.

RESULTS 01:' THE TELEGRAPHIC DETERMINATION OF THE LONGITUDE OF SAN FRANCISCO, CAL.

The longitude campaign of 1869 between Cambridge,' Massachusetts, and San Francisco, California, gave for the difference of longitude of the transit instruments at these stations3h 25m 7и.335 :l: 0и.006. This result is obtained: first, by a direct determination; second, by the intermediate station, Omaha; third, by the intermediate station, Salt Lake; and fourth, by the two intermediate stations Omaha and Salt Lake. The results here given are those from the first computation made by Mr. Isaac Bradford, and the probable errors take no account of the uncertainty of the personal equations. To refer the above difference of longitude from the west transit at Cambridge to the center of the dome of the observatory, we must add oи.04. The resulting longitude for the Cambridge Observatory (dome) from the telegraphic determination of 1866, still employed;at present, is 4h 44m 30и.95; hence telegraphic longitude of San Francisco astronomical.station in Washington Square, Sh 09m 381 .325. To compare our former results, depending on observations of moon-culminations, with the telegraphic result, we refer the latter geodetically to Presidio astronomic station, by.application of the reduction + 10░.81. Longitude of Presidio astronomic station by telegraph, 8 11 09m 49░.13; ;same from~fift.y-one moon-culminations observed in 1852, Sh 09m 47и.55 ▒ 0и.53; and from forty-eight moon-culminations observed in 1852 at Telegraph Hill, and referred to Presidio astronomic station by the reduction -11и.71, the latter longitude becomes Sh 09"' 46░.91 ▒ oи.66. The mean by the moon-culminations (Sh 09m 47и.23) is therefore 1░.90 too small when compared with the telegraphic result, and:this difference may be considered as representing \~ = 08 .06, nearly, of personal equation, by~which

Assistant Davidson obsened moon-culminations earlier than the Greenwich observers. ,The adopted geodetic longitude since 1852 was 811 09m 4.'iи, the result of twenty-one moon-culminations observed at Point Pinos in 1851, and of thirty-nine moon-culminations observed at Pointи Conception in 1850, both referred chronornetrically to Presidio. и Applying to the results of Mr. I. Bradford's computations the proper corrections due to differences of personal equations, and referring them to the dome at Cambridge, to the transits at Omaha and Salt Lake, and to the astronomical station in Washington Square at San Francisco, we have theи following comparative differences of longitude between Cambridge and San Francisco: 1.

ABSTRACT OP RESULTS FOR DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDES BETWEEN THE HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY, CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS, THE COAST SURVEY STATION, SEATON, ON CAPITOL BILL, AND THE liNITED STATES NAVAL OBSERVATORY, WASHINGTON, D. C., AS DETERMINED BY MEANS OF THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH, IN B67, BY THE UNITED STA.TES COAST SURVEY, WITH THE CO-OPERATION OF PROFESSOR JOSEPH ''r'INLOCK, DIRECTOR OF THE IHRVARD OBSERVATORY, AND COMMODORE B. F. SANDS, U.S. N., SUPERINTENDENT NAVAL OBSERVATORY.

The difference of longitude between Washington and Cambridge has hitherto depended upon the early determinations of Sears C. Walker, esq. Tliis value depended in part upon triangulation in consequence of there being at that time no telegraphic communication between New York and Jersey City, and the peculiar geological character of the valley of the Rudson lli,иer gave grounds for the suspicion of large station-errors. In иwashington, also, the telegraphic connection had been made not directly with the Naval Observatory, but with a station upon Capitol Hill, some three miles from there. The supe_rintendent accordingl;y determined, in 18tl7, to make a new determinaи tion of this important longitude, this time connecting the Naval Obsen-atory station and the Cambridge Observatory directly together. The co-operation of the two prominent observatories was obtained, and the time was obserrnd at these places by their own officers and according to their own methods. At the Cambridge Observatory :M:r. G. M. Searle observed for time with Simms transit, C. S. No. 8, of 4!-inch focal length, 2linch aperture and magnifying power 92. At the Seaton station Assistants G. W. Dean and E. Goodfellow obsen-ed for time with Though ton & Simms transit, C. S. No. 4, of 46-inch focal length, 2i-inch aperture, and magnifying power 96. ..A.t the Naval Observatory Professor S. Newcomb, Professor .A. Hall, and Mr. C. Thirion observed for time with the transit circle belonging to the observatory. It has an aperture of Sz inches, a focal length of 145 inches, and was used with a magnifying power of 186 diameters. Each station was furnished with a clock and a chronograph, and the method adopted for determining' the differences of local times was that of direct clock comparisons, each observer putting his clock in the connecting circuit, in succession, and according to programm~ previously agreed upon. Transit observations were made before and after the exchange of clock signals. The distance, by wire, between Cambridge and "\'\Tashington is four hundred and ninety-two statute miles, and between Seaton and the Naval Observatory at Washington about three miles. In the reduction of transits proper distinction was made between stars observed for instrumental corrections and stars observed for time.- The adopted right a~censions of stars depend on Dr. Gould's Standard Places, second edition.

1. DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN THE CAMBRIDGE .A.ND WASHINGTON OBSERVATORIESи .A.t Cambridge the probable error of a clock correction by a single star is ▒ oи.08. At "\Vashington the transits by different observers are reduced to Professor Newcomb's standard of observing, and the personal equation between him and l\Ir. Searle is found to be N - S = - oи.06 ::l: .005 ; a correction is applied for difference of personal eq nations to the Cambridge clock corrections, to give them as if they had been determined by Professor Newcomb. The probable error of a clock correction by a single star is ▒ oи.04. The following tables contain the differences of times (I. - x) deduced from the comparisons of eastern clock signals and the difference of times ( i.. + x) from the western clock signals.

NEW INVESTIGATION OP THE SEClJLA.R CHANGES IN THE DECLINATIOX, TIIE DIP, AND THEи JNTENSI'rr OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE, AT WASHIXGTON, D. c. [REPORT TO THE ASSISTANT rn CHARGE OJ<' THE OFFICE,_BY CHARI;Iи:S~A. SCHOTT, ASSISTANT.]
.JUNE

30, 1873.

The magnetic ousenиations at \Yashington, which are kept up chiefly for the purpose of ascerи taining the annual changes, and of furuisiling a base.station at which magnetic instrnments may be tested and their results compared, exteu<l at this time oYer a sufficient. range of years tv make it desirable to snbmit them to a new scrutiny respeeting the secular progression. и Nearly fourteen ;years h:we passed since the last general discussion of the secular change of the declination,"' and now tweke new Yalues of the declination lmYe been added to the six preYiи ously available. Since the last dh;cnssioa uf the secular changes iu the Llip,+ a rt.ffersal i11 the direction of the 111 otion has taken i1Iace, in consequence nf which unexpected cllange, the formulre, constructed seventeen years ago, no longer apply. Iu the place of seven obse1Tations, we ha>e now twenty. four available for the new discussion, lmt the time C<ffereil by these obseryatious is yet too short to admit of tbe)ntrodnction of fl periodic function to express the secnlar change.. Respecting tlie change in the horizoutal force, it was, in ISGJ ,t only possi blc to indicate the fact that the horizontal forne for placlиs on our .Atlantic coast had then for some ~иears been slowly decreasing, and to point out, approximately, the anunal amouut. "~e lrnsc now nineteen observa. tions in the place of thirteen iu lSGl, an<l ttre euabled to indicate the law of clumge during the period of obsernition. The horizontal force and the dip l1ccarne stationar.r abont the same time, an<l the tormer is now slowly increasing, while the latter is slightly decreasing. The obsenиations in the District of.Columbia extcnrl as far back as 1792, for the declination, but the earliest record I could find of the dip is of 183'.l, arnl of the horizontal force, of 1812. The greater numher of obsenиations were made on Capitol Hill, and all within the lines of the District. Special referenees t,o locality and obsernn' aml remarks wm be fonnd in Coast Srir,иe.r Report for 1869,.A1>pendix ~o. 9, pp. 19!J-207. Tile obscrnitions, commenced at my garden on Capи itol Hill in 1867, lmve becm continued to datP.

The probable error of a singlo representation is oo = ▒ 4'.9; for the last seven years the accordance is better, for the reason that all obseryations we.re made at the same spot (excepting the small shift in 1873.) lt is well known that the local disturbances in the db;trilmtion of magnetism within the District are of considerable magnitude. The annual variation e is given hy: I' = + 2'.98iJ sin (l.iJ n + filJO). The epoch of the last minimum (irest declination) is found to be 1786, when D = - 0. 0 11. The curve of no - declination, about the close of the last century, consequently passed to the northeast of "Washington.* It is probable that the declination will continue to increase, though with a diminishing rate, to the close of the ceutnry. The following tallle contains decennial yalues computed by the prececding formula.

Annual increase in 1870, 2'.4, and in 1880, 1 1.9. Secular change in tlte magnetic dip.-Of twenty-seven col1ectel1 results oul_y two were rnjectc!l on account of discordance, (one of 184iJ and one of 1866, when the results may have been affecte1l either by local attractionR or by defocth'-e needles,) and after uniting two sebi of obseryations with clift'erent needles, in 1871, there remained for discussion twent_y-four values. :My paper on the seenи lar change of the dip, written in 1856, led to the fixation of an epoch of minimmn dip in the year 1842; the obser\'ations made at иwashingtou in 1860 fil'St indicated a change in the direction of the annual progressive motion which was confirmed by the obseiTations taken at Eastport, Maine, and at Toronto, Canada. Supposing the dip to haYe heen generally diminishing, the existence of a subordinate period of' short duration appears to be indicated, which for a short time produced a small increase in the dip, the former diminution being afterwards re-eE<tablislte_d.

plausible oue; tllese thermal chauges must be considered to have a slow rate but operating on a vast scale, thus explaining the similarity of secular clrnnge extending over thousands.of miles, and going on perhaps for hundreds of years. As far as observed they appear of a mixed progressive and periodic character. Such thermal surfaces of equal heat may propagate themselves in any direction, and may he supposed compounded of a number of separate wares ltaYing different directions and periods, and producing correspouding effects 011 the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity. They are supposed, ultimately, to owe their origin to a transfer of matter disturbing the equilibrium of temperature and magnetism. Tims the influence which pmduced foe increase of the magnetic иzcest declination on our Atlantic coast waR first recognized in the northeast, extendjng itself in time toward the southwest; . the minimmn 1re.~i declination occurred at Portland, 1\Iaine, about 17-05, at Cambridge, Massachusetts, about 1783, at New York about 1795, at Savannah, Georgia, about 1817, at New Orleans, Louisiana, about 1831, and at the City of l\Iexico about 1838, appearing at the last three places as a maximum of east declination. Tile same influence will, possibly, soon .reach our Pacific coast, where, at present, the east declination is still slowly on the increase. Sub-periods or subordinate waves in tlle secular change have been recognized in the observed declinations at Cambridge, Massachusetts, at Hatboro, l'ennsylrania, (near Philadelphia,) and other places, and they are also noted in the observed dips at 'Yashingtou, and Toronto, Canada. Taking this view of the subject the phenomenon of the secular change is a complex one, and the numerical formulm designed for expressing it must, for the present, retain their tentative and hence provisional character, and they should not be used (eitller way) much beyond the time for which they are supported by obserrntions.

RESULTS OF OBSERVATIONS FOR DAILY VARIATIOX OF THE llfAGXETW DECLIXATIOX. )1ADE'AT FORT STEILACOOl\I, WASHI~GTON TElUUTORY, IX 18fjG, AXD AT CA~fl' DATE CREEK, AIUZO~A,'JX 1867, BY DAVID 1V.A.LKER, M. D., ACTIXG ASSISTANT Sl:RGEON, l:NITED STATES AmfY. [DISCUSSED AND REPORTED TO THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE OF THE COAST SLiffEY OFFICE, BY CHARLES A. RCHOTT, ASSISTANT COAST SCRVEY.]

.A duplicate record of these obser>ations was presented to the Uoast Suryey Officeи by Dr. \Valker, under date of Jnly 10, 1871, with the request that they be discnssedand published, if found of snfficient -.alue. The observations comprise hourly Lliff'ereutial readings of the position of a horizontal magnetic needle at Fort Steilacoom, Washington Territor,Y, from June 5 to August 31, 1866, and at Camp Date Creek, Arizona, from July Hi to No,иernber !?131 1867. The magnet was suspended by a fine untwisted thread of silk, adjusted to the normal direction of the magnetic meridian at eacll place. ~o special observations for torsion were made. The observations appear to have been carefully made, anrl are without a break in t!Jeir co11tinuity; an assistant observer acted under Dr. \\~alker's immediate superdsion. The value of such obsenations depends greatly upon their remoteness from other magnetic stations where the magnetic laws have alreatly been made out, and in the present case they will enable us to extend our knowledge of the Llaily variation O\'er a large area previously nnkumrn in this respect. The nearest stations where the laws of the daily variation have been studied from observations extenLling over a series of years are Toronto, Canada; Philadelphia, Pennsyh-ania; Key West, Florida; иand Sitka, Alaska. The two stations, Fort Steilacoom and Camp Date Creek, are about 1,030 miles apart, ancl the latter is at an PleYation of owr 3,700 feet abon~ the sea-le.el, which fact girns additional interest to .the results. It was deemed unnecessary to reproduce the indidclual readings, (they are deposited in the Coast Survey archi>es,) but it should. be stated that during the period co,-ered no unusua1ly large disturbances occurred; on the contrary, the needle appears to banи gиone through its mo>emeuts with great regula"'rity, for which reason no discussion of disturbances lras been attempted, and no readings have been excluded from the monthly means. The geographical position of Fort Steihtcoom I determine as follows: From tlie Coast Snneyи reconnaissance of Steilacoom Harbor, by Lieutenant Commanding J. ~~Iden, 17nitec1 States Na''Y, in 1856, it appears that the center of the parade ground is about 0'.68 north and 1'.83 east of the Methodist Church iu Steilacoom village; the latter position, by triangulation, is in latitnde 47░ 10' 20" and in longitude 1220 35' 50", hence, position of the fort, latitude 47░ 11' 01" and longitudeи 122░ 34' 00" west of Greenwich. Its elevation above the sea-leYel is stated by Dr. \Valker to be 250 feet. The magne.tic declination was :no 30' east, in 1s::rn, as communictttcd b)и S. Garfield, surveyor.general of 'Vashington Territory, and probably reached 220 00' cast, in IS(}(), the estimated annual increase being nearly 3'. The magnetic dip may be estimated at! 70~.0 и Tlie instrument was mounted and adjusterl in position at 10 a. m., June 5; it was 42 feet abo>e ground, in a location supposed free from any local attraction, and on a lernl prairie; soil-sandy gravel. The value of one division of the scale is 1'.006, as determined at Kmr; it appears, however, that at Fort Steilacoom and at Camp Date Creek these divisions were recorded as tenths, tbe proper nilue for thc.~e records is consequently 10'.06. The geographical position of Camp Date Creek is varionsl.r given aud subject to lllueli uncertainty in the absence of any (known) a+itronomical obsenatious: The meteorological reports at the Surgeon General's Office place it in latitude 340 45' ancl in longitude 1120 18'. On Coltou's new atlas, (edition of 1873,) it is situated in latitude 3to 16' and in longitude u 20 52', arnl on the United States Engineers' map, issued by the War Department, we 1intl it located in latitude 34░ 18' and in longitude 1120 40' west of Greenwieh, which last information is adopted for the present. Its elevation above the sea-Jevel is 3,726 feet a.s determined by a uoiling-point thermometer. The magnetic declination at this place I roughly estimate at 140 east, with perhaps an annual increase of 2'; the dip is probably near 6oao. The instrument was set up nuder a tent at 10 a. m., July Hi, 4.4 feet above ground; geological formation, basaltic Jani; no hills within three-fourths of a mile.

The above tabular results are exhibited graphically on tl.10 annexed diagrams. Considering that the Fort Steilacoom and Camp Date Creek '\'alues embrace but part of 11 si11gle cycle, whereas the Philadelphia values are means depending on a number of years of obserи vations, and considering that the epochs do not nearly correspoud to the same phase in the elernuyear cycle, during which the daily amplitude undergoes its changes of magnitude, the general correspondence in the daily movement and in the annual variation of the daily movement is snfliciently conspicuous. Supposing in the diagram the north end of the needle to point upwards when in its normal direction, its easterly de1lections are shown to the right, and its westerly deflections to the left of the medial Yertical line. The total variation at Fort Steilacoom (horizontal force about 4.2) is nearly the same as at Philadelphia, (horizontal force 4.17,) but at Camp Date Creek (horizontal force about 5.9) it is very much less, and not in the inverse proportion of the horizontal forces at the two stations. .At I 1'ort Steilacoom, during the summer months, the eastern elongation took place at Sa. m., (at Philadelphia at 7i a. m.,) and the western elongation at 2 p. m., (at rhiladelphia at 1-l; p. m. ;) the times of the daily extremes appear therefore somewhat delayed at Steilacoom. .A secondary westerly movement between 9! and 11 p. m. is almost masked by accidental irregularities. At Camp Date Creek the eastern elongation is reached at 7f a. m. in July and August, and a little before 8 a. m.. in the autumn months, (about the same as at Philadel11bia,) and the western elongation shortly before 1 p. m., (about the same time at Philallelphia ;) the secondII.

HEPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

ary movement is more decided than at Fort Steilacoom, and seems to commence soon after sunset, attaining its westerly maximum about 10 p. m. and 1 a. m.; in summer and autumn, respectively, it forms part of the annual -variation, and appears also in the Philadelphia curves of the daily variation. It will be observed that the mean of the readings of tlrn principal elongations of the daily variation will not represent. the average direction for the day, (lacking a correction of less than 1',) owing to the fact of the eastern extremes l.Jeing mnch more strongly developed than the v;estern.

No. 16.

REPORTS OF OilSEHVATIONS UPON THE TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE OF DECE:'IIIlER 22, 1870. (Decemlier 21, Washington astronomical time.)

Co.A.ST SURVEY OFFICE, May 1, 1871. Sm: Having been appointed a member of your party for_ observing, i11 Sicily, the ecli1ise of tlle sun of December 22, 1870, I joined you at New York, on board the steamer Algeria, October 13. The special duty assigned me, besides the direct obscrrntions of the eclipse, was the determination of the geographical position of the central station occupied by the Sicilian party. For this purpose I provided myself with a meridian telescope, (as described in Appendix No. 8, Coast Survey Heport of 1867,) to be used for finding the time and latitude, also for observing the eclipse; I had also a small theotlolite for local triangulation, a lland-telescopc, and a sidereal chroи nometer, rated at Washington; this box-chronometer I carried by hand, going and returning, not trusting it to the care of any one. The instruments, together with a number or cases containing the spectroscoflic outfit of the English party, under the direction of l\Ir. J. N. Lockyer, were shipped from Liverpool direct to 1\Iessina, care of our consul, Mr. F. W. Behn. Special arrange> ment had been made to insure their safe transportation, and they reached their destination in good condition. On the way from J,ondon to Florence frequent chronometer comparisons were made, ll"ith a view of testing the performance of your two pocket-chronometers. At Munich 1 assisted in the purchase of some hand-telescopes and other small instruments. By the courtesy of the directors of the respective obsen-atories, I was able to obtain comparisons of my sidereal chronometer with the clocks at the observatories at Berlin, Munich, aJHl Naples. On my return from Sicily I again compared the chronometer with the Naples clock. For the purpose of selecting a snitable locality for our observations of the eclipse at Catania, I left you at Florence, No,-ember 29, and arri'"ed at Catania December 5. \Vith the assistance of the consul, the instruments arrived from Messina, by rail, the same day. On the following day no suitable locality was found, but on the 7th, with the assistance of our vice-consul at Catania, Mr. A. Peratoner, and at the suggestion of Professor Orazio Silvestri, t;he garden of the Benedictine monastery of Sta. Nicola, situated iu the western part of the city, was found to be a most desirable location, and was accordingly selected for our station. Upon the arrival of the photographic instruments and outfit of our party, on the 11th, I mounted the transit, on the following day, in the southeastern corner of the garden, by the side of the photographic t~mt. Subsequently the English observers, under J\Ir. Lockyer, located themselves in the western portion of the garden. On the 7th Dr. C. II. F. Peters arrived, and on the 9th I Tisited with him Carlentini, south of Catania, and nearerи to the central line of the shadow. The station was afterward occupied by Professor J.C. Watson. The meridian instrument was mounted on its packing-box, which had been filled with blocks of lava, the weight of which was sufficient to render it sufficiently steady. At the close of each night's observation, the telescope was dismounted, but the frame was left standing, covered with f1 piece of oil-tlloth, to protect it against rain and dust. A meridian.mark was put up, and a small geodetic survey was made to connect the station with the triangulation of this part of Sicily, exи ecuted about thirty years ago, by Dr. Peters. The position of the station is referred to the center of the dome of the church of Saint Nicholas. The elevation of the ground of the garden above the sea-level was found to be nearly 40 meters, by repeated measures with au aneroid barometer, the scale of which had been tested. The results for 1oeal time, from observationsи with the meridian telescope No. 9, are as follows: Correction (1JT) to sidereal chronometer, Kessel, 1287.
DEAR

*In recording most of these observations, as well as those for latitude, I was assisted by Mr. Vi. Eimbeck, who arri vetl ou the 15th.

By means of Agnello'st map, I obtain for the position of Professor Watson's station at Carlentini, approximately, Jatitnde 37░ 161 lG'', longitude Gli Sm 13".7 (east). A daily record of the weathe;и was kept while in Sicily; it was fair enough until the day lll'eceding the eclipse, when a change occurred, bringing on clouds and occasional rain. .Early in tlie day, December 22, the sky, to a great extent, was clear, bnt as the morning advauced clouds ap1wared from the northward and westward, which unfortunately, during the time of the eclipse, became so dense as almost to hide thew hole phenomeuon from our vie~'. I3eyond noting the time of the first contact, and recording the impression of a momentary glimpse of a portion of the corona through a rent in the clouds, little more could be done. The phenomena of the two inner contacts, and of the last contact, were not obsen-able, on account of the presence of the dark-lllue clouds. Some rain fell for a short time. A little before the predictetl time of beginning, Mr. Lockyer caused a pistol to be discharged, noted by me at 1211 32m 11".0, by Kessel 1287, and about 1! seconds later a second shot "-as heard, intended, I believe, to indicate the time of the first observed spectroscopic contact of the moon's limb with the outer chromosphere. At this time and until 12h 32m 25" I could see no change in the sun's outline at the place where the first contact was expected, the limb being very irregnlar and wavy. About 12h 32111 25" I supposed tlrn moon hacl advanced upon the sun, llut waited till 12h 32m 29и.5, when it was evident the moon hacl mmle a perceptible indentation; I then pulled the string connectecl with the photographic equatorial and exposed the first plate of the eclipse. At 12h Mm 26и.5, the moon came in contact with the umbra of the first large spot, and at 13h Olm 01".5 with that of the second spot. At 1311 30111 heav,y clouds passed rapidly over the sun, and at 1311 .JOm drops of rain fell. At 13h 55m 55и the snn was again obscurecJ., but at lJh mm ;j5и a rent in the cloud revealed the eastern and northern part of the corona (about 120░ of the lunar circumference) for about 3 seconds. This part of the corona had a sharp outline, nearly concentric with the moon, except on the northeast, where it extended to a greater distance ; its aYerage width was estimated at one-third of the moon's radius. There was no gradual shading off and no long rays as was noticed at Springfield, Illinois, during the total eclipse of August 7, 1869. The color was of the same silvery white. No protuberances were seen with the naked eye. The color of tl1e sky near the southern and eastern horizon :j: was of a light orange-yellow, considerably brighter than the yellow tint as seen at Springfield; the clouds oYerhead were of a deep indigo blue, with purple shades i altogether the darkness was much less than that witnessed at Springfield, so that at first I could

Norman Lockyer, so distinguished for his spectroscopic discoveries in the sun. I wish here to express my obligations to him for his suggestions and attentions. I was by him introduced to the eminent optician, Mr. John Browning, of London. After consultation with the latter upon what I wanted, he engaged to make for me one of his direct vision sun spectroscopes. The construction of this and of all the other instrumental appliances for the occasion was at my own cost. My aim was primarily to have the spectroscope so mounted upon, or iu connection with, au equatorial movetl by clock-work, that it could be revolved with reatlyfreedorn around the center of the sun's image, as a center of revolution, the slit of the spectroscope always spanning the coronal ring radially from the snu's limb outward, aml of course sweeping the entire ring. This aim was, in great measure, already auti11ipatetl in J\fr. Browning's arrangement. The only modification by myself in tl1is respect was designed merely for greater security, both of the precision and of the perfect freedom, of the motion of revolution of the spectroscope system. In case there shonld appear one or more condensed masses of white light, similar to the two noticed by myself in the eclipse of 18G9, it was not improbable that such a condensation might be marked by a local comparative brilliancy in the bright line in the spectrum of the corona. And with sufficient power in the spectroscope, it was also a possible contingency, especially if such bright line coincide with a dark line in the skylight solar spPctrurn, that such local brilliancy of the line might be visible some minutes before and after the total phase, in the same way that Messrs. Lockyer and Janssen brought out the red hydrogen line in the absence of all eclipse. Tllis might altogether give a considerable period of time, and it was thought desirable to provide a means for recording with approximate exactness the position of any such condensation of light at three several recorded times, in case it should appear in the spectrum some minutes before totality. And if this should be otherwise, I still very much desired to locate with some precision -what should be seen in the total phase. These views I st.ate now, partly by way of apology for having run the risk of failure by undertaking more than could be accomplished with ease 'and certainty in the time at my disposal. The consequence was that several untoward circumstances and unexpected accidents prevented the completion of the arrangements, so that when the eclipse came they were iu large part not ready for use. '.l'he parts brought actually into use for service on the eclipse consisted of the sun spect1иoscopc, matle for me by l\ir. Browning, as above mentioned, of the Coast Suney 4-inch Dollond telescope, of 6 feet focal distance, and of a temporary equatorial mounting, on which both these were supported. This equatorial mounting was specially arranged for the circumstances of the eclipse in Sicily, and gave a direct rigid support in declination to the object-glass of the telescope. The stellar focus of the object-glass fell within two or three inches of the northern cylindrical bronze pivot of the equatorial axis, and upon this pivot was directly supported the chief one of the pair of bronze bearings, :fixed in the telescope-tube, on which the spectroscope system could be frerly revolved. This special and temporary arrangement was resorted to -with the view of insuring tbe telescope against shake in manipulating the spectroscope, and this purpose it served effectually. The angle of aperture of the collimator of the spectroscope was much larger i:han that of ollr 4-inch Dollond of 6 feet focus, having been first intended for a different telescope. In order, therefore, to enlarge this small angle of aperture of the telescope and make it fill that of the collimator of the spectroscope, there was mounted in the s1lectroscope system, so as to revolve with it, a comи bination of a small plano-convex lens of lk inches focal distance, with a small plano-concarn lens of one-half inch focal distance, placed at a distance from the plano-convex equal to the difference of their focal distances. The pencils from the object-glass, traversing first the plauo-convex and tlle11 the piano-concave, came to their foci at the slit of the spectroscope at something over one eighth of an inch beyond the piano concave. In this way such of the telescopic pencils as tritveiиse<l this combination, embracing afield of over 13 minutes in diameter, arrived at the slit of the spe?troscope as if they had come from a 4-incb object-glass of 32 incbes focal distance. Of course the ~ntro~lnc tion of these lenses was in itself oujectionahJe, but for the occasion there was no ~t!Jer ch01ce, ~mce the gain in intensity of light by enlargement of the angle of peucil, and rcdnct10n to f~nr-nmtbs in the linear extent of the telescopic image, was much greater than the loss by refl.cct10n of the four additional surfaces. H. Ex. 112--lG

122

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

In view of the shortness of the time, I left the spectroscope entirely to Mr. Browning, tlie maker, confining myself to the arrangement of some of its accessories. The instrument proves to be one of the first order of excellence, but I will remark that it is not as large and powerful an instrument as I had in mind in designing my plans of observation. It contains two bundles of prisms, each bundle consisting of three prisms of Chance's heavy flint-glass, and four reverse prisms of crown-glass, all cemented together. The angle of dispersion of a like bundle tried at l\fr. Browning's was found to be not far from mid way between the angle of dispersion of one and that of two prisms of common flint-glass of G0░. The angle of dispersion of the two bundles is, therefore, supposed to be about equal to that of three prisms of common flint-glass of 600, The breadth of the transmitted pencil of rays of any one refrangibility in nearly the whole of the visible spectrum, is, in the air, about four-tenths of an inch along the plane of dispersion, so that in analyzing power the two bundles togetlier represent a common flint-glass prism of 600, measuring 2 inches on its sides. .As the Iluygenian eye-piece furnished with the little telescope of the spectroscope was of somewhat low power, I bad an extra Ramsden eye-piece of greater power provided, and have used it exclusively. With this the little telescope gives a power of about 9, being a little over 20 for one inch in effective width of aperture. The little teleseope is mounted on pi\'ots, so as to sweep the lengtll of the spectrum . .Anxious to have the means of trying the effect of multipl;ying the dispersion of the instrument, I devised, and had made, an artifice by which the light could be passed three times through the two bundles of prisms. This would irrrnlve a reduction of one-half in the quantity of light by division of the pencil, and a further reduction from loss by reflections and absorption. In these losses the light of the continuous spectrum would share in common with any monochromatic light; besides this, tbe continuous spectrum would suffer from the trebled dispersion a threefold reduction of intensity, in which the bright line of the monochromatic light would not share. иwhether the reи sult would favor the eye in analyzing the latt~r from the former, would obYiously depend on the sufficiency or insufficiency of the original intensity of the latter. There was not time before the eclipse to perfect the adjustment of this contrivance and remedy a defect which existed in it. It was, therefore, thrown out entirely, but it may be as well to describe it. It will recall the methods by which the English philosophers and our own Professor Young have made the light pass twice through the prisms. But in the element by which the light is passed through the third time, it is, I think, new, and though objectionable in placing glass surfaces very near a focal image, may yet receive other applications which I purpose to communicate on another occasion. For ease of verbal description, imagine the spectroscope to be placed with the line of collimation of its collimator, horizontal, and its plane of dispersion, or plane of sweep of its telescope, vertical, and, of course, the slit of the collimator horizontal. The whole half of the slit on the one side of the axis or line of collimation of the collimator is to be closed. The slit, for the remaining half of its length on the other side of the axis, is left open for the admission of light as usual. .A pencil of rays of any one refrangibility, issuing from any one point in this line of light, will pass through the prisms as parallel rays and continue on in the usual manner until they arrive at the object-glass of the little telescope. But before the pencil enters the object-glass one-half of it meets a semicircular planereflector, attached to the end of the telescope, so as to cover one of the halves into which the objectи glass is divided by a vertical diameter. Aud the plane of this reftector is normal to the axis or line of collimation of the little telescope. The other half of the pencil, going through the uncovи ered half of the object-glass, reaches the eye of the observer, who sees, deprived of half its light, the usual spectrum vertically spanning, say the right-hand half of his field of view. As the vertical width of the half pencil is undiminished, the increase of diffraction, it is supposed, will fake place solely along the lines of the spectrum, and not at all across them. The same remark applies to the reflected half of the pencil, whose course it remains to trace. The little telescope can be moved in it;s vertical sweep until its axis and the normal of the planeиreflector have the same inclination to the horizon as the pencil of the one refrangibility, and this last has to them only its small incliи nation in azimuth. The consequence is that it is returned through the prisms and collimator in. such a manner that all the pencils of the same refraugihility would form upon the closed half of the slit a reflected image of its open half, and extending above aud below would be a doublyи

magnified image of the neigh\Joring parts of the spectrum. But just l:efore tlte reflected half pencils come to.their several foci in the reflected double spectrum, they encounter, first the conyex surface, and next the plane surface, of a plano-convex lens, whose stellar focal length is rougltly equal to that of the collimator itself. The part of the lens before the open lmlf of the slit should be cnt away, to prevent the reflection and scattering there of a portion of the intense light of the slit. At the plane surface of the lens the half pencil enters, cemented to that surface, a rightи angled reflecting glass prism. The right-angled edge of the prism, opposite to the side l1y which it is eemented to the lens, is set baok between the jaws of the slit until it lies nearly coincident with the closed half of the slit itself. The lens causes any ray which comes from the center of the collimator object-glass to return to that ceuter after its two reflections from the prism, and the half pencils which come from one side the yertical diameter of the object-glass are re-.ersed horizontally and thrown to the other side on their return, and so, making a third transit through the prism, they pass thPOugh the open half of the object-glass of the little telescope, and the observer sees a trebly-magnified spectrum vertically spanning the left-hand side of his field of view as the primary one does the right. It is to be remarked that the \'ertical spectrum which would be formed by the half pencils arriving at the right-angled prism is imиerted, in consequence of the two reflections from that prism, and this is essential, since otherwise the third dispersion would lle subtracted from the first two instead of being added. For the equatorial motion au extemporized clock-work was devised, on a plan adrnittiug of ready and easy construction, with due regard to precision, and a meehanic in London was employed to make it, under an engagement to hine it read.v hy the 20th of ~ovemhcr. \Vhen I came to leaYe for Sicily, in tlie beginning of December, part of this work was still not done, and part of the remainder required doing over. Iu consequence I had to take it иwith me incomplete, in addiи tion to a supply of tools, with the hope that 1 might find time to finish it myself, at my station. But to my great vexation, on the day of the eclipse the clock-work failed to come into use, for the want of only a few hours more of time, aud my only resource was an assistant to shift the instrument little by little in right ascension. For this service I had to rely on my interpreter, who, though unpracticed, soon learned to perform the duty in a manner more satisfactory than might haYe been expected. The regulator for tbe clock-work was a pendulum suspended by a small steel wire several feet in length, so as to admit of motion in a circular orbit, maintained by a radius-bar at the end of the clock-train, in the manner now well known. Airy was, I think, the first to apply the pendulum in this way for this purpose. At the beginning of the clock-train was placed a brass windlass, some 1~ inches in diameter, to be driven hy a very small iron wire, acted on in its turn by a circular arc of wood, attached to the equatorial in such manner as to be almost connected with the object-glass of the large telescope. Into the clock-train entered also a brass wheel of some 7 inches in dianneter, acting, by a second fine iron wire, upon a second brass windlass, one purpose of this being to mitigate the effect of inaccuracy in gear-teeth. Had there been time, it was in contemplation to connect with this last-mentioned windlass by an extra iron wire a fillet of paper some 6 or 7 inches in width, which would thus be mnved, at the rate of about an inch in one minute, over a small table at the hand of the obser'\'er. The width of the fillet was intended as a scale of heights above the sun's limb, at about one inch to one minute of arc. In case of the occurrence of any strongly localized mass of light in the corona, such as I myself saw in the elipse of 1869, and in case of its being tra-0ed by a. powerful spectroscope in advance of the totality, the height from the limb, and the time, could both be instantly recorded together by a pencil-mark, against which, immediately after, could be entered, upon the fillet, theи line or lines of the spectrum. I need hardly add here that the aim of this mode of observing would be, by repeated observation of the same object, to trace, if possible, the presence or absence of indications of planetary motion. I had made at Mr. Browning's a micrometer arrangement of a glass prism of very small angle; but as this was only resorted to in the hurry of the occasion, on account of the facility with which

124

it furnished a micrometer scale, mechanically transferable to the paper fillet, and is objectionable, on the score of its reflecting surfaces, I will not go into the details. As it failed to come into nsc, I need not say it was excluded on the occasion of the eclipse. On the day of the eclipse I spent much of the forenoon in an effort still to get the clock-motion ready, the length of the pendulum having been calculated as nearly as practicable. But it became manifest that it was impossible, and I prepared to observe with such means as were ready. The large telescope having been set approximately to the declination of the sun's center, my Italian asи sistaut in a short time learned to follow the sun's diurnal motion, at signal given, with very tolerable success. An extemporized brace was applied in such a manner as to hold the telesco1)e free from shake. In the matter of aujusting the wiuth of the slit of _the spectroscope, I deferred to the judgment and great experience of l\Ir. J. Norman Lockyer, the distinguished head of the English expedition, who \\'as at the same station, and who did me. the favor to make the adjustment upon the skylight spectrum. This adjustment remained unaltered till after the totality. As already intimated, the slit of the spectroscope was placed radially to the sun. A.s the eclipse advanced, the spectroscope system, while clouds did not interfere, was revol>ed continually to and fro, so as to sweep: with the radial slit the entire convex limb of the solar crescent, enabling me to watch the diurnal motion, and t-0 make an occasional rectification of the telescope in declination. As the time of totality approached I began to carry the slit a little beyond either cusp, where nothing remained but the mixed spectra of the sky and corona, but I noticed nothing which I could not see iu the skylight spectrum at auy time. It may be remarkable that the red chromospheric line did not catch my eye. But in Yiew of the fact that repetition of these trials was speedily cut off by clouds, and in view also of the possibility and probability that the very brilliant full sunlight specи tram left th(eye out of condition by the persistence of its impression, I attach very little weight to~this negative result. Had my arrangements been completed, the sun's image was to have been screened out without excluding the light external to its limb. As it now became evident that the total phase was to be lost in an extensive mass of cloud, I turned from the instrument and gave myself to a general survey of the interesting scene around me. The sky in the west was clear to a considerable height above the horizon, of which I had an unobstructed view in that quarter. I watched for the rising of the dark curtain, an appearance mentioned as having been seen by some on the approach of the shadow in the eclipse of 18G9. The phenomenon in question was not, however, perceived on this occasion, and subsequent re:flecи tion suggested that the smaller diameter of the shadow gave less reason to expect it. 'l'he change of the western skylight to the rich ruddy glow _which it exhibited, with no distinctly noticeable change, through the whole of the totality, and with a degree of luminosity equal, for aught I can say, to that of evening twilight 30 or 40 minutes after sunset, was quite gradual. The illumination of the landscape around was, I should say, far greater than in the light of the full moon, though very different in the whiteness of the latter. Every object in the landscape continued to be seen with ease and distinctness, much more so than in the moonlight. It is not unlikely that some of this effect might be due to the absence of the deep shadows of moonlight. At one moment during totality a glimpse of the corona came out through a partially hazy opening in the clouds for a period which I thought did not exceed two seconds. I think it will be to no purpose to state the impression which I got of it under such circumstances. After the sun again came out, I now took the first available opportunity I had had to test the spectroscope on the full sunlight. Closing up the slit on the solar image I had the satisfaction to see the lines of the solar image come out with a splendor of definition that fully evinced the skill of the maker. My station was in the gardens of the Convent Benedetti, at Cataniaи .Among the 'f'arious arrangements contrived on the voyage to Liverpool, but which could not be attempted, I will briefl.y mention one in which the observer, without taking his eye from the spectrosoope, can by a single movement instantly throw ont the prisms and the slit, a rellector taking the place of the former, and disclose to the eye a full view of the object, with the position

of the slit marked by a pair of spider-lines. I see that Professor Young has a different arrangement for accomplishing, with similar facility, tl10 same purpose. Uespectfully submitted. J. llOJ\lEU LANE. Professor BENJMHN PEIRCE, Superintendent of the United Statci; Eclipse E.x1J1:dition.

\\'ASIII.NG'J'ON, June 30, 1873. DEAR SIR: The following is m,y report on the obser\'ations of the total eclipse of the sun on December 21, 1870. In accordance with your directions I went to Catania to obsenиe the eclipse. I was to have observed it with the same spectroscope antl telescope with which I observed the eclipse of 1869, but fitted with Professor Winlock's attaclunent for recording the position of tllc spectral lines. Unfortunately, owing to a mistake with whicll I was in no way concerned, this instrument was dispatched to Spain, and the circumstance was not discovered in time to get the instrument or to go to it. l\Ir. Adams, of the English expedition, was good enough to lend me an eyepiece with a Savart polariscope. I fitted this to a telescope which I found among the instruments of our own party, in order to obsenиc the uature of the polarizrition oft.he corona. I was stationed at the \illa of the Marquis di S~n Giuliano, some three miles behind Catania, on the road to Etna. The weather was remarkably clear in the morning, but a storm blew up at the time of the eclipse, and it was raining during the total }lhase, at least at the beginning of it. Fortunately, a Yery :,;;mall opening occurred in the clouds, so that the obseryations could be ma<lc, although under disadvantageous circumstances. I had previously tested tile telescope for polarization, and found none perceptible. The plan was to set first upon the dark face of the moon and turn the 1){)lariscope so that the bands disappeared, and then observe the position angle (from the center of the moon) of that part of the corona on which the bands attained their maximum. I observed two parts of the corona, differing 180░ iu position angle, and found the plane of polarization to be about 6░ from the radirtl position, being more nearly vertical. The parts obsen"ed upon were 650 and 1450 from the vertex towards the east in position angle. '.l'he measures were made upon a part about six: or seven minutes from the limb. The measures both of the position of the plane of polarization and of position angle were recorded by scratches upon the lacquer of the eye-piece, the edge of the polariscope affording the means of measuring the latter. Yours, very respectfully, C. S. PEIRCE. Professor BENJAMIN PEIRCE, S11perintenilent Coast Surrey.

Report of Mtиs. Charles S. Peirce.
DEAR Sm: Jlrly duty as a member of the United States Coast Survey Expedition to the l\Iediterranean for observing the eclipse of 1870, was to sketch the corona, and I will premise that my knowledge of drawing extends merely to outlinings and shading single objects. That is, I cannot group a landscape rapidly and effectively, but any one object in a landscape I believe I can copy with great accuracy. After we arrived at Catania, Mr. Lockyer, of the English expedition, kindly lent me a copy of the twelve observations, more or less, which he had drawn up, as being important for the sketchers to make, and these I conned diligently. I also heard, through Professor Peirce, that l\Ir. Lockyer was advising his sketchers to practice from pictures of former coronas, pinned up on the wall, and to see how many outlines they could dash off in a given time. I immediately acted upon this hint, but the only copy of a corona of wliich, mi it happened, I could have the use, was one of a former eclipse by Padre Sccchi, with what, I must think, exaggerated rays and streamers radiating out from it in all directions. This I pipned high up on my bed-ha.nfiings, and copied endless times, by first drawing circles on my paper, and quartering them,

126

REPORT OF THE SUPER.INTENDENT OF

and then, always begiuniug at the left-hand upper quarter, I went through the upper half of the pictured corona, and afterwan1, starting at the left-hand lower quarter, I carried tlte lower half round to meet the upper. I also practicml sketching as mpitlly as possible the outline of any object that my eye fell upon casually, aml I drew frequently the ever-changing steam-cloml that rolls continually out of Etna. Seccbi's picture, however, consisting, as it did, principally of very strongly marked rays, my attention became fixed on the idea of rays, or streamers, and these I was determined, if there were any, to see. The post of observation of our party was at a villa of the l\Iarquis di San Giuliano, about two miles from Catania. The road to it was that also to Etna, and therefore up-hill all the way. The villa m"erlooked the valley in which lay Catania and its harbor, and which, set in a wide, encircling frame of mountains on the eastern and western, and of open sea, stretching to the center, horizon, made the most enchanting landscape possible to behold. I was placed at a window in :'!, room of the second story, commanding this view, and wit.h the sun a little to my right hand. Other reports will, no doubt, describe the sudden change in the weather, which, after foe eclipse hatl begun, converted the most blue and brilliant of skies into one which was covered with clouds. As the eclipse progressed these clouds became denser, and when the sun was nearly covered, they fairly serried themselYes into a black wall and hid the phenomenon completely from sight, rain and hail falling at the same time, and a chill blast blowing. Neither the lady with me, nor I, had any watch, and I was convinced, so long the minutes seemed, that the totality and the rain were simultaneous, when suddenly the cloud broke, and left a little lake of clear sky, in which the sun, now nearly extinguished by the black moon, was exhibited as in a frame. Lest it should prove too dark for me to see to draw, I bad been provitlcd with a lantern, but, in my despair of the moments before, I had mechanically blown the candle out, as being no longer needed. Instantly I was nervout>ly anxious to light it again, but the wind was blowing in so strongly from the open window that this was a difficult operation, and while I was struggling to accomplish it, with my eyes down on my table, in a flash, a crimson, almost bloody, light fell upon my llaper, throwing black shadows, and I lifted my eyes to the sun just in time to see what I suppose to have been tlie "Baily's beads," and to catch in the upward sweep of my glance a most tantalizing glimpse of the color-transformation in the clouds, which lined the horizon over the sea and ti.Jc mountains, and which, in the lurid light, looked as unearthly as dancing witches. Up to this point, I had steadily watched the landscape, but had seen nothing in the changes of the light more remarkable than the usual appearances of a greenish-black thunder-storm. Indeed, I have seen effects of that kind much more striking than those of this occasion. The color-tints at the instant of the Baily's beads, or vanishing point, however-eould one have had thought and eyes for onl~и that-must have been altogether exceptional and peculiar to an eclipse. I, at least, never saw anything approaching the strange and weird effects which that upward glance impressed en passant upon my vision. I had been told to take one look at the corona, as a whole, before beginning to draw, and I did so; But as I ne'\er should ventur.e to draw from memory, I am only sure of a thing if I copy it directly from the o~ject. I did not dare to linger over this glance. It was but a second, and most disи appointing. The bright halo of the corona immediately surrounding the sun was much narrower than I bad supposed, and, as I remember it, it was not pure white, but faintly yellowish, though I can hardly believe that this latter impression is from anything but an imperfect and agitated memory. It, the halo, lost itself suddenly in a confused brightish sUITounding that seemed to me a. golden mist, so that my belief was, and almost is, that I was looking at the whole thing through a cloud. Let all this, however, go for nothing, since it was too momentary to be correct. I began to draw, and, even as I had practiced from my pictured corona, I began at the lower side of the left-hand upper quarter and passed round through the right-hand upper quarter. But I could see no bright rays such as I had been copying, only a radiation of dark lines over the bright halo, a few of which I put down as seen in my drawing, just to show the character of them, not as portraits of individual lines. Indeed, I said to myself that it was of no use to try to draw them, because there was, O'f I thought there was, a cloud over the corona comprising them. I soon turned

THE

127

my eyes and my pencil, therefore, to the lower left-hand quarter. иwhat was my astonishment to find here, not a long and broad bright ray, wide at the base and narrowing to a point, as in Secchi's corona, but a long, dark, or rather delicate gray or steel colored ray, narrowest at the sun and widening as it went out, whicll entirel.r crossed the bright halo, and ceased or lost itself only on the very outside edges of the hazy envelope be,yon1l. I put it in its place exactly as it appears in the drawing, and going farther round the diameter, found a more delicate and shorter one about half: way between the two lower quarters, and, further on still, a still shorter one in the upper part of the right-hand lower quarter, and then the eclipse was o>er, and I had had no time to Yerify my observation on the lower half, or to scan once more the upper half, in order to see whether there were not somo dark rays there which I might have ornrlooked. So very delicate was the tint of these rays, so lost in the geucral halo, antl so short was the time, that I doubt, had I not happened to haYe my attention fixed on the idea of rays alone, whether I should haYe disco>ered them at all. Kot one of l\Ir. Lockyer's other twelve questions, by the way, crossed my mind for a moment; nor could they ha ye been answered if they had. The time is too brief, the noyelty too complete, and the agitation too great, I am conYinced, for a person observing an eclipse for the first time, to see trnly more than one point in it. I bad not time to allow myself to look at any of the accompanying phonomena, the stars, the ligllt on tbe landscape, the width of the corona as compared with the diameter of the dark moon, the sphericity of the latter, anything. As a whole, tbe phenomenon was completP.ly lost upon me, and all I brought away with me, all that I can youch for in' what I did see, are my three dark rays. They reminded me somewhat of the way the dark beam across the air looks when the sun is, what tile country people call "drawing water,'' behind a cloud. l\fy first thought in regard to them was, that they were shadows from mountains on the back of the moon, and hence the reader will perceiYe that tlie dark rays had something the look of a shadow thrown across a luminous object. I remembered that all the photographs (not drawings) I had seen of eclipses had a decided notch in the outline of the corona, about the neighborhood of my first dark ray, which induced me to think that the appearance might be something permanent. Professor Peirce thought that the observations of the dark rays was new and might be important. I mentioned it to one or two of the scientific gentlemen then in Catania, but they listened as if they thought my imagination had as much to do with my impression as the fach::, and it was not until we got to London and heard about the comparison of Professor Winlock's and .Mr. Brothers's photographs in regard to tlrn position of these >ery rifts, that I felt sure I had seen anything worth seeing. Mr. Lockyer, in one of his published comments on the eclipse in Nature, said, I beliew, that "none of the sketchers in Sicily had seen the rift." I was in the hotel with l\Ir. Lockser, but he had not thought it worth while to ask me what I had observed, and I did uot like to volunteer the information, especially as the English parties in Catania and upon Etna bad been depriyed by the rain of seeing the eclipse at all. In future eclipses it would, perhaps, be well that every two sketchers should take one poiut between them. Thus they will have time to make a definite obseryation of value, and to correct each other by comparing notes. Had it not been for the photographs, my obscrYation would har<lly have been credited. Yet, Professor Winlock's photograph so nearly bears out my observation of the position of the dark rays on the lower half of the corona, that I can feel no cloubt that I reallr saw what I have here attempted to picture and describe. The drawing represents the eclipse as it appeared to tlie naked ese, and the nrtical direction is up and down on the sketch. Yours, very respectfully, ZINA FAY PEIIWE.

REPORT OF 'l'HE SUPERINTENDENT OF
HEADQUARTERS, BATT.A.LION OF ENGINEERS,

Willett's Point, N. Y. R., February 9, 1871. Sm: I hav-e the honor to submit the following report upon the duties which you assigned tv me during the recent solar eclipse in Sicily: My instruments consisted of a comet-seeker, having a large fielu of Yiew, (magnifying power about 8,) and a gootl Casella aneroid barometer, designed to be carried on tile person like a watcil. My station was the highest attainable point on l\Iount Etna. l\Iy duties were to study the physical characteristics of the corona. In company of Professor Sihиestri, of the University of Catania, anll a party of five English astronomers, I proceeded on Decemuer 21 to the C~tsa I1'erentina, a small hut on tile side of Mount Etna, elevated about 4,950 feet al.Jove tlie sea. Here we spent a stormy night. At daylight on the 22d snow was still falling heavily, but about 8 a. m. the weather cleared. Leaиdng the rest of the party at the casa, I proceeded up the mountain with a guicle. The soft suow, var_yiug in depth from 6 inches to 2 feet, made the route impassable for mules, and a gale of wind, loaded with particles of sleet, which blew strongly in our faces, rendered the ascent exhaust. ing. By noon an elevation of 8,736 feet above the sea had been reached, at a point near the summit of Montagnuola. The smoke blowiug from the crater made a further ascent inexpedient. A station was accmdingly selected, as well sheltered from wind as possible, and every preparation was made for observing. The clouds, in cmnulose masses, were all_far below us, and first contact occurred under favorable circumstances, which gave every promise of continuance. Suddenly, however, the mountain was enveloped in a cloud which soon produced a storm of bail that rattled among the ice and lava with a sound like the breaking of glass. The gradual loss of light began to give an inky tinge to the deep gray of the storm; totality was rapidly approaching, and, there being no prospect of a favorable change, at fifteen minutes before the instant, I started down the mountain with all possiule speed, vainly hoping to escape from the cloud. At an elevation of 71500 feet I was ov-ertaken by the shadow, which swept with great rapidity ov-er us, darkening the gloom to an aweinspiring degree. The amount of light was sufficient to render ort1inary type visible, but the peculiar ghastly effect was lilrn nothing usual in nature. After continuing about a minute, this gave place suddenly to a rosy red tint, which lasted fully a minute and then gradually changed to the former inky gray. In a moment or two more I had a glimpse of the sun's crescent, resembling that of the earliest new moon. This peculiar action of clouds in absorbing least the red rays of the feebly-returning ligllt is, I regret to say, the only result of my obsenations. Possibly it may serve to explain the color sometimes obserYed in the corona when viewed through a hazy atmosphere. I append the following barometrical observations to illustrate the surprising accuracy of the little instrument, whicll was no larger than an ordinary watch. It was corrected for temperatnre by the maker; but, being carried in the pocket, was not subjected to much change in this respect. It was read carefully by microscope. Some of the air-temperatures are ouly approximate. The altitude of the station in Catania has been assumed at 50 feet.

REPORT OF OBSElffATIONS or TIIE TOTAL SOI"AR ECLIPSE 01-' DECDWER 2:!, lSiO. }!.\DE AT CARLENTINI, SICILY, BY .LDIER C. WATROX, PH. D., DTHECTOR OF THE OBSERLlTOiiY AT ANN AHBOR, :MICHIGAX.

"\xx Annor., JJlarch, 1S71. DEAI~ Sm: Having; recei\иed an invitation from you to join your party in Sicily to obsenиe the solar eclipse of December 2:3, 1870, I lrnTe the honor to tramnnit to yon the following report of my observations: I left Ann Arbor the latter part of October and proceeded \'ia Engla11<l <HHl the continent, reaching Catania on the 17th of December. After consultation with you and with Dr. Peters, I finally, with your appron<l, seleetell the villag-e of Carloutini, twent.\--one milc~s south of Catauia, and very near the central line of the eclipse, as my observing-station; but on account of the reputed unhealthiness of this village to a person not acclimated, I did not g;o tlH:re until the day of the eclipse. My telescope and stand had heen shipped from Lhиerpool direct to Sicily, so that I found them in Cata.nia upon my arrintl there, and hadng decided upon observing simply the phenomena 1nиesented by C(irl cnti ni. the corona, it was not ne.cessary for me to convey other instruments to Carlentini. Accompanied by your courier as _a general assistant, I left Catania early on tlrn moruing of December 2~ by special conYeyauce, and reached Carlentini at 11 o'clock. I had been proyided with a letter of introduction to MU. Alfio and_ Luigi )fodica, prominent citi:r.ens of thc~placc, and I found upon my arrival that they ha(l~already been advised of my intended visit and of its oJ.:\ject,, and that they hail Hou Be. already selected various positions which _seemed t.o them convenient as"statious for obsen-ation. Ila Ying examined the locafrties sngge;ted by them, I tinally decided to obser>e from a point just outside the south ~Statio11. wall of the town, where I wouldi from the nature of the ground, be prote1~tcd from the \l'inil, which was blowing quite briskly. There was no opportunit~- during my stay in Carlentini to determine the geographical position of my station; ltnt it may be easily determined from the data of the trigonometrical snrYey of the i8land in the possession of the I tali an gonrnmen t. Tlle station was 200 feet south of the south wall known a.s the wall of Charles 1 V of Spain, antl 100 feet east of its southwest corner, as shown by the above diagram.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

l\Ir. Modica informed me that the house near which I obserYetl is 400 yards due south from the pillar erected near the north entrance to the town for the trigonometrical sur.-ey. It is quite probable that the position of the southwest corner of the wall is recorded in the results of the surYey. The town is situated on a hill about 500 feet in height, it being the ridge separating the valley of Catania from that of Agosta and S~Tacuse. The telescope which I used was an f\Xcellent one, conslructed by Alnm Clark & Sons, and belonging to the high school at Grand Rapids, Michigan. Hs aperture is 3U- inches, and tests under a great variety of circumstances ha Ye convinced me that its optical performance cannot be excelled by any instrument of its size. M,y experience in the case of tl1e total eclipse of the strn in 1869 admonished me that the interval of totality would quickly pass; much more so than one acthиely engaged in obserиing wonkl suspect, and that if I attempted too much I slwulu fail in all. I therefore determined to observe with a power of about 40, which gave me a sufficiently extemled field aud the most perfect definition. Although I bad determined t-o observe clliefly the phenomena of the corona at tlle time of tob11ity, yet there was of course opportunity, without iuterf'eriug with m;i- plan, to obser,иe the first and last contacts, and to make ousernttions of' the cusps and of other phenomena as the eclipse progressed. "\\'hen I left Catania, in the morning, it was raining, and the }ffOspect for clear weather was anything but favorable. About !J o'clock the clouds broke up, and shortly afterward the sky was quite clear iu all directions, except in the immediate neighborhood of Mount Etna, around which the low clouds seemed to hover. From my station, at 12 o'clock, the prospect for clear weather during the remainder of the day was good. The first contact was observed at1811 4ni 13'.0 chronometer time. The moon's limb bisected the umbra of the first two spots at18~

27m 17'.0.

Aud it uisecteu the nm bra of the second spot. at18" 33m 13'.0. It also bisected the nuelens of a smaller spot, near the sun's center, at181'

asru 2i".0.

During the progress of the eclipse I watched the cnsps attentively, and theJи remained constantly sharp at the extremities, there being no blunting whatever. The atmosphere was remarkably steady and the definition excellent. At about 18h 50m, chronometer time, a bank of clouds appeared in the west rising rapidly, and in a few minutes the sky was entirely overcast. I sent the courier to the t-0p of the wall to report as to the prospects around us, and he reported dense clouds in all dfrectious, with a. rain storm in the neighborhood of Catania.. The high expectations created by the favorable beginning, gave place to an indescribable anxiety at the prospect now before me. It seemed the very greatest misfortune that my long journey was to be without any scientific reward. It gave rue some consolat.ion, however, to know that my distress was sympathetically shared by the gentlemen present, and it is but just to say that the entlmsiasm at the dcnouenient was as strikingly manifested. While all appeared thus hopeless, suddenly a ray of promise gleamed through a small break in the great cloud wl1ich covered the sun; by degrees this became wider and wider, until at last, just four minutes before totality was to begin, the cloud parted, one part passing to the northward in the valle,y south of Etna, and the other passing to the soutl1, so that during the whole of totality, and afterwards, 'Yith only a single interruption, until near the time of the last contact, I bad the good fortune to observe in the clearest aml purest sky imaginable. The moments for observing the corona 1luring the totality being so precious, I did not venture to obsenиc the time of the second contact; but Mr. Modica observed it with a small refraetor, power about 50, at ]9h 2im 10".0 chronometer time. The thirrl contract was not obserYed, since the gentlemen present were so struck by the grandeur of the scene that they remained, as it were, spellи bound until the light had again burst forth. I had requested MM. Modica, whom I found to bean accomplished gentlemen, and well versed in solar physics, to make sketches of the corona for me, and I had prepared sheets for them, with refer-

ence-points markerl on them; but when tlw totality had passed, iu answer to my question as fo what they had recorded, they showerl rue tbe sbeets without any atlrlitional trncc, anrl with a shrng of tbe shoulders and a gesticulation of "lnblimity, they sai~l it had passed so soon that they could not " think to make one mark.:' Before proceeding to state particularly the rt>sults of my olrnen-atious duriug tlie totality, 1 will complete in this connection the statement of the results as to the tinws of the contacts. I observed the last contact through a bank of thin clouds, at .'.!011 47m 41' chronomete1и time. The times "░ere noted by a pocket-chronometer made hy the National \Vatch Company of Elgin, Illinois. It bad maintained its rate well during the long jounH'Y from .Aun Arhor to Catania, and hence it was relied upon for these observations. It was compared with the standard chronometers at the obsening station of J\Ir. Scllott, in the Benedictine Gar1len at Catania, on tlw days preceding and following that of the eclipse. The comparison" gave the following results: 1870, December 21, 21 11 42n1 chroncmeter time. Horuby 1107, chronometer (]It 32m 18."0. 21 50 chronometer tirnP.

The difference of longitude between my station and the American station in the Benedicti11e at Catania, may lie obtained from the data given by the trigonometrical sunиey of the island of Sicily, and then these times may be reduced to Carlentini mr,an time. As already stated, a few minutes before the totality began the cloud broke awl gare us perfectly clear sky in the neighborhoou of the sun. .Just before the sccoml contact I noticed the formation of Baily's beads,_ but only such appearances as would result from the irregularities of the moon's limb. I also noticed one bright prominence near the south point of the limb about fift.een seconds before the total obscuration. The corona was also visible at the same time. As soon as the last mys of tbe photosphere disappeared, I immediately sketched, with the naked eye, the outline of the bright corona, and having comиpleted its trace I comparecl the sketch with the sun in order' to be assured of its accuracy. Then, without loss of time, I placed my CJ"e at the t.ele.scope already adjusted for sharp definition. In the first place I moved the telescope around
G~rden

the limb of tbe moon to see whether the outline and extent of the corona agreecl with the sketch already made, and having assured myself of this fact, I then sketched the places of the principal prominences as reference points for the positions of remarkable indentations in the corona which were conspicuous in passing round it. Hai:ing sketched the places aml the form of these indentations, I then stndit'd carefully, for a few moments, its structure, and sought to notice particularly whether any changes whatever took place. As soon as I saw that the totality was about to entl, I again traced the outline of the corona as visible to the naked e;ye, and the total phase, lasting one hundred and ten seconds, had })assed. Fully sensible of the impossibility of sketching more than outlines during the short })eriod of totality, I did not attempt more, and I was thus enabled to de-vote attention to uetails of structure ancl to other phenomena which would otherwise have passed unnoticed. The sketches were made in rny note-book with pencil; hut as soon as the totality had passed, I sat down and wrote out full explanations of the meaning of the marks made; as well as full descriptio11s of the phenomena which I obser,Ted. Upon returning to Catania, I spent the greater portion of the next three days in making, from these sketches-while everything connected with the appearance of the corona was vivid in my mind, and before I could be influenced in my judgment by an;r reports of what was seen by others-two crayon drawings, which I send yon witli this report, the first sllowing the corona as it appeared to the naked eye, the other showing it as it appeared in the telescope. But, before proceeding further -with statements in regard to these drawings, I will mention particularly some of the phenomena ''hich I observed. As seen by the naked eye there was a bright band of light, about one-third the solar ratlius in extent, completely surrounding foe sun. The outline of its exterior portion was well defined, lmt irregular; and near tlie lower Jim b, aml to tlie rigut, was a conspicuous indentation, while on tlic eastern limb, where the width of the corona was on ti.Jc average a maximum, there were fainter indentations. Immediately outside uf this bright corona was a second or fainter one extending out until it faded away at perhaps a distance from the moon's limb equal to the sun;s radius, although I recorded it as being distinctly seen at a tfo;tance of onlj' t"-иo-thinls of the Rolar radius. }'rom the beginning to the end of the total phase the bright solar corona, so far as I conlu see, was absolutely constant both in form and in brilliauc~", but I noticed that tlie exterior or faint corona was first brighter and more extem;ive 011 the eastern limb at the beginning of totality, and then rierceptibly brighter on the western sitle as the total eclipse en<led. This change of brilliancy of the exterior faint corona led me to t!Jink at the time that this portion of tlie corona is non-solar, and that it was due to the illumination of our atmosphere by the bright light of the iu11er or solar corona, and I see no reason ;yet to change the opinion thus formed, although possibly it might have been due in part to particles of matter in the neigh borlioocl of' the sun, but not connected with it directly. As seen in the telescope the phenomena presentell to tlie naked ej'C were more distinct. The extent and the outline of the inner bright corona were the same. bnt the faint indentations which were -visible to the uakeJ. eye here appeareu to extend down to' the limb of the moon, giving the appearance of a cusp <1uite dee1>lj- shatletl at the point am1 gra1l11ally becoming bdghter aml brighter, until at the limit of the corona it was somewhat brighter than the external halo. This external halo seemeu thus to eun~lope the inner corona like a veil. The positions of these cusps were carefully noted by refcrenc.e to neighboriug 1>romincnces. They were bounded by regular curved outlines with opposing convexities. The points were sharp, and I noticed particularly that the moon in passiug along occnltetl tl1em precisely as it did the prominences. There w.ere three of these cusps on the eastern limbs anu one on tbe lower limb, and a little to the right, as seen by direct vision. The positions of tiles(и c1rn1is me;isurml from the vertex of the sun toward the east were a1)proxinmtely as follows : First cusp. - .... ~. . .... _....... _..... __ ........... _... _.... _и_ ..... __ . . . . . 2Go Second cusp ......... -........... - -...............и............ _. . . . и . . . . . 930 T.hird cusp .......... - ............. __ . _. _.и............ _.............. ___ . 1420 Iи'ourtb cusp .. _......................... . .......и... _.. _............. _____ 2200 These angles, it must be understood, are not the results of exact measurements, but simply the mean of the results obtained by estimation from two independe.nt sketches of their relative

positions. Their position in reference t-0 neighboring prominences are correctly shown on ti.JP drawings, and when the exact places of these prominences shall h~we been determined, we ma.r thus derive more exact Yalues. Tlle first three of these cusps were more distinct as seen in tl1e telescope than the fourth, but not quite so large. An examination of the coronal parts between these apparent indentations, which I have called cusps, showed that for a distance of perhaps one minute from the Jimb it was of intense uniform brilliancy, then passing outward were stream;; of luminous matter, extending to near the outer extremity of the corona, where they were again blended together into a bright mиen baud which marked the limit of what, appeared to be the rPal solar corona. These radiating streams were separated by more faintly joJ.luminated interstices, arnl thus gave indications at some points of an apparent radial structure of tlrn corona. In tl1e vicinity of the cusps these lines were currnd conformably to the cusp, the curvature becoming less and less receding from the cusp, until, at a point midway between two cusps, the lines or streams were radial. This structural form was most distinct on the eastern limb, and in the immedinte vicinity of the cusps. The fine definition of tlle telescope was shown dmi11g these obsenиations b,\и a view of Saturn which l obtained in sweeping round the contour of the corona. I thought at first tllat I could see an apparent connection betTI"een the distribution or the prominences and the didsious in the coroua, but the brief period of observation ditl not permit me to determine anything definitely on that point. I <lid not venture to attempt to sketcll more than the principal prominences as sure points of reference, and I think it quite possible that when the piaees of all the prominences then visible arc known, some oonncction of this kind will be e.-ident. lt was apparent to me that the extent of the corona was directly conuected with tlle promiue11ces, and after my drawing, shmriugits outline, was completed, I was informed b~и 1\fr. Seabrooke, of the English partJ-, that he had mapped all tlJe prominences on the day of the eclipse and not long before its cornmeucement by mealls of the spectroscope. 'Ve subsequentl.r compared bis map ~Yith my drawing, and the intimate relation which I bad suspected was completely showu. \\'here, by his map, there were high prominences, there was shown in my drawing a corresponding extension of the corona, and whrrc t!Jere were no prominences my drawing showed the corolla at its minimum. The drawings, which I send yon herewith, were made wilb crayons, from the outlines traeed alld descriptions recorded at tl1e time of the eelipse as alreacly stated. For facilities in tbis work I am indebtt:'d to l\fr. Darwiu, of' the J,_;uglish party, who had intended to sketch the corona from the cone of l\lount Etua, but lrn,иing been so unfortunate, after ascendiug nearly G,000 feet, as to be in a terrific snow-storm during tlle whole of the eclipse, be was not permitted to realize Lis plan, and hence he yery kindly turned oYer to me the paper and the crayons. Ila,'ing been tlrns proYided with means of completing the delineations which I had sketched, I determined to make the drawi11g1-1 before I left Catania, while eYCrJthiugconnected with the observations was viddl,y impressed upon my mind, although I had taken the precaution to write out full descriptions of the phenomena observed and ex11Ja11ations of the marks which I traced in my pencil sketches in my note-book. to be available for the completion of the drawings at any subsequent time. Kot being skilled iu crayon drawings I found great difficulty in attempting to delineate what I saw. I scn<l you the drawing" as I made them at Catania, fearing that if I attempt t-0 improve them I may interfere in some way with the evidence which they afford. I will therefore endeavor to state wherein they clo 11ot convey precisely the idea which I wish to communicate. ~First, then, in respect to the drawing representing the corona as seen by the naked eye. 'l'lie outline of the solar corona is perhaps too marked in contrast with the light of the secondary corona, if viewed in close proximity and with a strong light. It conveys best the correct impression if .ron place it in a moderate- light admitted from the side, and view it at a distaucc of about J .> or :w feet, so that the contrast between the outer and the inner or solar corona is not too Yi,иid. The color of the moo!l is too dark; it should be of a deep neutral tillt. The corona also should indicate a pearl-white vivid light nearest the limb of the sun, and fainter somewhat at its extremity. There were no prominences visible distinctly to the naked eye as in the case of the total eclipse in 1809. but the effect was apparently to intensify the light of the corona in the places where the telescope revealed them. The second drawing gives the telescopic view of the corona. The positions and the form of

134

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

the cusps arc correctly indicated. '.l'he streams of light already mentioned are also shown, but I did not succeed, with the crayons which I had at hand, in gi\иing pre-0isely the correct delineation. The form of these streams and their relation to the cusps are indeed clearly indicated, but there was a general effect which, having failed to imticate sufficiently in the drawing, I will attempt to describe. The appearance in tbe telescope reminded me of tbe great comet of 1858, which I observed attentively. There was in the corona first a uniform band of light, pearl-white, as in the case of the bright cornets, then streams of luminous matter flowing out, and afterward spreading and uniting, thus forming a shellи1ike oovelope to the sun. It seemed as if the cusps were merely rents in this envelope, and as if I were lookil.)g into a partially transparent shell, within which was a brilliant core emitting luminous streams. The manner in which the exterior halo enveloped the solar corona is not exactly shown in my drawing. The cusps were dark at tl1e apex, and quite bright at the extremity of the corona, but not nearly so bright as the other portions of the corona, so that, being of a brilliancy not much in excess of that of the outer halo, the appearance wal'! that of the forи matiou by the latter of a sort of' envelope passing down into the indentations of the former. The color of the moon should be of a deep neutral tint, and the prominences should be of' a light rosy tint. They were not so red as in 1869, but exhibited a more glowing intensity of light. In ,conclusion, permit me to say, that, being fully convinced from these observations that the IJright corona whose limit was well defined is really an appendage of the sun, composed of glowing gas, I concluded to observe carefully whether it might not be visible during the partial eclipse, and I was able to see it distinctly, by the visibility of the limb of the moon beyond the limb of the sun. At 20h 38m chronometer time, or only ten minutes before the last contact, I could distinctly trace tbe limb of the moon to a distance of two minutes of arc from the sun's limb. Hence I venture the pre<liction that a careful scrutiny will show the corona during any partial eclipse, and I couc<'ive it to be Yery possible indeed that the Janssen-Lockyer method may be extended so that the corona may be studied at all times, as well as the prominences. If I am not miRtaken as to the indications of what I saw autl what I have here recorded, the attempt ought to be made. Thanking you >cry sincerely for your kind in>itation to take part in the expedition, I suhmit, through you to the~world this statement of the results of my ob:servations, with the hope that they may be regarded a:-; having some value in perfecting our knowledge of the physical constitution of the snn.

REPORT OF OTI.'iERY ATIONS OF THE TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE OF DECEMBER 22, 1870, MADE AT JEREZ DE LA FRONTERA, BY JOSEPH WINLOCK.

Sm: In the autumn of 1870, I undertook at your request the organization and direction of a party to be employed in observing the total solar eclipse of December 22, in the same year. The place which I selected for the observations was Jerez de la Frontera, in the south of Spain, near Cadiz. The advantages of this station known to meи at the time were that it lay near the central line of the eclipse, and wa,s connected by railroad with Cadiz. The climate of the whole of Southern Spnin was known to be on the whole favorable to observations, but I could gather no definite information as to the climate of Jerez itself as compared with other Spanish stations. I was gratified to learn, on my arriYal there, however, that the chance of clear weather in the southwest of Spain is at least equal, and probably superior, to that at stations farther east. In confirmation of this view, I subjoin a statement compiled from a meteorological record kept; between Augt1st 15, 1864, and September 30, 1870, at the house of Mr. Richard Davies, in Jerez. A thermometer at a distance from any building would no doubt show a larger range of temperature than is apparent from this record. The thermometer was observed at 8 a. m., 12 m., 3 p. m., 8 p. m.

IrnPORT OF THE SlJPERINTENDENT OF

The party under my direction consisted of the following gentlemen: Mr. G, \V. Dean, assistant United 8tates Coast Survey; Professor C. A. Young, of Dartmouth College; Captain 0. II. Ernst, t:uited States Army; Professor S. P. Langley, Western University, Allegheny, Pennsylvania; Professor E. C. Pickering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Mr. AlYan G. Clark, of Cambridge. port, l\Iassa<ibusetts; 3Ir. Ilenry Gannett, assistant at Harvard College ObscrYatory; Mr. 0. II. Willard, of Philadelphia, photographer to the expedition, and his assistant, Mr. }fahony; Mr. Ross, assistant to Professor l'ickering; Mr. J. White, of CamLridgc, i\fassachnsetts, caqlenter to the e'xpet1itim1. Tliree gentlemen whom I met in Spain, as will hereafter Le stated, >Ir. Gordon, Mr. Norman, aml l\Ir. Pye, also assisted me in the observations of the eclipse. The instruments furnished for the expedition uy Harvard College OLscrYatory were as follows: 1. Equatorial telescope from west dome, aperture Gl inches. !?. Equatorial, ordinarily used as the finder for the large te]('scopc or the ouservatory; objectglass by l\lel'z, nperture 4 inches. 3. Equatorial, aperture 3 inches, mounted on 1.Jrass stand of Bowditch comet-seeker. иL Comet-seeker, with reflecting prism, and e:ye-piece at enu of axis; aperture 4 inches. 5. Small telescope, bought of G. l\L Searle, with equatorial mounting; aperture 3 inches. G. J,erebonr's telescope, on stand; aperture 3 inches. 7. Quincy comet-Hecker; aperture 22- inches. S. Telescope of 6 inches aperture, mounted eqnatorially, witlJ dock-иIYork from west dome, for taking photographs; lens corrected for the chemical rays. !I. Stationar,y telescope for instantaneous photographs, with plane mirror to throw the sunlight npon the lens; aperture 4 inches, focal length 32~ feet. 10. Spectrnscope hy Tronghton & Simms, with two pl'isms of tlint-glass. 11. Spectroscope hy .A.lvan Clal'k & Sons, with one fl.int-glass prism. I:!. A telescope of 8 inches aperture, with equatorial mounting and clock-work, borrowed from :\Iessrs. Al Yan Clark & Sons, for use ju photography. Also Yarious smaller instruments and apparatus belonging to Hananl College Observatory, among which may Le mentioned a transit theodolite by L. Casella, No. 312!); a chronometer with galrnuic recording attachment, by C. Frodsham, No. 34i:il; cameras for the photographic telescopes. The United States Uoast Survey furnished transit instrument No. 5 aml chronograph No. 2; also a chronometer with galvanic recording attachment. Dartmouth College sent an equatorial telescope, four spectroscopes, a comet-seeker, and other instruments, which will be found described in the report of l'rofessor Young. Professor Langley brought a small portaule telescope, a Savart's polariscope, anu a polarizing solar eye-piece. Professor Pickering also brought apparatus for ohser>ing 1101arizatiou. Captain Ernst brought a sextant and several small telescopes; and Mr. \Villanl was provided with photographic materials. I left .Xew York by the Cunard steamer of No...-cmber 3, aud procecdcu, by the steamer leaving Soflthampton .Xovember rn, to Gibraltar, where I arrivetl November 26; and thence, three days later, went to Cadiz. The instruments, which were left at Liverpool in charge of Mr. A.G. Clark and JUr. ""hite, arrirnd soon after, ancl were, without much delay, passed through the customhouse, the officials at Cadiz, to whom I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks, being disposed to aecommodate the expedition as much as possible. I have also to acknowledge my obliga. tions to General Duffie, our consul at Cadiz, for his courtesy and assistance. Through the kindness of our vice-consul at Cadiz, Mr. Younger, I was made acquainted with Mr. Uicbard H. Davies and his brother, wi11e-merchants, of Jerez. The kind attentions of these gentlemen malle the selection of a place for the observations and the mounting of the instruments ~L comparatively easy task. Mr. Davies at once placed at; our service his own country-seat, 1' Olivar de Buena Vista," which I directly perceived to be admirably suited to the wants of the expedition, from it.s buildings, its convenient distance from the city, and its proximity to the telegraph line which I expected to use in determining the difference of longitude between our station and the obserYatory of San FerIMmdo. I also obtained from Senor Riviero, through the intervention of l\lr. Gordon, leave to occupy bis estate, ca1led "Recreo,'' which is situated aLout three-eighths of

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

137

a mile north-north we flt from the station at " Olivar." The roof at this place furnished a fine po8ition for the small instruments and for observat,ions of polarization and of general phenomena, while the heavier instruments which required to be placed upon the ground, an(l needed no extended view of the lrnaYens, found ample accommodations at "Olivar." 1 considered the expediency of dfriding the party and sending some of tlll\lll to MarlJella, or Eslcpona, or into the mountains in the neighborhood of Jerez; but I became satisfied that no adYantage could be expected from thi8. Those Lest informed upon the subject assured me that the only wind that could bring harm to us would be equally disastrous to stations on the Mediterranean; and my 01n1 observations at Gibraltar and elsewhere, of the manner in wh]ch clouds collected about the Spanish rnouutains, comиinced me that it would be better to avoid the high land. I therefore couclnJ.ed to keep the party together at Jerez, and the result seems to ha\c justified this decision. 11,cached Jerez 011 December G, and by December!) all my part;\и were upon the ground. Ju spite of the difficulty of procuring lumber, referred to in the report of ~Ir. Dean, all the preparations for the obsen-atiou of the eclipse were completed in due season, aud each obsenиer's work had bee11 assigned to him. .Lis the report,; of other members of the party coutaiu full tletails of the work undertaken by them, l ha\e bnt little to add before gidng au accouut; of the photographic work and of my ow11 ubservatious. A telescope and spectroscope, Xu::;,'..! aud 11 iu foe list of instrumeuts, lm<l. becu intended for the use of Mr. U. S. Peirce, in Sicily, but by an accidental misunderstanding were brought to Jerez with the other instruments. Underthesecircumstauces, I at first intended to assign this telescope and spectroscope to Professor Langley, but as he preferred to observe with the polariscope, the spectroscope was detached and assigned to Mr. Pye, who used it with a :>mall ltand-telescope, placed in front of the slit, aa.d corroborated P1иufessor Young's very important observation of the "spectrum filled for an instant with brigllt lines.'' J\Ir. Pye, Mr. J.C. Gordon, and l\Ir . .Norman, who have been mentioned above, were English gentlemen of scientific tastes, who kindly offered me their assistance in Spain, and formed a valuable addition to our corps of observers, 1\Ir. Gordon and 1\Ir. Norman being most accomplished draughtsmen. )'fr. Gordon used his own telescope of about 3 inches aperture, mounted on a tripod stand, and made the sketch, plate 4; his report will be found below. l\Cr. Norman, uulnckil;v, had an instrument which rendered bis skill in sketching of little arnil. The stationary telescope, No. t) in the list of instruments abon\ was used by ::\Ir. Gannett i11 pllotographing the full di::;k of the sun, and the partial phases of the eclipse; two of these photographs are represented in plate 1. It was part of my plan to take simultaneous pictures of partial phases with the three photographic telescopes, and by means of micrometric measurements of ihe negatives to test the rclatize and absolute accuracy of the work done by each telescope. Ent the unfavorable weather of the day of the eclipse prevented the satisfactory execution of this pr~jeet. Telescopes :Nos. 8 and 12 in tlie above list were used in photographing the total phase-the first by llfr. иwmard, and the seconcl by :Mr. Mahony. As in 1869, the photographs were taken in the principal foci of the object-glasses of both instruments. Guided by my experi1>nce in observing the eclipse of 1869, at Shelbyville, I had arranged the cameras for these telescopes in such a way that at the instant of totality the slides which were used for making instantaneous exposures of the 1ilates for partial phases might be drawn out and thrown aside, so that there migl:t be no danger of cutting off any part of the corona. This apparatus, although rough in appearance, answered its purpose admirably in 1869. But on this occasion I was induced to allow anot.her to be substituted for it, shortly before the eclipse. The new contrivance seemed very ingenious and nuol~ectionable, and not having sufficient time to consider it attenti:vely, I supposed that it would answer as well as the old one. Unfortunately the slide of this apparatus could not be removed, and the opening in it was small, so that, in the best of the two photographs taken, part of the outer corona was lost, although the whole of the inner corona seems to have been secured. Its outline is distinctly seen, surrounded by the fainter light which alone was limited by the diaphragm. The triggers which released the slide in ,the apparatus which was used required a light for tl1eir successful management, and tbe accidental blowing out of this light caused some confusion in the photographic work, which may have resulted in additional defects in tbe pictures obtained.

REPORT O.F THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The picture of the corona, plate 12, taken at Shelbyville in 1869, represented, in my opinion, all the bright part of the corona, and its true form. From the rapidity with which the intensity of the light diminishes toward the borders, what lies outside of this must be very faint. The extent of the visible corona has been variously estimated by different observers, in all eclipses of the sun. It seems to depend in no unimportant degree on the clearness of the atmosphere. This is especially noticeable in the accounts of the eclipse of 1851, given in Vol. XXI of the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society. In these accounts the estimate of the breadth of the corona is less when the sky is represented as clear ; so that in some instances it is estimated but little larger than it appears in photographs. l\Iy plan was to take three photographs of the corona with the G-iuch and one ouly with the 8-inch telescope; that is, to leave the plate exposeo in the latter duringи nearly the whole of the total phase, hoping that this large apertme and long exposure would secure tlte outer faint light, while the bright parts of the corona would be distinctly represented in the photographs made with the smaller instrument. Everything was in readiness fur carrying out this plan, but the discouraging aspect of the weather on the day of the eclipse, which is sufficiently descrilJed iu the reports of my colleagues, made it hopeless to attempt so much. Accordingly, instead of giving directions for a certain number of exposures of specific duration, I simply directed the photographers to watch their opportunit.v, and to use their own judgment as to the time of exposure, guided by the intensity of the light, modified, as it most likely would be, by the clouds. Oue good picture was, if possible, to be obtained with each telescope. The photographs actually takeu during totality are represented by the engravings, plates 13 and 2, the first being taken by Mr. 'Villard aud the second by Mr. Mahony. Several positives on glass were taken by Mr. Willard immediately aft.er the eclipse, some of which were left in England, and haYe probably served as the originals of the prints that have appeared in seYeral publications on this subject. These positives were taken from the first photograph, plate 13; the second was regarded by Mr. wиmard as a failure, and I did not know of its existence until after my return home. I do not know how to accouut for its appearance. Mr. "\Villard attributes it to the shaking of the telescope by the wind. Inasmuch as the outer edge of the light fell clcarl.v inside of the mark of the diaphragm in the plate, I thought it worth while to have an engraYing made from this photograph, if only to show how far from the image of the moon the plate had been affected by light from the corona, the aperture haYing been 8 inches and the time of exposure~ as nearly as 1 can ascertain, one minute and a half. It is not easy to represent correctly in engravings the appearance of the original negatives. It bas been found impossible to print the outer faint lights directly from the negati\Te, in whiel1, however, they can plainly be seen. 'fhe method adopted in the case of plate 2, from the photograph made with the 8-inch telescope, has been to make a drawing from the projection of the negatiYe upon a screen by means of a powerful calcium light. The drawing is intended correctl,y to exhibit the extent and form of the different masses of light which it depicts, but not their relati Ye brightness. None of the photographs of the total phase taken under my direction, either in 1869 or in 1870, can be fully represented by photographic printing. In plate 13 there is seen au inner uorona, resembling in form arid dimensions the corona of plate J2, from the ShelbyYille photograph .. In the positives on glass no trace of this is seeu when the picture is held between the eye and the light, but it becomes Yery distinct when the picture is placed on a dark surface and examined by reflected light. The same thing is apparent in a less degree in the photograph of 1869. In this case the prominences, which are very distinct in the negatiYe and correctly repreи sented ID the engraving, are not shown at all in photographic prints. The same is true of the internal structure of the corona. In the original negative this has a fibrous or woolly appearance, which is loRt in copying by photography, and is not shown in plate 12, which is a copy on steel of a photograph, with the prominences added by a tint-stone. The position angles on the margin of these engravings are counted from the north pole of the sun through the east. They were obtained in the following manner: The camera remained undisturbed from the b ..ginning to the end of the eclipse; the edges of the glass plates were straight and parallel. Hence, by placing the plate containing the total phase between two plates showing partial phases before and after totality, I was enabled to determine the position from the line of <иnsps with all the accuracy attaimtble in a diagram of the proportions of these plates.

Jn the spring of 1870 I received from Father A. Secchi au engraved copy of a phot-0graph of the eclipse of 18UO, taken by him in Spain; and one of the first points in it which attracted my attention was tlte remarkable resemblance between the form of the corona therein depicted and that shown in the photograph taken in 1869. The photograph of 1870 was subsequently found to resemble each of the others. This resemblance extends to the principal depressions in the corona as well as to its general arrangement aboutи. the 1mn's axis. I communicated these facts at the time to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and illustrated them by the drawing, plate 3, in which the three pictures are reduced to the same scalr> and placed in the same position, with the uorth pole uppermost. Besides the general work incitlent to tlte organization and equipment of the expedition, an<l tlie care of securing tlte conditions which offered the best chance of' success in all the observations undertaken, Iliad laid out for myself the special occupation of cnilearnring to ascertain the nature of that fainter portion of the corona wliich lies outside the limits of the best photographs, and concerning which there luwe been such conflicting accounts and opinions. I had no doubt that the brighter parts of the corona \\""Oul<l rccei,-e from other observers more than their due share of attention; and I felt confillcnt tliat sooner or later the principal facts relating to their constitution would be settled witliout tlie aid of total eclipses. I undertook simply to get answeTS to these two questions: What bright lines are visible in the spectrum of this fainter light, and whether or not any dark lines are to be seen in it. My preи vious experience in Kentucky had made me aware of the serious loss of time, as well as of the confusion and liability to error, i11st>p:uable from a11y method of fixing the positions of lines in the spectrum during totality b.r means of a scale to be read and recorded at the time of observation. It seemed to me very important that there s110uld be some means of making a permanent record of the place of a line at the instant when it was seen, without loss of time or distraction of attention. This l'Ccord could then be measured and studied at leisure. These considerations led me to an invention which I thought well adapted to its purpose, and likely to be useful in spectrosco1les of any construction. It consists in rigidly attaching a point or cutting tool to that part of the spectroscope which is mo\иed to effect a pointing on a given line of the spectrum, in such a way that it may be pressed upon a plate suitable to receive the record when the telescope is directed to the spectrum line to be recorded. Any number of lines from a given spectrum may thus be registered, and by sliding the plate on wltieh the record is made in a direction normal to that of tlrn motion given, by changing the pointing of the spectroscope to the recording tool any number of spectra may be registered side by side for ready comparison. The first and tile simplest method that would occur to any one would be to use a point to prick a hole in some soft. substance. But heing afraid that the dots so produced might be confounded with small spots or accidental indentaи tions on the plate, and that this would lead to confusion and uncertainty in identif.ying the record, I thought it safer to give the point a sliding motion after it touched the plate, so as t-0 make a mark similar to those on the limbs of graduated instruments, about which there could be no mistake. The manner in which this was done is illustrated in plate 19 and plate 11 1 Fig. 3. The instrument shown in plate 19 was completed and exhibited to the American Academy in October, 1870. In Professor Young's spectroscope, I attached the recording tool to the prisms. In all these instruments, I dispensed with clamps and used double-threaded tangent screws to give rapid motiou in pointing without danger of slipping when the record should be made, I also applied to the spectroscopes small reflectors by which the observer could see the image of the sun on the slit without removing his eye from the telescope. ~f.v method of using this mechanical recording apparatus was first to register some standard lines of the solar spectrum or of the spectrum of some well-known substance; then to slide the plate and to register the lines to be determined by the side of the first series. The plate is then to be put under a microscope and the places of the lines determined with a micrometer. For general i;Lse in spectroscopes I proposed to rule a scale of standard Hues of the solar spectrum, and to interpolate from this any desired scale, one of wave lengths, for instance, or that of Kirnhlrntf. This scale should then be permanently attached to the spectroscope in such a way that the place of au observe.d line in the adopted scale may be read off at a glance.

l~EPORT

OF THE SUPERINTENDENT 01''

The telescope which I used at Jerez was an equatorial of 5:\; inches aperture, and about 7 feet focal length, made by Alvan Clark; it was mounted without clock-work, and had attache<l to it, as a finder, a very excellent teleBcope of inches aperture, and a power of about 40, known as the Quincy comet-seeker. These instruments are Nos. 1 and 7 of the list given ahovr, and the spectroscope used was No. 10 of the same list. The cross-wires of the finder were carefully adjusted the evening before the eclipse, so that when the finder was pointed on a star its spectrum would appear in the spectroscope. I adjusted the width of the slit by faint clouds or patches of blue sky, so that if dark lines were present they could not escape me, and a faint continuous spectrum might not be cut off. Mr. Alvan G. Clark, whose skill in everythiug pertainiug to a telescope insured careful mH1 judicious management of the instrument, was stationed at the finder to direct the telescope to the parts of the corona which were to be examined, and at the same 1,ime to observe incident.ally gl'-neral plienomena. 1\Ir. Clal'!o:: took llis place at the finder just before the beginning of the total phase. On the instant of totality, he directed the telescope, according to my instructions, upon the faint part of t!ie corona, about 12' from the edge of the moon, and seized e>ery opportunity offere<l by openings among the clouds previous to the re-appearance of the sun to obtain for me a >iew of the coronal light unmixed with reflected rays. Ile several times reported, "Now it is clca1и here;" and on looking into the spectroscope I saw a continuous spectrum, not very faint, with four bright lines. The appearance remained unaltered, except in brightness, as Mr. Clark moved the instrument from point to point of the corona. I carefully registered these lines 011 the silYer plate, and then requested Mr. Cla1иk to move the instrument away from the sun until the lines should disappear. As he did so, I trie<l to note the order of disappearance of the lines. They all disappeared nearly at the same time, having previously faded out together, one of them, which proves to be that known as 1474, seeming to be somewhat, more persistent than the rest. 'Vhen the lines had all vanished, 1\fr. Clark reported that the instrument was then pointed about :!5' from the sun. The double-threaded screw which moved the telescope of my spectroscope enahlml me to sweep rapiclly from one end of the spectrum to the other. During my examination of the corona l looked carefully for dark lines, and saw none. I examinell critically the whole region above F, an<l saw nothing but a continuous spectrum. J looked for lines here hecamm I haиl set'n hroa<l lines near IT in 1869. Some standarll solar lines hall beeu registered on the silYer plate before the total ]JhaAC\ arnl the plate bad been mornd as has been described to receive the lines of the corona. Aftn thP total phase, the principal lines of the solar spectrum, as high as F, were again registered. The cross-wires in the spectroscope bad been made very coarse for fear that it would be <liflicult to see them. No such difficulty was found, and with finer wires the precision of the pointings upon the lines might probably have been somewhat increased. Bnt no cousiderahle error can baye occurred, since the dark lines registered be.fore the total phase agree well witl1 those registerPиl after it, and the same Hues ruled on mica at the present time can he 1>npP.rpo11e<l on tho1>e recordf><l upon the plat.c, which have in fact thus been identified. An examination of the silver plate shows that the coronal lines observe(] were C, a line nrar D, 1474, and F. C and F agree exactly with the dark lines. The line near n is less refrangible than the sodium line D, by a difference greater than I supposed the error of ohser>ation could he. Line 1474 is ruled a little more refrangible than Kirchhoff's line, perhaps not more than can he attributed to an error of observation under the circumstances. The last adjustments of my own instrument were completed at 11 o'clock on the morning of the 21st, and at that time the sky was perfectly elear, and there was every reason to hope for fair weather on the day of the eclipse. Our preparations were complete; nothing thatcouhl be thought of bad been neglected; all of the party were experienced observers; each was familiar with his instrument, and with one or two exceptions had been out to observe the eclipse of 1869. At 4 a. m. on December 22, I found the heavens nearly covered with clouds, and every appearance of an approa-0hing storm. From that time to the very instant of totality the prospect was disheartening; aml while we have to regret that much of the Ya1ne of our work was lost or impaired by the clouds, it is even now a matter of surprise to me, when I recall all the circumstances, t.hat so much was done aml that so many things were seeu.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF
TNSTRUJ\rENTS.

For the observation of the eclipse I used the large equatorial previously mentioned, armed with the Clark spectroscope. The telescope is a very good one. The spherical aberration is very nicely corrected, but the correction for color is somewhat overdone, (as is the case with most of the l\lunich glasses,) the foens for the U line being about ] ;)mm nearer to the object-glass than that for G. This is, however, of comparatirnly little impOI'tm1ce in spectroscopic ollserYation. The driving-clock perhaps deserves something more than a passing notice, on account of certain peculiar features which I believe are new. It is one of tlie small machines such as :Merz & Son have been accustomed to furnish with their instruments, iиegulated by Fraunhofer's centrifuga,l friction governor, and although it went very fairly when everything was new and in perfect order, it has far too little power to drive so large an instrument under ontf~ary conditfons. But I haye succeeded in bringing it to satisfactory performance by the following simple modification: The axis of the driving-screw revolves (when the clock-work is running accurately) once iu 7 seconds. Upon this axis is secured a wheel with seYen teeth like tlwse of a scape-wheel. Ry m1justiug the goYemor so that it will, when left to itself, run a little too fast, and then slightly checking this wheel eYery second, it is evidently possible to Recure a very close approximation to uniform motion, the principle being precisely the same as in Bond's spring-governor. This neces:mry periodical check is obtained tlrns: The armature of an electro-magnet is attached to a lever which carries at its extremity a piece of watch-spring about 25mm long. иwhile the current is flowing thro~1gh the coils of the magnet, this spring is pushed down between the teeth of the Rca.pe-wheel, and would stop the machine entirely if allowed to remain tl1ere; but the magnet being connected with a clock which breaks the circuit every second, tho spring is then drawn hack for an instant and the tooth allowed to pass, having been merely checkecl a little, just enongh to prevent. the clock-work from running aheacl. Fig. 2 is designed to illustrate the arrangement.

In the observatory tl1e magnet is connected with the solar clock if the telescope is to follow the motion of the Run; with the sidereal if a star is under observation. But having no clock at Jerez which could be conveniently used for this pUl'pose, I had recourse to an expedient suggested by Professor 'Yinlock, which answered admirably. A seconds pendulum, with a break-circuit attachment, but without other appendages, was mounted upon the relescope pier, and kept in motion by an occasional touch of the finger. It would swing without requiring any attention for about ten minutes at a time, and whenever the arc of vibration was too much re(luced, the peculiar sound of the magnet at once attracted notice and called for the needed impulse. I am confident that the plan of connecting the driving clock of an equatorial with the standard clock of the observatory, in some such way as I have described, will be found exceedingly satisfactory by any one who may try it~a vast saving of annoyance and vexation by rendering un-

necessary the continual adjustments which are otherwise required hy slight chauge;.; of Lalance iu the instrument, variations of temperature, &c. If the performance of the driving--clock before being thus controlled be simply tolerable, then when connected with the standard clock it lH:l'.OlllCS as perfect as the clock itself, provided, of course, that the polar axis is accuratel.r adjusted. For the purpose of mounting the equatorial, a large post alJout 25 centiwcter>: :-;(1uare was set into the ground to the depth of a meter, and the top was sawed off at an angle a little greater than the latitude of the place, the inclination being roughly measured b.Y tlle clinometer. Upon the top of the post was secured, hy a single strong bolt near the upper extremity of the slope, a piece of plank alJout 20 centimeters wide by iGO in length; to this was firmly bolted the bed-plate of the polar axis. The plank being thus fastcue<l to the post at one point only, it was possible to swing it around enough for the needed. azimuthal adjustment, aud by dridng wedges between the top of the post and the plank, slight changes of the inиnation of the polar axis could IJe readily eflected; at the sallle time the weight of the telescope and its mountings was abundantly sufficient to keep everything in place unless purposely disturbed. The spectroscope was attached to the telescope by a stiff tube of hard lm1~:-; about;;~ millimeters in diameter. This is clamped to the tail-piece of the telescope by a pair of strong rings; aud in a similar manner the frame of the spectroscope is secured to the rod by two clamp-screws, so that by simply loosening these the spectroscope may be brought nearer to or rernm cd farther from the telescope in order to bring the slit to the exact focns of the particular ra~и:,; of the spectrum un<ll'l' examination. To facilitate this exceedingly importaut adjustment, lines were marked upou the rod corresponding to C, D 3 , b, F, and G. Sometimes, instead of using this arraugernent, the spectroscope is sli<l to a little greater distance autl the illlage is tltro\rn up by a conc:we lens of long focus; this enlarges the image somewhat, and by sliding the lemi slightly, in or out, a most accurate adjustment of focus is a'ttainablc. But a little loss of light and iujnry to the definition from tlie action of tliis snpplenwutary lens makes the former method preferable as a general rule. A small piece of card with au orifice in its center was fastened over the slit, and no other finder was necessary, as even during the totality the image thrown upon the card was abundantly bright to enable me to point to any desired portion of the corona with perfect certainty. A little mirror was attached to the brass carrying-rod, and so arranged that with one C'~-e I could see in it the card and the image upon it, wltile the other was at tlie eye-piece of the spectroscope. As lrns IJeen mentioned before, the instrume11t was proYided with the beautiful arraugemeut of l'rofessor 'Vinlock, which, by a mere touch of the finger, records permaneutly upon a silYer plate the exact location of auy line that may be upon the cross-wires.
OBSERVATIONS.

'l'he 21st of December, the day preceding the eclipse, was perfectly clear, and I took adnwtage of it to complete the adjustments of my instrument, and to examine the circumference of the sun for prominences. There were 110 -very large ont>s, but scweral that \Yere ,иery urilliant and ,иerJи active. One on tlle northwest limb was particularly so, and its spectrum contained not ouly all the bright lines [ had ever seen before, but some new ones. I noticed especially au iron liue below C, the reversal of 655 Kirchhoff, and tlle tllree chromium lines at 1601, 1G05, and 1607 of the same scale. The red line has been seen before, hut only иrarely; on this occasion, howerer, it was so lJright that I showed it without difficulty to several of the bystanders. The chromium Jines are, l believe, entirely new. It was my intention to examiue the whole circumference of the sun on the momiug of the ecli1)se, and to map down the different protuberances. 'l'his w11s preYented b.Y the clouds, for during the nigиht the sky had become overcast, so that the prospect was exceedingly gloomy for Uf'. We made all our preparations, howeve1' 1 and a little while before the beginning" of the eclipse tbu clouds cleared away somewhat, and I was in hopes that I might be able to use the spectroscopr in obRerving the first contact.

But the chroruosplwre lines were only occasionally and faintly visible through the haze, (which even when thinnest was al ways sufficient to produce a well-defined halo of 220 radius,) and I was, therefore, unable to make a ;,;atisfactory obsonиation. I had, however, a momentary glimpse of tho moon's limb on the chrouwsphere, and announced her approach some ten seconds before Mr. Alvan G. Ulark, wlto was stan1ling very near, using the large finder of Professor \Vinlock's telescope, percein~d the coutact. llis obsenи<ition wa.s made at 1011 '.!5m J5' ~L '..l by my chronometer, which I bad preYiously set h.v the standard chronometer in ~Ir. Dean's obseryatory, allowing for the error of the standard at the time or comvarison, as given uy JUr. Dean. I suppose that taking iuto account Pn~rything, the error of my ehronometcr could hardly ha\иe been more than from 3 to .3 tenths of a second at. tlrn time of ~fr.

Immediately after the contact, I took off three of the pri,nus from the speetroscope, rmlueiog ils dispersi\-c power from 13 prisms to 7, the largest number which could be used with the registeriug apparatus. I was uot able, howenиr, to adjust the instrument and cut the comparison spectrum upon the register plate, until within a few minutes of totality, as we could only catch momentary and nusatisfactory glimpse;:; or the suu l>etween the thickening cloud::;. These seemed to grow continually denser aml more uumerou:;, so that we were all oppressed with apprehensions of total failure. But a few minutes Lefore totality, a rift of blue appeared in the west, and we hailed it as affordiug a gleam of hope. Slowly it drifted along, directing it!'! course straight toward tbe sunnow reduced to a narrow crescent. At last it reached it; in a moment more the moon had completed tlie erent, and thtwc, in clear air, between the den!le masses of hea,иy clouds, hung the beautiful spectacle. I had pnn-iowsly laid down for myself the following programme: l╗t. Obsen-atiou of 147 J, am1 ascertainment of the distance to which it could be traced from the sun"::; limh. :.!d.

In acconlauce wiU1 the programme, as soon as the sun came mtt into the cleal' sk;y, I bad adiuste<l the slit of tbe speetroscope accurately tangeuiial to the limb of the sun at the point where the last ray would rnuish, and brought the H 74 line to the cross-wires. It was already plainly bright, the atmospheric glare being so much reduced as to make it perfectly easy to see. 'fhe lines of b were alRo distinctly reversed, as were several of the iron lines near E, and l even thought that l could see the three chromium lines which I bad found the day beforl\. Yery soon, as the creseent grew narrower, they shone out unmistakably, and all the other lines 1 have mentioned became continually more conspicuous, while the dark lines of the spectrum and the i;pectrnm itself gradually faded away; until all at once, as suddenly as a bursting rocket shoots out it.s stars, the whole fieltl of view was filled with bright lines more numerous than one could count. The phenomenon waR so sudden, so unexpected,"' and so wonderfully beautiful as to force au
иIt was unexpected simply uecausti it had not been seen in 1868 and 1809. In 1869, having been led to_ expect 1>oruetbing of ihe kind by :Father Secchi's re11ort of a layer close to the sun's surface, giving a continuous spectrum, I looked for it very carefully, but failed to see it, so that on this occasion I was wholly unprepared. I now suppose that my previons failure was due to my having worked with a radial slit ; in this case the lines vrnuM be so sho1иt {from 0''.5 to 111 .f>) that they might easily escape observation. It is of course possible tliat the phenomenon may have been caused by some unusual disturliance in the solar atи muspbere, (such as Mr. Lockyer bas already seen on one occasion,) by which the ~knser vapors we1иe carried up into tbe diroruosphere. If, however,- as seems much more prolJable, the layer always exists, and is the true birthplace ol the }'raunhofer lines, it is quite possible that it may be lletecte1l even without an eclipse by observations made at some elevated station, such, for in5tance, as Sherman, at the summit of the Pacific Uailroad.

In 186!} Professor Pickering olJservecl the eclipse with an ordinary chemical spectroscope of one prism, unattached to a tele8cope. In this-war he obtained a spectrum due to the totitl light from the whole mass of luminosity ;mrrounding the sun within a dh;tanee of 3 m 4 degrees. He reported a. contiuuous spectrum, in wl1iclt, however, there were sen~ral bright lines, one in the red near C, another uear n, aml a third near E, brigиhter than citlter of tlm otlwrR.

This arm was moved by a tangent screw, and an arrangement was fitted to it with which the exact position of the telescope at any moment could he registeretl by tlte puncture of a needle-point upon a piece of card, a rough~ but effective imitation of the more elegant registering-apparatus attached to the other instruments.

REPORT 0.1<""' THE SUPERINTENDEN1' OF
OBSERVA'l'IONS BY MR. PYE.

Mr. \\-alter P~иe, a young English gentleman, who was Rpending the winter in Jerez for the benefit of his health, had kiudl~и offered his scrYiccs as an assistant in any obsenations tlHLt might lie desirable. As he had had some experience in spectrum analysis, arnl as there still remained anotheiи spectmscope m1pr0Yi<led with an obseryer, this was assigned to him. The instrument was a star spectroscope belonging to the obsl~rn1tory of HarYard College, with a single prism of extra dense yellmY glass haYing a refractiug angle of Goo. The telescope and collimator had en ch an aperture of 23 1 ~"' and a focal length of about 1S01"rn. Its dispersiYe power was ~mch that it slwwed without much clifficulty the four lines of b distinct and separate. It was prodded with the regist.criug apparatus of Professor Winlock. This iu'itrument was mounteu on the same general plan as .:Ur. ,.\J)bay's; but tu secure morn light, at the sa.me time allowing the slit. to recciYe its illumination from the whole coronal region, I employed the followiug deYicc: A small tele8rnpe, magnifyingи about 21 timet'l, with a fieltl of about. 7░, was carefully adjusted for distinct distant Yision of a remote object, i. e. so that the rays from any portion of the object <t▒'ter erncrging from the eye.piece should be exactly parallel to each other. 'l'his being placed front of the spectroscopo its effect is, not to form an imag-e on the slit and thus restrict the obseryed spectrum to that of some particular portion of the coronal region, but simply to magnify the angular area from which the light proceeds to a diameter of about 4░, and thus to increase the light nearly sixfold. The contriYance succeeded perfectl:r, so that although the intmment was much smaller than Mr. A..bbay's, I think it was fully its match in power and efficiency. A little more care in pointing was requisite on account of the cornlem;i11g telescope, as we cnlled it. To facilitate the operation, a thin piece of metal, with a ronnd orifict> in it of 2 or 3 millimeter8 diamet(~r, was attached to the frame-work, and at a distance of about 30 centimeters a, card wm; placed with a circle marked upon it. The instrumeut was directed b;y bringing the spot of light formed by the orifice into the center of this circle. I append Mr. P_ye~s report, and it will be seen that his results are in perfect accordance with those obtained b:,' Profossor Pickering in 1869.

Report of Observation.
At the first inst.ant of totality tt g-reat numl1cr of bright lines were seen, t.lrn effect being as if all the dark lines of the spectTum were conyerted into bright ones; these lasted ouly for an inataut. 1 and wero seen with the slit nearly closed. Theu with a wide slit the following lines were observed: (1) C, very liright; (2) a hrighr. lino near D, probably D3; (:l) No. 1474-by far the brightest of all-peculiarly sliarp and distinct; ( 4) F, the faintest, lmt sufficiently distinct. A very small bright line also seemed to appear near 1474 for !LU intitaut, hut as it coulu uot he seen again its existи ouce is don htful. The estimated relative hrightncss of th~ lines was C, 8.5; D,, r,,5; 1474, 10.0; F, 3.0. Ou the regh;ter plateSet No. 1 are the ol>served lines. Set No. 2 are sfatnda1'd dark lines, commencing with Con the left, taken n.fter the eclipse in a very im1ierfect light, and are not very reliable; on this set are two erased lines.

WALTER PYE.

In order to brinl? out one or two points more clearly, I addressed to Mr. Pye a note making a few inquiries, and received the following as an appendix to his report:
Supplementary.
1. For al1011t two minntes before totality the eyes were shaded according to your directions. 2. I should imai:;inc that the duration of the num her of bright liues was not longer than was sufficieut to produce au im11ression on the retina, or less than t of a second. 3. I had in no way been prepared to e:xpeet thiH phenomenon, (the reversal of the Fraunhofcr lineB.) 4. No continuous spectrum was seeu after totality m1til the slit was opened, when it could be easily seen; at neither time were any dark lines observed. 5. The slit was opeutlCl until the rn~ulating screw did uot act upon it, aliont li turns of the screw.~ The b lines
would certainly have appeared as a single line and probably indistinct. 6. The small bright line near 1474 was nearer than it to the red, tliat is to the left of the register plate. It should be meutioned tl1at it was just a.t the close of Urn totality that it was looked for again, when it could not be found. JEREZ, D6CfJmber 23, 1870.

NATURE OF THE COlWNAL LIGIIT и

.Prom tlie obserTations aboye reported, it is plain that tlie corona is to a certain extent ииself. luminous, and the self-luminous matter must of course be in thfl sun's._i111111ediate neighborhood. Its spectrum certainly contains one bright line, coinciding c.ractly with tlrn :aark line of tlie solar spectrum at 1474 of Kirchlioff's scale, this coincidence heiug just as well established as that of the red and blue lines of the protuberance spectrum with the h,rdrogen lines C and F. иwhether tile corona spectrum contains other bright lines is more doubtful, altuough the observations of Father Denza, quoted in a previous note, and my own observation i11 1869, make it somewhat vrobal>le. But while it is certain that the corona is in part self-luminous, it is hardly less Ro that it shines in part by reflected light, as indicated by tlie radial polarization, which. seems to_ be pretty '5atisl'a.i;_ torily established bJи the polariscopic obserrntion;;. It might at first seem th.at if so the Fraunbofer lines must appeari in the spectrum of this reflected light, but I think a, little consideration will show that though they undoubtedl_y han~ a real existence, yet they must be so masked as to be very ditlicult of detection. The total spectrum seen in a11 instrument like i\lr. Abbay's or :Mr. Pye's is, in all prolmlJililJ-, composed of five or six di.ffereut overl,ving spectra. 1. First we lm\иe the chromosphere spectrum, characterized b.r the hydrogen lines aml D,, derived from tl.Je prominences and those portions oJ the cluиomusphere not hidden by the moon. 2. In the second place we get a true gas-spectrum of the second order, in which 1474 is the most prominent if not the only liue. The gaseous envelope from w!J ich this, line iH derhe<l ll:t8 beeu

called the leucosphcre,и to distinguish it from the chromosphere, which it far exceeds in ele'rntion and extent. 3. We have (hypothetically as yet, bnt very probably) a true continuous spectrum without any lines bright or dark, due to the incandescent solid or liquid particles near the sun-in other words, to meteoric dust or fog. For although it seems difficult to admit the theory of Mr. Proctor that the whole explanation of the corona is to be found in such meteoric matter, yet there is hardly room to doubt that it must contribute a very essential element. 4. We have as a fourth element the spectrum of the true sunlight reflected by the leucosphere and the meteoric dw;;t. This light is characterized by its radial polarization, arn1 could we examine it hy itself I haYe no doubt we should easily find in its spectrum the Frannhofor lines. 5. Overlying these is the light reflected by the pa,rticles of the earth's atmosplierc, addingи to the spectrum of course no new characteristics of its own, but only increasing the area and decreasing the intensity of the light and partially obliterating outlines and clefinition. And if, as Oudemans supposmi, cosmical dust betwee11 n8 and tlrn moon if; concP.rned in the c01'011al phenomena, then the light from this must alsoctHue into the accom1t, a light much the same as that reflected from the particles of our own air, bnt with an added <lash of true photospheric sunshine.
EX'l'ENT OF THE CORONA AS INDIOA'l'ED DY 'l'IIE SPECTIWSCOPE.

It is, of course, matter of great interest to determine the extent of the true solar corona. But t11e problem is rendered difficult by the action of our own atmosphere, which, especially when the air is somewhat hazy, expands the limits of a nebulosity in all directions, and in sucli a manner that it is not eitsy to distinguish between the atmospheric extension and the true corona either by the eye, the telescope, or the spectroscope. vVben the air is thoroughly clear, however, as in the eclipse of 1869, this atmospheri0 effect is probably insignificant, as was indicated by the fact that the hydrogen lines were sharply terminated at the boundary of the cbromosplierc. This ;year, howmиer, the case was quite different, and they were oh!'lervahle, as has been stated, as much as 4 or 5 minutes uutside of thefr proper limits. It will not do, therefore, to lay too much stress upon the fact that Professor Winlock was able to follow the 147 4 line more than 20' from the sun's limb; and yet the difference was so striking between the behaYior of the hydrogen lines, which exhibited a most marked discontinuity of brightness at the edge of the cliromospl1ere, and tbat of 1474, which simply grew uniformly fainter with tbe increasing elevation, that, personally, I have no doubt that the boundary of the true corona ha<l not been overpassed by Professor "\Yinlock. By combining, however, the observations of Mr. Pye with those of Professor Winlock and myself, it is easy to show that the luminous area, from which we derive the spectrum cbamcterized by the 1474 line, is far more extensiYe than tlie prominences aml that portion of the chromosphere visible during the eclipse. I have ventured to catl instruments like those employed by Mr. ~~bbay and Mr. Pye, integratfag spectroscopes, since they sum up in the spectrum which they show the total amount of light of each 1.lefinite refrangibility derived from the whole luminous area in the field of the collimator. This :field is, of course, a cone defined by lines dra.wn from the edge of the collimator object-glass through the center of the slit,, (neglecting the length of the slit,) and indefinitely produced. All the luminous particles within this cone contribute equally to the spectrum, and the instrument gives no means of determining in what portion of the field any particular line of the spectrum originates.
иThis term "leucosphere," first proposed, I believe, by Lieutenant Brown, at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society, last January, is in some respects objectionable, but as it is convenient, and I am not aware that any better one is in use, I employ it prnvisionally. If, as is quite possible, it finally tt1rn.~ out that the non-solar clements of the corona are only insignificant, the wor<l will be,come unnecessary; but while the question is nnder discussi-0n it is desirable to have a name for that porticm of the coronal luminosity which all conc;,<le to be solar. Mr. Lockyer would exteu<l the term "chromosphere " for tbi,и purpose, hnt that word is so satisfactory as a designation of the red hydrogen stratum that snch an eYtension hardly Aeems aclvisahle-es1lecially a~ in that ease we must invent some new name for the hydrogen atmo8phere.

.But. on the other hand, when a spt'ctroscope is attacheu fa_1 a telescope in the ortliuary manuer, the ol~ject-gfass forms a definite image upon tlrn slit when tlte instrument i:-; accurntely a1~juste11, and tlrn spect.rnm seen is simply the spectrum of that elementary portion or the lnmiuons bo<ly whose image fa1ls between the jaws of the iilit. Csed in this way, I call tlw iustrmncnt au analyzing spectroscope 'in antithesis to t.he other, since in this case we Yirtnally separate the lumiuous area iuto its elementary portions aud ex.amirw the spectrum of each portion by itself. Now in the analyzing instruments, as nearly as I can estimate, the C line is from 25 to 100 times as bright as 1474, thP light-ratio being about the same as that between a star of the first magnituue anu ouc of the fifth or sixth. If we write 50 for tl!e ratio I think we cauuot be far from right. In tl1e ,integrating instruments, on the other llan<l, accordiug to tlw obser\иations of Professor Pickeriug, in 18!i!J, and of 1\Ir. Pye, above reported, (with whieh abo agree tlle ob>ienиations oi' }lr. Abbay so far as they go,) the 1474 li11(~ is tlw hrigl1test Yisihle. }fr. Pye gives fi:ir the brightness of 1474 the number 10, and on the same scale calls C 8.5; this would indicate between them ~t light-ratio of about \ 02░ iu fa1иor of 1474. lf then we suppose the corona and cllromos]Jherc each to be of uniform brightness througl10t1t, we must eonclude that the angular area (square minuteR) snbteuued by the lencosplwre is the greater iu the ratio of at least iJO x -1,0t to 1-that is, the solar corona is a,bout 70 times as externsi \'e as tbe portio11 of the curomosphere Yisible during the eclipse. And if we were to take iuto account the fact that the chromosphere is more nearly uniform in its brightness and more definitely bounded than the leucosphcre, it is mиideut that this ratio would he somewlmt increased, since the comparison between the C and 147+ lines i;; made with the anal_yziug spectroscope ver_y near the sun's limh, where the brightness of 147'1 is far :ibo\~e its :n"crngewhere only, iudce<l, it can be seen at all except dLiring au eclipse. From cornpari;;ons of D 0 and F with 1474 we also get results substantially accordant with the aborn. It is difficnlt. to estimate accurately the aggrcgat.{l area of the prominences and chromospherP visible during the eclipse; it nиas perhaps equal to a ring 9" or 10" high arouud the sun. If so, the Ioocospbere would appear to h:we an average el(watiou of about 10', a result which agrees pre.Hy well with the photographs and drawingt1, nor is it inconsisteu t at all with tlie idea that the loug ra;rs aud fainter outside radianct╗ may also be solar appentlagPs. Ent with reference to these rays, both bright and dark, the indicatious at present do uot seem to be at all decisive. Ou the one hand the remarkable agreement between the photographs taken by our party in Spain, and those of J\Jr. Brothers, in Sicily, is au cxcec<liugly strong argument for their sol:tr origiu. On the othPr hand, howeYer, we }rn,ye in(lieations that point almost as strongly to a cislunar source. For im;tance, the curious appearances preseuted b,y Lc)rd Lindsay's photographs, and the fact that in compad11g different stations aloug tht; track of an eclipse we find that at. some (as for iustance Sioux City and ShelbyYillc, Kentucky, in 186!)) these rays are conspicnom;, while at others [Uurliugton and Springfield, in 18GB) tliey are not seen at all. Slwnld it turn out that they are ouly vh;iiJle at statiuus where tlie air is more or less hazy and turbid, tlrny must uatarally be considered as atmospheric phenomena, produced, of course, not by true photospheric smtlight, (which, as has been almnd:tntly sllown by mauy writers, cannot illuminate the air near the moon's place,) but by the light from tbe promiuc11ces and the lower regions of the Jeucosphere. If, on the contrary, as seems to he the case, this radiance appears under unexceptionable atmospheric condit10us, we are almost shut up to one of two theories: either 011 the one hand that of Professor ~orton and l\fr. Proctor, whose dews regarding these rays are nmtrl.r identical, aud represent them to be streams of matter, similar to cometar_y substance or auroral beams,"

NATURE OF THE CORONAL ENVELOPE AND ITS RELATION TO TIIE SUN и

.Another interesting series of problems relates to the substance composing the leucosphere and the relation of thil'l enYelope to the suu-whether it is a true solar atmosphere or a ruere cloud of transient particles-a flock of metl'ors, as ;\Ir. Proctor supposes. YVaiYing the difficulty of supposing 1rnch a rnnlti.tmliIJous and coutimrnl snpply of meteOTic matter as thl' theory would require, it apparently fails iu accounting for the peculiar form asi,mmed by this eni;elope, which seems to be tleepest on~r jm;t those regions where the spMs are most numerous, aud to be governed even in tlie minuti~ of its outline by the arrangement ant1 magnitude of the prominences. I find, also, another ~reat o1~jection to it in the powerful winds and cyclones which pre>ail in the regions above the chromosplwre at elt>vations as great as fifty, and eyeu one hundred thousand miles. 'l'hese winds, by which the tops of the solar flames are whirled aml driYen, present, so far as obsen-ations now go, every charncte.l'istic of true af'rial currents in a coutinuous medium; aml the whole appearance and behavior of the protuberances, except at the momen't of eruption, is that of clouds :fimLting in an air. It is impossibltи to conceive any more exact resemblance than that which exists hetwea1 the>ie objects a11d the lighter cloud:;; of our ow11 upper atmosphere. But if we then consider the lencospheiи<и a's a true solar atmosphere, how can \YEl reconcilP its enormous extent \Yith the smallness of the 1nиessmиe at its base, which seems to be establi&hed by the experirneuts of Lockyer and Frankland, a:;; well as \Vi.illnerи~ There seem to me to be two po1;sible explanations of this: first, and perhaps on the wl1ole most probable, this atmosphere ruay consist of some new kind of matter иwho:,;p, density is far below that of even hydrogen; or, ou the other hand, it may be composetl of matter whose specific gravity (not den.~ity) is diminished, annihilated, or eYen rem1ered ne.gatin\ by some solar repulsion, such as appears to be operative i11 t.11e formation of a comet's tail. It appears to Le certai11, from the obsenations of .lu1gstrom and Kirchhoff, that the 1474 line which characterizes its spectrum coincides with a line iu the fron spectrum within the limits of any preRent means of obsern1tiou; and so close a coincidence cau hardly be accidental. Yet in the spectrum of iron tl1is line is only a faiut aud unim1lortant one, one of the last to make its appearance nuder the stimulus of the electric s1mrk, a11d so little conspicuous that Mr. Huggins has failed to map it. It is) to say the least, very ditllcult to understand how, if this line he really of the sa'me origin ns its fellows, it should remain the sole survivor of changes which have exterminated all иits stronger aE>sociates; accordingly it becomes natnral to snpposc, as I sugge.sted iu 186!), that in the spectrum of iron tbit> line may be due, not to the iron its(иlf, but to some associated substance, (possibly related to the pecu1iar nrngnctic properties of this remarkable metal,) to some occluded gas wh1eh can also exist free in a state of i11co11cefrablc tenuity, as we have it in the lcucospherc, and probably also in the streamers of the aurora anti the tailR of comets-a near relative, so far as gravity is concerned, to the lmniuifHous ether all(} to the Urstoff of German speculators. \Vith this view I believe l\fr. Lock:yer agrees, so far, at least, as to think the leucosphere com11osed of a new form of matter.
several European astronomers. :My own father, more than twenty years ago, was accustomed to teach essentia.lly the tbiug; so that when jn 1869 I lliscovt>n"l (as I snppmиetl) the coincidence of the bright line in the corona spectrum with a line in that of the aurorn. and decla.rc<l my helief in the essential identity of the phenomena, I oousidered myself as simply subscribing to a view alro:uly enrrm1t, :111<1 bringiug a strong argument to its support. I rnay add further that a carnfnl obscrvMion of the anrurnl spectrum with tho uest means I have yet been able to connnan<l, and an examination of the observations of otherи, hnve convinccil mo that while thus far nothing appears whicl1 is incousislent with the ahsolntc coincidence of the two lines, still it cannot he consitlered to be established. I think the probable error of the position oHhiR aurora line, which is an (иxcee<lingly difllcnlt object, and has yet been observed only with single-prism spectroscopes, must amomit to five or six divisions of Kircl1hoff's scale.

But on tLe other hand it is certain that alterations of temperature and pressure produce great changes in spectra; and although I think uo ca;;;e is at present known where, iu the course of such changes, one of the least conspicuous lines is the most persistent arnl the last to llisappear, it hi perhaps not impossible that this may be the case with iron, and that in the upper solar atmosphere the complicated spectrum of the metal may reduce to this siIJgle line. It is certainly a curious circumstance, perhaps favoring this idea, tllat tho other iron lines which from time to time appear in the diromosphere spectrum, are nearly all of about the same or<ler of intensity as 14 74; the more conspicuous iron liues like E an<l G are neyer reYersed, wl!ile in tlle case of other substances tllcir strongest lines are the first to IJecome brigиltt. If, then, we admit a sufllcien tl,y re1mli:;h~e force, it ;,;eems still possible to suppose that the Iencoи sphere may corn;ist of -iron in the state of yapor all(l fo;:.:; arn1 the well-known wide di lfnsion of this substance in meteoric matter makes it compreliensihle how its Tines shoul<l occur in the spectrum of our own aurora arnl in any other places where the~- may be fouml It wonld sf'em tlJat we must look to the physical laboratory for light upon this su1Jject.
COX8Tl'l'U'.l'lON OF TIIE SOLA.I: ATJIOSI'IIEl:E.

From whal, has heen said iL is perhaps eYitleut tliat ram disposet1 to accept :t Yery simple view of the constitution of the solar atmosphere. Withont discussing the nature of the hotly of tlrn sun, I may perhaps .-enture to assent to the views of Zollner, who considers that the phenomena of the protuberances almost demonstrate the existence of a "Trennungs-Schicht," or crust, either solid or liquid, tltrongh which from time to time bnrRt out these masses of incandescent hydrogen. Over this, as it seems to me, lies the atmosphere, composed of ntpors and gases, each a1T1rnr1in!J itse[f or tencling to arrange itsel;f (acconl ing to the 1'ie11и8 of Dalton,) a8 if it -nиcrc the onl.IJ one in existence. That is to say the magnesium atmosphere is approximately of suell eleYatiou, aucl of such <lensit.r at each eleYation, as it would be if the ouly atmosphere of the sun were so mnch magnesium 1apor as now exists there; it beiug sup11oseu, of course, that by some extraneous means tlie surface of the sun be kept under tlte same pressure auL1 ~it tl1e same temperature as at present. According to this ziew there is near the surface of the sun a certain ln_yer, probably ltиss than five hundred miles in thickness, which contains all the gases in intimate mixture; this is tlie birthplace of the Fraunhofer lines, and I suppose I ohtained a gиlimpse of it at the moment when totalit.r began. Ascen<ling, we successiYely pass the limits abo,-c which the different gиascs do not rise, these limits being lowest for the Yapors of greatest density; the hydrogen and the unknown D 3 element, on account of theii: lightnesR, reach a much higher Jeyel than the others, while far a honи even tlH'SC towers the coronal matter. Of course I <lo not intend to ignore thP enorrnous vertical and h 01'izo11t<ll w ,n-emcu ts ,,. hi ch agitate this atmoRpltere, originating, mainly, it would seem, ia forces acting from beneath, gi\'ingto the upper :mrface of the chromosphere a form as ilTegnlar and fantm;tic as a sheet of :flame, elevating its general level to some extent, and often carrying up mngnesium, sodinm, aud iron to the very summit of the prorninenceg,* Considering also the 0losc and immediate com1edion uetlH'Cll UllUSl,pll distndiances Oil tlic solar surface, and magnetic storms on the earth, it is altogether probable that this wild commotion is accompanied by a development of ekctric force alnmllantly sufficient to account for all the observed resemblances between the corona and the electrical phenomena of our upper atmospl!er<'.
*Thero is another view of tho solar atmosphere which nmy i1erhaps be tcu:ihlcи. Since it is unsafo tn take tho

non-dotectibiUty, of a substanco by the. spectroscope as a proof of it.s absence, it is p~rhap,; not impo:;sibl" to :1ssnme
that the solar atmosphere is rouglily homogeueous throughout; only in this eaHc we rnnst also assn me the H'ry don.btful fact that the denser gases lose their luminosity at higher temperature~, and consequcntl.r at lower l<'vels. Accordmgly when we find the sodium lines reversed in a 1iroruiucucP, it "иoulll indicate, uot tlrn liringing up of sodium from a lm1иer 1cvel, but the raising of this portion of the solar atmosphere to a hi~~;l1cr than usual tcmpcmture. But I clo not see how we can reconcile a homogeneous atmospllere of 6nell elevation with tho undisputed snw.llness of the pressure at the sun's surface, to say nothing of otller diflicnlties h:irtlly Jess seriouH.

S1TGGES1'10XH WITII ItEFERENCE TO THE OBSERY.ATIO~ OF FUTURE ECLIPSES и

.At the request of Professor Peirce I annex the following notes with reference to methods of obscrn1tion, and points to wliich special attention should be directed in future eclipses.

A.-I'lwtograplly.
1. Photographs of the partial phases by Professor "Win lock's method, with a lens of long focus, for the purpose of determining the relatini positions and motions of the centers of the sun and moon. 2. Photoii:ravlis of the coroua made witu a. te1escope of large aperture (3ocm, if attaina"ble,) fitted with a lens near tlte Pye-em1, lihe the Barlow lens, only conrcx instead of concave. Tltis lens to be of such focus aml so placed as to reduce the diameter of tlle solar image to about 7.5'"'", or 1cm. Tbii> lens can be ma1k to impro.-r1 tile corrections of the object-glass for the actinic rays. Great care t-;liould be taken in adjusting the diameter of this lens, and the size and position of all stops and diaphragms, not to interfere with light coming from any point within 12░ of the sun. иwith an object-glass of the size mentioned we might expect, I think, to get a strong picture of the whole coronal region, with an exposure not excect1ing i:i seconds, aml a series of such pictures would infallibly settle the question as to how much of tlie pllenomenon i:,; cis-lunar. 3. As a sn!Jstitute for the aboYc, photographs taken with a camera of wide ar;gnlar apertm e carried by an equatorial mounting aml dock-work; or simply strapped to the tube of an equatorial, wlticlJ could he in use for Yiewing 01и shetcliing, without interfering with the photograpliy. 4. I'boiographs of a prominence big lily magnified, the image being thrown up by au eye-pieee to a scale of from f>" to 1;3 11 per millimeter, 80 as to giYe the details. This would, of course, require a large telescope, with accurate driYing-elock, and perhaps is hardly of sufficient imriortm1ce to justify the expenditure.

B.-8pectrosco1Jic observations.
1. Detenniuation of the instants of first aml last contact. 2. Careful examination of tbe cusps to see if tlle moon's lim l> in any way mol1ifles the s1>ect.rum. Brushes of red light lrnYe hcP11 reporte(1 lly Home obsenиers as appearing at the cusps; if so, what

is their Rpectrnm 'I 3. Close to tlic snu's limb look for a la;y{'r in which tlie Frmrnhofer lines originate. Just before totality it should ghиe a r1early continuous t'pcctrum, and just at the moment of totality sboultl show all tl1<1 dark lines of the spectrum (excepting of course those of terrestrial origin) reYersed. The spectrof.1cope emplo_ycd cannot lm>e too high lfa;persiYc power. The image of tlw sun should be not less tlian 1 incl! in diameter, and since the thickness of this layer docs not exceed ro100- of the sun's diameter, eYit1ently the most critical care must he exercifwd in reference to all the adjustments for focus, &e., al\d the slit should be Yery narrow. 4. Determine the thickness of this layer by noting how long the lines continue bright. Tllis will require a chronograph capable of being read to 1 t;o of a second.
NoTE.-It is possiLle, as lms Leen statPtl ul'fnrc, tlmt no snch layer exists, and that the 1'1icnomf'non seen hy l\fr. Pye and myself waи due to some unusual disturbance of the sun's surface.

5. Examine the prominence sp<>ctrurn carefully for new lines just before andиafter totality,и when the atmospheric glare is greatly reduced. Examine specially the upper part of the spectrum above F. If there are obseners enough to attend to other points, continue the obS<'rvation through toи tality, particularly noting whether anr diffuse band appears over b (not higher up in the spectrum,

E.-Physical observations.
1. \Vith a thermopile and gahиauometer measure the total radiant heat from the corona, and test it for '' quality" by interposing Yarious transparent screens of known thickness. Compare it with the heat receirnd from the uucclipsed sun by means of a Yessel of boiling water or some other constant source of heat. 2. l~orming the image of the corona iu the focus of a telescope, test the different portions of the image with a minute thermopile of a single pair, in order to ascertain the relative intensity of the heat from its different part:>. Especially ascertain how much more heat comes from the prominences than from neighboring portions of the corona. With respect to polariscopic and photometric obsenations I haye nothiug to offer. \Yith the greatest respect, I am, dear sir, yours very sincerely, U. A. YOUNG. Professor J. WINLOCK.

POINTS TO BE SPECIALLY ATTE:NDED TO IN '1'HE OBSERVATION OF FL'TURE ECLIPSES.

A.-Photographp.
1. Photograplls of the sun during the partial pliases of the eelipse, "l'l"ith a lens of from 8 to 1G meters focal length, aceordiug to Professor \Yinlock"s plan, for the purpose of determining the relative position of the centers of sun and moon. :.l. l'hotographs of the corona made "иith an eqnatorLtl of large aperture ('..l5 to 3ocm if possible) titted with a lens near the eye-end like the Barlow lens so-called, except in lieing convex instead of concaw. This lens should be of such focal length arnl so placed as to reduce the diameter of the solar image to less tllan 1cm, and could be made to improve the corrections of the object-glass for tlle actinic rays. Special care must betaken to avoid interference with tl.te impression of anything witllin three or four <legrees of the sun by any stops or diaphragms. The object, of course, should be to secure such a series of pictures as will show whether any changes take place in the coronal streamers; and, if so, whether they stand in evident relation to the moon's motion and the inequalи ities of her limb. ' 3. Photographs with an ordinary camera strapped upon the tube of an equatorial driven by dock-work, or else arranged with its optic axis parallel to the axis of the earth, and having the light thrown in by the fiat silvered mirror of a Meyerstein heliostat, I think not so good as the preceding. 4. Photographs of' the most remarkable prominences, on a large scale for tlle purpose of studying their details. The image of' the stm should be thrown up by an eye-piece to a diameter of from 15 to 2ocni, i. c. the scale of the photograph should be about 10" to the millimeter. This would of course require a large telescope.

B.-Spectroscopic observations.
1. Observations of the instant of first and last contact by means of the occu1tation and re-appearance of the chromosphere. 2. Careful examination of the cusps during the partial phase to ascertain if the moon's limb appears to modif,y in any way the spectrum of the chromosphere. Brushes of red light haye been reported by some observers as appearing at the cusps; if so, :what is their spectrum. 3. Look for a stratum close to the limb of the sun ghiug a nearly continuous spectrum just before the eclipse becomes total; and at the moment of totality giving a spectrum in which the dark Frannhofer lines arc all reversed. Pretty high dispersive power, and a very accurate aujustmcnt of the slit in the exact focus of the collimator, are essential; also care in placing the slit exactly tangential to the solar image, and precisely in its plane.

THE UNITED STATES CO.AST SURVEY.

The observation is important because, though unlikely, it is certainly not impossible that some unusual chromospheric storm, such as .!\Ir. Lockyer has once seen, may have produced the phenomenon obscr,ed by Mr. Pye and myself. 4. If the stratum is fonud, <letermine the precise duration of the reycrsal of the lines at the commencement of the totality by means of a cllronograph, and repeat the obserYation at the re-appearance of the sun, in order to ascertain the thickness of' the layer. 5. Durillg tlie partial pltase, e~pccially nPar the time of iota1ity, examine ~Yitli the higliest dispersiYe lJOWC'r a Yailable the more refrangihle portion of Hie i;pectrurn for new prominence lines. If an obsernr can be spared, this ouglit to be tlone also Juring the totality. This upper portion of the spectrum needs to be much more thoroughly studied than has yet been doue. 6. иwith a spectroscope of high dispcrsiYe power attached to a telescope oflarge angular aperture, giving an image of tlic sun not more than 1em iu diameter, cxamiue ti.Jc spectrum of the corowt for ne'.\' lines, especially determine 'rhether there are any between D:i and H 7-!. For this purpose the slit may be slightly widened. Also note the extension if any of the h~иdrogen lines aboye the ehromospliere and upon the moon's disk. 7. \Yith the same instrument and widely opened slit search for lllOBocltromatic radial beams; if any such exist they can be seen through the 1474 line i11 the same mau11er as the prominences are studied through U and lи'. Iu this way the structure of the corona will also probably come out more distinctly, being clearetl of tile diffuse light from other sources. 8. Place a Xicol's prism in front of the slit of the instrument, aud note the effect, if any, of its rotation upon the spectrum of the corona. nut ou account of the partial polarization of the light in its refraction through the prisms, any results tlrns obtained must be received witl1 reser,e, and carefully checked. 9. Examine the ::ippearance of the sun througиh a so-called meteor-spectroscope, (haying no slit or collimator.) So mucli of the corona as gi,иes the monochromatic light will be distinctly seen, while the rest will be made imlistinct. The same object may be obtained ll.'и looking at tlte sun with tlie eye uaked, antl armed with a small telescope, through a prism, or, lletter, a train of 5 or G prisms. 10. Hepeat the observations of Professor Pickering in 1869, antl of :\Iessrs. Abbay and Pye in 1870, with an integrating spectroscope, i'.. e., a simple chemical spectroscope unattached to a telescope. There remain discrepancies which need to be c~eared up. It is e.ccee11ingly important that in all cases when possible the observer of the spectroscopic phenomena of totality should ha Ye had his eyes carefully iwepared by pre.-ious seclusion in darkness for some 4 or 5 minutes.

C.-Polari.::ation.
I leave this imbject wholly to Professor Pickering and others.

D.-Photometry.
-I have nothing to offer.

E.-Geneml telescopic observations.
1. Look for the projection of the moon beyond the disk of the sun, and for brushes of light at the cusps. 2. With considerable aperture and very low power notice whether the coronal radiance shifts from one side of the sun to the other during the totality. 3. J?or the purpose of securing accuracy and rapidity in sketching, use paper prerionsJy <lidded into compartments on some convenient plan, and in the focus of the telescope (using, of course, a positive eye-piece) insert a iиiece of plane glass or mica marked in the same manner. 4. 'Vith considerable power study the base of the corona to ascertain, if possible, whether the curvature of the filaments is convex to the sun, indicating a repulgfre force. 5. 'Vith all the telescopic power at command look for nuclei in the corona, or for any signs of meteors .or comets in the sun's immediate neighborhood.

6. Possibly it is worth while to continue the search for iutra-JHercurial planets. 4. Observe dij:Ierences of color between the different pa.rts of the moon's disk, or bright spots

upon it.
1<'.-Naked-eye
obseri1ati0t~s.

1. Note any changes tllat occur in the appearance of the corona during tlle totalit,y, and differences of color in its different parts. ~- See if the outer boundary of the corona is like the boundary of a clourJ. ~~- Look for the tlark lmnds reportel1 to move over the surface of the earth at the moment of totality h.r Scccbi and otbers. 4. Note what portion of the sk;\и is darkest during the totality-it should be a ring.

G.-Physical ouscnиat'ions.
1. ::.\Ieasure the radiant heat from the corona with a thermopile and galvanometer without a telescope allll ascertain tlic effect of interposing different transparent screens of known thickness, (e. g., a screen of glass, a screen of <1nar1z, a sereen of :.ilnm, &c.,) in order to ascertain the quality of the beat. 2. ░'Vith a linear tliermopile (like tliut useu in ltosse's experiments upon the rnoou) explore the image of the eorona formed in the focus of a telescope in order to :.iscertain the relathиe temperatures of its different portions. 3. Having suspended a small magnet l>y a wire in such a manner that it Rlrnll he maintained at an angle of about 30'.:l with the magnetic meridian, obsm'\"e (by means of a mirror attached to the magnet, and a telescope with a scale) whether the magnet t1citches at all as the moon in its progress co\иers or uncovers spots and prominences, and especially whether it experiences any unusual disturbance at the beginning or end of totality. (I do not expect any.)

AI.LEGHEXY 0BSERVA'.l'OR"Ц,

A.lleglieny, Pennsylvania, Apiиil 1:;, 1811. Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report of the observations made by me, with the party under your charge, at Jerez, Spain, on the solar eclipse of December 22, 1870. Together with Captain Ernst, Professors Young and Pickering, l\Ir. lfoss, иand some members of tlie Sicilian party I left Southampton, England, on the 2Gth of XoYembcr, in the Peninsular and Oriental Cornpan;y's steamer Poonah, and reached Gibraltar on tbe eYening of December 1. Here we staid some days awaiting a boat for Cadiz, and as it seemed uncertain wl1e11 the regular steamer would le~we, Captain Ernst and I started in ad\'auce of the rest of the party in a small Spanish vessel, reaching Cadiz on the 8th and Jerez ou the !)t,h of December. I had limited the instruments taken with me, by your a(frice, to a small portalJle telescope, a Savart's polariscope, and to a polarizing solar eye-piece, and to these was added at Jerez an equatorial telescope of ~1 inches aperture, without clock-work or circles, the property of the Harvard College obsenиatory. This instrument had been fitted with a small spect.roscope, which was removed some da,ys before the eclipse. The instruments actually employedи b.r me were the following: l. The equatorial just mentioned. It has a good objective, which I haYe frequently used on close double stars with high powers, the images being sharp and free from diffuse light. Tried by all usual tests it is a more than ordinarily good glass, and if no positive results were obtained hy the direct study of the coronal structure with it, it was due to no defect of the instrument. The mouuting is by Troughton & Simms, but the tube was for the occasion bolted to an equatorial staud of iron, ma!le by Messrs. A. Clarke & Co. for anotber telescope. This iron stand rested on a pier which I had made of the only accessible material: two pieces of joist sunk to the depth of three feet below the soil, surrounded by well-rammed earth, and uniteu at the bottom and at the

top uy a capping of 2-inch plank. 'fhe irou stand was intended for use in a more northern latitude, and to bring it to approximate adjustment, the top of the wooden pier was cut at such an inclination that the bed-plate~ when bolted clown, was inclined at a sufficient angle to its normal position to bring the polar axis to the needed inclination. Tlte other adjustments of the instrument were made with as much accuracy as the absence of its circles i)ermitted, and as its c1icf office was to enable the obseryer to follow the sun during the !Jrief time of the eclipse, this was more than sufficient. Still attached to the tube was the tinder, a small telescope of about 1~ inclles aperture. The iron bed-plate and the hollow cone for recehиing tlle polar axis, which were cast in one piece, were bolted to the pier, !Jut the tube with the polar axis attached was not too liea-vy to be lifted by hrn persons, and transported at night or during rain to the shelter of the adjacent building. '.2. To the tinder of the large telescope was applied tllc Savart's polariscope, with which it was intended to stm1y the corona, with special reference to tlte plane of polarization; a matter as to which preyfons obseryers were not ngreecl. As the S:1xart is an instrument TIиIJicl1, though well adapted to dr,tect minute propOl'tions of polarized light, prr-scnts its nиsnlti; in a form easily misconstrued, it will be well to clescribe the one employecl, and the precautions taken to insure its proper m;e. This is the more necessary as many of the obsenиations made by its aid in pre\"ions edipses are so giyen iu imulishell accounts as to ka,иe their real meaning in douLt, arnl on this occasion the reimlts appeared to be conclusive as to a point hitl1erto open to ciuestion. 3. The principal telescope aboYe descrillell was iutemled for the stnrly of tlte intimate structure of the corona, near to tl1e sun, but as tlte power whiell it seemed !Jest to employ was much too high to euable the obse1Ter to Yiew the whole disk at once, a secoml telescope was used to saYe tllc loss of time in cxch:uiging- eye-pieces. Tllis was a smaller instrument, moYing in altitude and azimuth, on a tripod stand. Jt was of about 3 inellcs aperture, and 3:!- feet focal length, and was used with a terrl'strial eye-piece of a power of' 30 diameters, which embraced the whole of tlle sun, anu of the actnaily seen corona, in one field. of Yio.,,,и. A heavy wire in :the eye-piece could be rotated, and set at any c;;timatcd position angle. l liad been deeply intereste<l by the appearance of tlllи oute1и coronal rays, extending to perllaps a solar diameter from the moon, whiell l saw in the eclipse of ISG!J, with insufficient optical aitl. J\fo1иe lately it seellled, from the u11publis1Jed tcstim-ony of at least one trnstwortliy obser>er, that the coronal structure near the sun was even more remarkable. l\Iore, in fact, than one had already seen or belieYed himself to IJave seen it, filled with curves иapproximately hyperbolic, -witll tlleir vertices turned toward the BUil ; and drawings made by observers at earlier eclipses, when rescrutinized, were found to lend countenance to the idea tllat such a structure had before been seen, though it might have been imperfecUy noted. The interestingи inferences to Le drawu from such a fact would be evidently premature, till so singular and. unanticipated an observation had received general confirmation. At the same time, the study of tlie structure, of the external rays, so rernarkauly striated, (as they appeared the year before,) promised to throw light on the question of their solar or terrestrial origin. I felt, therefore, that the nse of the spectroscope and polariscope would not supersede tlw necessity of direct telPscopic scrutiny; and hoping, with a good instrument and attention clliefly directed to this point, to obtain evidence 011 disputed questions of iuterest, I gladly found this class of ohserYation, together with the use of the polariscope, assigned to me. Kuowing that Professor Pickering was to devote himself exclusively t.o polariscope phenomena, I arranged my own 'rnrk so .that our ob8ervations might as far as possiLle be supplementar.r to each other, and, having decided to giYe only a limited part of the two minutes of totality t-o this, judged that it would be best to attempt only what tllere was -time to do deliberately, and to confine myself to a determination of the existence or nonиexisteuce of radial polarization. Owing to the wPather, the direct observations, as it will be seen, though not without interest, were indecisive of the points previously mentioned, and the results obtained with the polariscope assumed relatively more importance. I return, therefore, to a description of the preparations made for the use of the latter instrumcn t. The Savart's polariscope, which I used, is of the usual size, having a XicoPs prism of about 3-inch a~erture, and crossed plates of quartz, which had been adjusted imperfectly by the maker.

160

BEPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

To use the instrument to the best advantage, the quartz plates were together rotated, relatively to the Nicol, till the bands attainecl their greatest intensity, and in this position they were then permanently fixed, so that thereafter prism and quartz plates had but one motion of rotation together. In this position the central band is in the principal section of the prism, and the quartz and ~icol being relati"rnly fixed, and the instrument receiving light polarized in one plane, the colors attain their maximum intensity, when the bands are para1lel to the plane of polarization; (in thii; ease the central band is dark;) and again they are at right angles to it, (in this case the central hand is white.) Of the colored bands in the pa,rticular instrument employed, ten or twcln1 are distinctly seen, each being oyer one degree in width, so that when the little instrument is directed to the moon, its disk is more than co-rnred by one of them, aml the corona cannot well cover two of tlw ban<ls at once. It is desirable, however, that se>eral of the bands should be seen projected on the source of light, au<l accordingly the polariscope was adjusted to the finder of the telescope al really referred to, and the magnifying power (linear) being about twelve times, the image of the moon was now found to cover four of the bands with their intervening spaces. No sensible polarization was caused by the glasses of the finder. Let the telescope be now directed to the reflection of the sun in water at apparent noon, and let the polariscope be rotate(l till tile bam1s attain their maximum intensity, at which time, if parallel to the plane of polarization, they are vertical and with the black band central, presenting the appearance indicatml in the accompanying sketch (Fig. J, Plate No. 28,) except as to color. The circle gives the relative size of tlie moon's uisk. For distiuctiou, this may be called the normal position of the instrument, wl10se relation to the telescope is also given, when that is stated to be east or west of its pier. The upper part of the milled edge at the eye-end is now marked b_y filing a notch deep enough to be distinguished in the dark, and the adjustment is completed under conditions which can be reproduced at any time, aml arc not likely to be mistaken. и If the Savart, still directed to the water, be rotated, the bands rotate with it, growing fainter till it has been turned through 45░, when they vanish; appearing again as the rotation continues, and growing stronger up to DO'.)~ when they are horizontal and again at tt maximum of intensity, but with the light barnl central. At 13J'.J they have again disappeared, and at 180░ have resumed their original appearance. The sanrn changes, in the same order~ arc rcpe<itcd through each half revolution. If we suppose the instrument to be left undisturbed in its normal position, but the plane of polarization of the incident light to be rotateu, the same 11henomena will present themselves as before. The bands remaining vertical, they will disappear when this plane has been rotated through 450, re-appear in full intensity with the light tmnd central at (JOO, and so on. If we no"W suppose a point of light behind the center of the image .of the moon in Fig. 1, and that the light is polarized in radial planes passing through thL-; point and the C~'e of the observer, it is not difficult to anticipate and render an account of the appearance to be presented. It is convention. ally shown in Fig. 2, Plate No. 28. The directions of four out of the infinite number of planes of polarization are represented by dotted lines. и The central band is in the vertical plane passing through AB. It will present a uniform intensity thougbout. 'rue extremities of the next band, O D, are crossed by the radial planes at a slight inclination near C D and at a greater a)l(l greater, as the diagonal II I is approached. Near O the intensity of the band will be slightly diminished, and it will grow progressively fainter, till it crosses the ray polarized in the plane of HI, where the band (since it here makes an angle of 450 with the plane of polarization) will disappear altogether, regaining its intensity as it approaches the horizontal line, and repeating the same changes in an in>erse order to D. Similar efl"ects will be. presented, with easily recognized modifications in the other bands, so that the general appearance will be as in :Fig. 2, Plate No. 28. "\\l'e have now considered the effect which may be anticipated in viewing light, radially polarized, and it is the appearance which the corona would be CJi:pected from the theory of our instrument to present, if its light were polarized only in planes passing through the center of the sun.

Since the sun, however, emits light fmm cYery point on its surfaec, antl is a ;;pliere of <lime11sions very considerable in rclatiou to tlle size of tlle corona, the appearance to be presented at an eclipse can hardly, on any theory, be expected to be tbat of strictly raf1ial polarization. On subsequent reflection, wllile preparing tllis report, it has seemed to me that the modifications due to tllis relati>ely great size are more important than woul<l at first appear, am1 may explain the fact that tlle bands at the time of the actual eclipse were not traced up to the limb. A.t any rate, the word" radial," which is freque~tly useu as if tlw sun\; uimension could be neglected in discussing the phenomena of polarization in the corona, must not mislead us as to the fact that it is incorrect, if usel1 in any other tlian I.lie general Rense in wltil'.11, for want of a better, I employ it. It seemed proper, before the eclipse, to rehearse the ohse1╗ations tlwn to be made; under circumstances so varied as to gfre similar conditions to auy which it coul11 be miticipated might present themsehиes. Professor Pickeriug and l pre1mretl a very simple apparntmi, wliieh ermblecl us to do this. Behind an opaque disk, subtending an angle of half a degree, was placed a lamp whose light was reflecteu to the eye by a suitable uevice, so as to lie polarizt'd in any single plaue desired, or else mdially in all planes passing through the llidden flanrn and tlle e~-e, at the pleasure of the experimenter. From trials with this artificial corona, it seemed that tllc Sannt, though ,~ery readily indicating the existence of small proportions of polarized light, !licl not so rcallily distinguish between planes of polarization at rigllt angles to ea ell other, as not to make me anticipate ditlicnlty iu determiuiug whether the plane of polarization of the real cormm was vertical or llorizontal (supposing it to be one or the otlier.) This uifficnlt.r will be understood whcu it is rewemuered that while the plane moves from ()Cl to 45░, the appearanee is radically altered, but the effect produced is the same.at 0░ and at \)0░, sa>e for a diffrrenee in the central band, only recognizable on careful scrutiny. Again, when the light was raclially polarizetl, tl10ugh the nppenrance indicated in Fig. 2 was not well marked with foelJlc light, a reliable criterion of th is condition was fountl even then to exist, by rotating the instrument. If the light was polarized in a plane, either vertical or horizontal, the bands disappeared at an angle of 45░, lmt they continued eq nally vi::iillle at all angles of position if the polarization was radial. I should not mention the preparator.v work with Professor Pickering without expressing my indebtedness to him for the kin<lness with which the results of his extensive aud exact knowledge of the subject were placeu at my service. Of his special fa,miliarity with everything, pertaining to polarizing instmrnenls in particular, I a>ailed myself with au ath-antagc that I take 11leasure in acknowledging. The morning of the 22u was cloudy, ailll gaye ab oue time little prospeet of our seeing the eclipse at all, and after the equatorial telescope was placctl on its pier the rain fell so that it was necessary to cover it. и "\Vhen all was ready, in the condition in which it ltad been arranged the day before, the equatorial was on the east of its pier, and the Sayart polariscope adjusted to the fill(ler, in the normal position described. The small telescope was on a stand so near that any of the tltree instruments conld be looked through without the observer's rising from his seat. Very ligllt neutra.l-tint shades were used on the eye-pieces of both telescopes. '.l'he position of these instmments was the most southerly of any at the station. As the time of :first contact approached tltc sun was conreJ with a Yery light haze, over which thin clouds were drifting. I had intended to watch for flrst contact, lint haviug no charge connected with observations of precision, on finding that Professor Young wished to watch the approach of the moon on the chromosphere, I offered to count time for him. I did so, and heard him say, "There it is!" some 12 or 15 seconds before the actual contact, which was unfol'tnnat~Jy bidden from the spectroscope by a cloud. Iteturuing to my own station, I awaited the approach . of totality there, and was noting the irregularities of the lunar disk, about the point where seconu contact would take place, when clouds coverell the sun altogether. Ko trace of polarization was

up to this time visible about the solar disk. Shortly after, rain began to fall, and the iustruments were left covered, while 1 retired to the shelter of the tent. I prmmme that all present must recall the depressing influence of the cloudy sky, which nearly liid the sun till the approach of totality. Not Hi minutes before the critical time which was so anxiously awaited, it seemed to me that the good fortune which saved us >rns almost beyond hope. Tlie sky was at that time nearly uniformly dark, and even when I took my seat again, a few minutes before totality, it seemed as if there was little chance. As the moment approached, the clouds broke in the >icinity of the sun, whose thin crescent now showed thi'ough the diminishing haze. The darkness was not great; and dece'.ved as to the remaining time by this, and by the irradiation which enlarged the crescent, I bent forward to look at my watch. Just as I turned my eyes, I heanl >1ome one call, "There's the corona!'' and looking np, saw it snrrounding the sun like a lowbnruing flame. I bad intended to notice how loug it .vas seen hcfore totalit,r, but I canuot ghиe this time with precision. After seeing the corona, the so-called " Baily's Beads" 'rnre formed, and tlisappeared, the crescent breaking where the prominence on the lunar limb had before been noted, and this must have occupied at least two seconds. I turned to the larger telescope, which was directed to the eastern limb of the sun, now just co\иered by the moon. Under the magnifying power of 140 diameters, there appeared a uniformly diffused nebulosit.r. No suspicion of structure existed, except for one feebly marked" dmиk ra;y," which was straightedgeu, as a shadow projected on tbe misty light, and almost exactly radial. Except for this, the coronal light was uniform in the narrow field. The base of the ray in question had a position angle of ahout 70░ reckoned from the true vertex toward the left. и After some 30 secon<ls of intent but fruitless scrutiny, I turned to the polariscope. The haze at this time was very slight indeed, and at one moment the sky to the naked eye was distinctly blue. On looking into the Savart, the field which a few minutes before was yacant of bands was now traversed hy them, vertically disposed of course, (since it was still in its normal position,) lmt surprisingly distinct for the liglit, even their color being visible. , They ended before reaching the . euges of the field, which embraced about two degrees, and did not appear to be traceable up to the ditik. I now commenced turning the little instrument; moving the notch which marked the vertex toward the right. I had tried to bring to this observation a mind free from the bias of any preconceiYed opinion, yet, as I am since conscious, I turned it under a certain prepossession that the }lolarization would prove to be in a plane either vertical or horizontal, in either of which cases the bands wouhl ,-anish at an angle of 43░. 'Yhen this point was reached, they were as vivid as before. I paused to assure myself of the fact, (looking at and feeling the mark on the circle,) and then slowly continued the rotation till it had been carried through 1soo. In all angles the band normal to the limb was the best marked, but all the bands remained distinct enough to show color in any position. Their extent from the sun I cannot give, yet as they were not distinguishedиwith certainty at the edges of a field 2░ in diameter, I should rudely estimate this average extent at 40'. I could not, as I say, follow them up to the moon's limb, and their increasing faintness as they approached it was notice<l. I did not see any bands on the moon, but my attention was directed so exclusi>ely to verifying their persistence around ft, that little weight should attach to this negative evidence. When tbe polariscope had been turned through a half revolution, it had rendered all the evidence to be obtained from it, but for greater security the rota ti on was continued through nearly 180░ more. There was no other result. There were no maxima or minima of intensity corresponding to one position angle more than another. I now turned to the smaller telescope, and placed the bar prepared in the eye-piece for that purpose, in the direction of the longest diagonal of the corona, which was roughly quadrangular in figure. I again looked at it for a few seconds with the naked eye, and without difficulty read a sentence from a printed paper lying on the table by the diffused light of the sky. The general light about me seemed much more than that of the clear sky of the eclipse of 1869. Next, setting the larger telescope on the western side of the moon, behind which the sun was to appear, I resumecl the scrutiny of the corona near the limb, without any new result till the two minutes and t-On seconds of totality had ended. Other obser>ations of less importance had been

made with the naked eye while darkness lasted; the principal results of all were written down before rising from my seat, and when I joined the other members of the party, it was with that painful feeling that precious opportunity bas gone by without having been made t11e most of, which seems to be commonly experienced at such a time, though all may ha,-e been done one can do. As we exchanged experiences, howe>er, it appeared that each had something to alld. How interesting the results of other observers were will be elsewhere told; on hearing them, all must have felt that we hacl as a party more reason to congratulate ourseh"cs on the success achieyed than to regret that it was not more absolute. Such observations as I obtained are gathered in what follo'Ws.
NAKED-EYE OilSERY ATro;-,s.

These, it slwulu be said, were made incidentally to other work on wllich tile attention was chiefly fixed. They were necessarily therefore hurried, and arc doubtless a wry partial presentation of the phenomena that might have been gathered if they bad been the ririncipal ol_\ject. The first appearance of tlie corona was at least two seconds before totality. Its outline was Yery irregnlar, tlie edge not so much serrated as looking like tongues of pale flame. I may compare it to the low flame of burning grass in a distant prairie fire, but the comparison is not exact as to color or motion. Xo color was noticed but a pearlj' white, and there was no certain scintillation or monm1ent. The height of this portion of the corona was not, I think, over :v, anll it might ha>e been much less. It was Yiewed in thh; condition only for a feTI" seconds, and its light was so yfrid that irradiation in all probability exaggerated its apparent size. A sketch taken by ~Ir. Gordon, of Jerez, excellently renders its form, though its dimensions there are somewhat greater than I should estimate tllem. During all the time of totality, the moon~s disk was lighter near the circumfcreuce than at the center. The light could be followed for perhaps one-third the radins inward. Ko flush of light was seen to pass oYer the whole disk, either at the commencement or close of totality, though this was watched for. The chromosphere was not distinguishable, except that one or two of the promi11ences could be seen, though they were inconspicuous. On looking at the outer edge of the corona, a second time, when the middle of totality was reacl1ed, its appearance seemed changed, probably on account of the mist, aml the edge was more diffuse. Still, the average width of the rcadil.rscen corona was at no time to my perception much oYer 5', in tllis respect contrasting Yery markedl;r with the impression made liy that of 1869. I say "of tile readily-seen corona," because beyond tliis it might be followed perhaps, but not with confidence. I suppose the phenomena here ltl'e to some extent "sub ective," and within what limits I haye tried hereafter to estimate.
DlREC'.l' 'l'ELESCOPIC OilSERYATIONS.

The evidence from direct telescopic scrutiny is, owing to the lack of a clear skv, of chiefly negative character. The structure which bas been alluded to, as seen or suspected by former obscnиers, must be very inconspicuous, since, on the minutest examination, with adequate power, no trace of it could be fountl in a sky clear eno.ugh to show the phenomena already detailed. It will probably be unadvisable to gi\'e the time needful to иerify or disproye its existence in any fllture eclipse which does not occm' with wholly favorable atmospheric conditions. The "dark ray'' referred to, thouglr very faiut, was well defined and perfectly straiglit; it extended to the limits of the visible corona, and its width may be given, though niguely, as probably within a minute of arc. It is probable, therefore, that it was not visible to the naked eye. Tlm "red flames" were, of course, conspicuous, and beautiful objeces in the telescope, though not more obvious or definite thau when I viewed them through the Cline of Professor Young's spectroscope the day before. The telescope during a total eclipse can add little to what the spectroscope now tells at any time of them, except as to their color, which the latter can only present by its eompoи nents. The color, as directly seen, is to me that of the part of the spectrum midway between C and D, though some of the prominences are lighter than others, and nearer to an orange than to the "rose red," or "crimson," described by the observers of 1869. This will, perhaps, indicate that

the gas or vapor giving the bright chromosphere line D 3 all around the sun, is yet in greater relative proportions in some parts of the chromosphere than in others, or under different pressure.

RESCLTS OF POLAICISCOPIC OIISERY ATIOX.

I do not undertake to determine whether the presence of mist about the sun should affect the inferences now t1rawn. If -we do not consider this objection, the fo1lo>ring conclnl'ions naturally result from the obsernitions already detailed. The light of the corona is, in tlle ordinary use of the >rord, radially polarizet1, though not in strictly radial planes if -we have regard to the large relative i:;ize of the sun. Tlie outer limit to which the evidence of radial polarization extem1s is indefinite, but is probably not less than 35' to 40' from its circumference. The light clo:se to the tfoik is not sensilJly polarized. (This is, nevertheless, it seems to me, (jUite com;i:-;teut with the possilJility of this part of the corona's sending us much refleeted light.) Considering the e>ideuce of very marketl polarization elsewhere, we may infer, I think, that the coro1ia is visilJle largely, if not chiefly, through reflected sunlight, a conclusion nowise contradicted, it seems, by the evidence of i:;elf-lmninosity from the spectroscope. What pre.:iedes embodies all of consequence that m.r notes or memory supply. On comparing the statements of different obser>ers a fact of interest seems to hayc latel.}giYen rise to question. 1 refer to what has been called the "subjectiYity ''or "personality" of tl1e imli>iunal, -whid1 has l>cen supposed to affect his >iew of phenomena seen under circumstances of i:;uch mental tension as the bre>ity aml impUTtance of tltese obseryations often induce. As increased attention is Leing paid to tliis questiou, 1 may be permitted to recm to wlta,t I h:we noticed in myself, as affording some possilJle aid to its elucidation. In August, JSG!J, the remarkable exterior rays or strearneri:; forced tliemsekes on my attention, (which was directed to an olJserYatiou of precision,) almost to the exclusion of C"rnrything but the work in hand. I have no distiuet rceollection of then noticing, иwhat was most apparent to others, the intenser inner light, for иwhich a distinct title (lencosphere) has sincfl been proposed. Tliis year, again, other work left no leisure for deliberate naked-eye observations, and what I at this time casually noticed was the complement of that seen last year. Only the light at the disk was dbtinctly obsen-eu by me, (aml by some others,) but at the same time, one competent witness, wl10 was close b,y, but, like myself, cliiefly engaged in other work, described the corona as ha-.ing to him the appearance of f/1иeater extension than that of 1869. Iu my own case anticipation did not color what was seen, since in neither instance did I see what was expected. Probably these observations would haye been accordant, but that in each case what was seen was seen furtively, ancl a part of the phenomena was impressed on the memory to the exclusion of others. If this be, as it seems, a common experience under like conditions, to reconcile such ouservations with each other and the truth, it will only be necessary to apply the rule which ordinary experience teaches with regard to conflicting testimony. To do this, after eliminating as far as possible what is personal in the usual sense, such as individual deficiencies of perception as to color a,nd so forth, we may, in diseu.-;sing discrepant and presumably subjective phenomena, attach very little -weight to negath"e testimony, but assume that what is most positive in the evidence of a conscientious observer is probably partial and incomplete rather than erroneous. If only the positive part of such testimony be collated, the rest of the so-called subjective phenomena must often cease to appear discrepa11t, aml when superposed be complementary to, rather than contradictory of, each other. I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,. S. l'. LANGLEY.

DELICACY OF DIFFEREXI IKSTU1:''\tENTS.

A number of experiments were ma<le by ::\Ir. Ross and myself with a modification of the polarimeter, \\ith two plates of glass. Au unpolarized. object was viewetl through this instrument, an<l the plates turne<l until the polarization became perceptible with the polariscope to be tested. The results were then rcducetl to percentages by :FresneFs formula. To eliminate index~error, readingA were taken on eaeh si<le of the zero, and the mean used. It was found, that the sensibility "Varied with the size of the oLject and the intensity of its light. The following series m nst therefore be regarded as sllowing comparafrrn rather tllan absolute delicacy : Limit of "Visibility of Savart's bands, 1 per cent. Limit of Tisibility of color in Sa\art's bands, 22 per cent. Color first perceptible in a small Arago polariscope with selenite giying red and green imngeA, 5 per cent. и Same with large Arago with quartz giying blue anll ;yellow, 15 per cent. ~icol prism, variation in light, (or rotating,) becomes perceptible with 10 per cent. These are the means of series of observations by l\Ir. Ross an<l myself.

An(}ther series of experiments were ma.de with a common po1arimeter, replacing the Sanirt by

a Nicol prism and the crystal to be triml. The plates were turned until the bands were distinctly
visible, equally so with all the crystals. The results were aB follows:

A tiu cone, A, was procure1l aml liue<l v.-ith ulack unglazed cambric, as this иwhite paper or clotli, wliile reflecting no more light i;;pecularly, added a large amount by diffuse rC'flection, which being unpolarized marked tLe иeffect of the other. A candle, n, was placed in frout of the cone arnl the ey{' protected from its ligLt hy a circular disk, C, representing the moon. On placing the eye in the axis of the cone, light was rerci,иed and reflected by the cloth in planes pas8iug through the axis, and hence polarize1l radially. If now one or more plates of glass, G, were inserted in front of the candle we could superimpose a m1iform polarization of all the light, and thus imitate all the effects of sk.r polarization. As the diameter of the base of 'be cone was ahont ouo foot, it should be placed at a distauce or 20 or 30 feet to give it its proper angular dimensions, or, when .-ie11erl with a telescope magnifying 30 or 40 diameters, at a distance of three or four hundred yards. .As it was necessary to use a darkened room this was impossible, and the common method of using- a collimator was impracticable on. account of the size of the object.

'Ihis dc1ice is shown in Fig. I, in which, instead of a collimator, an ordinary telescope is used~ with eye-pieces attached. Tile latter D forms a Yery minute object of A when this is placed a frw feet off, and tllis image is then remoye1l to a distance by _F, which acts as a collimator.

'ye were thus enabled to test all our polariseopes, whether attached to telescopes or not, on the same ol~ject. \Ve found as a 1иesult that wlleu ~u;in g the Savart it was a matter of extreme difficulty to recognize with certainty the radial nature of the polarization, although the presence of polarized light was i;ho'.\n in a >ery 111 arked rummer, the trouble l1eing to tell on so small an object whether the lmmh; wenи 11ark or light-centered. \Yith the Arago, on t11e other hand, the presence of polarized light was more difficult to detect, lint once seen its radial nature was obyious, the top and bottom beiug of one color, and tlie sides of a complementary tint. "\Ye also found that >,ery good results were ohtaiuetl witll a Nicol prism, especially when 'it was rotated as a dark band crossing the corona, then turned with it. It should be remembered, howe>er, that in this case the polarization was YeQ' considerable and the light feclllc, conditions in which the Nicol prism is most valuaule. 1u preparing for the obseiTation of foture eclipses I would strongl;y recommend the use of this imitation coroua, aml that nll thtи polarizers slionld be tried on it, as it affords an excellent means of testiug their emcienc~-.
THEOlU:TICAL CO:'iSIDERATIOXS.

Two theorie8 haYe hern prnposed for tlte polarization of the sky adjacent to the corona and of _Jl tlrn dark disk of the moon: first, that they were polarized radially by reflection from the corona, as when the sun is not eclipsed; and secondly, that ueing illuminated by reflection from ol0ccts heyond the limits of the shadow, they are polarr / i ized throughout in a vertical plane, or by refraction horizontally. I 11 the former case, however, the large size of the corona would 1JI / render t.he polarization of objects adjacent to it feeble, as may he seen from the discussion gi vcn below of the polarization of the corona itself; but even supposing tbe latter concentrated ; at a ;;;ingle point, the angle of incidence for the adjacent sky .-.--- 1' iYould be so great as to render the polarization -very slight. }J Ernn at a distance of 2░ it would only amount to .03 of 1 per ./} cent., while on the moon's disk, 8ince the angle of incidence would everywhere exceed 89░ 52;!', the polarization would be only one two-thousandths of one per cent. As our most delicate polariscopes scarcely show 1 per cent., it would evidently be impossible to detect such feeble polarization. Moreover, radial polarization cannot be observed so near the sun when uot eclipsed, although it should then be, if anything, greater than during totality. Of course, this discussion applies only to the sk:y yery near the sun; that at a distance may be polarized rndially. J, \Vhilc crossing tbe _Atlantic last November, I obtained a most unexpeetecl Yerification of the second theory. One morning the sun was barely Yisible through the fog, and on examining; it with the polariscope I found the fog polarized vertically 11 '/g. _j[ CYen while near the sun, probal>1y by reflection of the light from lhe water. l'reseutl.r the fog cleared a little, and the usual radial polarization appeared; then, becoming thicker, its plane became vertical, so tliat at one time I. could almost trace it to Ute sun's limb. Of course, there was no change above or below the sun, as there the plane

Thus, wllen clear, the bauds, if held yertically, rfomppeared, and as the sky cleared, the i1Iane of polal'ization could be seen to swing around to it~ nRual position. The conditions were llere the same as during an eclipse, the fog replacing the moou; my owu observation of the eclipse of 18@ agrl:'es perfectly with this theorr. The next point to be considered is what amount of polarization we should expect to find in different parts of the corona. .Any point as A, Fig-.

We see from this that at 6 1 the polarization wonld be only iO per cent., while at 30" it would be only 13 per cent.

Ha Ying performed this integration and taken proper limits, we should get H and V for a certain point of the corona. \Ye Rbould then strictly consider all other points in the same straight linf\ ~vith the obser-.er, and take the sum of their effects.

INSTRF}IBNTS.

The telescope I used was the finder of the 15-incli eqnatorial at Cambriflge. Its aperture was 3 inches, focal lengtil 4-8 inches, and its mounting equatorial. I had attached to it tbe eye-piece represented in Figure III, made by Zentmayer, of Philadelphia. A B is a common posit.ive eyc-picc~ containing a Sicol prism C .. At its focus is a slide D, with three holes, into which different polarizing plates can be placed and changed ins tautly. A B can also be drawn out and a l1igher or lower power substituted. The whole was arranged so that it could revolve and the angle be measured by a graduated circle E, and index F. One of the apertures in D was left vacant, so that the Nicol prism alone could be used; it woul<l perhaps be better to till it with a thick piece of plate glass, that the focu:,; might be the same as when the other apertures were used. The second phwe contained a biquartz, or two plates side by 8i1le, one tnruiug the ray to the right the other to the left. When this line of junctiou is parallel to the plane of polarization, both assume the same color, which is a peculiar violet tint, known as the transition or st>nsitin1 tint. Turning it 900_ the color of both becomes complementary or dull yellow; in other positions, one is red, t1ie JU other green. In the third aperture, at the suggestion of Professor Stokes, I placed tbe quartz wedges used by Bahinet., which show bauds like those of a Savart polariscope, only reversed, that iis strougest wheu inclined 45░ to the plaue of polarization,

and 'lisappearing when parallel or perpendi.<mlar to it. I at first intended to nse a Savart in this position, lmt tltis requires diverging rays aud cannot be used with a parallel beam. I also hacl a cheap 3-inch t.elescope, by Newton, for a collimator in testing the polariscopcs and for determining contacts and general obscrnttions. It was snggosted by Peofeosor Young that one cause of my not seeing any polarization in 186(} may luwe belm the small size of the coro11a. He, therefore, proposed that it should be eulargcd by placing an Arago in frout of the telescope. I accordingly strarJped a snmU French telescope as a fiuder to my larger one, and slipped a cap on the objcctiYe with a double image prism and quartz plate. This arrangement has also the mneh more important advantage of climinatiug tbe sky polarization; for while the two images of the corona arc so far separated that one only i::; visible, the second image of the sky, distant two or three degrees, overlaps the first, so that all disturbi11g effect of it is removed, aIHI we have the corona polarization alone. To measure the degree of polarization lt modification of .A.rago's polarimeter was used, consisting of four plates of gиla::;s free to turn and carrying an index and graduated circle which shows the amount of the rotation. The ol~iect to he tested is vitwrnd through them with a Savart polariscope, the bamls being placed parallel to the axis of' rotation. 'l'hc whole instrument is turned until the bands are perpendicular to the plane of polarization, when they will be \Yhite centered, and the plates are then tnrned until they <li::;appear. From the angle we can tell the amount of polarization present, since it is then just equal to that produced by the plates. We a.lso carried two A.raga's polariscopes, one con::;isting of a double image prism and qnartz plate placed at opposite ends of a tube of such a length as to ghTe two images of the quartz in contact, but not overlapping. Tile second Arago consisted of a double image prism and plate of selenite placed close togetller, and attached to thA end of a tube, the further end of which was closed by a cap with a square hole in it. One other .instrument remains to be described, name1~T' that prepared for measuring the amount of light remaining during totality. Previousи observations of this quantity are extremel.v vague, and we, therefore, attempted some more accurate mc<tsure. A. darkened box, A. B, Figure IV, was prepared about six feet long.

In this was placed a candle, C, on a slider, by which it could he placed at any distance from the aperture D. Th is slider carried a graduated scale, so that the distance C D was ghTen directly in tenths of au inch. D was closed by a disk of paper with a circle oiled in t,he center as in t11e BunT sen photonwter. The first difficulty encountered arose from the fact that the light of a candle is so different in color from that of' daylight that in no position would the spot disappear. иWe then imierted a piece of blue tissue-paper between it and the candfe, which, cutting oft' the reel rays of the latter, rnndered its color more nearly that of daylight. A more convenient method was to use a piece of glazed paper, blue on one side, which gave a spot which disappeared almost perfectly. By this arrangement we can at any time darken a room so that the obscurity shall he the same as that of. totality or compare the latter with twilight.
OBSERVATIONS.

The point selected for our observations in Jerez was the t-0p of the house of Senor Rivero, who kindly placed it at our disposal. It waR distant about half' a mile from the station of the other members of the party and commanded an excellent view of the surrounding country, especially in the direction where the shadow passe<l off. The day was cloudy and rainy, hut we obtained a tolT erable view of first c,'Qntoot and were able to watcb the gradual progress of the eclipse. Mr. Ross

took charge of the photometer and the larger Arago polariscope, but a few minutes before totality. it was so cloudy that I laid down my instruments, thinking that nothing could be seen with them, and that it would be better to devote our entire attentiou to the photometet. Fortunately, howe,иer, at the moment of totality, the clouds, although still covering the sun, became sufficiently thin to enable us to carry out our original plau, aud to obtain quite a good view of the corona. l\Ir. Ross's observations were made by making the spot disappear, thei1 drawing a line with a pencil across the scale of the photometer, setting the instrument again, drawing a second line, and so on, moving the scale each time. He thus obtained a permanent record of his readings, which were as follows:

The considerable variation in these results is doubtless due to the continual change in the clouds drifting over the sun, and probably also to the change in position of the Jlloou. '!'hey afford, however, almost the first quantitative measure of the actual intensity of tlle light during totality, and the ready means of comparing it with twilight or a cloudy day. He also made an observation with the larger Arago polariscope, holdiug it so that whru looking at a hori:r.ontal plate of glass~ (that is, wheu the. plane of polarization was vertical,) thr righthand image was yellow, the left haml one blue. Ou looking at the _corona,, the appearance represented in Fig. V, l'latc No. 28, was se<m, in which horizontal lines represent yellow and Yertical blue. Ile says: "'!'he appearance of the corona was perfectly white, that of the sky around it the opposite of that obtained with a horizontal plate; that is, the blue was on the right. The inference to be drawu from tllis would be, that the plane of polarization of the sky surrouudiug the corona was horiwntal. The colors were faint but unmistakable. I did not note the appea,rance of au:-,- color on tile surface of the moon. The color of the sky iu the right-h1111d image was a dull bluisll-p11rple, the other a dull yellow." My own observations were, however, quite at variance with this. l first used the smaller Arago with a plate of selenite, which gave red. and green images, but since it is impossible to grind selenite to as true a surface as quartz or glass, o~jects seen through it arc a little indistinct, as when seen through mica or nneveu window-glass. 1 found, however, the two images of the corona distinctly c:olored, the right-hand one red above anll below, and green ou each Bille; the other with these colors reversed, showing a radial polarization; the sky polarization was comJiarativel,Y faint. I next pullerl the prism and selcuit.e, which were fasteued together, out of tile tube, Rud repeated the observation; the sky polarization was thus eliminated, as two images distant 3░ were superimposed. The 8ame result was ohtained as before, 8howi11g that the effect could not but be Jue to sk:v polarization. I then returned to my telescope, iu which I had adjusted my bi-qm,trtz and the low power eye-piece. With this I got less conclusive results. The image was dimmed hy the clouds, thongh not sufficiently to prevent the colors from being distinctly visible. On attempting t-0 record them, however, they seemed to be continually changing, and this was probably in realit,y thf' caS(', as we know tbat a clear sky is Rtrougly polarized, while, when cloudy, no signs of tlliis phenonw1wn can he detected. Hence, every cloud crossing the moon's disk would change the colnrn. I then attempted to see if at an~- time I could detect the colors due to radial polarization, that is, green above and rel\ below, and am very confident that at one time the11e colors were present. 'l'he colors were distinctly, though faintly; yisifJle over the moon's disk and uniform on each i;ide of the line of junction of the quartz, showing tlmt the moon's disk was polarized not radially, uut in the same plane throughout. These observations took some time, aud when completed I looked at the corona with Savart not attached to a telescope. This showed l:iands on the sky which were mnch stronger on the c01и011a, and wheu turned :;o a:; to disappear 011 tlrn former, stillи remained visible on

и и the latter; thmi sbowin~ the independent polarization of the latter. Totality being now nearly over, I watched for the pas8ag-e off of the shadow. I failed to see it, however~ probably owing to the presence of the clou<ts, which rendered it difficult to tell when totality ceased. I noticed in a very marked manner the chill often described during totality, which surprised me, as I expected that the clomls would prevent much radiation. Although the thermometer stood at 62░ at first contact, during totalit,y the cold rendered my hands numb and caused my eyes to water. After totality the clouds became so thick that no further observations were possible. The only obRe1Tation of' importance during the partial phase was that, shortly before totality, I examined the sky close to the sun and fonlHl no traces of' polarization, which agrees with all the , other obsenиations in supporting the second theory of sky polarization described above. I also noticed that j11st before totality the upper point of the sun's crescent was cut off by a mountain m the moon. CONCLUSIONS.

The polariscope is an instrument so sensitive to the prer>ence of clouds that it doe:;; not seem safe to draw any decided conclusious from these observations. The principal poiut to be discnssell is the want of agreement "'ith the two Arago polariscopes used. The instruments are so easily used and the effects are so striking, it seems scarcely possible that any mistake in observing could lie made with them. I ust>d the larger one iu l 869 and obtained the same result then that, 1\Ir. Ross did, in tlie last eclipse. My recollection of it is so distinct and so utterly unlike what I saw with the small Arago this year that I am confident it cannot he a mp,re error of observatfon. Thp, next question was whether it might be due to a defect iu the instrument. But it was tested and found to be in good order beforee ach celi1lse, and has been freque11tly used for the last two years, always giving good re1mlts. Moreover, while showing no polarization in tlle corona it rnndered that of the sky wry preceptible, which proves tliat there is no defect in the instrument. Though less delicate than the other Arago, it surely ought to have sliown the marked polarization evinced by the smaller instrument. The only other possible explanation seems to he Rome pecmliarity in the condition of the light which would affect some instruments and not others. The colors in tbe two instruments are produced in entirely different ways. In the larger, which contains a plate of quartz, it is due to the unequal rotation of' the plaue of polarization of the rays of different colors. In ibe smailer Arago, on the other hand, the colors are produced by a plate of' selenite, in which the different rays having different wave length are cut off unequally. A theory presented itself which at first seemed quite plausible. The spectrosco11e shows that the light of the corona is in a great measure at least monochromatic. Now the polarization of such light can be detected by a Savart or other instrument showing variation of intensity, but not by an Arago 01и instrument !'il1owing color. To prove tbi8 I produced an image of a so.da flame by reflection, which was ;;trong-ly polarized. Viewing this with a Savart the bands were strongly marked; the light varied with a Nicol prism, but no effect was produced on viewing it with an Arago. The polarized light of the corona, howe>er, is doubtless that part which is not monochromatic, and for various otlier reasons this theory fails. There still remains, therefore, an unexplained disagreement in the observations with different Arago polariscopes, and it li! to be hoped that in fntnre eclipse,;; a'ntriety of' these instruments may be used, some with quartz, others with selenite. I have only one other suggestion to make in future observations, namely, placing at tbe diaphragm of a large portrait camera adoubleimageprisrn and strapping it to a telescope mounted equatorially ; we should thus obtain a permanent record of two images of the corona, one polarized horizontally, tile other vertically; if they were 1>olarizell radially the former would be comparatively faint above and below, the other on the sides. Sine~ the two images would he in other respeets precisely alike, we should have an excellent means of' permanently recording any polarization of the corona while that of the sky, for reasons given above, would be neutralized. Respectfully 1mbmitted.

SIR : I have the honor to submit the following report of my operatitms with tile expedition sent to Spain under your orders-by the United States Government to observe the solar eclipse of December 22, 1870. Having reached Jerez December 11, I was occupied previously to the 22d in making a topographical sketch, which I inclose, of the farm occupied as an observatory, and, when the weather permitted, in observing stars with the sextant for latitude. The topographical sketch was made by the method of " foot reconnaissance " used in the engineer department of the .Army, the instruments employed ueing a common box-compass, protractor and scale; the distances wern measurntl by pacing. The variation of the needle was measured as carefully as the instruments at band would permit from the meridian line establi,;bed by l\fr. Dean, and was found to be about 19~0 west. Ko contours are shown, the ground being so flat that those obtained with the band-level would lend no additional value to the sketch. .A plan of the buildings used for the protection of the instruments is given on a larger scale. In making this plan a small Casella theodolite and a tape-line were used. The house from tlrn top of which observations of the eclipse were taken with the lighter instruments was situated about threeeighths of a mile north-northwest from the barn. Its occupation was determined upon too late for the ground upon which it stood to be introduced into the sketch. Plate ~o. 28. In observing with the sextant I was aided by Professor Langley and Mr. Gannett, who kept the record. The weather was not favorable, and I was unable to make as many obger-.;--ations on south stars as I desired. Sufficient were obtainer!, however, to show that the eccentricity of the instrument, if any, was very slight. The site of the observations was a few feet south of the transit observatory. The chronometers were unpacked on the 13th. The e'иenings of the 13th, 14th, and 15th were cloudy. On the 16th I was able to obi'!erve Polaris. Clouds again on the 17th and 18th. On the 19th Polaris was observed, and on the 20th Polaris and /J Orionis. Tim error of the chronometer was furnished each evening h,y J\fr. Dean, who ohtainf'll it from observations with the transit instrument. The refraction correction was obtained from obsern1tions with a pocket aneroid barometer, and pocket thermometers.

with a probable error of ▒: 0. 11 66. During the eclipse my duty was to observe the general .Phenomena and structure of the corona. For this purpose I was provided иwith the comet-seeker from the Har-.;--ard Observatory, Jrnvi11g an aperture of 4.5 inches and magnifying power of 30, mounted on a solid wooden tripod. I was stationed upon the top of the house above referred to. From the time of' first contact the sun was frequently obscured by passing clouds until about a minute before totality, when they hroke away and left a cJear view of the eclipse. This clear view lasted about two-thirds of totality. Just before the final disappearance of the Run the thin crescent of light was broken into fragments, in no manner resembling what, have been described

and sketched as" Baily's Beads." Near the extremities of the crescent these fragments were so short as to appear almost like points, while at the center a considerable arc had but one break in иit when it vanished. A halo appeared about the moon a few seconds before totality, and as the sun disappeared the corona shot out in !tll its glory. Surrounding the moon's disk and immediately adjacent to it there was a bright light of varied height and of regular but blurred outline. иwhere the sun was last seen this light arose to a height of about 4'. At the opposite side it was barely visible, while halfway between it rose to about 2'. These heights are merely approximate, the light fading off so gradually that it was exceedingly difficult to fix its limit. As the eclipse progressed it became lower on the first side, increased in height on the opposite side until the sun appeared and then vanished with the rest of the corona. For want of a better name l shall call it the glow. It resembled the brief trail of bright light left by the setting sun on a clear day. It undoubtedly appertained to the sun. Its gradual unveiling on the one side and obscuration on the other settle that point. Outside of the glow streamed forth the radial portion of the coroua. To keep a distinction I shall call this portion the streamers, and when using the word corona shall refer to the glow and streamers, collectively. 'Ihe streamers extended geuerally about 15' in height, though they were considerably shorter, say 12' high, in the direction of the sun's axis. The intervening dark lines radiated from the moon's center and extended from the outer edge of the coroua to the glow, where they were lost in the brighter light. These dark lines were well marked, clearly visible to the naked eye and straight, except in those portions where the photograph shows openings. Even here I saw no curves, but an amateur observer stationed near me saw them. I bad unfortunately selected tlie opposite side of the corona for my special scrutiny. The streamers did not alter their relative positions bnt frequently flashed out at greater length and with brighter light, not unlike the flashing of the aurora borealis. :For a moment I thought this might be due to passing clouds, but the waves fla8hed constantly from the center and this fact caused me to change my opinion. The general bonndar:y of the corona was mi irregular, jagged line, though it was impossible to give it a definite outline ou account of tue flashiug and the gradual fading off of the light at the exterior. This vagueness and changing of outline will account for the failure of the attempt made by a.n amateur observer to trace an image of the corona thrown upon groundиglass by Professor Young's cometи seeker. Tbe co1or of the corona was a silver white, with a rosy tint near the moon's disk tinging the gloиw and the inner portion of the streamers. The protuberances were numerous, but I was unable to dctcctany relation between them, and the structure, shape, or dimensions of the corona. The effects of the phenomenon upon animate nature were what have often been described, and ha>e no bearing upon the scientific objects of the expedition. Very respectfully, your obedientservant, 0.

.Notes to acoompany sketch.
At the commencement of totality tbe corona appeared to consist of straight rays tolerably evenly distributed; after an interval of about 10 seconds, however, two bundles of curved rays appeared distinguishable from the other parts by a rather greater length, and withotit any definite limits. The remaining portions seemed to extend about half the diameter of the disk, all roundи The tint of the corona was a light grayish-blue, and was darker over the prominences. Between the curved portions a bright prominence was seen of branched shape and distinct form. On the right upper surface a brilliant corruscatfon formed the distinguishing feature, in

length about one-fiftlt of the circumference, but of inconsiderable width; there were also three other sharply defined prominences. The prominences appeared coincident in duration witll the totality; the corona, however; seemed to continue a short time longer, no estimation of which c0uld be made owing to the clouds.

In my letter of January 12, I mentioned the peculiarities exbibitell h.v th:> expansion of the bluff; and now state them more particularly. 1. 'l'he bluff is about one-third of a mile from thfl ocPan hcaeh, atl(l the space betweeu tlicm is a low fiat, which fo partly covered by water in the rain;r season, the lowest part of the fiat being 5 or G feet aboYe the sea at low water; while the narrow line of Raml-dnneR along thP ;;;hore is ahout 13 feet above the flat. 2. Tlie bluff, as imlicatell by the contour lines, is quite steep; composed of ~mud with a sligllt mixture of clay, and sufficiently hard to rec1uire the pick to romo,'e it. It is little worn hy watercourses, arnl the top, formed of a layer of "adobe" soil, (tenacious black clay,) is not worn at all. In dry weather this adobe layer is a hard compact calm. rrhe stratification of tile bluff exhibits two strata of coan;;e sand and boulderR at certain parts, and all are nearly horizontal. The surface of the bluff is 7.1 feet above the oceau. :For the first 30 or 40 feet below the top the slope is about 1 to 1. "Cpou that part there is little or no yegetation; hut. upon the lowPr 1<1lope there is, in season, a lieayy growth of wild mustard. 3.

During the azimuth observations the promontory-like point of' bluff would twist inegularly in azimuth as much as 18". Similar results were exhibited during the ante-meridian horizontal angles, ranging as high as 10" when the observations were prolonged three hours after sunrise. 8.

The surfacfi width of tbe Yerba channel is nearly double that of the main channel, but a comparison of the pathways for deepls -laden ships reverses this re1atio11. The sectional areas, cornи pared at half tide, give to the main avenue nearly three times the magnitude of the other; and the comparison of passing volumes shows that, as a conduit, the former performs nearly six times as 11iuch serиvice as the latter. The maximum "yolocities in the thalweg are not widely different in the two cases, but the rates from shore to shore at times of maximum and mean velocities are double as great for the main channel as for the other. It appears from these data that the complete closure of the Yerba Channel would augment the velocity in the main channel only 12 per cent. If' we confine our attention to the portion of the present railroad pier which serves as a bridge only, that is to say, if we take the present wharf, exclusive of the portion containing slips and ferry-berths, we find from our observations that the reduction of Yelocity caused by the piles is 15 per cent., from which we may safely conclude that if the bridge were extended with similar construction to the island, the loss of passing volume would be less than 4,000,000 cubic yards, and the augmentation of the velocity in the main channel only 2k per cent. The south basin of San Francisco Bay is the recipient of no large fresh-water supplies even !luring the rainy season. The land waters of nearly two-thirds of the State of California find their way into tl1e Sacramento arnl San Joaquin Hivers, which unite at the head of Suisun :Bay,

Tlie physical geography of the area occupied liy the phosphate betls i:; su important, uot ouly to a proper understanding of the history of their formation, but also to a rigllt appreciation of theil' economic value, that it will lie well to set it forth briefly before we consider tlie betfa thcmselYeli. The coast of the l".'nited States, between the parallels of ~,'J:J and 3.:;o north latitude, form;.; a slrnllow and very regular westward curn. The depth of tliis bight is a bout t"иo hundred rnilt>s, and the width of the opening measured from Cape Hatteras, its uol'll.te1и11most. to Cape Florida it8 southernmost point, is not far from six hundred miles. The land which bounds this great iudentation is (juile le1el fur ll tlistauee uf ;;ume teus of miles from the shore, rarely rising more than 75 feet alloиe the title le1-d within this belt. Tl.te characters of the shore along this great bay of the Oarolinas*╗aries Yery remarkably, considering the little Tariety of vertical relief fouml there. I<'rom Cape Hatteras sontl11rnrd, for a distance of about two hundred miles, the shore is boruered by a peculiar series of low island:.;, disposed in the fashion of a banier reef. Along tLis whole shore the sancfo which comprise the outer islands seem to be in constant lllOYement, the gaps between the islands changing their positions from year to year. Tllc obserTations of the Coast Survey have given very Taluable data for the study of these peculiar reefs, but it is not necessary for us to examine their history. South of Cape Fear we pass beyond this system of harriers and come upon a section of shore wLid1 differs in 110 important regard from the usual type of low shore on which the sea is slowly gaining. This second section of the ba~и of the Caroliuas has a length of about one hnndretl miles, extending from Cape }'ear to Cape Uoman. 'l'lle whole coast from Cape Hattems to Cape I~omau form" tllree great iudenhttious. The northernmost of these, sometimes known as Raleigh Ilay, is eutircly fomwd by the narrow ridge of the sand-reef which separates the ocean from the broatl water of l'amplico Sound. Immediately on the south of Raleigh J3ay lies Onslow Day, which shows alou~ the whole coast-line the same structure which we find in Raleigh Bay, but somewhat less distinctly. South of the southenJ point of this bay we find less and less of this barrier reef, until, as before remarked, the coast returus to the ordinary type of a low wasting shore. Continuing southward beyond this monotonous coaRt we find, at about twcuty miles north of Cape ltoruan, the bcginniug of a new type of coasL. Insteail of barrier reef, with a considerable expanse of open water uetwccn it and the shore, tlte coast l.>egins to lie penetrated with long tiue-water creeks which cut up tLe shore region in an irregular mauuer. .From Cape Uoman to Charleston this character becomes more and more pronounced. I<rom Charleston southward as far as tlie mouth of the Saint John's lUver, in :Florida, a distance of nearly two hundred miles, the coast for a depth of from iirn to twenty miles i~ intersected by these arms of the sea to such an extent that at niany points the islands form two or three successive tiers. These. tide-water channels are to he counted by thousands, and vary from a few feet wide to sounds like the Broad Uiver at Port lfoyal, which bas a width of two or three miles. The general appearance of such a shore is not unlike what is seen on the northern part of the coast of this continent within tbe limits of what has been termed the fiord zone. The complication of outline along the Carolina and Georgia sea-border quite equals anything which can be found on the shore of :Maine or Labrador. .A careful comparison of the details of the topogra1lhy of any region in the fiord zone with what we find on this southern coast will show some essential

differences. The maps of tile Coast Survey for the island region of .l\1ai11e, if comparell with those of the sea islands, show tlte featnres in question >ery clearly, and the reader is referred to them for the character of the topograpliy of these areas, if he has not had an opportunity of studying it in the field. The most important of these differences is that the main channels of the fiord regions always run perpendicular to the shore, while in the sea islands the channels approximately parallel to the coast are more numerous than those which are perpendicular to it. It is eYident that no snch scouring as is brought about b;y glacial streams could have exca>ated the tortuous channels of the sea-island region, for, to ha>e produced such water-wa.rs, the ice cnrrent>1 would bavc bad to moye parallel to the shore, which is clearly impossible. It is by no means easy to understand just how this peculiar complication of the shore bas ueen produced, but there are some features in its structure which seem to throw a little light upon the question. Tllroughout tlie sea-island region the attenthиe observer may see that the surface of the ground fa disposed in long, -waYe-like undulations, the summits of wllich are generally parallel to tlte shore. On the innermost of the islands the action of the weather has partly ohlibиraterl these reliefs, hut owr a large part of the territory they are still quite conspicuous!' Ou Saint Ilelena Island they are peculiarly distinct, for the >alleys uet\\eeu the summits of the ridges, though illry arr only a few feet deep, are still depressed enough to connrt their bases into swamps, Ro that the alternation of upland and morass in para.lie! lines characterizes a. large part of tlw surface of this and the adjoining islands. It is clear, on even a casual inspection, that tlH1 Se relief:-; nre not the product of aerial erosion; their channels al'e rarely occupied hy streams: indeed, one way traYel fol' dn~-s among these islands without seeing m1y indications of subaerial erosion, except from tidal currents wearing a~ay some low cliff. There can be no doubt tllat tl1is contour of surface is due to submarine forces, aud that the essential features of the topograph;r of tliis region "\\ere impressed upon it before it came out of the sea. Something of this same character of surface ma;y be found l>cncath the level of the ocean along this coast,. though it is at uo point so clearly traceable as on the surface of the islands. Tllere can be little doubt that these ridger; and furrows are due to the nm of tidal currents along the shore. There seeroa to be a tendency in streams not bounded by resisting banks, such as the tidal streams which course along a shallow shore, to arrange the material they sweep o>er in long ridges. Suell a stream does not always press equally upon its floor, lmt is apt to have a banded character, or to lia>e a form which may b<' compared to senra1 streams flowing side by side and closely joined with C'ach other. Just what this is owing to it is not easy to say, but it seems not altogether improbable that the peculiar alternate strips of hot aml cold water noticed in the Gulf Stream by the officers of the Coast Surve.--, may be due to the same or a related cause. The action of currents of air upon incoherent >apor in the atmosphere forming the banded clouds, called by sailors mares' tails, ma~- possibl.v be due to thr same tendency. In order to understaud just how the sea acted upon this surface as it hegau to be lifted above it, it must be noticed that although the titles at Cape Hatteras or Cape Florida arc not more than t.wo feet in lleight, they .steadily increase as we go nearer to the center of tlw bay, until at Fort Pulaski, at the mouth of the Sa>anuall River, they arr over seYen feet in height.. This heaping up of the tide in this bay may be entirely due to the usual action of comиerging shores upon the tidal wave which flows into the hay they form, though it does not Reem as if the irnlentation was sufficiently deep to produce so great an effect. If we go back to the time when this shore began to emerge from the sea, it will be seen that where the tide was of considerable height it would tend to sweep around the low islands formetl by the upper part of the ridges before described, and to dig out the incoherent sands which formed the bottom of the troughs !Jetween them. As the shore gradually rose higher these water-wap; would be more defined; but if there was an exteusive tide-water snrface left, the scouring action would be quite decided, and these channels might in time acquire considerable depth.
~I am much indebted to Assistant C. 0. Boutelle for information on many points connected with the topography иof this region, both Bubaerial and submarine, and especially for baTing called my attention to these parallel ridges on Hilton Head Island.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

A careful reconnaissance of the shore between Capes Hatteras aml Floritla will show the observer that the sea-iSland topography begins where the tide rises abo.ve about four feet, and becomes more and more marked. as we go toward regions where the tide becomes higher and higher, or, in other words, that in a general way the amount of complication of outline of the shoreline is proportionate to the height of the tide.
GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE souи.rH CAROLINA COAST REGION.

The physical geography of this region affords the key to its geological history, or to that portion of it, at least, which has given it the character it has at present. But to understand the more ' remote history of this region we must go back to a time when the shore-line was at least two hundred miles west qf its present position. At the close of the Uretaceous era the shore of this southeastern border of the continent lay near to the base of the Alleghany Mountains. The uplifts at the close of the Eocene probably carried the shore-line some di8tance to the eastward, but just how far it is not easy to say, as subsequent wearing action has destroyed a part of the record. The elevation which closed the Miocene seems to have been far greater than that which came at the end of the preceaing period. It appears as if the shore-line must have come at some points, espedally on the southern part of South Carolina, nearly as far east ao; the present coast. Tile last considerable change ofle>el which this shore has experienced came at the close of the Pliocene era. It seems likely that this uplift carried the shore-line mnch to the eastward of its present position. The whole of the sea-island belt is being worn away hy the ocean at quite a rapid rate. The scouring action of the powerful tidal currents which flow through the fiords betweeu the islands, tears away a great tleal of the materials. over which they sweep. Along the whole seaisland belt from Winyah Bay, just north of Cape lfoman, to the mouth of the Saint JQhn River, in Florida, this erosive action has resulted in the production of a broad, slightly submerged tableland, having an average width of about eight miles and an average submergence of about three fathoms. 'l'his table of sands is very well shown on the sailing chart of the United States Coast Survey, sheet 3d. The outer part of this bank probably marks the position of the shore at the close of t11e last uplift-that which created the sea-island region. We shall soon see reasons for SllPl)OSing that this must have been au exceedingly recent occurrence in the geological sense of that word. Where\иer one of the great tide-water streams, such as the Edisto, the Coosa, or the Broad River, debouches into the sea, the coast chart shows that the sands swept out by it have built a delta which reaches beyoll(l the table-sands, and some distance out into the deeper water beyond. It is very probalJle that the coast-line was once much farther out to sea than the border of this three-fathom-deep shoal would indicate. The discovery, by Assistant Boutelle, of the Uoast Survey, of an entire skeleton of an elephas primigenius (1) on the left bank of Beaufort River, near its entrance into Broad Ri\Ter, besides being the most interesting feature in the paleontolog;r of this region, throws some light on this matter. On visiting this locality, which is situated at the point marked 11, on the reference-map, (sketch No. 24,) I found fragments of the same skeletoQ, antl the shells of species of Lymmea and Paluclira, which showed that the skeleton had been preserved in a fresh-water deposit. A glance at the position of the locality will show that the sea must have made a considerable gain upon the laud since the time when a fresh-water morass could .]Jave existed at this point. If the reader will attentively notice the way in which the Gulf Stream rnns after it leaves the straits of :Florida, he will perceive that it is thrown with great violence against a part of the coast of the bay of the Carolinas. Its current, with a velocity of two to four miles per hour, strikes against the bottom of the sea in 31░, where the water bas a clepth of only one hundred fathoms. From this point nearly to Cape Hatteras, or for most of the length of the hay of tl1e Carolinas, this stream probably t-Ouches the bottom on its inside border. There can be no doubt that this stream must exercise a certain wearing action against this part of the1:1lope of the continent. A river having the velocity of the Gulf Stream at this point, or a tidal current such as may be observed in our harbors, is capable of taking np and removing considerable quantities of detritus. Whatever erosive force the Gulf Stream may have at present, there is a great probability that in the immediate geological past its action on this sh.ore must have been quite powerful. It has been clearly shown by Professor Agassiz that the Florida coral reefli

are but the last stages in the building of that great natural breakwater, and that the whole peninsula is probably the product of the work of the existing species of polyps and acalephs, working during the last geological period. If this be so, then it follows that before the erection of the Florida mole the Gulf Stream must have swept against the shore of the Carolinas in a more direct way than it does at present. The removal of the southern half of Florida would certainly incrP.ase the violence with which the stream presses against the Carolina shore. There is, furthermore, no doubt that the regioa swept by the inner edge of the Gulf Stream iR composed of materials calculated to wear very rapidly when submitted to the action of a current of water. Although these considerations are not calculated to give us any decided assurance concerning the part which the Gulf Stream bas played in the erosion of this shore, they still make it probable that it has had no unimportant share in the shaping of the coast. It may be remarked, in passing, that there seems to be no clear evidence of recent subsidence on this coast. I am satisfied that the many facts wLich seem to indicate such action, and which have even deceived the remarkably acute Sir Charles Lyell, are really to ue attributed to a variety of minor accidents, such as the undermining of the coast uy the action of the waves, or to the rotting away of a considerable thickness of vegetable mattr beneath the smface of the ground. This view of the meaning of these supposed evidences of subsidence is ablJ~ defended hy Professor Toomey in bis report on the geology of South Carolina.*
THE GEOLOGY OF THE PHOSPHATE BEDS.

The effort to identify accurately the formations of North America with those of Europe has led in some cases to the hasty use of the names which have been applied to certain beds in the European sections, to designate American rocks. In the nomenclature of the South Carolina beds, we ha Ye what seems to be an instance of this confusion of names. In the largest work which has ,ret been published on tile geology of this region, the "Report on the Geology of South Carolina, by )fr. Tuomey,'' tlie Tertiary rocks of the State are divided. into Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene, to suit the then newly proposed classificatiou of Sir Charles I,yell. The Eoeeue Tertiary is described as occurring iu two <liffereut regions in two widely var,ying conditions. In the western part of the State the section shows, ilrst, lrnds of sandи stone and grit; second, beds of sand, gravel, and colored cla~иs; thir<l, siliceous clay; fourth i>ilicified shells; :fifth, beds of sand and il'On ore. In the shore region a great thickness of tolerably uniform marls is assumed as the equi\'alent o( this varied formation, the apparently not unreasonable view of Mr. Tuomey being that the difference in the position of these two regions relative to the !'!bore has caused the difference in the phyi;ical character of the beds. The organic contents of the supposed identical beds in the east and west regions of the State are as varied as are their physical features. The fossils of the buhr-stone, or westem beds, named in the list of Tuomey, are almost all Gasteropods and Larnellibranchiates. The general character of these shells may be accepted as rather more like the Eocene of Europe than any other member of the Tertiary series there, but their horizon has been determined, not by the comparison of the resemblances of the species, but by the fact that all tile species found in this association are extinct. But althougиh there is no apparent reason to question tbe position assigned to the buhr-stone formation, tllere must be doubt concerning the position of the beds of the shore region, which are placed as contemporaneous with it. We have in the Santee beds au assemblage of fossils very different from those occurring in the buhr-stone, and containing species, such as tbe Zengloclon cetoides, diflel'ing widely from anything found in the latter formation. Still further to the east we have again in the marls of the Ashley and Cooper Rirnrs other physical conditions, and an assemblage of fossils which it is difficult to believe coald ba\иe been. deposited in the same geological period as buhr-stone fossils. Nor can we su1)pose tllat the one
*Dr. Ravenel thinks that he ha.s recognized. the phosphate beds at the depth of about 60 feet below the surface at Charleston. If this should be verilied, we would be compelled, as will be seen hereafter, to suppose t.hat after the formation of the phosphate bed under atmospheric agencies, the shore had been depressed to the depth of at least 60 feet below its present position. It would be difficult to account for such a great subsiclence at this point, while be118 at a distance of nine mi,les to the westward have not changed their position.

series of rocks was deposited far inland, and the other near shore, for in the Ashley beds, as remarked by Mr. Tuomey, the character of the fossils shows clearly that they could not have been deposited far from the sea-border. There does not seem the same reason for questioning the identity of the Santee beds, and those found along the borders of the Ashley and the Cooper Rivers, that there is to doubt the identity of the age of the latter beds and the buhr-stone. The identity of the first-named beds does not seem to be sufficiently proven ; the contemporaneous origin of the last named is at first sight so improbaule that it cannot be accepted without direct proof, which has not been presented. The level character of a large part of the surface over which these beds in question extend makes it extremely difficult to trace by natural sections the relations of these several series of rocks. The paleontolog'ical eYidence not being clear, the matter must remain in some doubt until we haye artificial sections, which artesian wells, tapping the abundant subterranean waters of tbis region, will doubtless 11oon give. Overlying the Santee beds and the beds of the Ashley and Uooper Rivers, there are found at various points marls which are probably to be regardecl as of a Pliocene age. This is the age assigned to them b,Y Mr. ~uomey, and if we must make a division of the Tertiary section, assigning a part to each of these three names, Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene, there seems no reason to protest against the term. The extent of country covered by these beds is so small, and their disposition so irregular, that it seems necessary to suppose that a great amount of erosion has acted upon the surface, and that only patches of the formation as it once existed haye remained to the present day. These beds are of great >alue to us, however, merely as evidence of long-continued exposure of the low lands of this part of the Atlantic shore. The bed of phospha.te of lime which we have been preparing to study lies immediately on top of the "marls of the Ashley aud Cooper Rivers," as they have been generally termed, though these beds are not limited to the basins of these streams. The whole of the workable material lies in a singfo bed, from six inches to three feet in thickness. Altlwugh it Yaries in its chemical and fossil components, it retains everywhere certain marked features. It is always more or less nodular; the nodules vary much in size, some being no larger than a pAa, some a foot or more in diameter. These nodules contain, generally, one or more fragments of sllells or corals, apparently all Eocene species, which seem to have been the aggregиating points of the matter contained in the nodule. So far as my knowledge goes1 there ha\'e been few, if any, nodules found containing traces of Yertebrate remains. :Mauy of the nodules show traces of wearing, not exactly what would be expected from their being rolled as by a stream, but the style of wear which comes from being stamped and trodden on. The aJJpearance of the worn surfaces reminds me of that seen on fragments of bone from Big Bone Lick, which have been ground by the large pachyderms and ruminants which frequented that swamp. Sometimes these nodnlcs do not make up more than a considerable fraction of the bed, the remaintler being sand, pebbles, or the marl of the character found on the bed beneath. Again, the nodules are so crowded in the bed that they are soldered together into one mass, with scarce any interspaces between the separate concretions. Mingled with the concretions there is found a very variable quantity of fossil vertebrate remains; by far the greater }Jart of these consist of exceedingly worn fragments of cetacean bones . and sharks' teeth and vertebrrn, both clearly of the same species as those found lower down in the marls in the same section. Mingled with these, but comparatively rarely found, are the bones of the fossil horse, pig, mastodon, and bones and utensils of man. The last.named (ossils are almost always in a state of preservation, widely different from that of the remains of the cetaceans and selachians with which they are mingled. Their appearance indicates a comparatively recent inhuи mation. Chemical analysis shows us th:it the nodules of this deposit contain the greatest quantity of phosphateиof lime, the quantity varying at different points from 40 to nearly 70 per cent. The first and most natural seeming explanation of the large amount of this salt 1s1 that it is derived from the bones and excrements of the animals whose remains are found in the bed. But the points where the most bones are found are not those where the phosphate deposit is thickest or richest. At Chisholm's Island, on the waters of St. Helena Sound, where the bed has the greatest develи

opment yet discovered, and where the anal,ys!s shows more phosphoric acid than at some of the localities of the richest in bones, the remains of vertebrate animals are very rarely found. It is not too much to say that at this locality not one part in ten thousand of the mass is composed of vertebrate remains. Nor can we assume that the mass of phosphoric acid has been furnished by the decay of bones which have been utterly broken down; in that case we should have the remaining bones showing all degrees of preservation. Thi8, however, is not the case ; the fragments, though usually much worn, retain their structure very well. Although I went upon the ground with a disposition to regard the beds as the results of the decay of vertebrate remains, the general character of the deposit soon compelled me to seek some other explanation of its origin. It has been suggested by a distinguished chemist that the deposit was the result of the submergence of a great guano area, during which subme,rgence the hones of marine animals became mingled with the mass. There are several objections to this view : in the first place, no remains of birds have been found in the deposit, though fossils quite as likely to be destroyed are well preserved there. Then it is difficult to see how in the immediate past this swampy shore could ham been the breeding place of the quantities of birds which would have been required to have accumulated these phosphates, nor could we suppose that the climate of this shore could have been at the time of the deposition of the phosphates so different from what it is at present as would have been required to produce tbe dry conditions essential to the accumulation of a guano deposit. There is another view of the origin of these phosphate beds, which, so far as my knowledge goes, has not yet been suggested, alHl which, it seems to me, solves a part of the difficulties. The phospha,te layer rests npon a mass of marl containing a number of fossils which are found in a worn condition mingled with the phosphate nodules. The analyses of Dr. St..Julien Ravenel have shown that at several points beneath the phosphate beds the marl contains se\~eral per cent. of phosphate of lime, and it may be assumed as eminently probable tliat the whole of the marl beneath the region where the phosphate beds occur contains a certain quantity of this material, mingled with the carbonate of lime which constitutes the mass. Xow it is a well-known fact that water containing carbonic acid gas in solution has a sol vent action upon both these salts of lime, but that its power is greatest on the carbonate of lime. So that a mass of marl containing both these materials, submitted to the action of water charged with carbonic acid, might have the carbonate of lime entirely removed, and the mass left bel.Jind when the solving action ceasAd might consist almost altogether of the pl10sphate of lime. If we look a moment at the conditions which prevail in the phosphate region, we shall see that with this view we can easily frame an explanation of the formation of this phospl1ate layer. The usual section through these beds gives us on top a layer of vegetable matter and soil containing humus, through which the water percolating becomes charged with carbonic aeid; then the phosphate layer; immediately beneath that the marl containing phosphates, which i:s oul.r slightly permeable to W,Stter. Soaking over this marl the water becomes charged with carbonate of lime and some phosphate which it carries away in the drainage system of the country: This process, going on for centuries, gradually dissolves away a great thickness of the marl, and gives, as in the capping bed, an accumulation made up of fossils from the wasted beds, which resisted decay, antl could not be washed away; of phosphates which became aggregated into nodules; of remains of man and recent animals, which, falling in the swamp, sank through the soft bog and became trampled in among the nodules by the living Rnimals which inhabited this low land. Great freshets might lay down several feet of clay and sand, or some re-arranged marl on top of the phosphate layer, thus confusing the record, by making the remains of man and extinct animals associated with his early history in this region seem a part of the ancient marl beds. Looking upon the phosphate layer as the debris of a large amount of eroded marl, it is no longer a difficult matter to account for the association of fossils found there, which would be inexplicable without some theory of tbis kind. Although this view of the derivation of the phosphate beds capping the Ashley River marls seems to clear away a part of the doubt which hides their origin, it discloses another question which is about as difficult to settle. If we are to derive the phosphates from the marl, in what manner are we to account for the presence of this matrial in the latter beds иЦ I cannot say tbat

I feel any great satisfaction in the explanation which I am about to offer, which after all is only half an explanation ; but inasmuch as it promises to cast some light on what is a rather dark subject, I venture to present it. It may be premised that the whole question of the formation of phosphates is one of the little understood provinces of geological inqui!:Yи The usual supposition of the vertebrate origin of these accumulations does not fit some of the most conspicuous examples, and the ingenious hypothesis of the able chemist and geologist, Mr. T. Sterry Hunt, which a.ccounts for the origin of the massive apatite beds of the early palmozoic by the action of quantities of unarticulated Brachiopods, separating phosphate of lime from the water of the sea, though doubtless a true cause, is not competent to explain many cases of the occurrence of materials containing phospho:r:ic acid in some of its combinations. The tolernhly uniform dissemination of the phosphate of lime through the marl beneath the phosphates cannot be explained on any theory of the formation of such deposits that has come under my observation. The general characte1и of the marl underlying the phosphates is quite different from what would be su1iposed from the fact that it contains numerous vertebrate remains. It does not seem to have been a deposit formed near the shore, but rather to have been the product of those agents of deposition which work in the deeper parts of the sea. It was my good fortune to see some of the material brought up from the floor of the Gulf Stream, between Florida and Cuba, from a depth of nearly two hundred fathoms; the resemblance of the general character of this material to the marls beneath the phosphate bed is quite striking. It is by no means improbable that atthe time when these beds beneath the phosphate bed were being accumulated, the Gulf Stream flowed over them. The peninsula of Florida did not then exist, and the natural path of the stream must have been just over the region of the .Ashley River beds. The material brought up by the Coast Survey dredging work under the direction of Count Pourtales, consisting, as has just been stated, of a marly substance, resembling in a general way the marls of the .A.Hhley and Cooper Rivers, has recently been subjected to analysis, and, strange to relate, it, too, contains a considerable amount o( phosphoric acid. The analyses are not :yet complete, but will in due time be made public by the officer having these dredgings in charge ; but enough is known to make it sure that the chemical character of the materfal now accumulating on the bottom of the Gulf Stream, is likely to show a surprising likeness to that which was laid down on the sea floor where the Ashley and Cooper Rivers beds were formed. It is not the least singular part of the likeness of the materials on the Gulf Stream floor to the beds beneath the phosphates, that there, too, vertebrate remains abound. The dredge of Count Pourtales brought up from the bottom of the stream a considerable number of fragments of the bones of the du gong, or some allied animal. It might at first sight seem as if tbe occurrence of these bones afforded a sufficient explanation of the presence of phosphoric acid in the material composing the floor of the Guif Stream, but here, as on the Ashley and Cooper Rivers marls, it would be necessary to suppose that a large part of the sediment falling on that floor (probably at least onethird of the mass) was the product of vertebrate animals. This is clearly by no means a probable supposition. We know that some of the pteropod mollusks, forms which are frequently abundant in the ocean at great distances from the land, have a composition not materially different from that of bones. It has even been stated, though I do not yet know by what authority, that some of the marine algre contain a large per cent. of pb.ospbate of lime. The fact of the existence of this. material in a num her of the inferior organizations of the sea makes it, in most cases, more reasonable to account for the formation of extensive masses of phosphate beds by the deposition of the remains of invertebrate species, than to suppose that they were accumulateq by vertebrate animals. If the foregoing view of the process by which the phosphate beds of South Carolina. were formed be correct, then we may draw the important conclusion, important at least in an economic point of view, that wherever the phosphate-containing marls of the South Atlantic sea-boa.rd lie in a position similar to that which they-occupy in the vicinity of Charleston, the bed of nodular phosphate is likely to be found. The United States Coast Survey is about undertaking a careful

189

examination of the region where it is likely that these beds may be found. So that this important source of wealth, not only to the States where it occurs, but to the whole country, may not want for that aid in its development which it may reasonably be expected the Government should give. There can be no do_nbt that the area of the nodular phosphats is much underestimated, though how great a part of the region where they occur contains the material in workable quantities, may remain a questionable matter. ' It seems likely that the peculiar advantages of these beds will enable them for a long time t-0 control the market for phosphates, at least in this country. They are ornr great areas, scarcely covered by the soil, so that the labor of excavating is small. The beds are, in most cases, remarkably accessible, on account of the peculiar system of lagoom; which intersect the coast. Ful'thermore, the. supply lies in a region which, more than any other in the world, is likely to require a large amount of fertilizing material of this character, to balance the waste brought about b3- the exportation of raw agricultural products. The plan for the investigation of the geology of the phosphate region, submitted with this report, embraces complete directions for the presenиation of specimens, and for recording evidences of the results ol>tained.
NoTE.-lt is a pleasure to me to acknowledge rny obligation to Dr. St. Julien RaYenel for the great assistance kindly rendered by him during my examination of the South Carolina beds; he, having l>een the first to see the commercial ya.Jue of these beds and a coustaut studcuL of t!Jeir features since t!Jeir discoYery, is uow the pernon best acquainted with their phenomena.

AS DEDCCED FRmI A DISCUSSION OP THE TIDES OF BOSTON HARBOR, DY WILLIAM rERHEL, ESQ.

CA:mmIDGE, 1\IASSAOIIUSETTS, .Tune 24, 18il.

Sm: I have the honor to snbmit the following additional report of tbe discussion of the tide-ollserntt ions made at the l~oston dr.v-dock. The object of this part of the dis<:ussion is to try whether tlle principles and metlrnd used by Laplace in determining tbe moon's mass and other constants from the ti1le-ohserYaLiolls of Brest will give Ratisfactory results when applied to the Bnston titles; and, if uot, to see wltetlrnr his conditinns, when modified by the necessary effect of frietinn depending upon a higlrnr power tlurn the first power of the veloeity, if there is any such sensible effect, will ginи better.results, and furnish a corroboration of the results which h~ve been already obtained in a different manner, alHl given in the pre>ions report. 1. Laplace, in his last tidal researches, gi\'cn in the fifth volume of the" l\iecanique celeste," gave six conditions for determining the moon\; masR and other constants, and for the verification of theory, based upon Ute relations lJetween the theoretical expressions corresponding to the mean lunar arnl solar distnrbiug forces wllen in conjunction and in opposition near tbe time of the equinoxes and the solstices, and to the lunar disturbing forces near perigee and apogee, and the observed tiual co-efficients corresponding to these forces under these six different circumstances. If these cowlitions 1Je made to refer to the exact iiuie of the equinoxes and solstices, and to the mean maximum arnl minimum of the lunar para11actic inPqnalit.r, tl1ey can be substantially expressed in the following form:

(1- 0.160 E)

in whichA = the ui.fference between the mean tidal co-efficient of the equinoctial and solsticial syzigies arnl the mean lunar tidal co-efficient, divided by the latter; B =the co-efficient of the tide depending upon the principal term in the lunar parallactic inequality di>ided by the mean lunar tidal co-efficient; () = the difference between the mean tidal co-efficient of the equinoxes at syzigy and at quadrature, and the mean lunar tidal co-efficient, divided by the latter; e = the ratio of the mean solar to the mean lunar disturbing force; and E =one-half of Laplace's x, a constant depending upon the change in the tidal co-efficient corresponding to any change in the rate of motion of the disturbing body in right ascension. The significations of e and E here are the same as in the expressions of the previous report. In the right-hand member of t!Je first equation, e (1- 0.426 E) is the expression of the co-efficient of the mean solar tide in termR of the co-efficient of the mean lunar tide. The other two terms of this member express the tidal co-efficient belonging to the term in the lunar parallactic inequality depending upon the argument of variation, which is theи same as that of the lunar phase and semi-monthly inequality. The numerical co-efficient 0.426 is equal to twice Laplace's (m. - m/), expressed in terms of the radius. The right-hand member of the second equation is the expression of the. tidal co-efficient bel9nging to the principal terms in the lunar parallactic inequality. The

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURY.EY.

191

right-hand member of the last equation is the expression of the co-efficient of the tide corre. sponding to the sum of the declination-inequalities in the forces of the muon and snn. Tlie term 0.0006 E in this expression is a very small effect, correspornJiug to an irregularity of tile moon's motion in right ascension, depending upon the node. This small term was not taken into accouut by Laplace, and its effect was insensible in the conditions formed from the tides of Brest ; but it should not be neglected in the case of the tides at Doston, ''liere its effect is much greater on account of the large value of E at tliat port. The literal expressions of the preceding con<liti011s can be <lc!luced from those of I,aplace, except the small term 0.0006 E, and the substantial identity of the two forms of tlte conditions bas been verified by obtaining the same numerical results from both forms. \Yo shall, thereferc, regard them as the same as Laplace's conditions, and, on account of their conciseness and coHYenicnce, we shall use them in this form in preference to the form in wllich Laplace lrns gi\иeu them. "\Vith the Yal ues of A, R, anrl C ohtai11c(l from obserYation, either two of' tlle preceding Pquations are sufficient for determining the unknown quantities e and E; aml if the conditions are correct, these results can then be >crified by snlJstitution in the foird. \Yhe11 c is known, the moon's niass, х,is obtained from the equations gi,-cn in the preYious report.

In order to outain tlie Yalues of' A and c in the [Jl'l'.CCl1ing CO!Hlitions, it is rnиcpssary to Jiaye the co-efficient of the mean tides of the equinoctial syzigies, the equinoctial quadratures, the sol:-;titial syzigics, and tlie solstitial quadratures. In order to determine these, Laplace u:-;etl, in th!'и ea:-;e of the syzigies, the excess of the high water of tl1c enи11i11g- o\иer tl1c low water of tho moruiug, relative to the day whicli preceded tlte s,vzigies, to the day of the syzigies, anll to tlie four Llays following the syzigy, and used in tllis \my the three syzigics of ead1 ~иeur which are mиarest to each one of the equiuoxes or solsticei:;, tloullliug the res1tlt,.; of' the 111id1lle syzigy in 1иaeh ea:-;e, in order to elimiuate tbe effects of the variation of the moou's parallax. 111 tlic quadratures he u::;ed the excess of the high water of the morningи over the 101"1" W<1ter of' the cnи11iug- nиlatinи to the day of the quadrature and to the three days which follow it for each of the p11uiuu:ses aud sulstice:-, just as in the case of the syzigics. lie used a sho1ter raugp of obsern1ti1m:-; in thP qu:idratme;;, because the change there is much more rapid tlrnn in the ,;~иzigip:-;, Jt is proposed in tllis discussion to carry out this plau in snhstautially, if Hot prt>t\istиl3и, t!Hи same 1w11111er. ~\tl(l ou aecmmt of the completeness of the set of obser1atious of the Boston llry-dock, this pLrn of I,aplaee",,; can he carried out more completely in tlle case of the Boston tide,; than Laplace was able tu do it in tlto case of the tides of Brest; for in the latter tho observations at tllc qnadraturcs were general!,\' made only three times and often only twice a da~и, so that Laplace could UH' 0111~' oue higll a,1al ouc low water of each day, whereas in the case of tlrn Boston tides, in which the obsern1tious were made without intermission both day and night, two sets of ltigh and ltrn- watt'rR could htи nst>d for each day, and the observations were maue with so great regularity tlmt only two obscrYations of all the groups used were wanting. 3. The following tables contain for each ye:u the snms or the dilforences hctwec11 l1igh water and the following low water for each of six co1rnecutive lunar days belonging to the three syzigies or quadratures nearest to the equinoxes and solstices, douhliug the resnlt8 of the mid11Ie 011n for the reason stated above. Hence, with the middle one donllled, there are eight differences for each equinox or solstice, and consequently the sums in the talJles result from Hi oliserYations. lleucc the averages at the bottom di\иided by 3'.! giHi the tillal co-efficients, or hnlf.ra.ugcs, of the tide, denoted by fo, f1, &c.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The groups of the six consecutive lunar days near the time of the s,yzigies and quadratures, denoted in the preceding tables by o, 1, &c., were so taken as to throw the maximum of the tide belonging to the syzigies or the minimum belonging to the quadratures as near the middle of the group as possible. Accordingly, the lunar day was made to commence sometimes with the upper and sometimes with the 101n:r transit, so that the maximum or minimum was thus frequently made to fall much nearer the middle than it woul<l otherwise ha\'e done. The sums of the difiereuces hetwreu l1igh water and the following 101\' water contaiuell in the columns beaded 0 are those which immel1iatcly fo1lol'.' the se\-entli transit prece(1ing the Ryzigy or the quadrature in the Coast Survey reconh;, the transit tLere used being transit C of Lubbock's notation.

This, for some reasou, is much less than l.GO days, the result obtained by a different method, an cl given i11 the pre>ious report. \Yi th tlte number of obscrYations, however, which can lie used by tlli;; method, this quantity cannot lw Yery accnratel.v determined where the tidal co-efficient of the inequality is so small us in the case of tl.Je Boston tid(иs. By taking the a\'erage of the four preceding yalues of F belonging to the syzigies am1 tlie quadratures of the equinoxes and the solstices, we get, for tlaи co-effirien1 of the nwan lunar tidr, A 0 = 4.!l.t:m feet.
If we take half the differeuce between the averag-P of tlte t"o Yalucs of F l1elonging to tlw syzigies, and that of the two values brlonging to tl1e quadratures, we get 0.703.J feet, which is the co-efficient of the sola,r tide, plus that of the small tide depending upon t lie small term in the moon's parallax having the argument of variation. '"e sball, therefore, hav<>, for tlte first constant iu our conditions (1), to be iletermiued directly from observation,

If we also take half the difference uetweeu the ayerage of the t1n1 ntlues of F belonging to the equinoctial syzigies and ;;olstitial quadratures, and the average of the two Yalnes !Jelongiug to the equinoctial quadratures and tlie solstitial syzigies, we get 0.130G fret, as an approximate tidal co-efficient belonging to the declinatiou-inequalit.y of the moon and snu combined. Tl1is would be the true value of the co-efficient., if all the observations used Lad been exact]~и at tlm time of tl111 equinoxes and solstices. But since the ollserw1tions of the three syzigies or qnadratnnиs wl1icl1 were nearest the equinoxes and solstices were used, a correction must lle applie1l to reduce the average result of the observations, so far as they affect this iueqnality, to the time of t11e equinoxes and the solstices, in order to obtain the true co-efficient of tlie ueclination-inequality. Since the average motion of the sun from one syzigy to another is H0.1)5, au<l couseqneutly the argument of the inequality changes 290.1 iu that interval, the results of the extreme syzigies or quadratures are reduced to the timfls of the middle one- by dividing by cos 2!F'.1.

But this middle syzigy or quadrature does not fall exactly at the time of tile equinox or solstice, but within a range extending from a half-interval from one syzigy or quadrature to another preceding the equinox or solstice to the same time following it, and hence the argument of the inequality varies in this interval 290,1. In the average of a great many observations we may assume ~liat they :ire equally distributed through the interval, and l1ence we shall lrn1r, '>{ JJO,ij.'J fi.1.,90 x - - - - - ~in 14░.i:i.J

Instead of the preceding reductions of the results olJtaiued from ollsenиation to make them correspond with the forces at the exact. times of the equinoxes and solstices, Laplace used the forces corresponding with the observations liy taking the sum of the squares of the declinations belonging to each individual observation use11. This was more necessary in his case since he discussed only a partial series of obser>ations to obtain his results, and consequently the effect of the moon's nocle and other inequalities could not liave heen so completely eliminated as in the case of the Boston tides, in whicli a complete series of ousern1tions have been used. The amount of both the preceding correctious is only about one-eighth of an inch, so that any possible error arising from the preceding method in obtaining so small a correction must be entirely iusensil.Jle. u. It still remains to determine from the ob::ierиations the constant B iu the second of the conditious of (1). In order to do tliis, we shall ayail ourselves of the results which haye l.Jeen already obtained with much labor, and ginn in Table III of the preceding report, using for the purpose those only falling within a ccrtaiu range at the perigee and apogee of the moon. By taking one-half the differt>nce between H 1 and TI 2, that is, of 11igh water and the following low water, since the results thus obtained will lie from a great number of ob::ierni.tions miu1e under all possible circumstances, we obtain the :werage Yalues of the tidal co-efficient contained in tlie following table, belonging to the given argnments of transit ancl moon's mean anomal.f:

The m1it in tune of tLe preceding >alues of T is thc mean time in which the moo11's mean anomaly changes mo, which is l.143 da,rs. The average of tlle preceding values of Tis 2.134, wlliclJ, !Jeing multiplieu l>y 1.1▒3 uays, gi\иes :!.439 solar days. From this we must subtract one.eightu of a lunar ua.r, or 0.129 da.r, it l>eiug onchalf the interYal from high to low water, and also the lnnititlal iuterYal, and add two days, sincl' the arguments of meau anomaly were taken for a time two days after transit to which the lnnitidal intencal refers, for reasons stateu in the preYious report. These reductions being made, we get 2.281 days for the time the maximum of this inequality follows the time of tl.Je maximum of the disturbing force. This Yalue differs ]Jut lit!:le from 2.2▒ days ohtainet1 by a different method, aud gi,~en in the prcYious report. 7. If we take one-half the difference between the mean of the two preceding Yalues of}' belonging to the perigee, and tile mean of tile t"o belonging to apogee, we get 0.8153 feet for the tidal co-efficient of the mean parallactic inequality. Hence, "\"l"e get for tlle constant, to be obbiined from 01.Jscrvation, in the second of the equations (1), .,., B _ 0.8153 _ - 4 .94:! 9 -0.HkiO "\Vitll the preceding values of A, Il, and C, obtained from obs:errntion, our conditions (1) become\ 0.1178 = e (1 - 0.42G E) + 0.0089 E ~ 0.0012 = 0.0500 E (7) { 0.0284 = 0.0SGO (1 + e) (1 - 460 B) + 0.000G E 8. Laplace, in tile case of the tides of Brest, sol>ed the first and third, (1), or tlleir equi\-alentoi, with A.and C determined fromobserYation, and thus obtained the two unknown q nan ti ties corresponding to our e and E, and from the former of these two he determined the moon's mass to be very nearly -./5 of that of the eartll. But the results which he tllus obtained, substituted in the seconu equation, gave the value of B, the tidal co-efficient of the parallactic inequality, about one-tenth part, or 1.5 inches, too large for observation; so that, alth~ugh his mass of the moon is pt:>rl.iaps not much in error, his results obtained from the :first aud third conditions did not satisfy the second, and he admitted that the discrepancy dill not fall within the limits of the errors of ol>scn-ation. If we now take the same two conditions in the case of the Iloston tides, they become, with the

The

= -h

If we now, by way of 'Verification, substitute the preceding value of E in the second of (1), we

get a value of B about one-half, or nearly five inches, too large for that obtained from obser\ation.
It is seen, then, that, in the case of the Boston tides, Laplace's conditions, or their equivalents,

(1 + F) B = O.JG.38 + 0.0500 E (l + F) C = 0.0860 (1 + e) (1 - 0.4-GO E) + 0.0006 E The right-hand members of tl1ese conditions diffor by quantities of a second order from those of the conditions gh'en in the pre'Vious report, depending upon different developments, while there is a corresponding difference in the quantities in the left-hand members, which have to be obtained from observation by v-ery different methods in the two cases. Hence, the latter conditions furnish a very good check upon the former, both so far as t11eoretical errors are concerned and also unavoidable inaccuracies in obtaining the quantities in the left-band members from a discussion of the observations. The solution of the i)rececliug equations, using for A, B, and C the T"alues which liave been obtained from observation, givese = 0.4.275 E = 1.4-64 F =0.484 With this value of e (2) gi>es, for the moon's mass, 1 . p. = 75.i (8)

cannot be e\en approximately satisfied by observation, and the moon's mass obtained from them by a method which is substantially the same as L_aplace's is evidently much too large. It will, no doubt, be found that the tendency of Laplace's conditions is to give in all parts a mass of the moon too large, aml that the error iA somewhat in proportion to the deviation of the conditions from those of the equilibrium-theory, that is, to the value of E. Hence, while in the case of the Boston tides, where the value of E is very large, they give a mass of the moon much too large at Brest, where the value of E is only about one-fourth as much, the mass of the moon obtained from them is perhaps not much too great. The mass of the moon which Laplace would have obtained from the first and second of his conditions, as they are given fo (1), would have been much too large, and the mass which Airy obtained from substantially the same conditions, uednced from the tides of Ireland, was nearly <loubfo the J)robably true 'Vaine. It iR readily seen from mere inspection that, in the case of the Boston tides, the same c01Hlitions, the first ancl second of (7), would ginи a nrnss ahout four times the true mass. 9. It is seen, tLe11, tLat the conditions deduced from Laplace's theory do not gi,иe, in general, a satisfactory mass of the moon, and that no mass can be obtained which will make the theory represent observation. Let us, therefore, try now whether more satisfactory results can be obtained from the theory as modified bjи the effect of friction increasing in a greater ratio than Hie first power of the v-elocity. _The introduction of such a term into the primary tidal conditions destroys their lineal character, and the effect of such a term upon the tidal co-efficient deduced from the conditions is greater in large than in small tides; and when the expression of this co-efficient is developed into terms consisting of the constant or principal term an<l the inequalities, friction is found to affect the inequalit.ies in a different ratio from that of the principal term, and consequently affects the ratios of the iueqnalities to the constant term. Hence, the conditions in the case of no-friction, or of friction increasing with the first power of the velocit;r, uecome, in the case in which it is supposed to increase in a greater ratio tlian the first power, of the following form, in which F denotes the effect of friction: (1 + F) A= e (1 - 0.4.26 E) + 0.024!) + 0.008fl E

This result, wliich is >ery nearly that obtained by Laplace from the observations at Brest, differs considerably from obtained from the conditions of the pre\иious report; but the probable error of any single determination from conditions obtained from the Boston tides is consi<le1иable on account of tbe unfavorableness of the conditions, as explained in that report. The mean of these two results is perhaps not much in error. 10. The preceding large иrnluc of F shows tbat there i:; a term of that sort needed in theory to reconcile it with observation, and the same is indicated by tbe titles at Brest, though in the latter the value of F is much less than at Boston. That this depends in a great measure, if not entirely, upon friction, I think there can be but little doubt; lmt iu cases in whichEislarge, as at Boston, it may be due in part to neglected terms in a dHeloprnent in wliich E is only the term of the first order. Or, stated otherwise, the principle assumed by Laplace, that the change in the tidal co.efficient due to a change of velocity of tlie disturbing body in right ascension is proportional to the amount of change in this velocity, may not be strictly correct, and there may be in some cases a considerable effect due to terms depending upon the squares of these changes. These effects would all haYe the same sign, and would be approximately represented by such a term as F above. 11. If we take the mean of the results obtained from both methods, we shall haYe 7 k,,. for the moon's mass obtained from the Boston tides. This mass gives 9 11 .31 for the co.efficient of the principal term of lunar nutation, and 6".85 for the co-efficient of the lunar term in the Rolar tables. Very respectfully, yours, иwl\I. FERREL.

Tile object of this paper is to gl\-e a general account of the theory of errors of olmer\-ations, with the desi;:;n of showirig wиhat the limitations to the applicability of the method of least S'J.Uares are, and what course is to be pursuell wheu that method fails. \Ve shall begiu with au elementary account of the general principles of the subject, in order to 8tate them with a little more accuracy tlrnn is commonly done. The notation employetl is one which has Leen snggested by tlte stuuy of the logic of relations. Small Roman letters will denote objects partly indeterminate. Thus Ill may denote a man, without saying what man. Small Italics will be used for relatirn terms; thus l may denote a lover. The correlates of such re la ti rn terms will be written after them on the same line; thus t m or l m may denote a tootlt of a man or a lover of a man, if m denotes man, ta tooth of aml l a lo>er of something undetermined. Then, l 11и will denote a loYer of a woman, it being indeterminate what lo>er and what woman. t l w will denote a tooth of a lover of a woman. If we wish to denote that which ls a lo,иer of all women, \Hl must ha\'e a symbol to denote all women. As [x J is commonly used in the method of least squares to denote the sum of all the quantities x, so we may write [IV J to denote all women, anu then 1 fw] will uenote something which il:l a lo>er of all women, or we may write the ~ame thing thus, 1~и. .A. re1afrvc term has a double indeterminacy, being indetenninate in reference to the relate and also in reference to the correlate. A lonr may be this lo Yer, that lover, or the other loYer, and eacll of these may be lo"Verof this, or that, or :he other. Corresponding, therefore, to the [l], which denotes all lovers, we may write {

l}

to denoh! the lo\'t>r to whomeYer he is a lover. Thus, {

l}

w

will denote a loYer of nothing but women, or we may write' the same thing thus, 'l'I'. \\~c may denote "loved by'' by K'. Corresponding to any absolute term, as man, there is a relative term, " mau that itlt as in the expression " a man that is rich." I shall denote a relative of this sort by the symbol for the absoи lute term, wiLh an imиertcd comma after it, as m,. Thus, if b denotes anything black, m, b will denote a man that is black. Let V be the relative "a general name which is applieable to.'' TllUs, 17 m will denote a general term which is applicable to some man. ym will denote a general term which is applicable to every man. vm, V" will be a general term which is applicalile to every man and to every woman. K V [ vm, V"] will denote that to which every general term is applicable which is applicable to every man and to every woman; in other words, this denotes either a man or a. woman. I shall write this for short m +. w. Zero is defined by the general equation x +. 0 = .r, whahwer x may be. Then, zero generally denotes nothing. Unity is defined !Jy the general equation x, 1 = x, whatever x may be, and then 1 generally will denote anything. But 1 and 0 have sometimes to be interpreted al:l relative terms. Now, it can lJe proved by the Jlrinciples of the logic of relatives that so considered ox o, unless x o, when o0 1; and that l x =1, unless x = o, when 10 0. It follows that ox is such a logical functio1111< of x that it signi:fie.s "the case of the non-existence of.'' while 1x is such a logical function of x that it signifies "tha case of the existence of."

Au expres1>ion like

[~],where t

is a relative term, is termed a relative nnmlwr, aYl'!'age

nmnber, or probable number. If the relath-e term to whiel1 the average numheiи refers is one of those relatiYes which are formed hy adding a comma to the symbol for au absolute term, as m, then the relatirn number is called apiиobability. For exampltи, [m,] is the a\-en1ge 1mmbcr of men

that anything is, but it is usually called the probabilit.v that anything is a man. The importance of average numbers arises from tlle fact that all our knowledge reall,\ conRists of nothing but aYerage nurn bers; for all our knowledge is derivetl from induction, and its analogu<', hypothesis. Now, the scientific conduct of this kiuu of reasoning is highly complex, because all so.rts of precautions have to be attended to, and it has to be accompanied by a great deal of deduction. But the general nature of induction is everywbere the same, and is complete]~и t~иpified in the following example. From a bag of mixed black and white beaus I take out a hamlful, aud count the number of l1lack and the nnmuer of whitP heans, and I assume tl1at t11e black and white are nearly in the same ratio throughout the bag. If I am in error in this conclusion, it is au errm" which a repetition of the same process must tend to rectif.,-, It is, therefore, a valid inference. But it clearly teaches me nothing in reference to the color of any particular bean, Of tltat I am as ignorant as before. The case is not in the least altered if I find all the beans of my hamlful to be black, or all to be white. I can still infer only the approximate general ratio, antl it is only this I express when I say the obsenation makes the probability of any oue bean being white or beingи black ,1ery great; for a probability is itself only an average number. At first thought it is hard to admit this; but the difficulty will be in great measure removed if we consider how it is that the knowledge of average numbers becomes useful in particular cases. 8uppose we know the relative numher of black beans in a certain bag; then, if we draw a large number of beans out of it, we know that the total number of black beaus we sliall uraw will be e<!lrnl to the number of drawings multiplied b;y the average number of beans in tlie bag. Suppose we know the relative numbers of black beans in a large number of bagg, containing different proportions; then, if the beaus are well mixed up in each, we may only draw tt single bean f'rmp each, and yet we can predict n<'arly the total number of Llack beans which would be drawn b~и simply taking the sum of the relatirn numbers. If the black beaus had a value while the white ones were worthlesR, then the total uumber of JJlack beans wl1ieh would he drawn would br. the im1)ortant tl1ing to kno"ии 13ut as knowledge derives its practical importance from its influence upon our conduct~ let us snppose that at every drawing we have our choice between two bags to draw from; then the man who knew the relative number of black beans in every l..Jag would act in e,иcry case as though the bean be woultl draw from the bag which contained the larger proportion of black ones were known to he black, atid as though the bean he woulu draw from the other were certainly white- Strictly speaking, he would know nothing about the beans that would he drawn in the particular case, but he would have a knowledge which would be so far equivalent to that that it woulu influence his eomluct in

the particular case. This is the only knowledge we ever have., a knowledge of what assumption to make in the particular case in order to do the best in the long run. 'Vhenever, then, we ha>e to do with a value, tlie sam-t-0tal of whicb in the Jong ran is the only thing which concerns \1s, the average amount of it is important to be known; lmt in all other cases the a>"erage numbers arn of no consequence. It i11 evident tlrn.t in the example just giYen it \nmld be a valna \Jlp, increase -0f knowledge to know, for instance, what the difference in the relatiYc number of black beans at the top and bottom of a bag was, and any limitation of the" universe" used which should separate a relative nurnbPr into two different ones vrnuld be advantageous. There are ruauy problems in probabilities, which, being soh-ed, girn a relath-e number composed of two terms, one known and the other nulrnown. Such an indeterminate result sbows that a wider" universe" must be adopted for one of the t.erms of the relative number. The fundamental arithmetical foTmulm relating to relatiYe numbers are as follows: \Ye have seen that the relative number of things that arc men, or the prnbabilit;r that a thing is a man, is e(]Ual to

[[i /] .

ny

"thing" here is meant any object of our limited uni>crse, as,

for example, an animal. But we may wish to consider .the relative number of animals that are men when our limited universe is a wider clm1s than animal. In this case, a. denoting an animal, we write this probabilit.y [ l~

t].

Let us

suppos~

that, our uniYerse being "day," we wish to know

the probability that if it thunders on any day it will rain on that day. To say that if it thunders it will rain on the same day is the same as to say that eYery day on which it thunders is a day on which it rains. Then let t be a day on which it thunders all(1 r a day on which it rains, and the probability in question is

l t[tJ l.

In general, the probability that if one eYent happens another

will happen is equal to the probabiJity that both will happen, diYided hy the probability that the first will happen. Let us now see how to express the probability that a certain quantity will have a certain value. It is clearly implied that the quantit;y is defined in some other way than by its value. It и might be, for instance, the length of time a bird will be on wing. Let x be tbis quantity, and let n

be auy definite value.

Then [ l~l

l, or the number of cases in "иhich the time a bird is flying has

that value, divided by the whole number of cases of a bird's flying, is the probability that a bird will fly for that length of time. But since time is continuous, the length of time a bird may be up may have an infinite number of different values. Consequently, the probability of any one is zt.'TO. vVe, therefore, seek the probability that the time lies between n and n + 6 n; and if 6 n is infinitesimal, (say d n,) then the probability is proportional to d n. "We may, therefore, write this probability thus, [nx ] d n. Here nx denotes the case of the value of x being about n. The probability that if one quantity, x, bas a value lying between m and m + d m, then another quantity, y, has a value lying between n and n + d n, will, according to what bas been said, be equal to the probability that both x and y will have the supposed values, divided by the probability that xwill have the supposed value, or will he [m

The special form of the fuuetion er is called the law of the facility of the errors. Except so far as this law is known, an observation can afford us no information whatever. The following conllitions are inrnriably fulfilled by this function. (It must be understood that only rcnl quantities are considered.) 1.

is half the probable value of the square of this error, and so on. The probable value of the error is often less than the probable rnlue of its square, owing to positiYe and negative errors balancing. But the co-efficients which involYe the cube and higher powers of the error may often become insignificant. Tllis, for example, will be the case if n is very great; for then, in comparison with the sum of all the errors, tlrn value of any one will be Yery small. In fact, in tllis case we ma;\- ll('glcct a 'luantity a certain number of times, say 1ll, larger tlrnu what we coultl nPglect hefore, an<l may take a unit of measurement M times larger. Tlicn if-

Uouseqnently if l\I is sufficientl_y large, the higher co-efficients may be neglt>cted. It also frequently happens that the error of each obse1Tation is line to the combined effect of a great number of independent or nearly independent causes, each one of which alone would produce but au iusiguificant effect. In this case, by the same reasoning the higher co-efficients will disappear. The manner in which sensation au<l Yolition are propagated through the nerve.sis unknown. but it must be b;\и some Yer~и complicated process, because it is Yery slow compared with the 1иate. of propagation of sound. [tis, therefore, probable that there may be .-ariatious of the rate of passage, aud that the Yclocity through each small portion of the whole lengU1 of tl1e 1wrnи is to some extent independent of the velocity through the other parts. If this iR so, the wliole time of propagation would be su~ject to a va.riation, the probable values of whose cube and higher powers would he иinsignificant. However this may be, it appears to be a fact that in all carefully-made obserYations, the error of which is due to the ine,itable inaccurac~и of the action of the human nerrns, the iirobable yalues of the culJe, &c., of the errors are very small. \Vhenever these quantities disappear it can be proved by au aual_y!ical proce,;s whicli neetl uot be reproduced here that-

where hand E are quantities which t:lepeml upon x. We thus reach the fundamental formula of the method of least squares. It is not the object of this paper to explain that method itself. Only it may be remarked that in the deduction of it which is usuall_y given, it is assumed that what we wish to obtain from observations in any case (wbetlier the method of least squares is applicable or not) is the most probable value of the unknown quantity. This is not the case, for there is but an infinitesimal probability in favor of any one value. Suppose that the cause of error in obserYing the place of a star were a nearly simple oscillation of the image about its mean point. Then the most probable errors would be tlte extreme ones. But we should much prefer to assume as the Yalue the probable or mean value than the most probable value, which would be removed the furthest possible from that value. The conception of the matter is this. '\\'hat observation has to teach us is a function, ,,, (e, ;-), not a mere number. Bnt in cases to which the method of least squares is applicable, this function is completely determined by two numbers, which are the value of the unknown quantity deri\eu from the application of that method and the value of its probable error.* It is assumed in treatises on least squares that fJJ~. M, or the probability (without regard to the value of the unknown quantity) that the quantity observed will have a value between t; and t; + d~, is equal to dt;. иwhen this is not the case it is only ncccssars to weight each observation by dividing by !Pt;.
" The term probable error is here used in its usual but unanalogical sense, and not for the probablll value of the error, which is always assumed to be zero in least squares, or else determined by some special research.

REPOUT OF THE SUPElU.NTENDENT O.F

If the probability of error .does not follow that law which the method of least squa,res supposes, that is to say, if the probability of the error x: in the mean of a large number of observations

is not equal to

Ja 6-иh' xи,

where his a constant imlepemlent of x, then it must at least be of this

form if h be considered to be a function of x. Now, h 2 is the weight which has to be assigned to au observation in the application of the method of least squares; and therefore when this metl10d uoes not apply in its unmodified form, it is only necessary to finu what function of x, h must be in order to ghиe tlie rer1uiretl law of facility of errors, arnl then proceed acemding tu the method of least squares, after having weighted each obsenиation by h 2 и Let the equation which represents -, the facility of error be plotted, the error being taken as abcis&m, and the probauility of that error as ordinate; then plot on the same diagram tbe curn y

= ~lo 6-x'.

Let ns suppose, then,

that a certain >alue of x, y, is A times as great for the actual curve of en-ors as it is for the normal least-squares curve. Now, if h be increased in the ratio A, the ordinates will be iucreased in this same ratio, and the abcissm will be diminished in the inYerse ratio so that the area of the curve is preserved. But if the onlinates at an:y one point arc to be increased in the ratio A, then the abcisRre at that point must be contracted in the itn-crsc ratio, so as to preserve the area; so that

assigned to any such obserYation in applying the method of least squares. It will he ouserved that since the weight depeuds on tlie va.Iue of the error, it will be neeessary first to mnke an approximate solution of the problem in order to get an approximate \'<tlue of the error from which to clctermine the weiglit, so that when the method of least 8quares iH not applica hie in its unmotlified form, an approximate method must necessarily be resorted to. Let us now proceed to consicler the method of ascertaioi11g the law of facility of erroL Iu any case, 'if the error is compounded of an infinite number of infiuitely small errors, or approximates to being so, then the law of facility of errors is of that general form which the method of least squares prescribes, and nothing remains intletermiuate excepting the value of h. Observation has sufficiently shown that in transit-observations the law of error is of this sort. I copy, for example, from Chauvenet's Astronomy the following table, taken from Bessel's" Fuudamenta Astrouorniru," showing the errors made by Bradley in ouserying Sirius aud Procyon :

relative weights of two masses, aucl he finds that if Y I.Jc the energ,y of the force which produces the excitation of any nerve, then if log v be considered as the observed quantity, the errors of the ol.Jserved quantity wi11 follow the law of least squares. Strictly speaking, the law of least squares recognizes the possibility of any error positive or negatiYe, however great, although the probability of indefinitely great errors \Till be iuclefiuitefy small. It occurred to me that in the case of the emersion of a star from an occnltation, siuce it was impossible to strike the chronograph-key too early, while it might be struck imlefmitely too fate, the law of least squares could hardly apply, and I have made some experiments upon this point, whieh I will narrate in detail at the end of this paper, merely remarking in this plaee that tlrn diyergem:11 from tile theoretical law proved to be insignificant. On tlic other hand, there arc many cases in which we have no reason to expect that the errors will~Yary accordiug to tlte least-squares curYe. Let us consiller, for example, a chemical analyAis. Here tlte error iR generally not due to the combine\1 action of a yery great number of very small causes, but, on the contrary, there are generally two or three lca\ling causes of error, depeniling upon some defect in the theory of the analysis or on some error in the manipulation, which is likel;y to result from a single one, such as cannot be regarded as in any way compmmded of a large number of irn1epBm1tmt parts. Tlms, a drop may be spilled or a portion thrown out of the crucible too sma!l to be detectetl, but the whole drop is spilled at once, or the whole portion goes at once. In Yery exact analysis, in which such causes are almost altogether eliminated, the remaining aml chief cause of enor will be an error of weighing, due to a want of <lclicacy of the balance, and will be of the same uatnrf' a:-; an error of computation, due to the fact that the number of decimal places used has been limited. The method of considering such errors is treated by Dr. Bremiker, in the preface to his" Tabula J,ogarithmorum Sos. Decimalium," a work to which tlte attention of chemists ought to be drawn. "\Yhen the law of facility of errors cannot be deduced a priori from the com;ideration of tlte causes to wliich it is due, it large number of experimental obsernttions must be made upon a known qnantity in order to find iu what manner the errors vary, or the same series of obsenиations may I.Jc used l.Jotlt to determine what the value of the unknown quantity is and also what the law of the variation of errors is. Tilus, in the method of least squares, h is to be deterwined empirically, and the common way of doingи it is to use the actual observations by which the unknown quantity is determined to determine also the value of h. In doing this, it .should be remembered that a precise and trustworthy determination can only be obtained from a large number of obser\atiomi. This procedure amounts, in fact, to adding au additional unknown quantit_r, a very ob,иious fact, and yet one 1Yhicli is habitually overlooked. Encke, in his" Astrouomisches J ahrbuch '' for 1834, has ginn the most complete formulre that I ha.иe anywhere found for uetermining the Yalue of h, as well as its uncertainty. These formulm require correction on acc0tint of the circumstance just mentionecl. They should be as follows: \Vhen it is necessary to combine, hy least squares, observations of diil'eren t orders of precisiou, they are weighted proportionately to h 2и If we have two series of observations, one of which is as accurate as you please, and the other as inaccurate as you please, a better result than that which the most accurate series of measures gives can always be got by combining witb it the least accurate series, provided the proper weights are giиen to the two series. This proposition seems paradoxical, and is not admitted by many very compfltent heads, bnt I cannot see how the conclusion can possibly be e\иa<led. It does not depend at all upon any of the peculiar principles induced l.Jy the method of least squares, but rests on the fundamental axioms of probabilities. Indeed, it may conveniently be based directly upon the principles of logic itself. The least accurate series of measures offers certain facts, whiclt may be usetl as premises, and it cannot be that if tilose facts are properly used they leave us in greater ignorance than we were before. Additional facts must increase our knowledge, if the proper inferences are made from them, and, therefore, an additional series of observations, if it have any weight at all, must, if its proper weight be assigned to it, improve the value of the unknown quantit,r. On the other hand, when it is considered that there is an uncertainty in the value of h, it may be that if the two series of observations differ greatly in oocuracy, and the value of his not dt1termined with much precision, it may be better at once to take the result of the best series of obserrntions than to combine the two series with the best weights that we are able to giw.

down again. Fis the magnet end of this repeater; B, the end at the second circuit. 'Vhen the first circuit is broken the armature flies up and instantly breaks the second circuit. II is arranged differently from common repeaters. As long as there is a current through the first circuit and the armature is held down, there is no connection in the second circuit. иwhen the first circuit is broken, the armatme, under the influence of a very strong spring, flies up for a dir-tance of a tenth of a millimeter, and there makes the connection in the second circuit. This repeatkir cm1 be extemporized ont of a common rela,y. The resistance-coil slwuld al wa_}'S Le used in connection with the chronoscope in such a way that when the circuit is broken in the first place the current sliall be so weak as just to be able to hold the hands still, while when it is made again the current shall be so strong as to make the circuit as quickly as possible. ' Th~ rate as given hy the break-circuit chronometer did not agree with that found by the fallapparatus, aml indeed there was a slight tfo;crepaucy in the rate giYeu by the latter for different heights of fall. Professor J.E. OliYer suggested to me that this discrepancy was due to a retanlation of the instrumeut when the hands were geared iu, wllich took place somewhat gradually, and I found that this was the case, and that the ear conlJ detect ill at wlieu the hands were geared in, during tlle space of three-fonrths of a second, the note produced l1y the vibration of tlie recd was lowered about the sixth of a tone. The supposition that this took place uniformly sufficiently accounteJ for all the discrepancy, and this gaYe me two more instrumental constants, vi7.: the amount of retardation on gearing in the hands, and tile time during whieh tliat retardation was brought about. "\Yith this instrument as well as with the other chronometer I matlc a large number of experiments upon the time occnpictl in answering signals of various kinds, such as the emission of points upon paper from behind a screen, the appearance of induction-sparks from a ltuhmkorff coil, ilasiles of light thrown upon a screen, sudden changes from one magic-lantern flgurn to another, &c., the ge1wral result of which was to conlirm the facts already iu our possession, aHd which arc due to the researches of l:lirsch, Daumbusch, and others. But there was one series of experiments whicl1 deserves particular description. I employed a young man about eighteen years of ag0, who had had no preYious f'xperience whatever in obr-crvations, to answer a-signal consisting of a sharp sound like a rap, tlie airnwer being maile upon a telegraph-operator's key nicely adjusted. l<'ive hundred ohseryations were made on eyery week-day during a month, twenty-four day8' ohsen-ations in all. The results are given in the aecompanyiug tal11e 1 aml arc also shown upon plate No. 27. On this plate the ahscissai nиpresent the interyal of time between the signal and the answer as indicated on the Hipp chronoscopc, tlrn ordinates measure the number of obseryations, which were subject to a large amount of error. The curve h:rn, howernr, not been plotted directly.from the observations, but after they lmvc been smoothed off hy the addition of adjacent numbers in the table eight timeR OYer, so as to dimiuish the irregularities of the cunиc. 'l'hc smoother curve on the figures is a mean cun-e for every day drawn by e;ye so as to eliminate the irregularities entirely. It was found that after the first two or three days the cnrn'I differed yery little from that dcriYed from the theory of least squareR. It will be noticed. tbat on the first da,y, иwhen the observer was entirely inexperienced, the observations scattered to such an extent that 1 have been obliged to draw the cunиe upon a different scale from that adopted for the other days. It will also be seen tbat tile personal equation from tlie mean amount by which t]ie answer came too late rapidly decreased for the firRt fi'rn days, un~il it ivas about one seventh of a second, and that it. then gradually increased until the twelfth day, when it amountetl to about O.:.l:.! seconds. l~ut while the personal equation was thns first diminishing and afterward increasing, the probable error or range of errors was constantly decreasing after the twelfth day. There was some variation in the personal equation, but not much, but the ra11ge of errors continually decreased as long as the observations lasted, and so remarkably that for the twenty-fourth day tlie probable error docs not exceed one-eightieth of a second. I think that this clearly ilemonstratcs the value of such practice in training tlie nerves for observation, for it-can liardly be supposed that the best obscner has so small a range of error as this, and I would therefore recommend that transit-observers be kept in constant training b;y m<'nns of some observations of an artificial event which can be repeated with rapidity, so that RC\иeral hundred can be taken daily without great labor, and I do not think that it is essential that these observations should very closely imitate the transit of a star over wireR> inasmuch as it is the general condition of the nerves which it is important to keep in training more ~ban anything peculiar to this or that kind of observation.

REPORT ON THE ECLIPSE 01" THE sex ox THE ~.!"!Ii OF DECDIUEH, l".\70. BY BENJA).HX PEIRCE, LL.D., f'WPERINTENDENT l'NITED STATES COAST Sl'TIYEY. (From the Coast
Rnrnи~и

R<иport for lf\71.)

Certain astronomical phenomena of rare occurrence and high importance for the advancement of human knowledge have~ in all ch-ilizcd countries, since modern science has been cultivated, been tleemed matters of national importance. Among these are total eclipses of the sun; and for many sears it has been customary for the great nations to organize expcditione for the observation of them. The first total eclipse dsible in tllis couutry since the formatiou of the Go\иernment was that of June, 1806. This was accurately ouser\иed at se\иeral points, and a иaluable painting was made of it. \Ve were 11ot fayored with another until November 30, 1834, when the moon's shadow passed over the coutinent from northwest to southeast. This eclipse was obsenet1 hy IL T. Paine, esq., of Boston, at Beaufort, South Carolinfl. .A. third eclipse did not Yi sit our countIJ- until 1860; hence, at that time this wonderful phenomenon was for most American astronomers a matter of hearsay.*' The path of the eclipse of July 18, 1860, was from иwashington Territory to the northern shore of Labrador, and thence across the ocea11 to Spain. This eclipse was observed lly expeditions organized under the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, and the results are published in the report for that year. It was also observed by the astronomers of several go\иernments abroad, and was the first total eclipse which was photographed. In 1868 British, French, and German expeditions were fitted out for the obsenиation of a total eclipse iu India. 011 this occasion llrilliant discoveries were made in regard to the spectrum of certain rose-colored prominences seen about the sun at such times; and these discoveries have been increasing in interest ever since. In 1869 another total eclipse was visible in the United States. It was obsened by parties organized by the Coast Survey and other Government bureaus. The resnlti:l were of high importance. Photographs of . the whole corona were taken for the first time; the first observations were made upon the spectrum of the corona; the radial polarization of the corona was first obsmTed with care, while the former knowledge of the subject "иas ad rnnceu in eyery direction. The results of these two eclipses were of such importance in regard to one of the chief scientific problems of our time-the constitution of the sun-as to excite the profoundest interest tllrougl10ut the world. It was felt by everybody even casually interesteu in science that the eclipse of 18i0 afforded an opportunity for removing the last obscurity from the subject of tlie corona, such as ought not to be let slip, the more so as no otherи eclipse was expected to be obscr1ed during this century. t In accordance with these views the Hon. John .A. Bingham, of Ohio, introduced a joint resolution, which was approved by Congress and the Executive, authorizing the fitting out of au American expedition, such as were to be sent out by Germany, by France, liy Great Britain, by Italy, and hy Spain, to studs the phenomena of this eclipse. The late unhappy war preYented the first two nations from sparing any of their energy for thisи peacefol emulation, hut extenshиc preparations were made by all the others. The American and English parties were in co-operation, and afforded each other mutual aid. It is hoped that the good feeling thus engendered was not without influence beyond the circle of science. The observations of this eclipse had for their general result the trium1lhant Yindication of the American observations of the year before, the novelty of whicli had made them somewhat
и "Mr. G. P. Bond bad observed the eclipse of 1851 in Sweden. t Nevertheless, the British government has sent out parties to another eclipso in 1871, in India and Australia; and tltree American llStronomers have been invifotl, through the Snperintemlent of the Coast Sarvey, to join the expedition,

suspected iu Europe, as well as the establishment of the superior ac:mracy of the American)unar predictions. Some new features were observed ill the corona and in the chromosphere, and other observations were multiplied. This is, however, not the place for entering upon the details of scientific prouetlings, wllich will be given with all desirable fullness in the .Appendix. 'Vith a view of selecting localities where astronomical conditions, as well as those of the weather, might be expected to be favorable for observation, Mr. Charles S. Peirce proceeded to Europe in advance, under my direction, and after visiting Italy, Spain, and European Turkey, recommended the occupation of stations in Southern Spain and in Sicily. The country east of Italy, over which the track of the totality passed, had the sun too low for photographic purposes.:.co.nsidering the probable distribution along the line of totality of the European astronomers, I decided, finally, to dispatch two parties, one to be stationed in the >icinity of Jerez, in Spain, the other, under my immediate personal direction, to occupy positions on the Island of Sicily, in the neighborhood of Catania. In selecting obser>ers I aniled myself of such as had previous experience, which, in matters pertaining to solar eclipses, is of much importance, and whose former services in the special lines of duty assigned gave full assurance that no fact that could possibly be noted under the circumstances would be lost. The party organized for service in Sicily had tile threefold duty assigned of making measures of precision, including the determination of the geographical position and local time of contact, of getting photographic impressions of the >arious phases of the eclipse and of the corona, and of analyzing the corona by means of the polariscope and spectroscope. Accompanying phenomena were also to be recorded. To improYe as much as possible the chances of the weather the party was spread over as large an area as could conveniently be included, a precaution which proved of great value, as may be gathered from the account of the labors of the party. A most cordial co-operation with the party of British observers, seyeral members of which took position at Catania, was maintained throughout our stay. While in England and on the Continent, on my way to the place of observation, the opportunity was taken to procure additional instruments required for our purpose. The party is indebted to l\Ir. Wilding, om vice consul at Liverpool, and to Signor Cattaneo, Italian consul at that port, for affording facilities to pass our instruments through the Messina custom-house. Our thanks are especially due, for most effective assistance rendered in receiving-. storing, and forwarding our instruments and reshipping them to New York, to our consul, Mr. F. W. Behn, at Messina, and the ,-ice-consul, Mr. Augustus Peratoner, at Catania. We were indebted, also, to Professor Lorenzo Madden and Professor Orazio Silvestri, of Catania, for assistance, and to the municipal authorities for permission to nse the grounds occupied by the observers. The distribution of the party in the vicinity of Catania, and the nature of the results secured, will be briefly mentioned. Our principal station was in the garden of the Benedictine Convent of St. Nicola, in the western llart of the city, a position selected by Assistant Charles A. Schott, who determined, early in December, the latitude and longitude 1 and also the local time. L. M. Rutherford, esq., of New York, provided photogra1lhic apparatus for use, by rtfr. H. G. Fitz, optician, who was sent in charge of the equatorial, and was assisted by Mr. D. C. Chapman and l\fr, Burgess, photographers. For determining time and latitude Mr. Schott used the portable meridian-telescope, C. S. No. 9, all(l siderial chronometer, Kessels, 1287, which was rated at 'Vashington, and checked at London, Berlin, Munich, and Naples. For local-time comparisons the party is indebted to Dr. Forster, director or the Berlin obserrntory; to Dr. Lamont, director of the Munich observatory; and to Professor de Gasparis, director, and Mr. Fergola., assistant, of the observatory at Cape di Monte at Naples. Transits were recorded on five nights, and thirteen pairs of stars were observed for latitude; the longitude depends upon that of :Xaples and Munich. In order to secure accuracy, Mr. H. H. D. Peirce compared chronometer times at Syracuse with the party of obserYers from the United States Naval Obserrntor,Y, thus verifying the determination for longitmle of the respective stations. A numlJer of chronometers were in advance rated for the use of observers, and a small triangulation was made, uniting the eclipse stations in the garden with the triangulation by Dr. Peters and

Baron Waltershausen, who surve,Yed that vicinity previous to the year 1841. It is gratifying to note the very close accordance between the earlier astronomical determinations and those taken thirty years afterward. Time signals by heliotropes were sent and received b.r the observers at Catania, and at the Monte-Rossi station. l\Ir. Schott included, in his series of geographical positions, the three places occupied in the garden of the convent, two by the English party in charge of Mr. J. Norman Lockyer, and the other by l\lr. J. H. Lamи, of the Office of United States Weights and Measures, who, though fully prepared for spectroscopic obserrntions, was prevented by unfa>orable weather from recording special results. The photographic party secured forty-five negatives of the sun, seventeen during the eclipse aml before totality, and fourteen after it, at irregular intervals, taking adrnntage of breaks in the clouds. The direction of a parallel of declination was indicated by the image of a thread, so adjusted before the eclipse that a solar spot might be seen as moving along the thread during the transit. 1\lr. Fitz operated the equatorial and timed the pictures. An attempt was ma<le by means of an ordinary camera to secure an impression during the momentary appearance of a portion of the corona. The time of the first contact was noted by l\Ir. Schott, who was a11prised by a pistol fired by a member of the English party, (the report by preconcert,) indicating that l\Ir. I . ockyer had afready spectroscopically noted the approach of the moon's limb over the solar cluomosphere. The tlense clouds which came from the direction of Mount Etna, and to the west of it, defeated all attempts at observfag the times of the inner contacts and of the last contact. l\Ir. Schott, howeYer, saw, through a rift in the clouds, a llart of the corona, to the north"'tud and eastward of the sun's center, for about three seconds. It appeared in sharp outline nearly concentric with the moon's limb, of white silvetиy light, ex.tending, by estimation, to about one-third of the moon's radius. The light tint of orange-yellow usually accompanying total eclipses was seen about the southern and eastern horizon. The first contact or beginning of the eclipse, as predicted from data in the American J<:phenwri1-:, was only 3.9 seconds earlier than the time actually noted in observing at Catania. My own station was about three miles north of Catania, at the villa, of the ::\Iarquis di San Giuliano, whose obliging courtesy is a subject of grateful remembrance. There the weather was more favorable than at the city, and afforded a full yiew of the corona, the stud,r of which was made a special object. Mr. 0. S. Peirce obsenиed with a polariscope aml obtained good results. Mrs. C. S, Peirce was successful in drawing the corona, and distinctly recognized the dark rifts which ha>e become a subject of discussion, and which were photographell by )Ir. Brothers, of the British party, at another station. Farther north were stationetl Ilrevet Brigadier General H. L. Abbot, United States Engineers, ProfessOT Itoscoe, of England, and Signor Amerigo da Sehio, Dr. Vogel, of Berlin, and others. Their object was to obserrn tbe phenomena of the eclipse at the greatest }lOSи Rible height on the southern slope of Monnt Etna, for comparison with similar obsenиations taken at stations near the sea-leYel. It is much to be regretted that this party was overtaken b;y a snowstorm which obscured the sky, and obligell them to descend during the time of the eclipse. A few miles to the westward and north\Vanl of Catania, at one of the trigonometrical signals 011 the western peak of Monte Rossi, Dr. C. H.F. Peters, of llamilto11 College, Clinton, New York and Sub-Assistant иw. Eimbeck selected a position for ousening the eclipse. Dr. l'eters had a spec. troscope apparatus, and Mr. Eimbeck a comet-seeker. T!Jis iiarty also lrnd unfavorable weatlier, but succeeded in noting the times of ti.Jc first contact and of tlie last contact; the last through thick haze. The interior contacts were lost on account of a passing hail-st.-0rm. l\lr. Eimbeck also assisted Mr. Schott in recording transits and other obsermtions at Catania. Professor J. C. иwatson, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, occupied a station on tlic high. ground near Carlentini. The weather there was favorable during the time of totalit:)и Professor Wat>1011 made observations, which resulted in two colored drawings of the corona of unri\иaled fullness of detail and accuracy. Dr. T. \Y. Parsons, at Syracuse, also made an elaborate colore<l representation of the eclipse. It will tlms he seen that my party in Sicily were distributed to the north of the track of total eclipse, while stations to the south of it were occupied by the party from the United States Na.ml Observatory. Stations on the central line were occupied by the Italian astronomers, inclnding the Padre Secchi, Professor Cacciatore, aml others.

lrnPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

A detailed account of the results of observations will be found in the Appemlix No. 16 of the report of 1870. I take this opportunity to mention the kindness of Henry Suter, esq., Her Britannic Majesty's vice-consul at Larissa and Volo, who, when it was contemplated to send a party to Larissa, afforded every facility for the prosecution of inquiries, and was in readiness to assist further if it had been expedient to occupy a station near that city.
