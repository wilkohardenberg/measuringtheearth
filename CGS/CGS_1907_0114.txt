REPORT bF. THE SUPERINTENDENT.
THE .WORK OF THE YEAR.

The most unusual feature of the work of the year was the investigation of the effect of the San .Francisco earthquake of April, 1906, on the triangulation covering the region in the vicinity of the great "fault" which shows on the surface of the earth from Point Arena to Monterey Bay, a distance of more than 320 kilometers (200 miles). Fortunately, this region had been covered by triangulation of a high degree of precision in the progress of the work intrusted by law to the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and there ar.e numerous points within the region whose coordinates were determined by this triangulation. There was reason to believe that the relative positions of many of these points had been changed by a measurable amount, and it was decided to repeat as much of the triangulation as proved to be necessary to determine what changes had occurred. Astronomic azimuths were determined and many of the triangulation stations were reoccupied and the horizontal angles were remeasured in order to compute new geographic 'positions of points within the region. The direct comparison of the. coordinates obtained in the old and in the new work shows the movement of any point selected in latitude, in longitude, and in azimuth, referred to adjacent points. The work extends from the region of no disturbance on the east southward to Monterey Bay and northward to Point Arena. The investigation was completed before the end of the year, and the amount of displacement determined agrees in a general way with the measurements made by the California Earthquake Commission at certain places on roads and along fences where such measurements were possible. One of the international observatories for the determination of latitude is located at Ukiah, 30 miles east of Point Arena, and the observations there show that at this point there was no movement in latitude or it was too small to be measured. Leveling operations were also undertaken and completed in the vicinity of San Francisco to ascertain whether any movement affecting the Survey bench marks could be detected as a result of the earthquake. A full discussion of the results obtained in this investigation has been made and is published as Appendix 3 to this report. The conclusions reached in this investigation may be stated as follows: During an earthquake in 1868, or; about that time, about I ooo square miles of the earth's crust in the region immediately n~rth of San Francisco were permanently ?isplaced to the northward about i.6 meters (5.2 feet), and the indications are that this whole area moved as a block without distortion or rotation.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

During the earthquake of April 18, 1906, earth movements took place as follows: Points on opposite sides of the "fault" moved in opposite directions-those to the eastward of the fault in a southerly direction and those to the westward in a northerly direction. The displacements of all points were approximately parallel to the fault. The displacements on both sides of the fault decrease in amount as the distance from the fault increases. Points on the western side of the fault were displaced, on an average, about twice as much as corresponding points at equal distances on the eastern side. A small area, including portions of San Francisco, both sides of the Golden Gate, and Sausalito, 1t miles north of the Golden Gate, where bench marks had been established and tide observations were in progress, was investigated, and the general conclusion was reached from both leveling and tide observations that within the region examined there occurred no general change of elevation of sufficient magnitude to be detected with certainty. In this connection it is interesting to know that certain displacements were developed many years ago by results of triangulation obtained at differerit dates, and that Prof. George Davidson, then an officer of the Survey, advanced the theory that earth movements had occurred as the result of an earthquake; but at that time there was not sufficient evidence to sustain his theory. · Portions of the work involved in opening and remonumenting the boundary line between the United States and Canada, along the forty-ninth parallel, west of the Rocky Mountains, had been completed and others were being continued at the date of my last annual report. Good progress was made, and the work is almost completed. The final inspection of the completed portion of the line and the placing of numbers on the monuments is in progress under the joint direction of the commissioners. The examination of the boundary between the United States and Canada, north of the State of Vermont, was completed and the work of opening and remonumenting the line is in progress under the joint direction of commissioners representing the United States and Great Britain. This work was completed for 50 miles of the line during the year. Satisfactory progress was made in the demarcation of the Alaska-Canada boundary in southeastern Alaska and the work of locating the line, opening the vista along the line, and erecting monuments was being continued at the date of this report. A point on the one hundred and forty-first meridian of west longitude was ascertained, on the Alaska boundary near the Yukon River, as provided in the convention between the United States and Great Britain (signed April 21, 19o6), by commissioners representing the two Governments, and the work of tracing and marking the boundary is in progress under the joint direction of the commissioners. The Fifteenth General Conference of the International Geodetic Association "was held at Budapest, Hungary, September 20 to 28, 19o6. The Superintendent and another officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey attended its sessions,' representing the United States as delegates. The convention under which this international association exists was formally renewed for a period of ten years and other business of importance was transacted. Work at the latitude observatories at.Gaithersburg, Md., and at Ukiah, Cal., maintained by the International Geodetic Association under my direction, was continued during the year.

An officer of the Survey continued on duty as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, as required by law, and devoted as much of his time as necessary to the work of the Commission. This officer has been appointed by the Secretary of \Var as a member of the board to examine and report on a 14-foot channel in the Mississippi River from St. Louis to its mouth. As provided by law, an officer of the Survey was detailed to cooperate with.the Maryland State Board of Shell Fish Commissioners in making a survey of and locating the natural oyster beds, bars, and rocks in the waters within the State of Maryland. During the year the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey representative was completed for the waters of Anne Arundel County and a report and maps were prepared and published. The work is being continued in other waters of the State. In response to a request from the.Naval Board, Jamestown Exposition, several special surveys and hydrographic examinations were made in Hampton Roads and vicinity, and a special anchorage chart was prepared and published showing the anchorages selected for the vessels of United States and foreign navies visiting the Exposition. The triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian was extended in Minnesota from the vicinity of Fergus Falls to the Stephen Base. One base line was measured in :\finnesota in connection with this triangulation. The primary triangulation along the Pacific coast in Oregon and Washington was completed and the necessary connections of the Tertiary triangulation along the coast with the primary work in the interior were undertaken and two such connections were made. The triangulation of the City of New York by the corporation under the direction of the Coast and Geodetic Survey made satisfactory progress during the fiscal year. A?tronomic observations to determine latitude, longitude, or azimuth were made in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. The standard levels were extended in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, and Utah. Hydrographic examinations were made to safeguard navigation in localities where they were necessary along the coasts of Maine, Massachusetts,· Rhode Island, and New York. East Penobscot Bay, Eggemoggin Reach, and Jericho Bay on the coast of Maine and certain channels in the vicinity of Key West, Fla., were examined·with the long wire drag. This drag, which is described in my Annual Report for 1905, has proved to be an important advance in the work of safeguarding vessels of all classes, as it detects all dangers to navigation above the depth at which the drag is used. Hydrographic work was done on the inside of the entrance to Chesapeake Bay and along the Virginia shore, between New Point Light and Back River Light, off the entrance to York River. The offshore hydrographic work was continued and practically completed to the eastward of Vieques Island, Porto Rico, and in that vicinity, and the offshore hydrography off the north coast of the island of Porto Rico was extended westward from Cape San Juan. The topographic resurvey of the shores of the Potomac River was completed, topographic work was continued along the shores of Chesapeake Bay, and a survey was made of Fishermans Island, Quarantine Station, as requested by the Treasury Department.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

The magnetic survey of the country was continued by making observations in Alabama, Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Idaho, Indian Territory, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, Rhode Is1and, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. Continuous observations were obtained at magnetic observatories maintained at Cheltenham, Md.; Baldwin, Kans.; Sitka, Alaska; Honolulu, Hawaii; and Vieques, P.R. Magnetic observations were made in the Atiantic and Pacific oceans on board the vessels of the Survey on their voyages to and from their fieids of work. On one voyage from Norfolk to Seattle via Cape Horn a very valuable series of observations was made both on land and at sea. Self-registering tide gauges were maintained at the following stations: Fort Hamilton, N. Y.; Philadelphict, Pa.; Baltimore, Md.; Fernandina, Fla.; Weeks, La.; Galveston, Tex.; San Diego, Cal.; Presidio, Cal.; Seattle, Wash.; Honolulu, Hawaii; and Manila and lloilo , P. I. The tide indicators at Fort Hamilton, N. Y.; Reedy Island, Delaware River, Delaware; and Alcatraz Island, San Francisco Bay, California, have been continued, and the electric tide indicators in the rooms of the Maritime Association of New York and in the Bourse Building in Philadelphia have given satisfaction. The information necessary for the revision of the United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VI, was collected in the field.
ALASKA.

Jn Alaska, surveys, including triangulation, topography, and hydrography, were made in the following localities, viz, Khaz Bay and adjacent waters; Ketchikan; Warren Cove; Latouche Passage and Dries Bay, Prince William Sound; Alitak Bay and Sitkinak Strait; St. Paul Harbor, Kodiak Island; Anchorage Bay, opposite the Semidi Islands; Usnika Passage; Port Chatham; and Iliamna Bay. The demand for surveys in Alaska is pressing; and during the year one of the surveying vessels was transferred from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast as an addition to the force engaged in extending the surveys along the Alaskan coast. Information was collected in the field for a revised edition of the Alaska Coast Pilot, Part 1, and for a publication to cover the coast from Yakutat Bay to Kodiak Island. Reference has already been made to the demarkation of the Alaska Boundary and to the work at the magnetic observatory at Sitka.
PHll,IPPIN£ ISi.ANDS ·.

Rapid progress in the important work of charting the waters of the Archipelago was made during the year. The surveying parties were kept in the field almost continuously, and advantage was taken of the varying weather conditions in different localities to secure a large amount of work. The results of the field work were promptly made available in the form of drawings for charts and transmitted to Washington for review and publication. ·

Some details of the work accomplished may be stated as follows: West coast of Luzon.-Offshore hydrographic work was done between Balingasay Point and Caiman Point, and between Guai Point and Capones Islands, this completing the general survey of the west coast of Luzon from Calili Point to the vicinity of Laguimanoc Bay, except for a portion about 5 miles in length south of the Frailes Islands. The triangulation was extended southward between Luzon, Mindoro, and Marinduque, and from the vicinity of Manila to Caballo Island at the entrance to Manila Bay. Verde Island Passage.-The hydrographic survey of this passage was completed. South and east coast of Luzon.-A reported danger to navigation at the entrance to Port Cubat was located, and work was done fo complete the survey of Port Sula. East coast of Luzon.-One party made a general survey of the coast from Maqueda Channel to San ~1iguel Bay, and an important and valuable harbor of refuge in typhoons was discovered in the Lamit Islands. Another party completed the survey westward from San Miguel Bay to Jesus Point, and still another made surveys between Alabat Island and the west coast of Polillo Island. Extensive changes in the general coast as shown on existing charts will result from this work. Another valuable harbor of refuge in typhoons in Polillo Island was surveyed, and a survey was made of Port Lampon and Burdens Bay, the latter giving access to the coal deposits on Polillo Island. A dangerous shoal off Cabugao, south coast of Cantanduanes Island, was located and surveyed. North and east coasts of Samar.-The survey of this coast was extended. from Laoang to the Balicuatro Islands, where it joins the work already completed iu this region. Surveys were made in Matarinao Bay, between Bacan Islands and Alugon Bay and from Paninihian Point to Matarinao Bay except for a space of 5 miles a short distance south of Llorente. The surveys of all harbors suitable for commerce or refuge on the north and east coasts of Samar have been completed. Guimaras Straits, east ~oast of Panay, and north coast" of Negros.-The survey was extended from Tomonton Point, Negros and Banate, Panay, northward to Rogalumbi Island, and the triangulation, to a connection with th0 Zapatos Islands and Jintotolo Light, and east to Don Islands. South and west coasts of Panay.-The hydrography of these shores from Olon to San Jose de Buena Vista was completed. Triangulation was also done on the west coast, and the topographic work was extended to Bugan River. West coast of Leyte.-The triangulation was extended from Bulalagui Point, Cebu, to Limasana Island, south of Leyte. The topographic work was completed south to Hindang, and the Comote and Quatro Islands were surveyed. The hydrography was completed from Donajon Banks to Palompon and the general survey from Bacacay Point to Liloan Bay. North coast of Mindanao.-A survey was made in Iligan Bay, which connects the work previously done in the vicinity of Iligan with Polo Point, and covers the location and development of Iligan Reef. South coast of Mindanao.-The survey of this coast was resumed in the vicinity of Zamboanga, and the triangulation was extended to the head of Sibuguey Bay; the topographic work was done between Masingloc Anchorage and Buluan Island, and the hydrography was completed to the parallel of Baguilibid Point, within 10 miles of the east coast of the bay.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

The survey of the Gulf of Davao was continued and much progress was made. Tide observations were made in connection with all hydrographic work, and continuous observations were obtained at Manila and at Iloilo. As much as possible of the work of preparing the results for the use of mariners and others is done at the suboffice at Manila in order to aid in its prompt publication by chart and otherwise. Twenty-two drawings for charts were prepared and forwarded to Washington for printing. Eight of these were for new charts, 9 were drawings for new editions, and s were drawings with extensive corrections. Eleven notices to mariners and a new edition of section 111 of the Sailing Directions were prepared and published. Details of field operations are giYen in "Appendix 1.

O~'FICE

WORK.

In the Office the current work was kept up to date, and satisfactory progress was made in the various branches of the work, including computation, plotting, and discussion of results of field work and the preparation of the data for publication by chart or otherwise. Constant proof of the usefulness of the work of the Bureau is afforded by the continued increase in the number of requests for data from the archives of the Survey. All such data suitable for publication arc being prepared as rapidly as possible for distribution in printed form. The computation of heights from the leveling observations and the reduction of astronomic observations were made as the records were received, and this work is practically up to date. The computation necessary to reduce the measurement of base lines made during this and the preceding fiscal year was completed, and the results of this work are published as Appendix 4 to this report. An investigation of the figure of the earth, based on existing geodetic work in the United States, was completed, and a report on the subject was presented to the International Geodetic Association by the delegates from the United States to the Fifteenth General Conference of the Association at Budapest, Hungary, in September,
l9o6.

The results of magnetic observations made on land and at sea during the year have b~en revised and prepared for publication as Appendix 5 to this report. Good progress has been made in the reduction of the records of the magnetic observatories · in the endeavor to prepare for early publication the results for the three years 1902-4. The reduction of the vertical intensity observations made at Cheltenham during certain specified hours in 1902-3 was finished, and the results have been transmitted to the German Government, thus completing the data called for in cooperation with the German Antarctic Expedition of 1902-3. In response to requests from magneticians abroad, data have been furnished from time to time to be used in special investigations of terrestrial magnetism and allied phenomena. The compilation of earthquake data obtained from the seismographs at Honolulu, Cheltenham, and Vieques has been completed to the end of 1906. New tables, showing the secular change of the magnetic declination, and a new isogonic chart of the United States, for 1905, were prepared and published as Appendix No. 4 of my report for 1906. A revision of this chart, based on the observations made by this Bureau and the Department of Terrestrial .Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution during the past fiscal year, has been completed, and progress has been made in the preparation of isoclinic and isodynamic charts for January l, 1905.

Tide Tables containing the predicted tides for numerous ports on the coast of the United States and i!J foreign countries for the year 1908 were prepared for publication. Copies of the predicted tides for Astoria, Oreg., and Sitka, Alaska, were furnished in advance of publication to the Canadian government in response to a request from the authorities, and similar information relating to Wellington and Auckland, New Zealand, was furnished to the New Zealand authorities upon request. Twenty drawings for charts were completed for reproduction by photolithography, 1 2 of these being for new charts. Five new copper plates were engraved, 8 were etched, 65 were extensively corrected, and minor corrections were made on 793. One hundred and twenty-two thousand charts were printed for sale and distribution. Details of Office operations are given in Appendix 2. The Annual Report of the Survey to Congress for 1906 was prepared for printing and sent to the printer on September 1, 1906, and it was available for distribution on December 1, 1906. The results of the magnetic observations made during the year were published as an appendix to the report with an isogonic chart of the United States showing the conditions existing on January l, 1905. The amount appropriated for the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year 1907 (June 30, 1906) was. $848 915 (exclusive of the appropriation for printing), of which $210 245 was for manning and equipping the vessels of the Survey, $30 ooo for repairs and maintenance of vessels, and $50 ooo for Office expenses. The remainder of the appropriation was divided between expenses of parties in the field ($257 900) and salaries of field and office forces ($300 770). In addition to the above sums, the appropriations for marking the United States and Canada boundary and for locating and marking the Alaska boundary, made to be expended by the Secretary of State, are disbursed under my direction as Commissioner by the Disbursing Agent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey as special disbursing officer for the Department of State.

Repairs were made to the vessel by the crew before leaving Orea. The steamers Pathfinder, Fathomer, Marinduque, Research, and Romhlon were at work during the year in the Philippine Islands, and the account of their work is given in connection with the report of progress in the survey of the Islands. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR OF GEODETIC WORK.

J. F. HAYFORD, Inspector. The duties of the Inspector were performed at the Office in Washington, where the records of parties at work in the field were examined as they were received from the field, and an effective supervision over the work was maintained in this way. The most important event of the year was the completion of the primary triangulation northward along the Pacific coast to a connection with the Puget Sound triangulation in the vicinity of Tacoma. The United States Standard Datum can now be extended from central California through this triangulation to the work along the Columbia River and Puget Sound, and through a connection at Semiahmoo Bay to the forty-ninth parallel triangulation and along this international boundary to Montana. This primary work has been conn'ected with the coast triangulation at two places in Oregon and other connections are in progress. · The work just completed was done in a region where it was formerly supposed that the progress would be slow and the cost excessive, but the work was done with remarkable rapidity and at a very small cost, comparatively. A field party completed the measurement of a series of six primary base lines in the States of Texas, Oregon, Washington, South Dakota, and Minnesota. These base measurements mark a new epoch in the history of this class of work. The cost per kilometer was 25 per cent less than the cost of similar work previously done by the Survey, and demonstrated that base measurements of the required degree of accuracy can be made rapidly and economically in daylight with invar tapes. By the use of these tapes the cost of base measurement can be still further reduced.

facilities of the observatory at Cheltenham for standardizing magnetic instruments were used during the year by the Department of Research in Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington; by the United States Weather Bureau; by Doctor Angenheister, of the Samoan (German) Observatory. A record of nearly 100 earthquakes was made by the seismograph at the Honolulu Observatory. At Sitka a comparison was made between the observatory instruments and those of Capt. R. Amundsen, used in his magnetic work in North America. New buildings were erected for the Porto Rico Observatory, and the instruments were moved from their old location to these new buildings.
MAGNETIC WORK ON LAND.

The magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were determined at 287 stations distributed over 38 States and Territories, including Porto Rico and the Philippine Islands, as summarized in the following table:

A very important series of observations was made on board the Explorer while on her way from Baltimore, '.\1d., to San Diego, Cal., by way of the Straits of Magellan. The observations obtained in the equatorial regions of the Pacific Ocean arc especially valuable as contributions to the knowledge of the magnetic elements in this locality. The steamer Bache, on her way to Porto Rico and return, followed courses inside and outside the usual route in order to make observations in regions where no observations had been made. :\fore observations were obtained at sea than during any previous year. OFFICE OF DISBURSING AGENT.
ScoTT :-.IESBIT,

JJisbursi11g Agent.

The Disbursing Office of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has charge of all of the appropriations made for that service and, in addition, the appropriations made to the State Department for the survey and marking of the boundary between the United States and Canada and of the boundary between Alaska and Canada. 'fhe extremely wide field of work covered by these appropriations compel payments to be made in all parts of the United States proper and in the most remote regions of the possessions under the jurisdiction of the United States, especially in Alaska, Porto Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippine Islands. The services of more than 70 bonded chiefs of party arc required to make these payments at the remote points occupied by the working parties of this Survey, both on land and sea. All of the public funds used by these officers are advanced from the central Disbursing Office of the Survey, and the resulting bookkeeping and auditing arc done in that office. Necessarily a very extensive line of correspondence results, as, in addition to all pay and salaries, the manning, equipping, outfitting, and repairing of the vessels of the Survey, the purchase and sale of clothing and small stores, the system of allotments made by seamen and other employees; and the entire expense of the field work of the service, which is both extensive and varied, and the survey and marking of the two boundary lines mentioned, are financed entirely from the central Disbursing Office. The above-mentioned chiefs of party arc bonded in the sums of from $2 ,ooo to $10,000 each, and while acting as chiefs of party these officers receive from time to time such advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent as are approved

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDEN'T.

by the Superintendent and are required to meet the necessary current expenses of the work in hand. A ledger account is kept in the office of the Disbursing Agent, with each chief of party receiving an advance made to him. and on the other hand receiving credit for all proper expenditures made by him, when presented on regularly supported vouchers after such accounts have been audited in the office of the Disbursing Agent, found to be correct, and approved by the Superintendent of the Survey. All of these accounts, after they have received the administrative examination required by Jaw in the office of the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, are, with their supporting vouchers, sent through the Departmti'!t of Commerce and Labor to the Auditor for the State and other Departments for examination and audit by him. This system has met the needs of this Survey and results, in the main, in economy and good order in its expenditures. A very large proportion of the appropriations named is now being expended in the survey of the most remote waters of Alaska and the Philippine Islands, and, in the survey and marking of the boundary between Alaska and Canada, far in the interior of that territory. An itemized statement of receipts and expenditures is submitted to Congress each year, as required by Jaw, and is printed as a Congressional document. OFFICE OF EDITOR OF PUBLICATIONS. The Annual Report of the Superintendent (pp. 1-230) covering the progress of the work of the Survey during the fiscal year 1906 was completed and sent to the Public Printer through the Secretary. of Commerce and Labor on September l, and the last proof was read and returned to the Printer on October 22. Copies of the Report were received for distribution on December l, 1906. The annual statement covering the work of the year was prepared and transmitted to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor. Numerous assignments to temporary duty were completed. The publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey arc given in the following list:

The tide gauge at the Presidio of San F.rancisco was connected by leveling with various bench marks in San Francisco and with those across the bay at Sausalito. This work involved 29 kilometers of leveling, and 26 old bench marks were recovered and used. The elevations of these bench marks were determined before the earthquake of April, I906, and these elevations were determined for the purpose of measuring any movement which remains as the effect of the earthquake. The results of this work are given in Appendix 3 of this Report, which treats of the earth movements.

Triangulation: 25

The triangulation in Minnesota in the vicinity of the ninety-eighth meridian was continued by Assistant Bowie from July 13 to October 13. A signal-building party was organized, and rapid progress was made in tqe erection of signals, so that there was no delay on this account. Observations were made to determine the horizontal and vertical angles at 25 triangulation stations, and the work was extended over a lineal distance of 146 miles, or from the vicinity of Fergus I<'alls to Stephen. Observations to determine an azimuth were made at two triangulation stations during the season. Signals were erected at all triangulation stations northward to the boundary line between the United States and Canada.

The work at the magnetic observatory at Cheltenham, .Md., was continued without interruption during the year. A continuous record of the relative force of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism was obtained. On the 1st and 15th of each month until February, in accordance with an international programme, one of the magnetographs was made to record at a rapid rate for a period of two hours. Observations were made once each week to determine the ~bsolute value of the magnetic forces. The seismograph was kept in operation during the year and a record of all earth tremors was obtained. The wireless telegraph receiving apparatus continued work in a satisfactory manner and was used in receiving time signals. In January and February an observer from the Weather Bureau visited the observatory, studied the methods of work, and standardized a set of instruments belonging to the Weather Bureau. In 1\fay Mr. Burbank visited the Weather Bureau Observatory at Mount Weather to make additional comparisons between the instruments used at the two observatories. The faci.lities for standardizing magnetic instruments were also used by members of Department of Research in Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. In June observations of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism were made at the stations named below under the direction of Mr. Burbank by observers detailed to work under his direction: In Indiana, at Brookville, Connersville, Newcastle, Richmond, and Winchester; in New York, at Auburn and Ithaca; and in Ohio, at Cincinnati and Marietta.

Advantage was taken of the presence of the observer in the various localities mentioned to have magnetic observations made at 24 stations distributed as follows: 3 in Alabama, I in Florida, 1 in Indian Territory, 4 in Kansas, 2 in Minnesota, 3 in Nebraska, ' in North Carolina, 1 in North Dakota, 2 in Oklahoma, 4 in South Dakota, 3 in t'ennessee, 2 in Texas, and 3 in Virginia. The observations were made to supply astronomic data along the ninety-eighth meridian and in certain other regions where additional astronomic observations were '1eeded for the proper discussion of the triangulation in those regions. The work was arranged in such order as would insure the most favorable weather c:onditions and the least amount of travel consistent with this requirement. Many of the observation stations were triangulation points on mountains, and considerable delay in this portio,n of the work resulted from difficulties of transportation and from unfavorable weather and the difficulty of using long lines in determining an azimuth at such stations. At nearly all the stations on mountains it was necessary to clear the lines used in determining azimuth, at both ends. Whenever it was necessary, the latitude station was connected with the triangulation, and in some cases additional stations were established and marked in making this connection. In response to a request from the Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds at Washington, the elevation of certain bench marks on the Washington :Monument were redetermined from other bench marks in the vicinity to form a portion of the record be:1ring on the stability of the structure.

(W. C. DIBRELL, Commanding, Steamer Explorer.] SUMMARY OP Rl>SULTS.-Hydrography: 20 square miles of area covered; 1 056 mile· of lines sounded; 45 849 soundings made; 7 tide stations occupied, and 4 hydrographic sheets completed. Magnetic observations: 15 stations occupied on land and 1 23 stations occupied at sea.

Hydrographic work along the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island was assigned to Assistant Dibrell, and he sailed from Baltimore on July 23. Magnetic observations were made on board the vessel in Hampton Roads, once en route to Newport, and in Narragansett Bay off the city. A hydrographic examination was made of the shoal area in Narragansett Bay just north of Dyer Island, and the rock on which the barge Ohio, drawing 14 feet, struck in 1905, was found and its position determined. A hydrographic resurvey was made of the Middle Ground in Vineyard Sound and of L'Hommedieu and Hedge Fence shoals in Nantucket Soupd. Hydrographic work was also done on Orion Shoal in the approach to Nantucket Sound. The progress of the work was greatly delayed by unfavorable weather. Magnetic observations were made on shore at Vineyard Haven and on board the vessel outside the harbor. On December 3 the vessel sailed for Baltimore and en route made examinations of Intrepid Rock in Fishers Island Sound, and of a small rock in Hart Island Roads. An unsuccessful search was made for a rock reported to be off Peacock Point near Oyster Bay, N. Y. Magnetic observations were made on shore at Stonington, Conn., on board the vessel in Fishers Island Sound, and near Falkner. Island and each day while the vessel was at sea en route to Baltimore, including observations in Lynnhaven Roads at the entrance to Chesapeake Bay and on shore in Baltimore. The vessel reached Baltimore on December 15, and the magnetic work was completed by making observations on shore. The steamer Explorer sailed from Baltimore on February 20, and on June 30 was off the coast of Mexico north of Magdalena Bay, Lower California, en route to Seattle, Wash., under orders to proceed to Alaska and take part in survey of the coast of that Territory. Advantage was taken of the ship's voyage to secure magnetic observations in the regions traversed, and those secured in the equatorial regions of the Pacific Ocean are especially valuable. The vessel proceeded from Callao to Panama by way of Chatham Island, Galapagos Islands, and magnetic observations were made on shore and at sea off the island.

The determination of the geographic position of Sabine Bank Light-house in the Gulf of Mexico was in progress on July 1, and Assistant Fairfield was at Sabine Pass Light-house on that date. The observations were finished the following day and on July 6 all the work in this vicinity was completed. The reoccupation of certain triangulation stations in California for the purpose of determining whether their relative positions were affected by the San Francisco earthquake of April, 1906, was assigned to Assistant Fairfield, and he reached Tomales Bay on August 11. Some preliminary work had been done before his arrival and five stations had been recovered. Three additional stations in the old triangulation were recovered, and some new stations were established. Horizontal angles were measured at these stations, and the work was completed on November 20, after great delay on account of fog and strong winds. The party was then moved to Redwood, Cal., and five triangulation stations in the vicinity of Pulgas Base Line were recovered and two new ones were established. Horizontal angles were measured at three of the primary triangulation stations, all of which were on mountains, and serious delay resulted from rain, fog, and snow and the impassable cond.ition of the roads at certain times. The-work was completed and the party was disbanded on May 31.

In response to a request from the Director of the Bureau of Standards, Assistant Ferguson was directed to make a topographic survey of the grounds of the Bureau and of the land in its immediate vicinity with sufficient detail for a map of the grounds on a large scale (40 ft.= 1 inch). The area was divided into squares with sides equal to 100 feet by using a theodolite, and the corners were marked. The elevations of these marks were determined bv leveling, and they were then used in the topographic survey with a plane table. The contour interval was fixed at 5 feet, and all topographic details were located. The work began on May 1 and was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. It was temporarily suspended from :\fay 26 to June 5.

The topographic resurvey of the south shore of the Potomac River was completed by Assistant Forney from Nomini Cliffs to Smiths Point, at the mouth of the river. This includes a survey of a portion of the shore line of Yeocomico and Coan rivers. The survey was extended inland to the high land overlooking the river, and·included the location of contours, roads, creeks, and all other topographic features. In the vicinity of Nomini Cliff the land reaches an elevation of 190 feet above mean high water, the highest point within the area surveyed. The banks of the rivers arc being eroded, and many of the old triangulation stations have disappeared. The position of the shore line on Gwynns Island and at the southern entrance to Milford Haven has changed very much, and both bank? of the Piankatank River between its mouth and Stove Point have receded.

Triangulation: 20 square miles of area covered; 4 stations occupied, and 31 geographic positions determined.

On July I base measurement was in progress in Minnesota under the direction of Assistant French. The work at the Royalton base line of the triangulation along the ninety_-eighth meridian was completed on July 11, and the party was disbanded on that date. At Royalton all the tapes used in measuring the base lines during the season were standardized on a 50-meter comparator, whose length was determined with the iced bar. A discussion of the work of the season and the results of the measurement of the base lines is published in appendix 4.

In connection with this work observations were made at four triangulation stations, and the geographic positions of numerous prominent objects, visible from Hampton Roads, were determined. The work in the vicinity of the exposition grounds covers the region from Tanners and Masons creeks to Sewall Point. A survey was also made of the water front from Newport News shipbuilding yard to the town of Hampton and extended inland to include the location of all streets and roads within the area shown on the published chart. In response to a request from the Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds in the District of Columbia, the position of a point near the Potomac River, on the prolongation of the line between the center of the dome of the Capitol and the Washington l\fonument, was determined and marked, and a survey was made of the area between the Washington Monument, B street south, and the Potomac River. In connection with this work the geographic positions of a number of obj~cts were determined.

The examination of channels and harbors with the long wire sweep was continued by a party under charge of Aid Heck. The work began in East Penobscot Bay at Great Spruce Head on August 3 and was extended to Devils Head in Eggemoggin Reach by October 4. After that date work with the sweep was begun in Jericho Bay and. was continued until November 6, when the work was stopped for the winter. Forty-two square miles of area were covered with the sweep and this involved passing over a linear dist~nce of 423 miles. In Eggemoggin Reach the sweep was passed over all the area outside of the 6-fathom (36 feet) curve, and 15 reefs not indicated on the charts were discovered within the area investigated. In Jericho Bay two additional uncharted reefs were discovered. Three chartered power boats were used in operating the sweep. In December Mr. Heck was assigned to the command of the steamer Hydrographer under orders to do special work in Hampton Roads, Virginia, in connection with the Jamestown Exposition. Hydrographic work was done to. establish the 4 and 5 fathom curves between Old Point Comfort and Newport News Bar and to devefop the anchorage in the vicinity of Newport News Middle Ground. An area of square miles was covered by soundings, involving 1 12 miles of lines sounded and 6 621 soundings. Three ranges were determined on the north shore of Hampton Roads and one on Old Point Comfort. Two marks were placed on each' range in the water on Hampton Bar and one on shore on each range. The positions of the marks were determined by triangulation. The positions of three electric railways in the vicinity of Willoughby Spit were determined and 5 miles of their lines were located. The work in the vicinity of Hampton Roads was completed between January 2 and February 21. From March 10 to June 4 examinations were made with the long wire sweep of certain selected areas in the vicinity of Key West, Fla. The examinations were made

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Hydrography: 167 square miles of area covered, 2 593 miles of lines sounded, 93 447 soundings made, 6 tide stations occupied, and 4 hydrographic sheets completed. Topography: 1 square mile of area covered. Triangulation: 6 stations occupied.

In response to a request from the Secretary of the Treasury, a topographic survey was made (September 10 to 15) of Fishermans Island, at the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, where a national quarantine station is located. Several old triangulation stations were used, and two new stations were established on the island. Four men and a boat were furnished by the stea,mer Hydrographer for this work, which was completed on September 1 5. On October 25 Assistant Miller, commanding the steamer Hydrographer, began hydrographic work in Chesapeake Bay at the south end. The work continued until April 15, and during this time a hydrographic survey was made of the eastern part of Horseshoe Shoal, off Old Point Comfort; of Plum Tree Bar, off Back River; of the tail of Horseshoe Shoal; of the long narrow Middle Ground Shoal; and of the ship channel leading to Baltimore. Lines of soundings were made at intervals of 200 meters and these were crossed with a similar set of lines. There was a great deal of stormy weather during the season, and the signals erected in the water were carried away almost immediately. A hydrographic survey was also made of Willoughby Bay and approaches, and the positions of six beacons, established in connection with the anchorage for naval vessels off the Jamestown Exposition, were determined. The work closed on April I5, as stated above, and the vessel proceeded to Washington.

The work completed by Mr. Pagenhart extends from the vicinity of Pocatello to Humphrey, along the Oregon Short Lirie Railway. Three of the bench marks established by the railway company were used as permanent bench marks in this line. The distance leveled was 201 kilometers and 58 permanent bench marks were established. The line was leveled once in each direction and numerous temporary bench marks were used to compare the results from the two measures. When the required degree of accuracy was not obtained between adjacent bench marks by leveling between them, as stated above, the work was repeated until the discrepancy was reduced to the allowable limit. In September and October leveling in Ohio and Pennsylvania was done to eliminate discrepancies in certain railroad levels which it was desirable to use in adjusting the level net of the United States. These levels were extended along the Baltimore and Ohio Railway between Greenwich and Sullivan, Ohio (17 kilometers); between Ellwood City and Monaco, Pa. (23 kilometers), over the Baltimore and Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Erie railways; and between Alli~nce and Youngstown, Ohio (72 kilometers), over the Baltimore and Ohio and the Pennsylvania railways.

In response to a request from the Navy Department, the preparation of a speed-trial course in the vicinity of Goleta, on Santa Barbara Channel, was in progress on July 1, and the work was completed on the 19th. A suitable range, 1 nautical mile in length, was selected and marked by erecting front and rear beacons at each end. These range beacons were connected with the coast triangulation and the distance between them along the trial course was determined in this way. Substantial structures, securely anchored to concrete foundations, were erected and they will last many years. Assistance was rendered Commander H. T. Mayo, U.S. Navy, Light-House Inspector of the Twelfth district, at his request, in selecting the proper positions for the buoys to mark the trial course and in determining their positions. A portion of the work involved in the investigation of the effect of the San Francisco earthquake of April 18 1906 upon the triangulation in California was assigned to Assistant Pratt, and he began this work on August+ All the necessary preparations, involving the recovery of old stations, the posting of . heliotropers, etc., were made, and the observing party reached the first station on September 21. The work was continued, whenever the weather and other conditions permitted, during the remaining portion of the fiscal year. Observations were made to determine the horizontal angles at five primary stations, and an azimuth was measured at one station. The weather was exceptionally unfavorable and caused serious delay at all stations, to secure suitable conditions for observations over the long lines included in the work. Heliotropes by day and signal lights at night were used at the stations observed upon, but long delays at all the stations resulted from cloudy weather and fog at night.

SUMMARY OF REsur,Ts.-848 kilometers of lines completed and 214 bench marks established.

The extension of the standard levels was in progress on August 7 under the direction of Aid E. H. Pagenhart, and on that date Aid Roy relie\red him as chief of party, and continued the work until October 5, when the line was completed to Butte, Mont. The route followed the Oregon Short Line Railway. On October 17 leveling work began at Ogden, Utah, and was completed to Salt Lake City on December 8. The weather was very unfavorable, and the progress of the work slower than usual. The Salt Lake base line of the transcontinental triangulation was connected with this line, thus determining its elevation by precise leveling now continuous to the ocean on both the eastern and western coasts. The party was transferred to Barstow, Cal., and began work there on December 13. The work continued until May 20, when the line was completed to Las Vegas, Nev. The route followed the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway to Leastalk, Cal., and then the San Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake Railway to L.as Vegas. North of Daggett, Cal., it was necessary for the party to live in camp, as the country affords nothing except the railroad to facilitate the progress of tl:~e work, and the party suffered many hardships. From Las Vegas the party returned to Butte, Mont., and on May 31 began work on the extension of the lines to Billings, Mont., along the Northern Pacific Railroad. The work continued without interruption until June 30, when it was in progress in the vicinity of Willow Creek, Mont.

(C. H. SINCLAIR.] SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Astronomic observations: 1 azimuth measured. occupied. Triangulation: 8 stations

The reoccupation of certain triangulation stations in California for the purpose of determining whether their relative position was disturbed by the earthquake of April, 1906, was assigned to Assistant Sinclair. Preparations for the work began in San Francisco on July 9. An azimuth station at Santa Cruz and several triangulation stations in the region around Monterey Bay were recovered. Some of these were stations in the primary work, situated on the tops of mountains and the difficulty of reaching them caused delay, so that observations of angles did not begin until August 23. Horizontal angles were observed at four stations and observations to determine an azimuth were made at one. The work in this region was greatly delayed by fog, and it was not completed until the close of January. The party was then moved to the vicinity of Redwood City to assist in the work already·in progres~ in that region. A g:i:eat deal of delay was caused by unfavorable weather, and the observations of horizontal angles at the four stations assigned to the party were not completed until April 9. The instruments were returned to Washington, the outfit was stored at San Francisco, and the observer started to Washington on April 14.

A portion of the work necessary to determine the effect of the California earthquake on the triangulation in the disturbed region was assigned to Assistant Smith. He reached San Francisco on July 9 and the work was continued from July 9 to 24 and from September 24 to March l, the interruption in the work being caused by the necessity of assigning Assistant Smith temporarily to other duty. In July several old triangulation stations were recovered in the vicinity of Tomales Bay and some new ones were selected. Signals were erected at these stations, but no observations were made, as the service of the observer was needed on the Alaska boundary work. Work in connection with the investigation of t.he effect of the earthquake was resumed on September 24 in the vicinity of Point Arena. Nine old stations were recovered and one new one was established. Observations of horizontal angles were made at all these stations and the work was completed on October 29. Similar work was begun after this date in the vicinity of Fort Ross, and 12 old stations were recovered and occupied for the measurement of horizontal angles. This work was completed on December 28 and the party moved to Colma, 8 miles south of San Francisco. Six stations in this vicinity were recovered and two new ones were established. Observations of horizontal angles were finished at six of these stations on February 26, thus completing the work assigned to this party. Serious delay was caused by rain and fogs.

of the presence of the vessel in various localities to obtain magnetic observations on shore and at sea. The vessel sailed from Baltimore on July 19, and on the following day magnetic observations were made in Hampton Roads, Virginia. The vessel reached Rockland on July 24. Observations were made on shore and on board the vessel, and these observations were repeated in October. Observations were also made at sea near Ram Island, on shore near Salem and at Boston, at sea en route to Baltimore, in Chesapeake Bay, and on shore at Baltimore. Special examinations were made in East Penobscot Bay and Eggemoggin Reach to define all shoal spots discovered by a party operating a long wire sweep in this region. In addition to this work numerous other areas were examined with channel sweeps and by sounding. These channel sweeps were attached to the vessel and to two launches. The sweeps were set at different depths as required and were constantly used while running lines of soundings at intervals of from 10 to 20 meters apart within the areas under examination. While this work was in progress a careful search was made for a rock supposed to exist just outside the black buoy at the entrance to Casco Passage with 14 feet of water on it, but no such rock was found. An examination was also made near the northeast end of Great Spruce Island, where a shoal had been reported, and less water was found than sh.own on the chart. On August 31 the steam yacht Mohican was hauled off a shoal east of Saddle Island, near Rockport, Me., and an examination of the shoal showed much less water than indicated on the chart. An examination was also made of a shoal in the vicinity of Rockland, and the vessel proceeded to Portland to examine the area north of House Island in Portland Harbor. On November 1 the vessel went to Salem, Mass., where a search was mad~ for a reported rock on which the schooner (ole had struck in the vicinity of Powers Rock Buoy, and the examination showed that there is no uncharted rock in this locality.

Commercial steamers were used after reaching Sitka and a voyage was made through the principal passages of southeast Alaska. In June Dundas Bay was visited, and special courtesy was extended to the observer by Mr. R. B. Bell, superintendent of the Northwestern Fisheries Company, who gave him the use of. the company's tug and pilot for a trip through Lisiansky Strait and into all the bays along the coast between Cape Bingham and Khaz Bay and through Icy Passage. The work was in progress on June 30.
[W. C. HODGKINS, Commanding, Steamer Patterson.] SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Astronomic observations: i azimuth and 1 latitude determined. Base measurement: 2 _base lines measured. Hydrography: 106 square miles area covered; 200* miles lines sounded; 3 906* soundings made; 6 tide stations occupied, and 4 hydrographic sheets completed. Magnetic observations: 3 stations occupied on land and 2 stations at sea. Topography: 217 miles of general coast line surveyed and 6 topographic sheets completed.

On July 1 the steamer Patterson was at work in Alitak Bay at the southern end of Kodiak Island, and the survey of this region was continued until October 27. Considerable progress was made in the survey of Alitak Bay and Sitkinak Strait, and surveys were made of St. Paul Harbor, Kodiak Island, and of Anchorage Bay, on the shore of the mainland opposite the Semidi Islands. In doing this work parties were located on shore in camps, and the work was continued during the absence of the ship when trips were made for coal and other supplies. The work in Alitak Bay is not connected with other work in Alaska, and it was necessary to determine the position of a station by making astronomic observations. A suitable place·was selected and the necessary astronomic

observations were made while the other survey work was in progress. An observer was stationed at Kodiak to make observations at the astronomic station previously established at that place, and three round trips 'were made between the two stations to determine the difference of longitude by carrying chronometers and making comparisons after each trip with the chronometers left at the stations. A base line was measured on Tugidak Island, and from this line the triangulation was extended. Early in October the vessel was severely injured by drifting on a shoal in a violent storm after two anchor chains had broken. At first the ship could not be controlled under a full head of steam, but she was taken from the shoal in a short time without serious mJury. After losing two of the three anchors on board it was necessary to close work as soon as possible, and the vessel proceeded to Kodiak and sailed for Seattle on October 27. On May 26 the Patterson sailed from Seattle to resume work in Alaska, and reached Kodiak on June 4. Magnetic observations were made on land before starting and at the end of the voyage and at sea during the voyage. A self-registering tide gauge was established at Kodiak, and buoys were placed so as to mark two reefs in the approach to the town. A base line was measured and the survey of Usinka Passage begun without delay. The survey of the region in the vicinity of Kodiak was in progress at the close of thi:- fiscal year.
[H. W. RHODES, Commanding, Steamer McArthur.] SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Astronomic observations: 3 azimuths and 2 latitudes determined. Base measurement: 2 base Jines measured.

Magnetic observations: 1 station occupied. Topography: 23 square miles of area covered; 38 miles of general coast line surveyed, and 2 topographic sheets completed. Triangulation: 620 square miles of area covered; 6o stations occupied, and 62 geographic positions determined.

On July l the party on board the steamer McArthur was at Port Chatham at work on the triangulation from Barren Islands to Chiswell Islands. A base line was measured, and a self-registering tide gauge was established. A party was placed on shore to make observations for latitude and azimuth and to make tide observations. The triangulation was completed on October 3. Two lines of soundings were made between Port Chatham and the Chiswell Islands, and one between Port Chatham and Seldovia Harbor. The topographic and hydrographic work in Port Chatham was completed on October 14. The vessel sailed for Seattle on October 16, and reached there on the 30th. The vessel returned to Seldovia on June 2 and the survey of Iliamna Bay was begun on the 6th and was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

McGRATH.]

The survey of the coasts of the Philippine Islands was continued under the direction of Assistant McGrath, who represented the Superintendent in all matters requiring action without delay. As Director of Coast Surveys in the Philippine Islands he made plans for field operations and issued instruction_s for field work at the suboffice in Manila. The observations made in the field were computed, and drawings for charts of the regions surveyed were prepared for transmission to Washington for review and publication. Sailing Directions and Notices to Mariners were prepared and published. He was aided in this work by such advice and instructions issued from Washington as became necessary. The work was done under the same general plan of the division of expenses in force during the previous year. The National Government paid the salaries and subsistence of its technical corps detailed for duty in the Philippines, including several experts in the suboffice, furnished the instrumental equipment, paid the expenses of one large surveying steamer and for the supplies for two other surveying steamers, , paid the expense of chart publication, the traveling expenses of officers to and from the Philippine Islands, and the hire of launches. The Philippine government paid the operating expenses of two surveying steamers, paid for the crew and repairs of two other surveying steamers (not including pay of officers), the party expenses of several surveying parties on shore, the salaries of the office force, and for office supplies obtained in Manila, and furnished office accommodations and printing. There was a free exchange of information and good offices between the Survey and the various military and civil bureaus having common aims, and a gratifying interest was shown in responding to all requests for information. Special mention is made of the courtesies extended to the Survey by the Chief Engineer of the Philippines Division, the Chief of the Military Information Division, the Bureau of Navigation, and its Light-House and Port Works divisions, the Bureau of Public Works, and the Bureau of Customs. The Army was supplied with all available information required by each of the numerous parties recently employed on the military survey of the region in the vicinity of Manila and by those at work in Samar and Mindanao. The Bureau of Public Lands and the Bureau of Forestry were furnished with very complete data for the work undertaken by those bureaus, and much assistance was rendered to the managers of the scheme of railroad developments in the Archipelago.

The Pathfinder has been steadily at work except from December l to February 8, when she was sent to Hongkong for the installation of new masts. The Research was absent from the working grounds only five weeks, which was the time required for the semiannual repairs. The Fathomer was at Manila from October 24 to December 5 and from May 9 to June 8. This steamer has not required any extensive repairs and has been most satisfactory as a 'fOrking vessel. The Romblon was at Manila from October 27 to December 6 and from ·March 30 to May 10 outfitting and having repairs made. The Marinduque was at Manila from November 3 to December 12 and was repaired and examined. She returned to Manila on April l 2 with a very moderate list of repairs, but one shaft was found to be in such condition that the vessel was pronounced unfit for work in ariy but sheltered waters. A new shaft was ordered, the other repairs were made, and the vessel sailed on :May 22. The repairs to the Fathomer, !vlarinduque, and Romblon were made at Manila, and the Research was repaired at Iloilo.
OFFICE WORK.

Twenty-two drawings for·charts were completed and forwarded to Washington to be printed. Eight of these were for new charts, nine were complete drawings for new editions, and five were drawings with extensive corrections for new editions. The following publications were prepared, verified, and published: Notices to Mariners, Nos. 7 to 10, l 906; Notices to Mariners, Nos. 1 to 7, 1907; Sailing Directions, Section 111, Panay, Negros, Cebu, and adjacent islands, 1906 (third edition).

and an azimuth was determined on the south end of Concepcion Island. The topographic work was completed to Rogalumbi Island, and the hydrographic work to a line between Point Malpal and Culebra Island. The vessel was repaired, and in March (19th to 25th) some triangulation was done in Guimaras Straits and along the coast of Panay northward to the Gigantes Islands. On April 14 work was resumed on the north coast of Ncgros and was in progress on June 30, The triangulation was completed to the Bocaboc and Don islands, and the topography was extended eastward from Sic~ba to Bito Point. A considc~able amount of hydrographic work was completed around the large shoal north of Cadiz and Sagay and along the east coast of Panay.

The survey along the cast coast of Luzon in the vicinity of Atimonan was begun by Assistant Denson, commanding the steamer Marinduque, on April 28, 1906, and was continued during the remainder of the fiscal year, as stated in the Annual Report for 1906, but no statistics were available when that report was printed. The figures given above include all work done after the date mention~d. A base line was measured and an azimuth was determined in the vicinity of Atimonan. On May 6, 1906, the vessel proceeded to Port Lampon, and a survey in this vicinity was completed on May 27. On May 28 work began in Polillo Harbor, on the east coast of Poliilo Island, and a survey of the harbor was completed. A survey was made of Hook Bay, and work was continued in Burdens Bay and vicinity until July 20, when enough work had been done to develop a deep-water channel into the bay. The weather had become very unfavorable and the ship returned to Atimonan and resumed work in that vicinity. On July 22 the launch Covadonga was found in a disabled condition and was towed to a safe anchorage, and the vessel then proceeded to Legaspi for coal, leaving a party at work on shore. When about 2 miles from the anchorage at that place, the coastguard cutter Rover ~as sighted off Sula flying the distress signal. The engines were found to be disabled and the cutter was towed to Legaspi. The triangulation was completed from Atimonan to Infanta and the islands of Alabat, Cabalete, Balesin, and Polillo were connected with the mainland. A survey was made in the vicinity of Mauban and of Cabalete and Alabat islands. The work closed for the season on October 25 and the vessel sailed next day for Catanduanes Island. A shoal off Cabagao was located and developed by sounding on the 29th, and the ship started to Manila the following day. The work was delayed by unfavorable weather, ten typhoons being recorded by the party during the season. On December 13 the vessel sailed from Manila for the west coast of Leyte, and magnetic observations were made during the voyage. Tide gauges were established at

Polompon and Bay bay, and the survey began on December 18. The work of the season is stated under the following headings: A topographic survey was made of the Cuatro and Camote islands, along 2 miles of the shore line south of Hindang and in Liloan Bay. The hydrographic work with a small boat covered the inshore soundings around the Cuatro and Camote islands and along the shore for a distance of 1 ! miles south of Hindang and along the northern edge of Danajon Banks. The banks are exposed to northeast winds and the water was too rough on them for work with a small boat. The work with the ship extended from the boat work to a distance of about 3 miles offshore to a depth of from i 50 to 200 fathoms with lines one-third of a mile apart, and outside this limit to a depth of 400 fathoms with lines 2 miles apart. An examination was made of a shoal off Hindang which had been previously surveyed. The triangulation extends from Limasana Island off the south point of Leyte to Bulalaqui Point, the northern point of Cebu, and connects the astronomic stations at Ormoc and Maasin. The vessel sailed from Manila in May and on May 23 began work between Verde and Mindoro islands. The work was continued until June 18, and during this time the topographic work was extended along the north coast of Mindoro from Port Galera to Bagalayag Point. Hydrographic work done in South Pass, Verde Island Passage, from the eastern end of Verde Island to the eastern end of Marica ban Island, and in Verde Island Passage from Bagalayag Point and Cape Santiago to the eastern end of Maricaban Island.

Dase measurement:

Triangulation and base measurement work was in progress in the vicinity of Calapan, Mindoro, on July 1, under the direction of Assistant Ferguson. The measurement of the base line near Calapan was completed and observations were made at the six triangulation stations in the base net. Observations to determine an azimuth were made and two triangulation stations used in the hydrographic survey in this vicinity were occupied. The party returned to Manila on September I. Between October 8 and December 13 the triangulation along the central valley of Luzon was extended from the vicinity of Manila to Caballo Island at the entrance to Manila Bay. In this work observations were made at seven stations. On December 28 the party left Manila .for Lingayen for the purpose of remeasuring the base line near that place. This work was completed and observations were made at four triangulation stations in the vicinity of the base line. The party returned to Manila on January 22.

Hydrographic work on the west coast of Luzon was in progress oil February 1, when Assistant King took command, in the vicinity of the Capones Islands. The work was continued until February 26, when it was completed to Botalon Point. A reference to this work is made under the head of L. H. Westdahl, the former commander of the vessel, and the statistics of the work accomplished to February 26 are given in the statement under that head. On March 4 the survey of the coast was begun at Talin Point on the west coast of Luzon and was completed to Cape Santiago on March 30. The vessel was repaired at Manila and then proceeded to the east coast of Luzon. On May 13 and 14 a reported rock off Port Gubat was located and a hydrographic survey was made in its vicinity. On the 14th the vessel reached Port Sula and supplementary work began in this locality. This work was finished on the 17th and the vessel proceeded to Mercedes at tht> entrance to San Miguel Bay. The survey of this bay began immediately and was practically completed before June 30. A topographic survey of the Calaguas group of islands was also made. A well-sheltered anchorage with soft mud bottom was found behind Canuit Island and Assistant King reports that he considers it a safe anchorage in typhoons. Lines of soundings were made across the bay at intervals of about 550 meters for the offshore work and at intervals of 300 meters, perpendiculars to the shore, for the inshore work. Assistant King's report contains an interesting description of the hydrographic features of regions surveyed and information which is valuable as Coast Pilot data.

On March 23 the survey of the. south coast of Mindanao was in progress by the party on the steamer Fathomer, under the command of Assistant D. B. Wainwright. He was succeeded in command by Assistant Parker on that date and the work was continued until May 2. During this period the triangulation was extended to the head of Sibuguey Bay and down the east shore to a point about opposite Port Banga. The topographic work covers the shore from Point Vitali to Buluan Island, and the hydrographic work extends from the south side of Tunganan Bay to Bagolibud Point. After the close of the work in Sibuguey Bay a search was made for an unchartered shoal reported in Basilan Strait, southwest of San Mateo, and it was shown that no shoal exists at the place reported. Repairs were made to the vessel at Manila, and on June 16 she sailed forCatanduanes Island to make a survey of the east coast of the island. A survey of Port Anajao was begun immediately, as it offers the only safe anchorage in this vicinity during typhoons, and enough work was done to make it safe to enter the port in bad weather. It was found neces!?ary to extend the triangulation from the work previously done on Maqueda Channel, across the north end of the island, and then down the cast coast. This work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

The survey of the north coast of Samar, west of Laoang, was in progress on July 1, under the direction of Assistant Quillian, until September 7, and after that date, under the direction of Assistant Maupin. The work was continued until November 24 and the survey along the coast was completed from Livas Point to Bohon. The weather became so unfavorable that the work was suspended at Bohon and the party returned to Manila.

On July 1 the survey of the east coast of Luzon, between Lohuy Island and San Miguel Bay, was in progress, as stated in the report for the previous fiscal year. The

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

work began on May 9, and the statistics given above include the work after that date, as no statistics were available when the previous report was sent to the printer. The work was continued until October 16, and during this period the survey was completed between the points named, a distance of 50 miles. The topographic survey was confined to the shore line of the coast and -of the islands close inshore. The hydrographit work with the steamer began in not less than IO fathoms of water, as near the shore as it was safe to go, and extended seaward to a depth of 30 to· 35 fathoms, on a line about 6 miles outside the islands along the shore. Repairs were made to the ship at Manila, and work on the south coast of Mindanao was begun on December 10 and continued until March 23, when Assistant Wainwright was detached from the command of the vessel. During this period the survey of the coast was extended from Sacol Island, northeast of Zamboanga, to the Tigbaon Islands, at the entrance to Sibuguey Bay, a distance of 68 miles. The coast is heavily wooded in this region, and it was necessary to use signals placed on shoals offshore, and to measure a base line on a coral reef, which was only availa,ble at a low stage of the tide. The topographic work was rendered difficult by the rocky bluffs with deep water at their bases, by the coral reefs, and by the growth of mangrove extending from the shore over the waters, so that the plane table could not be used outside of them at more than half tide. The inshore hydrography presented no unusual features. Nearly all the area sounded by the steamer was in depths of less than 100 fathoms, and this work was completed nearly to Port Banga.

The survey of Gumay Bay, on the east coast of Samar, was in progress on July 1, and work in this region was continued until August 7. During this time the survey of the bay was completed and the work was extended northward to Benay Island. An examination was made of a shoal off Macati Island and of a reef off Taig Point, and on August IO work began in Port Libas and was continued along this coast until November 16·. A survey was made of Port Libas, Port Borongan, and Matarinao Bay and along the coast between Port Libas and Matarinao Bay, except for a short space south of Llorente, where the topography and hydrography were not completed.

the north end of Samal Island, and was extended around the head of the gulf and down the east coast to a point nearly opposite the south end of Samal Island. The triangulation, hydrography, and topography were completed within these limits. It was difficult to extend the triangulation along the channel east of Samal Island on account of the heavy growth of timber on the shores, and quadrilaterals could not always be used, as it would have involved a very large amount of work to clear the lines. The hydrographic work with the launch extended to the 100-fathom curve, and outside that line the ship was used while making soundings. After the work noted above was completed the survey on the west shore of the gulf was extended south to a point opposite the south end of Samal Island, thus completing the survey of the Gulf of Davao north of the south end of Samal Island.

On July i the survey of the east coast of Luzon, .between Daet and Dagdap Point, including the islands offshore and the passage inside Canimo Island to San Miguel Bay, was · in progress under the direction of Assistant Westdahl, commanding the steamer Romblon. The statistics given above cover the whole season from May 22 to October 24, 19o6, as no statistics were available when the previous report was compiled. The survey of the coast, including triangulation, topography, and hydrography, was extended along the coast from the vicinity of Canimo Island to Point Jesus, which is about 15 miles west of Port Mambulao, a distance of 50 miles. The work closed on October 24 and the vessel returned to Manila for repairs. On December 6 the vessel proceeded to Cape Bolinao and began work on the inshore hydrography south of that point to Dasol Bay. A self-registering tide gauge was established in Bolinao Harbor and the sounding work began as soon as the signals were erected. A whaleboat was used while working inside the 25-fathom curve; outside this line the ship was used. In December: the work was completed to Agno Bay, and a tide gauge was established in the bay east of Caiman Point. The hydrographic survey was extended south to Dasol Bay in January, and on the 19th the vessel proceeded to Botolan Point. The work was continued between this point and Capones Islands until February 1, when Assistant Westdahl was relieved of the command on the expiration of his term of service in the Philippine Islands. The work was continued until February 26, with Assistant H. D. King in command of the vessel, and the statistics of the work during this period are included in the summary given above. The hydrography along the coast was completed to Caloguaguin Bay, or from Caponli!s Islands to Botolan Point.

The building formerly occupied as an observatory was required for other use, and the construction of suitable observatory buildings on leased ground was authorized. An examination was made of five available locations and observations were made to test their relative merits, with the result of locating the new buildings one-third of a mile from Vieques, on an estate known as the "Cofi." The buildings were completed and the instruments were transferred early in April. A continuous record of the relative force of the three elements of terrei;trial magnetism was obtained except for the period April 4 to IO, when the transfer of the instrument was made. The record on the seismog~aph was also continuous, except for a short period in March and April, when the instruments were moved. Observations were made twice every week to determine the absolute value of the magnetic elements, and observations were made at intervals of ten days to determine the local time. On the 1st and 15th of each month until February the magnetograph was made to record at a rapid rate for two hours.
[P. A. WELKER, Command!ng, Steamer Bache.]
SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Hydrography: 255 square miles of area covered; 1 648 miles of lines sounded; 28 340 soundings made; 1 tide station occupied, and 7 hydrographic sheets completed. Magnetic observations: 1 station occupied on land, and 12 stations occupied at sea.

Hydrographic work in Porto Rico was assigned to Assistant Welker, commanding the steamer Bache, and magnetic observations were made while the vessel was en route to and from the working ground. The first observations were made in Hampton Roads, and a special route was followed from Diamond Shoal Light-ship to San Juan in order to make magnetic observations in specified localities, and the set of observations was completed by observing on board and on shore in Fajardo Roads, Porto Rico. In returning to Baltimore a prescribed route was again followed, and a similar set of observations was secured. The hydrographic work during the season included surveys off the south and east coasts of the island of Vieques and off the north and east coast of the island of Porto Rico. Work was carried on in different localities to take advantage of weather conditions, and in this way very little time was lost as the result of unfavorable weather. A special examination of the region where a shoal had been reported off the east coast of the island of Porto Rico was made under most favorable conditions, when the location of all the shoals within a radius of several miles could be clearly distinguished by the light-green color of the water. in their vicinity, but no indication of the existence of an uncharted shoal was seen or was found by sounding. The work completed on the north coast of Porto Rico extends from Cape San Juan to the entrance to San Juan Harbor, but this does not include the inshore work, which consists of a strip one-half to one mile wide along the coast where work was impracticable gt the time without unreasonable expense and delay, on account of the usual rough condition of the sea. The work along the north coast extends seaward about IO nautical miles. Within the area surveyed a dangerous shoal was located and defined. The work closed on May 27 and the vessel reached Baltimore on June 6.

SPECIAL DUTY.
NEW YORK.

[A. T. l\losMAN.)

The trigonometric survey of Greater New York was continued by the city authorities under the direction of Assistant :Vlosman. During the year the triangulation was completed in the Borough of Richmond. Forty stations were occupied and 48 geogn1phic positions were determined. A reconnaissance was then made of a portion of the Borough of Qu~ens, covering 99 ·square miles, and in this area 62 points were selected as triangulation stations. The field work was suspended during the greater portion of the year on account of lack of funds for field expenses.
MISSISSIPPI RIVER COMMISSION.

[H. P.

RITTER.)

Assistant Ritter continued on duty as a member of the Mississippi River Commission and performed the duties required of a member of the Commission. He also served as a member of the board to examine and report on a 14-foot channel in the Mississippi River from St. Louis to the Gulf of Mexico.
UNITED STATES AND CANADA BOUNDARY.

[O. H. TITTMANN.)

The work of remarking this boundary west of the Rocky Mountains was continued during the year, under direction of the joint commission in which Messrs. 0. H. Tittmann and C. D. Walcott represent the United States and Mr. W. F. King took part as Commissioner for Great Britain. Observations were made at the triangulation stations necessary to perfect a connection with the triangulation along the Pacific coast in the United States, and the work of opening and monumenting the line was continued. In October Messrs. 0. B. French and C. A. Bigger, representatives of the Commissioners, were sent to Portal, N. Dak., to mark the boundary between Portal and North Portal in Canada. A boundary monument was recovered on each side of the town, and the line was reproduced and marked for the use of the custom-house officers. In June representatives of the Commissioners, Messrs. C. H. Sinclair and N_. Ogilvie, began the work of numbering the monuments for final inspection and acceptance by the Commissioners. This work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. The work of opening and remonumenting the boundary between the United States and Canada along the northern border of Vermont was begun under the supervision of Mr. 0. H. Tittmann and Mr. W. F. King, Commissioners of the United States and Great Britain, respectively. This work began in the vicinity of Beecher Falls, Vt.,
51

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

on August 1 and was continued until November 13. During this period 30 miles of the boundary westward from Beecher Falls was practically completed. A vista 30 feet wide was cut through the forest, the old monuments were reset in concrete bases, and the new monuments are intervisible wherever it was possible to accomplish this. Large-scale maps of the country in the immediate vicinity of the boundary were made and the topographic survey was extended to a distance of about 1 mile on each side of the boundary. Monuments were established on each side of the principal houses intersected by the boundary and marks were made on all houses found to be on the line, to indicate the position of the boundary. Work was resumed on this portion of the boundary on May 8 and was in progress on June 30. During this time the work, as outlined above, was completed over 20 miles of the line. The work was in charge of Assistant J. B. Baylor and Mr. G. C. Rainboth, D. L. S., the representatives in the field of the United States and British commissioners, respectively.
ALASKA BOUNDARY.

(0. H.

TITTMANN.]

The demarcation of the boundary between Alaska and Canada along the one hundred and forty-first meridian of west longitude was undertaken, as provided in the convention between the United States and Great Britain (signed April 2 r, r 906), by Mr. 0. H. Tittmann, the Commissioner representing the United States, and Mr. W. F. King, the Commissioner representing Great Britain. The Commissioners sent astronomers to the boundary where it crosses the Yukon River, who proceeded to "ascertain by the telegraphic method a convenient point on the one hundred and forty-first meridian of west longitude" by establishing such a point from determinations of the proper difference of longitude from stations in each country whose longitude was already known from independent determinations by the telegraphic method made by observers representing the countries concerned. Mr. Edwin Smith was the United States astronomer who took part in this work, and qe reports that the officers on duty at the Army post at Fort Egbert, Alaska, rendered every possible assistance in facilitating the work. Assistant Smith reached Fort Egbert on August 12, and the work was completed on August 29. In the spring, the Commissioners sent parties to the one hundred and forty-first meridian to begin tracing and marking the boundary. Messrs. G. C. Baldwin and F. A. McDiarmid, representing the Commissioners of the United States and Great Britain, respectively, reached the boundary at Yukon River on April 20, determined the position of a "north and south line" passing through the point whose position had been fixed as noted above, and the~ began tracing this line to the southward. Nine miles of the boundary had been traced on June 30, and the work was in progress on that date. On June 13 the work of opening a vista along the boundary and erecting monuments to mark the line was begun, and this work was in progress on June 30, under the direction of Thomas Riggs, jr. In southeastern Alaska, several parties were at work on the demarcation of the boundary at the close of the previous report. In the vicinity of the Chilkat River, Mr. D. W. Eaton extended the triangulation to the boundary and determined the

position of two points on the line. One monument was placed in position on each side of the Chilkat River. A plane table survey was made of the valley from the boundary to a point 2' miles below. Phototopographic camera stations were occupied and negatives were obtained covering about 100 square miles of territory, of which no topographie survey had previously been made. The boundary line between peaks S 6000 and S 6850, a distance of 30 kilometers, was traced and a profile was prepared. A vista along a portion of the line was cleared in the Chilkat Valley on both sides of the river. Mr. 0. M. Leland extended the triangulation of the previous season to Chilkoot Pass, and beyond, and determined the position of peaks S 6500 and S 6000. Monuments were placed in position on each side of Chilkoot Pass to mark the line at that place. On June 30 work was in progress in the vicinity of Lynn Canal and the triangulation was being extended up the Katzehin River: Mr. Fremont Morse extended the triangulation from a base line on Dry Bay up the Alsek River to the boundary and from the same base to Disenchantment Bay via Yakutat Bay. The positions of the following boundary peaks were determined: S 12430, S 9500, Mount Fairweather; S 5800, S 7500, S 6825, S 8600, S 8900, S 8000, S 10000 (Mount Seattle), S 16400 (Mount Herbert), S 12400, S 15617 (Mount Vancouver), S 14700 (Mount Cook), S 17978 (Mount St. Elias). The boundary line between Mount Cook and S 5800, a distance of 86 miles, was located. Numerous camera stations were occupied and negatives were made in the phototopographic survey of the region in the vicinity of the triangulation. On June 30 work was in progress in the vicinity of Glacier Bay.

The duty of representing the United States as delegates to the Fifteenth General Conference of the International Geodetic Association, at Budapest, Hungary, was performed by 0. H. Tittmann, Superintendent, and J. F. Hayford, Inspector of Ge~detic Work, Coast and Geodetic Survey. The conference was in session from September 20 to 28, inclusive. The delegates presented a report which gave an account of an investigation of the figure of the earth, based on the trigonometric and astronomic work done in the United States. The Conference voted to continue the latitude service unaltered, at least until the next meeting of the Association, and a formal vote was taken to record the action of the adhering Governments in prolonging the convention of 1895 for a new period of ten years. The Conference met at Budapest upon the invitation of the Imperial Government of Austria-Hungary and numerous courtesies were extended to the delegates by officers of the Government and the city.

DETAILS OF OFFICE OPERATIONS.
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE.
ANDREW BRAID,

Assistant in Charge.

The Assistant in Charge of the Office has direct supervision over the work of the divisions named below. The Miscellaneous Section is a part of the immediate office of the Assistant in Charge.
COMPUTING DIVISION.

The current.work of this Division has been kept up to date. The demand for information of various kinds has continued as great as during the preceding year, but has not shown any increase. The close attention paid to the systemization of the methods and the increased use of computing machines have resulted in increasing the output in all classes of computation with consequent reduction in cost. The computations of the precise leveling work and of the astronomic observations have been made as the field work progressed. Good progress was made in the reduction of the triangulation in California north of Monterey Bay to the United States Standard Datum, and the office computation of the six primary base lines measured in the summer of 1906 was completed. A large group of triangulation in the vicinity of St. Croix River, Maine, was. computed. An unusually large number of astronomic determinations of latitude, longitude, and azimuth were made in _the field during the year with consequent increase in this class of computations. The average effective force of the Division during the year numbered 12 computers, not including the Chief.
DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

The preparation of the results of the magnetic observations on land and at sea during the previous fiscal year was completed for publication in the Annual Report for that year, and the computation of the observations made during the current year were made as the work progressed. The compilation of earthquake data recorded by seismographs at Cheltenham, Md., Vieques, P. R., and Honolulu, Hawaii, was completed to the end of the year 1906, and the results were furnished to the International Seismological Association and to others interested in this subject. The routine work of the Division was kept up to date, and information was prepared in response to numerous requests received during the year. · A report on the "Distribution of the Magnetic Declination in the United States for Ja~uary l, 1905, with lsogonic Chart and Secular Change tables," was prepared for pub57

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, rc;p7.

lication, and considerable progress was made in the preparation of a publication on the "Distribution of the Magnetic Elements in the United States for January 1 1 1905.'' Good progress was made in the reduction of the work at the magnetic observatories previous to 1905, and the observations of vertical intensity made by eye readings at the Cheltenham observatory on certain specified days in 1902 and 1903 in cooperation with the German Antarctic Expedition were reduced, and the results were transmitted to the German Government. Information was furnished to several magneticians in foreign countries to aid them in making special investigations.
TIDAL DIVISION.

Harmonic analyses were completed for three sta,tions with a combined length of year and 7 months. Nonharmonic reductions were made for 65 stations with a combined length of 14 years and 4 months. Tide notes were prepared for 680 stations on 167 charts and 52 original hydrographic sheets. Tidal information was furnished to field parties and to individuals in response to 330 requests for information, involving the preparation of 670 descriptipns of bench marks, tidal data for 544 stations, and current data for 40 stations. Tabulations of high and low water and of hourly heights of the sea were made for 27 years and 7 months of self-registering tide-gauge records from r l 7 stations, and mean sea level was computed for 20 stations from records with a combined length of nearly 27 years. There were received, examined, and registered in this Division an aggregate of 16 years of records from self-registering tide gauges at 29 stations, together with 4 years and 4 months of records from staff gauges, and from sources outside the Survey 9 years and 10 months of records at 14 stations. Current observations at r ooo stations were reduced and the results entered on cards in order to make them easily accessible. The Tide Tables for 1908 were prepared and the proof for the Tide Tables for 1907 and 1908 was read during the year. The tide predictions for \Vellington and Auckland, New Zealand, for the year I908 were furnished in response to a request from the Secretary of the Marine Department.
l

DRAWING AND ENGRAVING DIVISION.

The Division is divided into five sections: The Drawing, the Engraving, the Printing, the Photographing, and the Electrotyping sections. Each section does the work incijcated by its title, and the combined result is shown on the charts published and issued by the Survey.
Drawing Section.

During the year the following drawings for new charts were completed:

CHART DIVISION.

A new edition of the chart catalogue was completed and the proof was read. A new edition of the Table of Depths in the United States, including Alaska, Porto Rico, and the Philippine Islands was prepared. The issue of charts during the year was 3 per cent larger than during the .preceding year, and the correspondence in the chart section shows an increase of 7 per cent. The work necessary in correcting the published charts to date of issue requires a great deal of time and is increasing. Charts were received as follows from the Drawing and Engraving Division:

All the work in connection with the sale of charts is <lone in this Division. All the corrections necessary to keep the charts up to date were indicated in this Division, and a Notice to Mariners was prepared every month, giving information in regard to changes in the location oi aids to navigation and all other data in possession of the Bureau important for mariners to know. The following work was completed: 2 I charts reviewed for publication; I73 charts, corrections on office standards verified; 50 charts, corrections on proofs verified; 19 hydrographic sheets examined and verified.
INSTRUMENT DIVISION.

In this Division an account was kept of all instruments and general property owned by the Survey or purchased during the year, except the articles on the inventory of the office at Washington. All necessary repairs were made to the instruments used by the Survey. Minor repairs were made to the office buildings and furniture, and progress was made in constructing a new tide-predicting machine. The various kinds of acetylene lamps for sale for use on automobiles were examined, and a ·" 9-inch" lamp was selected as being most available for use as a signal lamp in

A special receiver for "wireless telegraph signals was perfected and three sets of the apparatus were constructed. Experiments made with these receivers show that signals sent at sea over distances up to 50 miles can be readily received for comparison of chronometers used in the determination of longitude by the telegraphic method. No special expert knowledge is required to operate the device. A new gas engine was installed for the electrotyping work, and a cement-lined pit was constructed just outside the engine room, and the exhaust pipe from the engine was led into it. This does away entirely with the noise caused by the exhaust discharge. Special eye-piece micrometers were designed and made as additions to the theodolites prepared ·for use in the demarcation of the Alaska Boundary along the one hundred and forty-first meridian. Four transits were fitted with transit micrometers and provided with new electric illuminating lamps, with devices for regulating the illumination to correspond to stars of any 11iagnitude. A 10-inch circle with 10-minute spaces and a vernier reading to minutes were graduated for the Bureau of Standards. Three duplicates of the spirit level devised and adopted by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, made for the Canadian government by private parties, subject to inspection and approval by the Superintendent, were carefully examined and recommended for approval.
I,IBRARY AND ARCHIVES.

The current routine work was kept up to date. The records of observations made in the field were indexed as they were received. Progress was made in the preparation of a complete author and subject catalogue. The tables show the accessions and issues during the year:

GENERAL STATEMENT.

The Coast and Geodetic Survey has done much triangulation in California to serve as a control or framework for its surveys along the coast and other surveys. The results of all the triangulation south of the latitude of Monterey Bay, together with the primary triangulation to the northward, have already been published.* In 1906 the results of the triangulation in California from the vicinity of l\fonterey Bay northward, were being prepared for publication. The reports from various sources in regard to the effects of the earthquake of April 18, 1906, indicated that there had been relative displacements of the earth's surface of from 2 meters (7 feet) to 6 meters (20 feet) at various points near the great fault accompanying the earthquake. These were relative displacements of points on opposite sides of the fault and had been reported along all parts of the fault for 185 miles, from the vicinity of Point Arena, in ::Vlendocino County, to the vicinity of San Juan, in San Benito County. The average relative displacement was said to be about 3 meters (10 feet). Displacements of that size would so change the relative positions of points which had been determined by triangulation and so change the kngths and directions of the lines joining them that the triangulation would no longer be of value as a means of control for accurate surveys. The value of the triangulation could be restored only by repeating a sufficient amount of it to determine definitely the extent and character of the absolute displacements. It was therefore decided to repair the old triangulation, damaged by the earthquake, by doing new triangulation . . If the displacements of a permanent character had been limited to a narrow belt close to the fault, only a few triangulation points would have been affected. The available evidence, however, indicated that the m·ovements probably extended back from the fault for many miles on each side, and that the new triangulation necessary for repair purposes must, therefore, cover a wide belt.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

The new triangulation to repair the damage was completed in July, 1907. In addition to serving this practical purpose, it bas shown the character of the earth movements of l9o6, which were found to extend back many miles on each side of the fault. These are very interesting results from a purely scientific point of view. Moreover, there came to light, during the study of the movements of 1906, entirely unexpected evidence of earlier earth movements, probably in 1868, which a!so affected a large area. The purpose of this publication is to set forth fully the amount and nature of tnese two great displacements of large portions (at least 4 ooo square miles) of the earth's crust and to indicate the degree of certainty in regard to these displacements warranted by the evidence.
EXTENT OF NEW TRIANGULATION.

The new triangulation in California, done during the interval July 12, 19o6, to July 2, 1907, extends continuously northwestward from Mount Toro, in Monterey County, and Santa Ana Mountain, in San Benito County, to Ross Mountain and the vicinity of Fort Ross, in Sonoma County. This new continuous triapgulation, as indicated on map l, extends over an area 270 kilometers (170 miles) long and 80 kilometers (50 miles) wide, at its widest part. '1t includes the station known as Mocho, about l l ! miles northeast from Mount Hamilton and a station on Mount Diablo, both on the eastern side of the fault and 53 kilometers (33 miles) .from it. It also includes the Farallon Light-house on the west side of· the fault and 36 kilometers (22 miles) from it. There were in all 5 l old triangulation stations which were recovered and their new positions accurately determined by the new triangulation. The stations had been marked upon the ground by stone monuments, by bolts in rock, etc., or by permanent structures, such as the Farallon Light-house, Point Reyes Light-house, and the small dome of Lick Observatory, or were themselves permanent marks, as, for example, Montara Mountain Peak (a sharp peak). This continuous scheme consists of a chain of primary triangulation comprising the l l occupied stations, Mount Toro, Gavilan, Santa Cruz Azimuth Station, Loma Prieta, Sierra Morena, Mocho, Mount Tamalpais, Point Reyes Hill, Tamales Bay, Sonoma Mountain, and Ross Mountain: triangulation of the secondary grade of accuracy extending from the stations Mount Tamalpais, Mount Diablo, Rocky Mound, and Red Hill, to the Pulgas Base near the southern end of San Francisco Bay, and triangulation of a tertiary grade of accuracy in three different localities, namely, in the vicinity of Colma west of San Francisco Bay, along Tamales Bay, and in the vicinity of Fort Ross, Sonoma County. . The primary and secondary triangulations are shown on map 1, and the tertiary triangulation on map 2. On these two maps the straight blue lines indicate lines over which observations were taken in the new triangulation. The small red circles indicate stations marked upon the ground, of which the relative positions were fixed by the triangulation. Observations were taken in both directions over each blue line which is unbroken throughout its length. Observations were taken in one direction only, from the solid ·end toward the broken end, over each blue line which is broken at one end. A station from which no blue line is drawn unbroken was not occupied. The position of such a station was determined by intersections from the occupied stations.

71

In addition to this continuous triangulation, a detached piece of new triangulation of the secondary grade of . accuracy, connecting old triangulation stations, was done in the vicinity of Point Arena. (See map 2 .) This makes the total number of old triangulation st~tions which were recovered and redetermined 61. In connection with the new triangulation, astronomic determinations of azimuth or true direction, were made by observations on Polaris at the stations Mount Tamalpais, Mocho, and Mount Toro. Four different observers, each with his own complete outfit and party, were engaged in the new work for an aggregate period of thirty-five months. The observers were all field officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, with previous experience in triangulation.
THE OLD TRIANGULATION.

The old triangulation fixing the positions of the points before the earthquake of April 18, 1906, was done in many years, extending from 1851 to 1899, as a part of the regular work of the Coast and Geodetic SurVey and without reference to the possible future use of this triangulation as a means of determining the movements of permanent character due to earthquakes. During the earlier years certain parts of this old triangulation had existed as detached triangulation not connected with other parts. Before 1906, however, all parts of the old triangulation had been connected with each other by triangulation to form one continuous scheme. It was also connected with other triangulation extending to many parts of the United States, including many of the interior States, as well as the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. In connection with studies of the evidence as to the earth movements set forth in this publication, it is important to note briefly the dates of the old triangulation which serves, in connection with the new triangulation of 1906-7, to determine changes in positions of mar~ed points on the earth's surface. During the years 1854-1860 primary triangulation was carried from the stations Rocky Mound, Red Hill, and Mount Tamalpais, northward to Ross Mountain, through a primary scheme practically identical with that shown on map l, except that the station Bodega was occupied in this earlier triangulation, though not in 1906-7. Tertiary triangulation, following substantially the scheme shown on map 2, was also done in 1856. to 1860, along Tomales Bay, starting with the line Tomales BayBodega, of the primary triangulation referred to in the preceding paragraph. In connection with this work the station Chaparral, of the Fort Ross triangulation, shown on map 2, was also determined. Primary triangulation was done during the years 1851 to 1854, connecting the group of stations, Mount Diablo, Rocky Mound, Red Hill, with the Pulg:e.s Base, the scheme being somewhat different from that shown On ma{> l, but equally direct and strong. During the years 1854, 1855, 1864, and 1866 primary triangulation was done connecting the stations in the vicinity of Rocky Mound, referred to in the preceding paragraph, with stations Gavilan, Santa Cruz, and Point Pinos Light-house, around Monterey Bay. This triangulation, for the greater part of. its length, consist~ of a single chain of triangles, affording, therefore, comparatively few checks upon the results. This practically completes the statement of triangulation done before l 868 which is concerned in the present investigation. The extent of the triangulation done between l 868 and 1906 is stated separately in the following paragraphs.

72

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

Northward of the line Mount Diablo-Mount Tamalpais but one station of the primary scheme shown on map 1 was determined by primary triangulation in the interval 1868-1906, namely, Ross Mountain. It was determined directly from the stations Mount Tamalpais, Mount Diablo, and Mount Helena, of the transcontinental triangulation.* · During the years 1876-1887 primary triangulation was extended southward (by substantially the same scheme as that shown on map l, except that station Gavilan was omitted) from the line Mount Diablo-Mount Tamalpais to the line Mount ToroSanta Ana. Some paintings were also taken on Gavilan, Point Pinos Light-house, and other stations in this vicinity, but not from a sufficient number of stations to furnish checked determinations independent of earlier determinations made before 1868. Secondary triangulation near Point Arena, forming the western extremity of the transcontinental triangulation, was done in the interval 1870-1892, the scheme being substantially the same as that shown on map 2, except that all stations were occupied. The triangulation fixing the initial stations, Fisher and Cold Spring, has been published.t Tertiary triangulation in the vicinity of Fort Ross was done in 1875-76, following a scheme similar to that shown on map 2, and starting from the line Bodega HeadRoss Mountain, as determined before 1868. Tertiary triangulation was done during various years from 1851 to 1899, extending from the vicinity of the Pulgas Base northward, spanning San Francisco Bay, to the Golden Gate, and thence southward to the vicinity of Colma, including stations shown on sketch 4, on map 2. The greater portion of this triangulation was done before 1868, but it is impracticable ·to separate the computations into two parts dealing with triangulation before and triangulation after 1868, respectively.
PERMANENT DISPLACEMENTS PRODUCED BY THE EARTHQUAKES OF 1868 AND 1906.

The following tables ( 1, 2, and 3) show the permanent displacements of various points as caused by the earthquakes of 1868 and 1906. These permanent displacements were determined by comparisons of the positions of identical points upon the earth's surface as determined by triangulation before and after the earthquakes in question. While for the sake of brevity in statement these movements are referred to the earthquakes of 1868 and 1906, the evidence furnished by the triangulation simply indicates the fact that the displacements in question took place some time during the two blank intervals within which no triangulation was done fixing the points in question; namely, the interval 1866-1874, including the 1868 earthquake, and the interval 1892 to July, 1906, including the 1906 earthquake. Neither does the triangulation furnish any evidenc~ indicating whether the displacements took place gradually, extending over many months and possibly years, or whether they took place suddenly. The evidence connecting the displacements of 1906 with the particular earthquake and indicating that they were sudden comes from other sources and will be commented upon later in this paper. The permanent displacements indicated in Tables l, 2, and 3 must be carefully distinguished from the vibrations of a more or less elastic character which take place during

earthquakes. These vibrations die out in a few seconds, minutes, or hours. While they are in progress, a given point on the earth's surface is in continuous motion along a more or less complicated path, which turns upon itself and leaves the point, at the end of the vibration, near the initial position. The displacements indicated in Tables 1, 2, and 3, on the other hand, remain for years, possibly for centuries. 1'hey are of a permanent character. The displaced point remains in the new position until another displacement occurs in some later earthquake or possibly slow relief of strain, accompanied by a creeping motion, causes a new permanent displacement. In Tables 1, 2, and 3 the first column gives the name of the station by which it may also be identified on map 1 or on map 2, or both. The second column gives its latitude at the time indicated in the heading. The third column gives the seconds only of the new latitude at the later time indicated in the heading. The fourth and fifth columns have the same significance ·with reference to the longitude as the second and third have with reference to the latitude of each point. The sixth column gives the north and south component along a meridian of the displacement. A plus sign in this column means that the point moved toward the south. The seventh column shows the east and west component of the motion. A plus sign in this column means that the point moved toward the east. The sixth and seventh columns were computed by converting the changes in latitude and longitude, respectively, into meters. By combining the values in columns 6 and 7, the direction and amount of the displacement were obtained as shown in columns 8, 9, and 10. In column 8 the direction of displacement is given, reckoned as geodetic azimuths are usually reckoned-clockwise around the whole circumference from south as zero. In this reckoning west is 90°, north 180°, and east 270°. Column 9 gives the amount of displacement in meters and column 10 gives it in feet. Column 11 shows the approximate distance of the point from the fault of 1906, measured approximately at right angles to the fault. In this column E indicates that the point is to the east of the fault and W that. it is to the west. For example: The fifth line of Table 1 indicates that during the earthquake of 1906 the Farallon Light-house moved 0.83 meter north and 1.57 meters west, or, in other words, moved 1.78 meters (5.8 feet) in azimuth 118° or 62° west of north, and that it is 37 kilometers (23 miles) from the fault of 1906 and to the west of it. In the heading the expression." Before 1868" refers to years within the interval 1851-1866. The expression" After 1868" refers to years within the interval 1874-1891, and" 1906-7" refers to dates within the interval July, 1906-July, 1907. The latitudes and longitudes given in tables are all computed upon the United States Standard Datum and differ somewhat from those now in use on the charts. and maps of this region. They are, however, the latitudes and longitudes to which all charts and maps should ultimately conform. Table 1 shows the displacements which occurred on April 18, 1906. Table 2 shows the displacements which occurred in 1868, and Table 3 shows the total, or combined, displacements in both 1868 and l 906. For some cases, as, for example, Point Reyes Hill, the separate displacements were not directly determined by the triangulation, but only the combined displacements. In such cases, if probable values could be derived for the separate displacements, indirectly, by inference from surrounding points, they were so derived and placed in the table. In each case such inferred displacements are clearly distinguished in the table from others

which were determined directly by measurement, by leaving the third and fifth columns blank and by having the values in the sixth to tenth columns inclosed in parentheses. All of the displacements given in Tables 1, 2, and 3 are computed upon the assumption that the two stations, Mount Diablo and Mocho, remained unmoved during the earthquake of April 18; 1906. The reasons why this assumption is believed to be true will be set forth fully in a later part of. this paper. In the tables the points are separated into seven groups for convenience of discussion. Each group of points is fixed by a portion of the triangulation which may conveniently be considered as a unit in discussing the magnitude of the possible errors of the triangulation. The discussion of the observed displacements and the degree of certainty in regard to them is given after the tables and deals with each group in succession.

The apparent "displacements, as shown in the above tables, art; of course in part due to the unavoidable errors in the triangulation and in part are doubtless actual displacements of the points. The triangulation furnishes within itself the means of estimating its accuracy. If the observations were absolutely exact, the sum of the observed angles of each triangle would be exactly· 180° plus the spherical excess of that triangle, and moreover the computation of the length of the triangle sides would shpw no discrepancies, starting from a given line and ending on a selected line, but proceeding through the various alternative sets of triangles which it is possible to select connecting said lines. In any actual case neither of these ideal conditions is found. Each triangle has a closing error, and the lengths computed along different paths through the triangulation show discrepancies. These closing errors and discrepancies are a measure of the accuracy of the triangulation. The triangulation, both old and new, was adjusted by the method of least squares. fhis method of computation, as applied to triangulation, takes into account simultaneously all the observed facts in connection with a group of triangulation stations and also all the known theoretical cdnditions connecting the observed facts, such, for exam-. pie, as those mentioned in the preceding paragraph in regard to closures of triangles and discrepancies in lengt~. It is the most perfect method of computation known. The results of the computation are a set of lengths and azimuths (true directions) of lines joining the triangulation stations and of latitudes and longitudes denning the relative positions of the stations which are perfectly consistent, that is, contain no con. tradictions one with another, and are the most probable values which can be derived from .the observations. In such a computation the measures of the accuracy of the computed results appear in the form of corrections to observed directions from station to station, which it is necessary to apply in order to obtain the most probable results given by the computation. The greater the accuracy of the observations the smaller are the corrections to directions. In the problem in hand, in which at least for some points the observed apparent displacement is of about the same magnitude as the possible error in the apparent dis-· placement due to accumulated errors of observation, it is necessary to make a careful estimate of the errors of observation and of the uncertainties of the computed displacements. This has been done "and the estimates are given in general terms in the following text and are indicated in the last colurµn of the tables. These estimates will help the reader to avoid drawing conclusions in detail not warranted by the facts.
GROUP I. NORTHERN PART OF PRIMARY TRIANGULATION.

In this group, as shown by Tables 1 2, and 3 (see also map 1), there are II points of which the positions were redetermined after the earthquake of April I8, I9o6. Of these, 9 had been determined before I868 and 7 between 1868 and 1906. There is about one chance in three that each of the two apparent displacements of Rocky Mound, 0.50 meter (1.6 feet), in 1868 (Table 2), and 0.34 meter (1. 1 feet), in I906 (Table 1) is simply the result of errors of observation. Similarly there is about one chance in three that the apparent displacement of Red Hill in 1868, 0.65 meter (2.1 feet), is the result of errors of observation. The chances are about even for and against the apparent displacement of Red Hill in 1906 0.30 meter (1 foot), being simply the result. of errors of observation. The effect of errors of observation upon the appar1 1 1

ent displacements ~re larger at these two points than they otherwise would be on account of the difficulty in this vicinity of separating the triangulation into two complete schemes, one before 1868 and one after that date, each strong and complete. According to the evidence furnished by the triangulation, the apparent displacement of Ross Mountain in 1906, 0.53 meter (1.8 feet), in azimuth 309° (51° E. of S.), is probably the result of errors of observation. This apparent displacement as computed depends on the accumulated errors of the two triangulations from Mount Diablo to Ross Mountain, a distance of 130 kilometers (81 miles). The apparent displacement of 0.53 meter almost directly toward Mount Diablo corresponds to a shortening on the line Ross Mountain-Mount Diablo by one part in 250 ooo, too small a change to be detected with certainty by the triangulation. On the other hand, there is about one chance in fifteen that the apparent displacement of Ross Mountain in 1868, 1.70 meters (5.6 feet), is due to errors of observation. It is reasonably certain that this is a real displacement. · The chances are about even for and against the apparent displacement of Point .Reyes Light-house in 1906, 1.09 meters (3.6 feet), being due simply to errors of observation. There is about one chance in seven that the apparent displacement of Bodega, shown in Table 3, is due to errors of observatio~. It is reasonably certain that this is a real displacement . . For the remaining six points in group I, Sierra Morena, Mount Tamalpais, Farallon Light-house, Point Reyes Hill, 'fomales Bay, and Sonoma Mountain, each of the· apparent displacements given in the tables as observed is real, being in each case clearly beyond the maximum which could be accounted for as due to errors of observation. Prof. George Davidson has believed for many years that Mount Tamalpais moved during the earthquake of 1868, and that the triangulations made before and after that date showed such a displacement. Accordingly in 1905, at his request, a reexaminat.ion :-vas made at the Coast and Geodetic Survey office of the evidence furnished by the triangulations, and the conclusion was reached that a real displacement of Mount Tamalpais occurred in 1868. At that time, however, convincing evidence was not discovered that any other triangulation station moved in 1868. In the more extensive studies made in connection with the present investigation, and with the additional skill acquired in recognizing the effects of earth quakes upon triangulation, it became evident, as shown in Table 2, not only that Mount Tamalpais moved in 1868, but also that the Farallon Light-house and Ross Mountain moved at that time, the three apparent displacements being clearly beyond the range of possible errors of triangulation. The displacements for these three stations are similar. 1'he amount of the displacement is least at Farallon Light-house, 1.39 meters (4.6 feet), and greatest at Ross Mountain, 1.70 meters (5.6 feet). The azimuth of the displacement is least at the Farallon Lighthouse, 153° (27° W. of N.), and is greatest at Ross Mountain, 182° (2° E. of N.). (See map 1.) The apparent differences in direction and amount of the three displacements may or may not be real. It is certain, therefore, that in 1868 the large part of the earth's surface included between these three stations, at least 700 square miles, moved about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet), about in azimuth 168° (12° W. of N.). Within the triangle defined by the three stations, Mount Tamalpais, Farallon Light-house, antl Ross Mountain, which certairlly were displaced in 1868, are the

three stations, Point Reyes Hill, Tomales Bay, and Bodega, of group 1. It is therefore believed to be reasonably certain that these stations were displaced at that time. The probable displacements were interpolated from the three displacements observed at the first three stations, taking into account the relative positions of the stations. The resulting interpolated displacements are shown in Table 2. Other evidence tends t,o show that these interpolated values of the displacements are real. For the three stations, Point Reyes Hill, Tomales Bay, and Bodega, the positions were determined before 1868 and after the earthquake of 1906, but not during the interval 1868-1906, hence the computation of the positions determined by triangulation for these stations furnishes simply the combined displacements of 1868 and 1906, as shown in Table 3. As noted in the preceding paragraph, the displacement of l 868 has, for these three stations, been interpolated from surrounding stations and entered in Table 2. The differences* bet ween these inferred displacements in Table 2 and the observed combined displacements in Table 3 were then taken and are shown in Table 1, as inferred displacements in 1906. As indicated in the marked column of Table 1, these inferred displacements are believed to be certain for two of these points, and somewhat doubtful for the ·third, Bodega. The doubtful apparent displacements at Rocky Mound and Red Hill in 1868 (see Table 2) agree with other displacements which are certain, in having a decided northward component. In Table 1, showing the displacements of 1906, there are three stations, Sierra Morena, Mount Tamalpais, and Farallon Light-house, at which the observed displacement is certain, and two others, Point Reyes Hill and Tomales Bay, in group 1, at which the displacement inferred from indirec.t evidence is considered certain. Of these five stations, the four which are to the westward of the fault of 1906 moved to northwestward, and the one which is to the eastward of the fault, Mount Tamalpais, moved southeastward. (See map l .) The displacements of four of the five points were nearly parallel, their azimuths being for Sierra Morena, Point Reyes Hill, and Tomales Bay, 136°, 143°, and 142°, respectively, with a mean of 140° (40° W. of N.), while that of Mount Tamalpais was 324° (36° E. of S.). The azimuth of the displacement at the fifth, Farallon Light-house, is 118° (62° W. of N.), at an angle of about 22° with the other four. The portion of the fault near these points has an azimuth of about 145° (35° W. of N .) , hence the displacement of four of the five points was practically parallel to the fault, the departure being in each case within the range of possible error of the determination of, the displacement. For the four points to the westward of the fault, the amounts of the displacement are in the inverse order of their distances from the fault, with the exception of Sierra Morena. For Tomales Bay, which is only 2.1 kilometers (1.3 miles) from the fault, the displa9ement is greatest, 3.89 meters (12.8 feet), and for the Farallon Light-house, whkh is 37 kilometers (23 miles) from the fault, the displacement is much less, 1.78 meters (5.8 feet). From these five stations, one may deduce four laws governing the distribution of the earth movement which occurred on April 18, 1906. First, points on opposite sides of the fault moved in opposite directions, those to the eastward of the fault in a

southerly direction, and those to the westward in a northerly direction. Second, the . displacements of all points were approximately parallel to the fault. Third, the displacements on each side of the fault were less the greater the distance of the displaced points from the fault. Fourth, for points on opposite sides of the fault and the same distance from it, those. on the western side were displaced. on an average about twice as much as those on the eastern side. ' If the proof of these four deduced laws rested upon the evidence of these five stations only, it would be insufficient to convince one. Much other evidence in proof of these four deduced laws will be shown in this paper. The laws are here stated, in order that they may be kept in mind and tested by the evidence as presented. The apparent displacements of the remaining five points of group 1 may now be compared with the stated laws. The displacement of Point Reyes Light-house, believed to be determined with reasonable certainty, is apparently about 1 .6 meters (5 feet) greater than, and differs about 32° in direction from the displacement which might be inferred from the. above laws and from comparison with the surrounding stations. The displacement of Bodega, of which the determination is somewhat doubtful, is just what would be inferred from the deduced laws, as its amount is greater than for Mount Tamalpais, corresponding to the fact that it is closer to the fault, and its azimuth agrees within 2° with that of the fault. The displacement of Ross Mountain, of which the determination is doubtful, agrees very closely in amount with that at Mount. Tamalpais, and differs only 15° in direction. Ross Mountain is on the same side of the fault as Mount Tamalpais, and at practically the same ·distance from it. The apparent displacements of Rocky Mound and Red Hill, 32 and 19 kilometers (20 and 12 miles) from the fault and to the eastward of it, of which the determinations are doubtful, agree with the laws in being small, but are contradictory as to direction. For Sonoma Mountain the triangulation serves to determine the combined displacements of 1868 and 1906, as shown in Table 3, but not the separate displacements, as this station was not involved in triangulation done between 1868 and 1906. The combined displacements at Sonoma Mountain are of about the same amount and are in approximately the same azimuth as the displacements of 1868 at Mount Tamalpais, Point Reyes Hill, Tomales Bay, Bodega, and Ross Mountain (see Table 2). Some of the. internal evidence of computations of triangulation indicate that Sonoma Mountain moved in 1868. According to the general laws of distribution of the earth movement of 1906, as derived from other stations, Sonoma Mountain did not move much, if any, being far to the eastward of the fault, 34 kilometers (21 miles). For these three reasons it is believed to be probable that the whole displacement of Sonoma Mountain, 1.24 meters (4 feet), in azimuth 183° (3° E. of N.), which certainly took place some time between 1860 and July, 1906, all occurred in 1868.
GROUP 2. SOUTHERN END OF SAN FRANCISCO BAY.

In this group there are three new points not yet considered, and Red Hill, which has already been considered in group 1. The three new stations, Guano Island, Pulgas East Base, and Pulgas West Base (see map 1), were determined in 1851-1854 and again after the earthquake of 1906. No determination· was made between 1868 and 1906,

APPENDIX 3.

:MOVEMENTS IN TH.E CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE.

83

hence these points· are entered in Table 3, the combined displacements of 1868 and 1906 being determined, but not the separate displacements. A study of the errors of the triangulation shows that the apparent displacement of Guano Island, 0.21 meter (0.7 foot), is probably due to errors of observation, and that there is one chance in three that the ·apparent displacement of Pulgas East Base, 0-41 meter (1.3 feet), is also due to errors of observation. The determination of the displacement of Pulgas West Base, 0.74 meter (2.4 feet), is reasonably certain, there being about one chance in twelve that it is due to errors of observation. Though the determinations of the separate apparent displacements of Red Hill in 1868, 0.65 meter (2.1 feet), and in 1906, 0.30 meter (1 foot), are each doubtful, the combined displacement as observed, shown in Table 3, 0.94 meter (3. 1 feet), is certain. It is therefore reasonably certain that there was a relative displacement of Pulgas West Base and Red Hill, as indicated in Table 3, Red Hill moving 0.94 meter (3.1 feet), in azimuth 227° (47° E. of N.), and Pulgas West Base, 0.74 meter (2.4 feet), in azimuth 344° (16° E. of S.). This lengthened the line Pulgas West Base to Red Hill, 16 kilometers (10 miles) long, 0.50 meter (1.6 feet), or one part in 32 ooo. It also changed the azimuth of this line by 11 ", from 240° 44' 35" to 240° 44' 24", rotating it in a counterclockwise direction. The red arrows on map 1 showing apparent displacements indicate that the apparent displacements of Guano Island and Pulgas East Base, which are considered doubtful, are not inconsistent with the displacements of Red Hill and Pulgas West Base. Apparently the area included between these four stations was distorted by stretching and rotated in a counter-clockwise direction. There is no evident method of ascertaining whether the displacement of Pulgas West Base took place in 1868 or 1906 or in part "at each time. The displacement is nearly in the direction corresponding to the laws governing the displacements of 1906, as already stated in connection with group 1.. Pulgas West Base is to the eastward of the fault of 1906 and slightly nearer to it than Mount Tamalpais and Ross Mountain, and hence, according to the laws referred to, should be displaced in the same direction as these two points (see Table 1), and by a similar amount. This is the fact.
GROUP

3.

VIClNl'I'Y OF COLMA.

There are nine points in group 3 all determined by triangulation in 1899 or earlier, and redetermined after the earthquake of 1906 (see Table 1). The earlier determination was made by secondary and tertiary triangulation, extending from the vicinity of Pulgas Base northwest, spanning San Francisco Bay to the Golden Gate, and thence southward to Colma. The earlier positions of these nine points are subject to the effect of accumulated errors in this chain of triangulation about 60 kilometers (40 miles) long. They are subject therefore to an error of position common to them all which may be as great as 7 meters (23 feet). With the exception of Montara Mountain Peak and Bonita Point Light-house these points are all within 13 kilometers (8 miles) of San Bruno Mountain, and therefore their relative positions were determined with considerable accuracy. In the triangulation of 1906-7, the position of San Bruno Mountain, which is in the midst of this group, was determined by secondary triangulation in connection with

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

group 2, as indicated on maps 1 and 2, a direct and strong determination. The new azimuth was also carried into the triangulation of group 3 with a high degree of accuracy in this same manner. No new determination was made of the starting length in group 3. It was assumed that the length San Bruno Mountain to Blacl<: Ridge 2 had remained. unchanged during the earthquake of 1906, and the old value of that length was used in the computation of the triangulation of 1906-7. As a check upon the assumption that this length remained unchanged, it is tb be noted that the azimuths of this line before and after the earthquake of 1906 were found to differ only by 9".3, which is within the possible range of errors of observation in the earlier triangulation. For the reasons stated above, the apparent absolute displacements shown in Table 1 for group 3, as referred to Mocho and Mount Diablo as fixed points, are probably due to errors of observation. On account, however, of the fact that seven of the nine points in this group a·re within a rather small area, their relative displacements are determined with considerable accuracy, the errors of length and azimuth having less effect in producing errors in relative positions, the smaller the area cov.ered by a triangulation. Montara Mountain Peak and Bonita Point Light-house are each determined with a low grade of accuracy. They are each far from the stations occupied in the triangulation and the lines which determine them intersect at a small angle, hence even their relative displacements are uncertain. The relative displacements observed for the remaining seven points after omitting these two are certain, being beyond the possible range of errors of observation. The apparent absolute displacements for this group of points (see Table 1 and map 2), indicate that all points on the eastern side of the fault moved in a southerly direction, and thos'e on the western side in a northerly direction; that the displacements tend to be parallel to the fault, the more doubtful displacements showing the greater angles with the fault, and that the amounts of the displacement are in the inverse order of the distances of the stations from the fault, with two exceptions. These exceptions are San Pedro Rock, of which the relative displacement is determined with sufficient accuracy to establish this as a real exception, and Bonita Point Light-house, for which the apparent displacement as observed is so uncertain that this apparent exception has but little significance. Of the four points, all on the western side of the fault, of which the relative displacements are believed to be certain, as indicated in Table 1, the azimuths of the displacements vary from 151° to 169°, with a mean of 157° (23°.w. of N.). The azimuth of the fault in this vicinity is 144° (36° W. of N.). The relative displacements on opposite sides of the fault and near to it are less in this group (2 to 3 meters) than for points at a similar distance from the fault in group 1, namely, Point Reyes Hill, Tamales Bay, and Bodega (5 to 6 meters).
GROUP

4·

TOMALES BAY.

There are seven points in this group (see Tables 1 to 3 and maps 1 and 2). These were fixed in 1856-1860 by tertiary triangulation extending southeastward along Tomales Bay from stations Tomales Bay and Bodega of group 1. They were fixed again in practically the same manner in 1906 after the earthquake. With these seven points may advantageously be considered the three points, Point Reyes Hill, Tamales Bay, and Bodega, which were fixed in group 1. No one of these ten points was determined between 1868 and 1906, hence the observations served· to determine the combined displacements of 1868 and 1906, as

APPENDIX 3.

85

shown in Table 3, but not the separate displacements. The separate displacements have bee~ determined by interpoiation from surrounding stations for the three points, Point Reyes Hill, Tomales Bay, and Bodega, as indicated in the discussion of group 1. The same process has also been applied to the seven points of group 4. Starting with the interpolated displacements of 1868 for the three points, Point Reyes Hill, Tomales Bay, and. Bodega, as shown in Table 2, and with map 2 before one, it was a simple matter to interpolate separately the meridian components and the prime vertical components of the displacements of 1868 for the seven stations of grnup 4. This amounts practically to interpolating the displacements for these points from the three observed displacements of 1868 at Mount Tamalpais, Farallon Light-house, and Ross Mountain. The resulting interpolated displacements of 1868 are shown in Table 2. Each of these being subtracted, component by component, from the corresponding combined displacement of 1868 and 1906, as shown in Table 3, leaves the displacement of 1906 as shown in Table I. A study of the possible accumulated errors in the triangulations shows that all of the seven displacements of 1906 in group 2 are certain except for Hans and Hammond. There is about one chance in five that the apparent displacements of 1906 for these two points are simply due to errors of observation. The ten displacements of I906 in this group show clearly the four laws already suggested in regard to such displacements. All points to the eastward of the fault moved southerly, and those of the western side northerly. Four of the five points to the westward of the fault moved in azimuths between 141° and 143° with a mean of 142° (38° W. of N.). The azimuth of this part of the fault is about 145° (35° W. of N.). The azimuth of the fifth displacement on the west side, at Bodega Head, is I72° (8° W of N.). The azimuths of the three reasonably certain displacements of points to the eastward of the fault vary from 323° to 348° with a mean of 334° (26° E. of S.), which is within 9° of being parallel to the fault. Of the five points to the westward of the fault, the,pne nearest to the fault, Foster, has the greatest displacement. The other four, all be~ween 2 and 2.7 kilometers from the fault, have nearly equal displacements. The five di.~placements for points to the eastward of the fault show a slight tendency to stand in inverse order f~om the distances from the fault. But one only of these displacements differs by more than 0.42 meter (1.4 feet) from the mean of the five, and the estimated distances from the fault vary only from 0.5 to 2.6 kilometers. When the uncertainty of the position of the fault beneath Tomales Bay is considered, as well as the small variation in distance of these ten points from the faul~, difficulties are to be expected in detecting the relation between displacement and distance from the fault in this group. The mean displacement of the points to the eastward of the fault is I .86 meters (6.1 feet) and of the five points to the westward 2.1 times as much, namely, 3.88 meters (12.7 feet). GROUP 5· VICINITY OF FORT ROSS. There are twelve points in this group, all determined by secondary triangulation in
1875-76 and again in 1906, the scheme of triangulation being in each case substantially

the same as that shown on map 2. The base from which these positions are determined is not independent of observations made before 1868, but is obtained by making the observations preceding that date conform to those made between I 868 and 1906. From the small size of the necessary corrections to the observed angles, and from the fact that

86

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, r907.

the position of Ross Mountain, which predominates the group, is determined by observations made entirely after r 868, the error of assuming that these twelve points belong to the period between 1868 and 1906 is deemed negligible. For one point, Chaparral, observations made in 1860 furnish a determination of the position before 1868, and hence the displacement of this point in 1868 (see Table 2) is determined as well as its displacement in l 906. The displacement of 1868 agrees closely, within less than 0.13 meter (0.4 feet) in amount and 9° in direction, with the displacement at that ti.me at Ross Mountain, 5.7 kilometers (3.5 miles) to the eastward. A study of the possible accumulated errors in the triangulation shows that five of the _observed displacements in this group, as referred to Mocho and Mount Diablo, are clearly beyond the range of possible errors of observation, namely, those at Fort Ross, Funcke, Timber Cove, Stockhoff, and Pinnacle Rock. For the remaining seven displacements there are from one to two chances out of ten that they are due entirely to errors of observation and these displacements are therefore reasonably certain. The relative displacements of pairs of points on opposite sides of the fault and near to each other in this group are certain, being in every case clearly beyond the range of possible errors of observation. The apparent displacements in 1906 of the twelve points in this group conform closely to the four deduced laws governing such displacements. The seven points to the westward of the fault moved in a northerly direction, in azimuth varying from 137° to 158°, with a mean of 144° (36° W. of N.). The azimuth of the fault in this region is about 141° (39° W. of N .) . All five points to the eastward of the fault moved southerly, in azimuth varying from 301° to 328°, with a mean of 318° (42° E. of S.). All of the points in this group are within 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) of the fault and therefore give little opportunity to ascertain whether the amounts of the displacements show any relation to distances from the fault. Such a relation is not clearly discernible among the observed displacements. The evidence of the apparent displacement at Ross Mountain (see Table 1), 6.2 kilometers (4.2 mites) to the eastward of the fault, indicates a decrease of displacement with increase of distance from the fault in that direction. The average displacement of the five points to the eastward of the fault is I.44 meters (4.7 feet) and of the seven points to the westward is 1.5 times as great, namely, 2. II meters (6.9 feet).
GROUP

6.

POINT AR~N A.

In this group there are ten points determined by secondary triangulation in 1870 to 1892 that were redetermined by secondary triangulation in 1906, starting from the stations Fisher and Cold Spring, 11.2 and 13.5 kilometers eastward from the fault, respectively (see map 2). A study of the possible errors in the triangulation shows that all of the observed displacements in this group are certain, each being clearly greater than the maximum possible errors of observation. There is a possibility that the assumption that the two stations, Fisher and Cold Spring, remained unmoved in 1906 is in error. The movement, if any, of these stations was probably about the same for both stations and in a southerly direction and parallel to the fault. If such a movement of these stations occurred the computed displacements in 1906, shown in Table 1 and on map 2, are all too small for stations to the eastward of the fault and too great for stations to the westward of it.

APPENDIX 3.

MOVEMENTS IN THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE.

87

The agreement of the observed displacements of the ten points in this group with the four deduced laws is close. The six points to the westward of the fault moved in azimuths varying through a range of 5° only, from 159° to 164°, with a mean of 162° (18° W. of N.). The fault in this vicinity is said to change in azimuth, near the point where it crosses the coast line, from about 144° to about 164° (16° W. of N.), curving to the eastward. The four points to the eastward of the fault moved in azimuths varying from 324° to 340° with a mean of 330° (30° E. of S.). The station Shoemake, comparatively near to the fault, 1.5 kilometers (0.9 mil'e), on the west side, showed a displacement much larger than any of the other five points on that side, all of which are from 5.7 to 7.6 kilometers from the fault. The two points to the eastward of the fault, which are within less than one kilometer of it, were displaced nearly twice as much as the other two; which are nearly four kilometers from the fault. The average displacement for the four points to the eastward of the fault is z.16 meters (3.8 feet) and for the six to the westward is 2.3 times as great, namely, 2.71 meters (8.9 feet).
GROUP

7.

SOUTHERN PART OF PRIMARY TRIANGULATION.

In this group, extending southward from the line Mocho-Sierra Morena, there are nine points (see map 1) of which the positions were redetermined after the earthquake of 1906. Of these, one, Loma Prieta, had been formerly determined both before and after the earthquake of 1868, five o,thers had been determined before 1868, but not after, and three had been determined after, but not before 1868. (See Tables l to 3.) In this group, therefore, but one point is available to show the displacem~nt of 1868. The triangulation of 1854-55, starting from the line Ridge to Rocky Mound near the Pulgas Base, consisted of a single chain of triangles with all angles measured, down to the line Loma Prieta-Gavilan. The Point Pinos Light-house and the Point Pinos Latitude Station were connected with this chain, with checks, by observations in 1854,
1864, an~ 1866.

The main triangulation of 1876-1887, from the line Mount Diablo-Mocho to the line Mount Toro-Santa Ana, consisted of a strong chain of figures with many checks being substantially as shown on map l if Gavilan be omitted and all stations occupied. In this triangulation, however, no complete independent determinations with checks, were made of Black Mountain, Santa Cruz Azimuth Station, Gavilan, Point Pinos Light-house, and Point Pinos Latitude Station. The triangulation of 1906-7 was made as shown on map I. Two separate leastsquare adjustments were made of the main scheme connecting the points Mount Diablo, Mocho, Sierra Morena, Loma Prieta, Mount Toro, Gavilan, and Santa Ana. In the first adjustment it was assumed, as for the computations of other groups, that Mount Diablo and Mocho only remained unmoved during the earthquake of 1906. This first adjustment showed an apparent displacement of Santa Ana in 1906 of 3.26 meters (10.7 feet), in azimuth 288° (72° E. of S.), but an examination in detail of the possible accumulated errors in the triangulation showed that this apparent displacement w~ probably due to errors of observation. The new primary triangulation is much weaker in the figure defined by the five points, Mocho, Loma Prieta, Mount Toro, Gavilan, and Santa Ana, than elsewhere for two reasons. First, the length must be carried without a check through the triangle Loma Prieta, Mocho, Mount Toro, of which only two angles were measured and which is very unfavorable in shape for an

88

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

accurate determination of length. Second, it so happened that the least accurate observations made in the primary triangulation were in this triangle or in its immediate vicinity. In the second and adopted adjustment it was assumed that Santa Ana, as well as Mount Diablo and Mocho, remained unmoved during the earthquake of 1906. The astronomic azimuth had been observed at Mount Toro in 1885 and again after the earthquake of l 906. These two determinations measured the absolute change in azimuth of the line between Mount Toro and Santa Ana, and indicated it to be 2".5, the· later azimuth being the greater. This was utilized to strengthen the adjustment. In view of the evidence of ·stations farther north, the assumption that Santa Ana remained unmoved is reasonably safe. Santa Ana is about 27 kilometers (17 miles) to the eastward from the point at which the fault disappeared near the village of San Juan. There is no station anywhere in the triangulation more than 6.4 kilometers to the eastward of the fault for which any displacement in 1906 was determined with certainty. If Santa Ana was displaced in 1906 the erroneous assumption introduces an error into the computed displacements at the stations Gavilan, Mount Toro, Point Pinos Light-house, and Point Pinos Latitude Station of about the same amount as the actual displacement at Santa Ana. The error produced in the computed displacement at Santa Cruz Light-house and Santa Cruz Azimuth Station must be much smaller, and no error would bt! produced at Loma Prieta. Taking the uncertainty in regard to the estimated stability of Santa Ana into account, as well as the possible errors in the triangulation, the following estimates of the uncertainties of the apparent displacements were made. The displacements of Loma Prieta in 1906 and 1868 (see Tables l and 2) are both certain. The displacements of Black Mountain, Santa Cruz Azimuth Station, Gavilan, Point Pinos Light-house, and Point Pinos Latitude Station, as shown in Table 3, are also certain. These are all combined displacements of 1868 and 1906. These stations were not determined between 1868 and 1906, hence it is not possible to determine directly from th~ observations the separate displacements. If it be assumed that the displacements in 1868 of the last four of these points were the same as that observed· for Loma Prieta (see Table 2), then the inferred displacements for each of these points in 1906 is as shown at the end of Table 1. These inferred displacements for these points are, however, very doubtfu( as they depend upon a determination of the displacement· of 1868 at a single point, Loma Prieta, which is 24 kilometers (15 miles) from Santa Cruz Azimuth Station and more than 48 kilometers (30 miles) from each of the other stations. It should be noted, also, that the displacement of Loma Prieta in 1868, which is certain, is very different from that of the other four points, Mount Tamalpais, Farallon Light-house, Chaparral, and Ross Mountain, for which the displacem~l\ts of 1868 have been determined directly by observations. It is a displacement to the southward instead of to the northwestward, and is much larger than for the other three points. The determination of the displacement of Mount Toro as shown in Table 1 is somewhat uncertain. There is still more uncertainty in regard to the apparent displacement at Santa Cruz Light-house.

The very small app.arent displacement, 0.12 meter (0.4 foot), of the Lick Observatory small dome in 1906 is probably due to errors of observation. The two points in this group to the eastward of the"fault show apparent displacements in 1906 in accordance with the laws deduced from other groups, Lick Observatory, far fro~ the fault, 36 kilometers (22 miles), having an apparent displacement so small as to be uncertain, and Loma P.rieta, within 4.8 kilometers (3.0 miles) of the fault, having an apparent displacement of 0.97 meter (3.2 feet) in a southerly di~ection and within 9 0 of being parallel to the fault, which here has an azimuth of about 312° (48° E. of S.). Mount Toro is the only station to the westward of the fault in this group for which a determination of the displacement of 1906 is not very doubtful. The displacement in 1906 of 0.95 meter (3.1 feet) at Mount Toro is in a nortl1erly direction with a slight inclination to the westward in fair agreement with the deduced laws. Mount Toro is beyond the end of the portion of the great fault of 1906 which has been traced on the surface. The apparent displacement of Santa Cruz Light-house in 1906, of which the determination is doubtful, is closely parallel to the fault and in a northerly direction, corresponding to other points to the westward of the fault. The inferred displacement of 1906 for four points shown at the e!Jd of Table l are all very doubtful, and little significance should be attached to them or to the fact that they are somewhat contradictory to each other and all have a southerly tendency, whereas all other points to the westward of the fault of 1 906 moved in a northerly direction. As a check on this conclusion it should be noted that the inferred displacement for 1906 for . Santa Cruz Azimuth Station differs by 72° in direction and· 1.26 meters (4.1 feet) in amount from the observed displacement of 1906 for Santa Cruz Light-house, a point only 3.9 kilometers (2.4. miles) away. The observed displacement for Santa Cruz Lighthouse is much less uncertain than the inferred displacement for Santa Cruz Azimuth Station, and hence the contradiction throws additional doubt on the latter and the other three points for which the inference is made in like manner. Though the inferred displacements of these four points for 1906 are all very doubtful, the observed combined displacements of 1868 and 1906 for these four points, as shown in Table 3, are all certain, being clearly beyond the possible range of errors of observation. So, also, are the combined displacements of 1868 and 1906 for Loma Prieta and Black Mountain. It appears, then, that the combined effects of the earthquakes of 1868 and 1906 were to move the whole region from Black Mountain to Point Pinos to the southeastward by from 2.11 to 5.89 meters (6.9 to 19.3 feet). The mean azimuth of these six displacements is 321° (39° E. of S.). The most startling evidence of the combined effects of the two earthquakes is the increase of 3 meters (10 feet) in the width of Monterey Bay from Santa. Cruz Azimuth Station to Point Pinos Light-house, both of these points hav~ ing moved in a southerly direction, but the latter much more than the former. The length of the line Santa Cruz Azimuth Station to Point Pinos Light-house is only 39.8 kilometers (24.7 miles); the increase is therefore one part in 13 ooo. Not much significance should be attached to the fact that Point Pinos Latitude Station has apparently moved 1 meter less than Point Pinos Light-house. This 1 meter is the difference of the combined displacements of two earthquakes. It is subject to the errors of observation in two determinations of each point by triangulation

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907·

in somewhat different ways. Moreover, the determination of the position of Point Pinos Latitude Station after the earthquake of 1906 was made without a check. It is for this reason that the displacement at Point Pinos Light-house is considered to be the more reliable determination of the two.
DISTRIBUTION OF EARTH MOVEMENT: SUMMARY.

In reaching the conclusions stated below, the evidence has been studied much more in detail than it has been given in the preceding pages. The conclusions are based on both the positive and negative evidence. The positive ·evidence is given by the displacements marked "certain" or "reasonably certain" in Tables 1, 2, and 3. The negative evidence is given by displacements marked "doubtful," of which Rocky Mound is an example. At this point the observed apparent displacement of 1906 was only 0.34 meter (1. 1 feet). The accuracy of the triangulation is such that it is practically certain that any displacement of this station as great as 1 meter would be detected. Hence the evidence given by this station is that the displacement, if any, was less than 1 meter and probably was less than 0.3 meter. Maps 1 and 2 should be consulted while reading the following conclusions: During an earthquake in 1868, or about that time, about l ooo square miles of the earth's crust, comprised between the four stations, Mount Tamalpais, Farallon Lighthouse, Ross Mountain, and Chaparral, were permanently displaced to the northward about 1.6 meters (5.2 feet), in azimuth 169° (11° W. of N.). The indications are that this whole area moved as a block without distortion or rotation; at least the triangulation furnishes no evidence competent to prove either distortion or rotation of the block (about a vertical axis), or to locate accurately any boundary of the block. It is probable that the block included Sonoma Mountain. It is reasonably certain that Rocky Mound and the group of points near the southern end of San Francisco Bay, Red Hill, Pulgas Base stations, and Guano Island were not on this block, though they were probably displaced somewhat irregularly during the earthquake of 1868. During the earthquake of 1868, or about that time, Loma Prieta was permanently displaced about 3.03 meters (9.9 feet), in azimuth 307° (53° E. of S.) This displacement is in a direction at an angle of 138° with that of the displacements of the same date referred to in the preceding paragraph. Loma Prieta moved to the southeastward, whereas Mount Diablo, Farallon Light~house, Ross Mountain, and Chaparral moved to the northward. It is reasonably certain that Santa Cruz Azimuth Station, Point Pinos Light-house, Point Pinos Latitude Station, and Gavilan were similarly displaced. It is probable that the last three stations named were displaced to the southeastward in 1868, being about 3 meters (IO feet) more than Santa Cruz Azimuth Station and Loma Prieta, and consequently the width of Monterey Bay was increased then by about one part .in 13 ooo. The combined effects of the earthquakes of 1868 and 1906 have increased the distance between Mount Tamalpais and Black Mountain (see map 1 and Table 3) by 3 meters (10 feet). The distance is 79 kilometers (49 miles) and ~he increase is therefore one part in 26 ooo. The Golden Gate lies between these two stations. It is interesting to note that the length of part of the Pacific Coast, including the Golden Gate, has been increased just as the distance across Monterey B·ay has been increased.

During the earthquake of April 18, 1906, displaced points on opposite sides of the great fault accompanying the earthquake moved in opposite directions, those to the eastward of the fault in a southerly and those to the westward in a northerly direction. Among all the points there are but two apparent exceptions to this rule, namely, Rocky Mound and Red Hill. For both these stations the apparent exceptional movement is so small as to be.probably due simply to errors of observation, and therefore they are not significant. · During the earthquake of 1906 the permanent displacements of all disturbed points were approximately parallel to the fault. When the difficulties encountered in determining the direction of these displacements are considered, it is remarkable that the observed displacements follow this law so accurately as they do. The nearest fixed points to which each displaced point is referred are from 30 to 140 kilometers distant (20 to 90 miles). The total displacements are from 0.5 to 4.6 meters (2 to 15 feet). Among all the points examined, there are but five for which the apparent changes in distance from the fault are not so small as to be probably due to errors of observation. The Farallon Light-house apparently moved at an angle of about 27° with the fault, and its increase in distance from the fault of o.8 meter is reasonably certain. As Mount Tamalpais, nearly opposite to Farallon Light-house across the fault, moved practically parallel to the fault, there was either an opening of the fault beneath the sea in this region or an increase in length of the earth's crust, in a direction at right angles to the fault, of one part in 50 ooo (o.8 meter in 44 kilometers, or 3 feet in 27 miles). Point Reyes Light-house also apparently receded from the fault, moving in about the same direction (within 5") as the Farallon Light-house, but the determination of the displacement of the Point Reyes Light-house is so weak that this ·apparent displacement has little significance. It is reasonably certain that Bodega Head approached the fault from the western side, while Bodega, on the eastern side of the fault, about opposite, moved parallel to the fault. The apparent closing up of the fault or shortening of the crust at right angles to the fault is 1.6 meters (5.2 feet) between these two points, only 5.4 kilometers (3.4 miles) apart. This is one part in 3 400. It is possible that as much as one-half of this apparent closing up is due to errors of observation, but it is reasonably certain that not all of it is due to that cause. Similarly it is reasonably certain that Peaked Hill in the Fort Ross group receded from the fault on the east side and Pinnacle Rock approached it on the west side, the apparent amounts being 0.4 meter (1 .3 feet) and 0.7 meter (2.3 feet), respectively. It is reasonably certain that San Pedro Rock in the Colma group approached the fault from the west side, the apparent amount being 1.1 meter (3.6 feet). During the earthquake of 1906 the displacements on each side of the fault were less the greater the distance of the displaced points from the fault. On the eastern side of the fault, ten points at an average distance of 1.5 kilometers (0.9 mile) from the fault have an average displacement of r.54 meters (5. 1 feet), three points at an average distance of 4.2 kilometers (2.6 miles) have an average displacement of o.86 meter (2.8 feet), and one point, Mount Tamalpais, at 6.4 kilometers (4.0 miles) from the fau)t, has a displacement of 0.58 meter (1.9 feet). These fourteen.points' are the only ones on the eastern side of the fault for which the observed displacements were determined with reasonable certainty. For no point to the eastward of the fault at a greater distance than 6.!1- kilometers (4.0 miles) was any displacement detected with certainty. To

the westward, twelve points at an average distance of 2.0 kilometers (i.2 miles) from the fault have an average displacement of 2.95 meters (9.7 feet). Seven at an average distance of 5.8 kilometers (3.6 miles) have an average displacement of 2.38 meters (7.8 feet). The only pther point to the westward of the fault of which the displa~ement was determined with certainty was Farallon Light-house, distant 37 kilometers (23 miles) and displaced 1.78 meters (5.8 feet). In receding from the fault, either to the eastward or to the westward; the displacement decreases more rapidly near the fault than it does farther from the fault. According to the averages given in the preceding paragraph, the decrease in displacement on the eastern side near the fault is at the rate of 0.25 meter per kilometer (that is, o.68 meter in 2.7 kilometers) and farther away the rate is 0.13 meter per kilometer (that is, 0.28 meter in 2.2 kilometers). Imagine a straight line before the earthquake of April 18, 1906, starting at the fault and extending eastward at right angles to it. According to this investigation, after the earthquake this line became a curved line, concave to the southward, the point at the fault being displaced southward and distant points on the line remaining fixed. Also according to the above figures, the part of the line which is from l .5 to 4.2 kilometers from the fault was deflected from its former direction about 52 seconds and that part from 4.2 to 6.4 kilometers from the fault was deflected about 26 seconds, and the deflection probably decreased gradually to zero at distant points. To the westward of the fault the rate of decrease of displacement, according to the averages in the preceding paragraph, is near the fault o. 15 meter per kilometer (that is, 0.57 meter in 3.8 kilometers) and farther away only 0.02 meter per kilometer (that is, 0.60 meter in 31 kilometers). Accordingly the imaginary straight line at right angles to the fault and extending westward from it has become concave to the northward, the point at the fault being displaced to the northward and very distant points remaining fixed. The deflection from its original direction is about 31 seconds· for the part from 2 to 6 kilometers from the fault and about 4 seconds on an average for the part from 6 to 37 kilometers from the fault. .Of points on opposite sides of the fault of 1906, and at the same distance from it, those on the westward side are displaced on an average twice as much as those on the eastern side. This statement applies especially to points within ro kilometers (6 miles) of the fault. For points farther away the ratio becomes more than two to one. It is important to note. that this statement applies to displacements, not distortions. The distortion, expressed in angular measure, discussed in the preceding paragraph, is nearly the·same on the two sides of the fault, being somewhat less, close to the fault, on the western side than on the eastern side. The amount of relative displacement of the two sides of the fault by sliding along the fault, as detected by the triangulation, shows no variations for different parts of the fault along its whole length from Point Arena to San Juan, with one exception, which are sufficiently large to be clearly not due to errors of observation. This one exception is the region ilear Colma where, as already noted, the relative displacements seem to be unusually small. The permanent displacements and distortions which took place at the time of the earthquake of April 18, 1906, may be pictured by imagining a series of perfect. squares drawn on the surface of the ground before the earthquake, with their sides parallel and perpendicular to the fault. At the time of the earthquake every square to the east-

APPENDIX 3.

MOVEMENTS IN THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE.

93

ward of the fault moved bodily in a southerly direction parallel to the fault, the squares more distant from the fault moving less than those near to it. All sides of squares parallel to the fault remained straight lines, unchanged in length and direction. For the squares to the eastward, the sides perpendicular to the fault became curved lines concave to the southward and changed direction as a whole by rotation in a counterclockwise direction, the change being 52 seconds or more for squares near the fault, and less for more remote squares. The angles of the squares all took new values differing from 90° by quantities ranging from more than 52 seconds to zero. The squares to the westward of the fault were moved bodily in a northerly direction parallel to the fault, their sides parallel to the fault remaining straight and u_nchanged in length and direction. Their sides ·perpendicular to the fault became curved lines concave to the northward and each changed in direction by rotation in a counterclockwise direction, the change being more than 3 l seconds for squares near the fault and less for more remote squares. The displacement of squares near the fault was twice as great for squares on the western side as for squares on the eastern, but the distortion was slightly less for squares on the western side than for those on the eastern side. The appreciable displacements extended back much farther from the fault on the western side than on the eastern side. It is not probable that the actual displacements and distortions were perfectly regular as indicated in the word picture of the preceding paragraph, but the apparent departures from this perfectly regular ideal of the displacements and distortions detected by the triangulation are nearly all so small as to be possibly due to errors of observation. Attention has been called to the few exceptions, of which one can be certain, which have been detected. The earth movements of April 18 1 1906 1 were remarkable for their regularity of distribution. The triangulation of l 906-7 has extended eastward clearly beyond the region of appreciable permanent displacements by the earthquake of 1906. The disturbed region evidently extended to the westward out under the Pacific beyond the possible reach of the triangulation. To the northward of Point Arena there is little probability of much success if art attempt were made to determine additional displacements by triangulation, for the known fault of 1906 touches the coast for but a short distance anywhere north of Point Arena, and triangulation to the northward of Point Arena before the earthquake consisted simply of a narrow and weak belt of tertiary triangulation. It had been intended to extend the triangulation of 1906-7 far enough to the southward to reach outside of the disturbed region. It was supposed until after the observing party left the southern end of the triangulation that this had been accomplished.... but when the additional evidence given by the office computations became available it was evident that the most southern points determined are still within the disturbed region. The fact that the visible evidence of the fault of 1906 does not extend farther southward than San Juan indicates that there are probably few points to the southward of Mount Toro and Point Pinos for which the displacements were large enough to be detected by triangulation.
DISCUSSION OF ASSUMPTIONS.

Certain things have apparently been assumed in this investigation-for example, that appreciable permanent displacements _occurred· during the earthquake of 1868 as

94

COAST AND GEODETIC SVRVEY REPORT, HJ07·

well as during the earthquake of 1906, that the permanent displacements in 1906 occurred suddenly, and that the stations Mocho and Mount Diablo remained unmoved in both earthquakes. These are called apparent assumptions because in a real sense they are not assumptions but are instead facts detected gradually in studying for fifteen months upon a steadily increasing mass of evidence. However, treating them as assumptions, their validity has been reexamined in the light of all the evidence, and to make this report complete it is now necessary to state why they are believed to be true. It has been tacitly assumed that the permanent displacements of 1906, detected by the triangulation, took place suddenly. It is certain from evide'hce entirely distinct from the triangulation that on April 18, 1906, relative displacements by sliding along the great fault of that date took place suddenly, that is, within an interval of a few seconds, without much crushing or separation of the sides of the fault, and that these relative displacements amounted from 2 to 6 meters (7 to 20 feet). These relative displacements were evident at every road, fence, or line of trees crossing the fault, but such evidence does not enable one to ascertain how far back from the fault in each direction the displacement extended. The repetition of the triangulation after the earthquake showed that many points at various distances from the fault had all been displaced parallel to the fault, that the distribution of the displacements is regular, and that for points nearest the fault the relative displacements corresponded in amount to those observed at roads, fences, tree lines, etc., at the fault and which were known to have taken place suddenly. Hence it is certain that the widely distributed displacements shown by the triangulation are a part of the same phenomenon and took place at the same time as the displacements at the fault, that is, suddenly on April 18, 1906. For the displacements credited to the year 1868 in this report the case is different. It had been known from previous examination of the evidence given by triangulation that Mount Tamalpais had moved between 1859 and 1876. In the course of the detailed studies of the triangulation in connection with the present investigation, it was found that other triangulation stations had moved at or about I 868. It was discovered that wherever triangulation in this part of California before I 868 had been connected with triangulation done after 1868, it was necessary., in order to obtain consistent results, to apply abnormally large corrections to the observed angles. By trial it was found that wherever the observations of angles were separated into two groups and separate computations made connecting identical points marked upon the ground, one group comprising observations before 1868 and the other observations after that year, that the corrections necessary to obtain consistent results from each set of angles were much smaller than before, and about the normal size to be expected from the instruments and methods of observation used. The evidence proves that permanent displacements took place at or about 1868 of magnitude which the triangulation could detect with certainty. The particular year in which the displacements took place is not fixed, however, by the triangulation, but simply by the fact that it occurred within the interval of several years which elapsed in each part of the triangulation between the last observation before 1868 and the first observation after that year. For this reason considerable care has been taken in stating the dates of the triangulation for each locality. In 1906 it was known that sudden permanent displacements took place on a certain day, hour, and minute along a great fault line and these displacements were similar to

a

those detected later by triangulation. So far as the writers know, no evidence has been found that such large sudden relative displacements took place in r868 or about that year, but it is known that a very severe earthquake in this region occurred in 1868. Hence the observed displacements, referred in this report to 1868 for the sake of brevity, may have occurred in some other year near r868 and may have occurred by a gradually creeping motion extending over several years. No other abnormal discrepancies in the triangulation within this region are known to exist. If there are such discrepancies produced by displacements of the triangulation stations by earthquakes, they are so small as to be effectually masked by the unavoidable errors of observation. In other words, any other permanent horizontal displacements by earthquakes within this region between 1850 and r907 must have been much smaller than the displacements of r 906 and r 868. It has been assumed that there was no permanent displacement of stations Macho and Mount Diablo during the earthquake of r906. What is the evidence that this assumption is true? The true direction or azimuth from Macho to Mount Diablo was determined by observations upon the stars in x887 and found to be i44° 57' 35".7I. In 1907 it was redetermined by observations upon the stars and found to be 144° 57' 35".66, differing by only o".05 from its former value. The maximum possible difference between the two determinations of azimuth which could occur simply as errors of observation is about r".* Hence these observations show positively that the true direction from Mocha to 1:1ount Diablo had not changed between these dates by as much as r" and probably had not changed by as much as o".3. The true direction or azimuth of the line Mount Tamalpais to Mount Diablo was determined by observations upon the stars in 1882 and again in the same manner in 1907. In 1882 it was found to be 274° 15' 15".04 and in 1907, 274° 15' 14".49, o".55 less than before. The azimuth of the line Mount Tamalpais to Mount Diablo was computed separately from the triangulation between 1868 and 1906 and from the triangulation after the earthquake of 1906, and the two values found to be 274° 15' 19".46 and 274° 15' 17".89, respectively, the second being 1".57 less than the first. This apparent decrease of azimuth as determined by the triangulation agrees within l".02 with the decrease of o".55 determined independently by astronomic observations.t This agreement is within the range of possible errors of observation. In the two computations of the triangulation, the line Mocho-Mount Diablo was assumed to have the same azimuth before and after April 18, 1906, hence the close agreement noted indicates that the azimuth Mocha-Mount Diablo remained unchanged. In the investigation which has been made, it was found that the absolute displacement decreased with increased distance from the fault, and that no displacement suf*The probable error of observed azimuth in 1887 was ±o".21 and in 190; ±o".20. The expression, "probable error," is here used in the technical sense in which it is used in connection with the least square method of computation. t The discrepancy of about 4" on each date between the azimuth determined by astronomic observations and the azimuth determined by triangulation is what is known as "station error" in azimuth and is due to the deflection of the vertical at the observation station. It does not enter into the present discussion, which is based on differences of azimuths o{ the same kind, either astronomic or geodetic, on different dates at the same station,

ficiently large to be detected with certainty was found farther to the eastward of the fault than Mount Tamalpais, 6-4 kilometers (4 miles) from it. Mocho and Mount Diablo are 53 kilometers (33 miles) from the fault, hence it seems certain that the displacements, if any, at Mocho and Mount Diablo must have been extremely small. It may be objected that this is reasoning in a circle, inasmuch as the computed displacements depend upon the assumption that Mocho and :Mount Diablo stood still. Cleared of this objection, the argument reduces to the following: The triangulation shows no relative displacements in 1906, large enough 'to be. determined with certainty, of Mocho, Mount Diablo, Rocky Mound, Red Hill, and Lick Observatory, a group of points far to the eastward of the fault, ~hereas many points nearer to the fault showed large relative displacements as referred to each other with a marked tendency to be greater the nearer to the fault are the groups of points compared. Hence the reasoning is valid that Mocho and Mount Diablo remained unmoved, these being two points in a group showing no displacements relative to each other, the whole group being far from the fault, and these two particular stations being the two points most distant from the fault. If either Mocho or Mount Diablo had moved in April, 1906, in such a direction as to decrease (or increase) the azimuth of the line joining them, the effect of the erroneous assumption, used in the computation of the triangulation done after the earthquake, that the azimuth had remained unchanged, \.'VOuld have been to produce a set of computed apparent displacements which would be represented by red arrows on.map l, all indicating a rotation in a clockwise (or counterclockwise) direction around Mount Diablo, the lengths of the arrows being proportional to their distances from Mocho and Mount Diablo. The fact that the computed apparent displacements of 1906 as shown by the red arrows on maps 1 and 2 do not show any such systematic relation to each other, indicates that the line Mocho-Mount Diablo remained unchanged in azimuth on April 18, 1906. . Similarly, if either Mocho or Mount Diablo had moved on April 18, 1906, in such a direction as to increase (or decrease) the distance between them, the effect upon the computations of apparent displacements would have been to produce a set of red arrows on maps l and 2, all pointing toward (or from) Mocho and Mount Diablo, the lengths of the arrows being proportional to their distances from Mocho and Mo~nt Diablo. No such systematic relation appears among the arrows. Another item of evidence is still available which indicates that the absolute displacement of points far to the eastward of the fault was zero on April 18, 1906. From 1899 to date a series of observations of latitude by observations upon the stars have been in progress continuously for the International Geodetic Association at Ukiah, Cal. The purpose of these observations is to detect variations in latitude due to any cause. The observations are of an extremely high grade of accuracy, and they are made on every clear night. Dr. S. D. Townley, in charge of these observations, made a special study of the 233 observations made during the interval April 4-May 4, inclusive, 1906, to determine whether any sudden change of latitude took place on April 18.*. He found no such change. The observations are competent to ~etermine with reasonable certainty any change as great as o".03, corresponding to 1 meter (3 feet). It is
*This investigation is published in the "Publications of the Astronomic Society of the Pacific," Vol. XVIII, No. 109, August 10, 1906, under the title "The Latitude of the Ukiah Observatory before and after April 18, 1906."

therefore reasonably certain that the southward component of the motion, if any, of the pier on which Doctor Townley's latitude instrument was mounted at Ukiah was less than 1 meter on April 18, 1906. Ukiah is about 42 kilometers (26 miles) from the fault and to the eastward of it. Mocho and Mount Diablo are much farther from the fault (53 kilometers). It is important to note that the latitude observations determined the absolute displace.ment rather than the relative displacement, and that they are independent of observations at any other station. For the reasons set forth above, it is believed to be certain that the permanent displacement, if any, of either Mocho or Mount Diablo on April 18, 19o6, must have been extremely small. During verbal discussions of the earthquake of April 18, 1906, it has been suggested more than once that one of its possible effects may have been to change the position of the earth with relation to its axis of rotation, and so produce a change of latitudes. If an appreciable effect of this kind were possible, the validity of the above reasoning in regard to the latitude observations at Ukiah would be questionable. Accordingly, a computation of this possible effect has been made.* It was found that if it be assumed that the mass displaced in a northerly direction to the westward of the fault comprised 40 ooo square kilometers (15 6oo square miles) of the earth's crust, having a mean latitude of 38° and thickness or depth of 1 IO kilometers (68 miles), that this material had an average density of 4.0, and that the northerly component of the displacement was 3 meters (IO feet), the position of the pole of maximum moment of inertia would be displaced by o".0007, corresponding to 0.002 meter (0.006 foot). This is a limiting value certainly much larger than the actual value, for all assumptions entering the computation as to the area, depth, density, amount of displacement, and mean latitude have been made such as to make the computed value certainly too great. Moreover, the similar displacements of contrary direction to the eastward of the fault would partially cancel those on the westward side which have been considered. When the pole of maximum moment of inertia is displaced, the pole of rotation is n~t immediately changed with reference to the earth. The pole of rotation tends aJways to seek the pole of maximum moment of inertia and travels around it in an irregular path. It is the instantaneous position of the pole of rotation with reference to the earth which fixes the latitude at any instant. Hence, even this extremely small displacement of the pole of maximum moment of inertia computed above, 0.002 meter, does not immediately affect the latitude of points in California, but only tends to change them by that average amount in the course of a year or more. The effect of the earthquake on the latitudes of points outside the region of actual displacement of the surface is therefore entirely negligible. The earthquake changed the latitude of marked points on the earth's surface within the disturbed rngion by the amount of the northward or southward components of the displacement of the points. Similarly, the possible effect of the displacements on the deflections of the verticalthat is, upon the direction of gravity at any point-is too small to be considered. The displacements near Point Arena were computed upon the assumption that the triangulation stations Fisher and Cold Spring remained unmoved during the earth*The formula and method of computation is shown in "Traite de Mecanique Celeste" par F. Tisserand, Paris, 1891 1 Gauthier-Villars, Tome II, pp. 485-487. I 2770-07--7

quake of 1906. Is this assumption true? The station farthest to the eastward from the fault at which a displacement in 1906 has been detected with certainty is Mount Tamalpais, distant 6.4 kilometers and displaced 0.53 meters. Also the rate of decrease of displacements at this distance has been found to be o. 13 meter per kilometer of increase of distance from the fault. At this rate the displacement would become zero at about 11 kilometers from the fault. Fisher is 11.2 and Cold Spring 13.5 kilometers from the fault, hence it is reasonably certain that if the displacement was not zero at these two stations, it was so nearly zero that it could not have been detected with certainty. A high degree of accuracy has been claimed for the triangulation. There is abundant evidence available from which to determine the actual accuracy, as has been indicated in an earlier part of this report. A large amount of time has been spent in studying this evidence in order to insure that the estimates of thi;: accuracy of the determination of the various apparent displacements might be reliable. The methods necessarily followed in estimating the accuracy are so technical and so complicated that it is not desirable to include them in this paper. Two illustrations of the degree of accuracy attained in the observations may prove interesting, however. The position of the Lick Obsei-Vatory small dome was determined after the earthquake of 1906 by intersections upon it from four stations-Loma Prieta, Sierra Morena, Red Hill, and Mocho. There were discrepancies among these observations which were adjusted by the method of least squares and a resulting most probable position adopted and used in computing the apparent displacement given in Table 1. The mean observation from Loma Prieta hit 0.38 meter (1.2 feet) to the left of the position adopted for the dome. The mean observation from Sierra Morena hit 0.22 meter (0.7 foot) to the right, that from Red Hill 0.01 meter (0.03 foot) to. the left, and that from Mocho o. 11 meter (0.4 foot) to the left of the adopted position. The words "right" and "left" refer in each case to the Lick Observatory dome as seen from the station named. The distance of the four observation points from the Lick Observatory were: Loma Prieta 31 kilometers {19 miles), Sierra Morena 59 kilometers (37 miles), Red Hill 46 kilometers (29 miles), and Mocho 17 kilometers (11 miles). Similarly the determination of the position of the Lick Observatory before the earthquake depended upon observations taken from seven stations-Santa Ana, Mount Toro, Loma Prieta, Sierra Morena, Mount Tamalpais, Mount Diablo, and Mocho. The line from Mount Tamalpais, rn6 kilometers (66 miles) long, missed the adopted position by 0.36 meter ( 1.2 feet). The other six all came nearer th~n this to the adopted position. · The Farallon Light-house was determined between 1868 and 1906 by intersections upon it from three stations-Mount Helena, Mount Tamalpais, and Sierra Morena. The mean observation from Mount Helena, distant 112 kilometers (70 miles), missed the adopted position by 0.30 meter (1 .o foot), and the other two lines came closer. In 1906-7 the Farallon Light-hous.e was determined by intersections upon it from the six stations, Ross Mountain, Tqmales Bay, Point Reyes Hill, Sonoma, Mount Tamalpais, and Sierra Morena. The line from Sonoma, 79 kilometers (49 miles) long, missed the adopted position by o.IO meter (0.3 foot), and all the others came closer. One other assumption remains to be examined. The displacements of .1 868 were computed on the assumption that the line Mount Tamalpais to Mount Diablo had a certain length and azimuth before 1868 and certain different length and azimuth after 1868, Mount Tamalpais being supposed to be in a new position, but Mount Diablo

unmoved. The two positions for Mount Tamalpais were derived from cerfain computations, based in turn on assumptions that certain other stations remained unmoved in 1868, or practically so. The azimuth of the line Mount Tamalpais to Mount Diablo was determined by ·observations upon stars in 1859, and again in 1882. The later observations made the azimuth 7".84 greater than earlier observations. The two adopted azimuths from the computations of triangulation referred to above also differ by 5".38, the later adopted value being the greater. The fact that the two independent determinations of change of azimuth, one astronomic and one geodetic, agree within 2".46 is a strong proof that the adopted geodetic azimuths are correct, 2".46 being within the possible range of the various observations. Following the same reasoning as for Mocho and Mount Diablo, the computed displacements of 1868, as shown by red arrows on maps 1 and 2, indicate that the two azimuths and two lengths used for the line Mount Tamalpais to Mount Diablo before and after 1868 must be very close to the truth. ·
CHANGES IN ELEVATION.

The preceding portions of this Report have dealt with permanent horizontal displacements caused by the eart4quake of 1906. It is important to know whether permanent displacements in the vertical direction also occurred. Upon this point the observations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey furnish evidence for a small area, involving parts of San Francisco, both sides of the Golden Gate, and Sausalito, 1! miles north of the Golden Gate. At the time of the earthquake an automatic tide gauge was in operation at the Presidio Wharf, in San Francisco, on the southern side and about 1 ! miles to the east of the narrowest part of the channel through the Golden Gate. The gauge had been in operation at that point continuously since July 17, 1897, and is still in operation. The. record made by this gauge on April 18, 1906, showed an oscillation with a range of about six inches in the water surface, evide.otly produced by the earthquake, but it showed no evidence of a change in the relation of the gauge zero to mean sea level. In other words, the record for that day does not indicate that the tide staff had been changed in elevation· by the earthquake. To detect any possible small change in elevation it is, of course, necessary to examine much more record than that for a single day. The examination has now been extended by computation to include a whole year of observations since the earthquake for comparison with nine years of observation before it. The following table shows the reading of mean sea level on the fixed tide staff for each of ten years, as determined by taking the mean of the hourly ordinates of the tidal curve. The annual means are taken, rather than means for any other period, in order to eliminate annual inequalities, presumably due to meteorological causes, which affect the means for separate months. May 1 is taken as the beginning of the complete year available after the earthquake. Since it is not convenient in the computation to separate any month's observation into two parts, the year is commenced on May 1, rather than on April 18, the date of the earthquake. The first year, 1897-98, is incomplete, because the observations were not commenced until July 17, 1897.

The ten annual means show an unmistakable tendency to fall into three groups, as indicated by the means shown for each group. Within each group there is no apparent tendency to increase or decrease. Between the first and second groups the reading of mean sea level increased 0.202 foot and between the second and third groups it again increased 0.132 foot. Such an increase corresponds to a subsidence of the zero of the tide staff with reference to mean sea level. An examination of the monthly means indicates that probably the subsidence occurred suddenly in each case, the movements taking place about June, 1899, and April, 1904. The record must not be considered as proving positively that these two subsidences took place. The changes are not clearly beyond the ra'.nge of possible error in the determination of mean sea level on account of irregular changes in the water surface due to causes not clearly understood, though they are beyond the possible range of instrumental errors. The annual me11n for the one year after the earthquake, 1906-7, agrees with the two preceding annual means within less than 0.04 foot. In no ~ther case in the table do three successive annual means agree so closely with each other as these three. Apparrently, therefore, no change in the elevation of the zero of the tide staff occurred at the time of the earthquake. As further evidence that no appreciable change in the elevation of the tide staff took place on April 18, 1906, the following table is submitted. Corresponding months of two years, one before and one after the earthquake, are compared to avoid the effects of annual inequalities. The comparison indicates that no change took place in April,
19o6.

The zero of the tide staff was connected by leveling with the group of bench marks near the gauge at various times during the interval 1898-IC)o7, including a determination after the earthquake. The leveling showed no appreciable change in the relation in elevation of the bench marks and the tide staff. Hence, the preceding statements in regard to a ,possible subsidence of the tide staff on two occasions and in regard to its constancy of elevation on April 18, 1906, also apply to this group of bench marks. Before the earthquake the Coast and Geodetic Survey had done leveling whjch connected the gauge at the Presidio Wharf with various bench marks in San Francisco from Fort Point to the Union Iron Works, and with bench marks at Sausalito. This leveling was not of the grade of accuracy known as precise leveling, nor was it done continuously. There are also available for use in the present investigation certain relative elevations of bench marks before the earthquake, furnished to the Coast and Geodetic S~~·~y by the City Engineer of San Francisco. These include a bench mark near the g~~~e at the Presidio Wharf. After the earthquake a line of precise- levels was run from the Presidio gauge to Fort Point'afid Sausalito, and to the eastward through San Francisco to the Union Iron Works, corittecting with various old bench marks. There were 26 bench marks connected by the leveling before the earthquake which were recovered with certainty and the elevations redetermined. The following table shows the elevations of these bench marks before and after the earthquake and their apparent changes in elevations. All of the elevations in the table are referred to the same datum, which is the reading 8.514 feet (2.5951 meters) on the fixed tide staff at the Presidio Wharf, that being approximately mean sea level. All the elevations are computed on the supposition that the zero of the tide staff at the Presidio Wharf remained unchanged at the time of the earthquake.

The table shows no appreciable change of elevation of the bench marks at the Presidio Wharf. The maximum apparent change in elevation is 7.0 millimeters {0.3 inch). a quantity which is within the possible range of error of the leveling. Mr. G. K. Gilbert, Geologist of the U.S. Geological Survey, at the close of an examination made soon after the earthquake and before the leveling had been done, expressed the opinion that if this group of bench marks had not changed their relative elevations they probably had not changed in absolute elevation. It is probable, therefore, that these two bench marks and the tide staff maintained their absolute elevations unchanged. At Fort Point the three bench marks near the shore show an apparent rise of 74 millimeters (2.9 inches) on an average, and bench mark 9, high up on Fort Point, shows

APPENDIX 3.

103

a slightly smaller apparent rise, 59 millimeters (2.3 inches). All these are on ground supposed to be stable. The rise indicated by the city leveling, in the Jast column, is considerably smaller. The two bench marks at Sausalito show an apparent rise of 37 millimeters (LS inches). It is not certain that this represents a real change in elevation as referred to the zero of the Presidio tide staff. The errors of the old and new leveling, including the crossing of the Golden Gate (about 1 t miles) in each case, may account for the apparent change. In the leveling before the earthquake the elevation was transferred from Presidio to Sausalito by water levels and also by wye leveling and vertical angles, with a difference of 13 millimeters (0.5 inch). In the precise leveling after the earthquake the two independent crossings of the Golden Gate, ea:ch depending on many hours of observation, differed by 30 millimeters (I.2 inches). The three bench marks at and near Fort Point showed small apparent changes in elevation. From an examination made soon after the earthquake Mr. G. K. Gilbert, Geologist, expressed the opinion that the bench marks at Lafayette Park were probably more stable than any of the others examined by him. The table indicates that the two of these bench marks formerly determined by Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling subsided 75 milimeters (3.0 inches) and that the one determined by the city leveling rose 43 millimeters (I.7 inches). There is no apparent reason for the contradiction among the three bench marks of this group. For the three bencl~ marks a~ the Union Iron Works the table shows a contradiction, two of them having, apparently, increased in elevation and one having decreased. The greatest change is, however, only 52 millimeters (2.0 inches). The Union Iron Works is said to be partly on filled ground. The two bench marks near the Magdalen Asylum apparently increased in elevation, as shown by both the Coast and Geodetic Survey and city leveling. Of these bench marks, the thirteen in the five groups at Fort Point, Sausalito, Fort Mason, Union Iron Works, and Magdalen Asylum showed an average apparent rise at the time of the earthquake of 35 millimeters (r.4 inches) as determined by Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling. As the leveling simply gives relative elevations the question arises: Does this quantity represent an average rise of the thirteen bench marks, or does it represent a settlement of the zero of the tide gauge and the adjacent bench marks at the Presidio Wharf? The tidal observations are not competent to determine this question with certainty. The general experience with determinations of mean sea level, from long series of tidal observations, warrants the statement that the error in determination from a single year is as apt to be greater as less than t inch ( 19 millimeters), and that it may sometimes be as great as 2; inches (64 millimeters). It is possible, theretore, that the two bench marks at the Presidio Wharf and the zero of the tide gauge have settled 35 millimeters or that it is, in part, a subsidence at the Presidio and in part a rise at the other places. · The elevations of the group of four bench marks in the table commencing with 40B at the Appraisers Building, were determined before the earthquake by the city engineer but not by Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling. These four, in various parts of tpe city, show no apparent change in elevation greater than 69 millimeters (2.7 inches). Two of them apparently rose and two subsided.

GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

The apparent changes in elevation of the three bench marks in the table commencing with 41, at California and Montgomery streets, are not supposed to have much significance in connection with the question of whether a general change of elevation took place. These three bench marks were each subject to local disturbances during the earthquake or were near or on filled ground. In ro cases the old leveling determined elevations of hydrants and the new leveling determined elevations on hydrants in the same locations but known from the descriptions to be different from the old hydrants. Similarly, in seven other cases, the old leveling established the elevations of points on curbstones, steps, or doors, and in each of these cases in the new leveling it was found to be impossible to recover the old point accurately. In all of these 17 'cases there is, therefore, only an approximate connection between the old and the new leveling. The evidence from these bench marks has all been examined carefully and does not lead to any different conclusion from that which may be drawn from the table above. The general conclusion from both the leveling and the tidal elevations is that, within the region examined, there occurred no general change of elevation of sufficient magnitude to be detected with certainty. It is an opportune time at present, on account of local changes in elevation at various bench marks, to :;i.dopt the best possible determination of mean sea level which is available up to date and to refer all new elevations determined since the-earthquake to that datum. Accordingly, the reading 8.652 feet (2.6371 meters) on the tide staff at the Presidio, given in the last column on page 100, which is the mean for the three complete years, May 1, 1904, to April 30, 1907, is adopted as being mean sea level. The values given in column 4 of the table on page ro2 are referred to the reading 8.514 feet (2.5951 meters) as mean sea level. Hence, a correction of - o. 138 foot ( - .0420 meter) should be applied to these values to obtain the elevations now adopted as best. It is uncertain, as already indicated in this report, whether this correction of - .0420 meter is due to improvement in the determination of the relation of mean sea level to the tide staff or to a subsidence of the tide staff and adjacent bench marks in 1904 or earlier, or to both. ·

SIX PRIMARY BASES MEASURED WITH STEEL AND INV AR TAPES.
By Ow1w B.
FRENCH,

Assistant.

GENERAL STATEMENT.

In February, 1906, the writer received instructions to measure six primary base lines, using both steel and invar (nickel-steel) tapes. The invar tapes had never been used for this purpose before, hence the instructions stated that certain of their properties should be in~stigated, and their lengths and coefficients of expansion determined before beginning the base measures. An extract from these· instructions is inserted here to give a clearer understanding of this report.
As soon as the necessary preparations can be made and the expected weather conditions warrant the beginning of such work, you will proceed to measure the following six primary bases: Point Isabel Base, Texas; Willamette Base, Oregon; Tacoma Base, Washington; Brown Valley Base, South Dakota; Stephen Base, Minnesota, and Royalton Base, Minnesota, and to do cer.tain triangulation in the vicinity of the Point Isabel Base as indicated later in these instructions. Aside from the usual preparations for field wotk you will arrange for such cooperation and will cooperate with the Bureau of Standards in the following operations: (a) The regraduation * and redetermination of the length of the iced bar; (b) The graduation and determination of the coefficients of expansion of the three 50-meter steel tapes to be used by you, which have not heretofore been ~sed; (c) The graduation and the determination of the lengths and coefficients of expansion of at least four nickel-steel. tapes; (d) Such investigations of the properties and behavior of the nickel-steel tapes now in the possession of the Coast and Geodetic Survey as you find time to make. Among the questions which it is especially desired to investigate are: What is the yield point or elastic limit of these particular nickelsteel tapes, and is there any danger, if these tapes are used under a 15-kilogram tension in the field, of an appreciable permanent set being produced; are these tapes subject to an appreciable gradual change of length; does exposure to a large range of temperature cause a semipermanent change of length; do the tapes preserve their lengths when subjected to reeling and unreeling? In making these investigations, and in studying the behavior of the nickel-steel tapes in the field, you should keep"in mind that your problem is to investigate the behavior of these particular nickel-steel .tapes for the especial purpose of ascertaining the degree of accuracy that may be conveniently secured with them, used in daylight in the field, of ascertaining the best methods of using them in the daylight, and of ascertaining what special precautions must be taken with them to guard against changes in lengths under field conditions. It is not proposed to make a general investigation of nickel-steel tapes under all conditions, hence the tapes should not be subjected to greater tensions, more severe shocks, or more extreme temperatures than are necessary in order to ascertain the particular facts desired. The field work should be so conducted as to secure: (a) A complete measurement of each base with steel tapes, said measurements to be of a primary standard of accuracy and to be so made that the computations of them can be made independently of any measurements made with nickel-steel tapes; "'No regradnation was found to be practicable within the limited time available. 107

108

COAST ANI;? GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

(b) A complete measurement of each base with nickel-st_eel tapes, said measurement to be of a primary standard of accuracy, if it is found to be possible to· make it so without an excessive amount of remeasurement, but otherwise to be of as high a standard of accuracy as can easily be attained. These measurements of the bases with the nickel-steel tapes are to be so made that the results may be computed independently of any field standardization: (c) To secure by the base measurements themselves as complete an intercomparison of the various tapes as is possible on each base, without any additional measurements made specifically for this purpose only. The following paragraphs indicate the general plan to be followed to accomplish these purposes. Very little increase in the average accuracy of the lengths of the triangle sides in the triangulation connected with these bases will result from increasing the accuracy of the base measurement beyond that represented by a probable error of one part in 500 ooo in the length of each base. The following limits of accuracy are selected with a view of attaining a probable error but little if any greater than one part. in 500 ooo on each base. You will strive to keep as far within these limits as is possible by the use of good judgment and skill, but you will restrict the time and money expended upon each operation substantially to that required to keep barely within these limits. You will standardize four steel tapes at the first base measured and at the last base measured, by measuring the length of a 50-meter comparator at least four times with each tape. The measurements by each tape must not be all made on a single night. If four measures do not §uffice to reduce the probable error of the mean derived length for any tape below 1 part in 300 ooo, additional measurements must be made until the probable error is reduced below that limit. The conditions under which each form of apparatus is standardized sl10uld be as nearly like those under which it is used in the actual measurements of the bases as it is possible to make them. The length of the comparator is to be determined by measuring it with the iced bar at such times that the longest interval between any such measurement and any measurement of the comparator with a tape shall not exceed thirty-six hours. The measurements of the 50-meter comparator with the iced bar should be made in pairs, the directions of progress of the bar being opposite in the two measurements of each pair and said two measurement:; being made in quick succession. A sufficient nt'lmber of measurements of the 50-meter comparator should be made with the iced bar to insure that the probable error of the derived 50-_meter length does not exceed ±o.03mm. Each base shall be measured in sections approximately one km. in length, except that one shorter section may be used on each base. Each base shall be measured with three steel tapes at night, using mercurial thermometers attached to the tapes. The fourth steel tape standardized is to be retained for use in case of serious damage to any one of the three remaining tapes. Each section of each base shall be measured with at least two different steel tapes. Different pairs of steel tapes shall be used on different sections of each base, so that the three tapes used on that base shall thereby be thoroughly intercompared on each base. Two, and only two, measurements of each section shall be made with steel tapes unless the discrepancy between these two measurements exceeds. 2ommvK (K being the length of the section in kilometers), in which case additional measurements are to be made until two measurements arc obtained which agree within the limit stated. At least four nickel-steel tapes should be standardized at the Bureau of Standards before the beginning of the field worl,c Each base should be measured with three of these nickel-steel tapes used in daylight. Each section of each base shall be measured with at least two different nickel-steel tapes. Different pairs of nickel-steel tapes shall be used on different sections of each base, so that the three tapes used on this base shall thereby be thoroughly intercompared. Two, and only two, measurements of each section shall be made with nickel-steel tapes unless the discrepancy between these two measurements exceeds 2ommvK (in which K is the length of the section in kilometers), in which case additional measurements must be made until two are obtained which agree within this limit, provided, however, that no section of any base shall be measured more than four times with nickel-steel tapes. The fourth nickel-steel tape standardized, and any additional ones, are to be retained for use in case of serious damage to any of the three tapes with which all nickel-steel measu,rements would otherwise be made. After the close of the season all the nickel-steel tapes shall again be standardized at the Bureau of Standards. The lengths of the nickel-steel tapes used in the computation shall be made to depend entirely on the standardization at the Bureau of Standards.

Such precautions should be taken to secure accurate horizontal and vertical alignment of the tapes, both steel and nickel-steel, as is necessary to insure that the errors arising from these sources on any section of the base shall be less than 1 part in 1 ooo ooo. It is not desirable, however, to use any more time on this part of the operation than that necessary to keep \\'ell within the limit stated. This principle should also be applied to the determfoation of the tension on the tape while in use.
PARTY ORGANIZATION.

On the Point Isabel and Willamette bases the party consisted of seven persons in all; on the Tacoma Base of six, and on the other three bases of thirteen, for reasons stated later. The measuring party consisted of two observers, one recorder, two tape stretchers, and one or two men to support the tape when it was being carried forward. The two observers were the same on the first three bases. The whole party on the Tacoma Base was the same as the Willamette Base. Another party measured the last three bases. Only a single party was employed on each ot the first three bases, the preparation of the lines being executed by the men employed for the measurement. The preparation of the last three bases was all done by a separate party in charge of the signalman, so that the observing party merely made the measures and ran the levels. This arrangement was due to the fact that the Assistant engaged upon· triangulation in this region was instruc:ted to discontinue that work long enough to assist, with his whole party, in the measurement of these three bases. From four to six men were sent with the preparation party, and a total of seven kept for the measuring party.

A new party was organizeJ and equipped at Willamette Base. The table indicates that five days were spent in traveling from Willamette Base to Tacoma Base. The object of using several different parties during a season was' to save traveling expenses. If both observers and the two tape stretchers should continue on the work from the beginning to the end there would be a slight gain in accuracy.
APPARATUS.

Fifty-meter steel tapes 403, 405, and 406, and 50-meter invar tapes, 438, 439, and 440, were used on all the measures during the season, their coefficients of expansion having been d~termined at the Bureau of Standards in the February standardization.

IIO

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

Steel tape 248 and invar tape 437 were standardized whenever the other tapes were, but not otherwise used. Invar tape 442 was standardized at the Bureau of Standards, but not taken into the field. The graduation marks of the tapes were on small silver sleeves riveted rigidly to the tapes. The distance between the marks on each tape was very nearly 50 meters. The average dimensions and mass per unit of length of these tapes, as furnished by the Bureau of Standards, are as follows: For steel tapes, width, 6.14 millimeters; thicl:ness, 0.43 millimeter, a.nd mass, 19.5 grams per meter of length. For invar tape~. width, 6.31 millimeters (ranging from 6.23 to 6.39 miliimeters); thickness, 0.51 millimete (ranging from 0.50 to 0.52 millimeter), and mass, 25.09 grams per meter (ranging from 24.2 to 25.59 grams). Two thermometers (J. S. Green's, with half-degree graduations) were placed on the> top of each tape when in use, the metal backs of the thermometers being clamped to the tape by small springs, thus permitting the thermometers to be slipped on and off the tape very quickly. All the thermometers used were standardized at the Bureau of Standards before beginning the work. The zero pqints were examined after the completion of the work and no appreciable change was found. The corrections furnished by the Bureau of Standards were applied to all thermometer readings. The tape stretcher used on this work is described on pages 414 and 415, Appendix 8 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1892. * The heavy platform for the operator to stand upon was removed and a steel point about 4 inches long was bolted to the end of the vertical rod in its place. This change not only lightened the load for the operator-a very material con~ideration-but expedited the adjustment of the tape over the marking tables, as it was rar~Iy necessary to use the adjusting screw to bring the tape to the right height, this being accomplished by pushing the point into the ground or pulling .it out a little. The spring balance used to indicate the tension on the tapes was attached to the stretcher in the frame with counterpoise, so that it could be used in a horizontal position. The type of balance was the same as that used in the work of 1900. It has a djal with an index hand moving over it, a complete revolution corresponding to 5 kilograms. The smallest division on the dial is 25 grams, but 10 grams may be easily estimated. Fivekilogram marks are placed on the bar that connects the hook with the spring. A stop is placed at about. 15.3 kilograms, so that too great a tension to the spring can not be applied. _ Several balances were used on the measures. Nos. 134 and 135 were used on the February standardization and then kept for standards in the field, the working balance being tested frequently by puiling against them. The following comparisons show how well these standard balances held during the work. The readings given were those shown by the balance when a 15-kilogram weight was hung on the hook of the balance by a sm~ll c.ord, which passed over a pulley with practically no friction, the balance being

If the first value, taken at a low temperature, be excepted, all of these values, taken before and after the field work, agree well. It is therefore probable that the standard tension during the season was sufficiently accurate, since a change of 25 grams produces an apparent change in length of the tapes not greater than 0.04 millimeter.
INV AR TAPES.

In December, 1905, the Coast and Geodetic Survey purchased from J. H. Agar Baugh, of London, England, several tapes about 53 meters in length, of the alloy of nickel and steel which possesses the property of having a very low coefficient of expansion. Although this alloy has been known for a number of years, it has only recently been produced .in the form of tapes. The experiments with the metal by its discoverer, C. E. Guillaume, of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, near Paris, have been made with wires or bars, as a rule. This alloy has been given the name "Invar," a word derived from the same root as "invariable," and with a similar meaning. The invar tapes are more nearly like nickel than steel in appearance. They are rather soft, bending easily, and are not nearly as elastic as steel. When laid on a flat surface without tension these tapes appear crooked, being full of small bends in all directions. Although a 15-kilogram tension does not entirely remove these bends they are not at all prominent under this tension, and are probably so nearly eliminated that continued stretching does not affect the length of the tape very materially. The slight increase in length that was developed during the season may be a straightening out of some of these bends. Oxidation or rust forms much more slowly on the invar tapes than on the steel. Nevertheless, oiling and reasonable care are necessary. As Guillaume's investigations were with invar wires rather than with tapes, it was considered desirable to make a few test's of the strength and elasticity of these particular tapes before going into the field with them. These were all carried out very carefully under the direction of Albert S. Merrill, of the Bureau of Standards. The following report of the Director of the Bureau of Standards shows the methods employed and the results obtained:
The specimens were submitted in order to determine three things: First, the yield point of the material; secorid, the tensile strength of the material, third, whether permanent set was produced by light loads. The tests made show: First, the yield point is about 70 per cent of the tensile strength; second, the tensile strength is between 450 and 500 pounds actual, or JOO 000 pounds per square inch; third, loads up to 6o pounds (at least) do not cause permanent set.

The tapes submitted were each about 18 inches long and were respectively numbered by one, two, and three punch marks on one end. The average dimensions were as follows:

The yield point was determined by thf: use of a Henning mirror extensometer, the load increments being 20 pounds or less. The ex~ensometer indicated the stretch in the two edge fibers separately. The magnification of the distortion at the reading telescope was one thousand times, enabling readings to be made directly to hundred-thousandths of an inch, and occasionally by estimation, somewhat finer. On passing the yield point, the increasing distortion of the specimen under constant load was revealed by a creeping of the scale reading observed in the telescope, as well as by a sudden increase in the difference between readings. The elongation was measured over a gauge length of 8 inches A' summary of the tests follows: Tape No. r.

Tape l\'o. 1 was subjected to a load of 40 pounds in a closed room for sixty hours. The final reading of the extensometer was identical with that at the beginning, showing .that light loads do not produce a cumulative distortion with long time intervals. Tape No. 3 was tested to determine whether permanent set was produced by light loads. The load in this case was applied by pouring shot into the bucket on the end of the long arm of a lever having a ratio of 10 to 1, the tape with its extensometer being attached .to the short arm of the lever. The bucket used had a· conical bottom, with an outlet through which the discharge of shot was regulated by a rubber tube and pinch cock. The apparatus being rigidly fixed in position and the tape and

extensometer counterbalanced, an initial load of IO pounds was given the specimen by hanging a I-pound weight on the long lever. An additional load of 50 pounds was placed on the specimen by the use of shot. This load was withdrawn and applied three successive times, in each case identical readings being obtained for corresponding loads, proving that small loads do not produce permanent set. An attempt previously made to apply increments of 5 pounds to 65 pounds with decrements of the same amount was not so successful, the final zero being somewhat lower than the initial, which would have indicated contraction. In comparison with the strength of the invar tapes may be placed a specimen of the steel hitherto used in tapes by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The specimen tested had a cross section 0.248 by o.oI8 inch, an area =0.00446 square inch. The maximum load before rupture was 880 pounds, corresponding to I97 ooo pounds per square inch.

Although the tensile strength of the invar tapes was shown to be only about half that of the steel tapes, it is certainly far greater than is necessary for merely the measurement of base lines. The results from these experiments are very satisfactory, no properties being developed that are at all derogatory to the use of these tapes for base me~suring purposes. The graduation marks on the invar tapes were ruled on silver sleeves which were riveted to the tapes near the. ends, in the same manner as for the steel tapes. The distance between the two marks on each of the invar and steel tapes, at a temperature of l 5° (this being the probable average tern perature of the field work), was made very nearly the same, the object being to cause as few set-ups and set-backs as possible during the measurement of the base lines. The reels for the invar tapes were made of aluminum, with a diameter of 16 inches, 1t being stated by Mr. Baugh that it is safe to give the metal this curvature without fear of a permanent change of length. During standardization, one of the· tapes (No. 438) was subjected to a hundred reelings and unreelings several different times without showing any change in length (see p. l 17). A change of 0.05 millimeters, or l/1 ooo ooo, would undoubtedly have been apparent. This proves that the reels used are large enough to insure that there will be no change in length of the tape on account of the size of the reel. Another tape (No. 437), during the standardization, was kept outdoors when not in use, thus being subjected to temperatures from about - 10° to + 30° C., without showing any appreciable change in length.
COMPARATOR AT THE: BUREAU OF STANDARDS.

Five of the invar tapes were standardized at the Bureau of Standards under the direction of Mr. L.A. Fischer, Chief of the I)ivision of Weights and Measures, the writer cooperating with him. The observations were made on the 50-meter comparator, located in the tunnel joining the two principal buildings of th~ Bureau of Standards. The comparator room is about 52 meters long and about 2t meters in width and in height. Along one wall are a number of pipes through which brine at a temperature of - 10° may be pumped to get low temperatures, and along the other wall is a bench or mural standard. The ends of the 50-meter comparator are marked by spherical-headed bolts cemented into concrete piers at either end of the tunnel, the tops of the piers being flush with the concrete floor of the tunnel. The length of this comparator was measured with the 5-meter iced bar, B17 , each day that comparisons were obtained, usually just before and just after the measurements of the tapes. This was found nec12770--07--8

II4

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

essary, as the . distance between the comparator bolts was found to vary through a total range of 0.93. millimeter or 1/54 ooo during the whole period of measurement, dependent mostly on temperature conditions. The greatest range in ans one day between forenoon and afternoon measurements with the iced bar was only 0.052 millimeter. Each determination of the length of the comparator consists of two measures with the iced bar, one going north and one going south. The probable error of a determination was usually less than 0.015 millimeter. The iced bar was used in the usual manner.* The microscopes for holding the measure were mounted on iron brackets or arms which were attached in an adjustable manner to the tops of stone piers about 30 inches above the floor. These stone piers were set on concrete piers about 18 inches deep and 16 inches square. The concrete floor was laid directly on the ground, but was separated from the piers by a space of 2 inches. One of the main walls of the building is not more than a foot from the piers, near the south end. The pier at the north end was built. through a small room under the tunnel. The base of this pier was about 6 feet square a.nd. its height about 8 feet. Each concrete pier at the ends of the comparator is large enough to carry the microscope pier, and also the marking bolt for that end. The slow changes, with a total range of 0.93 millimeter, referred to above, are undoubtedly due to changes in temperature conditions in the walls, floor, and piers. The microscopes and cut-off cylinders hitherto used with B 17 were also used here. Each stone pier has a hole cut through its top just below the microscope arm, through which the illumination for the microscope is thrown, an ordinary electric bulb being hung back of each pier for this purpose. This method of illumination proved very satisfactory.
DETERMINATION OF LENGTH OF ICED BAR.

The length of B 17 was determined in February, before beginning the field work, and again in October, after its completion. One of the 5-meter spaces of the comparator was built with piers r meter apart especially for this work. A determination of the length of B 17 consisted of three measures of this 5-meter space with the prototype meter No. 21 and two with the 5-meter bar, alternating with each other. Six such determinations were made in February and 2 1 in October, The February determinations gave the length of B 17 = 5 meters - 16.6 microns± l. l microns, differing only 0.4 micron from the old value. The October determinations gave B 17 = 5 meters - 26.3 microns± 1. I microns. A change in length for B 17 of almost 10 microns, nearly 11 inr1Hir of the length, is shown. When this change. occurred, or why, is unknown. The bar was always handled by the writer and was never subjected to any bending other than the small bends which always occur when the bar is ·lifted from its box. The box in which the bar is transported has a notch for the support of the bar about every foot. This box is packed in a larger one whenever shipped. The bar and its packing boxes were examined very carefully to note possible rough handling, but no evidence of such was found. The temperature to which the bar was subjected during this interval was very high at times.

The purity of the ice used in standardizing the 5-meter bar was determined by very sensitive electric conductivity tests and also by readings of standard thermometers placed in it. There is no question that the first value should be used for the February determinations and the last for the October determinations, but in the case of the field standardization of the steel tapes the only criterion is the agreement of the various values. If one length for the bar be used in both field standardizations, the lengths obtained for the steel tapes are from 0.06 millimeter to 0.19 millimeter (averaging 0.11 millimeter) longer on the second than on the first standardization. By assuming that the change in length of B~ 7 occurred between the two field standardizations these differences are all reduced, the average becoming only 0.01 millimeter, which is unquestionably very strong evidence that the change actually occurred during that period. The computations for the lengths of the steel -tapes were made, therefore, using the first value for the Point Isabel standardization and the second value for the Royalton standardization. The final determinations for the invar tapes are not sufficiently accurate or numerous either to verify or contradict the assumption that the change in the length of B 17 occurred between the two field standardizations. One of the invar tapes has the difference increased by this assumption and two of them have it diminished.
METHODS OF STANDARDIZATION OF' TAPES AT THE nuREAU OF STANDARDS.

In the determinations at the Bureau of Standards the tapes were used in practically the same manner as in the field. They were supported at the graduation marks and at one point in the middle, all three points being in a straight line and at very nearly the same level. Metal-backed thermometers were attached to the top of each tape r meter toward the middle of the tape from the marking sleeves. This enabled the observers to reach them easily and yet have them far enough away not to be affected by the heat of the observer's body, lamps, etc. As the temperatures were not quite the same in different parts of the tunnel, other thermometers were suspended alongside the tapes, with their bulbs at the same height as the tape. Three thermometers were used for the invar tapes and three or five for the steel tapes, uniformly distributed, only two being attached to the tape. One end of the tape was held by an adjustable clamp. At the other end a small hook was clamped to the tape and the balance was attached to it. The other end of the balance was attached .to an adjustable ratchet device. The tapes were suspended under the end microscopes of the comparator, using the cut-off cylinders for the end supports. Each comparison of a tape consisted of two or more simultaneous pointings upon the graduation marks by the two observers, then of two or more.simultaneous pointings after the observers had exchanged places, all thermometers being read after each two paintings. The observer at the balance end looked after the tension and made the reading on the balance, at the instant of making a pointing, agree with that which corresponded to a r 5-kilogram tension. The tape was always tapped lightly just before making a pointing, so as to eliminate the effect of friction.
COEFFICIENTS OF EXPANSION OF TAPES.

In the February standardization, 12 or i 3 determinations were obtained for each of the five invar tapes, 6 determinations at a temperature of about + 4° C. and the

remainder at about + 25° C. Four steel tapes were also compared, 12 to 14 determinations being obtained for each, 5 to 7 of them at a temperature of about +4° C. and the remainder at about + 25° C. The coefficient of expansion was computed for each tape from these determinations. The coefficients of expansion thus obtained, expressed as the change in the length of the tape (50-meter) for 1° C., are shown in the following table.

These probable errors for the tapes do not include the probable error of the length of the comparator. The probable error of the length of the comparator was introduced directly into the final determination of the probable error of each base line as it affected the length of all the tapes equally. More observations were obtained in February than in October owing to lack of knowledge regarding the. behavior of the comparator tunnel (this being the first work of this character done in it), and also because more results were required in order to derive satisfactory coefficients of expansion for the tapes. In computing the adopted lengths of the tapes, the mean of the October values was given a weight equal to that of the mean of the February values. All five tapes show a slight lengthening between the February and October standardizations. The change for each tape is as follows:

This apparent lengthening of the inv~r tapes may be due to an actual molecular change in the metal, or to a partial straightening out of the numerous small bends in the tapes, or possibly to both. As the graduation lines on some of the tapes are somewhat irregular, and not quite perpendicular to the tape, these differences are probably caused in part by pointing upon different portions of these lines in the two standardizations. The adopted lengths and coefficients of expansion for the five invar tapes are given below. The probable errors of the lengths and .of the coefficients of expansion are also given.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.
POINT ISABEL COMPARATOR.

In order to standardize the steel tapes, two 50-meter comparators were prepared for use of the iced-bar apparatus, one at the first base near Point Isabel, Tex., and one at the last base, near Royalton, Minn. The site for the first comparator was about 300 meters north of the middle of the Point Isabel base line. The ground was practically level and the soil a hard loam almost like adobe. A detailed description of the iced bar, its use, records, etc., may be found on pages 338-350 of Appendix 8 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1892, "On the measurement of the Holton Base." The posts for the support of the microscopes wer~ about 9 by 14 centimeters, set firmly in the ground with about 0.7 meter projecting. These posts were set in line with their centers 5 meters apart. The end microscopes were mounted on heavy iron plates, bolted to posts made by framing together four posts similar to those used for the intermediate microscopes. The ends of the comparator were marked by spherical-headed brass bolts set in concrete blocks of peculiar shape, designed to get stability in the line of the comparator and not be easily disturbed by the movements of the observers. The blocks were 20 by 76 centimeters on the base, 20 centimeters square on the top, and 76 centimeters deep, the top being set flush with the surface of the ground and the long dimension parallel with the line of the comparator. Each was set on a thin bed of sand, and then earth tamped around it solidly. The iced-bar trucks were supported on three 5-meter sections of portable track, which were moved alongside the microscope posts as the measurement progressed, and supported on posts driven midway between the microscope posts. In order to avoid systematic errors the end posts and cut-off cylinders were usually shaded from the sun by large umbrellas during the measurement, although part of one post might be in the sun for some time while the work was in progress at the other end. The intermediate posts were not shaded at all during the measurement, except when the observer's body happened to do so. The same microscopes, iced bar, trough, and cut-off cylinders used in 1900 were used on this work, the only changes being the insertion of new level vials in the cut-off cylinders. The microscopes were leveled very closely to a uniform grade and aligned with a theodolite before beginning the first measurement, and also before the last. As there were post caps enough for all of the posts, the microscopes could be placed in position before beginning the measure, and stops were clamped to the arms to hold the positions while the microscopes were being moved along. The iced bar was aligned by stretching a thread just above the· aligning plugs, and leveled with striding level used heretofore. Before each of these operations as much ice was placed in the trough as was possible without interfering ·with these operations. The distance between the terminal spheres of the Point Isabel comparator was measured eight times between March 26 and April 3. The same observers made all the. readings and pointings on the bar ends, exchanging places, so that each ma.de a

These results indicate very slight, if any, change in the length of the comparator during the entire period. As the difference between two measures made in opposite directions is probably due to the effect of the sun's heat on the microscopes and their supports,* it is best eliminated by taking the mean of two measures made in opposite directions with the sun in about the same position; hence, the values in column s give the true length of the comparator as accurately as can be obtained from the measures made. Their mean, which is the same as the mean of the individual measures, gives :So meters + 12.224 millimeters as the length of the comparator, with a probable error of ± 0.009 millimeter, obtained from the residuals in the last column. The probable error of B 17 is ± r. r microns, and for ten bar lengths is ± o.oII millimeter; hence the resulting probable error for the Point Isabel comparator is · ±,,/ (.009) 2

ROYALTON COMPARATOR.

This comparator was similar to the Point Isabel comparator, and was prepared in the same manner, except that granite blocks were used in marking the ends of the comparator, instead of concrete. The comparator was located in the lumber yard of the Royal tori Lumber Company, at Royalton, Minn., just south of the main part of the town, and was about 2 miles from the north end of the Royalton Base. The direction of the comparator was about southsoutheast and northnorthwest. . The same method of procedure was followed here as at Point Isabel, except that the alignment of the microscopes was obtained by stretching a fine wire between the

end microscopes and in their foci, and then setting the intermediate microscopes so that each was exactly over this wire, as shown by the image of the wire appearing in the center of the field of the microscope. The apparatus used was the same as at Point Isabel, except that a new level vial was inserted in cut-off cylinder No. 1 before beginning this work. Only four measures of this comparator were made, two just before the beginning of the tape comparisons and two immediately after. The same observers made all of the pointings and readings, exchanging positions in the same manner as usual for each position of the bar. The following table gives the results of the measures in the same form as for the Point Isabel comparator. The length of the iced bar used was 5 meters - 26.3 microns, as obtained in the October standardization.

The .first two measures were made when the sun's rays were nearly perpendicular to the comparator, and are fairly accordant. The other two were made with the sun nearly in line with the comparator and differ considerably. This is what should be expected if the discrepancies are due to the movements of the microscopes caused by unequal changes of temperature dependent upon the position of the sun. The determination of July 9 differs from that of the IIth by 0.089 millimeters. This is rather a large change to be considered due to errors of observation, but is well within the possible range of movement of stones set a few hours before. Hence the comparator is considered as having changed length between the two measures, the first value being used for the first tape determinations and the second for the last determinations. This assumption gives more accordant values for all the tapes, thus indicating that it is justified.
METHODS OF Fil<;LD STANDARDIZATION.

Eight tapes were compared with the 50-meter comparators at Point Isabel and Royalton. Two double comparisons at each place were obtained for the four steel tapes, made at night, and one double comparison at each place for the invar tapes, made in daylight. The determinations of the steel tapes. were made on two nights at each place, one double determination each night. A measure of the comparator with the iced bar was obtained just before or after the comparisons of the tapes, the constancy of the distance between the terminal marking spheres not being depended upon for more than about twelve hours, except for the Royalton determinations of the invar tapes.

APPENDIX 4. SIX BASES WITH STEEL AND INVAR TAPES.

The tapes were supported and used in the comparisons in practically the same manner as in the base measures. The rear end was held by an adjustable clamp fastened to a fixed beam, so that there was no unsteadiness at this end. The tape stretcher and balances used in the base were used in the comparisons. The balances were frequently compared with the standards, and that reading of the balance always used which corresponded to a tension of 15 kilograms. The middle support of the tapes was a wire, hung accurately in line with the end supports and free to swing slightly across the comparator so that small errors in alignment would be corrected automatically. The cut-off cylinders were used for the end supports. The tapes to be compared were all unreeled and hung on brackets alongside of the comparator before beginning the comparisons, thus permitting them to assume an approximately fixed temperature. A few minutes always elapsed after the tape was brought under the microscopes and the thermometers attached before the first pointings were obtained, hence the thermometers probably indicated the temperature of the tapes very closely, particularly as the changes in temperature were slow and small during the comparisons, and the temperatures indicated by the thermometers at opposite ends of the tapes were practically identical. Care was taken not to bring heat near the tapes 'while they were in use. Electric hand lamps were used to read the thermometers. The illumination for the microscopes was obtained by mounting acetylene signal lamps about 4 meters away from the tapes, at the Royalton comparator, and by small bull's-eye lanterns mounted about 1 meter from the tapes, at the Point Isabel comparator. A common lantern was used to illuminate the balance both on the comparisons and the base measures, but it was always more than a meter from the measuring part of the tape. The comparisons were made in the same manner as at the Bureau of Standards. (Seep. 115.) Extra pointings were frequently made, however, as the wind effect was sometimes uncertain and difficult to eliminate, particularly on the comparisons of the invar tapes. Frequent delays (except on the last night's work at Royalton) of several minutes were neces~ary on all of the comparisons to get pointings on the graduation marks of the tapes when the effect of the wind was small. This effect upon accepted pointings was probably less than 1/500 ooo (or 0.1 millimeter) and this limit was not often exceeded on the base measures. The invar comparisons were affected by wind more than the steel. The invar comparisons were made merely for use in studying the actiop of the invar tapes, and no delay was made to get them.
LENGTHS OF STEEL TAPES.

The following table shows the observed values for the steel tapes. .The quantities in the column headed "Computed" were obtained by reducing the final mean length for the tapes to the temperature of each individual observation. One determination at Royalton of Tape 406 was rejected, as there was apparently an error in reading the micrometers or in recording the readings.

All March and April comparisons were made at Point Isabel and all July comparisons at Royalton. On March 26 the wind was southeast and light; it was slightly cloudy, and there was a light dew. On April 2 the wind was southeast and moderate, and there was no dew. On July 9 the wind was usually light, but occasionally strong; it was cloudy, and there were showers near and light rain during the comparison of tape 405; no dew. On July I I it was fair and calm, with a light dew. An examination of the residuals in the table shows that there was practically no change in the length of any one of these tapes during the season. Tape 406 shows the

largest difference between the first and second standardizations (0.09 millimeter), but this is of the same order as the errors of observation. hence can not be considered as indicating an actual change in the length of the tape. For the determination of the coefficients of expansion see page 115. No other computation for the coefficients of expansion was attempted, as the coefficients obtained at the Bureau of Standards are as accurate as required, and the observations were made under more favorable conditions for this purpose than the observations in the field. The adopted lengths and coefficients of expansion of the tapes are given below. The probable errors of the lengths and of the coefficients of expansion are also given. The temperatures shown are the mean temperatures of standardization of the tapes.

The probable errors for a single determination for the four tapes are, respectively,
·±0.028 millimeter, ±0.068 millimeter, ±0.048 millimeter, and ±0.056 millimeter. Tape 248 was used on the base measures of 1900. The coefficient of expansion for

this tape, given above, was taken from those measures, no new determination having been made. This tape was not used during the measures of 1906, except at the time of the standardization. The length here given is about 0.1 millimeter shorter than that obtained in 1900. * This may be due partially to the fact that different parts of the graduation line were used in the two standardizations. In the 1900 work the middle of the lines was pointed on. As it is difficult to make the two graduation lines accurately perpendicular to the line of the tape, the ends of the lines on one side of the tape were used, both in the standardization and base measurement, thus eliminating this possible source of error. A small cross was cut in the silver sleeve near the side used, in order to identify it. This statement applies to the invar as well as to the steel tapes.
CHECK FIELD DETERMINATIONS OF INVAR TAPES.

The following table shows the results obtained from the field determinations of the lengths of the invar tapes. These determinations were made merely as a check or for use in studying the action of the invar tapes. They were made under adverse conditions, frequent delays for lulls in the wind being necessary in order to obtain results that would agree within 0.2 millimeter. Notwithstanding this fact, the results obtained for three of the tapes agree well with those obtained at the Bureau of Standards and the other does not differ from the Bureau of Standards' determination more than might be expected, judging from the size of the residuals. The instructions issued to the party when this work was undertaken stat~d that the invar tapes should be standardized at the Bureau of Standards, one of the prin·Seep. 265, Appendix 3, of the Coast and Geodetic·Survey Report for 1901, "On the measurement of nine base lines along the ninety-eighth meridian."

cipal objects in using tapes with a small coefficient of expansion being to eliminate the necessity for field standardization. For this reason, together with the fact that the field determinations were not obtained under satisfactory conditions, the field results were not used in determining the adopted lengths for the invar tapes. . The measurements on March 30 were made at Point Isabel. 'fhe weather was fair, the wind was southwest, light and moderate. The measurements on July 10 were made at Royalton. The weather was fair, with a light wind across the line.

FIELD PROCEDURE.

I27

The method of procedure in the field was practically the same as the measurements with tapes in 1900.* · The base line was first cleared of brush, timber, grass, etc., and flag poles set on the line very accurately with a 7-inch or 8-inch theodolite, at distances of about a half mile. Posts 4 inches square were driven every 50 meters along the line, with their tops about half a meter above the ground. It was found advisable to have the heights of all of these posts very nearly the same, so that it would not be necessary to change the height of the tape stretcher while making the measures. Two by four inch stakes were driven midway between the posts, and a nail driven horizontally into each to support the tapes, each nail being in the straight line between the tops of the adjoining posts, except where the character of the ground made it necessary to elevate the middle support in order to keep the tapes above obstructions. The edges of these stakes were set accurately on the base line, and a line marked on top of the posts on the base line, using a theodolite for this purpose. Short sights were taken, and only a forward line run, hence the errors of alignment were practically n,othing. Every twenty tape lengths (1 kilometer), posts, 4 by 6 inches, were set very solidly to hold the measure for a few days if necessary. Whenever a post could not be driven until solid, one or more braces were driven alongside and nailed to it, thus making a very rigid support. Usually all posts at each base were set before the measures were begun. The tapes were supported, with the them1ometers fastened to them, in the same manner .as during the standardization. The forward end was always carried by the observer at that end, and the loop slipped over the hook of the balance as soon as the tape stretcher, with balance attached, was placed on the ground near each post. The rear observer carried his end of the tape when moving forwar<l: A small steel bar was used for the stretcher at the rear end. As soon as the tape was in place, and at the correct height resting lightly on the post, the forward observer called "Ready." The rear end being very nearly in contact by this time, the rear observer then p.erfected the contact and called" Mark." The tension, being held at approximately 15 kilograms thus far, was perfected as soon as the rear observer called "Mark." A mark was then made by the forward observer upon the copper strip, exactly in the prolongation of the graduation mark on the tape. As the rear observer called "Mark" a man near the middle of the tape tapped it lightly from below, so as to eliminate the effect' of friction. The forward observer also lifted the tape on the post to be sure that it was free from friction. He always waited to make the mark until the tape became steady, and until the man at the stretcher called "Tension." As soon as the mark was made the forward observer called "Right." Then each observer read the thermometer at his end, unhooked the tape from the stretchers, and the party proceeded to the next .50-meter space. The recorder noted all temperature readings, set-ups, set-backs, time, weather conditions, and all other necessary data. He also watched the forward tape stretcher to see that the correct tension was applied, and held a light to illuminate the balance

for the night work. The tapes were never allowed to touch the ground or other objects, except by accident occasionally while working through fences or around pools of water. Three steel and three invar tapes were used on the measurement of each base, the same set of tapes being used on all six bases. Each tape was Used on approximately two-thirds of each base, the sections being so arranged as to furnish a complete intercomparison between all the tapes on each base. Two complete and independent measures were made with the steel tapes, and also two with the invar tapes. All of the measures with steel tapes were made at night and all measures with the invar tapes in the daytime. In order to permit comparison of the various measures of a section all the marks at the kilometer posts were referred to an initial or zero line. Copper strips, 55 by 1 1 by 1 .4 millimeters, were nailed to the tops of the posts (usually during the first measure) to hold the marks corresponding to tape lengths. The thickness of the copper strips was the same as that of the silver-marking sleeves on the tapes, so that there was no chance for parallax when the tape was brought alongside the copper strip ready for the measure. Large scratch awls were used for making the marks on four of the base!', but were not satisfactory, as the points broke very easily, and occasionally a broken-pointed awl had to be used for .part of a measure. At Brown Valley a large leather needle was obtained and proved excellent, the point neither breaking nor wearing off. All set-ups and set-backs were obtained from a proportional one-fourth-meter scale by taking the distance from the copper strip with a pair of dividers, except a few which were measured directly with a steel tape having millimeter graduations. The balance used on the base measures was frequently compared with the standard balances, usually twice a day, and further tested by noting its own reading when held suspended by its own hook.· The latter test was applied frequently during the measures, and particularly whenever the balance received a jerk that might cause a shifting of the index hand on the pivot. At the base ends a marking table was set directly over the station mark and a copper strip nailed with its edge exactly over the station mark and in line with the base. A mark was made on the copper strip exactly over the station mark, for the starting point of the tape measures. All fractional tape lengths were measured with the 50-meter tapes and a 3-meter bar. In order to measure a distance of 25 meters a tape was stretched over this space, using first one end and then the other, a small scratch or line near the middle of the tape being used for both measures. The mean of the two marks on the copper strip then defined one-half the length of the tape. Distances less than 25 meters were measured with a 3-meter steel bar with a wooden supporting back. This bar has been used many times and its corrections are well determined .. The programme usually followed was to make a measure of about 3 kilometers with one invar tape and then measure back with another, for a forenoon's work. In the afternoon computations, etc., were made and in the evening a double measureof 3 kilometers with two steel tapes, thus making a quadruple measure of 3 kilometers in a day. A single measurement of more than 12 kilometers per day was not infrequent,

14.45 kilometers being the greatest distance measured in one day. Eight kilometers were measured in a half day several times. To measure more than 6 kilometers in a half day, however, without sacrificing accuracy requires an experienced party. The elevation of the top of each post, and of all intermediate stakes which were above the line joining the tops of the two adjoining posts, was obtained by a double line of levels along each base. The rear observer did all of the leveling (except at the Royalton Base), usually at times when the weather was not propitious.for tape measures, causing very little delay. At Point Isabel a short side line of levels was run to connect with a tide staff, and another line at the Willamette Base to connect with a United States Geological Survey bench mark. Precise level No. 8, with a self-reading rod graduated to centimeters, was used on all of the leveling. The correction to the measured length of a base, due to the tape being inclined slightly instead of being horizontal, was obtained very quickly from specially prepared ·tables.
POINT ISABEL
BAS~

LINE.

Point Isabel Base is situated about 5 miles west of the village of the same name, near the mouth of the Rio Grande River, in Cameron County, Tex. The line is as near the southern end of Laguna Madre as it could well be located, the shore line at one point being only about 100 meters distant. The length of the base is 7.4 kilometers. The latitude of the middle point of the line is 26°, the longitude 97°, and the mean azimuth 113 · 4. The east end of the base was the north end of a short base line located ·n 1886. The original subsurface mark was recovered and the station was re-marked. The underground mark was a cylinder of concrete 8 inches in diameter and 8 inches ~ong. The surface block was a cylinder of concrete 18 inches in diameter and 26 inches long, built around a terra-cotta sewer pipe 6 inches in diameter. The top of the underground block was 22 feet below the surface of the ground and the top of the surface block flush with the ground. The point of a 12-penny galvanized nail, projecting about a quarter of an inch, was used to indicate the·center for both the underground and surface marks. West Base was marked in the same manner, except that a bronze station mark was used for the station mark, a half-inch copper bolt for the underground mark (a cross in each indicating the exact center), and a' 4-inch sewer pipe instead of a 6-inch pipe. Tripods and scaffolds 30 feet in height were erected over these stations for use in the triangulation, which was executed by the base party. Strong winds which prevailed during the measurement of this base caused some delay and also affected the accuracy of the measures slightly. The ground over which this base was measured is very nearly level, no tape length having a slope of more than 1.7 per cent, only a few over 0.5 per cent, and in no case was it necessary to raise the support for the middle of a tape above the line joining the ends .. The line required little cutting of brush and cacti to open it for measure, but the cutting of tough bunch or wire grass about 18 inches high was necessary over a large part of t~ line. The elevation of the base above mean sea level was determined by connecting the leveling along the base with a tide staff, upon which a few readings of· low water were

obtained. As the range in the tide is very small in this region the tidal plane used (obtained by adding one-half the range in tides) probably does not differ from mean sea level more than 0.25 meter. The height of East Base is 4.242 meters, of West Base 3.000 meters, and the average for the whole base 3.604 meters. The,reductien to mean sea level for the whole base is - 4.2 millimeters. The reduction was computed separately for each section, using the formula: C = s !i:_, where C is the
p

reduction to sea level for a section of length s, and mean height h, p being the radius of the earth's curvature for this line. The length of this base was computed from the measurements with the invar tapes and the measurements with the steel tapes, independently, and then these two values combined for a final length. The following table shows the results of the measures of the various sections . . The time of day is given to tenths of hours. All measures with steel tapes were made at night and all measures with invar tapes in the daytime, hence it is unnecessary to insert a. m. or p. m. The columns headed ''Weather,'' ''Wind,'' ''Temperature,'' ''Temperature, rising or falling,'' and "Temperature range" are inserted to permit the study of possible sources of errors. The abbreviations used in these columns are: R = rising; F =falling, for temperature; F =fair; C =cloudy; P =partly cloudy; R =rain; M =mist; and D =dew, for weather conditions; L=Iight; M=moderate; and H=fresh, for wind, with the usual abbreviations for its direction. The temperature range is given to tenths of degrees for the steel tapes, but only to degrees for the invar tapes, owing to their smaller coefficients of expansion. The column headed " Corrected length of section " shows the result of each measurement of a section after all corrections were applied, namely: Correction to reduce to the temperature of standardization, correction for length of tape at the temperature of standardization, correction for set-ups and set-backs, correction for grade, and. correction to reduce to mean sea level. ·

The probable error of each section was obtained from the residuals shown in column 12, computing the probable error for the two kinds of tapes independently. These probable errors were then combined with the probable errors of the lengths of the particular tapes used on that section, to get a probable error for the section. In computing the probable error for the length of the tapes, the probable error for the length of

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1<107.

the comparator was not included. It was combined with the final determination for the probable error of the whole base. The square root of the sum of the squares of the probable errors of the sections is the probable error of the measurement of the base, giving probable error of measurement, steel tapes, ±5.22 millimeters; invar tapes, ± 2 .82 millimeters. These probable errors were then combined with those due to the probable errors of the coefficients of expansion of the two metals, respectively. The probable errors of the coefficients of expansion for the three steel tapes are ± 0.003, ± 0.004, and ± 0.003 millimeter per tape length, per degree C., as previously given. Hence, the average probable error for the mean of any two is ±0.0024 millimeter per tape length or ±0.048 millimeter per kilometer. The mean of two was taken because two steel tapes were used on each section. The average temperature of standardization for the three steel tapes was 20°.74 C. Subtracting this value from the mean temperature of the steel tapes for each section, as given in the table, and multiplying the algebraic sum of these differences by 0.048, there is obtained the probable error of the length of the base, as measured with steel tapes, due to the probable errors of the coefficients of expansion, namely, ± r.70 millimeters. The probable errors of the coefficients of expansion of the three invar tapes are ± 0.0008, ± 0.0006, and ± 0.0006 millimeter per tape length, per degree C., as previously given. Hence the average probable error for the mean of any two is ±0.0005 millimeter, or ±0.010 millimeter per kilometer. Computed in the same manner as for the steel tapes, as indicated in the preceding paragraph, the probable error of the length of the base, as measured with the invar tapes, due to the probable errors of the coefficients of expansion is ±0.23 millimeter. These probable errors, due to the probable errors of the coefficients of expansion combined with the probable errors of measurement already given (±5.22 and ±2.82), give ±5-49 and ±2.83 millimeters for the measu'res with steel and with invar tapes, respectively. These two probable errors indicate that the measure with invar tapes is considerably more accurate than with the steel tapes and that these two measures should be combined, giving the invar a weight of nearly four to one, if only accidental errors are considered. As there are probably small systematic errors affecting both kinds of tapes, a weight of only two to one was used in the combination for the final length of the base. The probable error of the weighted mean· is ± !.J(5.49) 2 + (2)2(2~8J) 2 = ± 2.63 millimeter. The probable error for a determination of the length of the comparator rarely exceeded ± o.o 15 millimeter, and the length of each tape depends upon at least two determinations of the comparator, hence ±0.010 millimeter has been taken as the probable error of the comparator for all this work. The effect of this probable error on the whole base is obtained by multiplying ±0.010 millimeter by 148, the number of lengths of the comparator in the base, giving the probable error of the base, due to this cause, ± r.48 millimeters. This, combined with the probable error of the weighted mean, gives the final probable error of the Point Isabel Base ± 3.02 millimeters, or one part on 2 450 ooo.

BASE I,INH.

The \Villamette Base is situated near the upper end of the valley of the Willamette River, in Lane County, Oreg., about a mile west of the main line of the Southern Pacific Railroad at Irving. The length of the base is 14 kilometers; the latitude of the middle point is 44° 08', the longitude, 123° 12', and the mean azimuth, 172° 21'. The ground over which the base was measured was so nearly level that it was necessary at only one place in the entire line to elevate the middle support for the tapes above the line joining the end supports. -There were only eighteen tape lengths where the slope was greater than 1 per cent and only one where it was over 2 per cent. Each end of the base was marked underground by a cross in a half-inch copper bolt, 6 inches long, set in a block of concrete, 1 foot thick by 3~ feet in diameter at the South Base, and r foot thick by 2 feet in diameter at the North Base, set about 3 feet below the surface of the ground. The surface mark was a cross cut in a bronze station mark, set in a concrete block (the top about flush with the surface of the ground), 3 feet in diameter on the base, r ~ feet in diameter on top, and 2 ~ feet deep. A concrete block, 18 by r 8 inches on the base, 1 2 by 1 2 inches on top, and 2 ~ feet high, was set over each end mark after the completion of th_e measures. When this base line was leveled, a side line of levels about a kilometer in length was run to connect with a bench mark established by the U. S. Geological Survey in

TACOMA BASH LINE.

Tacoma Base. is situated in Pierce County, Wash., south of the city of Tacoma. It is 12 kilometers in length, 8 kilometers being along the driveway of ~acific avenue and 4 kilometers through fields, a few of which are tilled. The line passes through the eastern edge of the village of Spana way, 9 miles south of Tacoma. Each end of this base was marked underground by a cross cut in a half-inch copper bolt, 3 inches long, set in a concrete block 30 inches square and 6 inches thick, plac~d 3 feet below the s111rface of the ground. The surface mark was a cross cut in a regular bronze station mark set in a concrete block, 2~ feet in each dimension. The center was also indicated by a 4-inch drain tile set in the concrete block. The tops of the tile, station mark, and concrete block were all set about flush with the surface of the ground. The latitude of the middle point of the base is 47° 08', the longitude, 122° 30', and the mean azimuth, oQ 44'. On about one-half mile of the base it was necessary to cut much brush and small timber, but the remainder was open. The soil was solid gravel, in which it was. difficult to drive the stakes, but in which they held well. About 7 kilometers of the base line (the straight line between the base ends) at the north end was either in or near Pacific avenue, a somewhat crooked road. As it was impracticable to measure along the center of the road and very difficult to open the line through the brush, logs, etc., bordering the road, the measurement of this part of the base was made in a series of straight lines following the edge of th.e road and yet very near the base line. A point for the beginning of the measurement was located on th~ east side of the driveway of Pacific avenue, on a line from North Base perpendicular to the base line. The line of measurement then followed the cast side of the driveway for about 6 kilometers, where it crossed to the west side. Angles were made in this line- of measurement wherever necessary to keep clear of the brush on one side and the traffic on the other. A point was located accurately on the base line opposite each one of these angle posts, using an 8-inch theodolite, and the olisets measured accurately. The following table gives these olisets and the corrections necessary to reduce the measured sections to the base line. Each quantity iri column "h" is the differenc;e between the olisets at the ends of a section of length "S." The formula used for compu_ting the grade corrections was also used for computing these corrections.

· The errors caused by measurin:; a broken line instead of the base line itself are negligible, as they are of the same character as those due to grade corrections, and are certainly not larger. Owing to the roughness of the ground, a measurement along the straight line would undoubtedly have been less accurate than the measurement along this broken line, which followed a graded road. Further, the additional expense of preparing the base line itself for measurement would have been not less than $100, and. possibly considerably more. The weather, during the progress of the measures on this base, was not .Propitious for rapid and accurate work with tapes. The wind was rather fresh occasionally, and raiti interrupted the work considerably. Rain also made .the grass and brush on the south end of the line so wet that it was impossible to keep the tapes and thermometers dry. The measurement of sections IO to 13 with steel tapes was made with the thermometers moist, thus probably causing indicated temperatures somewhat lower than the actual temperatures of the tapes. The lengths of these four sections, as determined with the invar tapes, are each about 5 millimeters longer than the lengths determined with the steel tapes. This cpuld not. be caused by an accumulation of moisture on the tapes, as it is in the wrong direction, and an additional weight of one-thirtieth of the weight of the tape would be required to produce it. ·If, however, the thermometers indicated temperatures 0°.4 too low the whole difTerence would be accounted for. The ground over which this base was measured was much more irregular than that of any other base measured <luring this season. There were many places where the middle support for the tape had to be raised considerably above the line joining the two end supports. On one half-t'lpe length the slope was nearly 10 per cent, but on all others it was less than 5 per cent. The correction for grade on one kilometer section was almost half a meter, double that of any other kilometer on any of the bases measured. The elevations along this base depend on an elevation of 33.518 meters for the U. S. Geological Survey bench mark on Tacoma City Hall, brought through two figures of the triangulation by trigonometric leveling. The several determinations for the height of North Base agree within 0.22 meter, and the trigonometric difference in

+ is east of the base line.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

height between the base ends agrees within 0.20 meter with the difference obtained from the levels run over the base, thus showing that the trigonometric work is sufficiently accurate. The height of North Base above mean sea level is 124.70 meters; of South Base, 122.57 meters, and the average height of the base is 110.375 meters. The reduction to sea level for the base, computed in the same manner as for Point Isabel Base, is -·209 millimeters. The following table shows the results of the measures of the various sections. The measurements with steel tapes and with invar tapes were combined, and the probable errors computed, in the same manner as for Point Isabel Base.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.
STEPHEN BASE LINE.

This base is situated in Marshall County, l\'linn., a short distance east of the town of Stephen. Each end _of the base was marked at the surface by a 1-millimeter drill hole in a bronze station mark set in a granite block 2 feet square and 1 foot deep. The underground mark was a ~-inch copper bolt set in a granite block, 6 inches square and 1 foot deep, set 5 feet below the surface. A section of empty 4-inch sewer pipe was set over the subsurface mark and both stones and the pipe were surrounded by a mass of concrete 2 feet square at the base and 4 feet square at the surfac~ of the ground. This base is 9.2 kilometers in 1<.>ngth. The latitude of the middle point is 48° 3o', the longitude 96° 54', and the azimuth of the line 253° 19'. The soil on the western half of this base is a kind of gumbo, and is rather elastic when wet. The eastern half is more sandy and not so elastic. A man could not step near the posts on the gumbo section without causing a slight deflection. This probably affected the accuracy of the measures to some extent, particularly as the ground was very wet from frequent rains, but the effect was not sufficiently large to affect the residuals materially. See sections 6 to ro. ' The measurement of 'the base was delayed very materially by rains and strong winds. The measurement of sections 1 , 2, and 3 with steel tapes was made during a light drizzle, heavy enough to keep everything wet. The tape was wiped about every 4 or 5 tape lengths but was probably almost as wet after two tape lengths as at any time. Some of these measures were made in one direction before the mist became heavy enough to gather on the tape, hence these errors should show in the column of residuals. The agreement between the measurements with im:ar and with steel tapes is a further check upon the possible magnitude of these errors. , The residuals of the various sections on this base arc larger than on'2.ny other base measured this season. This may be attributed to three things, viz, bad weather conditions, movement of posts while standing or walking near them, and 'inexperience of the man who acted as forward tape stretcher.' Even on this base the accuracy is far within the limits required, as shown by the instructions given at the beginning of this appendix. The height of West Base is 253.4928 meters, as fixed by.precise leveling connected with the precise leveling net. The height of Hast Base, obtained from the levels over the base, is 268.509 meters, and the average height of the base is 259.864 meters. The reduction to mean sea level for the base, computed in the same manner as for Point Isabel Base, is - 375.1 millimeters. The grade on this base was very uniform, there being only one tape length where the middle support had to be elevated above the line joining the two end supports. There was only one tape length where the slope was more than 2 per cent and only four where it was more than 1 per cent. Grain or grass had to be cut on about half of the base in order to clear the tapes. Nearly all of the remainder of the base was through grain fields, but the measurement was completed before the grain was high enough to interfere with the work. Very little brush cutting was necessary. Only two roads were crossed by the base, and no fences. The site was almost an ideal one for measurement in dry weather. The following table shows the results of the measures of the various sections.

BROWN VALLEY BASE.

This base is in Roberts County, S. Dak., about 2~ miles west of the town of Brown Valley, Minn. The terminals were marked in the same manner as at Stephen Base, except that five-eighths-inch copper bolts were used for the surface marks instead of bronze station marks, and that at Southeast Base a cross was made in place of the drill hole. The base is 8.2 kilometers in length, the latitude of the middle point is 45° 35 1 ; the longitude 96° 52 1 , and the mean azimuth 149° 08 1 · Rain an~ strong winds caused some delay on this base also, but did not affect the accuracy materially. A large part of the measures at night were made with tapes and thermometers more or less wet, owing to the dews. Heavy rainfalls during the spring of 1906 caused two low places on the base to be filled with water to a depth of 2 feet or more at the time the measurement was.made. This made the posts project very considerably above the ground, as they had to be about o.6 meter above the water. Braces were nailed to both sides of each post, however, and no motion was noticeable during the work. The various measures over these sections (3, 4, and 5) agree very well, thus showing that the posts were apparently not disturbed by working around them. Nearly a kilometer of the base was through these ponds. When the base was located these low places were dry. The residerrts of that region said that these places were rarely wet, hence no attempt was made to locate to one side of them. Other than a little expense in the preparation of the base for measurement and the extra time necessary for measuring, where the water was over 2 feet in depth (not counting the discomfort of the men), there was no very material loss, in either expense or accuracy, due to the existence of these ponds on the line. No cutting of brush or timber was necessary. Considerable grass and grain had to be cut, however, along about half of the line, the remainder being through fields where

APPENDIX 4.

SIX BASES WITH STBEL AND INVAR TAPES.

the grass and .grain were not high enough to interfere with the tapes. Two frequently traveled roads were crossed by the line and three or four wire fences. The ground was nearly level along the base, there being only one tape length where it was necessary to raise the middle support above the line joining the end supports. There was no tape length with a greater slope than 3.8 per cent, only 6 over 2 per cent, and 25 over 1 per cent. The height of the base depends on the trigonometric leveling, controlled by three bench marks fixed by precise leveling connected with the precise level net. Each of the bench marks was a t.riangulation station and within two figures of the base, two to the north and one to the south of it. The probable error of the height of Northwest Base is about ±0.24 meter. The height of Northwest Base is 355.26 meters, that of Southeast Base 347.56 meters, and the average height of the whole base is 346.48 meters. The reduction to sea level for the base, computed in the same manner as for the Point Isabel Base, is - 447 .1 millimeters. The following tables show the results of the measures of the various sections. The measurements with steel tapes and with in var tapes were combined, and the probable errors computed, in the same manner as for the Point Isabel Base.

ROY ALTON HASE LINE.

Royalton Base is situated in the valley of the Mississippi River, in Benton County, Minn., east of the towns of Royalton and Rice. The terminals were marked in the same manner as at Stephen Base, a I-millimeter drill hole in each bronze station mark indicating the center of the -station. The base is

9.6 kilometers in length, the latitude of the middle point is 45° 43'; the longitude, 94° 14', and the mean azimuth of the line, 157° 10'. . The ground along the line is irregular, but not sufficiently so to cause many of the middle supports for the tapes to be raised above the line joining the end supports. There were 38 tape lengths where the slope was more than 2 per cent; and 3 more than 4 per cent, the maximum being 5. 1 per cent. Cutting of brush was required on only about 150 meters of the line, the greater part of the remainder being through grain fields. Rye fields, with the grain well advanced toward maturity, required cutting for about 4 kilometers of the line. Four roads and about ten fences were crossed by the base line. · The heights along the base depend upon an elevation of 323.19 meters'!' for Mississippi River Commission P. B. M. 8 Back Base, which is 1 917 meters from South Base, the connection being made by trigonometric leveling. The height of North Base is 348.127 meters; of South Base, 324.070 meters, and the average height of the base, 328.544 meters. The reduction to mean sea level, computed in the same manner as for Point Isabel Base, was-497.2 millimeters. The following table shows the results of the measures of the various sections. The measurements with steel and with invar tapes were combined, and the probable errors computed, in the same manner as for Point Isabel Base.

These small probable errors were obtained without any additional expenditure of money than would have been necessary to obtain merely a probable error of one part in.500 ooo, by a double measure with each kind of tape, as required by the instructions. The following table gives the probable error of the lengths of the bases from the steel and invar tapes independently, thus affording a means of comparing them more readily. In determining the probable error of the length of a base line in the preceding computations, the probable error due to the probable error of the comparator was applied after the results from the two kinds of tapes had been combined. It is here applied to the results obtained for each kind of tape independently. The quantities in columns 2 and 3 were collected from preceding pages. The probable error of the comparator was considered the same for both kinds of tapes. Each quantity in the fourth column is the square root of the sum of the squares of the corresponding quantities in the two preceding columns, anci shows the probable error of the length of the base as determined with steel and invar tapes separately.

The measurements with invar tapes are uniformly better than those with the steel, the probable errors of the former being about one-half those of the latter, except on the Royalton Base. Here measurements with steel tapes are exceptionally accordant, probably due to favorable and constant weather conditions. These probable en:ors for the measurements with steel tapes agree very well with those obtained in 1900,* hence the probable errors for the six bases measured with the invar tapes are directly comparable with previous tape measurements. The change from steel tapes to invar tapes is certainly accompanied by an increase in accuracy. Point Isabel Base controls the lengths at the southern end of the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian, and may be used to control the extension of this triangulation into Mexico by that Republic. Willamette and Tacoma bases and the Yolo Base of the 39th parallel triangulation control the lengths of the Pacific Coast triangulation from the middle of California to Puget Sound, a distance of .about 600 miles. Stephen and Brown Valley bases control the lengths of the lines on the north end of the ninety-eighth me!idian triangulation for about 350 miles. Royalton Base controls the lengths in one-half of the triangulation between the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation and the triangulation of the Great Lakes, near· Duluth, a distance of about 300 miles.
*See page 285, Appendix 3 of the Report for 1901, Nine Bases along the Ninety-eighth Meridian.

When compared with other instances where two forms of apparatus have been used on the measurement of a base these results are very gratifying. In the work of 1900 the duplex apparatus gave results differing from those with the tapes by one part in 175 ooo,* whereas the results with these two forms of tapes differ only one part in 527 ooo on an average, the greatest difference being but little more than one-half of the average for the work of 1900. There have been few, if any, instances where measures with two forms of base apparatus have .shown any better agreement than that between the duplex apparatus and steel tapes obtained in l 900. The fact that the discrepancy between the measurements with invar and steel tapes is of the same sign on five of the six bases seems to indicate a constant difference between measures with the two metals. The discrepancy on the Stephen Base, where the sign is opposite, should be omitted from this discussion, as the local conditions (such as wind, rain, and faulty tension) probably caused this reversal of sign. If this discrepancy be considered as due to errors of temperature, it would require· a constant error of 5° on the measures with invar tapes, or 0°.17 on the measures with steel tapes, to account for it. The temperatures obtained for invar tapes may be in error a degree, but are certainly not in error as much as 5°. An error of o 0 · 17 in determining the temperature of the steel tapes, however, either in the standardization or on the measures or on both, is not only possible but probable. These discrepancies may also be due, either partly or entirely, to the effect of wind on the tapes. The invar tapes are more sensitive to the wind than the steel, as the wide surface of the invar tapes was inclined to the horizontal plane to some extent. The· invar tapes were standardized where there was no wind effect. As ·there was always more or less wind during the measures it may have had more effect than was apparent at that time. Although few tape lengths were marked when any wind effect on the length of the tape was noticeable, still it was probably not entirely eliminated. Any error from this source is probably cumulative. Although the discrepancies between the measurements with the invar and steel tapes are small enough to be due to any one of the above causes, namely, errors in determination of the temperatures of the tapes, wind effects, errors due to moisture on the thermometers, or others, they are probably the result of a combination of all.
*See page 301, Appendix 3 of the Report for 1901, Nine Bases along the Ninety-eighth Meridian.

COST OF BASE MEASUREMENT.

The cm;t incurred in all the field operations in the measurement of the six base lines was $6 025. This includes all field expenses of the party, all transportation for party and outfit, beginning and ending in Washington, D. C., all field standardization, and salaries of officers. It does not include the cost of the triangulation executed by this party at Point Isabel, which was estimated as $700. Owing to the great distances traveled on this work, the expenses for transportation were about one-fourth of this total cost, practically the same in proportion as that obtained on measurement of 1900, notwithstanding the fact that only three men traveled from the East to the Pacific coast and one from the Pacific coast to Washington, D. C. The entire party was transported between the Willamette and Tacoma bases and between the Stephen, Brown Valley, and Royalton bases, but nowhere else. The costs of the February and October standardizations at the Bureau of Standards were about $300 and $175, respectively. The cost for standardization was large, owing to the extra work needed to study the properties of the invar tapes, as well as results obtained in the new comparator tunnel. The cost of the office computations and preparing the results for printing was $474. The total cost of the bases was, therefore, $6 974. The number of kilometers measured during the season was 60.54, hence the cost per kilometer was $115, which is less than three-fourths of the cost per kilometer for the work of 1900. One important item of economy of this work over the wbrk of 1900 is shown in the cost of the office computations, that for 1906 being only about one-third of the cost for 1900. If the invar tapes only had been taken into the field an·d all field standardization omitted, the cost per kilometer would have been about $94, as nearly as it can be estimated. This is but little more than one half the cost of the work of 1900, where nearly one-third of the measurements was made with bar apparatus. The cost of preparing the bases for measurement may be obtained from the last three bases with considerable accuracy, as this part of the work was executed by certain men who did nothing else. The first three bases could not be considered in this manner, as they were prepared by the measuring party. . The p~eparation of the last three bases was begun by five men on the 10th of June and ended on the 30th. As the actual cost of the various parts of this preparation may be interesting, the following table is appended:

All the expenses of this party, from the time it left the triangulation work until the completion of the preparation of the three bases, are included in this total. The erection of signal poles at the base terminals was required at only one of these bases.

SIX BASES WITH STEEL AND INVAR TAPES.

ISI

The speed of setting posts for tape supports varies with the character of the soil and the topography of the base. On this season's work a party of five usually set posts at the rate of from 3 to 4 kilometers a day.
SPEED ATTAINED.

The following tables show the speed attained on the various bases, and also the actual time spent on the measures. The time given includes all operations from the beginning of the measure to the end, but does not include the time required to get the tapes ready for the work. The copp~r marking strips were usually nailed to the tops of the posts as the first measure was being made. This delayed the regular work by about five minutes per kilometer; hence, as the first measurement was usually made with the invar tapes, the rate per kilometer for the invar tapes as shown in the last column has been increased on this account, the time intervals shown in the third column not having been reduced.

These tables show the effect of experience in observers and other members of the party very effectually. Point Isabel Base was measured with inexperienced men. On the Willamette Base the observers only had had experience and they merely on one base. Tacoma Base may be considered as measured with experienced men. At Stephen, again, a new party had to be trained. The new observer had, however, had considerable work of exactly this character several years before, hence required very little practice to become proficient again. This party, with the same two observers, continued for three bases and on the last base made the greatest average speed attained. The speed depends almost entirely upon the experience of the observers, rather than the remainder of the party, as is shown very clearly in these tables. The means at the bottom of these tables show that the speed attained with the invar tapes is 1 .08 times as great:- as that with the steel tapes. · This gain in speed was due almost entirely to the greater convenience of working in daylight.
ERRORS OF TAPE MEASURES.

The errors affecting measurements with tapes have been fully treated in Appendix
8 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1892, Part 2, and in Appendix 3 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1901, pages 295-300. The errors in grade cor-

rections and reductions to sea level are small and practically of the compensating class, hence do not affect the length of a base materially. The effects of errors of alignment are negligible, an error of a decimeter in a single tape length being necessary to produce a change in length of a tenth of a millimeter. An error of one centimeter in

alignment in a tape length of 50 meters would cause a change in length of only 0.001 millimeter, or, if every tape length in the kilometer were out of parallelism a centimeter, the effect would be merely 0.02 millimeter on a kilometer. As the.aligning was done with a good theodolite using short sights, there was probably no tape length in whic~ the lack of parallelism to the base exceeded a centimeter, hence the error of alignment is probably much less than 0.02 millimeter per kilometer. The errors due to observation are more or less co~pensating and are developed to some extent in the results of the different measures of each section. The effects of errors of tension are neither well known nor as well compensated as could be desired. It is very difficult to hold the exact tension on the balance long enough to make an accurate marking of the tape length. Another source of error with the form of balance used is the change in the strength of the spring, or a shifting of the index hand on its pivot. The latter can usually be detected by holding the balance up by its own· hook and noting the reading of the hand. This was done frequently during the measures and especially after the balance happened to receive a sudden jerk from any cause. Two balances were kept as standards, and the working balances compared with them almost every day. That reading on the balance which corresponded to an actual t.ension of 15 kilograms was always used in the measures. Changes of IO grams to 25 grams in the reading of the balance for a 15-kilogram tension were discovered several times. A few instances occurred where a shifting of the hand was noted and'the measures corrected accordingly. Occasionally a complete revolution of the hand, or 5 kilograms, occurred without being detected on the balance by the tape stretcher, recorder, or forward observer. The last could not tell very well, even by lifting the tape at the support, whether the tension was IO or I 5 kilograms, the position of the line on the spring bar not being easily seen, as it was almost it meters from the graduation mark on the tape. A steel and an invar tape were tested in the field for a change in tension from 15 to IO kilograms. The invar tape showed a change of 9.5 millimeters, and the steel tape, 7.7 millimeters. These values were used for corrections wherever an error of 5 kilograms in tension was discovered. There may be a few of these errors uncorrected yet, as there were several sections where the difference between the measures indicated some such error. No time was taken to try to locate them by investigating the copper strips, as the errors were not large enough to be of serious consequence, and the instructions to the party would not warrant any delay for such investigations nor permit a remeasure. The effect of small errors in the tension may be seen by taking the values found by experiment at the Bureau of Standards for ii:ivar tapes Nos. 437 and 438. A change in tension of 25 grams caused a change in length of 0.04 millimeter for a tape length, or o.8 millimeter per kilometer. As this is of a compensating character to a great extent, and the errors of tension are not often as large as 25 grams, this source of error can not affect the length of a base very materially. Another source of small errors was the marking awl used on part of the work, particularly on the Tacoma and Stephen Bases. The points would break very easily, and sometimes all of the awls had broken points before the completion of a day's measure. As it was not considered of sufficient consequence to warrant delaying the work to sharpen them, there are a few small errors on this account. They were rarely as great as a quarter millimeter per tape length, however, and were of a compensating character.

TEMPERATURE ERRORS.

The effect of errors in determining the true temperature of the tapes is probably not very great. The range of temperature during the measur'ement of a section with steel tapes was small. The thermometers probably indicated the actual tem.perature of the tape very closely. On a large portion of the measures with steel tapes the atmosphere was so damp that mbisture collected on the thermometers, and may have caused them to indicate erroneous temperatures.. An inspection of the residuals of the various measures of such sections did not reveal any appreciable error from this source, at least nothing cert:I;inly distinguishable from other errors. The temperatures obtained for the invar tapes are undoubtedly erroneous to a small extent, but the coefficient of expansion is so small that an error of a degree in temperature causes an error of only 0.4 millimeter in the length of a kilometer, or one part in 2 500 ooo. With the thermometers on the top of the invar tape, the temperature of the tape is probably obtained within a degree. On Point Isabel Base and part of the Willamette Base a thermometer was fastened to the bottom of the invar tapes (outside of the graduation marks) and read at the same time the others were read. This thermometer indicated a lower temperature, by about a degree, than the others, as it was shaded by its metal back, as well as by the tape. If this lower temperature were used,it would make the lengths of the bases greater, thus increasing the discrepancy between the measurements with the invar and steel tapes, except on one base where other conditions have produced a difference in the opposite direction . . This apparently shows that the thermometers on top of the tapes indicate too low a temperature for the invar tapes rather than too high.
CONCLUSIONS.

The following are a few conclusions which have been deduced from the season's work with these invar tapes. · The invar tapes may be handled and manipulated in identically the same manner as steel tapes. A little caution is necessary, of course, to prevent giving them small bends, at least to a radius of less than 8 inches, but this causes no material delay. All measurements with invar tapes may bt; made during daylight, but measurements with steel tapes must be made at night in order to secure the desired accuracy. In daylight work the errors of observation are smaller, the tapes can be watched more carefully and kept clear of obstructions and moisture, greater accuracy is possible since the party can work more comfortably when each member can see what he is doing, and more speed may be obtained as the party can see to work and travel without bothering with lights. Any error due to the failure. of the thermometers to indicate the temperature of the tapes is probably much less for measures with invar tapes than with steel, as an error of 2°.8 is necessary to produce as large an error in measures with these invar tapes as an error of 0°.1 will produce in measures with steel tapes. This effect is probably not.more than three or four times as great in daylight as at night; hence .the temperature errors from this source are probably eight or ten times as great for the measures with steel tapes as for those with invar tapes.

APPENDIX 4.

SIX BASES WITH STEEL AND INVAR TAPES.

155

The cost for the measures with invar tapes is very materially less than for the with steel tapes, as it is not necessary to standardize the invar tapes in the field, and consequently the heavy iced-bar apparatus is not needed. Standardization at the Bureau of Standards is cheaper. than in the field, since the comparator is already prepared and a smaller party is required for the work. The fact that the tapes may be standardized by different observers from those who make the field measures is probably of very little consequence, as in the standardizat.iori all pointings are made with microscopes, and in the base measurement, ordinarily' no magnifying power is used. Consequently, there is likely to be as much of a personal equation between the work of standardization ·and the field measures whether the two operations are performed by the same observers or by different ones. The work of 1900 proved that measures with steel tapes at night were as accurate as measures with bar apparatus and very much more economical. This season's work . has shown that measures with invar tapes in daylight are decidedly more accurate and economical than with steel tapes. · In the future a base line may be introduced into a triangulation scheme with very little increase in expense or delay to the triangulation. Invar tapes may be· standardized at the Bureau of Standards and sent to the triangulation party when required. This party is usually capable of making the measures without additional help, the work of the triangulation being interrupted merely long enough for the measurement when the base iine is reached. No travel would be required in this case, and the actual cost of the base may be reduced to $75 per kilometer, or even less. The length would then be available for the computations as soon as the angle measures were obtained.

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY BETWEEN JULY r, 1906, AND JUNE 30, 1907.
By"R. L.
FARIS,

Inspector of Magnetic Work and Chief of Division of Terrestrial Magnetism, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic
Survey.

INTRODUCTION.

The present publication contains the results of magnetic observations made on land and at sea by officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the prosecution of the magnetic survey of the United States and outlying territories, during the period July l, 1906, to June 30, 1907.* Five magnetic observatories t have been in continuous operation throughout the year: At Cheltenham, Md.; Baldwin, Kans.; Sitka, Alaska; near Honolulu, Hawaii; and on Vieques Island, Porto Rico. In April, 1907, the instruments at Vieques were moved from old Fort Isabel, where observations had been made since February, 1903, and installed in a building especially constructed for use as a magnetic observatory, about half a mile west of the fort. There will be found in the tables the values of the magnetic elements at each of the observatories, as based on the observations of December and January. ·
OBSERyATIONS ON LAND AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

The distribution of the stations "on land is shown in the following table, from which it will be seen that the work of the year, though distributed over 37 States and Territories, was principally in the West and Northwest, in regions where comparatively few observations had been made previously. The difficulties of travel and transportation in those regions are largely responsible for the fact that the number of stations occupied during the year was smaller than usual. "Repeat" observations were made at 78 places d,istributed over the whole country, in order to follow as closely as possible the

OBSERVATIONS AT SEA AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

Magnetic observations have been made at sea as often as the regular surveying duties of the ships of the Bureau would permit. Observations were made by the Bache during her cruises from Norfolk, Va., to Maine and return, and from Norfolk to Porto Rico and return; by the Explorer on her cruises from Norfolk to Massachusetts and return, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific coasts by way of the Straits of Magellan; and by the Patterson between Seattle, Wash., and Kodiak, Alaska. The work of the Explorer is especially worthy of note. She left Norfolk, Va., in February and was at Magdalena Bay, Mexico, at the close of the fiscal year. During practically all this time she encountered very favorable weather conditions, and as a result it was possible to make a very full series of magnetic observations. Shore observations were made at 12

places, at most of which observations had been made before, thus furnishing valuable secular variation data. At sea observations of the three elements were made duririg 29 complete swings of the ship with both port ·and starboard helms, and numerous additional observations were secured on the course and two points either side of the course. The records of these observations were not received in time to include the results in this Appendix. The results of observations at sea which are published herewith are distributed as follows:

GENERAL METHODS OF OBSERVING.
LAND WORK.

The methods of observing have been the same as those described in previous publications. Observers engaged exclusively in magnetic work are supplied with a complete outfit, consisting of theodolite magnetometer, dip circle, half-second pocl;cet chronometer, observing tent, and small accessories, while those who are expected to get magnetic results incidental to other work are supplied with more or less complete outfits, according to circumstances. Where only declination results can be secured under the conditions involved, a compass declinometer is supplied; but to those who can attempt more, a dip circle with compass attachment is furnished, with which compact outfit, knowing the azimuth of some reference mark fr:om triangulation or other source, the declination, dip, and total intensity (Lloyd's method) can be obtained with a very fair degree of accuracy.
SEA WORK.

The Bache, Explorer and Patters'on are each provided with a Lloyd-Creak dip circle and accompanying gimbal stand, by means of which dip and total intensity can be determined on board ship. Observations for declination (or "variation") are made with the usual standard liquid compass and an azimuth circle of the Ritchie or Negus pattern. Each value of declination, dip, or intensity usually depends upon the mean of observations made on 8 or 16 equidistant headings while steaming in a circle, once with port and once with starboard helm. In some cases, however, observations were made on three headings, namely, on the course, one or two points to starboard of the course, then a like amount to port, and finally on the course again. In the report for I 905 attention was called to the fact that the Lloyd-Creak dip circle, as originally constructed, could not be used to determine the total intensity in

low magnetic latitudes. The experience on the Carnegie Institution magnetic survey vessel, the Galilee, with dip circle No. 35, which was modified last year, proved so satisfactory that the dip circles of the E!plorer and Patterson were this year modified in the same manner, except that rto astronomic telescope was added. (See Appendix 3, for 1906, page 112.) In the case of the Explorer this was necessary, as on her cruise from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast she crossed the magnetic equator twice. She was also provided with a magnetometer so that the intensity constant of the dip circle could be determined at each place where shore observations were made.
AQ2URACY OF RESUI,TS.

The endeavor in general is to secure, on land, declination and dip observations whose absolute error (including everything involved-error of observation and reduction) shall not exceed 2', and to determine the horizontal intensity within r part in 1 ooo. As stated in previous reports, the experience of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has been that, under all of the conditions involved in a campaign of field work covering a large area, including the standardization of instruments anp the determination of reduction errors, this accuracy can not be much increased. In observatory work with special instruments, or when special investigations are made under the best conditions by special observers, there is no difficulty of reducing these limits of error; but in a large organization, where results must be secured from all kinds of observers, under all conditions, and at times under great physical difficulties, and when all sources of error are considered, the degree of accuracy stated must be regarded as satisfactory and sufficient. It happens, of course, that these limits, for one reason or another, are occa~ sionally exceeded, and there may be a few isolated cases in which the errors are two or three times the amounts given.
COMPARISON OF INSTRUMENTS.

Comparisons of field instruments with the standard instruments of the Cheltenham Observatory have been made when conditions demanded it or opportunity offered. In order. to compare the magnetic instruments of the Cheltenham and Mount Weather Observatories, observations were made at Cheltenham with a set of portable instruments from the Mount Weather Observatory and at Mount Weather with a magnetometer which had been in use at Cheltenham. At Sitka a full set of observations was made to restandardize the instruments which had been used by Captain Amundsen for his observations in the vicinity of the magnetic north pole. Some comparisons were also made at Baldwin Observatory. But few changes were required in the instrumental corrections used last year. The various dip circles used and the corrections which have been applied to the results by each are given in the following table. The figures after the decimal point in the fourth .column indicate, as in the past, the particular needles to which the correction applies.

The correction to Magnetometer No. 22 the Honolulu Observatory instrument, was assigned as the result of comparison with four different magnetometers with which observations had also been made at Cheltenham. The values of H determined with this instrument, heretofore published, should be increased accordingly. Magnetometer No. 36 was overhauled in January, 1907 and some of the fittings of the long magnet had to be renewed, hence the change in the correction. The correctio_n for No. 17 should be applied to the results of observations with that magnetometer, published in Appendix 3 for 1906. Index corrections have been applied to declination results obtained with compass declinometer or compass needle. In addition the results with several magnetometers. have been corrected by small amounts, as the result of careful comparison with standard instruments.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1907. REDUCTION OF THE OBSERVATIONS.

A first computation is made by the observer in the field, and he is instructed to carry it far enough before he leaves a station to assure himself that the desired degree of accuracy has been attained. This computation is carefully revised in the Office, in the Division of Terrestrial Magnetism, and the necessary corrections are applied to reduce the results to the .standard instruments, as indicated in the foregoing section. Each value of the magnetic declination is then corrected to reduce it to the mean of the particular .month in which the observation was made, with the aid of the continuous observations at the nearest magnetic observatory, allowance being made for the change in diurnal variation, with change in magnetic latitude. No attempt has been made to correct the dip and horizontal intensity for diurnal variation.
ARRANGEMENT OF TABLES.
LAND OBSERVATIONS.

The values of declination, dip, and horizontal intensity presented in Table I are arranged by States alphabetically, the results for each State being given in the order of increasing latitudes. The latitudes and ,longitudes are in most cases the result of solar observations made with the small theodolite which forms a part of the magnetometer. In default of observations the geographic coordinates were scaled from the best available map, either the United States Geological Survey topographic sheets, a Post Route map, or a Rand & McNally State map. In such cases only the nearest whole minute of latitude and longitude is given. The horizontal intensity is expressed as heretofore in terms of the one hundred thousandth part of a C. G. S. unit of intensity of magnetic force, termed a gamma, and designated by the letter y. In order to include the desired amount of information in the available space the following abbreviations were adopted. Only the month and day of the date are given, since the observations were all made between July 1, 1906, and June 30, 1907, except when otherwise stated in footnote. The names of the months have been abbreviated, as follows:
January February March April Ja Fe Mh Ap May My June Je July Jy August Au September October November December Se Oc No De

In .the column headed "Instruments" M stands for "magnetometer" and D. C. for "dip circle." Halicised numbers in the magnetometer column indicate that the declination was determined with a compass declinometer of the number given. When the declination was determined with the compass attachment of the dip circle the letter C is· placed in the magnetometer column. The dip circles have been given the designations indicated on page 163, the figures after the decimal point denoting the needles used. Values of horizontal intensity printed in italics were obtained by combining the observed dip with the total intensity determined by Lloyd's method.

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS. Magnetic observers are instructed to mark every station in as permanent a manner . as possible, either with a stone or a post of some durable· wood, so that it may be available for future occupation. They are also. required to furnish a sufficiently detailed description to locate the station, even if the marking should be destroyed, and to determine the bearing of two or three prominent objects in addition to the one used as reference mark in the .azimuth and declination observations. The information is given in abridged form on the following pages for each of the stations occupied during the year. Further details can usually be obtained. on application to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The usual method of marking a station is by a stone post about 3 feet long and 6 or 8 inches square, set so as to project an inch or two above ground, and lettered on top U. S. C. & G. S., with a drill hole in the center to mark the exact point, Whenever the local authorities desired and were willing to bear the expense a second stone was set to denote the true meridian. The descriptions of stations are arranged alphabetically by States and by names of station.
ALABAMA.

Fort Morgan, Baldwin County.-The magnetic station is in an open space in a pine grove, southeast of the end of the row of officers' quarters, southwest of the large wooden water tank, and 147.6 feet north of a group of live oak trees. The station is 234.2 feet from the iron flow pipe at the center of the water tower, 351 .5 feet from the northwest corner of the Peace Storage Magazine, and 303.5 feet north of the ammunition track. The station is marked by a 4 l;>y 26 inch sewer tile filled with cement placed flange down, being flush with the surface of the ground. A ~-inch copper wire projecting one-fourth of an inch, marks the center of station. The letters U. S. C. & G. S., 1907, were traced on the surface of the cement. The following true bearings were determined:

MANUAL OF TIDES-PART V

CURRENTS, SHALLOV\T-WATER ,TIDES, METEOROLOGICAL TIDES, AND MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS

By ROLLIN A. HARRIS

Blank page retained for pagination

PREFACE.
This paper, constituting the concluding chapters of a manual of tides, treats of a variety of matters more or less connected with the main subject. The other parts appeared in the reports of the Survey for the years 1894, 1897, 1900, and 1904. Chapter I treats of the motion of liquids, with special reference to the possible modes of flow and the nature of the resistance experienced. Chapter II considers in some detail the kind of resistance (dissipation) which practically controls the principal ocean tides. Chapter III is devoted to the discussion of shallow-water or river tides. Airy's treatment of this subject is slightly ext~nded and is compared with more recent work. The peculiarities of many tide curves are accounted for in this chapter, but others defy explanation. A conclusion is drawn as to the fonns of estuaries from the known laws of friction. Chapter IV treats of the combinations of motions such as occur in connection with currents and tides. Special points styled ''circular points,'' or points where the tidal current never slackens, are described. Chapter V treats of the observation of currents and modes of reciucing the observed data. Chapter VI with the included maps, tables, and quotations contains most of the available information concerning tidal·currents which seems likely to throw light upon the oscillations in oceanic basins. Observational data for the coasts of the United States are given in considerable detail. The greater portion of this matter has been worked up during the past two years. The connection between the observed tides and currents is, in many cases, pointed out and briefly explained. A few matters relating to marine engineering comprise Chapter VII. One of the principal aims of Chapter VIII is to point out the causes which produce the annual meteorological tides, and to briefly consider the causes of ocean currents. In Chapter IX the question of seiche oscillations is considered for both open and closed bodies. It appears from this discussion that regular oscillations observed even in small partially-foclosed harbors depend, as a rule, directly upon the dimensions of such harbors rather than upon the dimensions of the sea with which they are connected. Chapter X treats of lake tides, and shows from observations that Lake Superior very nearly obeys the equilibrium theory. Chapter XI is to some extent supplementary to the other parts of the manual, particularly to Part III. As usual, the author has received assistance from other members of the Tidal Division of the Survey· in the preparation of the tables contained in and following the text.

CHAPTER I.
FLOW AND RESISTANCE.
1.

The flow of water in uniform canals and pipes.

Before about the middle of the last century it was commonly assumed that the greatest velocity of a stream should, except for the effect of winds, be found at the surface. Various assumptions were made as to 'the law of veiocity decrease in going downward. Among the curves taken to represent the velocities were: A parabola with , vertical axis, the vertex being placed beneath the b~d of the stream; a sloping straight line; an ellipse; and a logarithmic curve. Raucourt (b. 1°779, d. 1841) from observations upon the Neva, believed. that the velocities could be represented by the ordinates of a vertical ellipse whose minor axis lies a little below the surface and the lower extremity of whose major axis lies a little below the bottom of the river. When the river was frozen over, the maximum velocity was found to be a little below middle depth. Boileau, about 1850, obtained from his mear.urements of the Mosel, at Metz, a parabola with horizontal axis along the surface, whose equation could be "written

u=A-Bz9',
z denoting depth helm~ the surface, the measurements being taken iii the main current. However, this equation does not apply to the part of the velocity curve above the line of maximum velocity where the· velocities are assumed to follow another curve. For a small canal i~ which he experimented, he fo~md the maximum velocity to occur below the surface from one-fourth to one-fifth of the water's depth. From observations made on the Irrawaddy, Gordon found the line of greatest velocity to lie as a rule at one-tenth of the depth, and in a few cases at from two-tenths to four-tenths. The velocities change rapidly in going from the shore to the center of a stream. Humphreys and Abbot found that at Columbus, Ky., the velocities of the Mississippi River 5 feet below the surface vary according to the law of a parabola; also thatThe parameter of the curve of \·elocities 5 feet below the surface at any stage is proportional to the square root of the corresponding mean velocity of the river.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

From their· measurements of the velocities of the lower Mississippi, Humphreys anci Abbot drew the following conclusions:
The veiodties at different depths below the surface, ii1 a vertical plane, \'ary as the ahscissre of a parabola whose axis is the axis of ,\'and parallel to the water surface. The position of the axis in rnlm weather is about three-tenths of the depth helow the surface, whatever be the mean velocity of the river. The effect of the wincl, whether blowing up or down stream, is directly proportional to iL~ force, in the former case lowering and in the latter raising the axis. Also, the amount of such lowering or raising is independent of the mean velocity of the river.*

From their work it is evident that even if the wind had the velocity and direction of the stream -the maximum velocity would still be found below the surface and at nearly three-te1.1ths of the entire depth. This fact seems to oppose the theory that the resistance of the atmosphere is necessary for causing the position of greatest velocity to lie below the surface. Bazin assumes the velocity curve for a regular canal to be an ordinary parabola with its axis horizontal; he finds this to lie from o to 0.2 of the total depth below the surface for natural channels, and as deep as o. 35 for some artificial channels. t The relative velocities for different pa,rts of the cross section of rectangular conduits and open canals; also of open canals of trapezoidal, triangular, and semicircular section, are given by Darcy and Ba.zin on Plates XVIII-XXIII of their Recherches Hydrauliques. The velocity curves for a canal of rectangular cross section are roughly parabolic in both horizontal and vertical planes. When the canal is open, the parabolic velocity curve of the vertical plane has its vertex somewhat below the surface. Their experiments show that the air-resistance is not the most important factor in depressing the thread of maximum velocity. That considerable transverse motion occurs in a stream flowing along an open channel is obvious from the most casual observations made upon floating objects. That vertical motion also occurs is not so evident because of the difficulty in following water particles below the surface. In 1867 Mr. James B. Francis, at Lowell, Mass., experimented upon the cross flow of water currents in uniform canals by discharging whitewash at points near the hottom and noting when and how far downstream it would appear at the surface. t He says:
From these experiments it appears that the water at the bottom of the streams came to the surface at distances varying from ahout ten to thirty times the depth, the shorter distances being in the canal of the least depth and most uneven bed.

But he also states that the whitewash continued to come to the surface for a considerable portion of the time which the part first appearing required in ascending from the bottom to the surface. Observation curves showing the manner in which the velocity diminishes from the center to the sides of canals with vertical sides are given by James B. Francis, on Plate XVII of his Lowell Hydraulic Experiments, and described in sections 207 and 208 of that

work. He notes that the velocity at any given point, or rather at any given part of the section, varies continually, although the mean velocity for the whole section remains sensibly constant. This he attributes to an interchange of the currents. In a general way the velocity curves are parabolic. According to measurements made by \V. E. Spear, the tidal currents in Boston Harbor have maximum velocities at considerable depths below the. surface.* The velocity curves resemble parabolas. If a stream be covered with ice, the maximum velocity lies one-third or more of the way down from the surface. For broken and tilted ice, this fraction may be increased to one-half or more. i" · Dr, E. C. Murphy draws the following conclusions from observations made at the hydraulic laboratory at Cornell University. The canal is 16 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and 415 feet in length.
The thread of the maximum vt:locities is at the surface for depths less than 2 feet and unobstructed flow at the lower end of the canal. For depths of 5 feet or mon1 and discharge checked at the lower end of the canal this thread is from 0.2 to 0-4 depth below the surface, the mean for 21 experiments being 0.31 depth. The position of the thread of mean velocity varies from o. 5 depth for small depths to o. 73 depth for larger depths. For the 31 experiments by the ordinary method of series C and D it is 0.64 depth below the surface. , In ordinary streams where the depth varies from ahout I to 6 feet, the thread of mean velocity is about o.6 [of the entire depth] below the surface. :j:

Cross-sectional velocity variation connected witlt tlze constant of resistance.

Observation shows that the velocity is greatest along the axis of a canal and least near the sides and bottom. For simplicity, first suppose the canal so deep that the effect of the bottom may be neglected. Every elementary mass may be supposed to cross the canal while traveling downstream or onward a distance equal to q, on the average; the mass may not actually cross the stream while traveling this distance, but its transverse motions are such that so far as affecting the onward flow is concerned they may be supposed to give way to this hypothetical uniform crossing. For, the cross-sectional variation in velocity being a continu'uus and unifonn function of the distance from the axis of the stream, alLtransverse motions of the particles will imply determinate losses of energy. As an element leaves the axis of the stream it loses a portion of its energy. In this way each element takes away (periodically on the average) energy from the energy of the -·-----·---- - - - - - - - -

stream. The impacts of the elements set up rotations and other cross m_otions. .These rotations and cross motions are diffused throughout the liquid, and their maintenance against viscosity requires the expenditure of considerable energy, which is eventually converted into heat. They become apparent when lime water or other colored liquid is mixed with the water. The diminution in velocity shows how much energy per element is lost to the stream dnring an excursion of an element from the axis to one side and back again. If vc denotes the velocity at the center and v~ at the side or bank, the energy which must be supplied to each unit mass while the latter travels a distance q in order to maintain the flow is

Assuming, for the moment that the velocity of a stream is greatest at the surface, and that the resistance due to the bottom is similar to that due to one side in the case just considered, it follows that b can be replaced by 2/t and that 2/t/ q is the average upward slope of an ascending element, i q being the x-distance over which a particle placed at the bottom travels before reaching the surface. In Francis's experiments 2h ,· q varies from one-ten~h to one-thirtieth or less. This rapid ascension is in part due to transverse or upward' motions of the particles in addition to the motion of the element as a whole. Moreover, for some of .the particles 2/t I q is considerable less than one-thirtieth.

etc., according as 2, 3, 4, etc., terms· are assumed to occur in the brackets. In case u does not contain x-that is, in case the velocity of a particular thread or depth is the same at all cross sections of a uniform canal-then w (the x-axis coinciding with the nearly horizontal bottom) will be zero at all depths regardless of the nature of the z-function in the brackets. Hence it is kinematically possible to have at a given time and depth any constant velocity for all points situated at the given depth. But the constant velocities belonging to the other depths may differ in any manner whatever amongst themselves, or from the velocity belonging to the depth to which attention is directed. In reality the manner in which uniform flow can take place is limited or defined ·by the nature of the external and internal resistances. According to statements made in section 1 concerning the motions of the particles, the velocity in a broad canal should be a parabola whose vertex lies somewhat below the surface, unless the bottom is rough; in which case the maximum velocity may be at the surface. When F contains x, the simplest mode of flow is that where B=o, and where no further terms occur in the coefficients. This means that water moves in vertical slices, all of whose particles travel the same horizontal distance. This is evidently an impossible case on account of the resistance at the bottom. The next mod~ in order of simplicity is that where coefficient.

If u cotitains x, because the depth is subject to small gradual changes, it can be shown that the simplest possible type of steady motion is that in which the velocity curve is a parabola with vertex one-third of the depth of the stream below its surface. Let u and w be written thus,

Let /z denote the average depth for a distance over which the depth changes by only a small fractio1i of itself. z is supposed to be reckoned from the nearly horizontal bottom. The expressions in the brackets have nearly constant values at each crosssection of the reach consid~red. For another reach, h may have a sensibly diffen~nt value. But in each case the simplest possible mode of flow is the parabolic kind referred to above. This will apply to reach after reach whose depth variations are everywhere gradual. Even if a stream in an earlier part of its course flowed over a bed not of the kind here supposed, the effects upon its flow will, later on, practically disappear and the parabolic mode of flow be finally established if the length of the stream over tolerably even bed be sufficiently great. As the observed velocity curve approaches in form a parabola of the second order, the depth of maximum velocity will approach th. As already noted, roughness of the bed, or a shallowing of the stream, throws the line of maximum velocity nearer to the surface. A channel broader at the top than at the bottom has its line of maximum velocity raised, and vice versa for one narrow at the.top and broad at the bottom.

4. Kinds

if res/stance.

If a solid be held in a fixed position while the adjacent liquid has a steady flow, or if the solid move while the liquid remains at rest, three kinds of resistance will generally be experienced: skin friction, resistance due to impact, implying discontinuous motion, and generally some wave resistance. Viscosity proper-i. e., the force required to overcome the shear of the elements as one lamina moves over a neighboring lamina-will not be considered here, as it is probably of little consequence. But its indirect effect is of great importance, as will presently be seen. A resistance (dissipation) described in the next chapter is a species of wave resistance.

5. Skin friction as varying on account

if the velocity.

If an elementary mass of water move through or into a larger mass of water having less velocity than the given element has, the latter experiences a retarding force; some of the original energy will be retained in the element, some will be utilized in directly helping along the neighboring particles, and some will be consumed, i. e., turned into

COAST AND GEODETIC SVRVEY REPORT, 1907.

heat. The change of motion experienced is quite analogous to 'that resulting from the impact of inelastic bodies. For, i1nagine a long pipe or canal filled with very small elastic balls. Let the whole collection of them move forward because of gravity or pressure. If they impinge against an object, or if the size of the pipe suddenly change, the chance is very small that important rebounds, like those belonging to a single ball, will take place for a considerable portion of the mass of balls, because the forces resulting from the impacts are largely consumed in moving and rotating the particles among themselves and in urging forward any balls which may lag behind in the rebound. Thus the aggregate of these assumed elastic balls behaves nearly like an aggregate of inelastic balls. With greater reason a liquid will so behave because the particles are indefinitely small. For perfectly inelastic bodies, M', M", moving with velocities v', v'' in the same direction, the velocity after their impact is

M' v'+M" v"

,-M;+M"

'

because the quantity of motion remains unaltered. Now, if v' and v" before impact be each increased n-fold, so will be the velocity after impact. Since the diminutions hi the velocities of" a large portion of the liquid, especially near a solid or solid boundary, may be considered as depending upon impacts, it follows that such diminutions in velocities probably bear nearly fixed ratios to the general velocity of the stream, whatever be the actual value of the latter, within tolerably wide limits. The average force imparted to the boundary walls when the velocity of an element of
2 unit mass is reduced from its maximum value, v1 , to its minimum value, v2 , is :(v/:--v 2 ) +s , 2

where s denotes the distance along the stream between successive points of minimum velocity of the dement as it pursues its slightly undulating or sinuous path. Assume that all motions are geometrically similar., Because of this assumption, when v1 becomes nv11 z12 will become nv2 , while s remains the same as before. The energy in either case divided by the length of the path s is the average value of the resisting force acting upon the element. These forces are therefore to each other as 1 'is to n 2 · Hence the resisting force when two scales of velocities are employed is proportional to the square of the velocity, i. e. to the square of the initial velocity of the element, or velocity at a certain point in the cross section. Consider now a rigid body immersed in a uniformly flowing stream. Observations indicate that there is a film of water adhering to the body, otherwise there would be a slipping along the surface of the body. The influence of this film extends outward to a considerable distance in accordance with some law not \·:ell understood. A moving element enters the zone of retarded flow which forms a sort of cushion around the rigid body. For any symmetrical surface the impinging particles produce a ,dragging force upon the body, whose resultant effect acts in approximately the direction of flow. As has just been seen, this portion of the force of impact is' proportional to the square of the velocity of the stream. But nothing here stated contemplates a comparison between bodies of different shapes or sizes. All that it is intended to show is, assuming the flows are geometrically alike for different scales of velocity, that what is commonly known as the skin friction upon a body is proportional to the square of the velocity.

This resistance arises from changes in the velocities of the moving liquid elements as they enter the field of influence of the rigid body. For the resistance due to impact and which does not imply changes in the magnitudes of the velocities, see section 12.
6. Skt'n .frictt'on as varyt'ng on account

ef the areas ef the

rigt'd boundart'es.

Suppose that we compare the resistance found in a given long pipe or canal with the resistance experienced in a pipe or canal ·whose cross section is similar to that of the former, but whose length and diameter or width are not the same as before. As already intimated, the resistance to a moving liquid involves what may be termed a misdirection of the particles, and that this in turn is primarily due to the adhesion of a liquid film to the rigid boundary, to viscosity, and to sensible irregularities of the boundary. That is, because of the adhesion and viscosity, however small they may be, a deflecting force must exist (particularly near the boundaries),· which sooner or later will cause the rapidly moving particles to enter regions of less onward motion and even to arrive so near the boundary that the motion becomes much diminished. It may be laid down as the fundamental property of liquid flow in long pipes or canals that each particle will in time occupy all cross-sectional positions of the stream from the axis to the boundary. For short pipes or canals the same tendency to exchange positions 'is going on, but particles may leave these conduits before experiencing great transverse displacements. The qu~stion as to how viscosity an!f the presence of rigid boundaries can cause deflect-ions of the particles need not be discussed. It may, however, be noted that since the side of a particle toward the axis of the stream is urged forward by the adjacent liquid while the side toward the rigid boundary is retarded,· there must be a couple tending to produce rotation, such that the forward part of the particle is crowded toward the boundary. But the result when all particles are considered is sinuous fl.ow. In a uniform pipe or canal the impacts of the forward-directed elements against those moving slower produce a traction which is ultimately exerted along the boundary. The continuity of the liquid in a pipe or canal does, in a sense, prescribe the paths of the particles, and these paths may, in the long run, all be considered as alike in all respects. Now, whatever element is followed, it attains the maximum velocity near the axis of the pipe and later on loses this velocity and attains a minimum velocity near the bounding walls. If two long pipes have the same diameter but differ only in length, then, by what has just been said, the geometrical character of the flow in each is identical. For, the number of minimum velocities experienced by the elements in the two cases will be directly proportional t~ the lengths; and the forces required to impart a given motion to the particles, which at intervals, regular in the long run, lose a certain part of their maximum velocity, must be proportional to the number of elements concerned. If the pipes have the same length but differ only in diameter, it is reasonable to assume that the number of minima experienced by the particles in the two cases will be inversely proportional to the diameter. ·This will evidently be so if the motions are geometrically similar. The amount of matter to which the forces must impart velocities is directly proportional to the area o~ the cross section of the pipe. But the number of minimum
1

C:OAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

velocities experienced by the moving particle is inversely proportional to the diameter. Consequently the required force is directly proportional to the diameter. Hence it is reasonable to conclude that the resisting force or drag upon the pipe (or bed of the canal) is directly proportional to the length of the pipe (or canal) and directly proportional to the diameter (or wetted perimeter); but the average resistance per unit of cross-sectional area is consequently in;versely proportio~1al to the diameter (or hydraulic mean depth). From what was shown in section 5 the resisting force is directly proportional to the square of the velocity (i. e., scale of the velocities). Since the direct effect of viscosity is assumed to be negligible, and since the fl.ow in the same body under different conditions is assumed to be geometrically similar, it follows that the diminution in velocity, or the loss of head, is independent of the pressure under which all motions take place. For, the differential pressure required to produce a certain scale of velocities is the same, whatever the general or atmospheric pressure, because it is consumed in the same way (i.e., to the same advantage) in accelerating the water particles. Experiments made with water pipes buried at various depths, ana Coulomb's experiments with an immersed pendulum disc-;- the apparatus being under the receiver of an air pump, all indicate that the general pressure has no effect upon the resistance. From what has just been said, this indicates th 1t the motions of the water particles are geometrically similar. It is here convenient to regard as a fundamental type of skin-frictional resistance that which occurs when a thin board of considerable length is placed lengthwise in a large, uniformly-fl.owing stream. Moreover, for a given fluid, only velocities falling within certain limits will be considered. · · It may be postulated as a law derived from observation that in some unknown manner a very thin fluid film clings to the solid with such tenacity that moving adjacent particles can not impart motion to it, and that this stationary film influences the motion of the fluid to considerable distances from the solid. This conception in part explains the fact that for most rigid and tolerably rigid surfaces the amount of resistance for like velocities and dimensions is approximately the same per square unit. But it increases Somewhat with the roughness of the boundary surface. The amount of this resistance (force) can be approximately represented by

This equation is of fundamental importance both for the flow of water through pipes and in open channels. In neither of the foregoing modes of establishing Bernoulli's theorem with friction added is it supposed that the velocity is alike from axis to boundary. It may vary accordi~g to any law. The velocity used in the formula may be the mean cross-sectional velocity, the axial velocity, or any other specified with reference to the cross section; for each case C' will have a different value. Unless otherwise indicated, the mean cross-sectional velocity is understood to be the one associated with C'. If the pipe or channel consist of several parts which have different cross-sectional areas, a resistance term can be added in the denominator of (50) for each length. Moreover, for each bend or sudden change of cross section, a resistance term, depending in a measure upon the slope and: size of the stream, will occur.
IO.

Nonuniform .flow impeded by skin-frictional resistance.

If the cross section changes slowly, and if we assume the fl.ow to be without fric-

tional resistance, the case comes. under Bernoulli's theorem without resistance terms. If resistance exists, a modification of the work just given will become necessary, because there the pipe or channel was assumed to have a uniform cross section for a considerable distance. This can be readily accomplished for a pipe of continually varying diameter. For it would only be necessary to divide the pipe into elements so short that the resistance for each could be easily ascertained, the relative velocities being known through the condition of continuity. If water flows in an open channel, it would_ still generally be possible to make an estimate of the velocities in a similar manner, provided we somewhere know the depth and velocity, and especially if we know the depth at two points a considerable distance apart and the velocity at one of them, or know the velocities at the two points and the depth at one of them.

If any filament of water in an open channel be considered, it is readily seen that the forces which drive along an elementary mass,· gravity directly and pressure (gravity indirectly), are the same as the force along the surface, directly above the element and which is direct gravity alone, viz., g cos <P per unit mass, where <P is the angle between the surface and the nadir. Consequently, in the motion of an element, the pressure at each end of the element may be regarded as one and the same; and so the pressure terms may be omitted from Bernoulli's theorem. The differential equation thus becomes

vdv= -gdz-C'2h-ds, and the same integrated between the limits s=s1 , s=s 2 , becomes

In computing this force, the velocity of a particle is supposed to be unaltered by the presence of the submerged object, although eventually it will be reduced in value, because after leaving the front surface of the object the particle moves obliquely to the general direction of the stream.

Comparatively recent determinations give to C values bet..yeen 1. 25 and I. 75_. It is generally assumed that the resistance or force of impact is the same whether the body moves through the water or the wat~r impinges upon the body held stationary. In case of a plate wholly submerged and held perpendicular to the lines of motion, it is evident that the greater resistance will occur.in the case where the plate is stationary. For, in this case, on account of the discontinuous motion and the inertia of the impinging water, a considerable amount of dead water will lie behind the plate; the stream lines will be prevented from so closing in behind as to somewhat resemble their appearance in front of the plate; that is, the impinging force due to the curvature of an elementary stream in front of the plate may not to any considerable extent be offset by a similar force in the rear. But if the plate moves through the water, the streams around its edges continually turn inward, thus preventing the occurrence of a void, and later give rise to a force urging the plate forward. Wherever discontinuous motion occurs,.it is not probable that theresistance determined by moving the body will be equivalent to that obtained by assuming it fixed and the water in motion.

Through orifices the amount of the theoretical discharge is diminished by a factor styled the coefficient of discharge. This is the product of the coefficient of velocity times the coefficient of contraction or vena contracta. For orifices, the coefficient of velocity is nearly equal to unity, especially for high velocities, and the coefficient of discharge about o.6. The value diminishes slightly as· the size of the orifice is incn~ased and shows that the motion is nearly but not exactly geometrically similar for. various velocity scales. As noted in section 20, Part IV A, the coefficient of contraction for a two-dimensional stream is n:/ (2+n:)=o.611. Bovey considers the coefficient of contraction to be approximately 0.64 for sharpe<lged orifices of any form and nearly unity for those perfectly rounded.* At the mouth of a projecting tube or mouthpiece the velocity is theoretically that due to height. Consequently if the mouthpiece be divergent the velocity at a narrow. section will exceed that due to height. This has been shown by Bernoulli, Venturi, Eytelwein, and Francis. The increased velocity will not be realized in vacuo, nor if an open channel take the place of the tube or mouthpiece. Hence the flow along an open short channel connecting two bodies of water can never from this cause exceed the velocity due to difference between the surface levels even at the most contracted part of the channel.

These results should apply fairly well to hypothetical terrestrial canals whose lengths are not greater than, say, 45 ° of a great circle, if all resistance could be left out of consideration. The value of the sustaining forces taken in the direction of the canal, can be ascertained from sections 1, 2, and Fig. 1, Part IV A, and as a rule only the value at the middle of the canal need be computed. When the force is variable over the length of the canal, a progressive wave will generally accompany the stationary wave unless the canal lies along a meridian.

If the canal have great depth, equation (107) shows that when the tidal body is on meridian, it is high water in latitudes below 45° and low water in higher latitudes. If the canal have ordinary oceanic depth, this rule is reversed. The general problem of finding the tides in canals, whether circular, closed at one end, or at both ends, friction being taken into account, has been treated hy Airy in subsection 6 of his Tides and Waves. Similar matters are treated by Ferrel in Chapter IV of his Tidal Researches, and by Levy in Chapter VIII of his treatise on tides. The prnblem of finding the tide in a canal of any length bounded at both ends and whose waters are acted upon by a force periodic in time and varying or not varying over the canal,. although a special case of the more general problem, is nevertheless one of considerable difficulty. For a solution, see Airy's Tides and Waves, article 337, and for numerical examples of east-and-west canals, see Ferrel's Tidal Researches, sections 144-149. On account of the difficulties connected with problems of the class just mentioned and the questionability of the results obtained being applicable to the existing oce.an tides, it seems best to here rest content with giving tl~e above references.

23. Concerning the ''ages'' and cotjjicients

ef tidal inequalities.

In case of a compound pendulum oscillating in a resisting medium, iHs easy to see that if the sustaining force is not exactly isochronous with its natural period, the departures in phase from the phase obtained upon the assumption of exact isochronism are proportional to the departure of speed from the critical speed. For, in equation (297), Part IV A, · C" a'A2 tau a · (108) i M(a2-a'2) 'f..2

Here a 1 denotes the phase of the sustaining. force (intensity) when the phase of the oscillation (displacement) is 180°, a' is the speed of the sustaining force, a that of the free pendulum. Suppose a'=a+E; then

Now since the difference between the phase of the force· and phase of the oscillation is about 90°, we may write tan a 1 = tan (90°+£) when E is a small angle. But tan (90°+E)==-i; or

(IIo)

E/ E= constant;
and so the departure of the phase of a pendulum from 90°, or its critical value, is proportional to the departure of the natural "speed" of the pendulum from the "speed" of the sustaining force. Equation (296), Part IV A,

shows that the amplitude of the oscillation varies but slowly on account of the variation in phase, provided a 1 lies near to ± 90°. Other things being equal, the amplitude of the oscillation is then very nearly proportional to the amplitude of the impressed force. The above expression may be written

showing that the defect in this proportionality is proportional to the square of small angle E or to the square E=a' -a. Suppose the amplitude of the vibration with resistance to be reduced thereby to µ' times the amplitude of the vibration without resistance.

T hen, a 1 =60°, or 120°; that is, the force phase relatively to that

of the displacement of the pendulum is within 30° of the value which it would assume were the length exactly critical and so resistance in absolute control. 24. Considering, first, only areas in which fairly large tides are produced; it will be seen that the values of S 2 /M 2 , N 2 .IM 2 , sg-M~, Mg-N~ (sec. 97, Part IV A; sec. 19, Part IV B) do not differ very greatly in going from place to place. Now, if the departure from the critical dimensions suited to the i:ieveral semidiurnal components were a matter of prime importance, we would find places where one or more of the ratios of the amplitudes would be widely different from the ratios of the amplitudes of the forces, and where it would be reasonable to suppose one or more of the epoch differences would be approximately 180° instead of zero degrees. For, if the free period of an ''area" were greater than the pariod of one of the components and less than the period of another component, the epochs of the tides with reference to the forces should differ by l 80 °. At any rate, this condition could be realized in comparing different areas. From the table in section 2 l it can be seen that in the case of no resistance, great variations in amplitude ratios should, in an area of nearly critical dimensions, result from slight variations in the speeds of the components. But, as already stated, such great variations do not occur in areas having fairly large tides. It follows that the resistance, including dissipation, must be paramount. As already noted, the amplitude of the forced oscillations of a pendulum in a period closely approximating its natural period is nearly proportional to the sustaining force. On the other hand,- the existence of positive ages for most areas having good tides indicates that the difference in speed of the semidiurnal components is felt to a limited extent. That is, the epochs of two components are not equal to each other, nor do they differ by 180°; but the epoch belonging to the faster component is generally a few degrees greater than the epoch belonging to the other, the amount in degrees, when two differences are compared, being roughly proportional to the speed differences.

This statement accords· with what has already been shown with reference to a pendulum sustained by forces whose periods are nearly equal to the free period of the pendulum. Now if the length (i. e., variation from the critical length) had no sensible effect upon the pha5e or epoch, it is doubtful if the phase would be altered in this manner by resistance. To convince one that ages, if due to only resistance and variation in force intensity, must be smaller than those commonly found in nature, suppose, if possible, that the tide owes its existence to 2n successive impulses ( n in either direction), each contributing equally to its formation. .The amplitude of the tide at any given time will then be proportional, not to the forces acting at that time, but to the average value of the forces during the n preceding periods, and so approximately proportional to the force

periods before the time of tide. But it is reasonable to suppose that the effect of the impulse nearest the time of tide is much greater than the effect of any one of the earlier impulses. Consequently the greatest tides must follow the greatest forces by a time or age not exceeding a small fraction of~ periods in length.
2

For the semidailytide it is prob-

able that n periods do not exceed three or four days. . We are thus led to believe that the small departures of the periods of the components from the free period of a body are necessary in order that the resistances may cause the ''ages'' of the inequalities; but that such departures, unless considerable, generally have but a moderate influence upon the amplitude ratios. If a component nearly fits an area, the phase of the tide will not be sufficiently altered to depart far from the phase determined upon the assumption of exact agreement between period of the component and free period of the body and where resistance controls. In some cases, even where the range of the ocean tide is not remarkably small, the ratios S 2 /M2 , N 2 IM2 may differ greatly from the theoretical values. Similarly the values of S~- M~, M~-N~ may in some instances be almost anything. These conditions may be brought about through the close correspondence in period between two or more modes of free oscillation and the components involved. This may occur because the outlines of the body are generally irregular and the dimensions not very definite. In fact, it is easy to imagine a rectangular area where the lines of motion in an oscillation suited to S 2 shall lie at right' angles to the lines of motion suited to M2 · Along the southern coasts of Australia and around Lower California the ratio S 2 i M2 is unusually large. In such localities ''dodging tides'' may occur in extreme cases. The ratio S 2 /M 2 may be considerably too small in a well-defined area and where but .one mode of oscillation could be expected, because the free period of the area differs , considerably from the period of S 2 · An example of this occurs along the Atlantic coast of the United States. The coast of New Zealand and the Pacific coai;t of southern Chile are probably examples of this, but on account of the expanse of the Pacific Ocean there is a possibility of the S 2 -oscillation differing in mode from the M2 -oscillation. Where the ocean tide is small the ratios S 2/M 2 ,N2/M 2 may depart from their theoretical values or values where the tide is large; and the values of S~- Mg, Mg- Ng may

273

be almost anything, because the nodal line of a stationary oscillation for M2 may not be the nodal line of a stationary oscillation for S 2 or N 2 · Near the nodal lines the above ratios would naturally vary, especially in a dependent fractional area. Examples of this are the tides at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal and near Portland, England. If the cause of the small ocean tides can not be seen, it is reasonable to suppose that different modes of oscillation for different components account for many of these apparent irregularities. It ma.y be that in many places of small tides the forced oscillations of bodies whose periods do not cJosely approach the semidaily period are of sufficient size to be comparable with the other tides there existing. But it is probable that the ratios in such oscillations if considered alone would approach the theoretical values and that the ages would be very short, thus approaching the conditions of equilibrium tides. In fact, there are doubtless basins in all oceans in which approximate equilibrium tides arise (particularly diurnal tides),, but these are generally obscured by the derived waves from other sources. Generally speaking, the bodies of water in which fairly large tides ar~ generated approach more nearly to M2 in the matter of free periods than to S 2 · Hence the theoretical hours laid down in Fig. 23, Part IV A, belong, as a rule, to the lunar rather than the solar tide. The dimensions of the '' areas'' generally indicate this, and the smallness of S 2/M 2 gives further confirmation. The values of N 2 /M 2 being generally greater than the force ratio or o. 1936 for the Atlantic and Pacific .coasts of the United States indicates, perhaps, that N~ is fitted by the ''areas'' better than is M2 · The large value of N 2 iM2 for Suez "is probably due to the fact that the Gulf of Suez approaches

nearer to a critical length (~A) for the Nrwave than for the M2-or Srwave. Owing 4 to the rapidity with which the tidal impulses are destroyed through dissipation and friction, and also to the possibility of somewhat different modes of oscillation for the various semidaily tidal constituen.ts, it is not reasonable to suppose that their amplitudes will be very nearly proportional to the forces, nor that their epochs will follow any simple law. 25. On the dissipation or want of motion. Observation shows that ocean tides generally are too great to be produced by a single impulse of the tidal forces (as in the case of equilibrium tides); it shows the existence of fairly well-defined nodal lines and loops, thus establishing beyond all doubt the existence of stationary waves in certain oceanic areas. Moreover, the computed free periods for such areas generally approximate to the periods of the tidal forces; i. e., the areas have approximately critical dimensions. Regarding this hypothesis as sufficiently well established, the questions now to be considered· relate to the resistances which check or reduce the motion and affect the phase of the oscillation relatively to that of the forces. In determining the time of elongation of the water particles, accordii1g to sections 62-67, Part IV A, it is assumed that the dimensions of the oscillating body are so nearly critical that the resistance is the important factor. It should have been noted earlier that equation (305), Part IV A, can be written in a more general form, thus adapting it to less restricted hypotheses. For example, the assumed mode of division of the body of water into elements might be quite different in the resistance term from the mode of division used in the other terms. That is, it is of no consequence how the

body is divided for resistance provided the resistance from all parts be finally added together. The resistance coefficient may be great in one locality and small in another; that is, C' should take a subscript ( r or K), and so, from what has been said, the last term of (305), Part IV A, may be written in the more general form

-Aa2'C' KmKsin 2 /xKsin at.
K

Evidently the rules laid down in the sections referred to for connecting the forces with the time of tide will not be altered by this-generalization, but it becomes important when one attempts to look more closely into the nature of the resistance; in fact, it is obvious that the distribution of the resisting causes may vary greatly in different cases. The term resistance will be used to denote the cause of all absence, diminution, or loss of motion, judged from what would have resulted under given sustaining forces had all boundaries been regular and complete and had the liquid been a perfect fluid. The part of the resistance due to imperfect and incomplete boundaries may be called either ''dissipation'' or ''virtual resistance;'' while the part due to motion in the area only, such as friction and viscosity, is real or actual resistance. For a body of water a little less than ; i\. long having a complete. regular boundary and being devoid ~f all resistance, the high water in either half. of the body occurs when the horizontal force is ·greatest in the direction of the half considered. The wave, however, is the result of several or many impulses of these forces, and so the one most nearly coinciding with the time of a particular hig-h water is responsible for only a small part of the motion. Each impulse acting in this way has very little power to sustain the oscillation. Now, if resistance occurs _the observed oscillation is the result of forces acting in a manner best suited to sustain it; for if not, some other arrangement would arise which would cause a greater amplitude to the motion. It is obvious that. in order to overcome friction the sustaining forces must act more with the moving particles·than against them.
If the area is very nearly ~i\. in length and the amplitude is kept down by friction
. 2

proportional to the velocity, it is easily seen that the forces must be of the same phase as the velocities, in order to sustain the greatest actual oscillation; in other words, the phase of the displacements must be ~r or 90° behind the phase of the forces.

.

4

Dissipation because of incomplete boundaries generally takes place through either stationary or progressive wave motion. Imagine a rectangular body or area of approximately critical dimensions to have solid barriers at the ends only. Experiment shows that the oscillation in such a body has a much smaller amplitude than would have been the case had all boundaries been solid; also that across the imaginary sides, particularly near the loops, a transverse stationary motion simultaneous with tlie longitudinal motion is going on. The reason for this transverse motion is obvious. For, an elevation at one loop causes an outward slope and so an outward acceleration. This gives a maximum outward velocity when the water at the loop has fallen to mean-water level. Similarly the greatest velocity toward this loop will occur at the time of mean level when the water is there risii1g.

APPENDIX 6.

CURRENTS, SHALLOW-WATER TIDES, ETC.

275

The outgoing water crowds up the water situated well outside of the area and so tends to cause it there to rise. If a rigid barrier were placed at a suitable distance beyond this free or imaginary side of the area, a considerable rise would actually take place. As no such barrier exists, the outward-going motion, well outside of the area, is not converted into height; it is communicated to waters not susceptible of taking up good oscillations. Consequently the succeeding inward motion does not have the benefit of any considerable height energy in the outer part of the transversely moving water. . The same result as to the loss of transverse motion will be obtained by considering in the first place a low water at the loop. The lateral boundaries of the main area being only imaginary, it is clear that every increment of energy given to the area by the forces is offset by a loss of motion going on across the missing or imaginary boundaries. The shorter the solid ends in comparison with the missing sides, the smaller will be the oscillation set up and maintained.
In fact the length of the end walls must be at least about!A. in length if

any considerable oscillation is to occur (see sec. 53, Part IV A). It will be noticed that energy is leaving the system most rapidly at the time of mean level rising or falling, and that none es~apes at the times of high and low water; at intermediate times the escape is proportional to the velocity which could have, under· other conditions, been converted into height. Therefore, whether much motion exists or not, it follows that the amplitude of the oscillation is kept down by destructive agencies most active at the times of mean level and which can be approximately represented by the term ( 11 7) which includes frictional resistance and is based upon the assumption that all resistance varies with the first power of the velocity. The dissipation term implied in the equation of ·virtual work [(302), Part IV A] may be

The corresponding term implied in (305), Part IV A, is

l x. sin at, and so may be considered as being covered by the

given resistance term, ( r r 7). . If an area were entirely surrounded by solid walls, excepting· one narrow opening into a tideless sea, the above law of dissipation, so far as dissipation occurs, holds here because according to sections 35, 103, Part IV A, the motion in the strait is a stationary oscillation simultaneous with the motion in the oscillating area sustaining it. If one of the four walls surrounding an area consists of a shore line made somewhat irregular by headlands and bays, then, provided the bays are nonpropagative arms of water, it is obvious that the motion in these is greatest at the time of mean level outside. Hence whatever resistance occurs in ,these arms, whether from friction proper or from the fact that the motion in them sustained by the rise and fall of the area is in part dissipated in the area, must follow the above law, at least very approximately. In the next. place, i.magine one of the four rigid walls surrounding an area to contain an opening through which a wave is propagated; for example, the mouth of a tidal river or other propagative arm of the ocean. The mass of water occupying the immediate approaches to the mouth of the river or bay rises and falls with the area upon which it depends. From the rise and fall of this mass, the energy expended in the river or bay is immediately derived. The size of this intermediary mass as compared with that of the oscillating system indicates, in a

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

measure, how much the motion in the latter will be reduced. At the time of mean level, energy is being transferred from the system proper to the intermediary mass at a maximum rate; at the time of high or low water none is being thus transferred. The question here simply relates to the transference of energy from the main body to the intermediary mass and has little to do with what goes on between this mass and the river proper. The resista~ce in the river tends to diminish the rise and fall at its mouth, hence the necessity of supplying energy to the mass in maintaining the rise and fall at the river's mouth. If one of the end boundaries of an oscillating area contain an opening of considerable size and through which a progression occurs, a progressive character is given to the tides of the area a considerable distance from the opening (antecedent wave). This progressive wave may result from two causes: ( 1) that just given, viz., the necessity of agreement in height between the water's surface off the mouth of the river or strait and that of the principal oscillation; ( 2) the fact that particles in and near the opening are not turned back at the time of elongation of principal oscillation, but somewhat later. In either case it is necessary to go into the area some distance from the opening in order to observe the true time of rise and fall for the principal oscillation. In either case, also, there must be an intermediary mass of water whereby energy is transferred from the principal oscillation to the progressive wave. In deep water this wave may be felt nearly across the area, and is often sustained in part by the horizontal motion across the nodal line. In the case of a stationary-dissipation movement, the greatest crowding of the waters into which the motion is dissipated takes place on the falling tide of the neighboring loop. In case of a progressive-dissipation movement, the greatest crowding of the waters immediately adjacent to the area takes place on the rising tide of the neighboring loop. More generally, the oseillation in an area having incomplete boundaries is kept down because the impulses of the tidal forces in their efforts to sustain or augment the oscillation tend to cause a crowding together or drawing asunder of the water particles near by. If the boundary were complete, an increased oscillation would result. Being incomplete, only a moderate rise and fall results. The failure to make the crowding effective in increasing the height at a loop of the area is most rapid at the time of halftide level. This is also the time when the height of the surface is changing most rapidly. Incomplete boundaries are in fact the chief reason why the tide in a given area always falls much short of its theoretical dynamical value. Whether the reduction of motion be due to irregularities in the shore line or to incompleteness of boundary, the forces will select a critical ·strip of water, if such exist; but on account of these defects of boundary the forces will act to comparatively poor advantage, especially in the case of the terrestrial oceans. It must not be inferred that energy is always expended most rapidly on account of a break in a boundary of the oscillating area or system at the time of half-tide level. Where hydraulic effects occur it may be otherwise. If the principal resistance of the area were of this character, the forces would not precede the displacements by ~r,
4

or 90°, as usual; for example, a lake or bay communicating with the sea through a

277

narrow and short strait. In this case the energy of the oscillation is being most rapidly reduced at about the time of high or low water outside, for then the surfaces of near-by waters have their greatest difference in height. It does not seem probable that dissipations of this kind are great enough to have a sensible influence upon ocean tides. And even in the case just supposed, as the opening becomes larger there will be less tendency to depart from the general rule. In section 23 it is shown that if the amplitude of vibration of a pendulum in a resisting medium be µ' times the value when free from resistance, the impressed forces remaining. the same in both cases, then the phase of the forces relatively to that of the displacement of the pendulum is given by the equation cos l.1'1=±µ'. Now, assuming that a tidal oscillation follows this law for all forms of resistance, as is probably very nearly the case, it follows that if the observed amplitude has -~ 4 of its theoretical value with no resistance, then the phase of maximum velocity of the particles differs from the phase of maximum forces by 14 ° 29', or about half an hour for a semidaily tide. · The nearer to critical dimensions are the dimensions of the oscillating areas, the greater will be their tides and the more will these tides overshadow all other tides which may arise from less suitable areas, and the more will the resultant tides be controlled by them; hen°ce .their great liability to chiefly constitute the observed tide. This state of affairs is, in fact, necessary wherever much incompleteness and irregularity of boundary exist; that is, µ' must be small on account of these defects in boundary and the dimensions of an area must be nearly critical in order that a sensible tide may arise in an area thus imperfectly surrounded. 26.

But the density of the earth increas~s from the surface toward the center according to some law not fully known. Among the hypotheses which have been used in questions connected with the earth's figure are Legendre's (or Laplace's), Roche's, Lipschitz-'s, Maurice Levy's, and Wiechert's. Without going into the computation in accordance with any of these hypotheses, we may use the value 504 X 1028 foot poundals given in the Smithsonian Tables, and which depends directly upon Harkness' values of the principal moments of inertia.

His approximate solution of this equation enabled him to partially explain the change in form of a wave where the depth is but a moderate multiple of the amplitude of the tide.* In 1871 M. de Saint-Venant gave as the rate of advance of a free wave 3-Jgz-2,Jgll where z denotes the depth and It the undisturbed depth. t In 1892 J. McCowan published an important paper entitled ''On the theory of long waves and its application to the tidal phenomena of rivers and estuaries.'' t Prof. Maurice Levy gives a very complete 'discussion of river tides in Chapter IX of his Theorie des Marees. § The aim of the present chapter is to give some of the more essential parts of Airy's, McCowan's, and Levy's developments, together with some modifications and additional matters.

This would seem to indicate that the mean of all ordinates of the tide curve at any given point of a river or canal lies a li}tle above the level of the ocean or of a tideless canal.* This conclusion is wrong, because, from the nature of the case, the mean level of the river near the mouth can not be sensibly raised above mean sea level just outside. At the mouth of the river where x=o the tide is assumed to be simply harmonic and so _the terms in 2at-2lx and whose coefficients do n?t contah~ x must vanish for all values of x; also the mean half-tide level must be that of the sea.

The fact that ' contains only simple cosine or sine terms shows that its mean value must be zero. The velocity can not follow exactly a similar simple law. For, at the time of flood the depth is greater than it is at the time of ebb, and so, in order that the same amount of water shall cross a given cross section on the ebb as on the .flood, the ebb current must average the stronger. In order to represent the decrease in the velocity on the flood, and the increase on the ebb, with neither increase nor decrease at the time of mean river level, it is natural to add a term proportional to the· square of the velocity and finally determine P. Take a section so near to the mouth of the river that the term having .i in its coefficient may be neglected. Then

Assuming the depth to be constant, the above equatfon shows how A', A'11 , b, and b1" are related. Hence, if the amplitudes of the tide at two cross sections and one of the widths of the channel be given or one amplitude and two of the widths, the remaining width or amplitude can be approximately inferred.

it follows that the average velocity of the tidal stream is the same for

all cross sections. This assumption seems to be reasonable or even fundamental in the formation of estuaries; for, if at any point the velocity were unusually great, the banks would there be more eroded than elsewhere by tidal action, and so the width would there increase and the velocity be reduced in the same ratio. At any rate, for purposes of commerce, the velocity and depth should be made as uniform as possible. Wheeler, on page 183 of his treatise on tidal rivers, gives an empirical formula for the breadth of a tidal river at different parts of its course. He applies ·his formula to the Humber River, the width being known at each end, i. e., at Spurn Point and Goole. His results are quoted here, and to them are added the values obtained by equation (236) using the same assumed data. River Humber .

In this computation K was determined from the known or assumed end widths and the distance between these two sections.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1907.

.Theoretically, only one width is necessary for the determination of all others. In case of the Humber River, the low-water width at the mouth is 18 0oo feet; required the width at a distance of 45 statute miles up the river. The average value of A' is 7 feet; the depth h, about 35 feet; and ''may be taken as 0.007. ·These make K o.ooo 002 43. The required width is, according to computation, 316 feet, which is about one-third of the measured value. Of course only a very rough agreement between theory and fact could be expected in such cases-hardly more than a~ agreement in order of magnitude. Suppose the width of the stream to be constant. The equation (233) becomes

+constant,

where constant= I! A This shows that the relation between the amplitude of the tide and the distance x can be represented by a hyperbola. . ..For a short distance, x 11 -x, the above integral becomes

( 2 39)

Starting with A' at the mouth of the river, the value of A 111 can be computed by this formula for a section a few miles higher up the river; starting with this value of the amplitude· of the tide, and proceeding as before, the value for a section still higher up can be found; and so on. 34. Harmonic constants.for shallow water components, and related quantities. The following table contains the constants for the principal shallow-water tides. The second set of values of S,, MS, St and MS 0 are inferred in accordance with section 48, Part II, and are given for the purpose of testing this mode of inference. The highwater and low-water intervals have been computed from M 2 and its harmonics in accordance with Part III. The tidal or cotidal hour is not the time of the M 2 tide alone, but is the hour obtained by using the high-water interval. It should, for each place given, agree with the tidal hour taken from a chart of cotidal lines (Part IV B).

35. Stations whose M, is due clziejly to propagation in shallow waters. The shallow waters are usually tidal rivers. The surmise that M, is due to propagation is confirmed by the fact that at places along their shores 2 M~- M~ == 90°. At the following places this difference from 90° does not exceed 30° and is generally much less: (32) Quebec, (40) Halifax, (44) Eastport, (66) Willets Point, (77) Philadelphia, (90) Washington, (98) Wilmington, (256) Pete Dahl Slough, (280) St. Michael, (425) Tientsin Entrance, (430) Shanghai, Wusung Bar, (438) Whampoa, (593) MoeraDjawa, Borneo, (635) Tacloban, (687) Melbourne (Williamstown), (689) Port Adelaide, (720) Amherst, Moulmien River, (725) Elephant Point, Rangoon River, (726) Rangoon, (740) Chittagong, (745) Dublat, Hoogly River, (746) Diamond Harbor, Hoogly River, (747) Calcutta (Kidderpore), (765) Negapatam, (802) Bhavnagar, (807) Porbandar, (825) Bushire, (850) Perim, (880) Betsy Cove, Kerguelen Island, (926) Marseilles, (946) Brest, (948) St. Malo, (950) Cherbourg, (956) West Hartlepool, (953) Hull, (96o) London Bridge, (962) Ramsgate, (964) Dover, (968) Pembroke, (970) Helbre Island, ·Mersey River, (971) Liverpool, (984) Ymuicien, (984.8) Haaks Light Ship, (985.5) Terschellingerbank Light Ship. In a few of these cases, the M, may be of a less obvious origin, and where it is ver:y small the value of M~ given in the table may be urlreliable. 36. Stations wlwse M, is due chiefly to a stationary wave. By section 29 the values of M~ and M2 should in a short canal closed at one end approximately satisfy the relation 2 Mg- M~ = 180°. At the following places this relation is always satisfied to within 30° and generally much less. In many cases the stationary wave is the shallow marginal strip of the sea. (101) Charleston, (105) Fernandina, (210) Panama, (251.5) Hooniah, (252.5) Granite ·Cove, (262) Valdez Arm, (271) Kaskega Bay, (440) Hongkong, (642) Santa Cruz, (643) Bolinao, (644) Sual, (660) Honolulu, (755) Vizagapatam, (845) Suez, (908) Duala (Kamerun), ('942) Boyard, (943) Rochelle, (944) St. Nazaire, (986) Wilhelmshaven. It will be seen from the table that, as might be expected, inany stations are intermediate between these two cases: e.g., New York and Savannah; Hanstal Point, at the head of the Culf of Kutch. ' 37. Stations whose M, is due to a truncated low water.
If the low waters are to be flattened while the high waters are undisturbed, it is evident that Mg and M2 should approximately satisfy the relation 2 Mg- M~=o. The occurrence of truncated low waters must be rare. Kokinhenic Island, Copper River Delta, (latitude 6o 0 18'.1N., longitude 145° 03'W.), is situated among extensive flats. At low water there is apparently little or no connection with the outside waters, for tides were there observed night and day during a period of two weeks (June 27 to July 11, 1898), by H. P. Ritter's hydrographic party, and the great~st variation in the height of low water during t.1is time was less than o.8 foot, notwithstanding the large low-water inequality along the outer coast (Fig. 2). See tables of harmonic constants given under section 19, Part IV B, and section 34, Part V. The truncated low waters should cause a large M,, whose epoch expressed in time should approxi-. mately agree with that of M 2 · Under No. 255, section 34, it is seen that 2 M~-M~= 11°, and thatM,/M 2 =0.284.

38. Stations where M, is due to displacement of level due to currents rounding a point.

From section 12, Part JV A, it appears that if a current rounds a cape and so causes . the particles to describe arcs of concentric circles with equal angular velocities as· seen from the common center, the amount of transverse tilting resulting therefrom will vary as the square of the velocity of the stream. Hence the outer threads of a stream harmonic in time will produce a sharpened elevation at the time of the maximum velocity; and at the same time the inner threads will produce a similar depression. . ·. M, has its maximum or minimum at the time when the stream is swiftest. If the time of

high water agree with the time of greatest flood velocity, then at the outer side of the curved stream 2 M~-M~=o and at the inner side 2 Mg-M~=180°. Off Victoria, Vancouver Island, the greatest maximum flood velocity occurs near the time of high water; being on the inn!r edge of the stream, 2 Mg-M~ should lie near 180°. Observation makes this out to be i 81 °.
39. Stations where the duration of rise exceeds the duration offall.

For tides of this character the relation 2 M~-M~=270° should be approximately satisfied. The M, in such cases seems generally to be due, in some way not easily explained, to the fact that the station is situated either upon a strait or at or near the

If the length of the arm of water upon which a station is situated approach .7.(A., where A. denotes the length of the M,-wave, and if the water lying outside of this arm be shallow for some distance, then the M, will be unusually large at the station. According to section 34, Part IV A, one would expec;t that the phase of the M, tide in the arm of water should, in the critical case, be one-fourth of a period behind that of

t.he M, tide outside. This, however, necessitates that shoal water exist at the outer end of the arm of water, in order that an inward progression shall arise. If everything is practically stationary immediately outside, then the arm will be in the same or in the opposite phase to the outside water according as its length is less or greater than ,>iA.. Consider Newport, Bristol, and Providence, upon Narragansett Bay. By the table M,=0.18, 0.29, 0.34 foot. M~=120°, 134°, 150°, and 2 M~-M~=315°, 310°, 307°, respectively. , If a. body of water symmetrical to Narragansett Bay were located to the south and joined the latter along an east-and-west line across the mouth, the period of free oscillation of the body composed of these two would, on account of the narrowness of the connecting passes, be very nearly 6 hours. But, as there is. little progression in the locality of the mouth of the bay, the stationary wave will extend some distance seaward, and so be somewhat more than 3'A. long. The phase of the M, oscillation in the bay will therefore be 180° different from its phase outside. Also, 2M~-M~ should, because of the stationary character of the M2 wave, be approximately 180° different in the bay from the corresponding value outside. Observations at Newport give 2 Mg-M~=315°, and so the inferred outside value is 315°-180°=135°. This value seems reasonable, as it lies between the value for a progressive and stationary wave; and such is the character of the tide between Narragansett Bay and deep ocean water. Because of the critical length of the bay, a small M, outside will cause a large M, at Providence. The values of 2 M~-M~ in the bay indicates that the duration of rise must exceeu that of fall; also, that there is a tendency to a double low water, which becomes conspicuous at Providence. (See Fig. 3.) At Portland Breakwater, England, the value of 2MB-M~ is 356°, a value very favorable for double low waters. The cause of this peculiarity is not easily ascertained.*

4r. Stations wkere an apparent Me arises from want of free communication betwet' tke ftoat box and outside water; or a real Me in a nearly inclosed /1arbor.
As noted in section 9, Part IV A, an imperfect fl.ow into and out of the float box will give rise to an M0 whose epoch is connected with that of MM by the relation 3 M~-Mg=o. Upon looking over the table it will be seen that at few if any stations is there a large M0 whose epoch is such that the above relation is satisfied. Consequently it seems fair to conclude that the observations upon which these values are basec\ were so carried on as to be practically free from such errors as would result from too restricted openings through the walls of the float box. No analyses giving M0 are available for harbors having very narrow openings. Probably this sharpenipg of the highand low waters on the marigram at Melbourne, Port Phillip, could be shown to exist if the M-sums were analyzed for M 6 · It will be noticed that those places given in the table where this. relation is approximately satisfied, are in many instances land-locked harbors.. It seems probable that this topographic feature explains the M 0 at such places.

42. Stations wlzere M8 is due to the 11,ydraulic effect £n a stra£t connecting two tidal bodies. According to Section 37, Part I, the current curve for the strait has its maxima and minima flattened and so the duration of slack lessened, i.e., 3Mg-Mg=180°. While it is ~ssume'd that the tides some distance from either end of the strait are not affected by the current and tide in the strait, a like assumption does not apply to the waters just off its ends. Suppose the case of a short strait having a large stationary tide wave off one end. At about the time of its low water the current of the strait will be at its strength in that direction. This velocity will be greatly diminished upon leaving the strait because of the sudden eiilargement of cross section of the stream. Whatever tide is thus made will occur at about the time of the slackening of the stream in this direction. This corresponds to the case of a small opening into a fl.oat box, Fig. 7, Part IV A (see also case just described). Hence the considerable sharpening of the M8 tidecurvewhere the strait joins the larger body . . ·. 3M~-Mg=o where M 2 denotes the tide due to the strait. Also, Mg=M~+ 90° where Mg refers to the current going toward the stationary wave. · ·. Mg=3 (M~+go 0 )=3M~-90°. East River joins Long Island Sound at Willets Point. The western end of the sound is largely surrounded by land, and so is influenced by the Hell Gate tide. Moreover, it is approximately low water in the western end of the sound at the time of maximum eastward velocity in East River. From Fig. 11 it is readily seen that for the eastern portion of East River M:g= 6 X 30° = 180°. The relation Mg= 3 M:g-90° gives Mg=90°. From observations made at Willets Point Mg=84 °. Here 3 Mg-Mg= 182°; hence the tendency to double high water and to double low water. (See Fig. 9, Pt. I.) 43. References to discussions ef tides not simpl.J' ltarmonic: . E.

The time is referred to the time of maximum positive velocity of the stationary wave if c'=o, and of the pr<;>gressive wave at x=o, if e"=o.

48. Currents £n a marginal stn.p of shallow water.

Given the rise and fall of tide and the varying depth of the water from the shore outward, required the current velocities at various distances from the shore upon the assumption that the tide in the region considered is a dependent stationary wave of sensibly constant range. Let x be reckoned outward from the shore line and t from the time of high water. Let A' denote the ~plitude of the tide and a its speed. Let k=f(x) be the depth at mean-tide stage. Then the tidal volume, one unit broad and extending outward from the shore line a distance x is Ax cos at. The cross section at x of unit width has for its area f(x)+A cos at. · Assuming the flow to take place in vertical slices, the velocity at any given time of tide is I i'J(Ax cos at) u=-f(x)+A cos at --3,---, Aax sin at <' = .f(x)+A cos al This is not strictly harmonic. The last half of the flood and first half of the ebb will appear, upon a plotting of the current, more nearly like a straight line than would have been the case for simple harmonic motion, while the last half of the ebb and first half of the flood will have more curvature because of this irregularity. Ignoring the effect of the rise and fall upon the cross section, u=

which is simply harmonic. For M 2 , a=m 9 =o.ooo 140 s radian per second. If ./( x) = µx+ H, H being the depth at the shore and µ the downward slope of the bottom, then Aax sin at u= µx+H ; and ifH=o,

Hence, the off or on shore velocity for a uniformly sloping bottom, the depth of water being zero at the shore, is independent of the distance from the shore. If µ=o, sin at ; u= Aax ____H ___ that is, the off or on shore velocity for a shallow strip of water of uniform depth is directly proportional to the distance from the shore. The cases found in nature often lie between the two just considered. It is important to observe that for a uniformly sloping bottom the refluent under currents due to winds diminish from the shore in going outward. Let -r' denote the time of high water of the stationary wave at x=o and -r" that of the progressive wave at x=o. Then the velocity due to a stationary wave nom1al to the shore line may be written - - sin (at-a-r') µ .where A' is amplitude of the stationary portion of the tide._ The velocity for the pro_gressive wave near the origin and along its line of advance is, equation (38), Part I,

Progressions result from such irregularities in the shore line as estuaries and narrow openings into bays, also from certain irregularities in the bottom, although the rise and fall of the outside waters is, of course, the cause of all such motion. The time of tide on the general shore line depends little upon the existence or absence of estuaries and straits leading inland. Hence, the time of high water in the entrance to such estuaries or straits can not differ much from the time of tide for the same shore line devoid of such irregularities. The difference generally becomes. greater as the size of the estuary or other shallow arm of the :;ea increases; but it seldom exceeds one hour and is generally much less. Because of the existence of an antecedent wave (sec. 8, Part IV B), one can assume that somewhere not far off the mouth of the estuary or

strait, the time of tide is the same as it would have been had no such opening been present. For this point the time of turning of the current will approximately satisfy (266); and conversely if the time of turning is known, the ratio A"/ A' can be estimated. In fact, I! is often in the neighborhood of 15, and, for· the shelving areas here cona . sidered,

.Ji

generally ranges from one-fourth to unity or more.

Since the obseryed

delay of turning outside the estuary seldom exceeds one hour, it follows that A" is there a small fraction of A'. As the estuary is approached and entered, the T" terms in (264) become dominant and t approaches the values T"±3h. On the other hand, equation (265) shows that when It becomes sufficiently great, t=T' or T'+6h, as was to be expected.

(267)

which gives the time of maximum or minimum current at any point x, y after the time of the maximum current in the stationary wave; A' and A" are supposed to be functions of x, y, suited to the problem in hand. There exists a point at which the component velocities are equal i.n amplitude and differ in phase by an odd multiple of 90°. For, the point x, y will cause the numerator of (267) to vanish if l'y+e'.'=o or (2v+1)~.
2

This second value of y substituted in

the denominator will cause it also to vanish, and so the time of maximum current to become indeterminate, if A' =A". The value of x thus determined is the remaining coordinate of the point in question and which, as already noted, may be styled a '' circular point.'' · In particular, suppose A'= constant and suppose A" to be some such function of

x as A' e -p~x or Lix A'.

Taking the circular point as the space-origin it is evident

that all along the line x=o, the component velocities are equal. Since for simplicity e' has been taken as zero, e"ia denotes the excess of the current hour of the progressive wave at this point over that of the stationary wave. The velocity ellipse at any part x, y, will have its y-semiaxis numbered /" J'+e" in excess of the numbering of the x-semiaxis. The latter number is the current hour of the stationary wave multiplied by a.

The velocity ellipse may be denoted either by the single equation (273) or by the two equations (270), (271), provided A', A", e', E", in the latter refer to principal axes.

By means of the parallelogram of velocities it is easily seen that the time of maximum tidal current is the time of maximum resultant current (someti.mes of minimum current, if the resultant direction is more than 90° away from the tidal current considered). Hence, the observed time of maximum resultant current is the time of maximum tidal curr:!nt.

Where the tidal currents are not rectilinear, but elliptical, the heads of the radiating arrows representing the observed velocities (at each hour, say) will lie upon the perimeter of an ellipse. The major semiaxis found from the plotting represents in magnitude and direction (but not in position) the maximum tidal velocity, and the minor semiaxis, the minimum. The permanent current is represented by a line drawn from the origin of the plotting to the center of the ellipse.

the stationary portion becomes dominant as x increases in value, while the progressive portion becomes dominant as x increases numerically in the negative direction.

If A'= C, i. e., if p=o, also if D= C; then the line of equal component velocities (i. e., where u = v) is not the y-axis, but is a curve tangent to the y-axis at the origin, and the distribution or radiation is the same as that shown in the figure. Circular points may frequently be regarded as resulting from the crossing of two tidal streams, the phase of one being nearly constant in respect to distance, the phase of the other varying rapidly (i. e., l" is much greater than l, which depends directly upon the depth); the former may be spoken of as a stationary stream and the latter as a progressive stream. The velocity amplitudes in either or both may vary according to any regular law. At a circular point the component-velocity amplitudes must be equal and lie perpendicularly to each other, also the phases in these two directions must differ by 90° or three hours. If two such streams intersect (not necessarily at right angles) there will generally be a line along which the two component-velocity amplitudes in these directions are

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

equal to each other. For, the ratio "of these two amplitudes may be supposed to vary in the region covered by the streams according to some law, and in particular; near any point at which they happen to be equal. Along a certain line drawn through this point the amplitude ratio will vary most rapidly, and along some one line it will not vary at all from unity. Lay off from any point two arrows, each equal to the amplitude of either component velocity, their direction being the directions of the two streams. But the simply harmonic motions (displacements or velocities) along two fotersecting paths, give as the resultant path or hoclograph, an ellipse, whose center is this point and whose major or minor axis bisects the angle between the two paths. By varying the phase of one motion relatively to the phase of the other, all forms of ellipses will be obtained and all of these will be inscribed in a rhombus, the centers of two of whose sides are the outward extremities.of the given paths. One of these ellipses must be a circle. Note the relative phase corresponding to the circle. If it is ±go 0 , the point is a circular point. If not, go along the line of equal amplitudes until the relative phase for the circular paths is ±go 0 · 56. To find Ike time and amount ef Ike greatest height difference for a strait connecting two tidal bodies. Let O~at and suppose the time origin to be the time of high water at the end characterized by the single subscript. Then z 1 -z11 or A, cos 0-A 11 cos (0-e) is to be a maximum or minimum.

fl= 180°-E or E= 180°-fl. § 4, Part Iii.

Now Table 15 gives the angle v', and the "HW phase" is the angle fl. Hence if we take the argument fl from 180° the tabular value of the table will, when reduced to hours, be the time whereby the time of the A,-tide must be diminished in order to give the time when the A,-height most exceeds the A 11-height. If the time is reckoned from the time of the A 11-high water instead of to the time of the A,-tide, the A 11-height will most exceed the A,-height at. times given by entering Table l 5 with E= fl- l 80°, using the '' HW phase'' or fl written at the bottom of the table. In this way _Table 60, showing the time of maximum slope, has been constructed. Either of these values of E substituted in A, cos O-A 11 cos (0-{3) gives A, cos 0 +A 11 cos (fJ+ fl) which is of the same form as the height due to two simple tide waves, equations (1g), Part III. Hence if the columns of Table 16 be taken in the inverse : order these results follow immediately. Table 6 r shows the difference in surface elevation for the two ends of the strait. In accordance with sections 35, 102, Part IV A, the time of strength of flood or ebb in a strait of length L connecting two tidal bodies is given by the equation

CHAPTER V.
OBSERVATION AND REDUCTION OF TIDAL CURRENTS.

57. Observations of the directions and velocities of currents are usually attended with considerable difficulty and expense; for, the work being carried on in boats, is liable to interruptions caused by unfavorable weather and in many instances by the passing of boats. The installation and maintenance of a fixed self-registering current meter is probably out of the question; and so the amount of observation must depend upon the time during which the observers are on duty. In whatever manner current observations are to be made, great care should be taken to ascertain and to give in the record the location of each station, not only by angles between three or more objects marked upon charts and hydrographic sheets, but also upon a tracing, sketch, or fragment of a chart, which should always accompany the record. Generally the position upon both flood and ebb should be shown. The work of the field party is not coµiplete until the directions, azimuths, or bearings of all objects sighted upon in connection with the observations and all directions of the observed currents have been ascertained and given in the record. For locating stations, objects not too far away should be sighted upon, and these may be quite numerous; but for determining the direction of the current it is advantageous to use objects rather remote and few in number. If at some distance from land, positions should be given by latitude and longitude with as much precision as the means at hand will permit. In all cases soundings should be frequently made, as this aids in identifying the station and in judging of the probable nature of the current. The record should be given in such a form as to show readily directions and velocities of the current, the depths at which the observations have been taken, the variation and deviation of the compass. The kind of time used should always be specified, and care should be taken to write ''a. m.'' or '' p. m. '' at the top of each page and at the beginning of each half day. The purpose of the survey will govern the distribution of stations and the length of time during which they are to be occupied. Owing to irregularities produced by the wind and the discharge of fresh water, each station should be occupied for several days, if possible. For such stations as may be chosen as principal stations in a hydrographic survey, the time of occupation should be 15 or 30 days. For determining the nontidal currents, the same stations.should be occupied at different seasons· of the year.

58. Floats.
Current observations are usually ·made either by means of floats, or by means of meters having revolving vanes or cups. The float or log is usually a cylindrical body 2, 3, or more inches in diameter and from 1 to 4 fathoms in length. If hollow, the amount of weight necessary to cause it to float vertically, and to project a small distance above the water is easily applied. In case the float is a solid log, then the loading is accomplished by pouring lead into a hollow extending upward from the bottom, or by tacking sheet lead around the outside.

If double floats are used for obtaining the velocity below the surface, the lower one should be large in comparison with the surface or upper one. The lower float (if itmay be so called) may consist of a sphere, cylinder, or two intersecting plane sheets of galvanized iron. In the last instance it is desirable to have air cavities at the upper edges of the intersecting vanes, and to attach leaden weights to the lower edges. In this way the proper tension upon the connecting cord or wire can be secured and the vanes will keep a vertical position. The upper float may be either cylindrical or spherical. Let the observed common velocity of the two floats be denoted by vc, the observed surface velocity by V8 , then the velocity of the lower body ~ v1) will be

~-

vc(R.j-RJ)__~v~.

(292)

R,

where R 8 and R 1 denote resistances of impact upon the two bodies found by placing them successively in the same stream or drawing them through still water with the same velocities. The only assumptions implied in this formula are that the ratio of the force of resistance of the two bodies remains the same for all velocities (see secs. 12-14) and that the wire or cord connecting the two bodies is small. The line, when thoroughly wet, should be divided by means of leather straps, smtably marked by perforated boles into divisions each 50. 67 feet in length, representing knots. Each of these spaces should be subdivided by knotted cords into spaces 5.07 feet in length. If the interval used is 30 seconds, the number of large divisions run off will represent the velocity in knots per hour and the numbered smaller divisions the decimals of knots. If a nm of 28 seconds be used, the principal divisions should be 47.29 feet in length. There should be at least 60 feet of stray line between the float and the zero division, in order that the float may drift beyond the influence of the vessel before the measurements commence. The length of the line should be frequently tested. If a watch instead of a glass be used as the timepiece, the graduations of the line may be omitted. In using such a line the number of seconds consumed in paying out a given length is ascertained, preferably by aid of a stop watch. If 100 feet is the length of line so run off, the velocity in feet per second will be -- ~-, where t denotes the number of seconds consumed. But (feet per second) X ;~= knots per hour, and so for 100 feet of line v=45100 = 59.21 knots 76 t t for a line

That is,. by taking a line of suitable leugth the velocity becomes the reciprocal of t multiplied by a simple number like 100 or 50.

59. Observations by means

effloats.

.

There are numerous ways of observing ~urrents by means of floats, some of which consist in ( r) noting the number of knots or marks upon a log line which are paid out in 30 seconds of time; (2) noting the time required for a given length of line to be paid out; (3) following up a free float with a boat and fixing the positions from time to time by angles upon three or more objects; (4) measuring angles between the float and fixed objects.by means of two theodolites located upon the shore, or watching the fl.oat pass two parallel ranges a kno~ distance apart; (5) ascertaining the amount by which a vessel has been displaced through the action of a current. As a rule observations upon free floats are objectionable because of the great labor connected with their reduction, and because they do not refer to a single point or station. In making observatibns with a line and float (first method) one man· holds the reel while another notes the time. When the log is cast, and the stray line is out so that the initial mark has appeared and has reached the fixed reference point on or near the reel, the person holding the reel cries "now;" the· person with the watch notes the p0sition of the second-hand, and when thirty seconds have elapsed, cries ''stop." The person at the reel now notices what division of the line ha5 reached the reference point. This is recorded, and if the length of the line be sufficient, it may be allowed to run out for another thirty seconds after any particular division or marking of the line has reached the reference point on or near the reel. A stop watch will give greater precision to all work of this kind. After the velocities have been noted, the log is still allowed to drift until its direction is ascertained. This may be done either by measuring with a sextant the angle between a fixed object and the float, or by directing the sights of a compass toward the float. If the float is to the right of the object of reference, the angle is marked "R," if to the left, "L." This rule should be invariably followed in the· record. If observations are made with a compass, the direction should be recorded in degrees (not in points) and corrected for variation and deviation as indicated in the form for record. If circumstances pem1it, it is best to carry on simultaneously both sextant and compass observations. During the day, the float should carry a wind vane, small flag, or slender rod;· and during the night, a lantern. In comparatively narrow bodies of water the velocity of the current is often obtained by aid of two ranges transverse to the stream. The float is set adrift some distance above the upper range and picked up below the lower range. Observers stationed on the shore note the time when each range is passed. Greater precision can be attained if observers stationed on the shore make simultaneous observations upon the fl.oat by means of two theodolites. This is important wherever the lines of fl.ow are not known, or are not fixed in position for the varying phases of the tide. For convenience of reduction care should be taken to make current observations upon the exact hours and half hours. The time of the current's turning (middle of slack) should be carefully observed and recorded wherever slack water occurs. The direction and force of the wind, together with the appearance of rips, eddies, and 6ther interesting phenomena, should be observed and recorded.

6o. Current meters.

A current meter usually consists of a rotating meter wheel actuated by the impact of the water; a framework for supporting the wheel; a vane for causing the instrument to.lie parallel to the lines of motion of the current; a counterpoise for causing the suspended meter lo lie in a nearly horizontal position; a worm gear and wheels for recording the number of revolutions or preferably au electric connection with a recording apparatus located in the boat from which the meter is suspe1:ided. A float may be used for determining the direction when observations are made near the surface. One of the chief requisites. of current meters is uniformity of operation. Hence, all bearings and gears belonging to the meter proper should be tightly inclosed, if possible, thus placing them beyond the reach of the water and sediment. Woltmann's m.ill, and the J,neters of Fteley, Revy, and Moore, have counting devices in the instrument proper. The Henry, Price, and Haskell meters are electrially connected with the observing or recording apparatus . . For making observations at considerable depths, the meter must be provided with some means of determining the direction of the stream, and it is important that this may be done without the necessity of hauling up the meter.after each reading. Pillsbury's meter gives both velocity and direction, but has to be hauled up for reading. The Ritchie-Haskell direction meter bas a registering aparatus in the boat, but requires great care in manipulation. · If a revolving meter could be so constructed as to have its cups or small blades move with a velocity equal to that of the stream, then
v=2
1l 7r

r,

where n is the number of revolutions per second and r the radius or distance from the axis of rotation to the centers of the small cups or blades. The cup anemometer and the Price current meter partially fulfill these hypothetical requirements. If small oblique vanes were placed upon the circumference of a skeleton wheel so that the whole wheel would in some respects resemble a wind mill. and if I denote the . inclination of a vane to a line drawn parallel to the axis upon which the wheel revolves, then v denoting the velocity of the stream, the velocity of the rim of the wheel should be, in the case of no resistance, v tan I. Here v does not equal 2 n 7r ·r, but 2 n 7r r cot/. These simple illustrations show why one should expect to find current velocities to vary almost linearly with the number of revolutions. In practice other small terms come into the expression for v or· n, and so it is reasonable to assume that v is of the
form

61. Remarks on tlte use

ef meters.

Shortly before using a meter it must be carefully rated for various velocities, and it should be tested from time to time. This is usually accomplished by driving it at uniform rates through still water, the meter being attached to the prow of the boat and well submerged. The course over which the boat is driven being accurately known, and the various times and readings for each run being noted, it is not difficult to com~

334

pute a curve representing the rating. To do this, assume that observations or runs have been made giving directly the revolutions per second in each case, viz., nun 2 , · · · , nw and from the known times of going over the known course, the velocities in feet per second, viz;, v 11 v2 , · · · , vm- For convenience, write a, b, c for l ( =n°), n, n 2 , then if we assume that the velocity and number of revolutions per second are already connected by the relation v=a+fJn+yn2 where a, {J, y are constants to be determined, we have three linear equations for their determination, viz.

i=m ~ a,(a1a 1+b1,B,+c1y 1-nt) =o, i= I

(295)

£=1

i=m l j c1(a 1a 1+bifJ1+c1y 1-n1)=o.
£=I

If the velocity is to be measured at a depth of only a few feet below the surface, the meter is attached to a pole; if at a considerable depth, it must be suspended by a strong, slender cord or cable, and to the lower extremity of the meter sufficient weight should be attached for keeping the axis of the meter in a nearly horizontal position. In recording the observations the same form as that used in recording float observations can still be used. The number of revolutions should be written a little above the line with the corresponding velocity on the line. The depth at which the observation is taken should be written in the column of remarks. For details concerning the rating of meters, see "Accuracy of Stream Measurements,." by E. C. Murphy, pages 80 et seq. 'l'he current meter devised by Lieut. J.E. Pillsbury, U. S. N., is described in the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Reports, 1885, pages 495-501; 1890, pages 45<]--620. It consists, in part, of a cup meter and an enclosed compass, both placed within an open frame. The frame terminates in a heavy ball and is hung in gimbals, so that the weight of the ball secures the uprightness of the instrument at all times. The revolutions are counted by means of a worm gear and wheel register. The compass needle is locked as soon as hoisting of the instrument begins. Further references to measurements of the Gulf Stream made by this meter are the Survey reports for 1886, 1887, and 1889. There is little or no difficulty connected with the construction and operation of an electric meter which measures the velocity only, for an insulated wire can be carried down inside of or alongside of. the suspending cable to the axis of the meter wheel. A projection on the wheel near its axle comes into contact with this pole or end of the

wire, one or more times for each revolution. This closes the circuit and causes the movement of an armature on an electro-magnet; the armature in turn actuates the recording apparatus. The meters of Price and Haskell are of this character. Many greater difficulties arise in the determination of the direction of the current, especially if the meter is not to be hoisted in making the reading. The problem is to ascertain by electrical means the magnetic direction of the current. Orie means of accomplishing this requires that a suitably constmcted needle, swinging over a horizontal circle or ring, be inclosed in the body of the instrument. One electro-magnet in the body of the instrument is in circuit with the observing apparatus in the boat. The armature of this magnet, when the latter is magnetized and demagnetized by the observer in the boat, mechanically moves or rotates the horizontal ring under the needle until a contact is made between a metallic point situated upon it and a similar point on the needle or the case inclosing it. This contact closes a second circuit, which in turn opens the first. The position of a pointer in the receiving apparatus shows the direction of the needle at the time of observation. The moving horizontal ring or circular arc is brought back to its initial position by means of a spring when the observation is ended. In a general way this describes the direction current meter devised by Ritchie and Haskell. A brief description of the meter is given on pages 343~345 of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1891 (II). A meter ·for measuring the directions and velocities of ocean currents at various depths, invented by Prof. 0. Pettersson, is briefly described in Vol. I, Svenska Hydrografisk Biologiska Kommissionens Skrifter.
62. Miscellaneous apparatus and methods for observing currents.

A method of observing currents below the surface has been employed by W. Bell Dawson in St. Lawrence Bay.* A fan .consisting of two sheets of galvanized iron intersecting at right angles, suspended by sounding wire. The direction and inclination to the vertical of the wire near the surface are noted. The value of the velocity becomes known from a table constructed from actual observation. The velocity of the current can be measured by noting the angle of deviation of a pendulumlike body from the vertical. An apparatus adapted to this mode of measurement is called a hydrometric pendulum. Pitot's tube is an instrument which measures the velocity of the stream by means of the head of water sustained by the impulse of the stream. More or less elaborate types of this instrument are described in treatises on hydraulics. In case of very low velocities, such as those found at sea, it seems probable that floats are the only reliable apparatus. For a comparison of results obtained by means of different instruments and by different methods, reference may be made to Doctor Murphy's paper entitled "Accuracy of Stream Measurements," and especially to pages 4 7-59. .
63. Nonl1armonic reduction

of currents.

Unless the current observations extend over several weeks of time, it is generally advantageous to plot them upon cross-section paper. J'his is done by taking the times as abscissre and the velocities as ordinates of a curve. At the foot of each ordinate the direction is written, unless a second curve is constructed having times for abscissre

and directions for ordinates. Near the upper margin of the sheet containing the plotting or plottings, the tin.ies of high arid low waters at some·station to which it is proposed to refer the currents are indicated. In case no near-by or suitable station is available, the currents may be referred to the moon's transits, and these should be indicated near the upper margin of ~he sheet. For tidal rivers, straits, sounds, and other narrow bodie5 of water it is generally sufficient to tabulate the times of the maximum velocities and of the slack waters. In more open bodies of water, or wherever the current may be rotary in character, hourly values before and after the times of the high and low waters, or before and after the times of the moon's transit, should be tabulated. See tabulations in sections 95 and 96. By using multiples of twenty-four hou.rs for the length of the series tabulated, the diurnal inequalities will be nearly eliminated and the mean values of flood, ebb, etc., will be those pertllining to the semidaily wave. If there is no permanent current, the semidaily values obtained can be reduced to their mean values by means of the factor Mn/Mn', where Mn denotes the true mean range of. tide at the reference station and Mn' the mean range at the reference station for the period covered by the current series. In a short series, use in place of Mn' 1 the actuai range of each particular tide at the reference station. If there is a permanent fl.ow, this should be taken out in accordance with section 53 before applying this factor to the tidal current; it may then be restored. In the tables of current data, sections 83 and 90, both kinds of current are to be kept together as has generally been done. Only the harmonically analyzed currents are free from the permanent flow wherever such flow exists. On the maps (Figs. 5-17) the two kinds are kept separate.
64. Harmonic reduction

of currents.

'The advantage of harmonic over nonharmomc methods is even greater in the reduction of currents than in the reduction of tides, for current observations are much more irregular than tidal observations, and the quantities sought are frequently so small as to be completely hidden from view. A fairly good analysis can be made for a series of hourly observations extending over fifteen or twenty-nine days. These may be plotted on cross-section paper in the manner already described, but omitting the times of the high and low waters and the transits. . Whether plotted or not the hourly values of the current should be resolved into north:-and-south and east-and-west component velocities. This can be done either by means of an ordinary traverse table or graphically, using cross-section paper upon which is drawn a large circle divided into degrees and over vyhich moves a graduated arm, rotating about the center of the circle. The north-and-south values are written upon one sheet or set of sheets and the east-and-west upon another. To avoid negative numbers, one or more whole knots may be added to the true values. Each set of sheets is then summed for the current constituents in the same manner as would have been done had they contained. tidal ordinates. (See sec. 77, Part IL) The harmonic analysis as carried out here differs in no respect from that applied to the tides. When a series is only a few days in length, the most that analysis can give directly is a semidiumalJart, a diurnal· part, and possibly quarter daily part; these may be denoted by .d2 n, u· .d1 n, L11 e, .d.,,P Lf.,e· Now, about the only reasoning available is that in each of these waves the ratios between constituent amplitudes and the relative phases

o:r ages are the same as the corresponding ratios and ages in the tide wave. Assuming these quantities to be known for the tide, they become available for \nferring constituents of the currents from the observed Li1s. We are thus led to the problem: Given the harmonic tidal constituents for'a given station, required the amplitude and time or phase of the semidaily wave and of the daily wave for a particular day or for several days. These can be readily obtained from reliable predictions or from tidal record covering the period of current observation by summing and analyzing as if for currents. If no predictions are available, they can be made by some of the methods mentioned in sections 57-67, Part III. For this purpose the predictions need not be very elaborate. Having found the 'and R of any tidal constituent, C, the epoch and amplitude of the corresponding current constituent, C, are given by the relations

For obtaining the maximum and minimum velocities from the north and south components, see section 5 I. 65. Prediction

of currents.

If the tidal currents have but a small diurnal inequality, they can generally be predicted by applying differences to the predicted times of tides at a neaT-by station and suitable factors to the heights reckoned from mean sea level. At such stations the times of currents can be predicted by applying intervals (varying somewhat during the synodic half month) to the times of the moon's transit. · Where the diurnal inequalities are considerable, the currents do not generally correspond well with the tides. If sufficient observations are available, they may be tabulated according to two arguments, viz., the moon's transit and the day of year. Such tabulations. are available at once for making predictions. (Cf. sec. 59, Part I.) From suitable harmonic analyses the entire current ellipse for stations having rotary currents can be pre<}.icted by means of tide predicting machines. (Sec. 78, Part II). An ordinary machine will give at one setting one of the component velocities for as long a period of time as may be desired. .\nother setting will give the other component velocity. The two can be combined without difficulty by means of a right-angled triangle. If the machine have two sets of cranks and pulleys, and the two sets of cranks differ in phase by 90°, then by using principal directions the two motions can ga on at the same time. If the summation chains after passing over the pulleys cross each other perpendicularly, the distance between two fixed points upon them can be made to represent the velocity of the resultant current in both tl}agnitude and direction.

CHAPTER VI.
DESCRIPTIONS OF TIDAL CURRENTS.

66. Remarks on current charts.

Synoptical charts are referred to in the description of the tidal currents around the British Isles. They aini to show, without computation, the direction and velocity of the currents for the region covered, at each tidal hour. The fact that at least 6 or 12 charts are thus required, is in itself, a serious drawback. They are not convenient for showing how the times of the turning of the tide at different places compare with one another; for, several charts would have to be consulted, and hourly va~ues do not give such differences very closely. Such charts are, however well suited to the wants of the navigator. Mr. John Ross, of this Survey, has devised a form of chart for presenting current and tidal data, not over areas, but along a given path of commerce. The distance from an assumed point is one coordinate and the time with reference to a neai;-by tide the other coor«i;:linate. The tabular values are the velocity and sometimes the direction of the current; also, the time of local high and low water. A simple diagram accon:panies each chart; the object of the diagram is to enable the navigator to readily apply the values found upon the chart. Examples of such·charts are given in the Coast and Geodetic Survey Tide Tables, and Chart No. 1610 published by the United States. Hydrographic Office. A current hour is the Greenwich lunar time of a particular phase of the tidal current, Sa.y, of the-maximum flood. Generally speaking, the flood may be taken as the stream whose maximum velocity occurs after local low water and before or at local high water. In some rare cases where the maximum velocity occurs shortly after local high water, the stream may still be regarded as the flood . . In many localities a given stream if followed some distance will change its name' from flooq to ebb-the change occurring where the time of maximum flood is simultaneous with the time of local high water; similar remarks apply to the ebb. The necessity foi; changing the designation of a stream from flood to ebb, or vice vers!, shows the advantage of using not exactly the times of actual maximum velocities, but the times of the maximum of the regular semidaily velocities; in other words, the times of the M2 current stripped of the disturbing influences of the M,- and M6-currents. Some values of this regular semidaily current will be found in the table of harmonic constants given under section 97. These have been brought out by analyzing hourly values of the velocities generally resolved into north-and-south and east-and-west direction&. A good approximation to the M2-current hour can be obtained by taking the mean between the observed flood-current hour and the ebb-current hour, having first increased or decreased the .latter by 6. Another way is to take the mean between

APPENDIX 6.

CURRENTS, SHALLOW-WATER TIDES, ETC.

339

two consecutive slack-current hours. A still closer approximation is to take the mean between the flood-current hour, the ebb-current hour, increased or.decr~ed by 6; one slack hour, increased or decreased by 3; and the other by 9. The ebb arrows are not generally shown upon the cocurrent charts, because they are simply the reverse of the flood arrows;' when shown they are distinguished by a single barb. The permanent current is represented by the blunt-headed arrows. Where rotary currents are represented, the flood arrow is drawn in the usual way and the minimum velocity following the 'flood by 3 hours is shown by a line without barbs. Its length compared with the length of the flood arrow bears the ratio of the observed velocities. For convenience all flood arrows upon the same chart are of equal length; so, also, are the blunt arrows representing permanent strea~s. The velocities in knots in these two cases may be written upon or near the arrows. The tabular values given under s~ctions 95 and 96 contain whatever permanent cm:rent was running at the time when the observations were taken. When the current at a given station is referred to a tide at some point more or less distant, it is to be assumed that a common time is used for both places. When the current is referred to a transit of the moon, it may be assumed.that the transit refers to the local meridian.
67. Common characteristics of
curr~nts.

The effect of the combination of a nearly stationary stream with one rapidly progressive has been considered in section 49. The .former is often an on-and-off shore stream, the latter, one flowing nearly parallel to ·the shore line. Circular points occur most frequently where the stream divides, although not simultaneously, and much less frequently where two streams come together. If the current turn cloc!cwise, the order of the cocurrent lines is counterclockwise, and vice vers!\. Having a reliable map of cotidal lines, the time of turning, or of maximum velocity, of the tidal current through' a strait of moderate length can generally be inferred with considerable accuracy. The :twp cases which lend themselves 'to computation most readily are: 1. A narrow strait of varying cross section and whose length is only a small fraction of A. (A. being reckoned according to the depth of the strait), and wherein the motion is hydraulic because the velocity is so great that too many particles leave the strait proper for permitting the motion to become oscillatory. 2. A strait of such considerable length and of sufficiently great cross section (implying reduced velocity), for preventing more than a small fraction of the particles from leaving the strait (i. e., the strait proper and its approaches), and so causing the motion to become oscillatory. The motion pertaining to a narrow strait dies out rapidly in either tidal body connectt!d, while the motion of a broader strait is shared by the water for some distance beyond one or both ends of the strait. Where the current is hydraulic, the .greatest velocity toward the body having temporarily the lower level occurs when the downward slope in that direcuon is the greatest; such times can be taken directly from Table 60. Where the curemt is oscillatory, the greatest acceleration toward the body having temporarily the lower level occurs when the downward· slope in that direction is the greatest; such times can be taken directly from Table 60, but the maximum velocity in

340

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

the given direction occurs i-r (or three hours for a semidaily tide) later thau the time given in Table 60. Many examples of these cases will be given in the descriptions of tidal streams. A long shallow strait, especially if connecting shallow bodies, may have a progressive wave or current passing through it. If a strait have such dimensions that its current is partly progressive and partly stationary' the romputation of the times of greatest velocity at various points along the strait becomes more difficult and unsatisfactory. In small, sharp bays, in bays connected with the sea by means of tolerably broad straits, or in other small arms of the sea wherein the rise and fall of tide is nearly simultaneous with that outside, the slacks must occur at'. approximately the times of the tides. (See Chap. VIII; Part IV A.) . Another motion of a local character may be described here. This is what may be described as hydraulic:slope motion. If a stationary wave have an amplitude increasing (say) as one proceeds along a coast line, there is a tendency for any water along the shore not fully participating in the oscillatory motion, because of shore impedime~ts, to seek its level. Moreover, the gravitational action tending to produce motion is dire~t; it acts upon the littoral strip of water and produces motion in this strip, and differs from hydraulic motions in straits where gravity acts upon the bodies connected. The motion thus set up in the strip may be simultaneous notwithstanding the shallowness of the water and so the slow rate with which pulses would travel; this is so because gravity acts similarly all along the strip and produces motion throughout such a body simultaneously. The effect of this action is to cause the water along the lateral boundaries of a stationary wave to tum ·earlier than the water along the axis or central portion. Along the end boundaries of stationary waves (whether dependent or not), the current is weak and normal to the coast line.
68. Tidal currents for the world at large.

Tidal currents ~ave been observed only in comparatively shallow waters, such as the marginal strips next the coast lines, the waters overlying continental shelves and shoals, in sounds and other dependent bodies.· For this reason the information regarding tidal currents is very meager. In Figs. 5 and 6 an attempt has been made to bring together, chiefly from the Admiralty charts, the principal observational data relating to the direction of the ocean tidal currents. As remarked in section 30, Part IV B, the flood flows northerly- at the Baluchistan end, and southerly at the Madagascar end of the half-wave area extending between these coasts. It was also noted that the flood flows southeasterly through the Seychelle Archipelago, indicating the superposition of an east-and-west motion upon the northand-south motion of the area just mentioned. The currents of the Bay of Bengal are nearly normal to the coast, indicating the stationary character of the tide. The same is true for the waters northwest of Australiai south' of Cape Colony, southeast of Brazil, southeast of the Un~ted States, northeast of Brazil, off Panama, off Alaska, and probably south of Australia. Some further evidence bearing upon this will be noted below, especially in connection With quotations from the Admiralty Coast Pilots. Many localities have the controlling tidal streams running parallel to the shore. Such shores may be lateral boundaries of either a stationary or a progressive wave.

The eastern coast of Ceylon and Somaliland, and the outer coast of the Virgin Islands and California-all lying near nodal lines-are examples of the first case; while portions of western Europe, southern South America, western Oceanica, and many arms of the sea extending inland are examples of the second. ,, . The harmonic constants of stations off the Atlantic coast of the United States (sec. 97) show how very feeble the tidal currents become away from land;and near the end of a stationary wave; also how progressions into neighboring dcp~ndcnt arms of the sea cause transverse velocities often comparable with the velocities of the main oscillation.
69. Coasts of Africa.

On account of the regular outline of Africa and the comparative absence of offlying shoals and chains of islands, it is fair to assume that the movements of the ocean· extend to the very coast of the continent. The tidal currents as well as the tide should therefore be some index as to the character of the motion in the surrounding deep waters. The quotations given below arc taken from Parts I (1899), II (~901), and III (1897), of the African Pilot published by the Admiralty. The matters relating to the time~ and heights, of the tides are ·generally omitted, as such information can be obtained from the charts in Part IV B, this ·manual. Evidence of the half-wave area extending from Mozambique Channel to Baluchistan and India is afforded by the southwesterly set of the flood current at the northern end of the channel. · The fact that at the southern end of the channel flood sets northerly indicates that here is a loop of one or more stationary waves extending in a southt'rly direction. (See Fig. 23, Part IV A, and Fig. 1, Part IV B.) Evidence of an area whose motion is north and south with a loop near Cape Colony is afforded by the quotations which indicate small tidal streams around Table Bay and eastward. The smallness of the stream in the Gulf of Guinea is in accord with the rather small ranges of tide and the fact that this gulf does not partake of the general oscillatory movement of the South Atlantic system. The smallness of the currents off French Guinea and Sierra Leone indicates the proximity of a loop of the South Atlantic system. The considerable northeasterly flood through the Canary Islands indicates the existence of the North Atlantic system. A similar flood through the Azores indicates northerly progression due to openings northwest of Europe. At the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar the streams are weak while the range of . tide is considerable; they turn at nearly the times of high and low waters. The quotation relating to the Kongo River shows that the varying density of the water near the river's mouth has its influence upon the currents.

On the north shore of Mobilia the flood sets to the westward, but changes before the water bns done rising, as does the stream to the eastward before low water.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVIW REPORT, 1907.

St. Lazarus Bank: A regular tide was observed when at anchor on the bank, the flood setting E.S.E. about 4 hours, and the ebb W.N.W. about 7 hours, with about half an hour slack water; the strength at springs was 2 knots; the rise and fall, approximately, 12 feet. In the n<;>&thern part of Pemba channel, near the coast of Pemba island, the flood stream setting to the southward neutralizes and at times overcomes the constant north-going current, and the ebb accelerates it. It is high 'V~ter, full and change, in Kokotoni harbor, at 4h. iom.; springs rise 15 feet, neaps 10 feet. As a rule tq\\ flood runs southward, and the ebb northward. Zanzibar C.h"iwnel: The tidal streams, as a rule, are as follows: The flood runs southward in the northern part ol ~llnzibar channel, and in a contrary direction at tbe southern end, thus meeting at high water at a poil\t near the center, the position of which depends much upon the wind. Dar-es-salaam Bay: As a general rule, the flood runs north-westward, and the ebbin the contrary direction, but amon~t the islands and reefs the streams will of ten be found setting to the opposite points. Mafia Channel: The tidal streams are strong in all the channels, and along the shore; the flood stream run,iting sout)lward and towards the .shore, the ebb to the northward and off the shore. The direction of the tidal stream northward of Ras Kisimani is ebb to the northward and eastward, and flood to the southward. It is high water, full and change, at Kilwa Kivinje, at 4h. om.; springs rise about 12 feet. There is but little tidal stream at the anchorage. It is high water, full and change, in Lindi river, at 4I:i. 5m.; springs rise 11 feet. The tidal streams ih the bay, outside the bank of soundings are not strong. It is high water, full and change, at Mgau Mwania at 3h. 45m.; springs rise 12 feet; off the entrance the flood runs to the northward, and the ebb to the south-eastward, with a force of from 2 to 3 knots. . · It is high water, full and change, in Mikindani harbor at 3h. 5om.; springs rise 12 feet. The tidal stream in the harbor is scarcely perceptible. It is high water in Rovuma bay, full and change, at 4h. 10m.; springs rise 12 feet; the ebb running to the northward and flood to the south-eastward. In Maiyapa bay, the flood sets north-westward, and the ebb south-eastward at the rate of 2 to 4 knots at springs. Nyuni Pass: The flood sets north-westward from 2 to 3 knots at springs, but is scarcely perceptible at neaps. Nameguo Pass: The tidal streams within the outer reefs are irregular. It is high water at Kero Nyuni, full and change, at 4h. 15m.; springs rise 13 feet. It is high water, full and change, at Mozambique, at 4h. 15m.; springs rise 12 feet. The streams run strong in the harbour~the flood to the westward, the ebb to the eastward. The tidal rise in the mouths of the Zambezi is about 12 feet at springs; this amount is reduced to about 5 feet at Mchenga, situated about 25 miles above the entrances and 5 miles above the junction of the Chinde; the time of high water at Mchenga is 2t hours later than at the mouth of the Chinde, or 6h. 5om., full and change. Inhamissengo Mouth: It is high water, full and change, at 4h. 3om.; springs rise about 12 feet. The ebb tide at springs runs 4 to 4; knots in the entrance. Pungue River: The tidal streams are very strong, especially when the river is high; as much as 5 knots at springs have been observed at the junction of the Pungue and lluzi. It is high water, full and change, at lnnamban at 5h. 38m.; springs rise 11 feet, neaps 7 feet The stream runs strong in the river; off the town it sometimes amounts to 4 knots an hour. Delagoa Bay: Seaward of the shoals, the flood sets to the northward at the rate of 2 knots. Port Natal: In the port, the time of high water at full and change is 4h. 3om., springs rise 6 feet. The velocity of the ebb at springs is about 3 miles an hour in the Bluff channel and of the flood about 2i miles. In the road, outside the bar, the flood stream sets nearly north and the ebb in the opposite direction. Kei River: It is high water, full and change, at Kei river at about 4h. om.; springs rise about 5 feet. The flood stream sets north-eastward close in shore, and the ebb south-westward.

It is high water, full and change, at Port Elizabeth at 3h. 10m., and the rise is 6 feet; the tides are often irregular, being acted upon by the wind. The surface stream is uncertain in direction and inappreciable. It is high water, full and change, in Table bay at 2h. 4om.; springs rise 5 feet, neaps 3t feet. The duration of slack at high water vaiies considerably, and greatly depends on the prevailing wind; the water is never stationary more than 30 minutes, and frequently it begins to fall immediately on reaching high water There is no sensible stream of tide, either in the bay or on the adjacent coast. The time or high water and its rise is near!~ the same at Simons bay, and at all the bays along the coast from the Cape of Good Hope to Cape'Agulhas. Congo River: The observations appeared to show that the fresh water of the Congo extends from the surface to the bottom until the head of the Congo canon just below Kissanga, when it encounters a body of salt water filling this deep gully. It then runs over this denser water with decreased depth and increased velocity, the layer of fresh water being deeper with the ebb tide and shallower with the flood, both decreasing the broader the river becomes, until, from being from 3 to 5 fathoms deep just below Bull island, it is only a few feet deep after passing Bulambemba point. This deep body of salt water is either perfectly still, or has a very slight tidal flow (two-tenths to half a knot per hour) up river with the flood, and down with the ebb tide. Ambas Bay: The tidal streams appear to run both ways for an equal period; the flood setting to the south, and the ebb to the north out of Ambas bay between Ambas island and Pirate rocks New Calabar River: The ebb stream sets. over Baleur bank, the flood stream sometimes sets over the western shoals, but if the outside current is setting strongly to the eastward, the flood stream will be but little felt. Near Sand island both ebb and flood streams set toward that island. Off Bonny town the ebb stream runs from 3 to 3t knots an hour in a S. \V. by W. direction. It is high water, full and change, in Ramos river at 4h. 20m.; springs rise 5 feet. The ebb runs for 9 hours. Forcados River: On the bar, the flood tide sets across it to the northward, the ebb in the COI).trary direction, which must be allowed for. Benin River: The tidal stream in the river is said to sometimes run at a rate of 4 to 5 knots an hour. On the bar, the ebb stream sets to the westward and the flood about E. by N., but a set, toward the northern breakers, has been experienced on the flood. Banana Islands: The flood sets East and E.S.E.; the ebb W.S. \V. and W. by N.; rate 1 to 1t knots. Isles do Los: The flood stream sets to the N.E., and the ebb in ·contrary direction, with a rate of from 1 t to 1 t knots an hour at spring tides. At the entrance of the Nunez river the flood sets N.E. and ebb S.W. at rates of from 2 to 3 knots an hour. West of Talabuncha point the flood sets ·in a northerly, and ebb in a contrary, direction. Orange Channel: The ebb stream seldom exceeds 2t knots and the flood 1 ! knots an hour in velocity, except after heavy freshets in the rivers, the general direction of the flood stream being to the N.E., and the ebb to the S.W. The ebb stream in the Cacheo, as also off it, sets to· the N.E., and the flood to the S. \V. It is high water, full and change, in the Kasamanze river at 9h. 55m.; springs rise Si f~et. In the Great pass the flood stream has a tendency to set towards the north, and the ebb toward the south bank; the rates vary from 2 to 3 knots an hour. The tidal streams are felt so far as point Piedras, about 6o miles from the bar. Salum River: At Kaolack it is high water, full and change, at 6h. 5m. the rise and fall of tide is about 3t feet. The tidal streams run very strongly on the bar and in the narrow parts of the river, the stream of both flood and ebb continuing from 2 to 2t hours after high and low water, during which period there is no appreciable rise and fall until the stream turns. The flood tide entering at West pass sometimes attains a velocity of 3 knots an hour, and splits after crossing the bar. It is high water, full and change, between Sta. Lucia and Branca islands at 7h.; springs rise about 5 feet. The flood stream sets to the westward, and the ebb to the eastward with a velocity of 2 knots an hour during springs.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

Near the shore, at Cape Verde, the tidal streams are very appreciable, the flood dividing into two branches, one setting to the northward, the other toward Almadi point; the flood stream occasions strong and irregular currents in Yof bay; the ebb stream sets off shore. Senegal River: Abreast of this river, and for a space of several miles to seaward, the powerful tidal streams, both in and out, affect the general uniformity of the-southerly current, and are often so strong as to bring vessels, anchored in the outer road, with their broadsides to the wind in the strongest breezes. These outer tidal streams have no very regular set; the flood stream, however, generally runs E.N.E. and the ebb W.N.W. ' · It is high water, full and change, in Ouro river at oh. om.; springs rise 8 or 9 feet. Off the entrance the flood stream sets nearly east, and the ebb west, with a velocity of about 2t knots an hour Lanzarote Island: The flood streams run to E.N.E. and ebb stream in a contrary direction, the rate, at spring tides, being about 1 knot an hour. Lobos Island: The flood stream sets E.N.E. and ebb W.N.W. It is high water, full and change, in Santa Cruz bay at 1h 3om.; springs rise 8 feet, neaps 6 feet. The tidal streams set by the Dezerta islands during spring tides, at the rate of 1! to 2 miles per hour; the flood in the direction of N.E. by E., and the ebb S.W. by \V. Springs rise 7 feet. It is high water, full and change, in Funchal bay at oh. 48m.; prings rise 7 feet. The tidal wave strikes these [Madeira] islands nearly at the same time as the Azores, the flood stream running to the north-eastward at the rate of 1~ miles per'hour at spring tides, and in the narrow channels between Dezerta islands and off San Lourenzo point, it sometimes attains the velocity of 2 miles per hour. It is high water, full and change, in Mogador harbour at 1h. 18m.; springs rise 10 or 12 feet. The tides are generally regular in their rise and fall, but the direction of the tidal stream varies with the wind, and its strength is at all times weak. The flood stream in the offing north of Tangier hay runs from east to west, and the ebb in the reverse direction, turning in mid-channel at high and low water by the shore. In Fayal channel the flood stream sets N.E., and the ebb S. W., with a velocity of from 1 to 2 knots an hour. It is high water, full and change, at Corvo and Flores islands at oh. 20m.; springs rise 31 feet. The stream of flood tide runs.to N.E. by N. and the ebb S. W. by S., with a velocity of 1! knots per hour at springs; these tidal stream&, when opposed by gales, create a most confused sea off the north and south extremes of both islands.

The currents in the Straits of Gibraltar and Messina, and the Euripus, are described in sections 84-86, Part IV A. On account of the large rise and fall around the coasts of Spain, Portugal, and France, the currents are very strong in the tidal rivers. For brief accounts of these currents see Sailing Directions for the \Vest Coasts of France, Spain, and Portugal, published· by the Admiralty; also Etude Pratique sur les ::\farces Fluviales, by M. Comoy.
7r. The British Isles and the North Sea.

The behavior of the tidal currents in this region has long been understood. For instance, Barlow, on a map facing page 140 of his Exact Survey of the Tide (1717), shows the general direction taken by the flood stream in these waters, although he here aims at showing the advance of the tidal wave. A similar map for the northern part of the Irish Sea occurs between pages 152 and 153 of his treatise. The charts of Captain Beec;hey are briefly referred to in section 126, Part I, and two of these are reproduced as Figs. 27 and 28, Part IV A.

The character of the tide wave, whether progressive or stationary, is indicated upon a chart opposite page 125 of a book entitled "The Tides;" Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge ( 1857). In connection with the below descriptions it will be found advantageous to frequently consult section 44 and Figs. 20-22, Part IV B, in order to see the relations between the currents and the tides. ·. The English Channel and the Irish Sea contain stationary waves whose particles are at elongation inward at about the time of high water at Dover, or at abou.t XI Greenwich lunar time (Fig. 20; Part IV B). At this time the water is slack over nearly all of the Irish Sea, including the axis of the No!'th Channel, and over a portion of the English Channel north of Cherbourg. Three (lunar) hours before high water at Dover the flood is running strongly in the regions just mentioned, and three hours after high water the ebb is running strongly. The tendency of the apparently progressive part of the wave between the northwestern corner of France and the southern part of Ireland is to cause the inward stream to have its maximum velocity at IV instead of at XI - 3 or VIII. As a matter of fact, the greatest inward velocity here occurs about 4 hours after Dover high water, or at III. This indicates that the tidal wave in this region is partly stationary, as is generally the case in a marginal strip of shallow water lying between the deep water of the ocean and the land. In both the Bristol Channel and the Gulf of St. Malo, there is evidence from the cotidal chart of a stationary wave; for, in either case the rate of advance is greater than that due to depth. But toward the inner ~nds of these arms of water, where the tidal hour is VI, the greatest velocity of the flood stream occurs at about 2,Z hours before the time of high water there, or at about III!, Greenwich time. The effect of Bristol Bay upon the currents off the Scilly Islands is evidently to stop the northeasterly flood stream before the easterly stream slackens at this part of the English Channel. Hence the currents are here rotary in character and clockwise in rotation. The reverse must be true of the currents north of Cotes du Nord. The following quotation and table are taken from the Admiralty Tide Tables for the British and Irish P<?rts for the year 1907, and illustr~te what has just been said :
OfT the mouth of the English Channel the stream, although materially influenced by the indraft and outset of the Channel, will be found running to the northward and eastward, while the water is falling at Dover; and to the southward and westward while it is rising at that port. The particular direction given to the stream in this part of the sea, by the meeting of the Channel and of the offing tides, will be shown in the table [1st below]; and it is only necessary to. mention here, that to the southward of the parallel of Scilly, the tidal streams of the Channel and offing blend together with varying force and direction, and occasion the direction of the stream to be constantly changing, and in some places even to make the entire circuit of the compass in one tide, without ever remaining long upon any one point; so that any written description of their course is rendered almost impossible, and the table alone must be consulted for the direction at any particular hour. From this rotatory motion of the stream, it has been asserted that a vessel can never be carried far in any direction by it. Such, however, is not the case; for, although it may be true that while at anchor in a particular spot the vessel's head will turn to every point of the compass, yet directly she is loose she will be carried away upon a rhomb depending upon the state of the tide at Dover.

Jt should be remembered that the directions in the quotations from the Admiralty Tide Tables are magnetic. Concerning the streams near the Channel Islands the Tide Tables say:
Near Guernsey and to the northward of that island the true Channel stream prevails; the great body of the water running about E. by N. whilst the tide is rising at Dover, and about W.S. W. when it is falling at that place; but near Roches Douvres to the southward, the stream sets S.E. into the Gulf of St. Malo, from 2 hours after high water at Dover to 4 hours before high water there, and N. W. during the remainder of the tides. . Thus what is called tide and half tide prevails at Guernsey and amongst the islands to the northward; whilst at Jersey and along the southern shore of the gulf, and out to the westward toward Roches Douvres, the stream is more uniform and regular; the former resulting directly from the action

of the Channel stream, the latter from an interruption of the southern portion of that stream by the coast of France, and its diversion into the Gulf of St. Malo. The center of Deroute channel (between Roches Douvres and Guernsey) may be considered to mark the separating boundary of these two streams; for along this line and to the eastward they successively run together side by side, blend, and separate in alternating direction and force, depending on the state of the tide. It should here be noted that the tidal stream around and between the Channel islands has a rotatory motipn (evidently caused by the different action of the above-described two streams and the peculiar form of the shores of the gulf) from right to left, going right round the.compass in little more than 12 hours.

In the offing westward of Guernsey, the stream seldom attains a rate of 3 knots until the island is
approached within 4 or 5 miles, where it increases to 4' knots; in the Rt\.ssel channels it exceeds 5 knots, and it runs about the same rate between Jersey and the Minquiers; in the center of Deroute channel, between Jersey and Sark, its strength is barely 4 knots, and 3 knots farther westward between Guernsey and Roches Douvres; near Roches Douvres the rate appears to be knots; in the offing north of Alderney and the Casquets, 5' knots is not an uncommon rate for an ebb spring tide, and on similar occasions the Race and Swinge streams run more than 7 knots. The rapidity with which the tides rise and fall and their velocity are greatly influenced by strong north-eastern and south-western gales; the former retarding and the latter accelerating their progress in a remarkable degree; the latter will also cause the Race stream to run three-quarters of an hour longer to the north-eastward than usual, although the former has not a similar effect upon the stream when running to the south-westward. About one mile south of the bill of Portland, at half flood by the shore, or 4; h~urs after high water at Dover, the stream sets from S.S.E. to S.E. by E., and the opposite stream about W.S.W.; the velocity of both strea~s, at springs, being from 5 to 6 knots; but although they run with such violence near the Race, about one mile S. \V. of the bill they are weak.

Off Portland Bill the easterly velocity of the main stationary wave should have its greatest value at about XI - 3 or VIII. But the observed tidal hour for Portland Bill is VI. As a matter of fact, the greatest easterly velocity occurs at about VIIt, according to the Admiralty Tide Tables. The times of the greatest eastward velocity through Dover Strait can be inferred from the tides by noting the tidal hours and ranges off either end of the strait proper and ad.ding 3 hours to the values given by Table 60. The tide off the west end of the strait occurs at X~ hours, the mean range being 20 feet; the corresponding quantities for the east end are XIt and 12. Hence the time of maximum eastward downward slope is Xt- l .066 = 9.434; this increased by 3 hours gives XII.43 for the time of the maximum eastward current in the strait, which practically agrees with the results of observation. As already remarked, the principal current in the Irish Sea has its maximum inward velocity at XI - 3 or VIII. Just off St. David's Head this velocity is from 2 to 4 knots and around the Skerries from 2 to 5. West of the Isle of Man this velocity is very small. At the northern end of North Channel the tidal hour and mean range in feet are V.5 and 7, while for the southern end they are X.7 and 12. Using these values in Table 60 the time of maximum downward northward slope is X.98, and so, subtracting 3 hours from this value, the result is VII.98 for the time of the maximum southerly stream. Observation gives VIII as the current hour of the stream. The cotidal lines in the North Channel, and also those in the Irish Sea and English Channel, are much influenced by the transverse slope due to the deflecting force of the earth's axial rotation. Not so with the cocurrent lines; for, the transverse velocity is small in comparison with the velocity along the strait or channel. Hence, in a channel

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1907.

only moderately wide, and having a current of some magnitude, the cocurrent lines are frequently more simple in char.acter than are the cotidal lines. The reverse of this is often true along the irregular borders of open bodies of water and where the current is generally small. The following quotations from the Admiralty 'fide Tables partially describe the tides in the Irish Sea and adjacent waters:
72. In the Irish channel, as before observed, experiments have shown that, notwithstanding the variety of times of high water throughout the channel, the turn of the stream over all that part which may be called the fair navigable portion of the channel is nearly simultaneous; that the northern and southern streams in both channels commence and end in all parts (practically speaking) at nearly the same time; and that that time ha.ppens to correspond nearly with the time of high and low water on the shore at tlu: entrance of Liverpool and of Morecambe bay,* a spot remarkable as being the point where the opposite streams coming round the extremities of Ireland terminate. So that it is necessary only to know the times of high and low water at either of these places, to determine the hour when the stream of either tide will commence or terminate in any part of the channel. For this purpose the Uverpool tide table may be used, subtracting a quarter of an hour from the times there given, in consequence of the high water at George pier being later than the point which is considered as the head of the tide. The tidal undulation from the Atlantic enters the Irish channel by two channels; of which Carnsore point, the S.E. point of Ireland, and St. Davis head, the S. \V. point of Wales, arc the limits of the southern one; and Rathlin and the Mull of Cantyre the boundaries of the northern. The axis of the in-going stream runs nearly in a line from a point midway between the Tuskar and the Bishops, to·a position 16 miles due west of Holyhead; beyond which it begins to expand eastward and westward; but rts main body preserves its direction straight forward toward the Calf of Man, which it passes. to the eastward with increased velocity as far as L:mgn~ss point, and then at a more moderate rate on toward :\1aughold head. Here it is arrested by the southern stream from the 1\orth channel coming round the point of Ayr, and is first turned to the east ward by it, and then goes with it at an easy rate direct from 1\lorecambe bay; thus changing its direction nearly eight points. * * * * * * * The western part of the stream, after passing the Saltccs, runs nearly in the direction of the Tuskar, sets sharply round it, and then takes a N.E. direction, setting fairly along the coast, but over the banb skirting the shore, so that vessels tacking near the inner edge of the sands with the northeast-going stream, and on the outer edge on the opposite stream, have been carried upon them and lost, especially upon the Arklow and Codling banks. Abreast of Arklow is situated that remarkable spot in the Irish channel, where the tide scarcely either rises or falls. The stream not withstanding sweeps past it at the rate of 4 knots at springs, and reaches the parallel of Wicklow head. Herc it encounters a·n extensive projection of Codling bank; and while the outer portion takes the circuit of the bank, the inner stream sweeps over it, occasioning an overfall and strong rippling all round the edge, by which the bank may generally be recognized. Beyond this point the streams unite and flow on toward Howth and Lambay, growing gradually weaker as they proceed, until they ultimately expend themselves in a large space of still water situated between the Isle of Man and Carlingford. There we have not been able to detect any stream; for there another remarkable phenomenon occurs·--the water rising and falling without apparently any perceptible stream. This space of still water is marked by a bottom of blue mud. Such is the course of the flowing water of the Southern channel. In the North channel the stream enters between the :\lull of Cantyre and Rathlin island simultaneously with that passing the Tuskar into the Southern channel, but flows in the contrary direction. It runs at the rate of 3 knots at springs, increasing to 5 knots near the :\1ull, and to 4 near Tor point, on the opposite side of the channel. The eastern' branch of this stream turns round the Mull toward Ailsa

*The entrance of Liverpool and of Morecambe bay are, as before stated, 18 minutes earlier in their time of high water than those given for Liverpool in the tide tables. At N. \V. L. V., Liverpool bay, the flood stream sets in an ESE. direction, with a maximum rate at springs of 2! knots; the ebb WNW., 2 knots. At neaps the flood sets at the rate of r knot, the ebb three-quarters of a knot.

and the Clyde, a portion passing round Sanda up Kilbrennen sound and loch Fyne. The main body sweeps to the S. by E., taking nearly the general direction of the channel,1 but pressing more heavily on the Wigtonshire coast. Near the Mull of Galloway the stream increases in velocity to 5 knots; the eastern portion turns sharply round the promontory toward the Solway, and splits off St. Bees head, one portion runnin'g up the Solway and the other toward Morecambe bay.

73. The currents on the west coast of Scotland turn soon after the times of local high water, indicating that the wave is there chiefly stationary. Through the larger channels the current is nearly oscillatory, but through the short and narrow straits it is nearly hydraulic. (See Chap. VIII, Part IV A.) For example, the tidal hour just off the western end of Corrievrekin Strait is V.4 and that just off the southeastern cn.d IV.5; the mean ranges off these two ends are 7 and 4 feet, respectively. Using these values in Table 60, it follows that the greatest southeastward downward slope occurs at VI.2; observation gives .about VI.5 as the hour of the southeastward stream. Hence, the Corrievrekin is nearly hydraulic in character. The velocity of the strength of current varies from 4 to 8 knots. Before making very satisfactory computations of this kind, it will be necessary to have the times and the heights of the tide carefully observed. The currents in the Little Minch arc oscillatory. The tidal hours off the north and south ends of the strait arc VI.5 and V.5, while the ranges in feet arc 11· and 8. By Table 60 the greatest southward downward slope occurs at VIII. Subtracting 3 from this, the theoretical hour for the north-going stream is V. Observation gives V~. Scott, in The Lord of the Isles, thus speaks of the currents among the islands along the western coast of Scotland:

* 'your eye * could see *the mood * Or that Of Corryvrekin's whirlpool rude, When dons the Hag her whiten'd hood.
The following quotations from the Admiralty Tide Tables refer to the streams along the west coast of Scotland:
While the laws of the streams are thus of more importance than the laws of the rise and fall of the tide, they are also much more simple. The times of high and low water are very different at different parts of the coast, while the times of slack water are nearly the same throughout the whole region in question. In a great part of this region the stream has no distinct title to be considered either a flood or an ebb stream, although at any point it generally flows for six hours in one direction, and for six hours in the opposite direction. the Mull of Cantyre and the north-east coast of Ireland, the most westerly part o( the north-going stream turns to the west, and runs through the sound of RathliT' along the north coast

of Ireland; the central part flows to the north-west past the Rhynns of Islay; the easterly part, which has flowed partly through tbe sound of Sanda, turns sharply round the Mull of Cantyre, and flows to the northward, pouring with great velocity through the narrow openings in the chain of islands, viz.: the sound of Islay, between Islay and Jura, the gulf of Coirebhreacain between Jura and Scarba, the little Coirebhreacain. between Scarba and Lunga, the Slate isles and Cuan sound; of these, the little Coirebhreacain is quite impassable; and Coirebhreacain and Cuan sound are seldom attempted except near slack water. Great complication arises from describing the time of change of the stream by reference to the time of high and low water on the shore; thus we should have to say that in the sound of Sanda, the ebb stream begins two hours before high water; at the Mull of Cantyre, one hour before high water; a little north of this, again two hours before high water. Southward of Gigha, we might say indifferently, that the flood tide runs to the south and begins three hours before low water, or that it runs to the north and begins three hours after low water; in the sound of islay and in the gulf of Coirebhreacain that it begins an hour before low water; and in describing the streams along the north coast of Ireland we have even greater complication. · The direction of the tidal streams on the rest of the West coast of Scotland may be thus described: Outside of Islay and Iona the streams turn at the time of high and low water at Liverpool, running southward with the rising and northward with the falling tide at that place. At the northern end of the passage of Tiree the streams change at 1 ! hours, at the southern end of the Little Minch at from three to four hours, and at the northern end at from four to five hours after high and low water at Liverpool; the time of the tum of the streams being thus gradually retarded as we proceed north. In the sound of Mu\1 there is the same retardation, the streams turning at the southern end at one hour before, and at the northern end half an hour after, high and low water at Liverpool, and flowing in the same direction as above mentioned. Round the north end of the island of Lewis, the stream bends into the Minch and meets the stream from the southward, the course of both streams being nearly the same as if there were an embankment from· 1och Shell in the island of Lewis to Ru Rea on the coast of Ross-shire. At the same time, another branch of the stream which has rounded Ardnamurchan poiilt flows through Sleat sound, and being an hour earlier than the tide which has rounded the north end of Skye, it pours with great velocity through Kyle Rhea, but owing to the undulations round Skye meeting near Kyle Akin there is very little stream through that narrow opening; the flood stream, as it is stated, sometimes flowing in one direction and sometimes in the other, according to the prevailing winds.

74. The tide wave along the eastern coast of Scotland and England as far south as Flamborough Head is progressive in character as might be inferred from the cotidal charts, Figs. 21, 22, Part IV B. Now, observation shows that the currents follow this coast and attain their maximum flood velocities at about the times of local high water. The comer of the sea lying between England and Holland and Belgium is characterized by a stationary oscillation (sec. 44, Part IV B) which is very apparent in the currents. Being an arm of an almost tideless sea sustained by the rise and fall in the Dover Strait, the northeastern stream should occur at XI+ 3, or II, a fact agreeUig with observation. The tidal hours of the estuaries of the Scheide and Meuse ranges from XII to II. The east-going stream in the offing ,Pccurring at II, it follows that since the estuaries must contain tide waves, stationary in part, the times of greatest. influx must be somewhat earlier than the times of tide. Observation shows that the greatest influx occurs from XII to I o'clock, or from 2 to 1 hours earlier than the greatest easterly stream in the offing. Van Der Stok finds that at Schouwenbank L.V. the currents are rotary and counterclockwise as they should be in a case of this kind. (See table under sec. 97.)

The southeastern comer of the North Sea contains a tide wave stationary in part. This might be inferred from Fig. 22, Part IV B; but the greatest flood stream around Helgoland Island occurs 1~ hours before local high water. The tidal streams in the approaches to the Baltic Sea are everywhere weak. The famous Malstrom or Moskenstrom in the Lofoten Islands can possess no very unusual strength, because the mean range of tide is there only 6 feet, and the time of high or low water must be about the same for the whole region concerned in the production of the whirlpool. (Fig. 23, Part IV B.) Barlow gives a map (opposite p. 196 of his treatise) showing the streams of this region and the whirlpool itself. The Malstrom is described at some length in Part II of the Norway Pilot, 2d ed., pp. 400-401, 422-424.

As already explained in section 73, Part IV A, and sections 34-40, Part IV B, the tides along the coast of America from Cape Race, Newfoundland, to Florida, result from a stationary wave extending from this coast in a southeasterly direction. The tidal hour of the American loop of this wave being XII, it follows that well off the coast the current t11our should be IX. As the northwestern edge of the ocean basin is approached this hour changes little or considerable, according to circumstances. From New York entrance to Savannah, observations made a few miles off the coast indicate, with scarcely an exception, that the northwesterly or westerly component of the current is running with the greatest velocity at a little after IX. Stations off New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina are given in the accompanying table. Since the first nodal line of the stationary tidal oscillation terminates near Guadeloupe Island, it follows that the times of tide for the northern coasts of Cuba, Haiti, Porto Rico, and the Virgin Islands can not differ very much from XII. (See Fig. 11, Part IV B.) If the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea be regarded as tideless bodies, it follows that the greatest southward downward slope through Florida Strait, Windward Passag~. and Mona Passage must occur at about the time of high water outside. Straits of these dimensions, especially if connecting deep bodies of water, must contain stationary waves. ·Consequently the maximum southward velocities must occur about 3 hours after the time of high water off their northern openings. ·The inward current hour (ebb) should therefore be in the neighborhood of XII+ 3, or III. Observation gives for Florida .Strait off Fowey Rocks Il.3, and near the western end of the strait III.a as the current

352

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

hours. For Windward Passage the observed hour is III.4, for :\fona Passage Il.7, and , for Vieques Passage III.1: The same thing is nearly true of the tide in the Lesser Antilles. Between Barbados and Tobago the current hour of the westerly stream is Xl.78 and between St. Vincent and St. Lucia the hour is X.34. The tidal hour is VII. This being increased by 3 hours gives X for the current hour, assuming the oscillation to be stationary. The principal part of ·the tide in the Gulf of St. Lawrence is a fractional stationary wave whose node is north of the Magdalen Islands and whose loop is the St. Lawrence Estuary. (See sec. 91, Part IV A.) The tidal hour of this loop is about VI; hence if there were no progression the current hour for the in-going stream should be III. An inspection of the map (Fig. 13, Part IV B) will show that high w:::i.ter for the northeastern arm of the gulf occurs at a trifle before II; consequently water 1nust be most rapidly flowing northeastward at a little before XI, or II - 3; hence the current hour ~lown on Fig. 7. Just outside of Cabot Strait the ocean wave is partly stationary, with a tendency to a maximum northwesterly velocity at IX, and partly progressive, owing to the irregularities in the shore line and the progression existing in the gulf, with a tendency to a maximum velocity at XII. The observed maximum velocity in the strait occurs at XI. But, as already stated, the westerly velocity of the stationary wave north of Magdalen Islands is about III. So far as velocities are concerned, a progressive wave affects a stationary wave least near a nodal line, and most at the end from which the progressive wave seems to come. Hence the tendency for the_ cocurrent lines to bunch up toward Cabot Strait rather than at the node. The hours for the west-going stream change from XI at Cabot Strait to a little less than III off the Magdalen Islands. The rapidly changing stream is intersected by the stationary stream filling or emptying the northeastern corner of the gulf. They intersect at right angles, have equal velocities, and phase difference of 3 hours at the point shown in Fig. 7, from which the cocurrent lines radiate. The hour of the stationary stream is X~ or IV~, and of the progressive It. The current in the Strait of Belle Isle is oscillatory. At the outer end the tidal hour is X and at the inner end II; the mean ranges are 2! and 3! feet, respectively. These values, substituted in Table 60, give, when increased by 3 hours, Xl.8 o'clock for the ti119 of maximum inward velocity. Observation makes the hour off Armour Point a trifle over XII!. As already noted, the stream flowing out of the northeast angle of the gulf in a southwesterly direction is swiftest at IVt; consequently off the inner end of the strait the current hour must change from I to IV t if the west-going stream be followed. The mean maximum velocity off Armour Point is about 11 knots. Above its estuary, the St. Lawrence River has a tidal wave nearly progressive in character, arid so the flood continues a considerable time after local high water and the ebb, after local low water. In comparing the chart of cotidal lines (Fig. 13, Part IV B) with the cocurrent chart (Fig. 7, Part V) it must be remembered that here and elsewhere the cotidal lines refer to actual (not the l'v1 2 ) high water, while the cocurrent lines refer to the time obtained by usin.g the maxima of both flood and ebb (adding 6 lunar hours to the latter) or to the M2-current. Where river stations are involved, an M2 cotidal map would be preferable to one referring to actual high water for making comparisons with the currents. At Quebec, the M2 high water is nearly one-half lunar hour behind the actual high water.

The spring velocity of the tidal current in the narrows of the South Traverse is knots. , The tidal current between Anticosti Island and the mainland north of it is a stationary oscillatory stream. The tidal hours off the east and west ends of this strait are II.5 and V.6, respectively, while the mean ranges of tide are 3 and 5 feet. The time ascertained by Table 60 when decreased by 3 hours gives 111.6 as the current hour of the west-going stream. The current in the narrow part of Northumberland Strait is also oscillatory, as can be seen by noting the tidal hours and ranges at the ends and applying Table 60. The values II! and 5 for the east end and XII! and 2 for the west end give, upon subtracting 3 hours from the value in Table 60, XII o'clock for the time of greatest eastward current. Near the narrowest part of the strait the flood stream turns to ebb and the cocurrent lines, if drawn, would bunch up together. The numbers between XI and IV have been omitted on the map. North of Prince Edward Island the transition from flood to ebb is less sudden. Through the Gut of Canso the streams are hydraulic. The hours and ranges in feet for the two ends being XI.5, XII.7, and 4, 2!; the value from Table 60 is X.3. Off Cape Porcupine the rate of flood or ebb is 4 knots.

76. Gulf of Maine. As explained in sections 34, 91, Part IV A, and section 39, Part IV B, the ocean tide wave supports an oscillation of approximately critical length in the Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy by means of an intermediate progressive wave which is in evidence at Georges Bank. Here, where the range of the stationary dependent wave is small, the progressive wave greatly influences the times of the resultant observed tides. In approaching this bank from deep water, and by the time the maximum flood reaches the center of it,. the current hour changes from IX! to XII!,' the change taking place chiefly at the loop of the. oceanic oscillation. Observation shows that the time of current increases less than half an hour between Georges Bank, where it is XII!, and the regular shore line 175 miles to the northwest. This is shown in Fig. 7. In the central portion of the Bay of Fundy the current hour is I. Along the shores of the bay the current turns earlier because its motion being there partially arrested by the irregularities of the shore line, the hydraulic tendency to flow into or out of the bay in accordance with the surface slope comes into existence. Because of the narrow channel above the city of St. John, the tides produce two falls each way daily, the slack waters oceurring when the river and the bay are upon the same level. The flow is strong in consequence of there being an average maximum head of nearly ro feet. .(See Fig. lJ, Part IV B.) In the center of the passage to the Basin of Mines, the spring maximum velocity is 5 to 6 knots, while near Cape Split it is 7 or 8 knots.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

In so far as the currents in the Gulf of Maine are rotary, the rotation is clockwise. East of Cape Cod Peninsula the cold permanent current setting southward is apparent.

77. Nantucket Shoals to Narragansett Bay.
From what has been said concerning the westerly ocean currents at about IX o'clock and the northerly current into the Gulf of Maine at about XII!, it is reasonable to expect a circular point in the neighborhood of Nantucket Ught Vessel (or where the stream, in ·a sense, divides), and that the rotation of currents on Nantucket Shoals should be clockwise as a rule. So far as observations have been made they go to verify these conclusions. Easterly from this point, the progression of the hours is northward, and westerly from the point, the progression is southward. This indicates that the progression upon Georges Bank controls in the first region, while the progression over the shoals southeast of Nantucket controls in the second. In other words, we are to imagine about half of the scheme illustrated by Fig. 4 to be in each locality; in either case the north and south motions are simultaneous across the lines marked XII and IX. All observed currents off Nantucket which are rotary turn clockwise. The fact that the current intervals increase in going southward and southwestward along the coast of Nantucket Island, while the tidal intervals increase rapidly in the opposite direction, was noted by Schott more than 50 years ago, on page 163 of a paper relating to the currents on Nantucket Shoals and published in the Coast Survey Report for 1854. Upon referring to Fig. 8 it will be seen that the current hour for the easterly going , stream increases tlirough Vineyard Sound to a late region northeast of Cape Poge; farther east the hour of the main stream continues to decrease to a little east of Great Point; still farther east the hour of the main current increases, but the direction of flood veers to northward. Along the eastern shore of Monomoy Peninsula is a region about 2! hours earlier than that cast of Great Point. This is caused by the hydraulic effect along the coast, the downward northerly slope of the water being greatest at about the time of low tide at Provincetown or IX!. One may therefore go westerly from this early region to the late region marked I, northeast of Cape Poge, and find the current hour invariably increasing. Other early regions are located inside of Great Point and of Monomoy Point. These bays are simply filled and drained nearly simultaneously with the rising and falling of the tide in the main body of the sound. The currents (filling) have their greatest velocity 2 or 3 hours before the times of high water. The west-going stream of the sound occurs only 2 or 3 hours after these times of influx into the dependent arms or bays. Consequently, their times of most rapid filling must gradually merge into the times of the swiftest west-going stream in the main body of the sound. The currents through Muskeget Channel and Edgartown Harbor (when open to the south) are hydraulic, as can be seen upon substituting the ranges and tidal hours off the ends of these channels, as found on Fig. 15, Part IV B, in Table 60. The tidal hours for Muskeget Channel arc XII.5 and IV.2, while the ranges are 3 and 2! feet; therefore the north-going stream should be XI.5. Observation gives XII - . In Quicks Hole and other openings between Buzzards Bay and Vineyard Sound, the currents are hydraulic. Because of these openings and the proximity to the entrance to Vineyard

Sound, the current hour increases from the northwestern shore of Buzzards Bay, where it is about IX!, toward the southeastern shore, consisting of islands, where the hour varies from X to XI. Narragansett Bay has a nearly stationary tide wave, and has few belating dependencies or connections; hence the time of current must be about 3 hours before the time of high water, and this observation shows it to be the case; the tidal hour for the bay varies from XII to XII! and the current hour from IX to IX.Z. 78. Long I stand Sound. The tide of Long Island Sound consists chiefly of a stationary wave approximately The tidal hour for this wave as inferred from the time of tide near the loop is IV. Observation shows that the current hour for the sound is I or a trifle over. The transition of the stationary Atlantic wave to the dependent wave of the sound is apparent many miles southward of Montauk Point, because here the ocean .is comparatively shallow and because the time difference between the ocean and sound is considerable. The late current entering the sound joins, near the nodal line, two early stationary waves or currents, one being that of the ocean to the south, the other, that of Narragansett Bay to the northeast. Hence the two circular points near the entrance to the sound. Near the southern point the rotation of the current is clockwise, and near the northern point counterclockwise. It may be noted that even in the region south and southeasterly from Montauk Point, where the current is as late as XI o'clock, there is a westerly component at about iX; this part of the current belongs to the Atlantic oscillation. A cocurrent line marked IX extends from southern Nova Scotia southeasterly probably to a point eastward from Porto Rico. Observations made east of Desiderade Island show a northwesterly current at VIII.29. This agrees with the horizontal motion belonging to the stationary wave wh~ch causes the tides along the Atlantic coast of the United States. A line marked IX! extends from Nova ~cotia, outside of Georges Bank, to the circular point off Virginia, and is shown in Figs. 7 and 17. The character and extent of the cocurrent lines between the lines just referred to and the land, can be ascertained by means of the accompanying maps. The belating effect of Long Island Sound is very apparent, while. the similar effect for New York Harbor is not great, because the time of the tide in the Lower Bay is not much later than that of the ocean. At the eastern end of Long Island Sound the current is considerable, because a north-and-south line i "A from the head of the sound would fall not far to the east of Montauk Point. Moreover, Plum, Great Gull, and Fishers Islands partially obstruct the passageway, thus necessitating increased velocities for maintaining a given rise and fall at the head of the sound. In the Race the velocity is 3 knots. The current hour for the greater part of the sound lies between I and Il Near the northern shore the current hour is less than I. In Fishers Sound it is XI1. This acceleration is due to the direct action of gravity upon the shore waters when possessing an eastward or westward slope. The similar effect is not equally great near the south shore of the sound, because the regularity of the shore line there permits the oscillation to extend very near to the land; but in the bays on that side the current ~s early, owing to the fact that they must be filling most rapidly 3 hours before high water. In entering tidal rivers where the tide wave soon becomes nearly progressive the current hour must change rapidly. (See Figs. 9-11.)

79. East River.

The tidal hour at and just east of Throgs Neck is III.8; in New York Upper Bay the tidal hour is XII.7. The mean ran~ in the former locality is 7.2 feet, in the latter 4+ By means of Table 60 it follows that the maximum eastward current should occur at X.8. Observation shows that from Throgs Neck to the eastern side of Governors Island the time of current changes by only 1 hour, viz., from X' to XI,. Just east of the line marked X and IV, the former for the east-going stream, the latter for the one going west, the stream changes in name from flood to ebb, or vice versa, according as in passing beyond this line the maximum stream follows high water or low water instead of preceding it, as a true flood or ebb is supposed to do. Off either shore of the northerly end of Blackwells Island the velocity of flood or ebb is 4 knots. Eddies occur in Pot Cove, Astoria Cove, and Wallabout Bay. The times of current in the sharp bays bordering the East River are governed by the times of their high and low waters, the current preceding the tide by 3 hours.
80. New Yark Harbor and Hudson River.

Both coasts of Sandy Hook have early currents (even earlier than IX), due to the direct effect of gravity tending to cause the greatest motion when the slope of the surface of water along the coasts is greatest. There is probably a circular point very near the New Jersey coast north of Barnegat Inlet, at which the IX and IX! lines lying off the coast terminate. The X line from the circular point off Virginia probably also terminates here. In passing through Fire Island Inlet the current hour changes from less than IX outside to more than X at the inner end of this strait. But, as can be seen from Fig. 12, the current hour changes little in going through Rockaway Inlet" into Jamaica Bay. Because of rapid change in time in going through Fire Island Inlet and the opposite . directions of the flood current without and within the inl_et, the complete representation of the current at the mouth of the inlet requires a circular point around which the numbering of the lines is counterclockwise, and so the rotation of the near-by currents must be clockwise. At the entrance to Rockaway Inlet the current simply splits, there being wedge of dead water between the two branches. No recent observations have been made close to the point of Sandy Hook; but Mitchell found there an almost continuous outward tidal current caused by the fact that an eddy was formed just within the hook on the flood stream, but none was formed there on the ebb. It seems probable that a similar condition exists now notwithstanding the variations which the hook has since undergone. The tide in Raritan Bay consists chiefly of a stationary wave increasing in range to the westward. Hence the greatest downward and northeastward slope along the Staten Island shore occurs not far from the time of high water. The direct effect of gravity is to produce a northeasterly going stream at about this time, or a little later. The stationary character of the Raritan Bay tide causes maximum flood to occur at about IX' while the progressive character of the Upper Bay and Hudson River tide causes current hour off Coney Island to be XI. Hence, the times of the northeasterly going stream must vary from XI to III1 along the Staten Island shore, while the onshore stream occurs at X; hence,· the circular point.

The feeble currents in Gravesend and Gowanus bays are earlier by from 1 hour hours than are· the currents in the middle of the channel. Just south of Battery Park is a wedge of nearly tide less water, lying between the Hudson and East ~ivers. Because of this fact, the permanent flow of the Hudson generally dominates the current. In the Kill van Kull the current is 2! hours earlier than in the channel of the Hudson opposite the mouth of this stream. The fact is of some importance with reference to any sewerage which may be discharged into the Kill van Kull on the ebb tide; for, it will, in the first place, be carried southward a considerable distance. The currents through both kills are hydraulic as can be seen upon noting times and ranges of tide in Newark Bay and the waters outside ·of it. The circular point in Newark Bay indicates that, following one stream, the times (current hours) of this stream vary much within a short distance. In other words, the streams coming from opposite directions are approximately simultaneous. The currents of Newark Bay, following in the general direction of the eastern and western shores has X! as its hour in the southern part of the bay. The flood current in the lower Hudson has its greatest velocity at about the time of local high water, indicating the progressive character of the tide wave. Where the fresh and salt water meet there is a tendency for the light fresh water to lie at and near the surface while the more dense salt water occupies the lower layers of the stream. Hence the observed surface current may have a strong permanent current, while near the bottom this permanent current will be much weaker. Hence the times' of slack water may be greatly disturbed at the surface and remain comparatively regular near the bottom. The observations of Mitchell and Marindin have shown that the flood slackens early at the surface in comparison with its time of slackening at the bottom. The reverse occurs at the slackening of the ebb stream.* In t:he upper Hudson the tide wave becomes partially stationary so that the greatest flood velocity finally occurs two or more !fours before the time of local high water. to

8r. Delaware and Chesapeake Bays.

The greatest velocity of the flood current in lower Delaware Bay occurs about

2! hours before the time of local high water. This gives further evidence that the
tide wave of the bay is nearly stationary in character. In the river, on the other hand, the tide must be nearly progressive; hence, the crowding together of the cocurrent lines in the upper portion of the bay. Along the sides of the lower part of the bay, the time of the current is influenced by the direct effect of gravity upon these waters which only in part partakes of the oscillatory motion. Hence, its early time of turning or of running flood or ebb. Off Cape Henlopen the mean maximum velocity is r.8 knots, at New Castle 2.6, and at Philadelphia it is 1 + In following the coast southward from Cape Henlopen the current becomes later. As the Virginia line is approached the velocity along the coast and that normal to the coast are very small. Observation shows the current in this region to be rotary and in the clockwise sense. This implies tha·t the order of the cocurrent lines about the. near-by circular point be counterclockwise, or opposite to the order for the circular point just east of the New Jersey coast. - - - - - - - - - ---------------------- ----··------- -------- ·--·-·-··-- - - - - - - - - - - *U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Report, 1887, pp. 301-312

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1907.

The IXz line setting out from the circular point of the Virginia coast passes near the outside of Georges Bank thence to southern Nova Scotia. On account of the progressive character of the tide in Chesapeake Bay, the times of the currents are delayed for some considerable distance outside of 1ihe capes. Between the capes the current-hour is XII~, while in the water beyond its influence the hour is probably a little under IXz. Hence the crowding up of the cocurrent lines in approaching the entrance to the bay. The bay being a propagative body, the maximum flood velocity occurs at nearly the time of local high water. Many of the dependent arms of water intersecting the general shore line must have tides of a partially stationary character. Hence, there occur many localities such that the current hour increases toward the bay, and generally inland as well. These may be styled "early regions." They are made apparent through the convention of always writing the numbers on the later sides of the lines. The following are examples: Pocomoke Sound; Fishing Bay; Honea River; Choptank River, near entrance; Eastern Bay; Chester River, near entrance; Sassafras River, near entrance; Gunpowder River; Patapsco River; Magothy River, near entrance; Severn River; South River; Herring Bay; Patuxent River, near entrance; St. Mary River; Great Wicomico River, near entrance; Rappahannock River, near entrance; Piankatank River, near entrance; Mobjack Bay; entrance to York River; Hampton Roads; Elizabeth River. The intervals and ranges indicate that near the head of the bay the tide wave is in part stationary. The early currents at this end of the bay give further confirmation of this hypothesis. At Baltimore harbor the tide wave is entirely stationary; for, current _observations made by F. A. Kummell near Fort ;\kHenry show that the northwesterly velocity is there greatest 3 hours before the time of high water. In the acute angle between the axes of the Patapsco River and of upper Chesapeake Bay the currents are rotary; but this fact has not been represented upon the map because of the small extent of the locality in question. The current near the heads of the Ja~es, Rappahannock, and Potomac Rivers is made early by the sudden changes in cross section and elevation of the river beds. The same is true of the lower Susquehanna, and of the Delaware at Philadelphia. The velocity of the current between the Capes is about 1 knot. Off the mouth of the Rappahannock the velocity is 0.50 knot; off the Patuxent, 0.39 knot; off Herring Bay, 0.32 knot; off Sandy Point, o.66 knot.
82. Florida Strait.

As already noted, the current in Florida Strait of the semidaily tide indicates that the tide wave is here partly stationary. The diurnal tide should here be a stationary wave, and with greater reason, because the length of the strait is a smaller fraction of A. in the latter case than in the former. Consider the diurnal tide at Fernandina and Key West, Fla. From section 97, Part IV A, we have at the· two places K 1 =0.34, K 0 1 = 120°; K 1 =0.27, K 0 1 =274. The 0 1 's at the two places compare in about the same manner and will, for convenience, not be considered.· The longitude of Fernandina is 5.43 hours and of Key West 5.45. The K 1 tidal hours at the two places are therefore XIII.43 and XXIII.72, respectively.

APPENDIX 6.

CVRRENTS, SHALLOW-WATER TIDES, ETC.

These differ by 10.29 hours. Hence, there should be almost a nodal line. for the Kitide in Florida Strait. An harmonic analysis of 191~ days at Cape Florida, beginning February 15, 1857, gives the following constants, not corrected for imperfect elimination: Ki =0.0857 foot, K~= 189°.09, K 2 =0.0408 foot, K2= 286°.89. M2 =0.7654 foot, M~= 244°.36, Oi =0.0714 foot. 0~= 205°.91, S2 =0.1337 foot, S~=279°.47.
It is thus seen that at this point the diurnal tide is small in comparison with the semidiurnal. This fact was anticipated before the analysis was undertaken. To infer the Ki-current, take the tidal hours and amplitude ratio for Fernandina and Key West, and make use of Table 60. The time of greatest southward, downward slope is thus found to be XII.7; consequently the tidal hour of the maximum southgoing stream is XII.7 + 6= XVIII.7. From the reduction for the observations off Fowey Rocks, longitude 5.33 K~ (north) is 14°=0.93 hour. Hence, the observed current-hour for the south-going K 1 current is 5.33 + 0.93 + 12 = XVIII.26, which agrees well with inference. The diurnal current flowing into the Gulf of Mexico through the Yucatan Channel should have its greatest velocity 6 hours before diurnal high water over the Gulf, or at II -6=XX. (See Nos. 113-148, Section 97, Part IV A.) Observation gives 248°.6 for the epoch of the K 1 north-going current at a point whose longitude is 5.75 hours. Hence, the current hour is XXII.32.

84. Coasts of South America.

Like Africa, South America is exposed to the direct action of the deep ocean tide; and so observations made upon tides and currents have an important bearing upon the general problem of the tides. The quotations given below are taken from the Admiralty Pilots for South America, Part I (1893), Part II (1895), and for the West Indies, Vol. I (1893). They indicate the ending of one stationary wave against the southeastern coast of Brazil, and another against the northern coast. They also indicate a loop of a stationary wave in the Gulf of Panama. · They show how in dependent stationary arms of the sea, like those along the eastern coa~: of Patagonia, the velocity of the tidal streams may be small while the range of tide is exceptionally great. There is good evidence from the tides, and possibly some evidence from the currents, of the ending of a stationary wave along the Chilean coast. Both currents and tides indicate the southerly and southeasterly direction of the flood as Cape Hom is approached. Both currents and tides indicate that the general direction of the flood along the eastern coast of South ·America from Staten Island to Rio de la Plata is northerly. One remark concerning the tides off the mouth of the Rio Negro indicates that their establishments change rapidly in going a comparatively short distance. (Cf. Fig. 29, Part IV B.) 85. Southeast coast of South America, quotations.
It is high water, full and change, at cape St. Roque at 4h. 14m.; springs rise from 8 to JO feet. In the St. Roque channel the flood sets to the south, and the ebb to the north, at about one mile an hour. The establishment of the whole eastern shore of Brazil varies but little as the coast lies nearly in a straight line, and parallel to the tidal wave which traverses the Atlantic ocean from E. S. E. to W.N.W. It is high water, full and change, at Bahia, at 4h. 26m., and the spring rise is 8 feet. The flood runs 5 hours to the north-ward, and the ebb i hours to the south-ward. The velocity of the tide is about it miles an hour, increasing to 2t and 3 miles during springs. It is high water, full and change, at Caravellas, at 4h. 15m., spring rise about 10 feet. The tidal stream varies from 2 to 3 knots, the flood sets to the south, and the ebb to the north, outside the bar; but this direction varies very much with the locality, and force and direction of the wind. It is high water, full and change, at Rio de] aneiro at 3h.; springs rise 4 feet and neaps 3 feet. The usual rate of the tide is about three-quarters of a mile an hour, springs run 1 ! miles. It is high water, {ull and change, ofT Estrella bay at oh. 3om.; springs rise 5 feet, and neaps 4 feet and at Parati 1h. 43m., springs rises! feet. There is little or no stream. Santos Harbor: It is high water, full a'nd change, at 2h. ,som., springs rise 5 feet. The tides are strong, particularly the ebb. It is high water, full and change, at Sao Francisco at 2h. 3om. a. m.; springs rise 7 feet, and 'tlcaps 5 feet. At springs, the stream from the river runs from 3 to 4 miles an hour, and is only overcome by the strength of the flood, soon after resuming its course; this is called half tides (meias mares). It is high water, full and change, at Anhatomirim islet at about 2h. 45m.; springs rise 6 feet and neaps 4t feet. The tides are tolerably regular in Santa Catherina channel; they enter from the northward and southward at the same time, and meet off the town, where they also separate. l'he strength seldo111 exceeds a third of a mile an hour, but near springs it sometimes runs 11 miles. There are no appreciable tides in Maldonado bay.

Monte Video: It is high water, full and change, at 2h. 3om. (approx.); astronomical tides range about 18 inches. Rio de la Plata: In the vicinity of the Cuirassier and Chico light vessels in ordinary weather, the average rise and fall is 4 feet, the ebb setting to the southeast at the rate of from one-half to 3 miles an hour, and the flood to the north-west at from one-half to 1~ miles· an hour. It is high water, full and change, off Andres head at 10h., rise 8 feet. The flood sets to the northward and the ebb to the S01,lthward. It is high water, full and change, in El Rincon about 5h. The tidal streams set strongly, the flood to the north, the ebb to the south, ,nearly 6 hours each way; off Asuncion point the flood sets to the eastward. It is high water, full and change, in Union. bay at 3h. 10m.; springs rise 12 feet, neaps 9 feet. The flood-tide at the entrance sets to the northward across the banks about 2 miles an hour. Rubia Head: The tides run along this coast with dangerous strength, from 2 to 4 miles an hour. Rio Negro: It is high water, full and change, on the bar, during settled weather, at 11h.; springs rise 14 feet, neaps 10 feet. In the offing, it is 3 hours later. The tidal stream· runs parallel to the coast from 2 to 4 miles an hour. The tidal wave comes up the coast from the southward, and rushes round Valdes peninsula with much strength, causing violent and dangerous overfalls off Valdes creek and Norte point. Part of the body of water thus going northward, separates, and r'uns round Norte point; thence to the port of· San Josef the tide sets strongly, with ripplings and races, dangerous for boats, or very small vessels. The main body continues its progress to the northward, inclining to the west, until near Belen bluff, when it divides; one stream running to the north-west, the other to the eastward. Eastward of Belen bluff, the ebb sets faintly to the south or south-eastward; westward of the bluff it sets to the southeastward. West of the meridian of Norte point, the south point of entrance to the gulf of San Matias, and northward of latitude 41° 50' S. 1 but little stream of tide is felt; though the water rises 24 feet. With a weather tide there is a very cross short sea in the entrance of the gulf. Between Villarino point and the Reparo bank the tide runs from 3 to 5 miles an hour. It is high water, full and change, within port San Josef at 10h. om. The tide rises from 20 to 30 feet, and the stream rushes between the-heads from 3 to 5 miles an hour. It is high water, full and change, at port Melo at 3h. 4om., springs rise 15 feet. The tides off this part of the coast are strong, running along the land at the rate of 2 or 3 miles an hour. Off the projecting points, and in confined passages, their strength is of course increased, and causes heavy ripplings wHen opposed to the wind. At full and change, the flood or northerly tide ceases in the offing about 4h. 15m., but near cape Blanco and among the shoals, the tides may be less regular; they produce strong ripplings and set from 3 to 4 miles an hour round cape Three Points. ll is high water, full and change, at port Desire at oh. 10m., springs rise 181 feet. The tides set in and out of the port with regularity, and at the rate of 5 knots an hour. It is high water, full and change, in Sea Bear bay at oh. 45m., rise 20 feet. The tide off the entrance is very rapid. The flood sets to the N. N. E., and has been observed as much as 3 knots against a strong northerly wind. 'fhe ebb sets nearly in the opposite direction and about the same rate. Off Penguin island the northerly stream ceases at about 4 hours after high water by the shore. It is high water, full and change, in the river Santa Cruz, at 9h. 3om.; springs rise 40 feet, neaps rise 29 feet, with a velocity of from 3 to 6 miles an hour. In the offing the tides flow regularly 6 hours each way, but turn 2 hours later than the time of high water in-shore. The flood runs to the north-east ward and the ebb to the south-westward. It is high water, full and change, in the entrance of port Gallegos at Sh. 5om.; springs rise 46 feet, the stream runs at the rate of s miles an hour. · General description: Along that dreary and almost unbroken coast, e.xtending from cape Corrientcs to Bahia Blanca, the stream of the tide is very weak, although the water rises and falls about 10 feet. The great tidal wave from the southward here appears to end, after s'\·eeping along the southern half of South America. In the archipelago of Tierra del Fuego the flood-tide comes from the N. W., passes round cape Horn, and through the strait of Le Maire, and then, from cape St. John, sets strongly

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907. to the eastward and north-eastward. From thence the flood runs to the north-cast, along the north side of Staten island and Tierra de! Fucgo, occasions very high tides at the entrance of Magellan strait, where it unites with the stream which has come directly through the strait, and passing onward along the coast of Patagonia, produces high water at each place in succession until it is lost near cape Corricnies. Near the coast between the dangerous banks of San Illas and Bahia Blanca, the flood and ebb streams set nearly north and !lQUth, from one to 4 miles an hour, according to the wind and the age of the moon. Between the banks of San Blas and the Rio Negro, the tides are regular, running a little more than 6 hours each way, if not affected by the wind, with a velocity of 2 to s miles an hour; these strong and dangerous tides are not much felt at the distance of 15 miles from the land. Between San Blas and cape llermeja the tidal stream sets N.E. and S. \V., about equally strong each way. In the depth of the gulf of San Matais there is very little stream of tide, but a rise and fall of from 20 to 30 feet. In the gulf of St. George there is not much stream of tide. Off capes Dos Bahias and Rlanco, particularly the latter, the tides arc again strong, and there are races off cape lllanco almost as dangerous as those off the peninsula of San Josef. Off the peninsula of San Josef there are dangerous tidal races; and so high and so violent are the waves at particular times of tide that a small vessel might be most seriously injured if not totally destroyed by getting into them. East Falkland Island: The flood runs to the north-east, past the Wolf rock, and becomes stronger as it approaches cape Pembroke, round which its rate is from 2 to 3 miles, according to the age of the moon. The flood runs directly to the northward of the Seal rocks to Volunteer point, while very little tide is felt within the heads of port William or Berkeley sound. The ebb runs with equal strength to the southward, and when there is a strong breeze, a heavy tide rip extends 2 miles off shore. The tide sets to the westward during the flood along the whole south shore of East Falkland; its strength is from one to 2 miles an hour, but near Porpoise point, the south-west horn of the bay of Harbours, it is nearly 3 miles, and with westerly gales forms a strong race. The stream turns when it is high water by the shore. It is high water, full and change, on the shore at Race point, at the northern entrance of Falkland sound, at 6h. 45m.; the velocity of the tide here is about 4 miles an hour, but in Grantham sound its rate diminishes to about 1 ! miles. At the southern entrance of the sound it is high water, full and change, at 7h. The time of high water, full and change, in the harbors in Falkland sound, is given on the chart. The tides in both entrances of the sound, and between the islands, run from 3 to 5·knots at springs, but in the wider portions they arc moderate. The stream of tide at the north entrance makes into the sound about 3 hours before high water on the shore, or about 4 hours at full and change. Among the islands in the south-eastern part of the sound the tides arc very irregular in their set and velocity. There appears to be tide and half tide all through Falkland sound. The flood stream commences by running to the northward when it is half ebb by tire shore, and runs until half flood; it then turns and runs to the southward until it is half ebb again. But the tides among these islands require further investigation; Captain Fitz-Roy states that the tide flows into both ends of Falkland sound, and that the two streams meet near the Swan island. It is high water, full and change, in Pebble sound at Sh. 45~1.; springs rise 8 feet. Running along the north coast of the islands to the westward, part of the flood rushes through Tamar and Wha\er passes, and part sweeps round the West Pebble islet into Keppel sound, filling that sound, and port Egmont, 2 hours before it has ceased running to the westward. This latter portion rushes eastward through the North-west pass at the rate of 5 to 8 miles an hour; it sweeps through a part of Pebble sound, meeting the flood-tide that comes in with equal velocity through Tamar pass, and thus causes whirls and eddies in several quarters. The water having attained its height remains quiet only a ·little while, and then ebbs with similar fury. Biscoe Islands: From the observations which have been made, it is inferred that the flood and ebb streams in moderate weather run eastward and westward for a distance of about 6 miles from the outer points of the land, taking the sweep of the bays.

Paranahyba River: 'fhe tides run at the rate of 4 ors miles an hour in the passage; outside the bar the ebb sets to the northward. Within 3 or 4 miles of Santa Anna reefs the tidal influence from Rio Preha is felt, the flood sets to the south-west and the ebb north-east. It is high water, full and change, at 5h. 45m, rise on the reefs 13 feet. It is high water, full and change, in San Luiz harbour at the custom-house quay, at 7h. om.; springs rise 16; feet, and neaps IOt feet. At the anchorage outside the harbour, the flood sets S.S. W. and the ebb N.N.E. It is high water, full and change, at Manoel Luiz reef, at 5h.; and the rise is 12 feet. The tide runs regularly six hours each way, the flood to the S. \V., and the ebb to the N.E., one mile an hour. From Maranham to the Para River: The flood tide generally runs S. \V. near the coast and W.S. \V., or more westerly, at some distance from it; it has a mean rate of 2; miles an hour near the land, which diminishes as the distance from the coast increases. The ebb tide sets about E.N.E. near the coast at the rate of 1 t miles an hour. From the Para to Cape North: The flood tide, which runs to the S.S. \V. near the mouth of the Amazon, inclines toward the S. W. and \V .S. W. in proportion to the distance from the land; and the ebb tide, which sets first N.E., inclines toward the N. and N.W. before it is united with the general current. A difference of 2 or 3 hours in the establishment of two places far from land and only 12 miles apart, and a rise of only 6; feet 12 miles from a point, where at the preceding tide 29 feet had been observed, are two anomalies in the tides quoted as most remarkable among others less striking, though numerous on this coast. The Bore or Pororoca is a tidal phenomenon which sometimes occurs in the western branch of the Amazon at about spring tides. Tile bore confines itself to the shallows and affiuents, and is not felt in depths over 4 fathoms, except by an increase in the velocity of the stream, so that there is no danger to vessels keeping the main or deep channels. When it makes its appearance, which is at the lowest of the tide, a roaring sound is heard at a distance of from 3 to 6 miles; as it approaches the noise increases, and soon a head of water, estimated to vary from 5 to 12 feet in height with a breaking face, is seen occupying the whole of the shallow water off Maraca island and Araguary river out to about a depth of 4 fathoms. Its velocity is estimated at from IO to 15 miles an hour, being strongest and most dangerous in the months of January to June, and at the equinoxes, when the wind is north-eastward, and it carries away in its course everything that is opposed to it. It.is high water, full and change, at the entrance of Cayenne river at 4h . .>7m. At the equinoxes the rise is IO feet, at ordinary springs 7 feet, and at neaps from 4 to 5 feet. Near the coast the flood stream, combined with the current, sets north-westward with a velocity of 2 to 4 knots an hour, varying with the seasons, being greatest during the summer months; the ebb stream sets north-eastward with a velocity of one knot an hour. The flood stream outside the bar of Maroni river sets north-westward; the ebb stream in the river has a tendency to set towards Dutch bank. Surinam River: In the offing, the flood stream sets to the westward, the ebb to the eastward. It is high water, full and change, at the entrance to Berbice river at 4h. 30111.; springs rise 8 to 10.feet, and neaps 5 to 6 feet. The flood stream in the river sets about S. \\'. and the ebb '.'forth. The flood and ebb streams ofT the mouths of Demerara and Essequibo rivers set S. W. by S. and N.E. by N., respectively, and extend to the distance of about 20 miles from the land, or to a depth of about IO fathoms, on the inner edge. of the permanent north-westerly current. The flood stream at this distance runs with and somewhat increases the strength oi the current, wij_ilst the ebb retards it. \Vaini or Guayma River: The flood stream sets south-westward across the entrance, and the ebb straight out of the river. Orinoco River: The tidal streams for a short distance off the land run about 6 hours each way, the flood to the westward.

Le Maire Strait: It is high water, full and change, in Good Success bay, at 4h. 3m.; springs rise 6 to 8 feet; it is slack water in Le Maire strait at or near the time of high and low water in Good Success bay. In Le Maire strait the flood stream makes to the northward about one hour after low water, and the ebb to the southward about the same time after high water, and the strength of the stream is from 2 to 4 knots near cape San Diego and from 1 to 3 knots in mid-channel; more or less, according to the wind. In Barbara channel the flood-stream was found to set to seaward, or to the southward, as was also the case in Cockburn channel; but the whole system of tides in this great archipelago requires a careful and patient investigation. To the northward of cape Virgins the streams set north-west and south-cast along the coast; the same will be found on the outer edge and outside the Sarmiento bank. The north-west-going stream, which runs from 3 hours before to 3 hours after high water at cape Virgins, appears to sweep up the eastern shore of Tierra de! Fucgo to the south end of Sar111iento bank, where it divides, one stream running into the strait, while the other continues northward along the outer edge of the bank. In the same way the east-going stream is met coming out of the strait, and turned to the southward, by the stream sweeping down the coast to the south-east, and across the entrance in the same direction. 'fhe seaman must not be deceived by this, which makes the west-going stream on the north end of the bank appear to run out of the strait, while toward the south end it varies with the time of tide. Thus it will be seen that in the vicinity of capes Virgins and Espiritu Santo, it is high water, full and change, between 8h. 3om. and 9h. A. M., while the west-going stream is still running into the strait and to the northward past cape Virgins. 'fhe main stream continues running to the westward at full and change until near noon, though the water is falling everywhere. About noon the direction of the stream changes (there being no appreciable slack water in the channel), and until near 3h. P. M. the water continues falling, while the stream of tide is running to the eastward until after 6 o'clocJ<;. Magellan Strait: It is high water, full and change, in the First narrows at Sh. 57m.; and the strength of the stream is from 5 to 8 knots; there is no slack water. The stream changes 3 hours after high and low water. It is high water, full and change, in Philip bay at 9h. 29m.; springs rise 17 feet. The westerngoing stream makes three hours before high water by the shore and runs till three hours after. It is high water, full and change, in Laredo bay at 11h.; springs rise 7 feet. When to the southward of Laredo bay, the tidal streams arc scarcely felt; but to the northward they are strong, and must be carefully guarded against during the night, or in light winds. It is high water, full and change, at port Famine, at noon; springs rise 6 feet, the ebb setting to the northward, and the flood to the southward. It is high water, full and change, in this part of the strait at 1h. 4om. The rise in port Tamar is 6 feet, and a little less in port Churruca. The flood stream sets to the eastward, and may attain a rate of 1! knots. The flood stream sets to the southward, or to seaward in Cockburn channel, !mt was not found to run with sufficient strength to affect a vessel working through. The rise is 6 or 8 feet at spring tides. In Barbara channel the flood stream was found to set to seaward, or to the southward, as was also the case in Cockburn channel. Guia Narrows: It is high water, full and change, at 12h. om.; springs rise 8 feet. The flood stream in the Narrows runs to the eastward, ebb to the westward, at the rate of 2! to 3! knots an hour at springs. It is high water, full and change, in Brassey pass about noon. At spring tides the streams run through the pass J ! knots per hour; flood to the eastward, and ebb to the westward. It is high water, full and change, in Alert harbor at 12h. 15m.; springs rise 7 feet. No stream is felt. It is high water, full and change, in Trinidad channel about noon; springs rise about 6 feet. The flood-stream runs to the eastward and the ebb to the westward. It is high water, full and change, in Eden harbour, at oh. 15m.; springs rise 6 feet. The flood sets S.S.E., the ebb N.N.W.

Magellan Strait to Cape Tres Montes: High water on most parts of this coast takes place within half an hour on either side of noon, at full and change. The stream i~ inconsiderable, and the rise and fall rarely more than 6 feet. Chonos Archipelago: In the channels which have an east and west direction, the flood sets to the eastward, and ebb to the westward. In those having a north and south direction the flood generally sets to ti1e northward, and ebb to the southward. It is high water, full and change, in Chacao narrows at oh. 5om.; springs rise 16 feet, neaps 7 feet. The strength of the streams between Huapacho and Doria Sebastiana islet is from 3 to 4 knots, and gradually increases in rate until the maximum of 9 knots at springs is attained olT Remolinos point. In Chacao bay an eddy sets in a contrary direction to the stream in the narrows from 1 to 3 knots; the line of separation is that dra.wn from Tres Cruces point to Remolinos point. It is high water, full and change, at port Huite at oh. 55111.; springs rise 20 feet, neaps 13 feet. The flood tide off the port sets to the northward, and strongly at springs. Chatham Island: At Wreck bay springs rise 8l feet. Across the entrance to the bay the flood stream sets N.E. by N. at 1! knots, and the ebb S.W. by S. at 1~ knots an hour. Pedro Gonzales Island, Gulf of Panama: It is high water, full and change, in Perry bay at 3h. 5om.: springs rise 16 feet. The tidal stream is not felt.in the anchorage, but there is a considerable set olT the island, the flood running to the northward, the ebb to the southward, the latter being generally the stronger. It is high water, full and change, in Panama road at 3h. 5om.; springs rise from 15 to 22 feet, neaps from 10 feet to 16 feet. The ebb sets south from one to 1! miles an hour, and is stronger than the flood, which runs to the North-west.

From charts published by the United States Hydrographic Office the following velocities of the tidal currents are obtained: Off Cape San Diego, La Marie Strait, 3 to 4 knots (tide race); off Cape Virgins, 2 knots; First Narrows, Magellan Strait, 5 to 8 knots; Second Narrows, Magellan Strait, 3 to 6 knots; entrance to Nuevo Gulf, 2 knots; east of Valdes Peninsula, 3 knots (overfalls)., The charts indicate, by the absence of arrows, the probably small velocities of the tidal currents along the unbroken coasts against which stationary waves have endings.
88. Pacific Coast of North America.

The Gulf of California has a tide wave stationary in the main. Through passages formed by the islands in the gulf, the currents are very strong. Bet.ween Tiburon Island and the main land the flow is hydraulic, with a velocity of perhaps 7 knots. Off Point Fermin, San Pedro Bay, California, a few current observations indicate that the tidal flow is for the most part along the Californian coast and not perpendicular to it. Moreover, the observed current hour for the western stream is V, which about agrees with the time of northwesterly current in the stationary oscillation, one of whose loops is in the Gulf of Alaska, where the tidal hour is IX (see Fig. 23, Part IV A); that is, the flow along the coast is probably much greater than the flow normal to it due to the South Pacific system (sec. 75, Part IV A). Knowing the time of tide for San Francisco Bay to be about VIII, it follows that time of greatest influx must be about V. Observation shows that this inference is nearly correct. Northeasterly from the city the current is rotary in the counterclockwise sense. This agrees with Airy's rule in such matters; for, observations upon both tides and currents pro~e that the tide wave of the southern branch of the bay is nearly stationary, while considerable progression occurs toward San Pablo Bay. Near the mouth of. Richardson Bay, on the northern side of the strait, the currents are rotary in the opposite sense and for a similar reason. Although not based directly upon observation,

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

there are good reasons for believing that beyond the influence of the bay the tidal streams must flow about parallel to the coast and here have VI for the hour of maximum flood. If San Francisco Bay were only a deep reservoir whose level surface rose and fell with the water outside it would be reasonable to expect that for equal ranges of tide the diurnal velocities through the Golden Gate would be one-half those of the semidiurnal. By comparing the values as K 1/K 1 , 0 1/01 with M2/M 2 it will be seen that for San Francisco the ratio is even less than half. This indicates that more wave motion goes on with reference to the semidiurnal tide than with respect to the diurnal, and this would naturally be expected in so limited body of water as San Francisco Bay. Off the southeastern extremities of Vancouver Island the current has ~" velocity of from 3 to 6 knots. The currents are strong at the entrance to Burrard Inlet. The tidal currents in Seymour Narrows, Discovery Passage, have a velocity of from 4 to 8 knots (see Fig. 32, Part IV A). They are chiefly hydraulic, as can be seen by substituting the tidal hours and ranges taken from Fig. 32, Part IV A, in Table 60, and comparing with the observed times of turning. According to Lieut. Commander E. K. Moore, U.S. Navy, the slack waters in the Narrows occurs 3h 48m after Sitka high water and 3 h 51 m after Sitka low water, in absolute time. The former slack is that preceding the north-going stream; the latter, the south-going. The same authority gives as the time by which slack water in Sergius Narrows precedes the high and low waters at Sitka, 2h oom and 1" 41m, respectively. That currents are also hydraulic in Sergius Narrows and in Clarence Strait, can be seen upon consulting the maps just referred to and substituting the values taken from them in Table 60. The turning of currents soon after the high and low waters in most of the canals of Alaska indicate waves chiefly stationary. Through the narrow passes of the Aleutian Islands the currents are hydraulic. For further details concerning the tidal currents in Alaskan waters, see Pacific Coast Pilot, Alaska, published by the Coast and Geodetic Survey.
89. New Zealand.

The tidal streams (Fig. 6) indicate a species of progressive wave traveling entirely around this group of islands. As has been explained in Part IV A, the origin of this movement is the loop of a stationary wave north of the North Island. The fact that a tide wave progresses through Cook Strait in a northwesterly direction from a region where the mean range is only 4 feet to a region where it is 8, suggests at once the probability of the oscillation in the strait being stationary. From Fig. 40, Part IV B, it is seen that the tidal hour and range for the southeastern entrance to Cook Strait, New Zealand, are IV.4 and 4 feet, while the corresponding quantities for the northwestern entrance are IX.5 and 8 feet. Table 60 gives IX.8 for the hour of greatest southeastward downward slope through the strait. This increased by 3 hours gives XII.8 as the ebb (southeasterly) current,hour. This value agrees fairly with the values given upon B. A. Chart No. 69:;. This chart shows overfalls and heavy tide ripplings in the strait due to the uneven bottom. The flow through Tory Channel is probably hydraulic.

On the eastern coast of North island the flood stream runs to the northward, and the ebb to the southward, at the rate of about one knot per hour: but in Hauraki gulf they take a contrary direction, the flood running south and the ebb north. The body of the flood stream, entering from the southward between cape Barrier and cape Colville, separates about False head on the west side of Great Barrier island, and sweeps round to the southward, filling the Thames and Waitemata rivers through the different channels leading to Auckland. The ebb tide runs from one to 1! knots to the southeast between Great Barrier island and cape Colville, but inshore much stronger. The range of tide in Hauraki gulf is from 4 to 10 feet. In Whangaparaoa passage the tides run from one to 2 knots; in Waiheke channel, half a knot; but from 2 to 3 knots in the adjoining narrow channels. It is high water, full and change, at Long point at 6h. om.; springs rise 5 feet; neaps 4 feet. The tides in Hawke's bay are slack in the bay, but strong in the river mouths. The flood sets inward to the northward, and the ebb to the southward. It is high water, full and change, at port Napier at 6h. 15m.; rise, 3 to 4 feet. The flood stream runs in 1! hours after high water, and at the time of slack has fallen from 1 ! to 2 feet; similarly with the ebb, the water begins to rise 1! hours before the outward stream ceases. In the narrow part of the channel the ebb runs 6 to 7 knots, and from the entrance sets northeastward. In the bay the flood comes in from south-eastward, and the ebb runs out northeastward. It is high water, full and change, in Lambton harbor, port Nicholson, at 4h. 17m., springs rise Jt feet, neaps 3t feet; the strength of tide in the Narrows at the entrance of the port, is from half a knot to 2 knots, but within it is much less. The flood stream outside the entrance sets to the northward, and the ebb to the southward; each tide runs about six hours. It is high water by the shore at the southern entrance of Cook strait at 6h. om.; but the flood or northerly stream commences at 3h. om., or three hours before, and runs until three hours after high water by the shore. The narrowest part of Cook strait is formed by cape Terawhiti and Wellington head, the latter bearing from the former N. 80° W. 12 miles. It is high water, in the center of the strait here, on full and change days at Sh. om.; the flood or northerly stream commences at 4h. om. and runs until 1oh. om., the strength of the tide varying from one to 3! knots. Heavy tide ripplings arc experienced in the central part of the strait between these two heads, where there is uneven bottom, the depths varying from 80 to 122 fathoms sand. Tide ripplings also extend ofT cape Terawhiti 2 miles, and for nearly 3 miles off Karori rock; eastward of Sinclair head these ripplings cease. \Vanganui Heads: OfT the adjacent coast the flood runs to the northward, and the ebb to the southward, from 1 to 2 knots. Between Vlanganui and cape Egmont the flood tide sets to the westward, and the ebb to the eastward, at a rate of from one to 2 knots per hour. It is high water, full and change, at New Plymouth at 9h. 3om.; springs rise 12 feet, and neaps 9 feet. The flood sets to the westward, the ebb to the eastward about one knot. It is high water, full and change, at the cast entrance of Tory channel at Sh. 15111.; springs rise 8 feet and neaps 6 feet. At the eastern entrance to the channel the tidal streams run 5 to 7 knots, opposite Jackson bay 2 to 4 knots, and in the rest of the channel one to 3 knots. The flood stream begins to run at 1~h. after low water by the shore, and continues for 5h. 35m.; the ebb stream begins at 1 ~h. after high water, and runs 6h. 25m. QfT Stephens island it is high water at 8h. om.; the flood or north-westerly stream begins 3l hours after low water; and the ebb or south-easterly 3t hours after high water. French Pass: It is high water, full and change, at 10h. om.; the rise is 5 to 12 feet. The tide streams in French pass run 5 to 7 knots, and instead of setting directly through the narrow channel, set across more in a line from Rock Cod point to Channel point, and the contrary, and a tidal irregularity which though not of rare occurrence is especially remarkable in this pass, viz., that the ebb stream runn°ing to the eastward commences at 2 hours before high water by the shore, the tide at the same time rising in

Current basin and French pass; the extraordinary nature of the bottom, in connection with the narrowness of the channel, is quite sufficient to account for the whirling of the current, the depth varying from 7 to 53 fathoms, without reference to the distance from the shore or rocks. Kaipara Harbor: The tides outside the harbor follow the direction of the coast, the flood running south and the ebb north. Manukau Harbor: Tidal streams above Puponga, both in the Wairopa and Waiuku channels, average 2! knots at springs. In the narrow part of the channel off Paratutai they run 4 knots, and on the bar outside from one to 2 knots; on the outer coast the flood sets to the south and the ebb to the north. It is high water, full and change, on the· bar of Whaingaroa harbor at 9h. 5om.; springs rise 12 feet, neaps 9 feet. The strength of the tides between the heads is from 4 to 6 knots; a mile above, from 2t to 3 knots; and at the anchorage off Matakokako point from 1 ! to 2 knots. Newhaven Harbor: It is high water, full and change, at 2h. 3om.; springs rise 7 feet, neaps 5! feet, strength of tide 2 to 3 knots, both ebb and flood. The flood stream runs in for 50 minutes after high water. The flood tide sets through Foveaux strait from west to east, and is strongest between Bluff harbour and Rua puke island; its influence is felt as far as Long point, 45 miles eastward of that island. Between Ruapuke and Stewart island it sets to the south-eastward, running parallel with the shores of the latter. The ebb takes an exactly contrary direction. ft is high water, full and change, in the western entrance of Foveaux strait, that is, between the north point of Stewart island and Pahia point, at 12h. I 5m.; the flood stream commencing from half an hour to 2 hours after low water, according to the winds, being earlier with those from the westward. Both the ebb and flood streams run for 6 hours. At the eastern entrance of the strait, it is high water at 1h. om.; the flood stream commencing at roh. om., or 3 hours after low water. Along the northeast side of Stewart island the flood or south-easterly stream runs one hou_r and 20 minutes after it is high water at port William, or until 2h. om., on fall and change days. The strength of the tide varies from one half to 2! knots; in the narrow part of the strait, between Ruapuke and the Bluff, it is 3 knots. The flood tide coming from southward strikes the south end of Stewart island and divides, one part running northward al~ng its western side, and then eastward through Foveaux strait; the other runs north-east along the south-east side of the island, as far as port Adventure, where the streams meet again and ·flow eastward. The strength of the tides off the coast is from one half to 1 ! knots, except in the narrow passages .. Chatham Island: Tidal streams are felt over an area of from 10 to 15 miles from the islands. The flood splits at the south point and runs north along the east and west sides, to join again at the north end; similarly the ebb divides at the north and rejoins off the south end. A single tide has heen known to take a sailing vessel from off the southeast point of Chatham island into the vicinity of The Sisters. Auckland Islands: The tide-rips off the north point of Enderby island extend a long way to the north-east, at times to a distance of 12 miles, and lo a stranger have a most alarming appearance. The flood sets north-north-east and the ebb to the southward.

9r. Coasts of Australia.

The tidal currents along the eastern coast of Australia are, as a rule, not strong. Those within the Great Barrier Reef seem, from the nature of the case, to be of no great importance in connection with the general problem of ocean tides; but any observed facts relating to the outer edge of the reef, or to the outlying islands must be of value. These indicate that the tides of the Coral Sea belong to a dependent wave nearly stationary in character. Through Torres Strait the tidal streams are considerable. Near the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria the semidaily tide nearly disappears. The easterly and southeasterly direction of the tidal streams northwest of Australia indicate the stationary character of the tide. In the comparatively shallow waters bordering this coast, the currents sometimes have a rotary character.

CURRENTS, SHALLOW-WATER TIDES, ETC.

There is probably little current along the western coast of Australia betweell Houtmann Rocks and Geographe Bay. 1'he current is probably small in the Great Bight. Near the heads of Spencer Gulf and of the Gulf of St. Vincent the currents are weak and irregular, as is usually the case at the end of a stationary dependent wave. On the southwestern coast of Tasmania the streams are weak, indicating a partial end boundary of the oceanic stationary oscillation from the southwest. In the western end of Bass Strait the currents are strong (see Fig. 34, Part IV A). The following quotations are taken from the Australian Directory, Vols. I (1897), II (1898), and III (~895):

It is high water at St. Paul island, full and change, at 11h. om., springs rise 3 feet. At the outer anchora# in 30 fathoms, with Ninepin rock bearing \V.N. \\'., distant 8 cables, the stream sets '.'11.\\T. from low water to 2 hours ebb on the shore, or for 8 hours;.and sets S.E. from 2 hours ebb until low water. Cape Arid: The tides are very weak and inconsiderable in this neighborhood, and are much influenced by the wind. Coffin Bay: At the bar the streams make an hour after low and high water, respectively. It is high water, full and change, in Boston bay at 1h. 5om.; springs rise 6 feet. There is very little tidal stream in any part of port Lincoln. At 2 or 3 miles off the coast outside, the stream sets to the northward during the rising tide, and to the southward during the falling tide, its greatest strength being from 1~ to 2 knots an hour. Spencer Gulf: It is high water, full and change, at the entrance to Franklin harbour at 4h. om.; springs rise 5 feet 6 inches. The streams begin a few minutes after high and low water respectively. It is high water, full and change, in port Victoria, at 2h. 4om.; springs rise 5 feet. The tidal streams set North and South; about 1t knots to the northward during the rising tide. The stream sets N.N.E. during the rising tide, and S.S. \V. during the falling tide, at the rate of 2 knots an hour over Tipara reef; outside it the streams set more North and South. The stream divides off cape Spencer during the rising tide, one branch setting along shore, E.!\" .E., and the other to the north-westward and northward. The tides· in the northern part of Spencer gulf are very irregular. Investigator Strait: During the rising tide the stream sets N.N.E. 1!t miles an hour into Foul bay; and during the falling tide it sets S. W. Kangaroo Island: '!'he north-going tidal stream runs during the rising, and the south-going during the falling tide. It is high water, full and change, in port Wakefield, at 4h. 4om.; springs rise 1 1 feet; neaps s to 6 feet. On the bar at the sea mouth of the Murray river high tide occurs in the night or morning from September to March; and from March to September in the day or afternoon. Also the time of high water only varies 2 hours from the time observed on full and change days (oh. 5om.), ranging from 11 h. when the moon's age is 10 or 26 days; to 3h. when the moon's age is 20 or 7 days. In the Murray mouth the ebb tidal str~am runs strongest at low water, the ordinary rate then being 3 knots on the surface in the deep part, and 4 knots on the bar. There is no tidal stream in Lacepede bay. It is high water, full and change, at all places on this coast at nearly the same time, namely, Portland bay, oh. 3om.; port Fairy, oh. 31111.; \Varrnambool, oh. 37m.; New Year islands (King island), oh. 48m.; Surprise bay (south part of King island), oh. 43m.; Sea Elephant bay (King island), oh. 5om.; springs rise 3 feet. The tides and tidal streams are m).lch affected by the winds and arc uncertain. It is high water, full and change, at New Year islands at oh. 48m.; springs rise 3 feet. The stream turns, in fine weather, at high or low water, but iS greatly affected by prevailing winds.

It is high water, full and change, in Sea Elephant bay at oh. 5om.; springs rise 3 feet. TJ1e flood stream runs to the northward and the ebb to the southward, at sprin~s 1 t knots. Port Phillip: The streams turn from 2 to 3 hours after high and low water on the shore. The in-going stream comes from the southward and eastward, increases in strength as it nears the heads, sets right into the entrance, across and through the reefs, with great force, and spreads toward Shortland bluff and point King. · Between the heads the stream runs from 5 to 7 knots; in the \Vest and South channels between 2 and 3 knots; and about 1 t knots in the broad space above the channels. At the eastern part of the fairway o[ Bass strait, the flood stream sets to the southwest and the ebb to the northeast. Kent Group: The flood stream con;es from the N.E., the ebb from the S.W. Jn fine weather it is slack water at the time of high and low water. At the eastern entrance of Franklin sound the flood streams meet, one coming from the N.N.E. and the other from S.E. The flood stream sets to the westward through Franklin sound, and from thence about W.N. W. on the north side, and W.S. W. on the south side of Chappell islands; and the ebb in the contrary direction. In the north channel the streams run 2 to 2t knots. · Banks Strait: The flood stream is the west-going stream, and the ebb the east-going; the streams are each of 6t hours duration at springs; but during neaps the flood runs 7 hours and the ebb st hours. The interval of slack water never exceeds a quarter of an hour; the west-going stream begins 30 minutes after low water at springs, and 50 minutes after it at neaps; the east-going stream begins 40 minutes after high water at springs, and JO minutes bef6re it at neaps. · In the narrowest part of the strait (St miles wide) between Swan i~les and Clarke island, the tidal streams run at the rate of 3 knots at springs; westerly winds accelerate the east-going stream, which occasionally attains a rate of 5 to 6 knots. The tidal streams are strong at port Frederick, attaining a rate of 5 to 6 knots an hour both with the flood and ebb. Outside the port, the flood is the west-going stream; it is not felt beyond 5 miles from the coast. Tidal streams set through midchannel between King island and Hunter group from one to 3 knots the flood to the north-east, and the ebb to the south-west. · It is high water, full and change, at cape Grim at JOh. 3om.; springs rise S feet; the srmth-westgoing stream has a rate at springs of 5 knots, and at neaps of 3 knots. · Macquarie Harbor: There is little or no tidal stream in Pine cove, and the rise and fall does not usually exceed 1 t feet. The tidal streams are weak and practically imperceptible, but after a heavy gale from the southwest a distinct set was felt into Frederick Henry bay, and in Flinders channel toward Norfolk bay. In the Lachlan channels the flood stream runs to the north, the ebb to the south. Swain Reefs: Jn the offing, 20 miles eastward from Hixson cay, the ebb sets East three-quarters of a knot, and the flood West one knot, the stream turning later than low water, and earlier than high water, on the reef. At Claremont light-vessel the streams set, generally, to the south-westward during the rising tide and to the northward with the falling tide. North of cape Sidmouth the flood runs to the northward, and the ebb to the southward. It is high water, full and change, at Hannibal islands, at 9h. 5om. springs rise JO to 12 feet, neaps 9 to 10 feet; neap range 6 feet. The flood stream sets north and the ebb south, but the result during the strength of the south-east trade or north-west monsoon, is generally to increase or diminish the prevailing current. The flood begins 4 or 5 hours before high water, and the ebb one to 2 hours after high water. Tern Island: The tidal streams generally run parallel to the coast, flood to the northward, ebb to the southward. It is high water, full and change, at Frederick point at 11h. om.; mean springs rise JO feet, mean neaps rise st feet, and neaps range 6t feet. The diurnal inequality, amounting at times to 4 feet, chiefly affects the high waters. The streams are rapid in Albany pass, attaining at springs a velocity of 5 knots an hour, and cause a confused sea when running in an opposite direction to the wind.

Off Fly point 'there is always a very heavy tide rip, dangerous to boats, on the flood at springs, caused by the stream from Newcastle bay meeting the stream on the east side of Ulfra rock. The north-going stream runs until about 2 hours after high water by the shore, and the southgoing stream until about 1, hours after low water. In Adolphus channel the flood stream sets north-westward and ebb south-eastward, both attaining a velocity of from 2 to 4 knots at springs. <.1 The channel is covered with ripplings and swirls when 'the streams are at their strength, giving the appearance of shoal water, but :\lid and Quetta rocks \Vere the only dangers found. The flood sets westward past :\fount Adolphus islands, and meeting the stream through Adolphus channel causes heavy overfalls off the salient points. The streams attain great velocity at springs among the islands of the group. Off Albany rock there is a heavy confused sea when the streams nm strong. It is high water, full and change, at Raine island at Sh. 10m., and the flood runs an hour and three-quarters later in the stream; springs rise 10 feet. The strength of the stream sometimes exceeds 2 knots, the flood coming from the eastward. It is high water, full and change, at Possession island at 1h.; the rise at springs being 9, feet; the flood sets 7 hours S. 22° W., and the ebb 5 hours N. 22° E. In Normanby sound and Thursday island harbour the flood stream sets to the westward, and the ebb to tlie eastward, the flood being strongest during the south-east trade. In Normanby sound the streams run 3 to 5 knots in the direction of the channel. Between Vivien point and Prince of Wales island, both streams at times run 7 knots, but are less felt when Vivien point bears westward of N. 45° W. On the north side of Thursday island harbour, the flood to the westward is from one to 3 knots, but with the ebb there is slack water. On the south side of the harbor the flood runs 2 to 4 knots, and the ebb along the edge of Madge reefs will sometimes reach 4 to 5 knots. The tide sets over Hovell rock with considerable strength. In Flinders passage the tides run 3 to 5 knots, and cause overfalls between Horn island and Tuesday islets. · It is high water, full and change at Murray islands at 9h. 3om.; springs rise 10 feet. Close northward of the islands, the flood sets to the westward, and the ebb to the eastward, about 2 knots at springs. Between Ma~r and the two islets the tidal streams run with great force. In the neighbourhood of Bramble cay, and in the south part of Bligh entrance, the flood runs in a westerly and the ebb in an easterly direction, knots at springs; the flood runs 2 hours after high water. The neap tides are comparatively little, both in range and velocity. The time of high water, full and change, does not appear to differ more than 1! hours throughout the whole length of the' Great Barrier reefs, the average time of high water being at about 9h. ism., and the rise of tide from 6 to 12 feet. At Swain reefs the general direction of the flood through the reefs was found to be south-west, and the ebb to the north-eastward, the velocity between springs and neaps being from 1, to 2 knots; but the stream appeared to run with greater strength through the more confined channels. Between Swain reefs and Lizard island the flood appeared to run in, and the ebb out, through the openings of the reefs, with a strength depending in great measure upon the breadth of the passage. · From Lizard island to lat. 12° 30' or 1:> 0 S., the strength of the stream being confined to the openings, the velocity is increased or diminished according to the width of the chan11el. From lat. 12° 30' S. to Pandora entrance, in lat. r 1° 26' S., the velocity at springs increases to and .3 knots, with a regular ebb and flow, except that the flood appeared to continue half an hour longer than the ebb. At Raine island it is high water at Sh. 10111., the rise being 10 feet at springs; and it is In this vicinity that the strength of the stream increases materially. The flood rushes in through the smaller channels with great velocity; and a well-found merchant vessel, under full sail with a fair wind, has been barely able to effect an entrance against the strength of the ebb near Stead ,passage (in lat. 11° 55' S.). The neap tides are comparatively weak; a reference to the phases of tl1e moon therefore becomes a question of importance when navigating near this part of the Great Barrier reefs.

From Pandora entrance (in lat. 11° 26' S.) to the north-west extremity of the reefs, the sea being more confmed between the coasts of Australia and New Guinea, the streams run with still greater velocity than further southward, the flood having been known to run 5 knots through Yule entrance (in lat. 10° 23' S.). Such a stream alone should deter a sailing-vessel from attempting to effect an entrance through any of the narrow gaps in this part of the barrier; but the strength of the stream , diminishes very considerablyui.s the distance from the reef is increased. Gulf of Carpentaria: It was high water at the entrance of Van Diemen inlet, full and ~hange, at 6h. 45m.; hut in the upper part, the tides were :it hours later. The duration of both tidal streams was 12 hours, and the direction of the rising stream from the northward, following the trend of the eastern shore of the gulf. It is high water, full and change, at Norman river, at 7h. 30111. p. m. in January, and at 7h. 3om. a. m. in July, and are two hours earlier each successive month. There is only one tide in 24 hours. llurketown: The rise and fall at springs is from 9 to 13 feet, and at neaps from 3 to 8 feet-the ebb running to the north-west, the flood to the south-south-east. It is high water in Investigator road, full and change, at 8h. a. m.; springs rise 9 feet, but the neaps arc very irregular. The stream of rising tide sets to the southward, and the falling tide to the northward, from one to 2 knots at springs. The north-going stream makes from 11 to 21 hours before high water. It is high water at llountiful isles, full and change, at 7h. 45m.; the stream of rising tide sets south-westward at the rate of 2 knots. Tidal streams run at times at the rate of 4 knots through Brown strait; that of the rising tide sets to the southward. It is high water, full and change, at the Goulburn islands, at 6h., springs rise 6 feet; in the channels, the stream of rising tide sets to the eastward. It is high water, full and change, in port Cockburn, at 5h. 45m.; springs rise about 14 feet. The streams run with a velocity of 2 to 4 knots in Apsley strait; the flood comes from the northward. Baudin Island: The stream of rising tide sets to the south and west and begins about 20 minutes before low water. The stream of falling tide runs to the north and east, and begins to set 2 hours before high water. It is high water, full and change, at the Montgomery isles, at noon; springs rise 36 feet; the flood stream sets to the southward, at the rate of 2 to 3~ knots near the shore, and in the approach to Doubtful bay. The streams run with a velocity of 7 to 8 knots through Sunday strait and the narrow channels in the entrance of King sound, and in the very narrow portions possibly stronger. In the fairway of the sound its rate is about 5 knots; near the western shore from 6 to 7 knots; and abreast Torment point approach to Fitz Roy river from 3 to 4 knots. Two of the boats of H. M. S. Beagle were nearly ·swamped in the entrance of Fitz Roy river, by the flood rushing in as a tidal bore, several feet in height. King Sound: It is high water, full and change, in port Usborne, at th. 45111.; springs rise 34 feet. The tidal st ream is scarcely felt. Ashmore Reef: It is high water, full and change, at \Vest islet between wh. and 11h.; rise of tide 15 feet. The flood stream sets eastward and the ebb westward. Browse Islet: At Browse islet, springs rise from 13 to 19 feet; neaps range about 4 feet. The tidal streams run strong. 'fhe stream of rising tide sets to the eastward and the falling tide to the westward. It is high water, full and change, at Sandy islet, Scott reef, at about I 1h., rise of tide 13 feet; the stream of rising tide sets to the eastward. It is high water, full and change, at the Lacepedc islands, at about noon; springs rise zo feet. The stream of rising tide at the an.chorage sets south-eastward, and of the falling tide north-westward. Inshore of the Lacepedes the streams set at the rate of from 2 to 3 knots an hour at springs. Eighty Miles Beach: It is high water, full and change, at the northern Turtle isle, at 11h.; spnngs rise 28 feet. The stream of rising tide sets south-eastward at the rate of one to 2 knots. Bedout Island: The stream of rising tide sets to the south-eastward, and of falling tide to the north-westward, rate one to 2 knots. The rise and fall is about 14 feet.

It is,high water, full and change, at Depuch isle, at 10h. 4om.; springs rise 14 feet. At the anchorage the flood sets S. E. by E., and the ebb N.\V. by W. from one to 2 knots. It is high water, full and change, at port Robinson at 11h. 15m.; springs rise 19 feet. The tidal streams are not strong. · It is high water, full and change, in Gascoyne road, at about 10h. Springs rise 5 feet, neaps are irregular. The stream of rising tide sets from East to S.E. and the falling tide N .\V.; rate from one to 2 knots. It is high water, full and change, in Champion bay at 9h.; springs rise d feet, and neaps 1t feet. It is high water, full and change, in \Varnbro sound at 9h.; springs rise 2 feet and neaps it feet; they arc, however, very irregular, being greatly influenced by the. prevailing wind.

93. Eastern Coast of Asia, and the East Indies.

The tidal currents along the eastern coast of Asia resemble in some respects those found along the coasts of Great Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, or those along the northeastern coast of Brazil. Their variety is, however, greater owing to the presence of considerable diurnal tide or inequality in the China Sea and neighboring Waters. Along this coast of Asia there are arms and belts of shallow water in which the tidal currents are in part rotary; there are several large tidal estuaries; the Bore of the Tsien-tang at Hang Chau is far famed; and in most of the rivers the duration of rise is much less than the duration of fall. It will be noticed, from the statements quoted below, that the streams enter Formosa Strait from both ends; that there is a great crowding up of the cotidal lines near Wci-haiwei; that there are strong currents southwest of Kiusiu; and that for the southeastern coast of Japan the flood sets sou.thwesterly, as toward a loop of a stationary wave. Strong currents occur in the passages leading to the Inland Sea. The following are a few quotations taken from the China Sea Directory, Vol. I (1896), Vol. II (1906), Vol. III (1904), Vol. IV (1894), and Eastern Archipelago, I (1890). In regard to the tidal currents around the islands of the Pacific Ocean, fr may be said that the information is very meager. Such as exists may be gathered from the sailing directions for the Pacific Islands Vols. I-III. A good portion of this matter, taken chiefly from Admirfllty charts, is shown on the chart covering this ocean, (Fig. 6). The same chart shows a portion of the currents around the East Indies. On account of the large diurnal wave, the arrows in this region are not always reliable. l\fore detailed matter of a few localities will be found in Van der Stok's book entitled Wind and Weather, Currents, Tides and Tidal Streams in the East Indian Archipelago (1897). Tidal currents for the Philippines are shown upon chart No. 1898, of the Hydrographic Office, United States Navy. One portion of the, flood enters through the Sulu Archipelago. All along the northeastern and northwestern coasts of Borneo the flood stream probably progresses westward (Cf. Figs. 36, 37, Part IV B). Another branch passes through Balintang Channel and continues southward as far as Panay Island. Another branch enters through San Bernardino Strait. Through San Juanico Strait the currents are hydraulic and strong. As some account of the bearing of the tidal streams of the southern coast of Asia upon the tides has been given in sections 80, 81, Part IV A, and section· 30, Part IV B, littl~ will be done here except to refer to Bay of Bengal Pilot, Red Sea and Gulf of Aden' Pilot, and Islands of the Southern Indian Ocean.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

It will be seen from Fig. 5 that the tidal streams in the upper portions of the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are nearly normal to the coast line. The flood arrow at the mouth of the Gulf of Suez pointing southerly on Fig. 5 instead of northerly is in accordance with the explanation of the tides of this gulf given in Parts IV A and IV B. The Bay of Bengal Pilot (1901) saysWithin a few miles of the Nicobars the flood tidal stream generally sets north-eastward and the ebb stream south-westward; the streams attain in the channels between the islands a rate of 3 to 4 knots.

This indicates that here the streams are strong, as if in the vicinity of a nodal line (see Fig. 23, Part IV A).
94. Eastern Coast of Asia, quotations.
Malacca Strait: It is high water, full and change, at Arang Arang, at 7h. approx.; springs rise 10 feet. In the harbour, the flood stream sets to the eastward and the ebb to the westward; but seaward of the 5-fathom bank,' the streams set across the channel; the flood setting south-east ward from 3~ hours before until 2, hours after high water by the shore, and the ebb north-westward. It is high water, full and change, in Malacca road at 7h. 3om.; springs rise I I feet, neaps 8! feet. The tidal streams set S. E. by E. at the rate of 2' knots from 3 hours before to 3 hours after high water at One fathom bank. It is high water, full and change, at Raffies lighthouse, at i 1h., but the stream does not set to the eastward till two hours later, and it is then about half ebb by the shore. 'fhe tidal streams from Malacca strait and from the China sea meet between Tree island and Tanjong Bulus, but no dependence can be placed upon them. The tidal streams in Salat Sinki run with considerable stre'ngth, the flood to the westward and the ebb to the eastward. In Sunda strait, it is high water, full and change, during the north-west monsoon, at 6h.; springs rise 3 feet. The flood sets north-eastward and the ebb wuth-westward with a rate at springs of 3~ knots, but \t should be observed that the tidal streams arc much influenced by the prevailing winds outside the strait, so that as a consequence the set of the stream is mainly south-westward during the greater part of the year. The tidal streams in Banka strait are strong but irregular, and are greatly influenced by the monsoons. The flood stream enters the strait at both ends, meeting near the Nangka islands. Northwest coast of Borneo (lat., 5° 3' N.; long., 115° 12' E.). The flood stream on the Outer bar sets in it hours after low water, and the ebb stream runs out about 1 t hours after high water, the rate at springs being from 2 to 3 knots. To seaward of the bar, the direction of the tidal streams has not been determined. Between the bar and Sa po point, the flood generally sets to the south-west; the ebb to the north-east. J1alabac Strait: The flood stream sets to the eastward and the ebb to the w~stward. The strength of the stream or of the current depends greatly on the prevailing winds. The greatest velocity observed was knots. It is high water, full and change, at Bangkok river bar at 7h. 4om., but this is subject to a large correction, the greater part of which varies with the moon's declination. Outside the bar and near the anchorage the flood sets to the westward, and the ebb to the eastward, altering its direction according to the strength of the river stream. Along the eastern shore of the gulf ,toward cape Liant the cbh sets to the southward and flood to the northward. Tong-King Gulf: It is high water, full and change, at Fai Tsi Long archipelago at about 5 hours. The tidal streams among the islands attain a rate of 2 knots an hour in places where confined; in the offing the streams run from one to 1 ~· knots an hour; the flood coming from the south-west, and the ebb from the north-cast; off Kebao the streams run nearly tide and half tide. ' Hainan Strait: In North channel the flood sets S. \V. by W. from one to 3 knots an hour, and the ebb N .E. by E. from one to 3~ knots.

It is high water, full and change, at \Vest or Fort point, Nau chau, at 10h. 2om.; springs rise 12i feet, neaps 8 feet. At Nau chau the stream runs 2' knots at springs, changing about one hour after high and low water, the flood setting to the southward, and the ebb to the northward. · It is high water, full and change, at Breaker point at 10h. om. appr~ximately; springs rise 8 feet. From January to May, between Hongkong and Breaker point, the ebb tidal stream ran eastward, but generally speaking it was weak. Eastward of Breaker point the flood stream sets eastward. Port Swatau: The flood stream is said to continue for one to hours after high water on the bar. Namoa Island: The flood stream comes in both northward and southward of the island. The ebb tidal stream off J okako point has been observed to set south-w~stward 4! knots in one tide. Amoy: In the Inner harbour the duration of the flood tide is about 71 hours, and of the ebb st hours. The rate of the ebb stream during the first three hours is 4 to 5 knots at springs, and during its latter part 2 to 3 knots; the average rate of the flood stream is 2 to 3 knots at springs. The flood stream runs from three-quarters of an hour before low water to a quarter of an hour after high water. Kwing Bay: In March, ·ofT Tau point, the flood stream sets south-westward and the ebb north-eastward, 2 to 2! knots an hour. The flood stream enters Hai tan strait by both the northern and southern entrances; these streams meet between Rocky and Middle islands, in which vicinity, and more especially between Hill and Middle islands, there are, with strong winds, heavy overfalls, dangerous for boats. Pescadores Islands: Off the Rover group, the north-going or flood stream makes at 4 hours after high water, and the south-going or ebb stream at 2 hours before high water. The rate of the north-going stream in Shogun suido sometimes exceeds4 knots during the strength of the south-west monsoon, while the south-going stream rarely reaches 3 knots, but these rates may be reversed .during the north-east monsoon. At about 3 miles ofT the coast, in the vicinity of 'l'amsui harbour, the ebb tidal stream sets northeastward at 2! to 3. knots an hour. This stream runs round the northern end of Formosa, and causes a turbulent ripple off Syau ki and Foki kaku. The flood stream runs south-westward at 2 knots an hour. Chusan Archipelago: The tidal streams around and between the islands are very rapid, sometimes attaining a rate of 7 and 8 knots; and the tide ripplings are numerous and dangerous for boats when there is much wind. As a rule, the sea does not run high, but the day before the approach of a typhoon, and during its continuance, a heavy swell rolls in upon the rock-bound coast. The direction of the tidal streams eastward of Chang tau is rotary, turning with the hands of a watch; but in the straits between the islands, in the mouth of Hangchau bay, and close to the land, it follows the conformation of .the coast. Clear of local influences, the following is a broad guide: The first half of the flood runs in directions from South to \Vest; the last half from \Vest to ~orth. The first half of the ebb runs from North to East, the last half from East to South. Usually, as the moon crosses the meridian, the bore passes llaining, where it is nearly a straight line across the river, 9 cables wide, 8 tu 11 feet high, and traveling 12 to 13 knots an hour; its front being a uniform sloping cascade of bubbling foam, falling forward and pounding on itself and on the river before it at an angle of between 40° and 70°. 'fhe highest and steepest part is over the deep channel of the river. A quarter of an hour after the bore has passed Raining, the water has risen 13 feet; at 2h. om. it has risen 18 feet; it is high water at ~h. om. when the tide has reached a l1eight of 19 feet, and the stream at once commences to run out swiftly. At 5h. om. it is at the mean level; at 8h. om. it is nearly low water. The out-going stream, however,. continues to run rapidly eastward until the arrival of the next bore. The water is at its lowest for the 2 hours preceding the bore.

GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

It is high water at Rangchau fu about the same time as at Raining, hut the rise and fal! docs not exceed 6 or 7 feet. At Raining the flood lasts for 3 hours; the ebb for 9 hours. At Hangchau fu the flood continues for i1 hours, and is nearly all in the bore. The tidal streams off the mouth of the Yangtse kiang are rotary and turn in a direction with the hands of a watch; the first half of the flood runs in directions from South to West, the last half from \Vest to North; the first half of the ebb runs in directions from North to East, the last half from East to South. The rate of the stream varies with the age of the moon between one and 4 knots an hour. The streams on the south-eastern coast of Shantung, eastward to Staunton ioland, appear to follow the general direction of the coast, the flood stream setting west-south-westward, and the ebb eastnorth-eastward, at an average rate of 11 knots an hour. The times of the high water at various parts of the promontory, from Tsing hai bay to Wei hai wei, alter considerably at short intervals of distance, whilst the tidal streams change almost simultaneously at short intervals of distance. Pe Chili Strait: In Charybdis harbour it is high water, ful! and change, at roh. 3om.; springs rise 9 feet. The tidal stream sets northward in Hope sound and Charybdis harbour during the flood, and southward during the ebb. For some distance eastward of Miau tau strait the flood stream sets westward, and the ebb eastward; but within the strait, a few miles westward of Teng chau, the flood sets eastward and the ebb westward. Northward of the Li tsin ho, the flood sets north-westward along the shore, and the ebb southeastward, turning, but not regularly, at high and low water. At Lan mun sha banks, near the shore, the flood sets southward and the ebb northward. Lian tung Gulf (Sand Point): The flood stream sets northward along the shore, the ebb southeastward; the streams turn earlier near the shore than in the offing. On the east coasts of Kamchatka, Yezo, and Nipon the tidal streams are weak, and no exact observations are available; probably the streams set to the southward with a rising tide, and to the northward with a falling tide. Along the south coast of Japan, the flood stream sets to the westward and the ebb to the eastward. The flood sets northward up the Kii and Bungo channels, the stream from the first channel setting westward in the Seto Uchi, and that from the Bungo channel dividing into two parts, one stream setting westward toward Simonoseki strait, and the other eastward, meeting the Kii channel stream at the east end of Bingo Nada. On the west coast of Kiusiu and in Korea strait the flood stream runs to the northward; to the westward and north-west tlfrough the Korean archipelago, and to the northward along the west coast of Korea. In the Japan sea the tidal streams are weak and irregular. In the gulf of Tartary the flood stream sets to the northward. 'fhroughout the above coasts the streams overrun the rise and fall of tide by about one hour on the open coast, to 2 to 3 hours and even more in the Seto Uchi, among the inner islands, and in confined straits. Amongst the islands off the south coast of Korea the Jlood stream sets to the westward, the ebb to the eastward, turning about 2 hours after high and low water by the shore. The flood stream sets north-eastward along the western shore of the strait of Tartary at the rate of 2 miles an hour. Southwest Japan: 'fhe tides near Kusakaki sima appear regular, flood flowing to the northward and ebb southward. The tides near 11ikomoto are regular, the flood setting \\'.S.W., and the ebb E.N.E. from 1} to 3 miles an hour. It is high water, full and change, in Yokohama bay at 5h. 45111. Springs rise s feet; neaps Jt feet. The tidal stream is scarcely perceptible in Yokohama bay. Near the extreme of Futsu saki the tidal streams sweep round at a rate of more than 3 knots an hour at springs. · The rise in Ofunato harbour is about 5 feet; there is no perceptible tidal stream there. It is high water, full and change, in Fuk ura, eastward of Naruto passage, at 6h. 14m. springs rise 61 feet, neaps 41 feet. At Anaga ura, northward of the passage, the time of high water is variable,

and the rise is 2 to 4 feet. The stream sweeps through the passage with great velocity, and the roar of its breakers can be heard for several miles. The south-going stream begins, at springs, 3 hours and 25 minutes after the moon's meridian passage, and 2 hours and 8 minutes after the moon's meridian passage at neaps. Me sima Group: Strong tidal streams set through the channels between the islands, the flood to the north-west, and the ebb to the south-east; but the general direction of the tidal streams is more to the northward and southward. \Vest coast of Kiusiu: Between Me saki and Noma no hana the flood stream sets to the northward along the coast, and the ebb tide to the southward, attaining at spring tides a velocity of from 2~ to 3 knots an hour. The stream sweeps round the bays, causing tide-rips off the prominent points. lt is high water, full and change, at Nagasaki at Sh. 11p-i.; springs rise 10~ feet, and neaps about 7 feet, but they are variable. La Perouse Strait: The tides set east and west through the strait, the east-going stream attaining at spring tides a velocity of from 4 to s knots an hour.

Eastern Archipelago.
Arru Islands: The flood stream in Dobbo harbour comes in from the westward, and the ehb stream from the eastward. In the south-east monsoon the flood is weak, but the ebb runs from one to· 1~ knots an hour. In the offing the flood stream sets to the S.S.E. and the ebb to the N .N. \V. Dampier Strait: The flood stream sets to \V.S.W. and the ebb to E.N.E., but the streams appear to be greatly affected by the prevailing monsg.ons.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

CHAPTER VII.
TIDAL CURRENTS IN RELATION TO MARINE ENGINEERING.

98. Upon comparing rivers which discharge into inland seas with those discharging into tidal waters, it will at once be noticed that all estuaries belong to the latter class. Bars resulting from the deposit of alluvial matter are frequently found at the mouths of rivers of both classes, but deltas are more characteristic of rivers discharging into bodies of water having small tides. It will be noticed that narrow straits connecting the ocean with bays, harbors, ports, or so-called lakes are frequently much deeper than the near-by waters off either end. Where the water is shallow and the current strong, as at the mouth of an estuary, the material easily moved will arrange itself in ridges extending in the direction of the flood and ebb. For, an obstacle upon the bottom will cause a deposition· on either side of it-on the one side during the flood and upon the other during the ebb. In a somewhat similar manner a cape, around which the current flows, may be extended into a hook, the hook extending toward the inward side protected from the action of the waves; or it may protect, as it were, a narrow shoal. Again, if rocks are scattered over a bottom easily eroded, the eddying effect of the impinging streams will produce an excavation upon either side of the rocks.
99. Tidal rivers.*

The scouring action of the tide goes on more or less at all parts of a river; the eroded matter is, upon the whole, driven seaward because the ebb stream is somewhat stronger than the flood stream owing to its smaller cross section and to the natural discharge of the river. The portion of the river meeting the ocean is often more favorably situated for scour than the other portions owing to the facility with which the eroded matter, much of which is held in suspension, can be dispersed through the action of the waves and currents; hence, the greater depth between the capes. Where the ebb stream loses a large portion of its velocity, matter driven or carried by the water will be deposited. As a ·rule, a bar will thus be formed off the mouth of the river. The.action of the waves will take away the soluble matter, leaving the bar composed mainly of sand and shingle. Tidal currents whose di.rection some distance offshore is that of the general shore line, are of great importance in preventing the formation of a bar. For example, the. rivers discharging into Chesapeake Bay have no bars, because the tidal streams of the bay, although not strong are yet sufficient to drive away any accumulation off the river mouths. Again, the tidal streams of the North Sea prevent the formation of bars off the estuary of the Humber and the Wash. On the other hand, stationary tidal waves in which the particles move to and from the shore permit the formation of bars

and deltas. For example, the Atlantic coast of the Southern States, northwestern coast of Brazil, the coasts of India. (See Figs. 14, 22, 16, Part IV B.) As a rule, bars do not occur as frequently off broad estuaries and bays as off rivers and estuaries of moderate width. The broader the estuary the greater is the dispersive effect of wind waves and littoral currents. On the other hand, an island or shoal lying a short distance offshore and to the right or left of the estuary might cause a bar to be formed, even where the currents along the shore are considerable, because the effect of these currents is much reduced by the intervention of the island or shoal. Similarly for a cape or headland extending outward from the shore. Sand will be driven along the bottom if the velocity there be 04 knot; fine gravel, if about l knot; shingle, about r inch in diameter, if 2.5 knots; angular stones, about l! inches in diameter, if 3.5 knots. The wind waves play an important part by disintegrating the rocks along the shore and driving about beds of sand and gravel lying beneath the shallow waters. Such effects may even close up the mouths of small streams and divert the lower part· of their courses.

roo. On the training of tidal rivers. In training a tidal river so as to aid in the production and maintenance of a good depth, two things are of prime importance: r 0 The elimination of irregularities of shore line and of depth; 2° the conserving of the tidal volume. (r) Irregularities of shore line may be gradually effaced by means of groins extending outward from the banks toward the channel. These may be extended from time to time as the material deposited through their agency accumulates. Finally, when the channel becomes sufficiently regular a permanent wall along either bank, and connecting the extremities of groins, should be constructed. This greatly reduces all minor irregularities which the groins alone would occasion. The river thus brought to a channel having regular banks will exert a scouring effect' upon irregularities of depth. However, on account of the hardness or compactness of the river bed some dredging is generally required. With the river properly trained laterally, the work of dredging is greatly facilitated by the increased scour of the stream. It is evident that a training wall or pier should extend seaward to deep water, otherwise it will act as a groin in impeding the littoral currents and causing a deposit to be formed in the channel near its mouth. Unless the piers are to form a harbor of refuge and a protection for the entrance to the river, they should not converge but rather should diverge in a manner somewhat analogous to the banks of an estuary; for, besides causing swift currents at the outer ends, a too narrow opening greatly impedes the entrance of the tidal wave. This remark does not apply to a basin-like harbor, which is in no sense a tidal estuary. In ·this case the tnotion through the entrance to the harbor will be chiefly hydraulic in character. Converging piers are then advantageous, because the area between them constitutes an addition to the impounded water, and because the narrowness of the entrance enables the tide to there exert a scouring effect in the channel. In some instances one sea wall may be a sufficient protection for the channel. This should be situated upon the side exposed to drift whether resulting from wind

or tide or other current, and should generally be concave toward the protected channel. The outer end of the wall, which should reach deep water, therefore trends in approximately the direction of the movement of the littoral current. Some engineers do not follow this rule of making the jetty concave toward the channel. Sec a paper by T. W. Symons and discussions thereon, in the Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Vol. 36 (1896), pp. 109-138. Where the tide is of little consequence in comparison with the current proper of the stream, parallel walls or jetties are commonly used for deepening the channel by scour and with good results. Such are the jetties constructed by James B. Eads at the outer end of South Pass of the Mississippi Delta. The channel thus narrowed quickly increased in depth. The jetties cause the deposits of the river to be made so far out from the Delta that littoral currents are highly effective in transporting the material elsewhere. ' In some cases no sea wall need be constructed if advantage is taken of the most natural course of the streams through the shallow bay or estuary. The main channel of the stream having been selected, all shallow portions of its bed arc deepened by means of dredging, and the material taken out used as advantageously as possible in building up shoals or closing up undesirable passages. The improvement of the entrance to New York Harbor on a plan proposed by Major (now General) Gillespie is a conspicuous example of this method. (2) The deepening of the channel permits the tide to flow with less resistance, and so the range may be increased in the upper portion of the river. An increased range means an increased tidal volume available for scouring. This often means greater velocity for the water particles. In fact, by (142),

v=r:~t.where r; is the height of the tide above the undisturbed surface-that is, the velocity of the current is directly proportional to the amplitude of the tide and inversely proportional to the square root of the depth. Hence, whether or not the velocity at any section will be increased, depends upon how the amplitude of the tide is affected by the increase in depth. If the river and estuary are so short and so formed that the tide wave is largely stationary, the velocities in some portions may become greatly reduced. The training, deepening, and extension of the tidal river will cause the tidal movement to be propagated with less irregularity and the current to become generally stronger. If, however, it is not possible to extend the tidal river, as would be the case where rocky formations occur near the head of tide water, it becomes especially important to preserve broad flats as tidal reservoirs. Being usually covered with vegetable growth they offer no serious menace to the near-by channels. In some instances artificial tidal reservoirs are used for flushing out channels or harbors.* By means of gates a large volume of water from the reservoir can be made to flow out in a comparatively short time, thereby making the scouring effect considerable. - - - - - - - - - · ·--··------ - - · - - - - - - - - *Thomwi Stevenson: The Design and Construction of Harbors, 3d ed., pp. 301-305.

A lake-like broadening of a tidal river is generally serviceable in maintaining the depths at the portions of the river below it. However, the broadening and s4bsequent contraction should, if possible, be gradual, in order tlik.t no great amount of energy be lost by the change of cross section. The following tidal rivers or estuaries along the coasts of the United States have bars off their mouths: Connecticut River; Hudson River; Winyah Bay; Charleston Harbor; Stone Inlet; North Edisto River; St. Helena Sound; Port Royal Sound; Tybee Roads; Savannah River; Ossabaw Sound; St. Catherine Sound; Sapelo Sound; Doboy Sound; Altamaha Sound; St. Simon Sound; St. Andrews Sound; Cumberland Sound; Nassau Sound; St. Johns River; Mississippi River; Brazos River; Coos Bay; Columbia River; Willapa Bay; Grays Harbor. Nearly all of these bars have been improved by dredging and jetties. The following are a few references to papers and books relating to the improvement of tidal rivers and harbors: D. Stevenson: Canal and River Engineering. E. L. Corthell: A History of the Jetties at the Mouth of the Mississippi River, New York, 1881. Thos.

101. Harbors, bays, or lakes connected with the sea by means of a narrow strait.

Knowing the rise and fall of tide off the outer end of the strait, also the dimensions and depths of the strait and inner body, it is not difficult to ascertain the velocity in the strait at any time, provided that the inner body is sufficiently deep in comparison with its horizontal dimensions for rnmaining sensibly level and the strait is but a small part of a wave-length long. For then the motion will be nearly steady and Bernoulli's theorem with resistance will apply. See sections 104-106, Part IV A, and sections 9, 15-17, Part V.

When the dimensions and depths are such that at any given time the fl.ow through the strait is not practically steady, the problem becomes one of great difficulty, and will not be considered here. In soil which is easily eroded, the swift currents produce and main':ain a deep tideway between the outer and inner bodies. Off the outer end of the strait a bar is generally formed, and in some instances off the inner end also. Dredging is usually required at the bar, and the channel thus· constructed should be protected by jetties against detritus from the neighboring· banks and shoals. The jetties should be parallel or slightly convergent and should extend outward into as deep water as may be practicable, in order that the subsequent dredging may be reduced to a minimum. The action of the waves upon the beach may cause fine matter to become suspended in the outside water. The flood stream thus discolored will, upon passing the strait, deposit this fine material upon the bottom and shores of the quiet inner body.· The ebb stream will be comparatively clear. Thus it is seen that lagoons along the coast may receive sedimentary deposits from the waters outside as well as from the fresh-water streams which may discharge into them. Examples of erosion in straits.-Lake Pontchartrain and the Rigolets passes. The larger pass at one point reaches the extraordinary depth of 95 feet, and the smaller one (Chef Menteur Pass) the depth of 90 feet. A bar covered by from 1 to 6 feet of water lies off the inner ends of the passes. Rockaway Inlet, leading to Jamaica Bay, New York, is at one point 57 feet deep, while the depth across the bar ranges from nothing to 16 feet. The average depth of San Francisco Bay is less than 10 fathoms. At its narrowest portion the depth of the Golden Gate reaches 60 fathoms. A· nearly continuous bar, covered by from 4 to 6 fathoms of water and having a semicircular form, lies to the west of the Golden Gate. The center of the circle is 4.8 miles from Fort Point, and the radius is 2.7 miles. Other examples along the eastern coast of the United States are Robinsons Hole, Massachusetts; Hatteras Inlet; Ocracoke Inlet; inlet opposite Beaufort, N. C.; New River Entrance; Cape Fear River Entrance; Boca Grande; Charlotte Harbor; West Pass, Apalachicola Bay; entrance to Pensacola Bay; entrance to Mobile Bay; Grand Pass, Barataria Bay; South West Pass, Vermilion B~y; entrance, to Galveston Harbor; Pass Cavallo; Aransas Pass; Corpus Christi Pass. All of these inlets have bars outside the capes; in numerous instances they have been improved by dredging and the construction of jetties.

Destructive effects due chiefir to wind waves.

The destructive effects of the waves during severe storms upon an exposed coast line are frequently so great as to cause much alarm in the locality affected, and to

justify the expenditure of large ·sums of nroney in preventing them. The power of waves to tear down land is made far more effective where a littoral current, tidal or otherwise, is sufficiently strong for carrying away much of the matter thus brought into the reach of the sea. Where no such current exists, the tendency to form a protecting shoal along the exposed coast is greatly increased. According to an estimate of Prof. W. M. Davis, all of the mainland of Cape Cod Peninsula north of the bend will be consu.med by the waves in eight or ten thousand years. According to Edward A. Martin, F. G. S., the coast denudation for England has amounted to 41378 acr~s in thirty-three years (1867-1900).
103. The formation or arrangement of shoals.

Through the encroachment of the sea upon the land, particularly noticeable after heavy storms, the near-by waters become discolored by the soluble ingredients of the soil, while the heavier matter remains on the bottom, comparat.ively near to the scene of the erosion. In this manner beds of sand and shingle are formed. Imm~nse quantities of alluvial matter are brought to the shallow waters of the sea through the agency of rivers. Besides forming shoals and bars off the mouths of these streams, as was mentioned in section 98, this material, through the action of the waves and currents, is scattered and transported to near-by localities favorable to the formation of shoals, islands, and shore extensions. It is, however, difficult to say how much of the mate.rial composing the shallow bed of the ocean adjacent to the shore is transported from river mouths and how much is due to the degradation of the coast line. Maps of soundings constitute almost the only guide in this matter. It will be noticed that the alluvium in the littoral waters, which is continually forming shoals and lowlands, is especially abundant in the vicinity of river mouths. The effect of currents becomes conspicuous only where their velocity at the bottom is in excess of 0.3 knot. Shoals thus formed, or at least modified, often appear as ridges whose direction coincides with the lines of flow of the maximum current. Any sunken object may serve as the nucleus of a detached shoal. The sand drivep along the even bottom will be arrested if it come in contact with an object constituting an irregularity in the bottom. Both flood and ebb currents may bring up sand, anti. from both directions. Such shoals occur in the following localities: In the North Sea, especially off Lincoln, Norfolk; in the Thames Estuary; off Belgium and between Holland and Norfolk; southeast of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts; south of Cornfield Point, Connecticut; eastern end of Vineyard Sound; Lower New York Bay; Delaware Bay; off Chincoteague Island; Chesapeake Bay Entrance; Essequibo River; and the Gulf of Cambay. As time goes on, shoals of this kind may rise to the surface and become low, flat islands.. But even before they reach the surface the ordinary action of the wind waves may be to drive the sand higher and higher upon the shoals, and so to facilitate their growth, just as heavy matter is being continually washed ashore. A cape or point sometimes serves to check the motion of the water, and thus aid in the formation of a shoal,-e. g., shoal northeasterly from· Great Point, Nantucket Island; Henand Chickens Shoal, Cape Henlopen; and Hampton Bar, Old Point Comfort.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

104. Littoral drift, deposition, and beach formation.

In driving material along the foreshore, the influence of the flood stream is much greater than that of the ebb, and so, as a rule, determines the prevailing direction of the drift; for, the material available for transportation results from the disintegration of rocks and soil, which process goes on above high-water mark, and is by the ~ction of the destroying waves brought more within reach of the flood stream than within that of the ebb. Littoral drift is frequently due chiefly to the repeated impacts of wine! waves. In fact, stones more than an inch or two in diameter could seldom be moved by tidal currents alone. Moreover there is abundant evidence of such drift in tideless lakes and seas. Wind waves deposit sand and stones upon the sh.ore because the material driven along the bottom beneath the crest of the wave continues to advance as long as the water immediately surrounding it moves shoreward. In this way sand and stones are driven high upon a shelving beach, the kinetic energy possessed by the moving material and surrounding water being consumed or converted into potential energy in the process. The receding wave can not move all of the stony material thus brought in, because energy must be consumed in moving and imparting velocity to it; the returning current is too feeble at and near the highest point reached by the wave to produce the necessary impact. Whether matter is held in suspension or driven along the bottom, deposition will take place whenever the velocity of the water becomes sufficiently reduced. Therefore, if any current follows the shoreline and if groins or piers be extended outward, comparatively still water will be found between the groins; and in the course of time solid matter will .there be deposited. In this way the lines of high and low water may be carried seaward. If a straight sandy coast turns suddenly away from the sea, a sharp point or narrow arm may spring from the angle and take the original direction of the coast, although i~s extreme tip, forming a hook, may be continually directed inland, receiving its direction from the flood tide or incoming waves. The streams along the coast following the general direction of a growing arm can not tum aside immediately upon arriving at its extremity. There comparatively slow streams and even eddies favor the growth of the arm. A hook results when the end of the arm is so rounded off that the flood stream can follow it well and so drive matter inward before losing too much of its velocity. The effect of the ebb is to turn the hook in the opposite direction or outward. Hence, when the rise and fall of tide is great, the effect of the flood (where the tide is progressive) upon the foreshore will exceed that of the ebb and there will result a hook turning inward. But where the rise and fall of the tide is not great (or where the tide is stationary), a slender arm may be extended through shallow water and form a nearly straight beach, although the advancing end will often be turned slightly inward; e.g., Rockaway Beach and Coney Island. When a hook of considerable extent is formed at the end of the arm, the effect will be that of a receding shoreline, and .under some suitable circumstances another and much smaller arm will be formed following the direction of the outer shore of the main arm. This will grow, and finally become hooked. Another slender arm may form an extension of the outer shoreline; and so on. The result will be an arm whose outer shore is nearly straight while the inner shore is indented with bays. Sandy Hook .is an example of this mode

APPENDIX 6.

q_f growth. The deep water east ot this peninsula indicates that the tidal streams in conjunction with the winds are responsible for its origin and growth. But Mitchell says (p. 108, Coast Survey Report, 1873):
The material forming Sandy Hook is swept up from Long Branch coast by the diagonal wash of the sea. This was placed beyond dispute by my observations of 1857. Materials of the same specific weight as the sand were placed in the sea at many different points down the outside shore, and at different distances off shore. Those within the action of the waves breaking near the shore were swept along to the northward, and finally collected at the point of the Hook. Those placed far off shore never came to land, so that I concluded that the tidal currents took very little part in the transaction .

In these cases of shore extension it is almost certain that·the wind waves play an

.

important part both by facilitating littoral drift and by building slender strips or beaches in shallow waters, as will be presently described. That the extremities of beaches hook or turn inland does not prove that their extensions are due to the flood tide; for, similar forms occur around the Great Lakes and the Black Sea. Moreover, large waves, which chiefly cause the drifting of material, can only arise when the "fetch" is considerable, which implies an on-shore wind. Generally speaking, beaches are formed by the action of the waves in shallow water upon the detritus there occurring. The result is a slender strip of sandy beach remarkable for its straightness, particularly upon its outer side. The axis of such a beach generally follows what probably was a contour line before the existence of the beach. For the ocean, this contourline probably lay 4 or 5 fathoms below ordinary low water; for the Gulf of Mexico 3 or 4 fathoms, and for shallow bays 2 or 3 fathoms. Why a shoal should originate in waters of these depths is a question difficult to answer with certainty; but the. following is probably a partial explanation: Owing to the shelving character of the sea bottom along the coast, an on-shore wind will cause the surface (troughs and crests of. waves being averaged) to assume a slope. This will cause the water at the bottom to flow seaward.* This seaward current becomes feebler as the water becomes deeper. At some depth it will fail to drive sand ·before it, deposition will take place, and a bar be formed along a certain contour line. As the bar grows in height, the current may be somewhat stronger than before immediately over the bar, but the bar itself would serve to intercept the detritus while being driven seaward. Finally, when the shoal ap?roaches the surface of the water, the waves become more like waves of translation and throw up sand and other material as if breaking upon the original shoreline. Such waves produce an evening and compacting effect, thus explaining why the outer side of a beach is more regular than the inner. If separate islands are formed, currents will aid the wind in joining them together through process of beach extension. · The beaches in the following localities are examples of those probably formed chiefly by the waves, but usually modified or cut by tpe tidal currents. At fhe mouths of rivers, bays, and harbors, beaches extend from the land. Besides the deposition received from the recoil or wind waves, ~nother usually occurs as a result of wind waves and current driving material along the margins of the narrow stri.ps 'of land, causing extension: Islands of Nantucket, Chappaquiddick, and Marthas Vineyard; southern coast of Long Island; the coast of New Jersey; the coast of North Carolina; the coast of

Louisiana; the coast of Texas; Bolinas Lagoon; Humboldt Bay; Coos Bay; Tillamook Bay; mouth of the Columbia River; Willapa Bay; Grays Harbor; Drayton Harbor; Port Clarence; southern coast of England. If but one cape at the entrance to a bay or river receives an extension, this arm may crowd the channel up close to the opposite bank or even move the mouth of a river some distance along the coast. E.g. Beach at Yarmouth; Oxfordness Beach; beaches at the mouths of several· rivers in Oregon. Great Point, Nantucket Island, is a beach extension. It is pro~able that sand and other material is not driven along the eastern foreshore of the island by tidal currents alone, but that ·the impact of the wind waves continmtlly drives loose objects northward. Lieut. Charles H. Davis, U. S. Navy, has mentioned several wrecks on the southern shore of the island, and called attention to the fact that coal and even bricks from the wreckage were found ·inside of Great Point.* These could not have been driven along by tidal currents. In the following localities are beaches (bars) formed almost wholly by wave action, including beach-extension processes: Sea of Azov; northern portion of the Black Sea; Mediterranean shore east of Alexandria; Prince Edward County, Sodus Bays, Toronto Harbor, and Burlington Bay, on Lake Ontario; Erie Harbor, Long Point Bay, Point Pelee, Sandusky Bay, and. Maumee Bay, on Lake Erie; Tawas Harbor, Lake Huron; eastern and southern shores of Lake Michigan; Chequamegon Bay and Duluth Harbor, Lake Superior. ·
105. The formation of spits or submerged capes.

A sandy cape or point upon an alluvial shore is generally supplemented by a shoal or spit extending outward to a considerable distance from the land. The littoral tidaJ currents h.ave their velocities suddenly diminished in passing the cape, because they are there largely deflected and turned into deeper water. By virtue of both flood and ebb, the spit generally takes a direction nearly normal to the coast line at the cape, thus differing from a beach extension. But these two classes of points are not always distinct, because a shore extension originates at an angle in the coast line. As time goes on more sand is deposited upon the point and shoals, and in this manner the point continues to grow until other agencies or altered conditions cause the growth to cease. Shoals of this character extend outward from Capes Hatteras, Lookout, Fear, Romain, and Canaveral, the character of the coast favoring the formation of detritus necessary in the building of shoals. Examples of smaller shoals off capes and even off gentle curves in the shore line which may deflect the streams outward may be found along the northern shore of Long Island. Examples of slender capes, formed like beaches chiefly by wave action, occur around the Peconic Bays and Gardiners Bay, Long Island. · If a spit occurs at the junction of two tidal rivers, it may be regarded as the only portion of a bar off the mouth of the smaller river which the larger river will permit to remain owing to its own considerable currents. Examples of such spits'are: York Spit; Rappahannock Spit; off Cape Virgenes, Argentina.

Nearly all matter deposited along rocky coasts is to be found in bays where the velocity of currents is diminished. The following are a few papers relating to changes in shore line and the formation of beaches: H. Mitchell: U. S.

lo6. Why deposition takes Place near the inner shore of a bend.

If we take, by way ot experiment, a circular vessel partially filled with water, we can, by moving a paddle round and round, soon set up a circular motion or vortex. If finely divided material like com meal or fine sand be scattered upon the moving liquid, it will before long be found to be collecting at the center of the bottom. An inspection of the paths of these particles will show that they are driven along the bottom spirally toward the center. The explanation of this is that because of the friction of the bottom on the liquid, the motion is there somewhat reduced in amount. If there were no resistance in the vessel, the surface would be in equilibrium with the force of gravity and the centrifugal force. Since resistance exists, particularly at the bottom, the centrifugal force is there less than at the surface. The surface adjacent to the vessel is lowered, because of the decreased motion of the underlying strata. Hence it is no longer in equilibrium, ·but its particles tend outward.· Since the surface along the vessel is elevated too much to correspond with the centrifugal force due to the smaller velocity near the bottom, an inward pressure gradient must exist at the bottom. Hence the inward velocity. If the velocity set up is ascertained by observing particles on the surface of the liquid, it will be found that the theoretical height, section l 2, Part IV A, is not realized. This discrepancy is due to the fact that the velocities below the surface are considerably reduced. Now, the outer shore of a bend in a river. corresponds to the edge of the vessel of water, while the inner shore corresponds to an imaginary boundary of the central area.
107.

Power contained in the tide.

If a natural or artificial reservoir be connected with a tidal body by a narrow channel or sluice, a considerable difference in level between the surfaces of the two bodies will generally exist. This difference reduces to zero once on each rise or fall of tide. If the surface of the reservoir rise or fall l foot, it will absorb or give up
(5280) 2 X64= l,784,217,600 (302)

foot-pounds of work for each square mile of impounded areas, or
(6080) 2 x 64 = 2,365,849,600 (303) ioot-pounds for each square nautical mile, 64 pounds being the assumed weight of a

cubic foot of sea water.

432

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

The average available fall is generally much less than the range of tide in the reservoir; for, even with sluice gates making it possible to fill the reservoir at nearly the time of outside high tide and to empty it at nearly the time of outside low tide, the average fall for any considerable period of filling or emptying will be much less than the range uf tide. When no gates are employed, the difference in level between the two water surfaces at any given phase of tide can be computed by means of section 9, Part IV A. If the inner l)ody is so large and so shallow that its surface does not remain practically level, then the question of available height difference becomes more co·mplicated. A large natural body of water used as a tidal reservoir would generally present difficulties of this kind. One horsepower requires 550 foot-pounds of work per second, or 1 ,980,000 foot_ pounds per hour or 24,592,790 foot-pounds per half tidal day. Hence, 1 foot of availaWe fall between reservoir and sea, occurring four times daily, has a maximum possible yield of 145.100 horsepower for each square statute mile, or 192 .402 for each square nautical mile. Some natural bodies of water suitable for tide mills are St. John River, New Brunswick; Grea~ Bay and Piscataqua River, New Hampshire; Vancouver, British Columbia; Burrard Inlet and Narrows, British Columbia. In estuaries, broad rivers, and shallow bays, artificial bodies of water can generally be formed by means of piers or dikes built across the tidal flats and more or less extended, according to the shape of the coast line. The following are a few references to the subject of tide mills: Lord Kelvin: Popular Lectures and Addresses, Vol. II, pp. 437-440. W. H. Wheeler: A Practical Manual of Tides and Waves (1906), pp. 170--173.

CHAPTER VIII.
CIRCULATION OF THE SEA, AND ANNUAL INEQUALITY IN THE TIDES.

108. General causes of the winds.

The heat of the sun causes expansion in the lower strata of air, especially in the Torrid Zone. These cause all superincumbent strata to be elevated above their equilibrium levels. By considering a surface of equal pressure in the higher regions of the atmosphere, it will be seen that the surface must dip poleward, and so the fluid particles at high altitudes must move away from the equator. (See Figs. 18 and 19.) · In section r 1, Part IV B, it is shown that a body moving in the Northern Hemisphere is deflected to the right, while a body moving in the Southern Hemisphere is deflected to the left. Consequently, a body moving from the equator toward either pole is deflected to the east. According to this reasoning, the winds in the upper strata of the atmosphere of the Northern ~emisphere should blow from the south in the equatorial regions and southwest and west in higher latitudes; for the Southern Hemisphere the winds should blow from the north, northwest, and west. This is somewhat at variance with experience, especially in the lower latitudes. The outflow of the air from high altitudes of the equatorial regions tends to diminish the pressure observed there upon the earth's surface. This is seen very near the equator, where the eastward motion is theoretically small, and so does not tend to crowd the matter toward the equator as much as does such motion a little farther north or south. At the equator and at the poles the meridional motion of particles must be in general comparatively small, since these places mark the limits of the excursions of the particles. Now, the deflecting force due to the earth's rotation varies with t.he velocity of the particles and the sine of the latitude conjointly. The effect of this force upon the general circulation of the atmosphere is to so· divert the pole-seeking particles in the various latitudes that the attainment of velocities exceeding certain values becomes impossible, and consequently to hold a quantity of the upper atmosphere near the equator which would otherwise have gone toward the poles. The velocities of the general atmosphere diminish as the equator is approached, and so in the tropical regions the deflecting force in the higher strata must be very small. From observation it is known that in the Northern Hemisphere a belt of high pressure exists having, over the oceans, its axis along approximately the thirty-fifth parallel of latitude, while the similar belt in the Southern Hemisphere follows approximately the thirtieth parallel. To restore the air carried poleward in high or tolerably high altitudes, return currents of less altitude are necessitated. Between the ridges of high pressure the countercurrents extend to the surface of the earth, and being deflected westward by the earth's rotation; produce the trade winds.

The belts of high pressure cause the lowest layers of the return current in the near-by regions of higher. latitude to reverse, and for some distance, to move· poleward. It is thus seen that, in the tropics the winds experienced at the earth's surface are counter currents of the movements in high altitudes, while just outside the subtropical high-pressure areas a portion of the countercurrent is reversed. , The connection between wind and pressure at the earth's surface is generally such that the air is flowing away from a high area and toward a low area, but the directions of the movements are greatly influenced by the deflecting force of the earth's rotation acting upon the moving surface air and upon the air in higher altitudes. In fact, the movements of air are often the cause rather than the results of pressure gradients. Near a region of low pressure the directions of the motions may nearly coincide with the directions of the isobars, but farther away directions become approximately normal to each other. The alternate heating and cooling of large continental areas involves a falling and rising in the atmospheric pressure at that part of the earth's surface. The lower air flows toward such an area during the summer season, and out of it during the winter season. This is the origin of the monsoons. io9. The prevailing winds over the surface of the oceans. The prevailing winds in. the Atlantic Ocean between parallels 35° and 60° north come from the southwest or west. In a zone extending for 30° on either side of the equator, the easterly winds are remarkably constant, but not strong, and are known as trade winds. North of the thermal equator they come from northeast, and south of it from south~st. Between parallels 35° and 60° south the winds are generally from . the west or a little north of west. In the Torrid Zone of the Pacific Ocean the prevailing winds are easterly. South of 40° south latitude they come from the west or a little north of west; north of 40° north latitude they come from the southwest. The winds of the Indian Ocean north of the equator are northeasterly during the winter season and southwesterly during the summer. In the winter a high-pressure area exists over eastern Asia, and in the summer a low-pressure are~ over southern Asia. South of 40° south latitude they generally blow from the west or northwest. In all oceans the wind velocity is small near the equator. Along the coast of Norway the winds are gent:!rally southwesterly. In that portion of the Arctic traversed by the Fram the winds blow from near the New Siberian Islands toward southeastern Greenland, where a· low-pressure area exists. In the part of the Arctic Archipelago just north of Lancaster and Melville Sounds, the wind is ~rom the north. At Point Barrow it is east-northeast. North of Greenland and Grant Land it is westerly or northwesterly during the summer season. It will be seen upon comparing the isobaric chart with the charts of the winds that the air particles approach and swirl round areas of low pressure and recede, in a similar manner but with. less velocity, from areas of high pressure. Rotations against the sun indicate low areas in the northern hemisphere and high areas in the so~thern, and vice versa for rotation with the sun ..

The direct effect of the wind.

If a wind blows for a considerable time in one direction over an inclosed body of water the surface particles are carried or drifted from their original position through the impingement of the air upon them. These particles drag with them those situated immediately below the surfac;e, and in time this dragging influence will be felt down to considerable depths. The effect of these horizontal forces on the waters of a closed body is to increase the height of water level on the lee shore and to diminish it upon the opposite shore, although not generally by the same amount. In shallow bodies, or along the shelving shores of the ocean, the amount of this elevation may be considerable, as will be seen upon consulting sections 123, 124. In deep bodies with abrupt shores, the piling up is very small although there may be a good surface drift maintained by the wind. The reason for this is that the horizontal forces due to the wind do not act alike upon the particles at all depths, as do the tidal forces; for, they are considerable at the surface and insignificant near the bottom. Consequently the pressure due to the increased depth on the lee shore quickly gives rise to an acceleration in the reverse direction which exceeds, at everi moderate depths, the acceleration imparted to the liquid elements by the moving elements situated nearer the surface. Hence the retrograde movement of the water not only near the bottom but for a considerable distance upward. Because of its much greater transverse section, the returning stream is as a rule scarcely perceptible, although the velocity of the surface stream may be considerable. Of course this counter movement also exists in the shallow bodies just referred to, because the wind's action can not be alike at all depths (like tidal forces), and so the body can not be in equilibrium under their action. Consequently there must be a drifting before the wind and a return current along the bottom. This may be regarded as the circulation in vertical planes due directly to the wind striking the surface of the water. What may be regarded as the horizontal circulation will be briefly considered in describing the ocean currents, sections 111-115. All the above remarks suppose the wind to be constant for some time, or at least prevailing, in the case of an ocean. If the wind is of comparatively short duration it

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

may give rise to seiche oscillations, which have been described in section 16, Part I, and will be further considered in Chapter IX, Part V. Circulation in horizontal orbits constitute a very general and obvious effect of the direct action of the winds upon the surface and are considered in several of the immediately following sections.
1 l l.

Currents of the Atlantic Ocean.

The effect which a constantly blowing wind may have in creating and maintaining surface currents or drifts in a given body of water depends largely upon the size, depth, and shape of the body. One of the most simple cases is a circular, elliptical, or oval body across one edge or limb of which the wind acts in approximately the direction of the boundary at this locality. (See Fig. 25.) If at other edges of the basin the winds follow t.he direction of the near-by boundary still greater circulation will be imparted to the water, and it will reach to greater depths below the surface. The central .portion will be comparatively quit:t, forming a sargasso sea. Examples of this are; the North Atlantic up to about the forty-fifth parallel; the South Atlantic to a line extending from Cape of Good Hope No. 25. to the Falkland Islands. In either of these cases the body considered is not entirely surrounded by land, but an inspection of the wind directions will readily convince one that the results could hardly have been essentially different had .there been a rigid wall extending across the North Atlantic along the forty-fifth parallel, another extending from Cape of Good Hope to the Falkland Islands, and even another along the Equator. In fact, were these walls in existence, then it would be possible for an east wind in the Torrid Zone to alone maintain the circulation in both basins. : This is nearly the case which Krummel * illustrated and established by experiment. (See Fig. 20.) The north equatorial trade winds of the Atlantic blow from the northeast and east, giving rise to the resulting westerly drift, which was noticed by Columbus in his first voyage to the West Indies. He referred the cause of these motions to the westward motion of the primum mobile. t The Gulf Stream was encountered by Ponce de Leon in 1513, as he skirted the coast of the peninsula of Florida, from a point north of Cape Canaveral to the Tortugas Islands. Franklin was the first to make a scientific study of the subject. Its origin in the Straits of Florida is briefly explained in section II6; but its continuance across the Atlantic is due to the prevailing westerly winds, sometimes known as anti-trades. One portion of the stream impinges against Great Britain and Ireland, and probably extends as far to the northeast as Nova Zembla; the other branch continues easterly until it turns southward along the coasts of Portugal, Spain, and Africa. Along the African coast this branch is called the Canary Stream, and it joins the North Equatorial Drift in the vicinity of the Cape Verde Islands. From here the drift is rapid, averaging about 10 miles a day. Through t~e Lesser Antilles the surface

velocity exceeds 1 knot per hour. A good drift covers the Caribbean Sea and passes, mainly by force of gravity, through the Yucatan Channel. The larger portion c.f this water is spread out in the Gulf, but the smaller portion at once makes for the Straits of Florida in its effort to seek a lower level.* A portion of the western drift passes to the north of the Greater Antilles, and as a connecting current fom1s the western boundary of the Sargasso Sea. According to the maps of Lieutenant Soley, one part of the Gulf Stream upon emerging from the Yucatan Channel turns westward and passes around or across the Campeche Bank-across if north winds prevail. From near .Tampico, at the head of the Gulf, the main stream goes northeasterly to a point not far from the Mississippi Delta. An important northwestern branch goes from Yucatan Channel to join the branch just described near the Mississippi Delta. From this locality a stream flows southeasterly to the western end of Florida Strait. The winds of the Gulf are northerly from October to February, inclusive, and southeasterly during the remainder of the year. The result of the southeasterly wind is to strengthen in the summer time' the branch of the Gulf Stream extending from Yucatan Channel nearly to the Mississippi Delta. An eastern branch goes directly from Yucatan Chan~el to Florida Strait. A counter curren_t occupies the shallow northwestern comer of the Gulf. In a somewhat similar manner the shallow eastern edge of the Gulf is probably occupied by a weak northerly counter current. A current flows along the northern coast of Cuba and extends around Cape San Antonio, a little beyond the Isle of Pines. The velocities of the principal streams within the Gulf generally lie between 0.5 knot and 2 knots. It may be of interest to note here that as long ago as 1856 a bottle was picked up on Loggerhead Key, Florida Reef, by a Coast Survey party, which had been set adrift nearly two years before at a point south of the Mississippi Delta (Coast Survey Report, 1856, p. 279). This indicated the existence of a branch of the Gulf current mentioned above, which Lieutenant Soley has fully established. The south equatorial trade winds blowing from the south and east, together with the resulting westerly drift, carried the navigator Cabral from his track, projected for rounding Africa, upon the coast of Brazil, thus giving to him the honor of its discovery. Off Cape Roque the drift divides, one branch, known as the Guiana Current, flows northwesterly, joining the north equatorial drift; the other, known as the Brazilian, flows southwesterly toward the Falkland Islands. The east-going stream across the Atlantic; in the latitude of Tristan da Cunha, greatly increased in volume by cold water from the south, and the north-going· stream west of South Africa, c~mplcte the circuit for this South Atlantic area.
1 1 2.

Currents around the Antarctic Continent.

The prevailing. winds off the coasts of the Antarctic Continent are westerly. These impart an eastward motion to the surrounding waters. This can be easily detected in the strait between Cape Hom and the South Shetland Islands, where the velocitv is I 1 miles per day. The general direction and amount of drift can be inferred from -the fact that a bottle floated from Cape Hom to Port Phillip, on the south coast of Australia, a distance exceeding 8000 miles, in three and one-half years.
*Cf. A. Lindenkohl: U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1895, pp. 364, 365.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

The immediate cause of the Cape Horn Stream is partly gravitational; for, the . westerly winds force the waters against the Chilean coast, and the western coast of South Shetland Islands, and an escape to a slightly lower level is through the strait. Another portion of these accumulated waters flows northward, joining the Peruvian Current. The cold streams from the Antarctic are felt as far north as off the Rio de la Plata, along the western coast of South Africa, and all along the western coast of Chile.*
I 13.

Currents in the Pac,ific Ocean.

The Peruvian or Hl.Uilboldt Current flows northerly, following the South American coast, sustained by the prevailing winds which here blow from the south; the velocity of this stream along the Peruvian coast lies between one-half and 1 knot. The current leaves the Americ.an coast near Cape Blanco, with. a velocity perhaps as high as r ! knots and, much diminished in velocity and increased in width, flows westward under the influence of the south equatorial trade winds of the Pacific. Upon reaching the Pamotu Islands, a portion of this equatorial drift is deflected southerly and joins the general east-going drift referred to above. The ~emainder of the current has a general westerly direction. The northern equatorial drift is mainly confined between parallels 10° and 25° north. Near the Hawaiian Islands the currents are variable but their general direction is probably westerly, with a velocity of r knot. Among the Marshall Islands the currents are. irregular, with perhaps a prevailing westerly direction. North of the fortieth parallel and across the Pacific Ocean the prevailing wind is from the southwest, and imparts an easterly motion to the waters of this region, and so accounts for the eastward continuation of the Kuro Siwo. This stream impinges upon the American coast, tempering the climate from Alaska to California. A portion of the drift known as the Californian Current flows southward off the .coasts of Upper and Lower California, and finally joins the west-going drift. The Kuro Siwo proper is a continuation and reflex of the north equatorial. drift current, and so in part due to the east~rly drift in the North Pacific; in other words, it is in part a connecting current. In part its immediate cause is gravitational, at least during the southwest monsoon. At that season the surface of the northern end of the China Sea must be on a higher level than the surface of the Pacific outside. This would account for such annual fluctuation of the intensity of the stream as exists southeast of Formosa. East of Australia a counter-clockwise circulation· exists, caused mainly by southeasterly winds acting upon the waters surrounding New Caledonia and the northwesterly wind acting upon the waters southeast from Tasmania.
114.

Currents in the Indian Ocean.

North of the equator is the region of monsoons. Here the current has a northeasterly direction during the summer season of the northern hemisphere and a southwesterly direction during the winter season. · Between about 8° and 20° of south latitude is a west-going drift, due to the tolerably constant trade winds.

In the Indian Ocean south of the parallel of Cape of Good Hope the drift is in an easterly direction, agreeing with the general circulation around the Antarctic Continent. A branch of this drift turned northward by the coast of Australia, and known as the West-Australian Current, finally joins the west-going drift just referred to. The ·west-going drift is connected with the east-going by southwest~ly currents along the coast of Madagascar. ,
115. Currents in the Arctic Ocean.

Some account of the movements of the sur.ace currents of the Arctic from a point near Herald Island toward Cape Farewell, Greenland, has been given in section 46, Part IV B. Generally speaking, the direction of these currents in the open ocean approximately agrees with the direction toward which .the winds blow. This was found to be the case by Nansen in the drifting of the Fram, and is probably true for most of the waters intersecting the Arctic Archipelago. Along the northern coast of Greenland and north of Grant Land, Peary found the northwesterly winds and the ice setting easterly. Weyprecht and Payer, in the Tegetthoff, drifted from off Northern Nova Zembfa northward and thus, in 1873, discovered Franz Josef Land. These indicate lateral movements toward the channel between Greenland and Spitzbergen and through which the ice escapes from the Arctic. The southward current through Robeson and Kennedy channels has been well established by Hall, Greely, and others. The cold Labrador Current comes from Hudson Strait and the western side of Baffin Bay. It is felt as far south as Cape Hatteras, being sheltered from the west winds by the American coast, and being crowded against it by the deflecting force of the earth's rotation. A small portion of this stream traverses the. Gulf of St. Lawrence, entering through the Strait of Belle Isle and leaving through Cabot Strait, although it is probably lost in the waters of the Gulf. All of the above currents indicate a general surface movement from a region where the waters are of less density into one having warmer but denser waters. But by section. n6 this implies that, save for the effect of the prevailing winds, the surface of the Artie is slightly higher than the surface of the Atlantic. This seems reasonable because of the considerable 'precipitatio1l and very small evaporation in cold regions. Because of its smaller density, the fresh water tends to remain upon the surface. It may be noted here.that the direction of the prevailing current at Point Barrow is supposed to be eastward, while a long series of observations at the Government station a few miles t.o the southwest of the point showed that the prevailing win'd was from

ENE.
As mention~d in section 116, the immediate cause of the reversible currents through Bering Strait is probably gravitational-similar to the flow between Lakes Michigan and Huron, when strong winds blow over their surfaces. When the northern, part of Bering Sea is from any cause for some time higher than usual, the flow is northward; and when lower than usual, southward. The southerly winds in the s~mmer bring about the first condition and the northerly winds during the remainder of the year, the second. More detailed information concerning ocean currents can be obtained from the maps, Figs. 20-24.

440

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

II6. Currents whose immediate cause is a difference in surface-levels, in water-densities, or in both combined.

Bodies of water, or two portions of the same body, may, through prevailing winds, evaporation, precipitation, or influx of water from the land, assume slightly different surface-levels or possess different densities. These conditions give rise to currents, and may be divided into four cases, real or hypothetical, viz.: Like densities but different surface-levels, like surface-levels but different densities, the denser body having the higher surface-level, the lighter hody having the higher surface-level. Case r .-Like densities and different surface-levels. In attempting to restore equilibrium, the water will continually' flow from the higher body (i. e., the body whose surface is the higher) into the lower. If the connecting strait is sufficiently small for enabling a sensible difference in surface-level to be maintained, · the velocity may there be considerable. The velocity at the narrowest part of the strait and in the swiftest thread of the stream will be approximately equal to ,,/ 2g (z,-z 11 ) where z,, z11 , denote the heights of the surfaces of the two bodies above a fixed datum. The effect of the north-equatorial trade winds is to elevate the water in the Carribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico above the general level of the Atlantic. Levels run across Florida between Cedar Keys and St. Augustine indicate a difference of level amounting to probably at least o.8 foot. This implies a velocity of 7.2 feet per second,' or 4.3 knots per hour, for the swiftest thread-an amount not greatly in excess of the observed value 3.4 knots (sec. 97). The above is in substantial agreement with Franklin's explanation. He says:
This stream is probably generated by the great accumulation of water on the eastern coast of America between the tropics by the trade winds which constantly blow there. It is known that a large piece of water, 10 miles broad and generally only 3 feet deep, has, by a strong wind, had its water driven to one side and sustained so as to become 6 feet deep, while the windward side was laid dry. This may give some idea of the quantity heaped upon the American coast, and the reason of its running down in a strong current through the islands into the Bay of Mexico and from thence proceeding along the coasts and banks of Newfoundland where it turns off toward and runs down through the Western Islands.*

Case 2.-Like surface-levels, different densities. So long as this condition can be maintained, it is evident that the surfaces of equal pressure in the connecting strait (the free surface excepted) all slope downward toward the lighter body ; hence any liquid element will be driven toward that body. The accelerating force will increase in, going downward, but this does not mean that the velocity will be comparatively small at· the surface; for, by the viscosity of water the under layers would finally impart their velocities to the waters above. Case 3.-The denser body having the higher surface-level. Here the .flow at all depths is obviously from the higher and denser to the lower and less dense body. An example of this is the current through Bering Strait from the Bering Sea to the Arctic during the summer season when the surface of the former stands at a higher level than the surface of the latter.

APPENDIX 6.

CURRENTS, SHALLOW-WATER TIDES, ETC.

441

Case 4.-The lighter body having the higher surface-level.

Since the surface of the less dense body or region is slightly h_igher than the surface of the one more dense, the water near the surface will flow toward the lower but-denser body. If at some depth below the surface the pressure due to depth be equal in the two bodies (that is, if there the surface of equal pressure be horizontal) there will be no tendency to flow in either direction. Below this surface, the surfaces of equal pressure will slope downward toward the lighter body; hence near the bottom the water will flow toward the lighter body notwithstanding the fact that its free surface is on a higher level. The surface water of the Arctic Ocean moves toward the Atlantic through Denmark and Davis straits. The considerable precipitation, the influx from several large rivers, and especially the small evaporation, all go to maintaining a rather low density for Arctic waters as well as an increased, but of course very smaJI, elevation of the surface. The difference in the densities as actually existing is less than that indicated upon charts, because the chart values have been reduced to standard temperatures, and the polar seas, all depths considered, are in reality several degrees colder than the equatorial waters. But near the land, where the amount of fresh water greatly reduces the density, the water's surface is considerably elevated and may give rise to strong and cold currents, particularly in channels and on the right-hand side of the sea or body trave.rsed. This crowding against the land, ·and prevention of the stream from dispe.;sion, is due to the deflecting force of the earth's rotation. Doubtless a considerable amount of water passes as an undercurrent from the Atlantic into the Arctic through the straits east and west of Iceland. That such is the case can be inferred from the fact that .the density of the A.retie, well below the surface, about equals the density found in these straits. Another example of this case is the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Atlantic Ocean. Strong surface currents exist in Cabot Strait, the velocity near Cape North being 2 knots. The Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea constitute another example. The surface current nearly always sets easterly in the axis of the strait, the velocity being about 3 knots; but below the surface this eastward flow is less marked. (See section . 84, Part IV B.) It is certain that at the bottom the flow is westerly; for, the waters of the Mediterranean must be sufficiently dense through the evaporation of ocean water for causing the lines of equal pressure near the bottom of the strait to slope westerly, otherwise the Mediterranean would be continually deriving salt from the Atlantic.* According to a report ~f M. Ch. Lallemand in the Comptes-Rendus of the twelfth general conference of the International Geodetic Association on the general leveling in France it appears that mean sea level for Biarritz, at the head of the Bay of Biscay, is 2 1 centimeters above that at Marseilles. It also appears that the mean sea level at the capes upon which Brest and Cherbourg are situated is somewhat lower than the level at :Marseilles. These are conditions which might result from the action of the prevailing westerly winds. By analogy it is reasonable to suppose that the sea level off the western end of the Strait of Gibraltar is elevated a few inches by the action of the prevailing winds upon foe bay -forming the approach to the strait; but this difference of level must be small,

because the pressure at the depth of the bottom of the strait is known to be greater in the Mediterranean than in the Atlantic (in order to produce an outward flow), and the difference in density is not very great (section 120). From page 2 l of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot, fifth edition, the following, concerning the currents in the strait of Bab el Mandeb, is quoted:
From about May to September, while the southwest monsoon is blowing in the Indian Ocean, the water runs out of the Red Sea; but, during the northeast monsoon, from October to March, it runs in; thus accounting for the difference of level before remarked upon, which has been observed to depend upon the season of the year. In the strait of Bab el Mandeb these currents often have a rate of 30 or 40 miles a day, but their strength is much diminished a few miles up the sea; and in the strait it. is somewhat confused through the irregular tidal influence there felt. At the change of the monsoon there is little or no current.

This is in accord with the general rule for the annual inequality in sea level in the western part of the Indian Ocean; for, upon referring to section 124 it will be seen that high water for this part of the ocean occurs in north winter whife low water occurs in north summer. In this strait the surface current has been observed to go in the direction toward which the wind blows, w.hile near the bottom there was a contrary setting. . A fresh-water str~m discharging into the ocean may cause counter currents at the bottom of the channel of the stream and for some distance along the bottom of the outer body. · Examples of this are the straits and sounds connecting the Balt~c Sea with the North Sea, the Hudson River, and off the Mississippi River. · For the Baltic, see papers referred to below by F. L. Ekman, V. W. Ekman, and A. W. Cronander. For the Hudson, see a paper by Henry Mitchell, U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1887, pp. 301 3u. It has long· been known that off the mouth of the Mississippi the colored surface water takes a different direction from that taken by the clear or blue water below. The existence of a ·counter current has not been established by observation. In fact observations made by R. Platt while engaged in work for this survey off the delta indicate chiefly that the under currents take a variety of directions with reference to the surface currents. In the river proper, the volume of fresh water is so great that salt water does not enter, and so counter currents do not there occur.

u7. Currents in lakes and bays.
The Great Lakes of America have mam currents moving toward their outlets. The position of such a current with reference to either shore of a lake is determined chiefly with reference to the directions of discharge. In case of Lakes Superior, Michigan, or Huron, the main current lies nearer to the right side than to the left. This suggests the deflecting force of the earth's rotation upon a freely moving. body, as the influence governing the position of the axis of the stream. But as this tendency to crowding to the right is not conspicuous in either Lake Erie or Lake Ontario, where the velocity of the current proper must be mµch greater than that. belonging to the upper lakes, it seems almost certain that the influence of this force is too small to be of importance in any of the other lakes.

Currents, especially at the surface, are caused by winds. In this region, the prevailing wind direction js westerly and so the currents produced directly by them, particularly in exposed places, take an easterly direction. On account of the limited size of any one of these lakes, it is not probable that in any forced current produced by the winds the paths of the water particles will show any general deviation to the right of the direction of the paths of the air particles. The swiftest of all surface currents in the Great Lakes proper are probably those produced by the winds acting upon the waters of Lakes Michigan and Huron, causing the surfaces of the two bodies of water to differ in level by a considerable amount. This greatly increases for a time th~ discharge of water through the. Strait of Mackinac. Observations off Manistee, Lake Michigan, showed a northerly current of from 1 ! to 4 statute miles per hour. In protected places, and particularly along the more irregular shore, counter currents due chiefly to wind currents may exist. The circulation of the Great Lakes is described in a paper by Mark W. Harrington, entitled "Currents of the Great Lakes, as deduced from the Movements of Bottle Papers during the seasons of 1892 and 1893," and in Sailing Directions, published by the U. S. HydrographicOffice (1900-1902), numbered 108 A, and 108 B, 108 C, and 108 D. The winds which chiefly c.ause the currents in the Black Sea appear to take various directions over different parts of it. A recent discussion of the currents of this sea is made by Walther Wissema~n on pages 162-180 of the Annalen der Hydrographie, Volume 34, 1906. A counterclockwise circulation takes place in the Mediterranean Sea, including the .tEgean and the Adriatic sea~. There is a dependent current or eddy in the gulf off Tripoli. The influx ~f water through the Strait of Gibraltar, the straightness of the African coast, and the prevailing westerly winds, account, in the main, for the eastward current very near the southern border of the sea; while the irregularity of the European coast favors a return current protected from the prevailing winds. The deflecting force of the earth's rotation probably causes the return current to enter the .tEgean and Adriatic seas. Currents dependent upon contact with others are of common occurrence in partially inclosed bodies of water. If the outer currents flow clockwise in their circuit, the dependent current will flow counterclockwise, and vice versi. The current in the southwestern corner of the Caribbean Sea and that in the Bay of Honduras are examples of this. Other exan:iples are the Gulf of Guinea and near-by waters, the waters lying between Iceland and southern Greenland. The currents in the Japan Sea consist of a branch of the Kuro Siwo, and a counter current necessitated by it fl.owing southerly along the continental coast line. The currents of the Greenland Sea and northern extremities of the Atlantic Ocean have recently been ascertained with considerable precision through the agency of bottles set adrift and afterwards recovered. The results of such observations are given in a paper by C. Ryder in the Nautical Meteorological Annual for 1904 (Copenhagen, 1905). It will be noticed that the north-going streams hug the coast to their right or the east, while those going southward, the coast to their right or the west. This agrees with what might have been anticipated from a knowledge of the deflecting force due to the earth's rotation.

444

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

But it appears that north winds prevail down the eastern coast of Greenland and southerly ones between Norway and Iceland, due to the fact that a region of low barometer lies between these two coasts. Hence it is probable that the circulation between Iceland and Norway and between Iceland and Southern Greenland is chiefly to be explained by Kriimmel's experiment; but that the deflecting force of the earth's rotation causes the streams, wh'ether free or under the action of the sustaining winds, to crowd upon the shores of Norway and southern Greenland. The openness of these bodies of water would preclude the explanation given for return streams against the winds in lakes and land~locked seas, from applying here. The deflecting force of the earth's rotation accounts for the fact that the currents flow inward along the eastern shores of the Adriatic and Red seas and Baffin Bay, and outward along the western shores.

Note on recent theoretical work.

The influence of the earth's rotation upon ocean currents is mentioned by Maclaurin in his prize essay upon the tides.* The equations of motion for a liquid upon a rotating sphere lie at the foundation of Laplace's dynamical theory of tides. Ferrel makes constant use of the principle, following at once from Laplace's equations, that a moving particle is deflected to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern. Before the work of V. Bjerknes the ocean currents were treated as free currents, i. e., as if they would move onward by their own inertia after the forces ceased to act. Nansen suspected from observation, and V. W. Ekman confirmed by computation, that forced or sustained currents take, if circumstances permit, a direction to the right of the sustaining force in the northern hemisphere. Moreover, as wind action is from the surface downward (each layer moving the one underneath it) the direction of the lower layer will likewise be to the right of the one imparting the motion. Supposing all moti.ons in an indefinitely large body of water acted upon by the winds to be steady and horizontal, then the equations of motion become very simple. The external forces for a given water element arc the components of the earth's deflecting force, and the only other forces acting are the components of the resistance due to viscosity. Integrating these equations and determining the arbitrary constants to suit the assumed problem, it follows, that in the northern hemisphere, the surface currents take a direction 45° to the right of the direction of the wind, and that this angle increases with the depth. Ekman also considers currents caused by pressure-gradient and the earth's rotation alone, and wind currents influenced by the continents, currents which arise from a difference of density, and the action of both wind and density variation. See references to Ekman below. On account of the actual distribution of land and water, it is difficult to say at this time to what extent Ekman's theory of forced currents accounts for the existing ocean currents. The fact that there is a tendency for the water to flow to the right or left of the direction toward which the wind blows will doubtless be brought out for many regions. -------*This Manual, Part I, sec. 95.

The hydrodynamical problems involving the motions of waters of different densities, treated by V. Bjerknes and V. W. Ekman, are of fundamental importance in the mathematical treatment of the motions of the sea and adjacent waters.

12q. Note on density observations.

Density observations 'are easily made to a fair degree of precision by means of a hydrometer. One form of this instrument consists of a glass bulb terminated by a slender graduated stem, and a cup or can into which the specimen of sea water is placed and within which .is mounted a thermometer for ascertaining the water's temperature. If the range of density is considerable, several bulbs should be provided so that the range of each need not much exceed 1 per cent. Recent observations have in many cases been reduced to the temperature 15° C. (= 59° F.) for the sea water and the standard temperature of the distilled water is taken as 4° C. (= 39°.2 F.). Results obtained by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey prior to 1,892, suppose both sea water and the standard distilled water to have the temperature 60° F. See report by Buchanan, Physics and Chemistry, Volume 1, qrnllenger Reports. In the Atlases of the Deutsche Seewarte both standard t~mperatures are
170.5

c.

Tables for reducing the observed densities to standard temperatures are given on page 155, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1874, and page 277, Report for 1891. In making the observations care must be taken to secure the water at the assumed position and depth, to give the attached thermometer time to adjust itself_ to the temperature of the water, and to see that the bulb is not in contact with the walls of the cup, but floats freely. In tidal rivers the stage of the tide should be noted.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907. THE ANNUAL FLUCTUATION OF WATER LEVEL.
I 21.

River fluctuations.

most fresh-water streams the surlace height and the velocity of flow are subject to variations through a yearly period, although great irregularities generally exist. Only the average, or somewhat regular, fluctuation will be here considered. The principal causes are the varying amounts of rain and evaporation, and the melting of snow in higher latitudes. The annual rising of the Nile had an important bearing upon early civilization and its cause was a subject of much speculation.* The brief description of the phenomenon by Herodotus finds itself in perfect accord with observations made at the dam below Cairo during the years 1849--1878. Herodotus says that the river begins to rise at the summer solstice and reaches its maximum height in about one hundred days. Figure 12-x in Supan's Grundziige der Physischen Erdkunde show~ this agreement. From the discussion of observations covering the seven years 1872-1878, it appears that the fluctuation in the surface of the Mississippi River at New Orleans resembles a sine curve whose maximum height is near the middle of May and whose minimum is near the middle of November; also that the range of this regular curve is IO feet. The fluctuations in the upper portions of the river and its tributaries is less regular in its character, and the range of the rise and fall is usually much greater than at New Orleans. The stages of the :r.li~sissippi River are shown in the hydrographs published in the Reports of the Mississippi River Commission, which forms a supplement to the recent Reports of the Chief of Engineers (United States Army). From these it will be seen that there are often several well-defined maxima and minima each year. The times of the principal maximum and minimum at Carrollton, La., may be given as about April 20 and November 25, respectively, the average range being about 16 feet. The lesser maxima perhaps occur about February 1 and June 15. It will be noticed that, as a rule, the rivers of the Atlantic slope of the United States north of Georgia, and gauged above tidal influences, will attain their regular annual maximum hclght and discharge in February, March, or April, and their minimum in August, September, or October. See next section. From the known g~ography and climatology of a given river basin some estimate can generally be made of the times when floods and freshets may be expected, also when the contributing streams should run unusually low. If these times are at variance with those given by the annual inequality in the water level as observed at some tidal station upon the river, one may be reasonably certain that the floods and freshets are, at that station, of secondary importance in producing this inequality. For instance, at Port Eads, situated on South Pass of the mouth of the Mississippi, the regular annual maximum height (sec. 124) occurs in October, the range being 0.9 foot, whereas, as already stated, the same river at New Orleans reaches its maximum height in April or May, the range being IO feet or more. On the other hand, if the range of the annual fluctuation much exceed 1 foot, excepting certain regions of shallow water, and those parts of the earth where monsoons - - · - - - - - - - - - - - - · .. - ----------------·-- - - - - - - - · - - · · - - - - - - - - - - - - -

prevail, it is probable that the upper-river stages control the annual fluctuations unless known meteorological facts are to the contrary. But what part is due to the efflux of river water and what to periodic winds is often difficult to determine. For example, at the river stations Calcutta and Rangoon, the annual high stage occurs about the first of September. But for southeastern Asia the rainy season occurs during the summer months and the dry season during the winter and spring. Consequently the heights of the rivers at these stations are governed by the efilux of the rivers. If this fluctuation were di:xe to the monsoons only, it is probable, as will be noted in the next section, that the maximum height would occur not later than August. The Great Lakes have an annual fluctuation of from 1 to 2 feet. They stand highest in August and lowest in February. Records extending over more than forty years are published in the Reports of the Chief of Engineers (United States Army).*

Direct action of winds in causing the annual height inequality.

In shallow arms of the ocean the direct action of the wind in altering the height of the surface is very apparent. Along the eastern coast of the United States the prevailing wind is northwesterly during the winter season and southwesterly, south, or southeasterly during the summer season. As a consequence the height of the sea is considerably lowered in the winter season and, at least in many localities, increased during the summer season. This explains the annual inequality at Governors Island, Baltimore, Old ·Point Comfort, Savannah River Entrance, and Fernandina, and in the main that for Philadelphia, Washington, and Wilmington (N. C.), although the upper-river stages are factors of some importance at these stations. At Philadelphia the high water of the annual fluctuation occurs about September 1 and the low water in December or January. There seems to be, however, a secondary high water in March and low water in May. According to river gaugings made by -the U.S. Geological Survey at Lambertville, N. J., the greatest monthly discharge of the Delaware River takes place during the month of March, the least during the month of September. At Washington, D. C., the high water of the annual fluctuation occurs in June or July, the low water about March 1. According to river gaugings made at Point of Rocks, Md., the greatest monthly discharge takes place during the month of March, the least during the month of September. At Wilmington, N. C., the high water oftheannualfluctuationoccursinSeptemberor October, the low water about March l. Gaugings at Fayetteville show that the months of greatest and least discharge nearly coincide with February and November. At gauging stations situated above tidal influence, an increase of height in the waterlevel is accompanied by an increase of discharge and the empirical relation between the two constitutes a rating table for the stream with reference to which it has been constructed. The northerly winds across the Gulf of Mexico produce low water at Galveston in February, while the southerly winds produce high water in October, the range being 1.5 feet. (The inundation and destruction of Galveston resulting from a West India hurricane occurred September 8, 1900.) According to observations made by the Coast Survey in 1847 and 1848, the average effect of a north wind is to depress the waters of Albemarle Sound, North Carolina, between one and two tenths of a foot, and the effect of a south or southwest wind is to raise the level by about the same amount.* The fact that the result was the same for both sides of the Sound indicates clearly that the action of the winds upon Pamlico Sound is the ·principal cause of the fluctuation in level. According to observations made in 1848 the average effect of southeasterly winds at Cat Island is to elevate the surface of the water 0.3 foot and that of north or northwest winds to depress the level 0.2 foot.t Along the coast of New England, Canada, and Newfoundland the annual inequality is small and uncertain, the winds there having a less marked annual change than farther southward. At Boston the prevailing winds at all seasons of the year are westerly, a little north of west in the winter, and somewhat southwesterly in the summer.t
*Report for 1856, p. 271. t Report for 1856, p. 278. t See Appendix No. 6, U. S. Coast Survey Report for 187 1. Here Ferrel shows the connection between the fluctuations of the sea and the variations of the barom~ter and the winds ..

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

The winter winds along the Atlantic coast of the United States are the strongest of the year; consequently the water is most diminished in height during that season. The prevailing summer winds of the southern and eastern coasts of Asia are nearly opposite in direction from the prevailing winter winds. (See Figs. 18, l 9, and table in section 124.) The southwest monsoon draws the water away from Aden and the Red Sea in the summer season, but tends to pile it up on the coast of Baluchistan and the upper India; it diminishes the height in the neighborhood of Minikoi and Ceylon, but increases the height at Bengal and the southwestern coast of Farther India. This explains the semiannual reversal of currents observed in the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb and mentioned in section 116. The southeasterly trend of the Malabar coast prevents the southwest monsoon from actually increasing much the height along the western coast, as the long series of observations at Karachi shows. At Dublat, the mouth of the Hooghly River, the maximum occurs late in July with a range of 1.8 feet; farther up, at Diamond Harbor, it occurs early in August with a range of 2.1 feet; while at Calcutta (Kidderpore), where the effects of the river stages are apparent, the maximum occurs about September l, the range being 6. l feet. The coast stations Chittagong and Akyab have annual inequalities of 3.2 and i.9 feet, respectively,with maxima occurring in July, thus agreeing with the monsoon season. For Elephant Point, a coast station at the mouth of the Rangoon River, the range of the annual inequality is 1.7 feet, while at Rangoon it is 2.7 feet. The maximum at the former place occurs about July 27 and at the latter place about August 26. Other coast stations are Port Blair (Andaman Islands), Mergui, and Amherst, with ranges 0.5, 1.2, 1.6 feet, respectively, and with maximum falling in or near August. The increase of range in going from the Andaman Islands to the main land is in accordance with what would necessarily result from wind effects. For details concerning the tidal stations and tides of India, see Account of the Operations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, Volume 16, Tidal Observations. By the southwest monsoon the water level is elevated during the summer season along the western coast of Luzon and especially in the Yellow Sea. Water is, however, drawn away from the southern portion of the China Sea. Among the East Indies the effects are various, because water can drift in or out from either the Indian or the Pacific Ocean. Although it is difficult to infer the time of maximum height from the known monsoons, there is little doubt that the annual fluctuation along the coast is chiefly a wind effect. The shallow and northern part of Bering Sea is elevated by southerly winds, which blow over Bering Sea during the summer season, and depressed by the northerly winds in winter. The southwesterly winds of autumn produce high water along the shores of the Gulf of Alaska, while the easterly winds of spring and summer P,roduce low waters. The easterly wind is strongest for the eastern coast of Australia in March, and in consequence the sea level at Sydney, Ballina, and Newcastle is highest in the {north) spring season. At Panama southwesterly winds prevail through the greater part of the year; but during the month of February, the winds are northeasterly. The annual fluctuation attains its maximum on about November 1 and its minimum on about February 20. The range of the oscillation is 2 .o feet.

By consulting the table given in section 124, it will be seen that for the Atlantic coast of Europe annual high water occurs from about September to December and low water from March to June. The range of the fluctuation is 1 .o foot at Greenock, 0.9 foot at Liverpool, but only 0.4 foot at Edinburgh, 0.5 at Sheerness, and 0.4 at London, and 0.3 at Ramsgate. Since greater ranges of annual tide occur on the western side of Great Britain and around Ireland than on the eastern side, the inference most readily drawn is that the winds are the controlling factor in its production. By consulting Pls. 21-24 of the Atlas of the Atlantic Ocean, by the German Seewarte, also Pl. 12 of Bartholomew's Physical Atlas (Meteorology), it will be seen that the west winds along the coasts of Europe are strongest in the autumn and weakest in the spring. As pointed out by Lentz in his Fluth and Ebbe, Chapter III, the annual tide of the Baltic coast of Germany is governed by the winds. In September it has a maximum height and in May a minimum. The minimum coincides in time with the maximum amount of northeasterly winds, which blow the water out of the Baltic into the North Sea. Levels run from Helder to Memel prove the existence of a permanent displacement of level produced by the winds, and comparable in order of magnitude with the annual fluctuation. It increases in height from Kiel to Memel. * At Wilhelmshaven the maximum height occurs about October 1, and the minimum early in April. The foregoing statements and the table in section 124 indicate that as a rule the water at most tidal stations stands highest in the summer or autumn and lowest in the winter or spring. This suggests that the annual fluctuation may be due to the alternate heating and cooling of the ocean waters, causing alternate expansion and contraction of the volumes. This possibility will be considered in the next section. Here it may be noted that as sea breezes at the earth's surface occur by day and land breezes by night, so the wind blows from the ocean in summer and from the lanc1 in winter. Without further assumptions we thus have an agency for producing the annual fluctuation and whose potency in many instances can not be doubted. High-pressure a"reas are formed on the lands in :winter and in the oceans in summer. Hence,·. the annual inequality can not be directly due to -this cause. Moreover, the annual barometric fluctuations are too small to account for the annual inequality in sea level at most places. It seldom has a range of more than 0.3 of an inch, and this could give only about 0.3 of a foot for the range of the annual inequality.t In some instances it undoubtedly increases the annual inequality, as at St. Paul, Kodiak Island, Alaska, where the minimum pressure occurs in winter and the· maximum in summer. Since winds along the surface of the earth are in a general way setting from highpressure areas toward low-pressure areas, it follows that indirectly these annual fluctuations in the barometer do in this sense greatly influence and even occasion the annual inequality in sea level. But as already intimated, the direct effect is often at variance with the indirect and far more important effect, viz., that.due to resulting winds.

125. On the possibility of the annual height inequality being due to fluctuations in the temperature of sea water. In an ocean or portion of an ocean lying upon one side of the equator, the heat directly radiated from the sun will· be absor'1ed most rapidly at the time of the summer solstice. The maximum rate of deriving heat from the earth's atmosphere and from inflowing streams must generally occur somewhat later. From the same sources least is being absorbed by the ocean soon after the winter solstice. From these considerations one may perhaps infer that the assumed body of water, all depths being considered, would contain the greatest amount of heat not earlier than the autumnal equinoxes, and the least not earlier than the vernal. For portions of the ocean lying in low latitudes these times will be accelerated, and the range of the annual temperature fluctuations will be less.* While it is undoubtedly true that the surface of the water in high latitudes stands on a slightly higher level than in low latitudes (as was pointed out in sec. 115), and is higher in the early autumn than in the early spring, it can be easily seen that this annual fluctuation can not be considerable, i. e., it can scarcely be a measurable quantity. Suppose the surface of the water at a point in high latitude to be o. 1 foot above the surface at a point 8000 miles away in the opposite hemisphere. The instantaneous slope will be 2 one-billionths. And so the accelerating force per unit mass will be 2g divided by one billion (Eq. 91, Part IV A). But this acting through, say, three months will give rise to a velocity of 0.52 foot per second at the surface. The velocity will diminish in going downward and the flow near the bottom will generally be opposite in direction to that at the surface. If the assumed distance were less than 8000 miles, this velocity would be increased in proportion. . As no such alternation of surfa~e flow from one hemisphere to the other has been observed, it is practically certain that the results due to annual temperature changes in the water can not cause an annual inequality in sea level with a range as great as o. l of;_ foot, and so this portion of it may be neglected. In an inclosed body of water the annual temperature changes may easily produce an annual height inequality, but this would be concealed by the much greater changes due to the varying amounts of evaporation and of tributary waters. In going from o 0 to 15° centigrade, pure water expands only about three-fourths of a one-thousandth part of the original bulk Of depth, while sea water having a density of l .028 at o 0 , has a density of 1.026 at 15°. ·

CHAPTER IX.
SEICHES IN LAKES, BAYS, ETC.

126. The problem of seiches in variously-shaped bodies of water is one of peculiar interest to the mathematician because it presents analytical difficulties which have not been overcome save in -a few simple cases. The problem is to find the free periods and natural modes of oscillation for given bodies of water.· No attempt will be made here to go into an elaborate mathematical treatment of the subject. Chapters III and IV, Part IV A, show how to ascertain oscillations in square, triangular, and circular areas whether the uniform depth be very small in comparison with a wave length or not. A few questions relating to long-wave motion in bodies of variable depth are briefly considered in Chapter IV. A number of experimental tests are described in Chapter V of the same part. For a rectangular body t A. in length, the period -r of the slowest oscillation is given by the equation

· The stationary wave in a canal communicating with a tided sea is found by writing b, h, or both, as functions of x.

Peter White and William Watson,t and applied to lakes Earn and Treig in Scotland by himself and E. Madagan-Wedderburn t. The computed periods of Loch Earn are 14.50, 8.14, 5.74 minutes and for Loch Treig, 9.09, 5.07, 3.59, the corresponding observed quantities are 14.55, 8.ro, - - - , 9.18, 5.15, - - - . Professor Chrystal considers small longitudinal oscillations in a body of water whose depth, h(x), cross section, A(x), ~nd surface breadth, b(x), vary slowly from point to point. As is usually done in treatment of long-wave motion, the vertical acceleration is here neglected. If v denotes the surface area extending fromx =o to x=x, <r(v), a function of v, known from the given body of water, viz. A (x) b(x); and n, the natural seiche frequency; then n is. determined by the equation.

Integrating by series, two new transcendents for each sign are encountered. He calls those obtained when the upper sign is used seiche-cosine and seiche-sine, and when the lower, hyperbolic seicke-cosine and hyperbolic seicke-sine. If w is small, the above equation approximates (333) If c= 1, this is satisfied by cos w, or sin w; if c=-1, by cos h w, or sin h w. · The seiche-cosine and seiche-sine functions apply to lakes whose longitudinal section is concave along the bottom, and the hyperbolic forms to convex bottoms. While the assumed form of O"( v) may appear t.o be very special. Professor Chrystal shows how, by properly combining the simple geometrical bodies permitting of treatment, good approximations r.an frequently be made to lakes which at first sight would defy analysis.

For a lake with one end vertical, and shelving to zero depth at the other end, the periods of the secondary oscillations in terms of the period of the principal, are found to be 0.5462, o'.3767, 0.2883, etc.; while the distances of the corresponding nodal lines from the vertical end are in terms of the lake length, 0.6057; 0.3809, 0.8825; 0.3763, 0.7056, 0.9441. The corresponding period ratios for a parabolic lake are found to be 0.577, 0.408, 0.316, 0.258, 0.218, etc., and for a semiparabolic lake, 0.548, 0.378, 0.289, 0.234, 0.196, etc. Professor Chrystal concludes his paper in the Transactions (Vol. LXI, III) with an important bibliography of the subject.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

A review of Chrystal's work is given by Dr. W. Halbfass.* Mr. D. Isitani ascertains" the change of period due to a slight alteration in the area and volume of the oscillating liquid."t Mr. T. Terada shows analytically "that any contraction or expansion at the middle part of the canal prolongs or shortens its natural period respectively, and that at the end shortens or prolongs it respectively." He tests his work experimentally and also by application to Lake Hakone. In order to show the relative periods of bodies having the same total lengths, I performed the following experiment: A box 9 inches square on· the inside was partitioned off by a portion in the manner indicated in the diagram. When the depth of water was 2 inches the observed number of periods a minute in the .two parts were 91 and 63!. The calculated number for a rectangular area 9 inches long is 86. The respective periods are, therefore, in seconds o.66, 0.94!, 0.70. Hence the period of the area narrow at the middle, is one-third greater than the period of a rectangular area of the same length.

I 29. Classification of seiches. So far only completely surrounded bodies of water have been considered in reference to seiche movements. But it is not diffiNo. 26. cult to see that bodies having incomplete boundaries may also possess free oscillations 4.5 4 having periods 'suited to their dimensions (Cf. sec. 29, Part IV A). As a rule the more broken the boundary, the smaller will be the amplitude of the motion, ca:teribus paribus. The existence of fractional oscillating areas is not so obvious; but it will be shown that 9 ·I the seiches due to them are common and important. For convenience, seiche movements may be divi<;led into the classes mentioned below. The names of these classes generally refer to the forms of the bodies or areas in which the 4.() 4 seiche is produced, and, as a rule, scarcely, require formal definition.

The most common cause of these periodic movements is the wind. blowing over the bodies of water in which they occur. The sudden variations in barometric pressure may cause seiches in lakes and other nearly inclosed bodies of water. Earthquakes frequenpy produce seiches along the coast and in maritime harbors by means of the disturbance transmitted through the sea. By "strait-and-harbor" seiche is meant an irregular oscillation caused by reflections of disturbances between irregular or nonparallel shores, lying generally only a few miles asunder. The markings on a tide curve resembles· irr~ular saw teeth. An example of such a body is the Golden Gate, California. The seiches Qelonging to the last two classes.are generally found along open coasts. The tide curves from certain places contain at times quite regular oscillations, and from most places irregular saw-teeth markings whenever a considerable disturbance takes place, such as that produced by an earthquake or a strong wind. The regular oscillations are generally formed in a cul-de-sac or small bay suddenly terminated. The irregular ones are formed where the sea bottom is shelv:ing and where the lengths, and so the periods, of the fractional areas are not as fixed as are those in the case just referred to. As will be presently pointed out, the oscillating strip of water in these two cases is about 1 A long; and so the more definite its boundary, the more perfect the oscillation. A familiar illustration "is a steam or air whistle closed at one end. · The jet of steam or air forced across or into the mouth of the whistle causes the contained column of fluid, which is 1 A in length, to be thrown into a state of intense vibration in accordance with the well known principle of resonance. If the form of the interior of the resonator were not tolerably simple, the tones given out would be less certain, and would to a certain extent be selected in accordance with the intensity of the blast. Suppose that a suspended pendulous body be exposed to the action of the wind. It will be found_ to oscillate almost incessantly, and in its own period, because the impinging current of air is not exactly uniform. So, under favorable conditions, a seiche of this kind may exist for days at a time, sustained by the variable action of the wind upon the oscillating arm of water and the larger body with which it is connected, the effect upon the latter being probably of greater importance. Experiment No. I.-Take a glass tube, open at both ends, about 20 inches long and one-half inch in diameter. Mark a point distant one-fourth of the length of a second's pendulum from the lower end of the tube. Immerse the tube up to this mark in a tank of water. By suction elevate a column of water, and then suddenly release it. The column will perform oscillations having a period of one second and a continually decreasing amplitude. T he following are the elevations or amplitude in inches as found by experiment beginning with th~ first elevation occurring after letting go the column sustain.ed by suction; the values in parentheses are the ratios of neighboring values: 4, (0.55), 2.20, (0.64), i.40, (0.66),0.93, (0.69), 0.64, (0.67),0.43, (0.70),0.30, (0.77),0.23, (0.74), 0.17. From the nature of the case it is difficult to determine these quantities with precision; but they show that the amplitude decreases somewhat more slowly as it becomes smaller. If no attention is paid to the amplitude, it is easy to so time the sustaining suction impulses imparted from time to time that the natural period of oscillation shall be but little interferred with. In this way the number of oscillations per minute can be found with considerable accuracy (say to I per cent). The result will be 6o oer minute very nearly.*

Experiment No. 2.-Take a trough of rectangular cross section closed at one end, about 20 inches iong, and containing a movable partition whereby various lengths can be readily secured. Place this in a tank of water so that the depth in the trough is from a fraction of an inch at the head to 2 inches at the mouth. By giving the water off the mouth of the trough an horizontal impulse, an oscillation will take place in the trough, which will continue for a few periods. These oscillations can be sustained by subsequent impulses, care being taken to not disturb the regularity of the motion. The period of the oscillation will be found to be approximately

Since the period of a rectangular lake whose depth decreases uniformly from the center to either end is nearly equal to what it would have been had the depth been constant and equal to its average depth, the period of an arm of water becoming shallow near the end must differ but little from the period calculated upon the assumption of a constant depth equal to its mean depth (see sec. 1 27). 130.

ef lake seiches.

Dr. Forel was the first person to make an extensive and careful study of seiche phenomena ( 1876-1885). He found that Lake Geneva, upon whose northern shore he resided, had both longitudinal and transverse oscillations, and that the former often possessed more than a single nodal line; in fact, the record was far from being simple in character. The periods of the longitudinal seiches were found to be 73 and 35 minutes, and the period of the transverse seiche about 10 minutes. These periods agree fairly well with those computed by the simple formula r=twice length of lake+-Jgh.

He devised and used a delicate form of tide gauge which he styled "limnimeter"
(i\.lµv17= pool).

A list of Forel's papers on this subject is given by Darwin in his book entitled "The Tides and Kindred Phenomena in the Solar System," end of Chapter II; also by Chrystal, in the bibliography already alluded to. Numerous modes of oscillation in the small lake Chiemsee, southern Bavaria, have been recently investigated and the corresponding periods carefully determined by A. Endros.* In a paper issued by the· U. S. Weather Bureau entitled "Wind Velocity and Fluctuations of Water Level on Lake Erie," Prof. AlfredJ. Henry finds the theoretic.:al period of the lake to be 18 hours, while observations made at B.uffalo and Amherstburg indicate an actual period of 14 hours or a little more. t In a note in the Monthly Weather Review t I have called attention to the shortening of the free period due to the narrowing ends of the lake and to the fact that actual depth is somewhat in excess o( that used by Professor Henry. In fact, in a sharply-pointed convex lake, such as might be bounded by the lines of motion shown in Fig. 9, Part IV A, the period would be l/-.,/2=0.707 times the period of a rectangular body having as length the extreme length of the lake. The mea,n between the period given on this assumption and that given by the assumption of a rectangular body is 14?4' hours, the length of the body in either case being 214 sea miles and the mean depth IO fathoms. The period of the longitudinal seiche of Lake Ontario is said to be four hours and forty-nine minutes.§ As will be noted in section 136, Lapham in 1852 observed oscillations at Milwaukee having a period of 2 hours, which is the theoretical period of an east-and-west oscillation across Lake Michigan. The average depth of Lake Pontchartrain, La., is 14 feet. Calling the virtual length 30 miles and the width 20 miles, the two periods obtained for Table 50 are
30 12 .57 20 = 2.4 hours and-·· ·-= r.6 hours. 12.5 7 .

No regular seiches occur in this lake; Fig. 27 is given to show that a southeasterly wind may make the lake uncommonly low at New Orleans (West End), while it is uncommonly high at Pass Manchac, and vice versa; similarly for a northwest wind. Moreover, it shows a very rough oscillation at times with a period of about 2 hours. In 1885 se~ches were observed on Lake George, New South Wales, Australia, and described by H. C. Russell in his anniversary address.** They were found to have a period of 2 hours, very nearly. This is nearly the theoretical period for a longitudinal uninodal oscillation of a body having the length of the lake and a depth equal to the lake's mean depth.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

One of the most regular seiches known occurs at times upon Lake Chiuzenji, a small lake in Japan. It was observed by Mr. K. Honda in 19o6, by aid of two limnimeters of his own design.* He placed an instrument at each end of the lake and found low water at one end when it was high water at the other, and the period to be 7.70 minutes. The curves on the record are nearly perfect sine curves. By trial he found a point near the middle of the northern shore of the lake where the pencil of the limnimeter traced a straight line. The simple formula giving too short a period, Mr. Honda constructed a model of the lake and by means of it found the period of the lake to be 7.68 minutes. It seems probable that the period of the lake is slightly in excess of the period of a rectangular lake of the same length because of the somewhat dumb-bell shape of the la:ke.

Examples of open-lake seiches.

The celebrated tidal currents in the Euripus are chiefly due to the seiches in the Gulf of Talanta. The principal oscillation of the gulf has an observed period of 1! hours and a range of 6 inches or less. This period agrees fairly well with computation. The extreme length of the gulf is 54 miles, the average depth 52 fathoms. These dimensions imply a period of 1.8 hours. The fact that at some points of this gulf the period of the oscillation is but little more than one hour indicates that a binodal seiche also exists. The oscillation in Narragansett Bay is remarkable in that the 10 miles extending from Providence to Bristol (the average depth being 2t fathoms) has a seiche of the binodal type, while the 10 miles extending from Bristol to Newport (the average depth being 11 fathoms) has one of the uninodal type. This is as it should be when depths are considered. By Table 50 the period of the binodal part is 0.77 hour and of the uninodal 0.74 hour. . ' · Fig. 28 shows the period to be 0.75 hour. It shows that the oscillation is in approximately like phases at Providence and Bristol, while at B.ristol and Newport the phases are nearly opposite. At Weeks, Louisiana, an imperfect seiche in Vermillion Bay and of considerable amplitude occurs during heavy winds. The observed period is about 3 hours; the period of two hours ·may be occasionally observed. The average depth of the bay is 8 feet. The virtual length is about 15 miles and virtual breadth about 10 miles. These dimensions give as periods

depth at a mean stage of the tide is st foet; these dimensions give 1.27 hours for the free period of the body. By means of the ch~nnel along the city front the oscillation · is propagated to Fort Point. At Wellington, New Zealand, the observed period of the seiche oscillation is 28 minutes. The length of the harbor in a northeasterly and southwesterly direction is 6! miles and in a northwesterly and southeasterly direction 5 miles. The average depth for either direction is 10 fathoms. The computed period of the first is 30 minutes and of the second 23 minutes. Hence, it is probable that the seiche extends in a northeasterly and southwesterly direction; the period may be somewhat less than 30 minutes because the virtual length of an oval body is less than its extreme length and.because the depth increases gradually for some distance from the shores. A few small oscillations are shown upon the tide-record for Williamstown, Port Phillip, published in connection with the Krakatoa eruption. This body is 33 miles long in a north-and-south direction, its average depth being about 10 fathoms. The period of a binodal seiche in a rectangular body of these dimensions is 1.27 hours. On account of the oval shape of Port Phillip this value should be shortened somewhat. Observation seems to give about 1.20 hours for the period. An east-and-west seiche would have a slightly greater period, but it is probable that this could hardly be felt at Williamstown. However, the irregularity of the observed period indicates that either the mode of oscillation is not fixed or two or more motions coexist. 132. Examples of parallel-wall seiches. On November 1, 1870, during a severe storm, a series of seiches were observed at Fiume, Austria.* Their average period was 2.7 hours and the maximum range about 1 foot. Now, the open portion of the Adriatic just below the bay upon which Fiume is situated is 67 sea miles in width; the depth is about 30 fathoms. This gives, by Table 50, 2.9 solar hours as the free period of a uni~odal seiche. Seiches have been observed at Ischia, by G. Grablovitz,r having an average period of 13f minutes and an average maximum range of perhaps 0.2 foot. The oscillating strip of water may be assumed to extend from the coast of Ischia to the middle of the opposing coast of Porcida. This distance is 2 .6 miles; and the mean depth 9 fathoms. These dimensions give 0.211hour=12.7 minutes as the period of the uninodal oscillation. The eruption of .Krakatoa, on August 27, 1883, produced a great disturbance in the waters of Sunda Strait, which was transmitted through the narrow part of the strait, and recorded <1n the tide gauge at Tandjong Priok, Batavia. Here the maximum range of the seiche was over 6 feet; the period was 2.20 -hours.t The calculated period for uninodal seiche across the broad portions of Sunda ·Strait in a northwesterly and northeasterly direction ~s about 2.2 hours. The tide curve at Tutticorn, Gulf of Manar, has at times an oscillation whose period is 3 hours and range about 0.5 foot.§ The distance across the gulf at this place is 92

miles, and the average depth of the upper end of the gulf may be taken as 55 fathoms. These values give a period of 3 hours. 133· Examples of cul-de-sac seiches. The seiches at Malta are described by Airy in the Philosophical Transactions.* He finds the average observed period to be 21 minutes; the range to vary from nothing to a little more than r foot. The body of water responsible for this seiche he considers to be the deep arm of the sea lying between Sicily and Tunis, the shoals playing only a subordinate part. From Figure 37, Pa.rt IV A, it is evident that the period of the transverse oscillation might vary from 1 to 2 or even more hours according to the amount of shoal water included in the estimate. Hence it is difficult to say how many nodal lines are present when the period of the oscillation is 21 minutes. Their number may be anywhere from 3 to 7.t As Valetta, the place of observation, is situated upon the northeastern coast of the island, while the area in which the seiche arises in accordance with this hypothesis lies mainly to the west of the island, Airy says, "Such waves, once created, would be propagated to regions of the sea somewhat beyond those in which they are formed." It seems probable that these oscillations are caused by the configuration cif the harbor. For, the length of the harbor is 1.6 miles, and, if we call the average depth 6! fathoms, the period of the dependent oscillation would be 4 X :u-th = 0.31 hour= r 8 minutes. Tidal observations made at St. Thomas Island, West Indies, show that oscillation is going on in the harbor most of the time. The most regular ones have a period of 0.45 hour and a range varying from 0.5 foot to nothing-it generally being 0.1 or ~.2 foot. At times there is an oscillation whose period is about 0.7 hour. The harbor is about 1.3 miles long, measuring from the head to the capes at the mouth. The average depth is 3! fathoms. This gives 4X d-:h=o.34 hour for the period of the oscillation. The broadening of the harbor near the head, and the contraction near the mouth due to Rupert Rock, must cause the period to be somewhat greater than the one just calculated. It is probable that the arm of water taken as fA. does really extend outside of the mouth of the harbor proper. The less perfect oscillation having a period of 0.7 hour may be caused by the strip of shallow water lying between St. Thomas Island, West Indies, and deep water to the south. The width of this strip is 8 miles and the average deptb 20 fathoms. This gives 4X:d.B=o.9 hour. ~ The seiches in St. John Harbor, an arm of the ·Bay of Fundy, has been briefly described by W. Bell Dawson t and more fully by A. W. Duff, the point of observation of the latter being a short distance above the narrows.§ Duff gives 42.2 minutes as the length of the average period of the oscillations. Off St. John the bay is 32 miles wide. The average depth being 40 fathoms, it might be concluded from Table 50 that the period of the uninodal seiche is 1 .23 hours

and the period of the binodal 0.62 hour. Now it seems in this case to be highly improbable that a binodal seiche should occur across the bay and not one of the uninodal type; for surely the winds sweeping over the surface of the bay would act most favorably across its axis and so incite uninodal motion. Again, Dawson says: "These minor undulations often continue for a week at a time; or even longer." This accords well with the facts witnessed at Guanica and described in the next.paragraph. The harbor at St. John is 3.3 miles long from its head just south of the narrows to its mouth east of the northern part of Partridge Island. The average depth at half-tide level may be taken as 8 fathoms. These dimensions give as the period 4 X i"!J-,- = 0.567 hour, or 34 minutes. At the bend in this arm depths of more than 20 fathoms occur, while near Partridge Island the depth of the channel is only 5 fathoms at half-tide level. These circumstances must increase the length of the period. Remarkably regular seiches occur in Guanica Harbor. The observed period is 45 minutes, and the range varies from 1 to 4 inches. So persisten~ is this phenomenon that as many as 60 consecutive oscillations have been noted. (See Figure 30.) That the phenomenon at Guanica does not depend upon a trinodal seiche across the Caribbean Sea is proved by the fact that no indication of a seiche having a period of 45 minutes occurs at Ponce or at Guayanilla. The length of this harbor is 2 miles and the average depth 3- fathoms. The period of a rectangular dependent arm of these dimensions is, by Table 50, 4 X T"i"~H = 0.55 hour. This period must be increased by one-third part of itself in order to agree with the observed value. The average width of the harbor is at least one and one-half times its width at the narrowest part near the mouth. This fact increases the period somewhat, but is partially offset by the increase in depth at the narrows. It seems probable that the oscillating arm of water extends some distance outside of the harbor proper, thus increasing the size and period of the body. Port Real is a body of water o.8 mile long and 1t fathoms deep. Here a fairly regular seiche occurs, having a period of 0.62 hour and a maximum range of generally 0.2 feet. A rectangular tongue of water would have for its critical period 4 X T-&'h= 0.32 hour. Near the. entrance to this harbor the distance across the channel, counting from the 1-fathom line, is only one-twelfth of a mile, while the breadth within the capes, counting from this same contour, is two-thirds of a mile. It seems probable that the period for the actual body should be perhaps double that of the rectangular body- just alluded to. The oscillation does not persist as long as the one at Guanica; still as many as sixteen consecutive periods may at times be observed. Edgartown Light-House, 'Massachusetts, is situated near the head of a bay bounded by land on one side and land and shoals on the other. This 'a.rm of· water is 3 miles long and 4 fathoms deep on the average. These dimensions give for the .critical period 4 X n~n = o. 73 hour. Observation shows that when a strong northwest wind is blowing, a seiche may arise having a period of three-fourths of an hour and continuing for several hours. · The undulations in the tide curve at Colon on August 27..... 28, 1883, do not seem to have been connected with the Krakatoa eruption; for, they are remarkably regular

and occur too early for allowing a reasonable time for the disturbance to be propagated around South Africa. The observed period of this oscillation is r. 17 hours. On September 6-7, 1882, the tide curve showed an earthquake disturbance. There were apparently two oscillations thus set up, the period of the first being i.17 hours and of the second 0.40 hour; the maximum ranges being i.3 feet and 0.5 foot, respectively. On June 15 and again on June 17, 1883,a good oscillation, having a period of r.17 hours and a range of 0.2 or 0.3 foot, is recorded on the tide curve. The form of the western portion of Carribean Sea is not favorable tq seiche oscillations, even if such were possible in a sea of such great depth. Turning to the harbor of Colon, we find its length to be 4 miles ·and its average depth 2t fathoms. The resulting period is therefore 4 X 13 ~ 4 = 1. 17 hours. At Dutch Harbor, Alaska, observations show a seiche having a period of about one-half hour. The extreme length of lliuliuk Bay, of w_hich Dutch Harbor is a branch, is 4! miles. The average depth is about 15 fathoms. These dimensions give, by Table 50, a p~riod of 4 X 3 = 0.565 hour= 34 minutes. At Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, the period of a regular sine-like .fluctuation, groups of which appear .from time to time, is 0.43! hour or 26 minutes. The larger ones are caused by earthquake sea waves, but the smaller ones may be due to meteorological disturbances. The following are some of the earthquakes whose observed effects had very nearly the above period: Krakatoa, August 27, 1883; Northern Japan, June 15, 1896; Ecuador, January 31, 1906; and Valparaiso, Chile, August 16, 1906. The ma.Xi.mum range, depending upon the intensity of the disturbance at Honolulu, varies from o. 1 foot to 0.4 foot. · Assuming that the dependent body at Honolulu Harbor is 1i miles long and 2;

:.k

fathoms deep on an average, the computed period is 4X 13.01 _!_f_ =0.42 hour. Following the Krakatoa eruption, irregular oscillations, having a period of 2.6 hours and a maximum range o( 2t feet, were observed at Lyttleton, New Zealand. The length of Port Cooper is 8l miles, and average depth 2t fathoms. The resulting period is therefore 4 X ~ = 2'.54 hours. 13.ot At Olongapo, Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, a seiche, having a period of r.3 hours and range of about 9 inches, has been observed; also smaller undulations having a period of from one-third to one-half an hour. The former can hardly be due to an oscillation of the greater part of China Sea lying between Luzon and Siam and Hainan Island; for, although a trinodal east-and-west seiche has a computed period of about rt hours, no oscillation of such period is to be found at Manila. Now the length of "Subic Bay is 10 miles and its average depth 18 fathoms. Regarding this bay as a dependent arm, the period computed by Table 50 is 4 X ~~8 = r.09 hours. By supposing the line marking the mouth of the bay to be convex, the length of the bay.may be increased to 11 or 12 miles. The computed period of the east-andwest oscillation of Subic Bay at Olongapo is 0.3 hour and in a southeast-and-northwest direction 0.4 hour.

A seiche was observed at Aden, Arabia, as a result of the Krakatoa eruption, the period being 1.02 hours and the maximum range of about o.8 foot. Small undulations of this period may sometimes be seen on the tide curve for this station.* Aden Harbor is about l .8 miles long, measuring from the mouth to the low-water line at the head. It is 0.4 mile broad at the mouth and 2! miles at its broadest part. The average depth is l! fathoms. A rectangular am1 I.8 miles long and l! fathoms deep has as its period 4 X ,;'.~·~8 = 0.71 hour. For the actual harbor the period must be considerably greater than.0.71 hour and may approach the observed value.t 134· Examples of shelving seiches. The larger earthquake oscillations at San Francisco must be due to the shelving shore outside and not to any oscillation of the bay, for, the disturbance resulting from the earthquake at Arica, Chile (May 9, 1877), and which reached California early on the following day, arrived at Fort Point about 7 minutes earlier than at Sausalito. This is about the difference whicl] the depths between these two stations might imply. There is a tolerably close resemblance between the·records upon the tide gauges at the two places. The maximum range of this disturbance is about l foot, and the irregular periods vary from 0.3 hour to an hour or more. The saw-teeth-like disturbance having an average period of three or four minutes and which frequently occur during and after heavy westerly winds are, as already stated, due to irregular reflections across the Golden Gate and so belong to another class of seiches. · The disturbance caused by the Krakatoa eruption was well marked at Negapatam, Madras, False Point, Beypore, Port Elizabeth, and Table Bay. The resulting oscillations, although very irregular, may be said to have the following respective· periods and maximum ranges: LS, I.4, 2.8, 1.1, 1.1, 1.0 hours, and I.5, 0.5, i.6 1 1.2,4.5, i.5 feet. These periods are too short for permitting the assumption that all of the shallow water along. the continental shelf forms a stationary wave fA. in length. It seems probable that more or less of the water will partake of such motion at a given station according as the intensity 6f the disturbing force varies. The very uniformity of the slope of the bottom in these regions of shallow water must militate against the existence of definite oscillating arms of water; hence, the great variety of periods. and amplitudes at a given place of observation. · Shelving seiches are by far the most common of all. Every considerable earthquake disturbance of the water of the ocean produces them in nearly all parts of a shelving coast. When caused by winds, their appearance is less striking, in that their

amplitude is generally less and the tendency to periodicity less evident. The record of these may ther. be likened to irregular saw-teeth. In regular broad and open bays their size and regularity are increased, e. g., the Krakatoa disturbance is much greater and more seiche-like at Port Elizabeth than at Table Bay. At Galle, Ceylon, the tide curves contain at times minute oscillations less regular than a cul-de-sac seiche, but more regular than a shelving seiche.* The period fs about 0.4 hour and the range about 0.1 foot. The bay or harbor is broad and open, but does not extend far inland. Hence, it is natural to expect a case lying bet~een the two kinds just mentioned. The harbor helps in making the seiche definite, but because of its openness the outside water forms a large part of the fractional oscillating area.

CHAPTER X.
TIDES IN LAKES AND WELLS.

136. Tides in lakes or inlarui seas.

Passing over the tides of the eastern portion of the Mediterranean Sea which were familiar to the ancienti; and which have been already considered in this' manual, it may be noted here that Daniel Bernoulli in Chapter XI of his "Traite sur le Flux et Reflux de la Mer" was the first to attempt to compute the tides on inland seas. (See sec. 94, Part I.) E. B. Barlow in his book entitled" An Exact Survey of the Tide" (1717) mentions the existence of semidaily tides in Lake Huron, and thus speaks of the tides of Lake Superior:
Moreover, the French report of the Upper Lake, which lies to the N. IVest of this, and falls into the same River; that notwithstanding it is situated five hundred Fathoms above the Superficies of the Sea, and lies at two hundred and seventy leagues distant from it; yet it Floods to two, three, and· four Foot in Height; which plainly shews, that these Tumours proceed absolutely from the Moon's Pressure, without the Intermediation of the Ocean to raise 'em by \vay of Libration, at so great a Distance from the Sea, and exalted so many Fathoms above it.

Early letters and discussions relating to the tides in the Great Lakes of North America are given by Gen. H. A. S. Dearborn upon pages 78 et seq., Volume XVI (1829), American Journal of Sciences and Arts. Dearborn says: ·
The phenomenon appears to ·have attracted the attention of Fra Marquette in 1673, of Baron Hon tan in 1689, of Charlevoix in 1721.

Maj. Sarni.tel A. Storrow observed in Green Bay in the year 1817 a fluctuation of the water surface having a range of .from 5 to 8 inches and a half period of 1 l or l 2 hours. Schoolcraft (about 1820) concludes that there are no regular tides in the lakes, but that the observed fluctuations are meteorological in character. Dr. Joseph Lovell in 1827 expresses a similar view. Capt. Henry Whiting, U. S. A., observed the tides upon a graduated staff in Green Bay from June l to 6, 1819. He says:
The height of the rise and fall, was from twelve to eighteen inches. Both the ebb and flow were very sudden, and in thai: respect deviate from the general character of the tides. It was seldom more than an hour, in attaining its height, and· was generO:lly as rapid in making the descent, though several hours would often intervene between the changes.

In his letter dated September 11, l 827, he expresses his conviction that the Green Bay tides are due to the winds. Capt. Greenleaf Dearborn, U. S. A., mentions that while stationed at the outlet of Lake Superior, tides having a range of about 18 inches and a time of rising or falling of 2! to 2~ hours were observed.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

In a paper entitled "Remarks on the supposed tides, and periodical rise and fall of the North America Lakes,"*Maj. Henry Whiting expresses (p. 212) a belief that an astronomical tide must exist, but that it must be very small. He gives Gover~or Cass's observations made in 1828 (July 15 to August 29, generally 4 times daily) on Fox River, Green Bay. Governor L. Cass thus comments upon his observations:
The slightest inspection will satisfy you, that the changes in the elevation of the water a're entirely too variable to be traced to any regular permanent cause; and that consequently there is no perceptible tide at Green Bay, which is the result of observation.

Lieut. D. Ruggles, in an article entitled "Tides in the North American Lakes," t gives some history of the subject and expresses the belief that the tide can not well be detected from observations made, say, four times ~aily (as was the case \vith those made in 1828), and so he causes hourly observations to be made for one week at Green Bay in 1836. It seems doubtful whether or not he really detected any tide, for his observations indicate oscillations of a foot or two. Upon page 130 of his book entitled "Wisconsin: Its geography and topography, history, geology, and min,eralogy" (20 ed. Milwaukee, 1846), l\fr. Increase A. Lapham says:
The question whether there is a regular tide on the lakes, still remains undecided. That there are strong and variable currents in Lake Michigan has been known ever since the days of Hennepin.

In l 849 Lapham kept a meteorological journal, in which he gives the height of Lake Michigan five times daily and referred his readings to the city datum. Whether or not he really detected an astronomical tide from these observations is uncertain. He, however, believed that he did, as can be seen from his statements in an appendix to_ Charles Whittlesey.'s paper, page 447, American Journal of Sciences and Arts, Volume XXVII (1859). However this may be, he subsequently obtained hourly readings day and night from September 14 to November 14, 1852. This record is in the office of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. From these it is possible to determine the tide, as has been done in section 137; but no work of Lapham's appears to be extant which might prove that he detected the true tide. A plotting of the hourly readings clearly shows the transverse seiche at Milwaukee, with a period of almost exactly two hours-which is the theoretical time of such oscillation-and a range of 0.2 foot. · A paper by Major Lachlan entitled "On the periodical rise and fall of the lakes" appears in the American Journal of Sciences and Arts, Volume XIX (1855), pages 60-71, 164-175, and Volume XX (1855), pages 45-53. On pages 63 et seq., Volume XIX, is an historical account of the subject. On page 168 he quotes an extract from a report by Colonel Whittlesey for l 838-39, in which Whittlesey strongly contends that observations fail to show any astronomical tide in Lake Erie. Lachlan comes to the conclusion (Vol. XX., p. 51) that "a long, regular course of minute observations" is necessary to settle the question of tides in lakes. At the close of the paper (Vol. XX, p. 53) the editors refer to an important paper by Whittlesey (1851), which goes to show that the fluctuations are not periodical. Major Lachlan also discusses the annual and other variations in lake level.

CURRENTS, SHALLOW,WATER TIDES, ETC.

Col. J. D. Graham, in an article entitled "Investigation of the problem regarding the existence of a lunar tidal wave on the great fresh-water lakes of North America,"* finds from six months of half· hourly readings, the spring range on Lake Michigan at Chicago, to be 0.25 foot, the mean range o. 15 foot, and the mean lunitidal interval to be 30 minutes. He says:
This result was announced in my annual report to the Topographical Bureau of the War Department on the 15th of November, 1858, and also before the Chicago Historical Socjety at its annual meeting on the 30th of that month.

This discovery is referred to on page 127, Volume 37 (1859), Journal Franklin Institute. The later work of Colonel Graham is discussed by Ferrel, "Tidal researches," pages 250-255, who finds for the values of approximately the same quantities-0.21 foot, o. 14 foot, and 32 minutes, respectively. In the American Journal of Sciences and Arts, Volume XXVII (1859), pages 305-310, Charles \Vhittlesey reviews observations made by Mr. Underwood in 1.858 at Green Bay, but he does not believe the tide on Lake Michigan yet discovered. On page 447 of the same volume is a note or appenpix to Mr. Whittlesey's paper in which I. A. Lapham states that he detected (and announced in 1849) a tide from observations made every three hours during the month of August, 1849. Also, that subsequent hourly observations made day and night for two months fully confirmed this conclusion. In this note Whittlesey mentions Colonel Graham's discovery of the tide in 1858, as chronicled in the proceedings of the Chicago Historical Society for the meeting of November 30, 1858. . It will be noticed that. the earlier attempt at finding a lake tide failed because fluctuations many times greater than the astronomical tide were invariably mistaken for it, and also because continuous hourly readings were seldom undertaken. The justice of Lapham's claim to the discovery of a lake tide must depend upon what values he may have obtained for its range and interval. In the Annual Report of the Survey of the Northern and Northwestern Lakes for 1872, by .Maj. C. B. Comstock, is given on pages 9-14 a discussion of the tides at Milwaukee. · A self-registering gauge was there maintained for several years, and portions of the record from 1867 to 1871 are discussed. Judging from the diagrams, Plates I-III, M2 =0.0395, S2 =0.018, and S2 + M~=o.045 foot, and the lunitidal interval, 30 minutes. The tabular values on page 12 of this report, when harmonically analyzed give M2 =0.0340 ft., M~ 0 = 19°.46; S2 =0.0154ft., S 2°= 26°.43. In discussing these tides, the writer ascertains the theoretical equilibrium tide at Chicago and Milwaukee. These applications of the equilibrium theory, especially to the results obtained from observations by Colonel Graham at Chicago, constitute the first instance in the history of tides where the forces and tides have been rationally connected. But in this case the writer obtains a result twice as great as the equilibrium value, from an erroneous assumption concerning the kinetic energy in the tides of the lake. In the next year's report of the Lake Survey, pages 28 and 30, and Plates I and II, are g~ven similar results from observations at Duluth; but no theoretical considerations are introduced. An analysis of the tabular values on page 30, gives M2 = o.o643 ft., Mi 0 = 64°.45; S2 =0.036oft.; S2°=85°.75. ----- ------------------*Report A. A. A. S., 1860, pp. 52-6o.

The no-tide point of Lake Superior (center of gravity of the surface, section 49, Part II), is 9 statute miles north of Keweenaw Point. The latitude. and longitude of the no-tide point are about 47° 32' N ., 87° 43' W. By means of this section, or preferably by means of sections 1-4, Part IV A, it is readily seen that the values in this table agree well, as a rule, with the corrected equilibrium theory; but see section 2 l. The observations at Milwaukee are hourly readings made by I. A. Laphan; those at Marquette and Duluth are taken from records of self-registering gauges maintained by' the United States Army Engineers. The large size of the tide at Chicago and Milwaukee indicates-the stationaqr-wave motion of sec. 2 1. The values of Mf and Mf 0 given in section 124 agree tolerably well with the theoretical values given in Table 37. . · . So far as semidaily, daily, or fortnightly forces are concerned the earth behaves nearly as a rigid body. But according to a publication of the Royal Prussian Geodetic Iilstitute, New Series, No. 30, 1907, 0. Hecker finds from observations upon a horizontal pendulum some yielding of the earth to the tidal forces.
138. Tides in wells or springs.

Pliny the Elder calls attention to wells in Spain that ·rise and fall with the tide of the ocean and to those which rise and fall contrary to iL (Sec. 69, Part I, this manual). Barlow on pages 30-32, First Treatise, of his "Exact Survey of the Tides," places little or no credence in the possibility of intermittent ~prings being influenced by tht rise and fall of the ocean tide. On pages 308 and 309 of Volume IV of his Astronomie, Lalande. makes mention of wells or springs which have periodic fluctuations. Some of these are simply intermittent springs; e.g., those described in Philosophical Transactions 1665, No. 7, and 1693, No. 204. According to the Admiralty Sailing Directions for the Pacific Islands, Volume Ill, wells of fresh water in Fanning Island rise and fall with the tide.

APPENDIX 6.

CURRENTS, SHALLOW-WATER TIDES, ETC.

A detailed account of a considerable number of tidal wells, is given by A. C. Veatch in Water-Supply and Irrigation Paper, No. 155, U.S. Geological Survey, 1906, entitled "Fluctuations of the Water Level in Wells, ·with Special Reference to Long Island, New York," He finds the tide in the wells of the locality considered to be due to the periodic deformation of a clay layer immediately above the water-bearing stratum, the deformation being caused by the varying weight of the ocean tide above. The effect is a maximum at the low-water line and decreases with the distance from the shore. The lag of the tide in the well upon the ocean tide varies from a few minutes at the shore to more than an hour at a few hundred feet inland. At the shore the range of the fluctuation may be a considerable fraction of the range of the ocean tide. The tidal oscillations in shallow wells along the sea shore he concludes to be generally due to the action of sea water upon the outflowing fresh water in the porous material into which the well is dug. The tides of the well may be behind those upon the outside by an interval of several hours. Upon page 67 is a bibliography of the subject.

Thus we see that the amount of disturbance of mean sea level due to a component, depends in general upon its initial phase, as well as upon its speed and amplitude. Consequently, if we have several components A, B, C, ... , a length T such that the disturbance shall be zero for assumed values of the initial phases a, (J, y, ... , this length will not give a zero disturbance for other assumed values of a, /J, y, ... .

'Hence The disturbance ef mean sea level under such assumed conditions that an improper length has the greatest possible effect, is independent ef the speed ef the component and is directly proportional to the error in length.

Hence The lengtli of sen'es giving the best value of sea level may be .found by Zl!eigliing the integral numbers of component periods (each multiple pen'od being nearly equal to r) according to the respective amplitudes. ·Because E1 is supposed to he a small quantity, we may write the general expression for the disturbance in the form

This equated to zero would give a time r' slightly different from the r' already found. We shall suppose r' to be determined by the foregoing rule, which weights the components according to their amplitudes. The periods of the several components expressed in mean solar days are given in the column headed\ Table c
I.

Let such multiples of these periods be taken as shall

490

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, HJ07.

give in each case very nearly 29 solar days. The exact times thus determined are to be multiplied by the respective amplitudes of the components. If we use the theoretical amplitudes as given. it1 Table 1, the above rule gives when M2 , S 2 , N 2 , v 2 ,_ L 2 , T 2 , 2~, µ 2 and K 1 , 0 1 , P 1 , Ql> are substituted in the formula,
T'=28.99 days.

The result remains sensibly the same when we use semidiurnals alone or diurnals alone. Thus we see that 29 days is almost an ideal period for the determination of mean sea level, so far as a period can be decided ii-respective of the time and locality. It may be remarked that although the above rule applies and gives r'=29 days, it does not follow that multiples of 29 days are the most accurate lengths which can be .selected. And this is so because the rule presupposes that, for any assumed length, the fractional portions of the component periods are very small, at least this should be the case with the larger components. In attempting to find suitable lengths of series, it is to be noted that, since S 2 is a comparatively large component, such lengths sho_uld not fall from a whole number of days or of half days. This consideration, taken in connection with some of the uncertainties attending the determination of r', seems to justify one in always cutting the series off at a whole number of days or of half days. Before attempting to actually find the leng~hs suitable for determining mean sea level, it is .best to prepare a table showing the value, in mean solar days, of multiples of various component days (and half days in case of semidiuruals), covering a period of a little more than one year. This having been done, the approximate lengths can be seen at once; for, the multiple periods of any component of considerable size must fall not far from the required times. Having found the approximate lengths, the formula for T' will be of assistance in determining the more exact values, or in discriminating between two nearly equal assumed values. The following are fairly sa,tisfactory lengths expressed in solar days: 29, 58, 87; rn4.5, 133.5, 162.5, 19r.5, 220.5, 249.5, 278.5; 297, 326, 355, 384 or 282, 311, 340, 369. Lengths approximately equal to 3 or 9 months are the most uncertain.
14.0. Effect

of one or more inequalities on.the observed range of tide.

An inequality in the tide can be represented by a curve resembling somewhat a curve of sines, The effect of the inequality will disappear if T be an exact multiple of its period. When this is not the case, the disturbance in the mean quantity due to the error in the length of series used depends upon the initial phase of the inequality. A given error in length will have the greatest effect when the initial phase is 0° or 180°. The inequality in height (range) and that in time (interval) should be separately considered. For, if the initial phase of the height inequality in a particular series were zero, the initial phase of the corresponding time inequality would be ± 90°. But for determining a suitable .length of a series we can assume in our calculations that the initial phase of the time inequality is also zero; in other words, that the disturbance due to error in length is the greatest possible.

Now each subordinate component B, C, . . . can be connected with an inequality whose period is its synodic period with A. Hence we have as a suitable length of series for determining the mean range of tide or the mean lunitidal interval

To simplify matters, assume the phases of B', C, . . . relative to A to be zero. The correction to the amplitude of A becomes, section 59, Part II. 0 A= -0

142: Rules for supplying missing portions

of a tidal or Hdal-current record.

Since it is advisable to assume no particular knowledge of the tide at a given locality, the r!Jles here laid down are designed to apply reasonably well to all stations, but somewhat better to those where the number of"the tides is govemed by the lunar semidiurnal constituent. Short gaps can be filled by repeating the preceding record, starting the repeated portion at the same phase of tide (higher high, lower low, etc.) as that which imme·

492

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907·

diately precedes the gap. In a similar way the curve can be extended across the gap from the record which follows. A mean between the two sets of values can then be used. In filling a gap more than a day or two in extent which may occur in a record several months long, advantage should be taken of the fact that the tidal forces, and so the tides, are after the lapse of certain intervals of time, nearly the same as before. Such intervals are 29, 191.5, 355, and 384 days. These are the times required for most of the inequalities to recur as nearly as may be; consequently, by making use of these intervals, all inequalities may be ignored and the missing tides inferred from the preceding (or following) record through the principal lunar constituent only. The length, 162.5 days, is less satisfactory. Periods approximately equal to the above lengths, but consisting of a whole number of half lunar days, are gi\·en here:

From these values there result the following rules, which apply to any form of tide or current record: Tides 29 days after a given date are the same as those of the given date, but occur 27 minutes earlier in the day. . · Tides 29 days before a given date are the same as those of the given date, but occur 27 minutes later in the day. Tides 191.5 days after a given date are the same as those of the given date, but occur 23 minutes earlier in the half day. Tides 191.5 days before a given date are the same as those of the given 'date, but occur 23 minutes later in tlie half day. A. M. tides on the earlier date will generally be P. M. tides on the later, and P. M. tides on the earlier date will generally be A. M. tides on the next day following the later date. Tides 355 days after a given date are the same as those on the given date, but occur 32 minutes later in the day. Tides 355 days before a given date are the same as those on the given date, but occur 32 minutes earlier in the day. Tides 384 days after a given date are the same as those on the given date, but occur 5 minutes later in the day. Tides 384 days before a given date are the same as those on the given date, but occur 5 minutes earlier in the day. Tides 162.5 days after a given date are the same as those of the given date, but occur 4 minutes later in the half day. Tides 162.5 days before a given date are the same as those of the given date, but occur 4 minutes earlier in the half day.

A.M. tides on the earlier date will generally be P.M. tides on the later, and P.M. tides on the earlier date will generally be A. M. tides on the next day following the later date. It is often convenient to take for the interpolated value the mean of the values occurring 29 days before and after the given date. As a practical test, the first of these rules was applied to the prediction& for San Francisco, Cal., as given in the Coast Survey Tide Tables for 1902. Comparison was made between the 112 tides there given for May 1-29 and those occurring 29 days later. The latter were found to occur on an average 26.62 minutes earlier in the day than the· former, the individual difference ranging from r to 55 minutes. The greatest difference between corresponding heights is.o.6 foot. · To facilitate the application of these rules, Table 57 has been prepared showing dates upon which the tide should be almost the same in time and height. In using these tables, care must be taken to properly allow for February 29 when this date occurs in the period considered. The table is for common years. 143. General rule .for inferring a component .from larger components. Let A and B denote two large components, both diurnals or both semidiurnals. The age of the inequality in the A tide due to the B wave is ·

The epoch of C, assuming the age of the C inequality is the same as of the B inequality, is
co=Ao+c-~ (Bo-Ao).

(347)

In particular

The amplitude may be taken as the theoretical percentage of B or of A or of A+ B. In particular, (see Table 1). [M 1]=0.079 0 1 or0.056 K 1 or 0.033 (K1 +01 ).
If c has very nearly the value a or b take C as the theoretical percentage of A or B (Table 1). If c has not very nearly the speed of either of these components, consider whether or not the period of the C inequality is equal to or commensurable with the period of the B inequality. If so, C can be taken as a fraction of B, even though c differs considerably from b. For example, the amplitude of L 2 can be better inferred as a fraction of the amplitude of M 2 or N 2 than of S 2 , although the speed of L 1 differs comparatively little from the speed of S 1 ·

144. Remarks on reductions and analyses. In section 74, Part II, it is explained bow the harmonic components may be obtained from observed 'high and low waters. In the method as there laid down some error is incurred because the period of the semidaily tide is not constant and because its amplitude, as there determined, is affected by the residual effect of the diurnal tide. This means that .the principal tide, l\f 2 , can not be well determined from the interpolated ordinates, and so must be inferred from a "first reduction." The smaller components, however, are well determined, as the example given in the section just referred to goes to show. The more correct expression for the range of the semidaily wave is (498), Part II. A few extra columns on the reduction sheet will enable one to make the correction for the effect of the daily tide.
No. 31.

For interpolating hourly ordinates, when the period of the tide varies from day to day, various schemes might be suggested, such as tables or several sets of sine curves. A convenient apparatus may be described as follows: Upon a sheet of drawing paper (tacked to a drawing board) draw a series of, say, 12 consecutive circles 0.2 inch apart, the radius of the inner circle being 6 inches. Let 3 solar hours represent a quadrant of the 4th (which is for a tidal day of just 24 solar hours) circle, counting the inmost circle as the first. Lay off from an initial diameter 1, 2, and 3 solar hours on either side. From the same initial diameter, but ·upon other circles, lay off distances such that the angles at the center shall not be o 0 , 30°, 90°, as before, but these angles multiplied by c2 1's2 where c2 is the hourly speed of the tide and 8 2 that of the component S 2 , or 30° per hour, c2 can be assumed to decrease uniformly in going outward from the inner circle (see Fig. 31).

APPENDIX 6.

The values used for the duration of a tide, and which should be written upon the cir.des, may range from, say, 5. 7 to 6.8 hours. Either way from the initial diameter the first hour should be divided into tenths to represent the tenths of hours in the times of occurrence of mean sea level of the semidaily tide. The hours are reckoned in either direction; they increase, say, from right to left for a rising tide and from left to right for a falling tide. Just within the circle is a disc, 1 2 inches in diameter, ruled with parallel lines, say, one-sixth of an inch apart, representing tenths of feet of amplitude, and numbered to make mean sea level any convenient reading. The disc bears a pointer extending acrosi the· sys.tern of circumferences, already described. After setting the pointer at the proper fraction of hour (the fraction of hour in the time of occurrence of mean sea level, column 5, p. 570, Part II) and across the proper circle (column 6), the disc is weighted down or otherwise held in position. A graduated scale revolving about the center of the circles is set with its.edge upon the exact hours of-this circle. The amplitude of the tide taken from this scale -is then projected by. means of the parallel lines upon the disc, upon a line perpendicular to them. This gives the required hourly heights. In computing the effects of the diurnal components upon the amplitude (No. 498, Part II) it is convenient to make use of a system of parabolas whose ordinates are the ranges of the diurnal wave and whose abscissre are twice the ranges of the semidaily wave. The diurnal components are found as described on page 571, Part II. · As a test of this process, ordinates have been inferred from high and low waters at Presidio, California; extending from January I' 1898, over series of 191! days. The results as obtained from these ordinates generally compares well with results obtained from analyzing the observed ordinates for the same period. The results, not corrected for imperfect elimination, are as follows:

145. In sections 30, 31, Part III, a plan is outlined for finding the spring and neap ranges of tide and the approximate value of S 2 from observed high and low waters. In practice it is .generally best to assume that the age of the phase inequality is known from an harmonic analysis at the given station or at one not far away (see tables

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

under section 97, Part IV A, section 19, Part IV B). If harmonic constants are to be found, it seems best to use the method described in section 7 4, Part II, and slightly improved in section 144, Part V. The assuming of the age makes it possible to use comparatively short groups at springs and neaps. In correcting for parallax it has been found best to make use of mean, rather than true, perigees and apogees. The times of the occurrence of these are giv~n in Table 58, and the effect of the parallax wave upon the spring and neap ranges is given in Table 59. 146. In sections 36-39, Part III, a treatment of high and low waters for obtaining quantities connected with the diurnal part of the tide is given. In practice we can generally assume that the age of the diurnal wave is known from harmonic analyses at the given station or at one not very far away (see tables under section 97, Part IV A, and section 19, Part IV B). If harmonic constants are to be found, it seems best to use the method described in section 74, Part II, and slightly improved in section 144, Part V. The object of giving the below computations is to show how the nonharmonic quantities can be obtained and how corrections for the time of year and for the longitude of the moon's node are to be applied. The results obtained from a one-month series apd from one six months in length are seen to be in fair accord with each other. Before beginning these computations, it is assumed that if Greenwich transits have been used, the intervals have been so corrected as to refer to the local meridian. The effect of solar K 2 upon the interval can generally be ignored in computations relating to short series.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, HJ07.

147. Where the tides are chiefly diurnal, it becomes necessary to make reduction of the equatorial tides in order to ascertain the semidaily wave. The semidaily wave being thus known, the diurnal can be ascertained at the time of the tropic tides by means of the great tropic range of tide and the times of occurrence of the tropic high and low waters. This procedure is preferable to that proposed in Part III, which makes use of Table 20, because mean sea level is subject to considerable variation. Given the displacements (accelerations) v and w of the semidaily wave due to the diurnal wave, then the HW-phase, fJ, can be found either by means of a table, like Table 17 extended, or by means of the formula: tan (HW-phase)

= -

l I V W tan v cot ·w tan (45° - -) . 2 2

+
4

(348)

This equation is found by successively substituting for b t in the derivative of ( 27), Part III, equated to zero, - t v and 90°-t w, and eliminating B : A. A reduction of the tides for one year at Manila shows that, not only can the ranges and intervals be determined from observed high and low waters, but also that the principal harmonic constants determined by this means agree well with the constants obtained by analyzing hourly ordinates. 148. Mi"scellaneous remarks and corrections. In section 24, Part I, the wave profile is shown to be trochoidal; but the approximation there used for y requires a correction when the amplitude of the wave is a considerable fraction of its length. The necessity for this correction is apparent in Fig. 1 ~, Part IV A. Using the value of x given in (51) Part I and increasing the right-hand member of (52) by a quantity gives
E=--·

e,

the value of

f8;:Jx, JB=o.

where J"=y-h, equated to zero (349)

'Am' 47t

In other words, the condition of continuity where a whole wave length is considered preventsy'=J'-h from having the form (52). In equation ( 1), Part I, for 50, substitute 48.8. The same substitution should be made in second footnote, section 93. Here also substitute for ''daily retardation,'' "retardation per solar day," and for 36, 88, 51, and 49; 35, 87, 50, and 48, respectively. In section 5, Part III, a graphic process is outlined for determining the times of maxima and minima of a wave composed of two simple waves, the period of one being twice that of the other. In construction of Tables 4 and 44 the following process of further approximation was used: Let v' denote the approximate values of v, either directly from construction or from a second or higher approximation. Then

--v=- v'+57.3y

If this value of v does not satisfy equation (28), Part III, where A=t, a second

approximation should be made i.n the same manner. If we write

z=cps /3,

(352)

then, in the limiting or discriminating case, B and f3 are connected by the relation

z2-z=!s{f! 6 ~)·

(353)

This equation, equated to zero, represents the discriminant of eq. (28), Part III, wherein xis written for cos !vt.

In section 20, Part III, for 1.oo6, put 1.012.

An harmonic analysis of the tide at Tamatave, made by the French, show that more of the cotidal lines should meet the eastern coast of Madagascar than are represented as doing so in Figs. 6, 7, Part IV B. In fact, under this station, page 350, Part ·IV B, the M 2 -cotidal hour is given as X.33, indicating that at least lines Xt-XIIt meet the .coast. The values used in the construction of the cotidal lines for this region were taken chiefly from the Admiralty Tide Tables; the French values 'for Tamatave did not come to my notice until after the chart had been constructed. Recent observations at Kiska Harbor, Aleutian Islands, show that the crowding up of the cotidal lines should occur in this vicinity instead of a little farther east, as shown in Figs. 34, 35, Part IV B. Observations give for mean high and low water intervals 2h 07m and gh r7m, and for mean range of tide 1.9 feet. This fact, together with the small range of tide found at Kiska, go to confirm the existence of the nodal line shown in Fig. 23, Part IV A. In third line from bottom of page 545, Part IV A, fore read c. A few corrections of errata are indicated in section 76, Part II; others have been indicated on errata sheets accompanying the Reports in which the parts of this manual have appeared. For want of time, several matters whose treatment was contemplated must be omitted here. For example, the determination of the moon's mass from the ratio P 1/K1 for ocean stations where the diurnal wave is large. That the assumed mass of the moon approximately agrees with the value inferred from the tides can be seen upoti comparing the ratios P 1 /K 1 for such stations in section 97, Part IV A, and section 19, Part IV B, with the assumed theoretical ratio. Other astronomical quantities catt be estimated from the tides. The slow rate of propagation in rivers, or other arms of the sea, having broad marginal strips of shallow water, or inequalities in shoreline like those possessed by Chesapeake Bay, is another matter passed over for want of time. A few other matters are: The course of the diurnal wave, the K 1-wave, for instance; the analysis and discussion of long-period gravitational tides; the latitude-variational tide; improvements in the methods of making and reducing observations; and the construction of additional auxiliary tables.

LONG WIRE DRAG.
By N. H. HECK, Assistant.
The success of the harbor and channel sweep, which was introduced in 1902, at once created an urgent demand not only for the dragging of the limited areas for which it was adapted, but also for the same class of work over areas too great to be covered economically by it. Happily, the use by the French hydrographic service of a seinelike device in dragging one of their harbors suggested the use of a single wire supported by buoys at short intervals. It was believed that such a form of drag could be operated in navigable channels without interfering with the passage of vessels, and that its depth below the surface could be regulated with a reasonable degree of certainty. A wire drag 1 ooo feet long, constructed in July, 1904, in accordance with this idea, is described in the Report of the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1905.* Since that article was written, experience in .the use of the drag under highly dissimilar conditions has suggested improvements in the details of construction, in the methods of operation, and in the preparation of the final results. The drag has been tested by use in the deep water on the coast of Maine, and in the shoal water about Key West, Fla., and in all kinds of weather, and under the most varied conditions has proved its effectiveness in detecting all obstructions within the deptb at which it is set. Pinnacle rocks which ordinarily escape the sounding lead are always revealed by it. It is equally effective in discovering uncharted bowlders, ledges, coral reefs, and heads. The statement that a region has been explored with a device which gives absolute assurance that no such obstruction can have escaped the surveyor gives a value to the chart that nothing in the past has afforded, and relieves the navigator of the mental strain that only those who have been charged with the safety of lives and property under the ordinary conditions can appreciate. The rapidity with which large areas can be searched is one of the drag's great values. It can be operated at from l to 2 miles per hour, and, under the most unfavorable conditions that will permit of work, half a square mile can be covered in a day, while three times that area can be swept unQer favorable conditions. The drag can be used when hydrographic work with a single launch would be too hazardous to be permissible. The drags that have proved most satisfactory are of the following lengths: -·-- ---------·---- - ------- - - - - - - - - - - - Length of

In this is included the expense of superintendence, pay and maintenance of officers and men, transportation to and from the field, cost of material, hire and maintenance of launches, and all incidental expenses. The drags A and D are used in open w~ters where existing surveys indicate no shoals with less than the depth sought. B is used to cover narrow areas outside of those covered with A, and near or among shoals .. C 1s used for the same purpose as B, and is especially useful in narrow channels. In order to avoid confusion the following definitions of terms used in this paper are given: Length of upright: The distance from the center ·Of the buoy to the bottom of the weight. Drag depth: The distance between the surface of the water and the bottom wire of the drag while in use. . Effective depth: The distance between the plane of mean low water and the bottom wire of the drag while in use. Depth to be verified: The depth, below the plane of reference, above which obstructions are sought.
CONSTRUCTION.

The drag consists of a horizontal member composed of a number of sections of No. IO American gauge galvanized wire, supported at intervals by vertical wires and. buoys and provided with suitable weights. At the ends, and in the center when three launches are used, the buoys are of sufficient size to prevent their submersion when the device is being towed. The intermediate buoys are smaller and just sufficient to support the weight and leave their upper cones above water. Tow lines are attached at the lower points of the large buoys, and the weights and lengths of the vertical members are so proportioned as to keep the sweeping wire at the same distance below the surface throughout its length during the operation of sweeping.
DIMENSIONS.

The length of the uprights of the drag depends on the locality, the range of the tide, the depth of the water, and the depth to be verified. For example, on the coast of Maine the conditions are: Generally deep water; mean range of tide, IO feet; the depth to be verified, 36 feet at mean low water. The results of a preliminary computation were tested by experiments and the lengths in feet of uprights adopted for the conditions on the coast of Maine, given

above, were 60-56, 56-52, and 52-48, the first number in each case referring to the large uprights, and the second number to the small uprights, the proper length to .be m:ed depending upon the state of the tide. In the vicinity of Key West, Fla., where the depth of the water exceeds but slightly the depth to be verified and the range of tide is 2 feet, in verifying depths of 35 and 30 feet at mean low water 42-42, and 37....:37 were used.
MATERIALS.

Buoys.-The large buoys, one at each· end of the drag, and one at the middle when three launches are used, are double cones, each cone 24 inches high and 24 inches in diameter at its base, strengthened by a 1-inch flange at the junction of the two cones and a stay rod running through lengthwise and projecting 2 inches at each end. These stay rods are provided with a head at one end and a thread and nut at the other, which aid in clamping the' two cones together. A galvanized-iron cap covers each end of the stay rod and is soldered to the cone. Two thimbles are strapped to the buoy in the manner shown in illustrations 3 and 5. The advantages of this arrangement are that the manila strapping gives great flexibility in a seaway, and the buoy is not liable to leak. In illustrations 2 and 3 the method of attaching the towline is shown. The end section of the towiine, 6 feet in length, is perm~nently attached by means of a wire rope thimble to the lower thimble of the buoy. When not in use the free end is fastened to the top of the buoy. The hoisting line (see illustration 5), which is used for changing the length of the. uprights, is permanently attached to the lower thimble of the rope section of the upright. The free end is attached by a snap hook to a small ring on the upper part of the buoy, and it can be carried directly to a ring on the drum of the reel when it is desired to change the length of the ~pright. The anchor line (see illustration 5), when in use, is attached ot the top of the buoy by means of a thim· ble in shackles. The small buoys are similar in construction to the large ones with cones, each I 2 inches high and 12 inches in diameter. Galvanized-iron stay rods of one-fourth inch iron extend through the buoys with an eye below and projecting 6 inches at the top, where the flagstaff is attached. The stay rods are soldered to the buoys where they enter and leave them. These buoys do not leak even when pulled under. Uprights.-The large upright is in two parts. · The upper section is 8 feet long and consists of a 2-inch manila rope, with three thimbles at regular int~rvals. In changing the length of the upright, the thimble corresponding to the desired length is shackled to the bottom thimble of the buoy. The lower section of No. 10 American gauge wire, double galvanized, 0.107 inch in diameter, is attached to the lower thimble of the rope section by a round tum and Western Union joint, a form of connection used throughout. At the lower end of the wire there is a swivel, and this is shackled to the upper staple of the weight. The large weight is a cast-iron ball with staples, as shown in illustration 3. Under the conditions met with on the Maine coast, balls 9t inches in diameter, weighing 126 pounds, proved satisfactory, while on the Key West work balls 10 inches in diameter and weighing 140 pounds were found necessary. The heavier weights cause a greater

strain on the buoys, but they make it possible to decrease the length of the uprights. The staples in each case are 4 inches high and of one-half inch round iron. The bottom wire is attached to the bottom staple of the large weight by a swivel and shackle. There is a swivel at the middle of each bottom section. At the intermediate uprights the connection is made as shown in illustration 3. A more recent form of connection which has successfully stood trial deserves a brief de~cription. A ring 2! inches in diameter is cut and passed through the eyes of two swivels and a snap hook and then welded. The bottom wires are attached directly to the swivels, the small weight is attached to the snap hook, and the upright is shackled to the ring. The intermediate or small uprights are similar to the large ones except in the fol- . lowing particulars: The rope section consists of 1-inch manila rope, and has a thimble at the upper end which is shackled to the bottom ring of. the buoy. Snap hooks are used instead of thimbles at the middle and lower end of the rope section. The connection with the wire upright is made by means of a thimble. At the bottom the wire is attached to the ring by means of a swivel and shackle. The small weight is similar to the large weight except that there is a staple only at the top. The diameter is 4! inches, the.weight is 12 pounds, and the staples, of three-eighths inch iron, are 4 inches high.

Towlines.-The construction and method of using the "towline is clearly shown in illustratio,n 4. The length from the spring balance on the boat to the point of attachment at the bottom of the buoy is 15 fathoms. The connection with the part of the towline attached to the buoy is made with a snap hook. A spring balance is secured on each quarter, and the towline is shifted from one to the other in swinging the boats. Anchors, . weighing 40 pounds, with length of line suitable to the depth of the water, are used at each end of the drag for anchoring it when not in use. The material required for a 480-foot drag, as used at Key West, Fla., with 60-foot sections, length of uprights 42-42, where the depth of the water but slightly exceeds the pepth to be verified (in this case 35 feet), is shown below:

LAUNCHES.

Covered gasoline launches, 28 to 34 feet in length, with 9 to 13 horsepower engines are used. The middle launch carries a drafting table, reel, and drag. The boat shown in illustration 7 is an ideal center launch. Each of the end launches carries a reel, but no drafting table, and may be smaller than the middle launch. Two small boats are in constant use as tenders. The gasoline engines are not so reliable as steam, but the economy of space for a given size and speed of launch makes them very convenient. It is usually necessary to construct a working platform and to place towing cleats on the launches. (See illustration 7.) The reel is made of wrought iron. Its essential parts are a drum with handles and a brake wheel on the same shaft, a supporting frame, and a roller over· which the wire passes. The party consists of two officers, a coxswain, and line tender for each launch, except the guiding launch, which, in addition, carries a foreman, who supervises the work of setting out the drag and of repairing it when necessary..
ASSEMBLING AND OPERATING.

For assembling, a wharf where there is sufficient room to stretch out the parts is used. Illustration 8 shows the men at work constructing a drag under the direction of the officers of the party. Pegs are set at the proper distances, and the finished uprights and ground wires are made to correspond. In cutting the wire and rope, ·one foot must be allowed for each joint and splice. When completed this portion of the drag is placed on the reel in the following order: End upright, first section of bottom wire, intermediate upright, and second section of bottom wire, each intermediate section being wound on the drum of the reel with the corresponding section of the ground wire, and this process is continued until the entire drag is on the reel. The free end of each upright is made fast to the bottom wire to keep .it separate from the other sections. Spare parts, properly tagged, are carried in each launch. Setting out the drag (illustration 9) is the reverse of the process just described. The buoys and weights are attached in their proper places as the wire is unreeled, one man seeing that the uprights are kept clear of the bottom wire. Chain hooks are used to handle the heavy weights, and marline spikes and pliers are used to turn the pins of the shackles.

LONG WIRE DRAG.

555

In setting out it is necessary for one of the launches or small boats to tow the drag against the tide, or in a strong tide to anchor and hold it to prevent its drifting on shoals. This operation requires about thirty minutes for a 600-foot drag. The work of running lines with the drag so as entirely to cover an area is much m·ore difficult than running lines with a sounding boat-. Cooperation between the launches is necessary. The ·plotting is done in the middle launch, which directs the movements of the others. The end launches (see illustration 10) keep at the proper distances from the middle launch, changing course when it does, but preserving the proper pull on the spring balance. At the end of the lines signals, usually made with flags, are given from the middle launch to indicate the necessary maneuver to reach the next line. Megaphones are used in case of a misunderstanding. The necessity of overlapping lines, and of keeping the drag clear of the charted shoals, and the strong relative effect of wind and tide, make the conditions rigid. However, with experienced officers and men, complicated maneuvers can be made without missing any area. At the end of a line in deep water, the drag is towed to the nexf line. In shoal water it is turned back on the same line, both of the end launches turning outward, and keeping a sufficient tension to prevent grounding. the drag. After the tum is completed the drag is kept in a diagonal direction until the next line is reached. In case of a sharp tum in a line the outer launch comes in a little toward the middle la.unch during the tum. This increases her speed and enables her to reach her new position more quickly. If the inner launch turns directly away from the middle launch at an angle of about 120° from the direction taken by the middle launch, and retains this direction until she reaches her proper distance, and then follows the new direction, no area will be missed in turning. Sextant angles to determine positions are taken in all the launches without any effort to make them simultaneous. Angles are taken every four minutes by each pair of observers when running on straight lines, but on the turns they are taken more frequently and at such intervals that the path of the drag will be known. The changes in the pull on the spring balance can be made by changing the speed of the engine. At slow speeds difficulty is found in regulating the speed of a gasoline engine, without danger of its stopping at a critical moment. This is obviated in the following manner: A wooden frame in the shape of an equilateral triangle with sides 3 feet long is towed astern of each launch. When at rest, this floats with the vertex down, a weight being attached at that point, so that the base is at the surface of the water. Lines from each end of the base extend to a crowfoot, made by splicing the lines to a thimble. From this thimble a line extends to the boat, where it passes through two small blocks, and thence back to the crowfoot and through the thimble to the vertex of the speed regulator. (See illustration 11.) By means of a lever this speed regulator can be set a~ any inclination, and the resistance varies from a maximum of about 30 pounds at the usual speed to a practically negligible amount when it is horizontal. The drag depth is regulated by the pull on the spring balance. A memorandum showing the hourly tides (prepared from the tide table, using table for hourly tides) with the proper pulls for each hour, and the times of changing pull, is furnished to the officers in charge of launches each morning. (See Table 7, p. 560.) For the final

556

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1907.

reduction of drag depths to effective depths, tide observations are made as in ordinary hydrography. The effective depth for: any given pull is measured by using a lead line graduated to feet, with the lead pointed at the top, so that it will not catch on the wire. A small boat goes ahead of the drag, and the lead line is dropped in the path of any desir'ed section, at a depth several feet greater than that anticipated. As the wire is felt, the lead line is raised until the lead passes clear of the wire, when the depth is noted. It is found that for the form of drag described above the depth varies very little throughout its length. The minimum depth so determined is adopted as the drag depth. Onehalf hour is sufficient time to test a 1 ooo-foot drag. When a shoal is struck, there arc three ways in which the fact is indicated: By the tipping over of the nearest sma11 buoys as the bottom wire comes to rest, by sudden very marked fluctuations of the pointer on the spring balance, and by a sudden increase of the pull and the stopping of the launches. As soon as the drag is aground, one launch disconnects its tow line and, accompanied by the two small row boats, proceeds to the locality indicated, and determines the least water on the shoal by sounding over the shoal area, positions being located by angles. The determination of positions is greatly facilitated by the buoys on the drag. (See illustration 12.) After the least water is found an attempt is made to remove the drag from the shoal by raising the parts which are aground by means of launches and small boats, and towing it off with one of the launches. If it is impossible to get it dear in this way, the drag is taken up, and if the wire is broken the necessary repairs are made before setting out the drag again in deep water. In making repairs a broken upright must be replaced, but a bottom wire may be spliced temporarily. Occasionally the wire breaks while the drag is in use, and in orqer to avoid doubt the area ·affected must be covered again. At the close of each day the drag is anchored by carrying out anchors from each end and dropping them with 3 to 4 fathoms of slack line. The ends are shackled to the tops of the buqys as stated above. In this positio~ the drag will ride out a gale without damage. Bad weather, when it is impossible to operate the drag, is utilized in making the necessary repairs and in constructing new sections to replace those worn out. Under ordinary conditions certain of the galvanized portions of the drag become corroded after being in use for six weeks, and then rapidly lose their strength. In the vicinity of Key West, Fla., where it was not an unusual occurrence to ground the drag on shoals four times in one day, it was necessary to replace the wire after using it for two weeks. ·

This would probably be too much if the surface of the large buoys were smooth, but the strapping and various fittings probably make it nearly correct.

Weights.-The effective area of a sphere exposed to the resistance of water may be assumed as one-half the area of the great circle. Wire and rope.-The area of the circumscribed rectangle is assumed as correct. Fittings.-The area is taken as three-fourths of the sum of the circumscribed rectangles for each part. Towline.-This, for the end launches, is taken as one-half its length X its diameter X cos. 45° (the approximate angle between the direction of the towline and the direction of the progress of the drag). For the middle launch the resistance of the towline· is negligible, as the direction of the towline is the same as the direction of the drag.

The diameter of the wire is 0.107 inch= 0.009 foot; of the rope for the large uprights, 0.052 foot; for small uprights, 0.026 foot. The principle upon which the computation of the drag depth is based is that the middle launch tows the quarter section of the drag on each side of it, or one-half the drag, and that the pull (P) of the launch divided by the resistance of this part of the drag (R) is equal to the resistance in pounds per square foot of the area exposed to resistance (r). Then R=3.73+4X i.815= 10.99 square feet andr=--- · 10.99 In Trautwine's Engineers' Pocket Book it is stated that "The resistance of water against a fiat surface moving through it at right angles is nearly as the square of the velocity, and according to Hutton its amount in pounds per square foot, approximately, equals the square of velocity in feet per second." Consequently it is assumed that V (the theoretical velocity of the drag in feet per second) is approximately equal to the square root of r.

V2 (the actual velocity of the drag for different conditions of the tidal currents) is scaled from a hydrographic sheet covering an area which has been investigated and represents the mean of a large number of measurements. The resulting values are given for comparison in the following table:

By taking the means of V 1 and V2 for corresponding cases, it is found that V2 = C V 1 , where C is constant. For fair tide C = 0.93, for slack tide o.J.8, and for head tide 0.55. The mean for fair and head tide, 0.74, shows very close agreement with that for slack tide. Illustration 13 indicates the manner in which the drag depth at the middle large upright is computed. The system is considered as in equilibrium about the bottom of the large buoy, and the moments are taken about this point, the various resistances being kept in equilibrium by the large weight. All resistances and weights, except the resistance of the rope and wire sections of the upright, are assumed to act at the bottom of the large weight. Then I 15.4X 58 sin A= [(7.26+0.24+0.10+0.54) 58+ (o.44X 32~) +(o.42X4)] r cos A and tan A = 0.073 r when A is the angle of inclination of the upright and d=D cos A, where D=length of upright, and d =computed drag depth. The following table gives the values of A, and d for given values of D, also for the sake of comparison the measured drag depths:

of the end upright is obtained as shown in illustration 14. Each end launch is assumed to tow one-quarter of the drag, and preserves the necessary tension to keep the drag in its proper position. Then u5.4X 58 sin A= (4.24X 58 + 14.5 + 1.7)r cos A sec C tan A = 0.0390 sec C r sec C= 1.976 · t,an A = o.077r This makes the computed drag depth t to 1 foot less than at the middle upright. As the measured drag depth is the same as at the middle uprights, a slight error in the assumptions is indicated. The drag depth at the intermediate uprights is obtained by taking moments about the b0ttom weight, the resistances of the upright being held in equilibrium by the vertical reaction at the small buoy equal to the weight. Then 15.8X 55 sin A= (0.5 X 55 +0.21X51+0.41X23) cos A tan A = 0.0540 r

The measured values are the same as in Table 5. The method used above is approximate, but it is sufficiently accurate for the purpose of comparison. The true form of all parts of the wire is a curve, but the change in length due to this cause is negligible.

In the table, V is the horizontal component of the length of each section in the direction of the progress of the drag, and H is the component normal to this direction. ae' = D sin A, where tan A = .077 r. In this case the r is taken from Table 4, for P = I 40. The width between the boats is then 2 (62 + 39) + 4 X 54 + 4 X 58 + 2 X 60 = 764 feet= 233 meters. Effective width of drag= 568 feet= 175 meters. The necessary overlap of lines when the boats are at their full distance (2,33 meters) is 60 meters, when the drag is properly extended. The greatest ordinate of the curve of the bottom wire from the boat is .40 meters, which indicates the position of the bottom wire of the drag with reference to the positions of the boats. By following this general method, any form of drag may be analyzed, and the drag depth obtained approximately. This is of great advantage in designing a drag to meet special conditions.

The values given above are entered in the record as the drag depths, and by applying a correction for tide to them, the effective depths are obtained. It is necessary to obtain a similar set of values, by actual measurement, for every form of drag used. The memorandum of tides and pulls which is furnished to each boat every day, must be derived from the tables similar to those given above, and from the tide tables, by allowing such a margin of safety that the effective depth will always exceed the depth to be verified.

End of day's w"ork. Anchored drag and proceeded to wharf, distant 6 miles.

A smooth hydrographic sheet is furnished to the field parties, with the limiting curves and such soundings as will be useful in keeping the drag from grounding on charted shoals plotted on it. In Maine, where the shores and edges of shoals are generally bold, and the depth to be verified is 36 feet, the 8-fathom curve is shown. In the vicinity of Key West, where the general depth is 37-42 feet, and the depth to be verified is 35 feet, the 35-foot curve is shown. Lines showing the positions of the middle launch are drawn on the boat sheet, and those for the end launches are drawn on the smooth sheet. A color is assigned to each boat, and the lines of each boat are always plotted in its proper color. After the work has been plotted on the smooth sheet, the question of the overlapping of the lines is carefully considered, and in case of doubt the area affected is transferred to the boat sheet and covered later.

LIST OF PUBLICATIONS OF THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY (EXCEPT MAPS AND CHARTS), JANUARY, 1<)03, TO DECEMBER, 1907, INCLUSIVE. This list supplements the "List and Catalogue of the Publications of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1816-1902." The list and catalogue and all of the publications listed here, except Coast Pilots and Tide Tables which are sold at the cost of paper and printing, may be obtained free of charge upon application to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D. C. The publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey consist of Annual Reports, Appendices to Annual Reports, Charts (the charts are liste_d biennially in the Catalogue of Charts, Coast Pilots, and Tide Tables, and therefore will not be listed here), Coast Pilots, Sailing Directions for the Philippine Islands, Notices to Mariners (until January l, 1908, see below under Notices to Mariners), Tide Tables, Bulletins, separately issued Publications and Chart Catalogues.
·ANNUAL REPORTS.

These consist of a review of the progress of the work during the year in the field and in the office. Professional papers relating to methods and results are published with the reports, and also published separately.
Report of the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, showing the progress of the work for the years 1902 (799 p.), 1903 (w32 p.), 1904 (774 p.), 1905 (347 p.), 1906 (230 p.), and 1907 (565 p.). APPENDICES TO ANNUAL REPORTS.
