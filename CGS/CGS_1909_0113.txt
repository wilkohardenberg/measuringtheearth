REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.
WORK OF THE YEAR.
FIELD WORK.

The usual progress has been made in the collection and preparation for publication, in the form of Charts, Coast Pilots, Tide Tables, and Notices to Mariners, of all information useful to navigators and relating to the coasts of the United States and to the coasts under the jurisdiction of the United States. The coasts of the United States have been surveyed for all the practical purposes of chart making at the dates on which the work was completed, and the work now consists in perfecting this fundamental basis by such supplemental surveys as are necessary to define all natural changes and to indicate those due to the artificial improvement of the numerous harbors, and also to meet the demands of commerce due to the increased draft of vessels. It is impracticable to make the first survey of any important portion of the coast_ in such a way that it would meet any and all demands that might be made by the future development of commerce, on account of the usual pressure for quick results and also on account of the prohibitive cost of such work. As a result, only a working basis is attempted at first, and future demands must be met by supplemental surveys. Good progress has been made in charting the unsurveyed coasts of the Philippine Islands, and about 10 per cent of the estimated extent of the coasts was covered during the year, in cooperation with the insular government, which brings the total extent of the coast surveyed in this way to 3 per 3 cent of the whole. Spanish and other surveys arc available over an additional 10 per cent of the coast, and this gives a grand total of approximately half the coast for which charts can be published to meet the present demands of commerce. Slower progress has been made in surveying the vast extent of coast line included within the Territory of Alaska, owing to climatic conditions under which the work must be done which prevent work during a great portion of each year, and to the comparatively small available force of vessels and men engaged on this survey. The first survey in Porto Rican waters has been completed except for a small amount of offshore hydrographic work. The extension of the coasts assign~d by law to the bureau for charting purposes has been so rapid in recent yea.rs that 1t has been taxed to the limit of physical and financial endurance in order to meet the urgent demands made upon it, and it is gratifying to state that no reasonable complaint in regard to the progress of the work has been made.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909.

The long wire drag, now in use by the Survey, has been considerably modified and improved during the year. The use of this or some similar apparatus is believed to be the only certain way of definitely determining whether any body of water is free from dangers to navigation or of discovering all existing dangers. One form of the drag has been described in an appendix to a previous report, and a report upon the improvements recently made is in preparation for publication. Details in regard to all .the work assigned to the Survey and to the Superintendent as Commissioner representing the United States in recovering and marking the international boundary between the United States and Canada, and in the demarkation of the Alaska boundary, are· given in the following paragraphs and in other portions of this publication. The inspection and numbering of the monuments erected along the United States and Canada boundary west of the Rocky Mountains was continued and completed up to Point Roberts. A party began to establish reference monuments on the United States shore along the water boundary west of Point Roberts. Progress was made in the work of surveying and marking the same boundary east of the Rocky Mountains in the following localities, viz, on the eastern slope of the mountains, along the Pigeon River at the west end of Lake Superior, along the eastern boundary of Maine, and along the St. Croix River. Each portion of the work mentioned above was in progress on June 30 by parties of United States surveyors. In the demarkation of the Alaska boundary in southeast Alaska monuments were established marking the crossing of the Alsek River, and a vista was opened along the line for a short distance on both sides of the river. Progress was made in opening and marking the line in the vicinity of the Unuk and Leduc rivers. On the one hundred and forty-first meridian the line was located to a point 195 miles south of the Yukon River, the triangulation was completed to a point 138 miles south, and the topographic survey to a point 90 miles south. In this connection attention is again called to the importance of providing for a triangulation down the Yukon River from the boundary to the mouth, as recommended in my preceding report, to form a connected line of geographic positions down the valley of one of the great rivers of the world as a basis for all future surveys and to correlate detached portions of work already authorized in this region in the economic investigation of the country. Work at the latitude observatories at Gaithersburg, Md., and at Ukiah, Cal., maintained by the International Geodetic Association under my direction, was continued during the year. One officer continued on duty as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, and another was continuously employed in cooperation with the Maryland State Board of Shell-Fish Commissioners in making a survey of the natural oyster bars and rocks in the State of Maryland. The work in Wicomico and Worcester. counties was completed and reports covering the work were prepared and published. The triangulation of the city of New York by the corporation under the direction of ati officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was. completed and the results have been published by the corporation. As a result of this cooperation between the city authorities and this bureau the much-needed coordination of the geographic positions previously determined from independent bases within the limits of Greater New York

was accomplished at a very small cost to the Government, as the entire expense except the salary of the officer who directed the work was paid by the corporation. Supplementary work to accomplish the result referred to above would eventually have been done and the request for cooperation was gladly complied with as an economic proposition from our point of view, and the chief engineer of the city in the publication containing the results of the work makes the gratifying statement that "the arrangement under which this work has been carried out has proven most satisfactory and economical to the city of New York." Geographic positions were established and marked at numerous points within the city limits which will be preserved under the protection of the corporation and will serve as a basis of any work which may be needed in this locality for all time to come. In response to a request from the governors of the States of Louisiana and Mississippi, and under the authority of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, an officer located and marked the water boundary between these States as established in a decree of the United States Supreme Court. This boundary is the deep-water sailing line emerging from the most eastern mouth of Pearl River into Lake Borgne and extending through the northeast comer of Lake Borgne north of Half Moon or Grand Island; thence east and south through Mississippi Sound, through South Pass between Cat Island and Isle au Pitre to the Gulf of Mexico, as marked on certain charts used by the court. Astronomic observations to determine latitude, longitude, or azimuth were made in Alaska, British Columbia, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Observations to determine the relative force of gravity were made with a halfsecond pendulum at nine stations distributed as follows: One in the District of Columbia three iri Florida, one in Louisiana, one in Texas, one in Oklahoma, one in Tennessee, and one in South Carolina. Attention is called to the use of an interferometer, suitably modified, in the determination of the flexure of the pendulum support as described in general terms in connection with the detailed statement of field work in Appendix 2 under the head of "Gravity observations." The Standard levels were extended in Arizona, California, l\fontana, Nebraska, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. Topographic surveys were made in California, Louisiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Virginia, and Washington. Triangulation was done in California, Florida, Louisiana, Maine, Maryl~nd, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, and \Vashington. In Texas the primary triangulation was extended 325 miles west from the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian. Additional connections were made between the primary triangulation along the Coast Range of mountains in Oregon with the tertiary triangulation along the coast, and the geographic positions of all aids to navigation were determined. The recovery of old triangulation stations, with supplementary triangulation including the determination of the geographic positions of aids to navigation, was continued along the coast of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, and the west coast of Florida. This work was completed along the east coast of Florida and the

Florida Keys to Key West. The extension of the Florida East Coast Railway is in operation to Knights Key, 45 miles east of Key West, and is being rapidly completed to Key West. A great many of the tidal channels between the keys have been closed entirely and at others only a narrow channel has been left. In a few places wide spaces have been left open, but even in these spaces the piers for the arches of the Long Key Viaduct and the bridge piers elsewhere have broken the wide tidal openings into 60-foot spaces and the tidal flow is much affected. This wholesale interference with natural ·conditions must cause material modifications of the existing banks and eventually of the shape and extent of the keys, with more or less radical changes in the tides and tidal currents. The investigation of the navigable waters on the coast of Maine and in the vicinity of Key West, Fla., with the long wire drag was continued. After a thorough examination of any body of water with this drag it can be positively asserted that no undiscovered danger to navigation exists with less water on it than the depth verified. Hydrographic work was done in California, Connecticut, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, and Virginia. An exhaustive examination was made over an extensive area (approximately 300 square miles) in searching for a large bank reported by the steamship Mongolia as existing about 17 miles southwest of the Farallon Light off the entrance to San Francisco Bay, California, and it was shown that no such bank exists. A search was also made for a shoal spot reported by the steamer Alameda as located about 8 miles southeast of the Farallon light, and no indications of such a spot were found in the vicinity. In this work a "submarine sentry" set to a depth of 30 fathoms was used by the vessel to make the examination more thorough than would have been possible by sounding. An examination was made in the vicinity of the main ship channel across the bar off the entrance to San Francisco Bay, and it was shown that no material change has occurred since the previous survey was made in r 900. The supplemental work on Georges Bank and Shoal in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Massachusetts was completed and offshore hydrographic work was done west of the island of Porto Rico. The collection of information for a revised edition of the two Coast Pilot volumes covering the coast from Point Judith, R. I., to Chesapeake Bay Entrance was completed and a new edition of the volume relating to the coast between Point Judith, R. I., and New York City was prepared and published. A revised edition of the Coast Pilot volume covering the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington was prepared and published. The magnetic survey of the country was continued by making observations at 279 stations distributed over 35 States and Territories and numerous observations were made at sea on board the surveying vessels on their cruises to and from their fields of work in various portions of the country. A continuous record of the relative value of the magnetic elements was obtained at the magnetic observatories maintained by the Survey at Cheltenham, Md.; Baldwin, Kans.; Sitka, Alaska; Honolulu, Hawaii; and Vieques, P. R. Continuous records with seismographs were obtained at the magnetic observatories, except at Baldwin, Kans., where there is no seismograph, and meteorological observations were made in connection with the regular work.

Self-registering tide gauges were maintained at the following stations: Fort Hamilton, N. Y.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Baltimore, Md.; Colonial Beach, Va., Wilmington, N. C.; Fernandina, Fla.; Galveston, Tex.; San Diego, Cal.; Presidio of San Francisco, Cal., and Seattle, Wash. The tide .indicator at Fort Hamilton, N. Y.; Reedy Island, Delaware River, Delaware, and Alcatraz Island, San Francisco Bay, Cal., have been continued, and the electric tide indicator in the rooms of the Maritime Association at New York continued to give satisfaction.
ALASKA.

The triangulation across Dixon Entrance was completed and progress was made in the survey of Cordova Bay. Dixon Entrance is important, as it includes one end of the international boundary between Alaska and Canada, and because the terminus of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, a transcontinental line, has been located on its shores. The survey of Controller Bay, begun several years ago and suspended almost immediately in order to use the vessel on work requested without delay by the Navy Department, was resumed, and was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. This bay is in the vicinity of the extensive coal fields discovered in Alaska in recent years, and it is hoped that an important commercial harbor will be developed, as an extensive area of deep water has been reported. Hydrographic work along the coast to the westward is also in progress to determine whether several dangers to navigation exist as reported close to the steamer routes in this region. In Prince William Sound and vicinity the survey of Orea Bay was completed, and progress was made in the survey of the outer coast of Hinchinbrook Island and of the shores of Knights Island. In Cook Inlet and vicinity the triangulation was completed from the south end of Kodiak Island northward through Shelikof Strait and Cook Inlet to the vicinity of North Forelands. The surveys of Port Graham and Kupreanof Strait were completed. A survey was made of the greater portion of Uganik and Uyak bays in Kodiak Island and work was done in Marmot Bay, Afogniak Island, and in Nushagak Bay. At the close of the year five surveying steamers were in the field in the localities named and the work was in active progress. The short seasons due to climatic conditions have always retarded the work, but the country is being developed at many points, and with increased facilities for obtaining supplies greater progress will be made. A revised edition of the Coast Pilot volume covering the coast from Dixon Entrance to Yakutat Bay and sailing directions from Yakutat Bay to Cook Inlet were prepared and published. The work on the Alaska-Canada boundary .was continued and details are given in another portion of this repo.rt.
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

The important work of chartering the unsurveyed waters of this archipelago was continued in cooperation with the insular government and good progress was made. The results of the fieldwork were promptly made available at the suboffice at Manila in the form of drawings for charts, which were forwarded to. Washington for review and publication. .· . The statistics for the year show that the tnangulatlon covered 13 005 square miles and the hydrographic work 6 202 square miles. A topographic survey was made along 748 miles of general coast line.

12

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909.

The Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Pathfinder, and the insular government steamers Fathomer, Romblon, Marinduque, and Research were engaged in the work and also parties living on shore. The expenses of the work were divided between the General Government and the insular government in accordance with the agreement under which the previous work has been done. Surveys were made of the following areas: On the cast coast of Luzon between Polillo and Jomalig islands and the adjacent coast of the mainland eastward to the junction with former work, with hydrographic work between Jomalig Island and the mainland, thus completing the survey along the cast coast of Luzon from San Bernardino Strait to the north end of J omalig Island; around the south end of Marinduque, and extending from Luzon on the east to l\lindoro on the west, completing the survey of the coast southward from Manila Bay to the south end of Tayabas Province, Luzon; along the east coast of Panay and across to Leyte, joining the work north of Negros and Cebu, completing the surveys in this vicinity; around the west, south, and east coast of Bohol, and extending to Cebu and Leyte, completing the survey of the west coast of Leyte; and Dumanquilas Bay and approaches. Tide observations were made in connection with the hydrographic work, and a continuous record of tidal changes was obtained with self-registering gauges at Manila and Iloilo. The organization of the work in the Philippine Islands remains unchanged. All the work necessary for chart construction is performed in the suboffice, and drawings for new charts and new editions of charts are prepared and sent to Washington for completion and publication. New editions of the sailing directions for the islands are prepared and published as often as necessary, and a monthly Notice to Mariners was published.
OFFICE WORK.

Good progress was made in the various branches of the work in the Office, including computation, plotting, and discussion of the results of the work in lhe field, and in the preparation of data for publication of new charts and new (corrected) editions of charts previously published. As usual a great deal of information compiled from the records in the Office has been furnished in response to requests from official and other sources and the demand for charts was larger than during any previous year. A new adjustment of the precise leveling results in the United States was made to include all work completed to the end of 1907, and the results were prepared for publication. The preparation of a publication entitled "The Figure of the Earth and Isostasy from Measurements made in the United States" was completed. This publication includes all results available in 1905. The computation of the results available to the end of 1908 for a similar discussion and publication were nearly completed. Five volumes containing the results of magnetic observations at the five magnetic observatories maintained by the Survey, made previous lo January 1, 1905, were completed for P'!blication. The preparation of the results of Cheltenham, Md.; for 1905 and i906, and at Sitka, Alaska, for 1905 was also completed. Tide tables containing the predicted tides for numerous ports on the coasts of the United States and in foreign countries for the year 1910 were prepared for publication. New editions, revised to date, of the Coast Pilot volumes covering the coasts from Point

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

Judith, R. I., to New York, the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington, ana the coast of Alaska from Dixon Entrance to Yakutat Bay were prepared for publication. A list of these and the other publications during the year is given on page 20. The annual report of the Survey for 1908 was prepared for transmission to Congress. The amount appropriated for the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1909, was $996 290, of which $245 ooo was for manning and equipping the vessels of the Survey, $40 ooo for repairs and maintenance of vessels, and $so ooo for Office expenses. The remainder of the appropriation was divided between the expenses of the parties in the field $325 400, and salaries of field and Office forces $335 890. In addition to the above sums the appropriation for marking the United States and Canada boundary (except a portion of the water boundary) and for locating and marking the Alaska boundary, made to be expended by the Secretary of State, are disbursed under my direction as Commissioner by the Disbursing Agent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, as special disbursing officer of the Department of !?tate.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909. VESSELS AND THEIR WORK.
STEAMER BACHE.

This vessel was at Baltimore having repairs made July 1 to August 21. Preparations for field work were then made and the vessel sailed for the New England coast on August 31. On September 6 the resurvey of Georges Bank in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Massachusetts -began where the work was suspended in the previous year, and it was completed on October 22. The work was facilitated by using a whistling buoy, which was placed on the bank by the Light-House Board. at the request of the Survey. Soundings were then made to show the present condition of certain features of the Middle Ground in Vineyard Sound, Mass., the Middle Ground Shoal in Fishers Island Sound, and the rocky ground east of Cormoran.t Island. After completing the work assigned to the party, the vessel returned to Baltimore for repairs on November 20, and remained there until January 17. The Bache sailed the next day for Porto Rico, and from January 29 to June 12 was· engaged in extending the hydrographic work off the west coast of the island of Porto Rico, and in doing topographic work on Mona and Desecheo islands. An examination was also made of Yabucoa Harbor, east end of Porto Rico Island. The vessel returned to Baltimore on June 2 1, and minor repairs were in progress at the end of the year.
STEAMER ENDEAVOR.

This vessel was put in commission on November 11, and preparations were made for field work on the coast of North Carolina. Repairs were made to the ship at Norfolk, and she sailed on December 15 for Pamlico Sound. The recovery of stations and supplementary triangulation were completed between Hatteras Inlet and Croatan Light about June I. During June supplementary topographic work was done on the west side of Croatan Sound and a topographic and hydrographic survey was made of Oregon, New Loggerhead, and Hatteras inlets. Work was in progress in Albemarle Sound on June 30.

TAKU.

The topographic and hydrographic survey along the southeast coast of Hinchinbrook Island, Alaska, was in progress on July I and was completed to junction with previous work near Cape Hinchinbrook on the 31st. The party then proceeded to Knights Island, Prince William Sound, and continued the survey in the vicinity until September 24, when the work was suspended for the winter. The reefs reported by the United States revenue cutter Nlanning, off Knights Island, and by the s.teamship Pennsylvania, north of Seal Island, were examined. The Taku was then taken to Orea and laid up for the winter and the party reached Seattle on October 2 1. · On April 20 the Taku was placed in commission and repairs were made. The survey of the head of Orea Inlet, Prince William Sound, Alaska, as requested by the Department of the Interior and by the War Department, was begun on May 12, and was completed on June 26. . On June 30 the Taku was at Orea preparing for work in the vicinity of Knights Island.

OFFICE OF INSPECTOR OF GEODETIC WORK.

J. F.

HAYFORD,

Inspector.

The duties of the Inspector were performed at the Office in Washington, where the records of the field parties were examined as they were received and an effective supervision of the work was maintained in this way. The most important events of the year in connection with the geodetic work were the completion of the astronomic observations necessary for the 1909 determination of the figure and size of the earth from measurements made in the United States, the completion of two long lines of precise leveling, and the beginning of the triangulation from the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation in Texas to the western oblique arc in California. A series of astronomic observations to determine latitude, longitude, and azimuth, for use in connection with a new determination of the figure and size of the earth from measurements in the United States, was begun in August, 1905, and was completed in November, 1908. This series, together with certain old astronomic observations which became available during this interval, added about 50 per cent to the astronomic observations used in connection with the 1906 determination of the figure and size of the earth from measurements in the United States. The connection of mean sea level at San Diego, Cal., by precise leveling with an elevation previously determined by the Survey at Ogden, Utah, was completed, and also the connection of elevations previously determined in Pocatella, Idaho, and in Crawford, Nebr. These two lines furnish two large circuits in the precise level net of the United States and a second connection with sea level in the Pacific Ocean. In the Texas-California triangulatiory. mentioned above observations were made at 51 primary stations, azimuths being determined at 7 of these, and the measurement of a primary base line 12 kilometers long in 5.1 months. The progress of the work along the axis of the triangulation was approximately 520 kilometers (325 miles). OFFICE OF INSPECTOR OF MAGNETIC WORK.
R. L.
FARIS,

Inspectoi·.

The instructions for magnetic work and the information 'required by the parties in the field were prepared by the Inspector. He made two trips of inspection during the year, one to Sitka, Alaska, to relieve the observer in charge of the observatory and start the work under his successor, and the other to Arizona, to decide on a proper site for the location of a magnetic observatory to take the place of the one at Baldwin, Kans., which will be discontinued. Several places were examined, and a suitable place was selected near Tucson, Ariz. In connection with this work magnetic observations were made at six stations in Arizona. The activity of the Survey in magnetic work may be summarized as follows:
OBSERVATORY WORK.

The magnetic observatories at Cheltenham, Md.; Baldwin, Kans.; Honolulu, Hawaii; Sitka, Alaska, and Vieques, P. R., were kept in continuous operation, and
13436-10--2

observations were obtained with a self-registering magnetograph and a seismograph at each observatory except at Baldwin, Kans., where there was no seismograph. Magnetic storms of unusual severity were recorded at Cheltenham in September and in May, and the seismograph records show the effect of 33 earthquakes. A record was obtained of 145 earthquakes at Honolulu and of 24 at Vieques. Meteorological observations were made at all the observatories.
MAGNETIC WORK OX L,AXD.

The values of the magnetic clements, declination, dip, and intensity, were determined at 279 stations, distributed over 35 States and Territories, including Porto Rico and the Philippine Islands, as shown in the following table:

The Bache on her cruise· to Porto Rico kept well inside the usual track on the outward voyage and well outside the usual track in returning in order to obtain observations in new localities in the Atlantic Ocean. The Survey vessels on the Pacific coast obtained observations on their voyages to and from Alaska and in the inland waters whenever the weather and other conditions permitted. OFFICE OF THE DISBURSING AGENT.
ScoTT NESBIT, Disbursing Agent.

The Disbursing Office of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has charge of all of the appropriations made for that service and, in addition, the appropriations made to the State Department for the survey and marking of the United States and Canada boundary and of the bounc;Iary between Alaska and Canada. The extremely wide field of work covered by these appropriations compels payments to be made in all parts of the United States, including Alaska, Porto Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippine Islands. The services of more than 70 bonded chiefs of party are required·to make these payments at the remote points occupied by the working parties of this Survey, both on land and sea· All of the public funds used by these officers are advanced from the central Disbursing Office of the Coast Survey, and the resulting bookkeeping and auditing are done in that office. Necessarily a very extensive line of correspondence results as, in addition to all pay and salaries, the manning, equipping, outfitting, and repairing of the vessels of the Survey, the purchase and sale of clothing and small stores, the system of allotments made by seamen and other employees, and the entire expense of the field work of the Service, which is both extensive and varied, and the survey and marking of the two boundary lines mentioned, are financed entirely from the central Disbursing Office. The above-mentioned chiefs of party are bonded in the sums of from $2 ooo to $10 ooo each, and, while acting as chiefs of party, these officers receive from time to time such advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent as are approved by the Superintendent and are required to meet the necessary current expenses of the work in hand. A ledger account is kept in the office of the Disbursing Ag~nt with each chief of party receiving an advance of public funds, each one being charged with .all advances made

to him and, on the other hand, receiving credit for all proper expenditures made by him, when presented on regularly supported vouchers, after such accounts have been audited in the office of the Disbursing Agent, found to be correct and approved by the Superintendent of the Survey. All of these accounts, after they have received the administrative examination required by law. in the office of the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, are, with their supporting vouchers, sent through the Department of Commerce and Labor to the Auditor for the State and Other Departments for examination and audit by him. This system has met the needs of this Survey and results, in the main, in economy and good order in its expenditures. A very large proportion of the appropriations named is now being expended in the survey of the most remote waters of Alaska and the Philippine Islands, and in the survey and marking of the boundary between Alaska and Canada, far in the interior of that territory. OFFICE OF EDITOR OF PUBLICATIONS. The Annual Report of the Superintendent (pp. l-165), covering the progress of the work of the Survey during the fiscal year 1908, was completed and sent to the Public Printer through the Secretary of Commerce and Labor on September 11, 1908, and the last proof was read and returned to the printer on December 26. Copies of the report were received for .distribution on February 3, 1909. The publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey during the fiscal year are given in the following list :

[H. L. BECK, Commanding the Schooner Transit.] SUMMARY OF RESUJ.,TS.-Hydrography: 66 square miles of area covered, 433 miles of lines sounded, Topography: 47 miles of shore line of bayous surveyed, 9 miles of shore line of lakes surveyed, 4 topographic sheets completed. Triangulation: 2 1 1 square miles of area covered, 16 stations occupied, 59 geographic positions determined.
10 045 soundings made, 5 tide stations established, 5 hydrographic sheets completed.

In January a party was organized to complete unfinished surveys on the coast of Louisiana in Atchafalaya Bay and vicinity. The work began on February 2 and continued until· June 4, when the party was disbanded. A power boat (gasoline launch) was hired and used during the season. Three old triangulation stations were recovered on Atchafalaya Bay, and one on Four League Bay, near the Gulf Coast, and connected by a new scheme of triangulation. A topographic survey was made of Four League Bay from the entrance on Atchafalaya Bay through to the Gulf of Mexico, and the hydrographic work covered the same region. Soundings were made in the dredged channels in Atchafalaya Bay, and a survey was made of Wax Lake and the passes leading into it. A plane table survey was made of Little Wax Bayou and of Big Wax Bayou from the vicinity of Belle Isle to Adams Cross. Soundings were made in the bayous. The region covered by the work is all marsh, divided by numerous channels and covered with high grass. At a number of points it was necessary to erect observing platforms in order to see over the grass.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909.

During this period the survey was completed to the vicinity of Cove Point, where it joined work previously completed by another party. The western limit of the work is the main county road, which is on the dividing ridge between Chesapeake Bay and the Patuxent River. The country is very rough agd hilly, with many small streams running through deep ravines. Twenty-foot contours were extended ov.er the area surveyed. The party proceeded to Nottingham, on the upper Patuxent River, on October 24, and began work on the extension of the topographic survey of both banks of the river from Jones Point to Hills Bridge, and up the Western Branch to Upper Marlboro. T~e work was completed on December 14.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Astronomic observations: 12 azimuths measured and 3 latitudes determined. Base measurement: 1 base line measured. Magnetic observations: 3 stations occupied. Triangulation: 5 425 square miles of area covered, 51 stations occupied, 91 geographic positions determined.

On July 1 a party was at work in Wisconsin making astronomic observations and determining the value of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism at certain stations in the vicinity of the Great Lakes. Azimuth observations were made at ~ne station in Michigan and at two in Wisconsin; latitude observ'ations at one station in Wisconsin, and magnetic observations at one station in Michigan and two in Wisconsin. This completed the work assigned to the party and it was disbanded on August 2. All of the observations for azimuth and latitude were made at stations in the triangulation of the Great Lakes by the United States Lake Survey, and the azimuth of a line of this triangulation was determined in each case. Astronomic work was resumed on October 5 in Oklahoma, and latitude and azimuth observations were made at two triangulation stations in that State. The work was completed on October 25. A signal-building party began operations in 'fexas on September 17 on the extension of the primary triangulation from the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian toward the Pacific coast. · A number of tripods and scaffolds were ready for the observing party as the result of work done during the previous fiscal year, and 10 additional structures were completed before October 29. An observing party was then organized and observations began on November 6. The necessary work was completed at 19 stations before December 31, including the determination of an azimuth at 3 of the stations. After that date, Decmeber 3 I' the work was continued in the same manner until April 20. During this period observations were made at 32 stations and 4 azimuths and 1 base line were measured. The total progress for the season is 325 miles, measured along the axis of the triangulation. The Stanton base line, 13 kilometers long, was prepared and measured in twelve days, an unusual performance in work of this character.

The work at the magnetic observatory at Cheltenham, Md., was continued without interruption during the year. A continuous record of the relative force of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism was obtained and observations to determine absolute values for the three elements were made at regular intervals. The year was notable for the number and severity of the magnetic storms, six of which may be classed as large disturbances. The seismograph afforded good results and 33 earthquakes were recorded, most of which were earthquakes of moderate intensity. A record was obtained of one of the destructive shocks in Italy. During the year observations were made to determine the value of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism at the stations named above by observers detailed to work under Mr. Burbank's direction.

[\\'. H. BURGER.) SUMMARY OF RESL'LTS.-Astronomic observations: 4 azimuths measured and 1 latitude determined. Gravity observations: 9 stations occupied. Magnetic observations: 16 stations occupied. Triangulation: So square miles of area covered, IO stations occupied, 17 geographic positions determined.

Astronomic observations were in progress in Oregon on July 1, and this work was continued until October 16, except that work was suspended for thirteen days (September 21 to October 3). During this period observations to determine an azimuth were made at r station in British Columbia, r in Kansas, and 2 in Washington. Latitude was determined at r station in Oregon. Advantage was taken of the presence of the observer in the various localities mentioned to have magnetic observations made at 6 stations, distributed as follows: 1 in British Columbia, 1 in Kansas, 2 in Oregon, and 2 in Washington. In February a party was organized to make pendulum observations to determine the force of gravity at various stations in the United States. Observations were made at the following stations: 1 in the District of Columbia, 3 in Florida, 1 in Louisiana, r in Texas, r in Oklahoma, r in Tennessee, and r in South Carolina. The field work began on February 13,

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909.

and was in progress on June 30. These observations were made with the half-second pendulum apparatus for the determination of the relative value of the force gravity, using the Coast and Geodetic Survey office at Washington as a base station. One new feature of importance has been introduced into the method of observation. Formerly the correction for flexure of the pendulum support was determined by measuring under a microscope the displacement of the support caused by a horizontal force of r 500 grams applied to the pendulum case at the elevation of the knife edge. In this work the flexure of the support was measured at each station in terms of the wave length of light by the use of an interferometer. The flexure measured is simply that due to the action of the pendulum while swinging through an amplitude of 28 to 114 minutes of arc on each side of the vertical.* Under these conditions, the maximum value of the horizontal component of the force which the swinging pendulum brings to bear upon its support is only 40 grams. It is believed that the resulting corrections to the observed periods of the pendulum to take account of the effect of flexure are of greater accuracy than those derived by the old method. The principal difficulty encountered is due to irregular tremors in that support of the interferometer, which is independent of the pendulum support. This change of practice substitutes a dynamic method of measuring a dynamic phenomenon for a static method, and it substitutes for a measurement under exaggerated conditions (with the applied forces 50 or more times as large as they are under ordinary conditions) a measurement with the forces exaggerated but little\ if any.

The work at the magnetic observatory at Baldwin, Kans., was continued during the year. A record of the relative force of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism was obtained with self-registering instruments and observations were made once each week to determine the absolute value of these elements. Daily meteorological observations were also made during the year.
WASHINGTON.

[H. C. DENSON, Commanding Steamer Patterson.)

During the period November 29 to January 21 current observations were made at various points in Puget Sound, and one station was occupied in each of the following localities: Elliott Bay off Seattle, off West Point light, Port Madison, in Agate Passage, Possession Sound near Muckilteo Point light, north end of Colvos Passage, off east entrance to Richs Passage, and at west end of Richs Passage. A comparatively long series of observations were made off West Point and Muckilteo Point lights, and a short series at the other stations. After the c~rrent observations were discontinued, supplementary surveys were made in Seattle and Quartermaster harbors, in the vicinity of Everett, and in Sinclair Inlet. The information necessary for a revision of the charts in these localities was obtained.
*In the regular gravity observations the pendulum is started with an amplitude of about 29 minutes of arc on each side of the vertical.

A large area (approximately 300 square miles) was covered by sounding south of the Farallon Islands, off the entrance to San Francisco Bay, in searching for banks reported in this vicinity, and no indications of such banks were found. In this work a "submarine sentry" set to a depth of 30 fathoms was used by the vessel to make the examination more thorough than would have been possible by sounding. A resurvey of a portion of San Francisco Bay, near Mission Rock, was made. Soundings were made across San Francisco bar in the main ship channel, and it was shown that no material change has occurred since the previous survey was made in 1900. A resurvey was made of the western end of Suisun Bay. A supplementary survey was made along the water front of San Francisco, Oakland, Alameda, and "Point Richmond to secure data for a revision of the charts, and a topographic survey was made of an addition to the reservation at the immigrant station on Angel Island at the request of the immigration authorities.

[0. B. FRENCH.) SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Triangulation: 335 square !lliles area covered, 31 stations occupied, 154 geographic positions determined.

On October 1 a party was organized to do the triangulation necessary for the topographic survey of Great Bay and the Piscataqua River, New Hampshire. The nearest available stations of the old triangulation were recovered and the work was extended to cover the region between Exeter, N. H., and North Berwick, Me., and between the ocean and Dover and Newmarket. The geographic positions of all the prominent objects, such as church spires, cupolas, flagstaffs, and chimneys, within the above limits were determined. The work was completed on November 6. The work of collecting data for the revision of the charts of Cape Cod Bay was then taken up and was in progress on June 30. One hundred and seventeen stations of the old triangulation in this region were searched for and 53 of them were recovered. Forty-nine of the old stations have been destroyed and 15 were not found, though if is possible that some or all of these may be recovered if it becomes necessary to incur the expense that would be involved in the recovery of the positions by ·triangulation. Observations were made at as many as necessary of these stations to determine the positions of all objects needed in the chartrevision work. The region covered extends from Scituate to "Wellfleet and along the ocean side from Chatham to Pomet life-saving station. Computations were made as the work progressed and the changes on the charts were plotted, as noted, except the topographic details from Ship Pond to Wellfleet. The chart-revision work in the vicinity of Cape Cod was suspended in December (28-31) in order to visit Nantucket Island for the purpose of revising the ocean shore line at the point known as the "Haulover." The old opening in the shore line at this point has been closed by the shifting sand and there is nothing left at present to indicate that an opening ever existed. The present position of the shore line was determined.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909.

The following is a brief statement of the work accomplished by the wire-drag party, which was operated in two sections during most of the season in Maine, each working in a different locality: Eastern Bay.-The area covered extends from the limit of the work previously examined with the drag to the head of the bay. Blite Hill Bay.-A considerable area was covered in this bay. It was found necessary to work with the tide, as no headway could be made against it. The danger resulting from the grounding of the drag, which caused the launches to swing and be held broadside to the tide, was eliminated by a safety device which enables a boat to head to the tide without delay. · Nortk end of Jericho Bay and Casco Passage.-The north end of Jericho Bay was examined and a number of shoal spots were found. Casco Passage was also examined and a shoal was found which fixes the maximum depth of water which can be carried through the passage. Fox Islands Thorofare.-The entire length was covered 'except a small portion at the eastern end. Muscle Ridge Channel.-The work in this channel was completed. It furnished a good example of wire-drag work under difficult conditions. South and east sides of West Penobscot Bay.-The work in this section was not completed. After the work in Maine was suspended for the season, on October 28, the party proceeded to New Bedford, Mass., and began the examination of Buzzards Bay with the long wire drag. A considerable area was covered before the work was suspended on November 21. Wire-drag work was resumed in the vicinity of Key West, Fla., on January 9, 1909, and it was continued until May 12, when it was suspended for the season. Twenty-one square miles of area was covered with the drag, involving 381 miles of distance traveled while dragging, and numerous current observations were made. The areas covered may be stated as follows: . Southwest Channel from the end of the work previously done to the entrance; West Channel from the limit of previous work to the 18-foot cunre; between the edge of the outer reef and a ridge three-fourths of a mile south of it; a portion of Hawk Channel south of Key West; and Key West Harli>or, including a portion of the Northwest Channel. The work in the harbor was unusually difficult on account of the strong currents and the large number of anchors, moorings, and other obstructions. The weather wa.S very unfavorable during the greater portion of the season and the work was seriously delayed. A hydrographic survey was made of channels through the banks west of Key West. The plan of work with the drag was changed, in order to secure greater economy and a better system of covering the area under examination. In order to facilitate plotting this work, several graphical instruments were tried and eventually a special. form of circular slide rule was devised by one of the aids in the party, and a new form of protractor by the chief of party, and both these devices were used with success. On two days during the see.son the work was done on the outer reef in water so clear that the bottom wire and weights were visible. The way in which the drag catches on an obstruction was plainly seen, and it was evident that no rock could be so smooth that

the drag would pass over it without its effect showing on the spring balances used in towing the drag. Soundings made on coral heads in this vicinity, with the sounding iead visible all the time, showed the extreme difficulty of determining the least depth of water on such obstructions in this way, as the tendency was for the lead to circle around the shoal as opposed to the efforts to place it on its top. In ordinary work, when nothing is seen below the surface of the water there is very little chance of the lead remaining on top of such obstructions. Wire drag work was resumed on the coast of Maine on June 28, and was in progress on June 30.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Reconnaissance: 2 250 square miles of area covered, 20 stations selected. Triangulation: I 800 square miles of area covered, 47 stations occupied, 53 geographic positions determined.

Triangulation along the coast of Oregon was in progress on July 1, and the work was continued until November 25. During this period the triangulation along the coast was extended from Umpqua River to Tillamook Bay, Oregon. Additional work was done in the vicinity of Umpqua Light-house, Suislaw River, Heceta Light-house, Yaquina Light-house, Nestucca Bay, and Tillamook Bay to determine the geographic positions of these light-houses and to establish stations along the shores of the waters mentioned. Unusual difficulty was encountered in the rough country along the coast in transporting the party and the necessary supplies, and considerable delay resulted from this cause. The work was done by two parties operating independently, one carrying forward the main scheme while the other completed the subsidiary schemes in the localities · mentioned. On May 1 the extension of the triangulation along the coast of Oregon and Washington was resumed. A reconnaissance was made as far north as Grays Harbor and triangulation was done in the vicinity of Coquille River and at the .mouth of Columbia River. The geographic positions of Coquille River, Tillamook Rock, Desdemona Sands, North Head, and Fort Stevens Wharf light-houses were determined, and the jetty off the mouth of Columbia River was located. The work was in progress on June 30.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Leveling: 457 kilometers of line completed; i27 bench marks established.

On July I the work of extending the standard levels in Utah northward from the vicinity of Sahara was in progress, and the line was continued until July 18, when a . junction was made, at Opal, Utah, with the work of a party leveling toward the south, which completed the connection between sea level in the Pacific Ocean at San Diego, Cal., and the transcontinental line of levels at Ogden, Utah. The line followed the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad, and the party lived in an "outfit box car," which was hired for the purpose, as the country traversed afforded nothing but the railroad to facilitate the work. This car was hauled forward by the railroad company as the work progressed and left on convenient side tracks. The officials of the company kindly granted authority to use velocipede cars as the means of transportation, which greatly facilitated the progress of the work, and the Survey is under obligations to the officials and especially to those of the engineering department for courtesies extended to the party. After completing the work as stated above the party was transferred to Crawford, Nebr., in order to extend the standard levels westward from that place. The work began on July 29 and was continued until November 5 1 when a junction was made with the work of a party running_ east, which completed the large circuit, Cheyenne, Wyo.-Ogden, Utah-Pocatello, Idaho-Butte, Mont.-Huntley, Mont.-Crawford, Nebr.Cheyenne, Wyo. The line followed the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad, which is operated by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad.

Bonita Point light had been determined before the earthquake of 1906, and a redetermination of its position was considered desirable, as it had been shown that many of the triangulation stations in this region had been disturbed by this earthquake. The position of the light on Mile Rock had not been previously determined. The work was based on three triangulation stations whose positions had been determined ·since the earthquake, and night signals were successfully used, this season of the year being very unfavorable for observations over long lines in the daytime.

An azimuth was measured in Massachusetts, in New Jersey, and in Pennsylvania. Selected triangulation stations were occupied and the azimuths of lines in the triangulation were determined. In January a party was organized to recover old triangulation stations and do supplementary work along St. Johns River, and in the vicinity of Apalachicola Bay, Florida. Several old stations were recovered and the supplemental work was extended along the river in the vicinity of Jacksonville, and in front of the city. Observations were made at I I stations in the triangulation of the river by the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, in connection with its improvement. The old triangulation stations between the mouth of the river and Palatka were visited, and the marks were recovered whenever possible. One hundred and thirteen stations were searched for and 23 of these were recovered and remarked if necessary. The other stations have been destroyed. The positions of a number of prominent objects in Jacksonville were determined. Tidal bench marks were recovered and additional ones were established at Pilot Town, Mayport, Fulton, Dames Point, and Chaseville. The old bench marks at St. Johns Bluff were found in good condition. The ·work on St. Johns River was completed on March 2o, and similar work at Apalachicola Bay was begun on the 22d, and a search was made for 23 old stations, but only 4 were recovered.

A continuous record of the variations in the earth's magnetic condition was obtained at the magnetic observatory near Honolulu, Hawaii, during the year with self-registering instruments. Observations were made once each week to determine the absolute value of the three magnetic elements of terrestrial magnetism and once each month to determine the scale values. The seismograph was kept in operation and a practically continuous record was obtained. Numerous earthquake shocks, including slight tremors, were recorded, the total being 145 for the year. The most notable shock recorded was the one which caused the Italian disaster on December 27, 1908.

SUMMARY OF Ra5ULTs.-Hydrography: 3 086 square miles of area covered, 1 510 miles of lines sounded, 9 286 soundings made, 3 tidi; stations established, 4 hydrographic sheets completed. Magnetic observations: 3 stations on land occupied, 7 stations at sea occupied.

On August 31 the steamer Bache left Baltimore for Georges Bank, off the coast of Massachusetts, to make a hydrographic resurvey of the bank and magnetic observations en route. The vessel reached Georges Bank on September 8 and the hydrographic work began immediately. With the aid of the light-house tender Mayflower a whistling buoy was placed on the bank, and this buoy, the watch buoy near Nantucket Light-ship, and the lightship were located by astronomic observations as often as possible during the season. Whenever it was practicable to do so the lines of soundings were connected with these points. The work was closed on October 23. An examination was then made of the Middle Ground Shoal, Vineyard Sound, Massachusetts, and completed on October 28. The vessel then proceeded to Fishers Island Sound and made a resurvey of Middle Ground Sho!l.l in that locality. Unfavorable weather delayed the work, and it was not completed until November 11. An uncharted rock in Captain Harbor, Connecticut, was located, and on November 14 the vessel started to Baltimore.

In July and August extensive repairs were made to the Tide Indicator at Reedy Island, Del., by a mechanician sent from the office for that purpose. A new float well, consisting of a strong wooden box inclosing a copper float tube was put in place, and the float of the tide gauge now rests on a column of kerosene oil 7 to 8 feet high, which is intended to prevent any interference by ice with the operation of the indicator in winter. The indicator is established at the Reedy Island Quarantine Station of the Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service and the Survey is under obligation to the surgeon in command of the station for the assistance rendered by his orders. In October the geographic position of the new light-house in Chesapeake Bay, off the mouth of Magothy River, known as Baltimore Light-house was determined by connecting it with the triangulation in the vicinity. In January work on the coast of Florida was resumed. The self-registering tide gauge at Fernandina, Fla., was inspected, and the position of the tide staff was verified by leveling from it to two bench marks in the vicinity. Additional observations were made in the vicinity of Jupiter inlet in order to strengthen. the triangulation at that place by reconciling conflicting observations. The recovery of old triangulation stations between Indian Key and Key West, and the determination of the geographic positions of aids to navigation along the Florida Reefs began on January 29, and was continued until May 3.

The survey of Uyak Bay, Kodiak Island, Alaska, began on June 5 of the previous fiscal year, and the statistics given above include the work done from that date to June 30. The survey of Uyak Bay and adjacent water was continued until September 24, when work was suspended for the winter. The triangulation in Uyak Bay was extended from the entrance to the head of the. bay, a distance of 32 miles, and observations were also made at several stations on Shelikof Strait in cooperation with the party on the steamer Patterson. A topographic survey was made of a portion of the shores of Takli Bay and of the bay to the northward. A hydrographic reconnaissance was made of the approach to Russian Anchorage in Takli Bay. Tide observations were made for a portion of the season at Kodiak Mining Camp, to the eastward of Amook Island, and connected by simultaneous readings with the gauge maintained by the party on the Patterson at Uyak Cannery, and a reference plane for soundings was deduced from the observations at the latter gauge. The Yukon was hauled out at Kodiak for the winter and on October 19 the party was disbanded.
[H. C. DitNSON, Commanding Steamer Patterson.]

The steamer Patterson sailed from Seattle for Kodiak, Alaska, on April 15, and between May 1 and 16 the steamer Yukon and the launches Alpha and Delta were prepared for use in the field. The vessel reached Controller Bay on May 20, and a party was established on land to continue the survey of the bay which was begun several years ago and soon suspended in response to an urgent request from the Navy Department for a survey in another locality. The survey of the bay was continued during the month of June, and soundings were made along the coast to the westward to determine whether dangers to navigation exist, as reported, close to the steamer route in this region.. The work was in progress on June 30.

and the latitude of one of the stations, and magnetic observations were made at several stations. The work assigned to the party in the vicinity of Dixon Entrance was completed on August 23. A detached survey was then made of a bay on the south side of Cholmondeley Sound based on a latitude and an azimuth determined by solar observations. Magnetic observations were also made in connection with the work. In September a survey was made of the head of Kasaan Bay, and in October the triangulation was extended from the entrance of Tlevak Strait, along the shores of Cordova Bay, and through Sukkwan Strait to Salterey Point. On September 19 the steamer Equator was hauled off a reef at Clump Point just in time to escape a heavy gale which passed over this region the following day. While waiting for the completion of a boathouse at Metlakahtla for storage purposes a topographic survey of the village was made, and on November 13 the wharf of the New England Fish Company, at Ketchikan, was located and a few soundings were made in the vicinity. This completed the field work for the season. The vessel proceeded to Seattle and reached there on November 25. On April 30 the Gedney sailed for Alaska. Magnetic observations to determine the error of the ship's standard compass were made at Seattle before starting, and magnetic observations to determine the declination at 13 stations between Seattle and Ketchikan were made with this compass en route. On May 19 the vessel proceeded to Cape Chacon, Dixon Entrance, and resumed work on the survey of Cordova Bay. The hydrographic and topographic work were extended from Point Nunez to the Barrier Islands. A number of lines were sounded, which showed clear water to the anchorage at the head of the bay. The area from the vicinity of Point Nunez to the boundary line south of Dewey Rocks and Eureka Pass through the Barrier Islands was developed by sounding, and Wallace Rock was located. The triangulation was extended from the shores of Long Island to Hunter Bay, and a self-registering tide gauge was established near the anchorage south of Hunter Bay. The work was in progress on June 30.

The survey of Shelikof Strait and vicinity was begun during the previous fiscal year and was in progress on July 1. The triangulation was extended from Kupreanof Strait to Barren Islands and the hydrographic survey of the strait was completed from Uganik Island to Cape Douglas. The triangle sides were unusually long, and it was necessary to use heliotropes at the distant stations. The positions and elevations of a number of mountain peaks were determined. A topographic survey was made of 40 miles of the coast line along the strait and in Alimvoak Bay, and magnetic observations were made at 3 stations in the strait. Shelikof Strait is an extensive bodyof water, approximately 100 miles long and 25 mlles wide, and no soundings had previously been made in it. The hydrographic work

covered the northern half of the strait, and the depths are unusually uniform, ranging from 50 fathoms on the westerly side to more than 100 fathoms on the opposite side. No dangers to navigation were discovered offshore. Topographic work was also done in Alimvoak Bay, around Cape Paramanof, and at Black Cape. Field woi:k closed for the season on October 15, and magneti~ observations were made at 2 stations on shore before the vessel started south. Magnetic observations were also made at Seattle, Wash., prior to sailing', and at Union Bay, British Columbia, going to and returning. from Alaska. The vessel returned to Seattle on November 1. On May 7 the Explorer sailed from Seattle for Bristol Bay, Alaska, and reached there on May 26. The survey of Nushagak Bay was in progress on June 30. At that date the triangulation had been completed from the entrance to the bay to a point at the head of the bay and some hydrographic and topographic work had been completed.

northeastward from Kupreanof Strait to the Barren Islands, and thence southwestward in Shelikof Strait to Cape Kaluk on the Kodiak shore and to Cape Kubugakli on the mainland. The topographic and hydrographic work was done by parties living on shore in camps established for the purpose. A survey was made of the greater portion of Uganik Bay and the triangulation was extended into Uyak Bay. Detached surveys were made of Uyak, Northeast, and Karluk harbors, except the hydrographic work, which was only completed in Uyak Bay.

The steamer Yukon was prepared for field work by the party on the steamer Patterson, May 1 to 15, at Kodiak, Alaska, and hydrographic work in the Chiniak Bay approach to Kodiak Harbor began next day. This work was continued until May 31, when the vessel went to Afognak and began the survey of the coast northward from Afognak Bay. On June 3 a portion of the engine gave way, causing serious injury to the low-pressure cylinder rod, and making it neeessary to visit Uyak Bay for repairs. The Survey is under obligation to the superintendent of the. Northwestern Fisheries Company, Mr. Fred Davidson, for his kindness in making a new piston rod for the vessel. The vessel returned to Kodiak on the 14th for coal and was able to facilitate the work of theSteamboat-Inspection Service by conveying the local inspectors to Uyak Bay, as the regular passenger steamer had become disabled and was not able to make the June trip. The vessel then returned to the working ground, and during the remainder of the month the time was spent in reconnaissance, signal building, and triangulation, and this work was in progress on June 30.

On July 1 the McArthur was at Port Graham completing the triangulation of the harbor with shore parties, living in camp, at work on the triangulation of Cook Inlet .. The main triangulation was extended up the inlet to the Forelands, a distance of 100 miles, before September. 8, when the topographic and hydrographic survey of Port Graham was begun. This work was completed on October 7, and the vessel returned to Seattle on the 24th. A self-registering tide gauge was maintained at Seldovia during the season. On April 28 the McArthur sailed from Seattle for Cook Inlet, via Kodiak, to get the launch Delta, and arrived at Port Graham on May 16. Magnetic observations at sea were made en route and during the season. On May 19 work on the extension of the triangulation in Cook Inlet northward from the Forelands was begun, and by June 30, 14 stations had been selected and 1 2 signals built. Observing parties were established on shore in camps, and topographic work was done whenever possible .without interference with the

triangulation. Nine miles of shore line was surveyed before June 30. A self-registering tide gauge was used at Seldovia, and tide observations were also made at a point about 2~ miles above East Foreland. Current observations were made with the vessel at anchor off Nikishka, and also at 10 other stations where the vessel anchored. The weather was unusually favorable, but the strong tidal currents delayed the work, and extensive mud flats at many points prevented communication with the shore except at high water.

On July 1 the survey of the outer coast of Hinchinbrook Island, off Prince William Sound, was in progress. · The work was done under conditions of unusual difficulty, as the coast is exposed, with a heavy surf, and with sand reefs extending 4 or 5 miles out to sea, and has only two landing places for small boats. Camps were established at these two places and the work was done by parties living on shore. It was not possible to land and build hydrographic signals, and natural objects, located by the . topographic party from the tops of the high cliffs, were used to locate the soundings. The topographic work was carried along the top of the cliffs, as it was impracticable to use boats along shore, and it was equally impracticable to get along the shore except at intervals and at low water. Early in August the- survey of the shores of Knights Island was begun, and this work was continued until September 26, when the field work was suspended for the winter. The east coast of Knights Island is mountainous and is indented by deep bays. A survey was made of Bay of Isles, Marsh, Hogan, and Little bays, including a topographic survey of the shores of the bays and the adjacent shores of the island, and a hydrographic survey of the bays and along the shores of the island where topographic work was done. Tide observations were made in the Bay of Isles and in Mummy Bay. The Taku returned to Cordova on September 26, and the vessel was laid up for the winter. A plane table survey was made of the new town site which had been recently occupied, and the party started to Seattle on October 10. Work was resumed at Orea, Alaska, on April 24, and repairs were made to the Taku. On May 12 a survey of the head of Orea Bay was begun, to comply with requests from the Secretary of Interior and from the Secretary of War. The triangulation was extended to cover the bay and 3 miles beyond, up the valley. Observations were made on mountain peaks and crests visible from the stations in order to determine their positions and elevations, and a base line was measured on the flats at the head ?f the bay. The topographic and hydrographic surveys previously completed were extended to cover the shores and remaining portion of the bay and the topographic work to a point 3 miles up the valley from the head of the bay. The work was completed on June 26, and on June 30 the vessel was at Orea preparing to resume the survey along the shores of Knight Island.

OUTLYING TERRITORY.
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

[E. F.

DICKINS,

Director.]

The survey of the coast of the Philippine Islands was continued under the immediate supervision of a Director, who represented the Superintend~nt in all matters requiring immediate action. He made plans for field operations and issued instructions for field work at the suboffice in Manila. The observations made in the field were computed, and drawings for charts of the regions surveyed were prepared for transmission to Washington for review and publication. Sailing Directions and Notices to Mariners were prepared and published. He was aided in this work by such advice and instructions issued from Washington as became necessary. The work was done under the same general plan of the division of expenses in force during the previous year. The National Government paid the salaries and subsistence of its technical corps detailed for duty in the Philippines, including several experts in the suboffice, furnished the instrumental equipment, paid the expenses of I large surveying steamer and for the supplies for 2 other surveying steamers, paid the expense of chart publication, the traveling expenses of officers to and from the Philippine Islands, and the hire of launches. The Philippine government paid the operating expenses of 2 surveying steamers, paid for the crew and repairs of 2 other surveying steamers (not including pay of officers), the party expenses of several surveying parties on shore, the salaries of the office force, and for office supplies obtained in Manila, and furnished office accommodations and printing. There was a free exchange of information and good offices between the Survey and the various military and civil bureaus having common aims, and a gratifying interest was shown in responding to requests for information.
FISLD WORK.

Steamer Pathfinder.-From July I to August 21 repairs were being made to this vessel at Canacao. The crew aided in the repair work as far as possible in order to save expense. During this period a supplementary survey was made in Manila Harbor. The vessel sailed August 22 for the east coast of Leyte, carrying the insular mail for Cebu and Tacloban. The mail was landed at Cebu on August 24, and at Tacloban next day. Field work began in the vicinity of Tacloban on the 25th and continued along the coast of the island until December 2 1, and the vessel returned to Manila on the 24th. Necessary repairs were made to the ship, and she sailed for Cebu on March 13 to make surveys along the east coast of the island and the work was in progress until June 5. Two severe typhoons were weathered during the season, the one on September 23 being the most severe. In this storm a steam launch and dinghy, used by a detached party at work on the east side of San Pedro Bay, were driven ashore and dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks which line the shore. The party was in great danger of losing their lives, but fortunately escaped without serious injury.

Steamer Fathomer.-Repairs were made to this vessel July 2 to August 16, and she sailed next day for Calapan, Mindoro, and surveys were made along the coast of Mindoro and 'Marinduque islands until March 13, when the field work closed and the vessel reached Manila on the 16th for the usual semiannual repairs which are necessary in these waters. The vessel sailed for Romblon on May 20 and began work on the 22d at the northern end of Tablas Islands and on the east coast of Mindoro. The triangulation was extended southward during June and was in progress on the 30th. Steamer Marinduque.-The party on this vessel was engaged in making surveys along the east coast of Luzon north of Balesin Islands on July 1, and the work continued until October 10, when work was suspended on account of unfavorable weather and the vessel sailed for Manila to have repairs made. This work was completed during the period October 17 and January 25, when the vessel sailed for the south coast of Mindanao Island, and work was in progress in this locality on June 30. Steamer Romblon.-The party on this vessel was at work on the east coast of Luzon between Lamon Bay and Calagua Islands on July 1, and this work continued until October i 8, when the continuou.s unfavorable weather resulting from the northeast monsoon forced a suspension of the work, and the vessel sailed for Manila. Repairs were made during the period October 22 and December 22, when the vessel sailed for the southwest coast of Leyte and work was in progress in this locality on June 30. Steamer Research.-The party on this vessel was engaged on field work on July 1 and continued at work until June 30. Buring this period surveys were made along the west and north coasts of Cebu, the east coast of Negros, in Tafion Strait, and along the . shores of Bantayan Islands. . Launch Morven.-A party using this launch was at work on the coast of Bohol Island on July 1" and the work continued along the north and west coasts of the island until April 30, when the party started to Tacloban, Leyte, to begin work in San Juanico Strait. The survey was extended from the work previously completed in this region along San Juanico Strait. The work was in progress on June 30, and the triangulation was completed to J anabatos Channel, the topographic survey to Santa Rita Pass, and the hydrographic work to Bacol Island. A speed-trial course was established in Subic Bay, Luzon, at the request of the Admiral commanding the third squadron of the Pacific Fleet. A course 1 mile long was selected, laid off, and marked by buoys in the water and by beacons on shore between August 28 and October 3. The Commandant and other officers at Olongapo aided the party in every possible way.
OFFIC!t WORK.

The suboffice at Manila is organized to do all the work involved in chart construction. The records of observations were received as the work progressed. The necessary computations were made and the results were compiled in the form of drawings for charts. Eleven drawings for new charts and 19 drawings for new editions of charts were prepared during the year and sent to Washington for publication. A supplement to Section I of the Philippine Islands Sailing Directions, third edition, and Notices to Mariners, Nos. 5 to 13 of 1908, and Nos. 1 to 4 of 1909, were prepared and published.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.--Seventy-two square miles of area covered, I4 stations occupied, 24 geographic positions determined.

In response to a request from the Admiral commanding the third squadron of the Pacific Fleet, a party was sent to Subic Bay to select and mark a speed-trial course 1 mile long. The naval authorities at Olongapo furnished a launch and all necessary assistance. The requirement of a depth of 30 fathoms of water along the course and along an additional mile at each end made it necessary to locate the course on the west side of the bay south of Grand Island. Along this shore of the bay the land has a steep slope and reaches an elevation of 3 ooo feet within 2 miles of the shore, and this made it difficult to select a course which could be marked without using beacons of excessive height. After selecting the course it was found to be very difficult to determine the correct locations for the ends by an extension of the triangulation already completed in this locality, due to unfavorable weather and the absence of roads and trails which made the· establishment and determination of the new stations very laborious. The work began on August 28 and was completed on October 3. The beacons were constructed by the bureau of yards and docks under the direction of the civil engineer attached to the bureau. Acknowledgment is made of the courtesies extended to the party by all the officers at the station. All the facilities of the yard were placed at the disposal of the party.
(C. V. HODGSON.] SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Hydrography: 668 square miles of area covered, 3 339 miles of lines sounded, I38 646 soundings made, 7 tide stations established, IO topographic sheets completed.

On July 1 a party was at work using the launch Morven on the coast of Bohol Island in the vicinity of Jetafe. A topographic and hydrographic survey was made of the offlying reef and islands, including Danajon Bank and Olango Island. The triangulation was extended across the strait between Cebu and Bohol islands and the topographic work to include the east coast of Mactan Island to a connection with the work previously completed in this locality. A hydrographic survey was made of the channel between Mactan and Olango islands. This completed the topography as far south as Punta Cruz, Bohol, and the hydrography as far° south as Calape Island, including the small rocky bay on which the town of Calape is situated.

A fe~ture of this region is Danajon Bank, which bends in the ~hape of a boomerang off t.he north and west coast of Bohol and marks the outer limit of the many reefs and shoals along this part of the coast. The greater portion of this bank is bare at low water as far south as Macaboc Island, and the water deepens abruptly on the inside to 15 fathoms, and on the outside to 50 fathoms and more. After January .1 the survey was extended around the southern shore of Bohol Island to a junction with the work previously completed by another party on this coast at Point Gorda. The report on the work contains many interesting details concerning the country and its inhabitants. The work mentioned above was completed-on April 30, and the party then proceeded to Tacloban, Leyte, to take up the survey of San Juanico Strait. Triangulation was extended from the completed work in this vicinity, northward along the strait to Jana-. batas Channel and· a reconnaissance for the triangulation was extended beyond this point into Villa Real Bay. The topographic work was extended from the vicinity of Tacloban to Santa Rita Pass, and the hydrographic work to the vicinity of Bacol island. Strong tidal currents exist in these ~aters, especially with spring tides.

On July 1 the party on the Marinduque was making a survey along the east coast of Luzon in the vicinity of Palilla Island, and this work was continued until October 10, when unfavorable weather caused a suspension of the work and the vessel returned to Manila. During the period mentioned a hydrographic survey was made between the coast of Luzon and Polillo Island, and also of the waters north of Cabalite and Balesin islands. En route to· Manila the geographic position of Ocata Island Light-House was determined and some additional soundings were made in the vicinity. Seven typhoons passed over this region during the season, and each one seriously delayed the work by destroying many signals and causing rough seas. Tide observations were made with a self-registering tide gauge at Port Lamon and with a staff gauge at Hook Bay. Repairs were made to the vessel at Manila, and she sailed on January 25 for the south coast of Mindanao to make a survey of this coast from the vidnity of Olutanga Island to a junction with work previously completed at Malabang. .The natives in this region were actively hostile, and the work was done as a result of the expressed wish of the military authorities, and the effective cooperation of the army was promised. The necessary orders were issued and the facilities of the military posts in the region were placed at the disposal of the party. The vessel reached Fort Margosatubig on January ~o, and a detachment 0£22 Philippine Scouts was taken on board, and during the season each surveying party sent on shore was armed and was accompanied by ·a sufficient number of scouts to protect it. The country to be surveyed was found to be densely

covered with hard-w9od trees from 5 to 6 feet in diameter, and many other obstacles prevented rapid progress. The triangulation was completed between the limits s~ted above and a hydrographic survey was made across the entrance to Dumanquilas Bay between Olutanga Island and Baganian Peninsula and along the shore at the head of Illana Bay. A topographic survey was made along the shore from the entrance to Dumanquilas Bay to a junction with the work previously completed at Malabang. The work was in progress on June 30.

During the period July l to May 13 the Research was continuously engaged, except for twenty-one days in March and April, when repairs were made to the vessel, in making surveys of the northern and western coasts of Cebu and the northern and eastern coasts of Negros. The survey of the region was extended to a line 20 miles north of Cebu, and it is now completed from Panay on the west to I.eyte on the east, and as far north as this line. To the southward the hydrographic survey was completed between Cebu and the Bantayan group and as far as the southern end of this group, or to the northern entrance to Tafion Strait. The main scheme of triangulation was extended 40 miles farther south, down the strait to San Carlos, Negros, and Balamban, Cebu. The topographic survey was extended 35 miles along the western coast of Cebu, completing the topography on this coast as far south as Tuburan. The coasts and waters surveyed had only been mapped previously by exploratory surveys and were represented on existing charts in a very general way. Many ranges of hills, rivers, and creeks were found, not shown on the charts, and the waters were proved to be much more favorable for navigation than had been supposed. The report of the work contains an excellent description of the region and an account of the people and the existing co~ditions. Exceptionally favorable conditions for extending the triangulation were found on both shores. A continuous range of°hills, about 500 feet high, extends along the coasts near each shore with isolated summits and many of them are almost entirely cleared or under cultivation. There are numerous towns with large stone churches and on the Negros shore there are a great number of sugar houses with tall chimneys. The statistics show that a large amount of work was done at a very small cost.

The Fathomer sailed from Manila on May 20 and began field work at the northern end of Tablas Island and on the east coast of Mindoro on the 22d. The time previous to June 30 was nearly all employed in selecting triangulation stations, building signals, and opening lines in the extension of the work to the southward. Some observations were made in June, and the work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year .

The party on this vessel was engaged on July l in surveys on the east coast of Luzon, between Lamon Bay and Calagua Islands, and the work was continued until October 18. The hydrographic survey north of Calagua Islands and in the vicinity of Tanao Islands was completed and soundings were made offshore between Jesus and Dagdap points, Luzon, and offshore soundings were made between Maculabo and Balesin islands, to a depth of 40 fathoms. A topographic survey was also made between these two points and along the shores of J omalig Island. Magnetic observations were made at Capalonga, and some supplementary work was done in San Miguel Bay. The vessel returned to Manila on October 22.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909·

The Romblon sailed from Manila on December 22 for southwest coast of Leyte and reached her working ground on the 26th. Field work began immediately and was continued during the remainder of the fiscal year. Old triangulation stations were recovered on Leyte, Bohol, and Lapinig islands, and the triangulation was extended sout~ward, completing the connection between these islands and between Mindanao and Camaguin islands. A hydrographic survey was made over the region covered by the triangulation. The inshore hydrography began on the southeast side of Danajon Banks, and was extended southward, developing anchorages at Cabulao and Cogton bays and the shoals which extend 2 miles offshore, to a junction with work previously completed near Jagna. On the coast of Leyte the inshore hydrography was extended southward around the south end of the island and a short distance up Lion Bay and also around Limasaua Island. This work included Port Liloan and Panaon Strait. The offshore hydrography extends from Punta Gorda, Bohol, southward to Camiguin Island and eastward to Leyte and the northwest point of Mindanao. The topographic work began at the northeast end of Lapinig Island, Bohol, joining work previously completed, and was extended southward to a junction with previous work near Jagna, completing this work along the coast of Bohol. On the Leyte shore . the survey was extended southward from former work near Green Point around the southern end of the island and up Lion Bay nearly to Malitbog; and it included the shores of Limasaua Island and detached surveys along Panaon Strait and Port Liloan. Current observations were made while the ship was at work between Bohol and Camiguin islands, where stops of fifteen minutes were necessary to make sounding's, the drift of the ship being noted at each stop. Three floats were released in this locality and these were recovered at places which 'verified the data obtained on board. In Panaon Strait a float was followed through eight times to determine the conditions at different phases of the tide. The work was in progress on June 30.

On August 22 the Pathfinder sailed from Manila for the east coast of Leyte, with the mail for Cebu and Tacloban on board. The mail w~s landed at these ports and field work began at Tacloban on August 25. A base line and an azimuth were measured, the base line on the shore of San Pedro Bay and ~he azimuth at the longitude station at Tacloban. Triangulation was extended from the measured base line to form a connection between detached work in this vicinity and between Leyte and Samar islands. The geographic positions of numerous mountain peaks on both islands were determined. The topographic survey was extended along the .coast of Leyte Island from Vigia Point to Taytay Point, a distance of 26 miles. Due to the season, with the prevailing

trade winds, all landings on this coast were made through the surf, which was very heavy during the greater portion of the time, making it dangerous to land. The inshore hydrography was completed along the coast covered by the topographic work as stated above. ·A record of the tides was obtained with a self-registering gauge on the west side of Salacot Point during two momths, and readings on a staff gauge were made for one lunar month at the old tide station in Tacloban, to establish a tidal connection between these two places. Two severe typhoons were weathered, and the one on September 23 was so severe that a steam launch and dinghy were blown on the rocks and destroyed in spite of their being anchored in a protected cove in San Pedro Bay. The officer in charge of the work was on the launch when she went on the rocks, and he was fortunate in escaping alive and without serious injury. The loss of this launch seriously delayed the progress of the work during the remaining portion of the season. Field work closed on December 2 1 and the vessel returned to Manila on the 24th. The Pathfinder sailed from Manila on March 13 for the east coast of Cebu. The field work on that coast began on the 15th and was continued until June 5, when the vessel sailed for Manila. The unsurveyed portion of this coast between Buntalinao Point.and Bagacay Point was completed, and an examination of Ormoc Shoal was made. The observations at the triangulation stations were made by parties living in bivouac camps on shore under very uncomfortable conditions. The examination made on Ormoc Shoal verified the former work ·done on this shoal. An exhaustive search was made over the locality reported for the Tritos Shoal under the most favorable conditions, but no trace of it was found. Acknowledgment is made of the assistance rendered and the courtesies extended to the party by Admiral A. P. Nazro, Capt. U. R. Harris, Commander Hugh Rodman, Paymaster J. J. Cheatham, and Naval Constructor Lloyd Bankson, officers at the naval station at Cavite, while repairs were being made to the Pathfinder.

The survey of Tail.on Strait was contfoued after May 15, and the statistics given above relate to the work accomplished before June 30. The triangulation was extended to a junction with similar work at the south end of the strait, completing the main scheme of triangulation between the islands of Cebu and Negros, and connecting with the astronomic station at Valle Hermosa, Negros. The topographic survey was extended along the coast of Cebu from Tuburan Point southward to the town of Aluguinsan and the offshore hydrographic survey from the completed work at the north end of the strait to the south end of Refugio Island. The inshore hydrographic work was not continued south of Tuburan Islanc;l. No ·special difficulties were encountered and the conditions on shore were favorable for the extension of the triangulation and topographic work.

PORTO RICO.

[W. C. HODGKINS, Commanding Steamer Bache.] SUMMARY OF RaSULTS.-Hydrography: 1 742 square miles of area covered, 1 6o6 miles of lines sounded, 7 483 soundings made, 2 tide stations established, 3 hydrographic sheets completed. Magnetic observations: 4 stations occupied on land, 21 stations occupied at sea. Topography: 30 miles of general coast line surveyed, 3 topographic sheets completed. Triangulation: 11 stations occupied, 8 geographic positions determined.

Hydrographic work west of the island of Porto Rico was assigned to the party on this vessel. Magnetic observations were made on board the vessel in Hampton Roads, Va., on January 22, and the vessel sailed for Porto Rico the next day. A selected route west of the direct route was followed and magnetic observations were made every day during the voyage. While at San Juan, P. R., the geographic positions of the new light-house on Morro Castle and of the wireless-telegraph station in Puerta de Tierra .were determined and magnetic observations were made in the harbor on board the ship and on shore. The vessel proceeded to Mayaguez on February 14 and work in this locality was continued until June 12. Magnetic observations were made on shore and on board the .vessel in the harbor, and later on shore on Mona Island. The principal work of the season was the offshore hydrography of Mona Passage, to the westward of the shoals which extend many miles beyond the mainland in this region. A topographic survey was made of the shore line of Desecheo, Moria, and Monito islands and a hydrographic survey of the adjacent waters. The work was delayed by haze in the atmosphere making the signals indistinct or invisible and by a rough sea during the greater portion of the season. A few deep-sea soundings were made off the north coast and off the south coast in the vicinity of Cape Rojo. The harbor at Yabucoa was examined by sounding, and soundings were also made in the entrance. The Bache sailed from St. Thomas for Baltimore on June 14, and again followed a selected course considerably east of the usual course, and magnetic observations were made each day, after the 15th, at sea and in Chesapeake Bay off the Patuxent River on June 21.

The work at the magnetic observatory at Vieques, P. R., was continued during the year, and a record of the relative. value of the three elements of terrestrial magnetism was obtained with self-registering instruments. Observations were made every week to determine the absolute value of the magnetic elements. Notable magnetic storms were recorded on January 3, January 26, and May 14. The seismograph was in continuous operation and a record was obtained of a number of earthquakes, most of which were of moderate intensity.

SPECIAL DUTY.
NEW YORK.

[A. T. MOSMAN.]

The field work of the trigonometric survey of Greater New York was completed by the city authorities under the direction of Assistant Mosman on July 31, 1908. The work began in May, 1903, and was continued whenever the appropriations made by the city permitted until it was completed. The following is quoted from the letter of the chief engineer transmitting the final report on the triangulation to the mayor:
The work which has been accomplished will be of very great benefit not only to th.at portion of the city for which a plan has not yet been prepared, but to those parts already mapped and to those departments which have occasion to make precise surveys. I feel safe in saying that no survey of this kind including a large urban area has ever been attempted, and this report will therefore be of s~cial value to all who are engaged in work of this character.

The triangulation covers an ar~ of 440 square miles. Two primary base lines were measured, observations were made at 161 stations, and 182 geographic positions were determined. A report of the work has been printed, which contains numerous details and a list of the geographic positions of the points determined with descriptions of all the triangulation stations.
I.,OUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI WATER BOUNDARY.

[EBl>RHARDT MUELLER.] SUMMARY OF Rl>SULTS.-Topography: 15 miles of shore line surveyed. Triangulation: 225 square miles of area covered, 1 7 stations occupied, 48 geographic positions determined.

In response to a request from the governors of the States of Louisiana and Mississippi, and under the authority of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, an officer was detailed for the purpose of marking the water boundary between these States as established in a decree of the United States Supreme Court. This boundary is the deep~water sailing line emerging from the most eastern mouth of the Pearl River into Lake Borgne and extending through the northeast comer of Lake Borgne north of Half Moon or Grand Island; thence east and south through Mississippi Sound, through South Pass between Cat Island and Isle au Pitre, to the Gulf of Mexico as marked on certain charts used by the court. On July 2, 1908, an act of the Louisiana legislature became a law and made it the duty of the chief engineer of the board of state engineers to run and fix the water boundary described above and to mark and buoy the same, and the· work referred to below was done as authorized in this act at the expense of the State of Louisiana.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909.

A patrol boat belonging to the Oyster Commission of Louisiana was placed at the disposal of the party and a small lighter was obtained from Capt. Harry Burgess, Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army, stationed at New Orleans, for use in the work. The work began on February 25 and was completed on June 30. The western portion of the boundary, from the mouth of Pearl River to a point about I~ miles north of the eastern end of Grand Island, is a curved line, and thence to the gulf the boundary is an irregular or broken line. Three points on the curved line were marked, and marks were also established at the turning points on the other portion of the boundary. The points were marked by intersecting ranges indicated by structures built for the purpose or by the beacons maintained by the United States Light-House Board as aids to navigation. The marks were made as permanent as the nature of the soil and the available funds permitted. Piles were driven in the soft marsh and concrete was used at the surface to bind them together and form a foundation for the range beacons. Cast-iron blocks were set in the concrete, to which the supports of the wooden beacons were bolted. After .the marks were established they were inspected by representatives of the two States.

UNITED STATES AND CANADA BOUNDARY.

The work of re-marking this boundary was in progress at several points along the line during the year, under the direction of an international commission in which Mr. 0. H. Tittmann represents the United States, and Mr. W. F. King, Great Britain, as prescribed in the treaty signed at Washington April 11, 1908. On July 1 a party, in charge of Messrs. C. H. Sinclair and N. G. Ogilvie, representing the Commissioners, was at Lake Osoyoos inspecting the monuments which had been placed in position marking the boundary west of the summit of the Rocky Mountains. The work was continued westward until October 1, when the last monument on the land boundary, the obelisk at Point Roberts, was inspected, thus completing the work. As the monuments were inspected the proper numbers were attached, and the recovery and re-marking of the line between Point Roberts, Wash., and the summit of the Rocky Mountains is now completei::l. A vista was opened along the line through the wooded sections, and the 409 miles of boundary is marked by 272 monuments, many of which a·re the original monuments recovered and restored. In June 1-.fr. Fremont Morse began establishing reference monuments along the United States shore of the water boundary between Point Roberts and the Pa~fic Ocean. On May 10 work in connection with the recovery and re-marking of the bo~ndary east of the summit of the Rocky Mountains was begun by Mr. C. H. Sinclair, and on June 30 the triangulation and topographic survey along the boundary was making good progress. Similar work was in progress by a Canadian party, accompanied by Mr. F. D. Granger as representative of the United States Commissioner, along the boundary north of Montana. In August Mr. W. B. Fairfield began the survey of the boundary from the mouth of Pigeon River, at the west end of Lake Superior, to the westward. Three old triangulation stati(!)ns of the United States Lake Survey were recovered,. and from these the work was extended to the mouth of the river and for a short distance above. On November 17 the work was suspended for the winter. On July 1 the work ·of recovering and re-marking the United States and Canada boundary between the headwaters of the St. Croix River to St. John River was in progress, under charge of Messrs. J. B. Baylor and G. C. Rainboth, representatives of the United States and British Commissioners. The work was continued until November 23, when it was suspended for the winter. A. vista was cut along the line over the whole distance wherever it was. wooded, and 212 boundary monuments were placed in position. These monuments mark the whole line except for a distance of 17 miles. A topographic survey was made along the line as usual. After returning to the office the maps and field notes relating to the line north of the State of Vermont were completed and placed on file. Stadia charts and field notes, covering 78 miles of the

6o

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909.

line mentioned above, were also completed. Work in the field was resumed on May 1, and monuments were placed in positions over the remaining portion of the line south of St. John River. At the close of the year the triangulation and topographic survey along St. John River was in progress. On September 2 Mr. J.E. McGrath, representing the United States Commissioner, began an examination of the United States and Canada boundary in the valley of the St. Croix River between Chippeneticook Lakes and Passamaquoddy Bay. Triangulation had previously been extended over this portion of the line and topographic and hydrographic surveys had been made along the river as far as Ryans Ripps (above Woodland). A search was made for the old triangulation stations and 30 out of a total of 44 were recovered. These will furnish an excellent base for any additional work that is required. The observer traveled between Vanceboro and Baring in a canoe in order to examine that portion of the river, and notes were made all along the line of matters bearing on the establishment of the boundary. Observations were made at several triangulation stations for the purpose of extending it to a connection with points to be established on the actual boundary line. Field work was suspended on November 30: On June 1 1 the joint survey of this portion of the boundary was resumed, with Mr. A. J. Brabazon as the representative of the British Commissioner, and the remainder of the month was spent in a joint reconnaissance for triangulation along the lower portion of the St. Croix River and in building signals at the stations selected for the work.
AI.ASKA BOUNDARY.

The demarcation of the boundary between Alaska and Canada along the one hundred and forty-first meridian was continued, as provided in the convention between the Up.ited States and Great Britain (signed April 21, 1906), by Mr. 0. H. Tittmann, the Commissioner representing the United States, and Mr. W. F. King, the Commissioner representing Great Britain. Messrs. G. C. Baldwin and A. J. Brabazon represented the Commissioners in the field, and they succeeded in extending the location of the line 70 miles to the _southward, or to a point near White River, and 195 miles south of the Yukon River. Low water delayed the party in reaching the working ground, and the season for work was unusually short. Marks were established and left on the summits and at other places for the use of the surveying and monumenting party which was following the line party. Mr. Baldwin's report contains a brief description of the cotlntry traversed by the line, and an account of the many obstacles which it was necessary to surmount and which taxed the endurance of the party severely. In June this party resumed work on the boundary, starting at the point where it crosses the Yukon River, and on the 30th was locating and opening the line to the northward. Mr. Thomas Riggs, jr., had charge of the party engaged in making the survey along the boundary, as established by the "line" party mentioned above. This work was in progress on July 1, and it was continued until September 17. The party was divided into three sections, one of which made a· reconnaissance for the triangulation and built signals; another made the observations of angles, and the third made a topographic survey along the line. The triangulation was extended 77 miles and reached a point 138 miles south of the Yukon River before August 26, when .it was necessary to close worlc for the season. The topographic work was extended south-

ward 64 miles, and it was suspended on September 17 at a point about 35 miles north of the end of the triangulation. The transportation of outfit and supplies in this region is a problem very difficult to solve, and credit is due the party for hardships endured and for their success in overcoming the many obstacles found in this unexplored territory. The work was resumed on May 23, and had inade considerable progress before June 30, on which date two sections of the party were engaged on topographic work, one on reconnaissance and one on triangulation. In southeastern Alaska a party in charge of Mr. 0. M. Leland was at work on July 1 in the vicinity of Unuk River, engaged on the demarcation of the boundary. No definite information in regard to the region crossed by the boundary in this locality could be obtained in advance, and consequently the party was divided into three sections to ascend the Unuk and Leduc rivers and Lake Creek, to explore the region and gain information for use in the next season's work, and to accomplish as much work as possible under the conditions found to exist. Boundary peak 6650 was identified and marked with a copper bolt. Observations were made at this point. A vista 20 feet wide was opened along the boundary across Leduc Valley. Boundary peak 6450 was identified and a signal was erected, and peak 5800 was identified. The line was traced between peaks 6200 and 6500 across two forks of Blue River. Work was suspended in the latter part of September and resumed in the following May (8). On June 30 the three sections of the party were established in camp in the vicinity of the boundary at the points mentioned above and the work was in progress. A party, under charge of Mr. Fremont Morse ,was engaged on work in connection with the demarcation of the boundary in the vicinity of the Alsek River on July 1, and the work continued until September 10. A base line was measured and an azimuth and the latitude of a station were determined. Triangulation was extended, up the river to the boundary, and the position of a point on the boundary was established as the adjacent boundary· peaks were not visible from the Alsek Valley or from the accessible mountains near the river. The geographic positions of the adjacent peaks, 5800 and 7450, had been previously determined, and the azimuth of the line between them was deduced and used in establishing the point on the boundary. A vista was cut through the dense growth of bushes on the slopes of the mountains on both sides of the river and through the trees near the river. This vista extends nearly a mile south of the river and more than a mile north of the river. Four monuments were placed in position on the boundary, two south and two north of the river. A number of negatives were made, with photo-topographic cameras, along the line for the purpose of preparing topographic maps. · Progress was also made in the demarcation of the boundary by two Canadia:n parties accompanied by representatives of the United States Commissioner.

DETAILS OF OFFICE OPERATIONS.
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE.
ANDREW BRAID,

Assistant in Charge.

The Assistant in Charge of the Office has direct supervision of the work of the different divisions of the Office. The Miscellaneous Section is a part of the immediate office of the Assistant in Charge.
COMPUTING DIVISION.

In the Computing Division unusual progress was made in the preparation of the results of field work for publication. These results can not be fully utilized by engineers and other interested persons until they are print~d and thus made known and widely distributed. The number of geographic positions prepared in answer to requests for information was greater than during any previous year and the number of descriptions of stations and of bench marks was less than for the previous year. The output of the Division in the form of correspondence is still slowly increasing. The preparation of a publication entitled "Precise Leveling in the United States, 19<>3-I907, with a Readjustment of the Level Net and Resulting Elevations," was completed, and the proof was read. The preparation of a publication entitled "The Figure of the Earth and Isostasy, from Measurements in the United States," was also completed, and proof reading was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. This publication is an important contribution to the progress of geodesy because the methods of computation and investigation are somewhat novel and have been found to be effective, and the resulting determination of the figure and size of the earth is of a very high degree of accuracy (probably higher than has yet been attained by any one nation). The investigation has already established the fact that in and around the United States the condition called "isostasy" exists. . The computations connected with a second detennination of the figure and size of the earth by the same method were nearly completed. In this determination one and one-half times as many observations are used as in the first detennination and the area covered is considerably larger. The computation of the astronomic observations made in I908 was completed, and an adjustment was made of the main triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian from Page, Nebr., to the Canadian boundary, including the connection with the Lake Survey triangulation at Duluth. ·

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909.

An adjustment was also made of the main triangulation from Marysville, Cal., to 'Tacoma, Wash., and thence to Port Townsend, and westward along Juan de Fuca Strait to the entrance, and northward to the Canadian boundary.
DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

The correspondence prepared in this Division shows an increase of more than 30 per cent. This is gratifying evidence of the growing appreciation of the useful work accomplished, as nearly all these letters were written in response to requests for information. The results of the observations made on land and at sea during the previous year were prepared for publication, and the Office revision of the results of observations made during the year were computed as they were received. The reduction of the observations made at the five magnetic observatories up to December 31, 1904, was completed, the results were prepared for publication, and the proof was read. Similar work was done for the· Cheltenham (Md.) Observatory for the years 1905 and IC)06, and these results were also prepared for publication. The reduction of the observations at Sitka, Aiaska, for 1905 was completed, and progress was made in bringing the reduction of·the observations at the other observatories up to date. The ".United States Magnetic Tables and Charts for 1905" and a reprint of the "Principal Facts of the Earth's Magnetism," with additions,· were sent to the printer and the proof was read. , Tabulations were made of the earthquakes recorded at Cheltenham, Md.; Vieques, P.R.; and at Honolulu during 1908, and at Sitka, Alaska, during the four years 1905-. 1908, and copies were furnished to the International Seismological Association. All available declination results in and near Alaska, both on land and at sea, were tabulated, reduced to a common epoch, and plotted in the preparation of a new isogonic chart of the Territory.
TIDAL DIVISION.

Harmonic analyses were completed for 8 stations with a combined length of 5 yens and 6 months. Nonharmonic reductions were made for 200 stations with a combined length of 28 years and 11 months. Mean sea level was computed for 18 stations with a combined length of 14 years. High and low waters and hourly heights of the sea were tabulated for 199 stations with a combined length of 39 years. There were received, examined, and registered in this Division records from 39 self-registering tide-gauge stations with a· combined length of 19 years, together with staff-gauge records from 98 stations with a combined length of 6~ years. The total of" all tide observations made by the Survey and received during the year is 25 years at 137 stations, and from other sources 21 years at 25 s~ations, making . a grand total of 46 years at 162 stations. The following is a list of the sources from which tide observations were received from outside parties during the year: 1. United States Army Engineers, tides in United States, 10 stations, IO years; Canal Zone, 2 stations, 2 years; Philippine Islands, I station, 2 months.

The Philippine government, tides at 2 stations, 2 years. 5. Alaska Boundary Survey, tides at Skagway, 9 months. The Tide Tables for 1910 were completed, sent to the printer, and the proof was read. Progress was made in the preparation of the Tide Tables for l 9 l I. At the request of the German Ambassador at Washington the Hydrographic Office at Wilhelmshaven, Germany, was furnished the predicted tides for 1910 at Sandy Hook, N. Y.; Baltimore, Md.; Charleston, S. C.; and San Francisco, Cal., in advance of

~~-

.

By request of the secretary of the marine department of New Zealand, the predicted tides at Wellington and Auckland, New Zealand, for 1910, were sent to him in advance of publication.
. DRAWING AND ENGRAVING DIVISION.

The Division is divided into five sections-the Drawing, the Engraving, the Printing, the Photographing, and the Electrotyping sections. Each section does the work indicated by its title, and the combined results are shown on the charts published and issued by the Survey. Cooperation with the Light-House Board in compiling information for the Notice to Mariners was continued during the year, and since January 1, 1909, the weekly Notice to Mariners has been a joint compilation and publication of the LightHouse Board and tl!e Coast and Geodetic Survey, which is issued by the Light-House Board. All work necessary in connection with this notice is done iii the Division. A new electrotyping plant was installed during the previous fiscal year, and some modifications have been made. It is now in successful operation, and can be operated day and night without the use of a storage battery, as it has automatic safeguards. The scheme for general charts of the Philippine Islands was revised and the general plan outlined received the approval of the officer in charge of the work of charting the archipelago. · ·

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909.
CHART DIVISION.

A new edition of the chart catalogue was prepared for the printer and the Table of Depths in the Harbors of the United States was brought up to date. The total issue of charts was I 1 per cent larger than during the previous year, and the correspondence showed an increase of 6 per cent. The charts were sold by I 63 agents and at the office in Washington. Charts were received as follows from the Drawing and Engraving Division:

All the work in connection with the sale 9f charts is done in this Division. issue of charts was larger than during any previous year.
INSTRUMENT DIVISION.

The

In this Division an account was kept of all instrunients and general property owned by the Survey or purchased during the year, except articles carried on the inventory of the Office at Washington. All necessary repairs were made to instruments used by the Survey. Minor repairs were made to the Office buildings and furniture. The construction work on the new tide-predicting machine was almost completed, but considerable time will be required to finish and adjust all of the thousands of parts of which it is composed, owing to the pressure ~f what may be called current work, which leaves very little time to be devoted to this work. Typical instruments were prepared and sent to the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition at Seattle, Wash., as an exhibit to illustrate the methods of work used by the Survey. The zenith telescope at the International Latitude Station at Gaithersburg, Md., was taken apart and cleaned. · Specifications were prep::i-red for cast-iron monuments to be used in marking the United States and Canada boundary, and the patterns for their construction were inspected at St. Paul, Minn. A number of aluminum-bronze monuments for marking the same boundary were inspected at Pittsburg, Pa.

LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES.

The current routine work was kept up to date. The records of observations made in the field were indexed as they were received. The author and subject catalogue of the library was compJeted. A list of the books, pamphlets, and articles in the library on seismology was compiled. Detailed information relating to the leading subjects covered by the library was prepared at the request of the Bureau of Education for publication under the title "Facilities for Study and Research in the Offices of the United States Government at Washington." During the year photographic reproductions of the original maps of the international survey of the boundary between the United States and the British possessions in North America, between the headwaters of the St. Croix River and the Lake of the Woods, and of the United States and British field notes of the same survey from the headwaters of the St. Croix River to the intersection of the forty-fifth parallel of north latitude with the St. J,awrence River, were deposited in the archives. These copies were made from the original records in the British foreign office to replace American recot"ds which were destroyed.

REsULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY BETWEEN JULY l, 1908, AND JUNE 30, 1909.
By R. L.
FARIS,

Inspector of Magnetic Work; Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Suniey.

INTRODUCTION.

The present publication contains the results of magnetic observations made on land and at sea by officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the prosecution of the magnetic survey of the United States and outlying territories during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1909. There are also included some results obtained in the preceding fiscal year, not heretofore published. · Five magnetic observatories have been in continuous operation throughout the year-at Cheltenham, Md.; Baldwin, Kans.; Sitka, Alaska; near Honolulu, Hawaii, and on Vieques Island, Porto Rico. There will be found in the tables the values of the magnetic elements at each of the observatories, based on the observatio_ns of December and January.
OBSERVATIONS ON LAND AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

The distribution of the stations on land is shown in the following table, from which it will be seen that observations were made during the year in 34 States and Territories. Especial attention was directed to increasing the number of stations in the middle of the country-in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Tennessee, and Kentucky-in anticipation of the discontinuance of the magnetic observatory at Baldwin, Kans., in the near future. Numerous old stations were reoccupied in order to determine the change of the magnetic elements since the former occupation.

SECULAR CHANGE OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION.

1\ comparison o{ the declination results at "repeat" stations occupied during the year with the results of earlier observations in the same localities is presented in the following table. The letters after the names of stations indicate (a) that the old station was reoccupied exactly, (b) that the two stations were very near together, and (c) that the new station was some distance (quarter of a mile or more) from the old one. A tabular value of annual change refers approximately to the middle of the period from which it is deduced. A plus sign indicates increasing east declination or decreasing west declination, and a minus sign the reverse. The resulting values of annual change show no radical difference from those given in Magnetic Tables and Magnetic Charts for 1905, based on a discussion in 1906 of all data available at that time, but they do indicate that along the Atlantic coast west declination is increasing somewhat more rapidly than was expected in 1906, and that west of the Mississippi east declination is increasing more rapidly than was expected.

OBSERVATIONS AT SEA AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

Magnetic observations have been made at sea as often as the regular surveying work of the ships of the Bureau would permit. Results were secured by the Bache going and returning from her winter working ground in Porto Rico and her summer working ground off the coast of Massachusetts and by the Patterson and Explorer returning from Alaska in the fall of 1908 and going to Alaska in the spring of 1909. Compass observations were also made on the Gedney in the spring of 1909 between Seattle. and her working ground in southeastern Alaska.

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS. METHODS OF OBSERVING.
LAND WORK.

81

The methods of observing have been the same as those followed in previous years. Observers engaged exclusively in magnetic work are supplied with a complete outfit, consisting of theodolite magnetometer, dip circle, half-second pocket chronometer, observing tent, and small accessories, while those who are expected to get magnetic results in~dental to other work are supplied with more or less complete outfits, according to circumstances. Where only declination results can be secured under the conditions involved, a compass declinometer is supplied, but to those who can attempt more a dip circle with compass attachment is furnished, with which compact outfit, knowing the azimuth of some reference mark from triangulation or other source, the declination, dip, and total intensity (by Lloyd's method) can be obtained with a fair degree of accuracy.
SEA WORK.

The Bache, Explorer, and Patterson are each provided with a Lloyd-Creak dip circle and accompanying gimbal stand, by means of which dip and total intensity can be determined on board ship. The Explorer and Patterson are also provided with a magnetometer, so that the "intensity constant" of the dip circle may be determined at each place where shore observations are made. Observations for declination are made with the usual standard liquid compass and an azimuth circle of Ritchie or Negus pattern. A value of declination, dip, or intensity usually depends upon the mean of observations made on 8 or 16 equidistant headings while steaming in a circle, once with port and once with starboard helm. In some cases, however, observations are made on three headings and the results are corrected for the effect of the ship's magnetism by comparison with · the observations made while swinging ship.
ACCURACY OF RESULTS.

The endeavor in general is to secure, on land, declination and dip observations whose absolute error (including everything involved-error of observation and reduction) shall not exceed 2', and to determine the horizontal intensity within 1 part in 1 ooo. As stated in previous reports, the experience of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has been that, under all of the conditions involved in a campaign of field work covering a large area, including the standardization of instruments and the determination of reduction corrections, this accuracy can not be much increased. In observatory work with special · instruments, or when special investigations are made under the best conditions by special observers, there is no difficulty of reducing these limits of error, but in a large organization, where results must be secured from all kinds of observers, under all conditions, and at times under physical difficulties, and when all sources 'of error are considered, the degree of accuracy stated must be regarded as satisfactory· and sufficient. Jt happens, of course, that these limits, for one reason or another, are occasionally exceeded, and there may be a few isolated cases in which the errors are two or three times the amounts given.

MAGNETOMETERS.

1909.

'During the year all but two of the field magnetometers were compared with the standard instrument at the Cheltenham magnetic observatory, the results indicating that no changes are required to the corrections adopted in 1908 as a result of a least square adjustment of magnetometer comparisons from 1901 to 1907.* As was pointed out last year,* the corrections for horizontal intensity are nearly all positive, indicating that the adopted standard is too high by about 1 part in l ooo. The standard magnetometer at Cheltenham is a large observatory instrument made by Edelmann according to Wild's design. The intensity magnet is a solid cylinder 8 cm long and 1.4 cm in diameter. A suspension ring fitting snugly about the center of the magnet is attached to the suspension wire by means of a split stem. The constants of the magnetometer were determined in 1902 at Cheltenham. The moment of inertia of the intensity magnet was obtained with the aid of an inertia bar, and· also directly by computation from the dimensions of the magnet and suspension ring. The result obtained by the latter method was adopted, although it is greater than that obtained by the former method by about 3 parts in 1 ooo, because Wild gives it as his experience with this type of instrument that the direct method is the more accurate one. During the past year two additional indirect determinations of the moment of inertia have been made, one with the aid of a small mass-ring which has been used with several of the smaller magnetometers and the other with a specially constructed ring of about two-thirds the mass of the magnet. The result in each case agreed very closely with the value obtained in 1902 using an inertia bar of about the same mass as the magnet. If the smaller value of the moment of inertia was used it would reduce the horizontal intensity results by 0.0015 H and bring the Cheltenham magnetometer into closer agreement with the average of the field magnetometers. The difference is too small, however, to warrant making a change in the adopted standard. Accordingly the magnetometer corrections which were adopted in 1908 have been applied to the results given in this publication. Corrections to magnetometers.

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.
DIP INSTRUMENTS.

Several dip circles have been compared with the standard earth inductor at Cheltenham during the year, and as a result some changes are required in the corrections used last year. Dip circle No. 24 has a large and variable correction. From comparisons with other dip instruments at numerous places from Porto Rico to Sitka, Alaska, the· following formula has been deduced, which represents closely the change in the correction with change in dip and total intensity:

F JI=+ 7'.46+I1'.83 cos (/ + 36°.9)

REDUCTION OF OBSERVATIONS.

A first computation is made by the observer in the field, and he is instructed to ~arry it far enough before he leaves a station to assure himself that the desired degree of accuracy has been attained. This computation is carefully revised in the Office, in the Division of Terrestrial Magnetism, and the necessary corrections are applied to reduce the results to the standard instruments, as indicated in the foregoing section. Each value of the magnetic declination is then corrected to reduce it to the mean of the particular month in which the observation was made, with the aid of the continuous observations at the nearest observatory, allowance being made for the change in diurnal range with change in magnetic latitude. No attempt has been made to correct the dip and horizontal intensity results for diurnal variation.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909. ARRANGEMENT OF TABLES.
LAND OBSERVATIONS.

The values of declination, dip, and horizontal intensity presented in Table I are arranged by States alphabetically, the results for each State being given in the order of increasing latitudes. The latitudes and longitudes are in most cases the result of solar observations made with the small theodolite which forms a part of the magnetometer. In default of observations the geographic coordinates were scaled from the best available map, either a topographic sheet of the United States Geological Survey, a post-route map, or some other State. map. In such cases only the nearest whole minute of latitude and longitude is given: The horizontal intensity is expressed in terms of the one hundredthousandth part of a C.G.S. unit of intensity of magnetic force, termed a gamma, and designated by the Greek letter T· In order to include the desired amount of information in the available space the following abbreviations have been adopted. Only the month and day of the date are given, since the observations were all made between July ·1, 1908, and June 30, 1909, except when otherwise stated in a foot note. The names of the months have been abbreviated as follows:

In the column headed "Instruments" M stands for "magnetometer" and D.C. for "dip circle." .Italicised numbers in the magnetometer column indicate that the declination was determined with a compass declinometer or with the compass of a theodolite. When the declination was determined with the compass attachment of the dip circle, the letter C is placed in the magnetometer column. The dip circles have been given the designations indicated on page 83,· the figures after the decimal point denoting the needles used. Values of horizontal intensity printed in italics were obtained by combining the observed dip with the total intensity determined with the dip circle by Lloyd's method.

DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS. Magnetic ob;;ervers are instructed to mark every station in as permanent a manner as possible, either with a stone or a post of some durable wood, so that it may be available for future occupation. They are also required to furnish a sufficiently detailed description to locate the station, even if the marking should be destroyed, and to determine the bearing of two or three prominent objects in addition to the one used as reference mark in the azimuth and declination observations. The information is· given in abridged form on the following pages for each of the stations occupied during the ·year. Further details can usually be obtained upon application to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The usual method of marking a station is by a stone post about 3 feet long and 6 or 8 inches square, set so as to project an inch or two above ground and lettered on top U. S. C. & G. S., with a drill hole in the center to mark the exact point. Whenever the local authorities desired, and were willing to bear the expense, a second · stone was set to denote th~ true meridian. The descriptions are arranged alphabetically by States and by names of stations.

Company's buildings and is 75 paces back from a few graves on the first shoulder of the same hill. It is about 100 feet above the river. The town of Andreafski is on the Andreafski River, 2 miles up from its confluence with the Yukon River. Between the town and the hill on which the station is located is a small stream of water. The station is marked ·by a spruce post 4 inches in diameter and 36 inches long, projecting 8 inches above the surface of the ground. The post is lettered U. S. and bas a rifle shell driven in the center of top. The following true bearings were determined:

DISTRIBUTION OF THE MAGNETIC .DECLINATION IN ALASKA AND ADJACENT REGIONS FOR 1910.
INTRODUCTION. The distribution of the magnetic declination over a given area is best represented by an isogonic chart on which are drawn lines of equal magnetic declination, each line passing through all the places at which the declination is the same. In practice, since the observations are necessarily more or less widely distributed, it seldom happens that the observed values of the magnetic declination are identical at more than a very few places; but the position of any desired isogonic line may be determined approximately by interpolation between the observed values. For performing this interpolation either a graphical or an analytical method may be· employed. The analytical method consists in deriving by the method of least squares a formula in which the declination is expressed in terms of the latitude and longitude. This method is usually employed where the observations are few in number and widely distributed, or where it is desired to determine for a limited area the uniform distribution most nearly approximating the observed facts. The resulting isogonic lines are necessarily smooth curves, uniformly distributed. ·The graphical method consists in plotting the declination results on a map and drawing the isogonic lines to conform as nearly as possible to the plotted values. In this way it is possible to give a general idea of the irregularities of distribution and to show the presence of local disturbances. The first isogonic chart of Alaska was prepared in 1883 for the epoch 1885. This was necessarily only a rough approximation, owing to the small number of available results and the uncertainty of the reduction to epoch. In l 889 a new isogonic chart, for 1890, was published, but it was based on very nearly the same data as the 1885 chart. In the succeeding five years many new observations were made and our knowledge of the secular change of declination was very much increased. Consequently, the chart for 1895, constructed in 1894, represented a decided improvement over those that had preceded it. In l 895 a chart for l 900 was prepared by shifting the isogonic lines of the 1895 · chart to correspond with the predicted change in declination for the five-year interval. In 1902 a comparison of the results of observations made between 1894 and 1902 with the 1900 chart indicated that little, if any, change was required in the position of the isogonic lines to adapt them to the year l 902. All of these isogonic charts were constructed by the analytical method, using a formula involving the first and second powers of the latitude and longitude, since the observations were too widely distributed to attempt to show more than the general distribution of declination. At the present time so much additional data has become
153

available that it is now possible to make use of the graphical method and show some of the irregularities of distribution, at least in southeastern Alaska. The observations reveal the prevalence of local disturbance all along the coast from Cape Muzon to St. Michael. It is especially marked at a number of places in southeastern Alaska, sufficient in amount to affect the compasses of passing steamers. (Coast Pilot of Alaska, Part I, p. 1 2.) The most remarkable of these areas of local disturbance occurs on Douglas Island, near Juneau, where special observations made in I 904 revealed the presence of a local magnetic pole, at which point the needle lost its directive property and toward which, within a very limited area, the needle pointed from every direction. St. George Island in Bering Sea was also found to be a highly disturbed region, when obseryations were made there in I 897. These areas of extreme local disturbance are in general too limited in extent to be shown on a map of the scale suitable for an isogonic chart. The limits adopted for the new isogonic chart of Alaska are somewhat different from those of the earlier ones. It still extends far enough to the east and south to join on to the isogonic chart of the United States, but it has been contracted on the west, because of the lack of reliable data along the coast of Asia. The scale of the present chart has been changed from that of the former ones, so that it is now about four times the size of the previous isogonic charts of Alaska. SECULAR CHANGE OF DECLINATION. January l, 1910, has been adopted as the epoch of the isogonic chart and all results have been reduced to that date. Where the same station has been occupied more than once, only the most recent value has been used, but where several stations in the same locality have been occupied at different times, the different results are given. No attempt has been made to use results of observations made prior to 1870, on account of the uncertainty of the reduction to 1910. For determining the secular change of declination since 1870 the results tabulated below are available. For earlier observations at Sitka, Port Etches, Kodiak, Unalaska, and Port Clarence, see Appendix 1, Report for 1895. For each station the tabulated values were plotted on cross-section paper and a smooth curve drawn to correspond approximately with the plotted values. The correction to reduce an observation to ·the year 1910 was then obtained by taking the difference between the ordinate at the date of observation and the 1910 ordinate. For stations where observations were made only at two dates, the annual change was assumed to be uniform during the interval. For convenience a table has been prepared for each "repeat" station giving the reduction to 1910 at five-year intervals. For observations at other than ''repeat" stations, the reduction to 1910 was obtained by interpolation between the'' repeat'' station values. The use of the symbols (a), (b), (c), etc., after the name of the observer in the following tables indicates the organization to which the observer belongs. (See ·explanations, p. 163).
SITKA.

Most of the magnetic observations in the vicinity of Sitka have been made at three stations: (r) Japonski Island, where the Russfans maintained a magnetic observatory from 1842 to 1867; (2) Parade ground in front of the Presbyterian Church; (3) Absolute building of the Coast and Geodetic Survey magnetic observatory. A magnetic survey of Sitka and vicinity in 1901 developed a very uniform distribution of magnetism, the

magnetic declination being 9' .5 greater at the site of the absolute observatory than on Japonski Island, and 3'.7 greater than at the parade ground. These corrections have been applied in the following table. Where a number of observations were made in the same year, only the mean value is given. The values beginning with 1902 are observatory results. In the diagram which follows the table (fig. 1) the tabular values are shown by dots.

DUTCH HARBOR.

Several stations have been occupied in the vicinity of Dutch Harbor at different times. In 1867 Assistant Mosman observed at the end of the spit at. the eastern entrance to Captain's (now Dutch) Harbor, in cf>=53° 54'.o and A=166° 3o'.9. ln 1871, 1873, 1874, and 1880 Messrs. Dall and Baker observed at the astronomic station on Amaknak Island, just across from Iliuliuk village (now. Unalaska) cf>= 53 e> 52 1 .9; A= 166° 32 1 .3. . In, 1883 R. A. Marr observed at a point about 8 feet south of this.astronomic station.

In 1889 J. E. McGrath's station was 267.9 feet northwest of what was supposed to be the location of the old station of Dall and Baker. At the same time J. H. Turner made observations at a point 257.1 feet east of the old station. He reoccupied this station in 1891, as did 0. B. French in 1896. In his records of 1891, Mr. Turner says: "Basaltic rock underlying the surface may possibly affect magnetic measures made in this region." In 1900 Dutch Harbor had become the more convenient anchorage for vessels, and in that year a new station w:1:s established near the village of Dutch Harbor, at the "Azimuth Mark" erected in connection with the astronomic observations of 1896 in

cp=53° 53'.4 and A=166° 32'.1. This station has been in use up to 1908. In that year observatiOns were also made at a n.umber of places about the bay, one of which, South Base, is only a short distance from Mr. Mosman's station of .1867. The observations of Dall and Baker show an annual decrease in declination of 2'.8 from 1873 to 1880. Observations at Turner's station give- an annual decrease of 4' .5 from 1889 to 1896. Observations at the Dutch Harbor station give an annual decrease of 4'.7 from 1900 to 1908. Assuming station South Base of 1908 to be comparable with Mosman's station of 1867, the average annual decrease for that interval is 3'.9, which is very nearly the average of the values for the shorter periods.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909.

Assuming an annual decrease of 4'.5 from 1896 to 1900, observations at Turner's station (1889-1896) require a correction of + 50'.5 to reduce to the Dutch Harbor station. Assuming an annual decrease of 3'.5 from 1880 to 1889, observations at the old astronomic station (1871-1880) must be increased by 6'.5 to reduce to Turner's station and hence require a correction of + 57 1 .o to reduce to the Dutch Harbor station. From observations in 1908, results at South Base must be increased by 31'.o to reduce to Dutch Harbor station. This correction will be used for the 1867 value. The reduced values are given in the following table: Magnetic declination at Dutch Harbor.

COAST AND .GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1909.

From the foregoing tables it will be seen that. the secular change of the magnetic declination is well determined for the past forty years at Sitka, Kodiak, and Dutch Harbor, and fairly well at St. Michael since 1880. At Kiska the three stations occupied in 1904 show little local disturbance and the comparison with the 1873 value is therefore probably reliable. On St. Paul Island there is no doubt local disturbance. The results at the stations along the Yukon River near the international boundary indicate that there has been little change in declination in that region since 1887. The following table has therefore been used for reducing to the common epoch, 1910, the observations in Alaska and vicinity:

TABLE OF MAGNETIC DECLINATIONS. The following table contains the values of magnetic declination used in the construction of the isogonic chart. Principal dependence has been placed on the observations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, but all available sources have been drawn upon for results of observations in the area covered by the chart. For convenience the results have been divided into several groups, as follows:

APPENDIX 4.

MAGNETIC DECLINATION IN ALASKA.

In groups 4, 5, and 7 the results are arranged in order of longitude. For the sake of uniformity all longitudes in the tables are expressed as west of Greenwich. In the other groups the arrangement is by latitude, beginning with the most southerly station. In the column headed "Source" a very brief reference is made to the publication or other source from which a result was derived. Fuller references are given below to supplement those in the table. The results of magnetic observations by the Coast and Geodetic Survey up to 1881, together with descriptions of stations, were published as Appendix 9 to the Report of the Superintendent for 1881. These as well as later results are contained in United States Magnetic Declination Tables for 1902, together with descriptions of the new stations occupied between 1881 and 1902. This publication also contains results from other sources, at that time available. Beginning with 1903, the results of magnetic observations made during each fiscal year and descriptions of the stations occupied have been published as an appendix to the Annual Report for that year. (App. 5, 1903; App. 3, 1904; App. 3, 1905; App. 3, 1906; App. 5, 1907; App. 3, 1908; App. 3, 1909.) Results obtained by the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington are referred to as Carnegie Institution. The results of observations made by parties of the United States Geological Survey engaged in exploring the interior of Alaska have been published in the Annual Report of the Director for 1899 and in its various other publications. Results obtained by officers attached to ships of the United States Navy, both on land and on shipboard, were published in Hydrographic Office Publication No. 109 (H. 0. 109). Later results have been furnished in manuscript (U. S. N. MSS.). Results obtained by officers attached to ships of the British navy between 1890 and 1900 were published in 1901 by the Hydrographic Department of the British Admiralty. (B. A., 1901.) Later results were published in 1905, 1907, and 1908 (B. A., 1905; B. A., 1907; B. A., 1908). Some results obtained by Canadian surveyors, not included in the declination tables, were published in the Annual Report of the Interior Department of Canada for 1898. They have been corrected for diurnal variation, so far as possible. A number of results were secured in the summer of 1908 by the party engaged in .running out the one hundred and forty-first meridian boundary between Alaska and British North America. These have been combined in five groups. In the secular change tables in the column headed "Observer," and in the declination tables in the column headed "Source,'' a letter follows the name of the observer or source to indicate the organization or department under whose direction the observations were made, viz: (a) Observations made by observers of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. (b) Observations made by observers of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. (c) Observations made by observers in the employ of the Canadian government. (d) Observations made by officers of the United States Navy. (e) Observations made by officers of the British navy.
