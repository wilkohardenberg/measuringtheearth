PREFATORY NOTE RELATING TO A CHANGE IN THE FORM OF THIS ILEPORT,

The Beport of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year 1891 is the first one in which the text was arranged for publication in two parts. P a r t I1 of that report, as well as P a r t I1 of the reports for the years 1802 atid 1803, mas published in octavo, while the quarto form mas retained for P a r t I. It was thought advantageous to publish both parts of this report for the year ending June 30,1894, in. quarto, and the change has accordingly been made. P a r t I contains the historical portion. It states the progress in field and office \vork, gives estimates for future progress, and a report of expenditures for the fiscal year. It is aucompanied by maps of general progress, and by progress sketches more i11 detail. P a r t I1 includes the professional papers relating to the ~nethods, discussions, :tnd results of the Survey which have been approved for publication during the year, such il1ustrations as are needed accompanying them. Part I being of less general inkrest than P a r t 11, in the future distribution of t,he Report Part I1 only will be sent, except in special cases. W. W. D U ~ J W ~ E ~ D , 8uperinte?iden2.

RELATIVE DETERMINATIONS OF GRAVITY WITH HALF-SECOND PENDULUM8, AND OTHER PENDULUM INVESTIGATIONS.

By O. R. P~;TNAJI, Amistnnt. Submittocl for publication January 23, 1895.

The following report includes the results of various investigations carried out by tlie writor undor the direction of Dr. T. C . Xendenhall. Tlleso are considered under the following heads: 1. Relative mo?surements of gravity a t twenty-six stations in tho United States. 1 1 . Observa. tions with quarter-second pondulums, and special 1,endulum investigations. 1 1 1 . Telegraphic comparisous between base stations in Washington, D. C. IV. Summary of the connections between American and European gravity stations by nloaris of relative 1)endnlum observations, and the reductioli of absolute determinations of gmrity to Washington. There is also included in this roport, as b e i ~ ~ intimately g connected wit11 tho other work described, (V) a translation of an illtcresting paper by Comrnandaut Defforges, of tlie '' Service. GBographiquev of France, giving an outline of the resnlts of his recent measurements in North America. A copy of this paper was sent tq tlio Supcrintende~itby Commandant Defforges, and i t has since been published* in France. The :~bsolute determination a t Washington was mado by order of General Durrbcagais, Director of the " Service Ofiogmphique," in courteous response to the request of the Superintendent, tho elaborate instrnmental o ~ ~ t fbeing it sent h w n Paris especially for this purpose. ' TIie writer desires to acknowledge his indebtedness to Mr.. C'. A. Schott, Mr. E. D. Preston, and Mr. 0. El. Tittmann, of tho Coast and Goodetic Survey, for their valnablc advice in colinoction with tho preparation of this report.
I.-RELATIVE MEASURISMENTS O F GRAVI'PY AT TWENTY-SIX STATlONS 1K TIIIS UNITED STATES.

Six of tliese doterlni~iations mere made a t various times iu the spring of 1894, and tho remaining twenty in a transcontinental series estending west from Washington to U t ; d (luring tlio summer of the same year, the whole forming the first extended series of gravity measnrements carried out in the United States. As shown on tlie accompanying map (fig.4), the greater part of tho st,ations are in the neighborliood of the thirty-iiintli parallel of latitude, following tlie gelleral course of tlie transcontinental triangulation ofthe Snrrey and including lnany of it's astronomically determined points. This lilie of gravity stations, commencing a t tho Atlantic coast, rises to near tlie crest of the Appalachian ridge, traverses the great smooth ceutral pli~in, inc:ressing in altitude gradually fro111 151 metres to 1.841 inotres; then risos to the high elevations of tlio main chain of tho Rocky Mountains, reaching an1 altitude of 4285 metres a t Pikes Peak, doscericis into tile eroded valleys of the Gr:u~dand Green rivers, crosses the summit of the IVasatch ridge, and finally descends to the great wcstern plateau of tho continent. The wide variety of orograpliic features thus tr:~vorsed so nearly in the same latitude makes this series peculiarly well aditptecl to throw light on tho continental variatiol~s of gravity, on the question of the proper method of reduction to sea Ievol, of utmost importance in c:ounection with tlie application of gravity n~casnrementsto the geodetic problem of the figure of the earth, as we11 as on tho questions of t,he llwturo rtlld condition of the --.. -- -. .- - . ... . . .. . -. *"Comptes Rondtls d u 1'Ac:tdbnlio tles Sciouces," Jnnuory 29, 1894.

earth's crust. Several stations were included on account of peculiar features of their location, ad, for instance, three points in the Yellowstone Park, because here only in the United States summit of Pikes Peak was (exclusive of Alaska) are found tlie last signs of volcanic 'activity. T l ~ e occupied riot only for the sake of including a station of considerable altitude, but also because a comparison of this result wit11 that obtained a t Colorado Springs, near the base of the mountain, affords tlie data for coniputing the mean clensity of the earth. With the exception of Mor6, in India, this is the most elevated gravity station yet dctermincd with modern methods. Iiiciderltal to tho work, and as furnishing the most convenient facilities, observations wero in a number of instances inade a t educational institutions, which in return will receive desired information in regard to the relative value of an important physical constant. Thus also absolute xneasureme~its of gravity which may be carried out a t such institutions nlay be cou~parecl and ntilized elsewhere, and may bo referred to standard base stations for con~biuatiox~. Another and most i~nportant object contemplated in the recent work was to make a comparison of relative gravity results obtained with various kinds of apparatus arid diEerent lengths of pendulums. To this end there were inclucled four ststions visited by Commandant Defforges in 1893, who used a half-metre reversible pendulum. The two stations of Comlnandant Defforges on the Pacific Uoast had previously been determined by Dr. Meridenhall and Mr. Presto11 with the half-second (quarter-metre) invariable pendulnms, thus giving a comparison a t all of his stations in the United States. I n addition to the regular series of observations lnade a t each station of the past season with the Iialf-second pendulums, there was also carried along the quarter-second (onesixteenth metre) pendulum app:iratus designed by Dr. e end en hall and recently constructed. These pendulums were swung a t three stations, as well as a t Washington, before and after the trip. (See P a r t 11.) An interesting test of the wear of knife-edges, as well as of the accuracy of observation, was iriade by swinging the half-second pendulums (which carry a plane in the head and swing upon a knife-edge) upon 2x1 additional or standard edge a t Washington before and after the trip and a t two of the other stations. As the ordinary edge was in use four tirnes as long as the standard, valuable information was tlius o b t a i ~ ~ e on d the subject of wear. Further, tlie swings on the standard edge gave independent determinatiotis of gravity a t thest: stations, thus testixlg the reliability of tlie system of observi~lg. I n tho prosecution of this work the writer had the efficient assistance a t fifteen stations of Mr. 0.E. Mendenhall, Extra Observer, and a t three stations of Mr. S. B. Tinsley, Aid, while a t the remaining eight places tho work was conduoted without assistance. 111 selecting locations for the apparatus endeavor was made to obtain tho most Psvorablq conditiolls for observing, such as constant temperature, stable foundation for the l)ex~dulumcase, freedom from disturbing influences, and near proximity of the transit set up for time observations. To obtain such suitable places it was necessary to request the temporary nse of basement rooms or cellars in public or private buildings, or those belonging to corporations or colleges. These ratller unusual privileges were invariably grauted most freely and courteously, and i t is regretted that lack of space prevents the mentioning here of tho many persons who, by their kindliess in this respect or in the matter of furnishing valuable information and assistance, greatly aided the succe~sful prosecution of the work. Po8itio,z and description o f crtation8.-The latitudes and longitudes of the pendulum ~tlttions are mostly derived by connection with neighboring points whose geographical position had previously been determined by the Coast and Geodetic Survey or other good authority, either astronomically or geodetically. A t eight stations, Deer Park, Cleveland, Chicago, Lower Basin, Grand Canyon, Norris Basin, Pleasant Valley, aild Terre LIaute, the positions mere determined in connection with the pendulum work, the latitudes by observations on from two to four pairs of stars by Talcott's method, and the longitudes by transportation of two chronometers. The fact that a number of the other stations had been determined telegraphically gave a good opportunity of testing tho wcuracy of longitudes thus determined by carrying two chronoxneters on railway trains, and by other means of transportation. I 1 1 the seven cases where the chronometers were carried directly between telegraphic longitude stations tlie iliscordance between the telegraphic and the chronometric difference of longitudo ranges from 0.08 second (tirne) to 0.80 second, the average being 0.37 second, and the average distance traveled about 175 miles. The elevations are based on t l ~ e most accurate information available. For a majority of the

REPORT POlt 189A--PABT 11. interior stations they depend on the data given in Mr. Gannett's Dictionary of Altitudes in the United States. Additional information in regard to the elevation of Pikes Peak was furnished by Mr. Gannett. The elevations of the stations in the Yellomstone Park are based on information furnished by Maj. W. A. Jones, United States Engineers, from a line of levels run from Cinnabar, hlont. The pendulunl stations were in each case referred by hand level or otherwise to the railroad track, bench mark, or other known point. I n Inany casuv the writer is indebted to city engineers or college authorities for informamtion in regard to bench marks in the neighborhood of tlie station. The follo\ving (Table A ) is a brief description of the location of the pendulu~u stations and of the support for the pendulurn case a t each, together with the measured flexure of the case and support. Tho figures in the labt column represent the horizontal movelneut of the knife-edge when a force of 1.5 kilogramrnes was applied horizontally in the plane of oscillation. The latitudes, longitudes, and elevations will be found in Table E.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Instr?cments.-The apparatus used in the greater part of the work consisted of half-second pendulums, A 4, A 5, and A 6, witli the accolnpanyiiig air-tight receiver, flash apparatus, dummy or temperature pendulum, etc., sidereal break-circuit clironometers Negus 1833 and 1824, thennometers, air pump, dry cells, and, for use in time observations, a light observatory tent (a ridge-pole tent specially designed for the purpose and weighing only G 5 pounds), small meridian telescope aperture, 62111111; ~liagnifying power, 5O), light Saeg(for either time or latitbde, focal length, GCm; muller chronograph (weight about 50 pounds), and other accessories. Special attention mas paid to portability, and considerable reductions in weight were secured in the time outfit, and important gain in oconomy and labor. The entire apparatus, packed for shipment, weighed about 500 pounds (318 kilogrammes). The half-second pendnlum apparatus of tlie Survey has been fi~lly described and illustrated in United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1801, Appendix 16, since which time, however, i t has been.somewhat modified. A reversal of the usual relation of knife-edge and plane was made by Dr. Mendenhall, with the idea of obtaining greater invariability in the pendulum itself (see paper "On the use of lanes and knife-edges in pendulums for gravity measurements," American Journal of Science, XLV, page 144). Each of the new pendulums, A 4, A 5, and A 6, carries an agate plane in its head and swings upon an agate knife-edge which is inserted in a heavy brass plate resting on tho shelf in tlie receiver. The upper part of tho stem of the pendulum (fig. G A ) is forked, so that it passes beyond each end of the knife-edge, thus permitting both edge and plane to be sillgle pieces of agate. Experience proved that the dividing of tlie agate knife-edge or plane is objectionable as offering an o~portunity for the separated parts to be twisted out of the same plane by any strain in the surrounding metal. The plate in which tho knife-edge is embedded is not screwed rigidly to the shelf in the receiver, as formerly, but rests on three rounded steel projections in t l ~ i s fillelf, to which the plntc is fitted, and is held firmly ill place with a light screw. The agate lrnife-edge is formed by planes meeting a t an angle of 1300, and has a total bearing lehgtli of 19"In, being cut away in the center. A scale has been placed in the e ~ e end of tlle observing telescope, so that by holding tlie slit open and noting the rnovement of the image reflected by the pendulum mirror across the scale tho arc of oscillation may bo read directly'in mi~iutes as long as the arc is not large. Appliances have been provided for measuring statically the flexure of the support. A glass scale is mounted vertically above tlie knife-edge, adjiistable so that i t may be placed a t digerent lieiglits. With a weight, cord, pulley, and aluminum arm (to carry the tension over the edge of the receiver) a horizontal force in the plane of oscillation of tlle pendulum is applied directly behilid tlie knife-edge. By means of a, simple microscope, supported independently of the pier csrrying the receiver, magnifying 160 diameters, and provided with an eycpiece scale witli lines ha\ling an equivalent distance of 10 microns, the displacements of the scale above the knife-edge when tlie tension is'applied by su~pending the weight are noted to the nearest micron. The scale may be ohserved a t two or more heights above the knife-edge, and thus the movemelit a t tho edge estimated. The outside manometer and barometer, both troiiblesome additions, have been dispensed mitl~, consequent upon the adoption of lorn pressures. The air pressure is now obtained by a small manolneter set, in tlie pe~ldulumcase. This manometer was always transported in ,z vertical position so as to prevent air working into the closcd end. The Qametube was used throughout, and it was tested before and after tho ficld work and found corre6t. The same thermometer, Green GG04, mas used on the dummy pendulum a t all stations. I t s correctiolls as determilied by the Officeof Weiglits and Measures were applied to all readings. As a check, readings were also talren of another thermo~neterhanging in the air in the pendulum case. This thermometer invariably indicated the change of temperature, reading higher than the dummy thermo~neterml~elithe terriperature was rising, and lower when fi~llil~g. The new air pump for exliausti~lg the receiver weighs only about G pounds (2.7 kilogmn~mes). It is provided with a very ingenious self-packing piston, the invention of Mr. Fischer, Chief Mechanician. This piston, which is shown in fig. 1 by a section of a portion of the pump, is a 1e:itller cylinder stretched over a metal frame, with the liollow inside open to the outer air t h o u g h thc tnbulsr piston rod and handle. As soon as tlie air is partially exhausted from the pump

cylinder, which lias escape valves a t ~ W I Jend, the atmospheric pressure on the inside of the pistoll makes a perfect elastic packiug with lnir~imurufriction. The hollow Piston rod also fiirliislles a rcady means of lubrication,

Determination o f coeBcient8.-The effects on tho period of the pellduluni of changes of temperature and atmospheric density, and of various degrees of fioxihility of support, mere detormh~ed experimentally in January and ApriI, 1894. For this purpose penciulum B 4 was used as s standard to elimil~ete the rate of the chronometer, being smuug in an adjoiniug room under uniform conditions, while A 4, A 5, and A G mere successively swung under the various coliclitions desired to be chronometer investigated. Sinlultancous swings were made with the pendulums, using t,hc sall~e to operate both flash appa.ratuses by means of suitable electrical connectiollu. Tlie true period of B 4 being known, the diflorence from this of the observed period must be duo to rate of chronometer, which may therefore bo computed for each swing, and the resulting rate correction applied to the observations with A. This elegant comparative method of determining pendulum ooefflcients was first used by Airy and has more recently been employed by Von Storneck. Tho following is a summary of the reaults:

AS in the manner of making and reducing thege observations the pressure correction i s always a small quantity, no appreciable error can arise from treating i t as varying directly with the pressure. Flexure coeficient.-The eflect on the period of the pendulum of various degrees of flexibility of support was ascertained by determining the period under the different conditions (correcting for rate in the same manner as with the other coeficients), and measuring the flexure of the case and support statically with the'appliances already mentioned, all the observations being made with pendulum A 4.

The amount of flexure encountered in actual work will in general be so small as to render ra slight uncertainty in this coefficierit i~lal)prcciable. A t the twenty-six stations where masonry supports were used i t ranged from 0.5 microns to 8.0 microns, with weight of 1.5 kilogrammes. A t a single station where it \\-as tiecessary to use wooden support it was as high as 18 microns. Method o f observation.-Several modifications were made by tho writer in the method of using in tliis work, resulting, i t is believed, in diminislled labor of observilig the half-second pondulu~ns as well as increased accuracy. These changes, solno of mhicli are applications for tlle first timeto sliort 1)eudulumsof lnethods which have been already used with long pendulums arid less portable apparatus, ]nay be summarized as follows: First, use of low air pressures (GOmm); second, long swings (eight hours) ; third, consecutive swings coveriug entire interval between timo observations and a t least forty-eight llours; fourth, use of two chronometers; fifth, sn~all initial arcs of oscillation (65') j sixth, observing coincidences by contacts of images; seventh, rneasurenlent of flexure of stand and support a t all ~tations. The general plan adoptod * was to swing the pendulums continuously a t each lace for two

One smiug (eight hours in length) mas mnde with each of tho three pendulums ill each position, reversed and direct, making in all six swings a t s station, except in the cnso of unfavorable weather. With tlle improved portable air pump i t was found possible to cxliaust the air from tho receiver to loss than one-tenth of an atmosphere in a few miuutes. It was tllereforo decided to adopt a sta,nda,rd pressure of G O ~ l l ~ill ~ l which to swing the pendulums, and also to langthen the swings to eight hours, which could be dorm with ease a t this low pressure.

The diagram (fig.2) shows the decrement of arc of a half-second pendulum, both observed and computed on the law of diminution in geometrical ratio, a t two pressures, 509111m and 33mn1, and indicates that if desired, co~itinuous swings could be ruadc a t low pressures, of any length up to twenty-four hours. On accouht of its obvious advalitages a small initial arc of oscillation, about 56' total, was adopted, from which the arc diminishes in an eight-hour swing to about 201. A modification in the method of observing coincidences was liecessary for these small arcs, to explain which some description of the use of the coincidence apparatus must be given. In this apparatus a chronometer breaking an electric circuit every second is connected with an electro-magnet carrying on the end of its extended armature two shutters so arranged that a flash of light is thrown through a slit every time tho circuit is broken, and only then. (See illustration NO.20, Appendix 15, Iteport 1891.) This bright slit is seen in the observing telescope as reflected from two mirrors placed side by side, one stationary on the shelf in the receiver and the other carried by tho swinging pendulum. These ~nirrors are so :~djusted that when the penduluni is hauguig freely a t rest tho two images mill be seen in the same horizontal line in the telescope. The11the pendulum is swinging tlie image as reflected from the pendulum mirror will change its position as seen each second in the field of the telescope, because of the fact that the penduluni maltes a double oscillatiori in a little more than a second, and hence will be foulid lightly behinq its forper positioi~a t the end of each second wlien the flash is thrown. The moving image will thercfore appcar to travel up and dowri across the field of the tolcscope by successive? jumps, and coincidences are observed by noting the time when the two images are ill the same liorizontal line. It is evident that in the interval between two such plienomena tho pendulun~11asmade one less than twice as many oscillations as the chroriomcter has beat seconds, and that in an interval of time between the first and last of a nulnbcr of coincidences the number of oscillatior~s of the pendulum will be twice the number of seconds less the number of coincidence intervals. But when small arcs of oscillation are used, the rnotior~ of the moving image across tho field is slow, and the two images may overlap for a number of seconds. The modification introduced in observing is to note the contacts, or the time when these images touch aritl when tliey separate, and take the mean as tlie time of coincidence. By this means coincidences may be observed when tho total arc of oscillation is as small as st,witli an u~icertaiuty of iiot more than out or two seconds, which is far within the requirements for long swings. Only sufficient coincidences (usually three) were observed a t each end of the swing to make sure that the total number occurring iu the interval could be correctly estimated. The period was computed by combining the difference between the first aiid last "down" coincidences and the first and last "upv coincidences, thus eliminating all error due to imperfection of relative adjustment of the mirrors or possible change in this adjustment during the swing. Two chronometers mere used, coincidences boing noted alternately with each. This may be done very readily with this flash apparatus and a suitable arrangement for switching eitlier chronometer into circuit, and while increasing very little the labor of observing, affords an excellent check on the periods as well as a guard against accident to timepiece. I t is believed that by swinging tlie pendulums contiriuously between time observations the effect of diurn:~lirregnlarities of rate is entirely eliminated, as i t mill not be by any other method, slid this is strikingly shown by comparing the mean periods of the three peildulums as derived separately from the two chronometers (see Table G). The average difference a t the various stations is about -000 0001 second, and the maximum a t any station -000 0004 second, although the results for single swings often diff'er materially, in one case as much as .000 0027 second (in a four-hour swing on March 9, swing No. 17, Table G ) , c;orrespondiug to a reIative variation of daily rate of half a second. The use of a 50-ohm relay in the chronometer circuit rendered i t more constant, aiid protected the chronometer from the stronger currents necessary to work the flash apparatus. The two chronometers were compared on a chronogra1)h before and after time observations, (luring which, of course, only one mas used. They were kept uildcr as favorable conditions as possible regarding temperature, being in double leather cases, which were only opened once daily to wind. They were not moved during observations, as their breaks mere carried to the chronograph in the observatory and to the flash apparatus by wire, and a sidereal watch was used as a hack both in

REPORT FOR 1 8 9 P P A R T 1 1 . time observatione and in noting coincidences. The seconds of the watch were frequently compared with the chronometers by ear through the fact that the latter omit to break the circuit tat the sixtieth second. The average time required for a station, including traveling and all delays of every sort, was fiye and a half days. In the transcontinental series of stations remarkably favorable weather conditions were experienced, only two days being lost on account of inability to obtain star observations, out of a total of one hundred and five days and twenty stations. The usual program followed in the observations was: First day, station prepared and instruments set up, star observations for time between 9 and 10 p. m., pendulum A 4 (reversed) started a t 10 p. m.; second day, A 4 (direct) started at 6 a. m., A 6 (reversed) a t 2 p. m., time observations at 9 p. m., A 6 (direct) started a t 10 p. m. ; third day, A 6 (reversed) started a t 6 a. m., A 6 (direct) at 2 p. m., time observations a t 9 p. m., pendulum topped immediately afterwards; fourth day, instruments packed. Sf star observations were not obtained on the third night; the swings were continued, repeating the above order. Usually about forty-five minutes were required for each time determination, and the same for each set of pendulum observations, including the d n d coincidences of one swing, the changing of the pendulum and exhausting the receiver, and the f i s t coincidences of the next swing. The following is an example of the record of observations for a single swing:

Besides the above, latitude observations were made on one or two nights a t each place where neceeeary, the statiou was connected as to elevation with some known point, and the time and pen-. dulum computations were kept up from day Go day. A t two places, Colorado Springs and Terre! Haute, meridian lines were laid out by request. A t one station, Norris, Wyo., where only one! day could be spent, the regular program was necessarily shortened, and each pendulum mtw swung in one position only. For this reason, and on account of the unsatisfactory mounting of the receiver, fhis result is less reliable than the others. A t stations where the range of temperature was considerable, due to inability to secure a favorable location in this respect, thermometer wadil~gs were taken more frequently, and each was weighted according to the interval of time intervening. A t only four stations, however, did the total range of temperature in tho pendulum I receiver exceed 40 0. Rating o f chronometers.-At most of the stations transit observations of about eight stars were made by the writer each favorable evening to determine the daily rate of the chronometers. These were recorded chronographically, as also were the comparisons between the chronometers. The meridian telescope mas generally mointed on three wooden posts, set in the ground and well braced, though iu a few cases masonry piere yere built or found available. A t Princeton, Denver, and St. Louis the use of fixed observatory instruments was courteously granted, irnd at Cambridge, Charlottesville,and Oincinnati the time observations wore made by theobservatory authorities and the rates kindly furnished. At Denver the observations were made by Mr. Mendenhall. The precautions taken with the chronometers have already been mentioned. The following table (B) gives a summary of the rates on sidereal time. After each station are given the average h m perature and the elevation, as having an important influence on the rate. Ohronometer 1828 was not used after the first two stations on account of the remarkable change in its rate. A t Chmlottesville and Princeton, where time observations were ~lluch interrupted by unfavorable weather, the daily chronometer rates were derived by comparison with the staxldmd observatory olocke, the rate of the latter being assumed uniform between time observations. 8.

REPORT FOR 1 8 9 A P A S T 11. From these mean periods gravity a t the various stations mas computed from the relation PW2 gw, gravity a t Washington Coast and Geodetic Survey Office (y) being assumed to be go= 9SO.098 dynes, and the mean of the periods a t Washington beforo and after each series being taken for Pw. Although an elaborate measurement of the absolute force of gravity mas made a t Waehington in October, 1893, by Commandant Defforges,* i t is thought best to adhere for the present to the provisional value previously adopted for Washington (Smithsonian Institution), giving the above valuo a t Coast aud Geodetic Survey Office, so as to make these results directly comparable with those already published. Large discrepancies appear among the results of the best determinations of absoluto gravity made a,t tho base stations in Europe, as will be seen by examining the table of values reduced to Washington iu P a r t I V of this report. The mean of the twenty-nine results there given is not very different from the adopted provisional value. The results for g computed separately for each pendulum and station, with the mean and differences from the mean, are given in Table D.

matter lying above sea level, and n is mean density of the earth. The first term takes account
of the distance from the earth'a center, and the second term of tlie vertical attraction of the

matter lying between the sea level and station, on the supposition that the latter is located on an indefinitely extended horizontal plain. Wherever the topography about a station departs tnaterially from this condition of a horizontal plain a third term must be added to tlie above formula, b a n g a correction to the second term or to observed gravity on accoulit of such irregularities." This, which may be called the topographical correction, will always be positive, as the effect of all deviations from the horizontal plain, whether hills or mountains risixig above the station, or valleys or canyons lying below it, will be to diminish the force of gravity. It is evident that an elevation of any sort exactly neutralizes the vertical attraction of a similar but inverted mass below the station level, so that the removal of both would not change the force of gravity a t the station. This correction may be readily computed for any point where contour maps of the surrounding country are.available, by describing thereon concentric circles about the station and drawing radial lines therefrom a t equal angular distances, as show~l in figure 3 (or this design may be drawn on a sheet of tracing paper to be laid over the map).

The space included between two circles may be designated a.s a zone, and the part of a zone between two radii as a compartment. The vertical attraction of a cylinder of radius a, height h, and density S on a point a t one extremity of its axis will be 2 ~ (a 6 + h - .\/-I. As a ; zone is the difference between two cylinders, say of radii a and at, its vertical attraction will be 2x6 (a - a' - .\/aZ+ kz d v I E 2 ) .

As this will vary for differant portions of a zone, the parts of the formula irlvolving h must be computed separately for each compartment therein, and the mean applied iu the formula for the zone. When these zones have been carried to such a, distance from a station that their effect begins to become insignificant, the vertical attraction of the remaining region may be readily computed by the formula dg = lc ( *1Z2+-h2 a), where a is the outer radius of the last zone, this being the formula for the difference between an infinite plain of thickness 1~ and a cylinder of height 1~ and radius a.. The : m a immediately about the station within the first circle may often be neglected as ;bpproximately level, or otherwise the effect of its irregularity rnay be computed by taking the difference between a cylinder and a cone, the formula becoming a2 where a is the radius and h the difference of elevation a t distance n from

the station, taken for each compartlnent separately, keeping in mind always that we are computing only the correction t o the vertical attraction of a n infinite horizontal plain through the station, and thereforo only need take account of deviations therefrom. The total correction for a station mill of course bo the surn of tho corrections for the separate zones. Where tho station is a t the summit of a small hill rising out of a comparatively level country, i t will generally suffice to troat the hill as a cone without dividing the country into compartments; the formula for this case is h2 dg = 76 --- which represents the difference between the vertical attraction of an infinite plain daZ+ ha' of thickness h aud a cone of height h and radius a. The egect of topographical irregularities has been investigated in the manner described for all tho stations of tho past season, using wherever available tho contour maps of the Geological Survey. Although applied in all cases where appreciable, a t only one station, Pikes Poak, was this correction found to be of rea,l importance. This is partly due to tlie favorable location of the stations, but also to the fact that except on the summit of rugged mountains or very close to tlieir base, or in deep, narrow valleys, this correction must necelssarily be small. The effect of placing an infiuite horizontal plain 114 feet (35metres) in tliickness, or a sphere 338 feet (103 metres) in tliaineter, and of deusity equal to one-half tlie mean density of the earth, immediately above a stiltion mould be to diminish gravity by only 404 dy~le, or about the d o T 0 t h pa.rt, wllich niay a t present be taken as the utmost limit of probable accuracy of observation. These considerations iridicats that for a majority of stations in ope11 country a rough estimate will show that tho topographical correction is inappreciable. The question of the proper reduction of pendulum observations to the level of the sea, involving as i t does the various theories of the condition of the earth's crust, and affecting very materially the use of such observations in deducing the figure of the earth, is a most important one, and has led to the exl,ression of many different opinions. Bouguer's reduction, above described, hue been very generally adopted. Professor Eelmert, in the masterly discussion of pendulum observatiot~sin his Hiihere CeodHsie, develops and uses the condensation method, assuluing a surface 21 ltiloiiletres below the sea level, to which all the overlying material is condensed. As approsimately applied by him in the discussion of coutine~ltal stutio~is this rcductiol~ amounts t o omittlng t l ~ o correction for attraction (second term) ill Uouguer's formula, but not so in coast and oceallic isl:~nd stations, where the effect of the lesser density of sea water is taken into account.

24

UNITED STATE8 COAST AND GEODETIC SUBVEY.

M. Faye, 'in papers published in Comptea Rendus in 1880 and 1883, advocates that the continental attraction term in Bouguer's formula be omitted, but that all local deviations of the elevation of the station from the general level of the land surface or sea bottom be allowed for, as, for instance, the attraction of a mountain on a station a t its summit, or of an isolated island. This subject has also been discussed by Stokes, Peirce, Ferrel, and many others. In the recent reports on pendulum observations in the Proceedings of the International Geodetic Association, tho reductions have been made by two methods: First, with Bouguer'e formula, and second, using the reduction for elevation, omitting the attraction term; and the same plan is followed in tho summary of results given in Table E. The surface densities here given have been kindly furnished by Mr. G. K. Gilbert, of tho United States Geological Survey, who visited personally many of the stations and made careful estimates for all.* They represent tlie average for tho mass above sea level at each station. The value 5-58 has been used for tho mean density of the earth. So a s to be able to study the results moro intelligently, tho values a t sea level have been co~npared with those computed by an assumed theoretical forrnultl g = 078.066 (1+ ,006 243 sin"), which is based on Clairant7stheorem, Olarke's figure of the earth, and the assumption that gravity is normal on the eastern coast of the United States. Finally, this table gives the differences observed, minus computed gravity, for both methods of reduction t o sea level. Thess differences are shown graphically in the diagrams in connection with the map (fig. 4), whore also aro included two stations, San Francisco and Mount Hamilton, previously determined. While i t is somewhat unsafe to draw general conclusions from a single series of observations, yet the favorable and systematic situation of these stations with respect to an unusual variety of continental conditions perhaps warrants the pointing out of a few possibleinferences. With Bougaer's reduction there is apparently a considerable defect of gravity under the western mountains and plateaus having a striking relation in amount to the average continental clevations. This can not bo accounted'for to any great exterit by a supposed abuormal condition in the mass above sea level, as it would require that that mass should have a density of zero to offset this defect; the presumption is, therefore, that there is a deficiency of density below sea level which in general compensates the elevated masses. Oontrary to a recent assertion, the residuals do not appear to have .-- -* Mt. Gilbert also furnished the following ellumeration of the more important underlying rocks, stated ln the

any relation to distance from the sea, or to the elevation of the particular point of observation, as is shown by the fairly horizontal lines under that part of tho central plain (Cincinnati to Ellsworth) where the altitude is nearly the same, and the nearly equal deficiencies found a t stations which, like Guriuisou, Pikes Peak, Colorado Spriiigs, and Denver, vary enormously in elevation. With the reduction fbr elevation only the apparerit defect of gravity largely disappears, as sl~own by tho nearly horizontal line of residuals undor the great central plains, where the altitude varies from 151 to 1841 metros (495to 6041 feet), and by the average result in the mountain rogioiis. I11 tlle latter, however, the line shows considerable departures from the normal, both positive arid negative, the residuals showing a striking relation to the elevations of the stations as compared with the elevations of the surrounding country. Pikes Peak, Pleasant Valley, Mount Hamilton, and the Yellowstoue statiou are above the average level and show an excess of gravity, while the remaining Rocky Mountain stations are below the general levol and all show a defect of gravity. This condition is especially marked in the c:tse of Green River and Grand Junction, in the bottom of great eroded valleys, aud Pikes Peak station, on the summit of an isolated mountain. The residuals are not proportional to the elevation of tho station itself abovo sea level, as is a t once seen by comparing Mount Hamilton, Salt Lako, Grecn River, Grand Junction, and Denver, which are of nearly equal elevation. Finally, with oitller systoln of reduction tho residuals point to the probability tha8 gravity is large on the seacoast as compared with the interior. Whether this can have ally connectioli with the effects of erosion and deposition of continental mattor is a question upon which the observations in this series are far too limited to throw any clear light, but for investigating which certain portio~ls of the United States would furnish an excellent field. The results of this series mould therefore seem to lead to the conclusion that goneral continental elevations are colnpensatod by a deficiency of density in the matter below sea level, possibly in much the same way that the portion of an iceberg standing above sea lovol is compeilseted by the differeilce in density of ice and water belolv the surface, but that local topographical irrogularities, whether elevations or depressions, are not cornponsated for, such irregularities being mair~tainccl by the partial rigidity of the earth's crust. Tlie residuals with Bouguer's reduction should then be interpretad as a measure of tlie deficiency of density, and, on tho other hand, the residuals with the reduction for elevation should be takon as a measure of the lack of compensation, after allowing for uncertainties of observation and the effects of local geological conditions. Developing the idea of M. Faye, observed values of g may be corrected for this lack of compensation by adding or subtracting the vertical attraction of a horizontal plain whose thickness is the difference in elevation between the station and the This correction may be expressod drJ = 2 g - which reprer 4 n senta the attraction of an indefinitely extended horizontal plain of thickness 1, and density 8, and the correction is positive for stations below the average level and negative for tliose above. This method has been tested by applying i t to the stations most affected in the present series, the average elevation beirig approximately estimated from a contour map for tlie country within an arbitrarily adopted radius of 100 miles of each station. The resulting corrections aro shown in the following table, together with the residuals, g observed minus g computed (under the head of Faye's roductionn), when this compensation correction was applied, together with the elevation and topographical corrections.

indicating apparently a considerable advantage for the latter. It is probable that no particular significance attaches to tliese residuals remaining after the application of Faye's reduction, for several reasons; other values would certainly result if 8 different area were considered in estimating the average surroundirig elevation, or if weight were given according to proximity to the station in making this estimation; and the average elevatio~ishere given are subject to some uncertainty, as they were obtained from a smit11 8c::llu III:L~).

An inspection of the table shows that the residuals with Bougnor's reduction are very nearly proportional t o the average surrounding elevations, though bearing no relation to the actual etation elevations. The true reduction of gravity observations to sea level mould appear to be one that would take account not only of the attraction of matter above the sea level but also of the general differences of density below, as well as of the local lack of co~npensation if the latter can be proved to have a systornatic relation to the topographical situation of the point of observation, as is strongly indicated by these results. With such a method i t is quite possible that the so-called anomalies of gravity will largely disappear and that the distribution of gravity on the earth's surface will be found to follow Clairaut's law sufficiently closely to greatly enhance the value of pendulum observations in relation to the problem of the earth's figure. As furnishing further evidence on this subject, there is collected in Table P :t Rummary of the various other Coast and Geodetic Survey series of gravity measurements baaed on WashingMr. Preston, and Mr. Smith. A s these include a number of ton, and made by Dr. Meiidenl~all, oceanic island and coast stations, it was riecessary in applying Faye's idea of reduction to take between sea water and land. This was done by assuming the account of the difference in deri~ity water as condensed down until i t s density equaled that of land, and using the ul)per surface of this condensed mass in e~timating the average elevation of the surrounding region. I n application, the depth of sea water a t any point, multiplied by (1

- $1,where 6, is density of sea water

and 6 is density of land beneath the station, gives the depression below sea level of the assumed surface. By tekirig these depressions as negative elevations, the average surrounding elevatioll may be conveniently estimated for all stations, whether on large or small islands or continental coasts, the principal difficulty being tbe lack of sufficient data as to ocean depths, and of contour maps, and the uncertair~ty as to how large an area should be considered for each station. A similar treatment could bc applied to continental stations where tho regions surrounding varied the average olevations considerably in density. I11 Table F are given the elevations of the statio~ls, within a radius of 100 miles, considering the mater as condensed (estimated in nearly all cases from very imperfect data), the observed valueu of g r a ~ i t ~and y , the residuals, observed g minus computed g for both Bouguer's and Faye's reduction to sea level. These reductions were applied

in the mine manner. as before; tllo same theoretical forn~uln was used for co~nputcd !I, and average values were talten for tho density of land (3.56) anti of' sea \r;lter (1.03).

Mean deneity of the earth from Pikes Peak pendulum observatw?~.-A value for the mean density of the earth has been deduced from the gravity measurements made on the summit of the Peak arid at Colorado Springs, near the base. This method of comparing the known mass of a mountain with the uuknown mass of the earth has been used on a t least four previous occasions, but not, it is believed, uuder as favorable conditions as the present, for in this case contour maps of the Pealr and surrounding country were available, and the monntrtin itself was found to be composed of rock of an unusually uniform de~iuit~y. Mr. Whitman Cross, of the United States Geological Survey, who haa studied the geology of the vicinity, kindly furnished data in regard

30

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

to the specific gravity of the rock of which the Peak is composed. Twelvo specimens collected from various parts and determined under Nr. Gilbert's direction gave values as follows: 3-57,2.60, 2.61, 2.61, 2.62, 2.67, 2.67, 2.58, 2.61, 2.61, 2.63, 2.71. The mean, 2.615, has been'adopted. The difference in gravity a t the base and summit of a mountain will be, by Bouguer's formula,

considering the upper station as on an infinite horizontal plain, tho lower station as unaffected by the attraction of the mountain, and neglecting the insignificant effect of change in centrifugal force. Here H i s the difference in elevation of the two stations (2452 meters), r is the radius of the earth, 6 is the density of the mourltain (2.615)' and A is the mean density of the earth. The correction to observed gravity for local topographical irregularities (or departure from the condition of a horizontal plain) was carefully computed for these two stations as described in discussing the g * 439, and for Colorado Springs reduction to the sea level, and found to be for Pikes Peak + -3 2rA 38 8 27 (using the metre as unit of length). he' observed values of gravity mere for Pikes 2r n Peak 978.940, and for Colorado Springs 979.476, to which must be applied tho above correctious for topographical irregularities to obtain dg for the above formula, which then becomes:

+-

which reduces to 636 = 2-g
T

or A = 2.153 6 = G63.

The value for the mean density of the earth derived from the Pikcs Peak observations is therefore 5.63. I n this computation no account has been taken of the estimated difference in density below t h e level of Colorado Springs.

. . . -- -- -- -*Tho effect of earth vil>rationson pendulnm observations has reco~ltlyreceived some attention. See paper by C. E. Scliiijta, publishsd by Dio r~orw~egitrche Grndmess~lng Commiesion, I<ristiana, 1894. Our ow11 experience would indicate that such effects arc uegligible, aeno systematic t11Kerrnceshave bcen detected between observations made during day and night, or on different days. t See papor "On the use of planes and knife-edges in pondulums for gravity moasuromeuts," by Dr. T. C . Moudenhall, Alnericnn Journal of Soionco, Vol. XLV, page 144.

The value 970.651 was obtai~iecl for Mount Hamilton by Mr. Preston with half-second pendoIrums I 3 1, B 2, aud B 3, irl 1592. Tlie half-second pendulr~rnstations of 1894 were nearly idontical with those of Commandant DelYorges in 1893. A t Wasllrl~gto~~ tlie same pier was used; a t Chicago the same pier, though b u ~ l about t 1metre higher t11:ln in 1893; a t Salt Lalte the same higli stone pier, though a capstone found loose was removed in 1894 ; a t I)e~iver the samc concrete floor, but the lialf-second pendulurn case mas set nearer the outer Souudation m:~ll,where this floor is more solid. Experi?)rents w i t h knife-ecbes of V ~ L ~ Z Ozuidths US and a?zgles.t-A number o f experiments in regard to knife-edges were made by Dr. Mendenhall in 1893. A11 oxperi~nentalpeliclulum mas used, having a steel plane set in its head, ant1 this was swung upon s steel knife-edge which mas set in a so arranged tlint it could be taken from the receiver and reground at will. A l t ~ r heavy metal blo~li, nate swings were nlade with tlie same pendrilutn npon an agate knife-edge wliose coliclition was not changed duriug tile operat~ons, and from those correctio~lsfor variations in the ratos of tho two chronometers used were de(1ucctl and applied. Experiments mere first made with diff'ereut widths of the steel knife-edge, it being originally ground to n fiharp edge by Mr. Pischor, and then from time to time sliglitly flattened by rubbing on a Ane stone. The successive widths of edge

As a result of this experimerit tlie :u~glo Va~iatiolr of period at clifferent a ~ c s . - A preliiiiiuary iuvestigatiou of this subject was made by swinging two l~cndnlums simllltaneously on indepenilent piers, using the saiile chronometers. Olio peudulum used as a standard was restartad encli liour and a half, tlie suc:cessivo swings being to swing contiunously for made under exactly the same conditions, while tho otlier mas ~llowed ten hours, tho arc gradually dimirtisliir~gmeanwhile, observatior)~ beilrg made ewh hour and a half. Thus tlm period of the latter (A 4) w;ls obtained a t v;u.ious arcs, free from errors of rate. This gendulum swi~igs upon an agato knife-odgo which had llad coiiil)nrativoly little use. Tlle results as give11 below seem to indicate tli:~tthe period mill differ ~0111ew11at a t different arcs, eveu after the arc correction has been applied, undoubtedly duo to thc fact that different portions of the knife-etlge aro brought, into use. This is an experiniental proof of what has already been supposed to bo tlie case, and justifies the precautions usni~lly taken to use u~~iform limits of arc in a series of observations.

Mention of this work and its objects has alreacly been made (lteport 1891, Part 1 1 , p. 56.3): A room havirlg been Atted up for pendulurn worlc in the basernont of the Coast and Geodetic Survey a t tho Smithsoniari InstiOffice, ib was desired to compare this station wit11 the former base statioi~ tation, so that relative gravity observ:lt,iol~s referred to either poiiit as a base could be reduced to a comm6nsystem. For t,his ~ ) u r ~ ) othe s e telegraphic method was c?mployed, which consists in the siruultal~eousswingiug of two pentlulums a t stations connected by wire, so that the same timepiece ]nay be used a t both, thus f'reei~~g the observations from tlie rate of the chronometer, and are thexi interchanged between avoidil~gtho necessity for tirne observatiolis.

The thermometers ancl 1)nrometers liatl their errors carefully deter~nined. The diagram (fig. 7) shows the general arrangement of circuits. Througli the courtesy of to key and sounder Mr. Marean, a Western Union mire was used between the stations. In :idditio~l for communicatioll there were two locel circuits at each station, olle c o ~ l t x i ~ ~ i flash n g apparatus,

The above mean temperature coefficients (represeuting increase of period for 10 C. increase of temperature) were used for the two pendulums, respectively. Table H gives a summary of the redwed periods, a l ~ d the differences A-B, for each chronometer and swing. In these tables of diKorences i t will be noted that large values wit11 onc chronometer are in general accompanied by srnall values wit11 tlie other, probably indicating the efi'ect of variations in tlie line, as the clironometers were :it the two ends. The last column in this table shows the precision with which successive comparisons of tlie periods of two pendulums can be m:de under uuclianged conditions, the greatost discrepancy fiom tho mean of :my group being about one-millionth part of the period. l2esults.-Below are collected the mean periods for each relation of the pendulums, averaging also the results by the two chronometers:

V.. -ANOMALIES IN THX FOROE OF GRAVITY ON THE OONTINENT OF NORTH AXEEIOA, BY OOMMANDANT DEFFORGES.

The studies of the force of gravity undertaken by the Service Wographique of the army have perluitted the formulation of some interesting empirical laws, which were submitted on July 15,1803, to the judgment of the Academy by the minister of war. It is &own by the recent measures, and by a certain number of older determinations which can be combined with certainty with the contemporary observations, that the shore of the same sea appears to possess a characteristic force of gravity, the variation of which dong that &ore follows suficiently exactly the law of the sine squared of the latitude announced by Olairant. But, on the one hand, the islands which arise from the great depths of the sea present a considerable excess of gravity, as has been inferred since the first discussions of observations with the pendulum made during the old voyages of circumnavigation; and, on the other hand, upon the continents of Europe, Africa, and Asia there is proved a defect of gravity which seems in the distribution of the masses of the terrestrial crust to counterbalance the excess of the islands of the ocean. It was of interest to extend and confirm this last law, and to ascertain if the American continent actually presented, like the other continents, this negative anomaly of gravity, and to wha* degree. Taking advantage of a voyage of duty to the United S b h s , I have been able, with the aid of funds generously placed at my disposition by the Academy, to execute with the ' L reversible inversablen pendulum relative observations of the force of gravity a t seven stations on the continent of North America. Furthermore, upon a courteous request addressed by Dr. T. 0. Mendenhall, Superintendent of the army, I of the Ooast and Geodetic Survoy, to the director of the L L Service G6ographique9? have measured the absolute force of gravity a t Washington with the pendulums of Bmnner. The relative stations have been chosen in euch a manner as to bring out MImuch as possible the continental anomalies. Two of the stations, Sau Francisco and Washington, are situated near the shores of tho oceans, and within a few degrees upon tho same parallel. A central station, a t Salt Lake City, not distant from the Great Salt Lake, occupies a point in the lowest part of tho great plateau between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. Another station a t the observatory recently founded at Denver, on the other side of the Rocky Mountrtins, at more than 1,600 metres elevation, is situated upon the vast plateau which serves as a pedestal t o the Rocky Mountains and descends by insensible degrees to the valley of the Mississippi. These two stations, Salt Lake Oity and Denver, are sufficientlydistant fronl tho most elevated mountain masses to escape the topographic attraction, and their situation upon the solid mass itself of the backbone of the American continent render them well suited to reveal the continental defect of gravity with its greatest value..

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The other stations, Mount Hamilton, Chicago, and Montreal, situated on both'sides of the stations of the great plateau, serve for transition to the stations on the borders of the oceans, and permit the following of the variation of the anomaly, roferred to gravity observed a t Paris, until beyond its change of sign, which takes place at some distance from the ocean shore, following the law already established in Europe and Algeria. The absolute force of gravity, memured a t Washington in the pendulum room of the Coast snd Geodetic Survey Office, is g = 9.80 165 metres The relative measure gave, between Paris and Washington, g = 9.80 169 metres The accord of the two valuoe is entirely satisfactory. I have adoptsd for Washington the mean g = 9.80 167 metres The table which follows includes the values of g measured, relatively to Paris, a t the seve; American stations, and for each of these: First, the reduction to the level of the sea, following the formula of Bouguer; second, the theoretic gravity, calculated according to the law of Clairant and with the flathning of Clarke, considering as normal the force of gravity a t Paris j and finally, third, the anomaly of the observed gravity.

The curve (here omitted) gives a very clear idea of the general change of the anomaly of gravity on the American continent.* Although the deviations of the vertical have not yet been determined a t the American Stations, the largest values which experience has given for this deviation on the globe mould not affect the anomalies to a sensible amount. These results entirely confirm the facts of observation anuounced in the note of July 15 last. If is interesting to no& that the continental anomaly upon the high American plateau is very nearly equal and of opposite sign to the anomalies of the islands in the great depths of the Pacific and Atlantic.

A REPORT ON A GEOLOGIO EXAMINATION O F SOME COAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY GRAVITY STATIONS.

By G. K. GILBERT, Geologist United Statea Geologioel Survey.

DEPARTMENT O F THE INTERIOR, UNITED STATESGEOLOGICAL SURVEY, Washington, D. C., Marclb 19, 18.95. DEAR SIR: In accordance with an informal arrangement mado a year ago between this office and the Superinteudent of the C o a ~ Survey, t Mr. G. R.Gilbert was illstru~ted to make some special geological examinations in conjunction wit11 the work of Mr. Puttiam in the messure~nentof gravity. As this work on behalf of the Geological Survey was merely accessory to that of the Ooaat Survey, i t seelns proper that its results should be published by the Coast Survey ill co~ijunction with the report by its own ofEcer. I therefore transmit to you herewith Mr. Gilbert's report, which is in the form of a lettor addressed to yourself. Yours, with respect, OHAS.D. W A L O O ~Director. T, Gen. W. W. DUFFIELD, Superintendent United Statea Ooast and Geodetio Sur?)ey.

DEPARTBXENT O F THE INTERIOR, UNI~ED STATESGEOLOGICAL SURVEY, Washington, D. O.,Narck 19, 1895. SIR : About a year ago Dr. T. 0. Mendenhall, then Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, invited me to make suggestion8 as to the selection of points for gravity stations. He was pt that time plauning a transcontinental chain of stations, approximately in latitude 390, and he desired to have the'points of observation so chosen aa to give light not only on geodetic problems but also on problems of peculiar interest to geologists. I n one of the conferences on this subject i t was suggested that special geologic examination of stations occupied was desirable, and as I was to be engaged in field work in Colorado while the gravity determinations were made, it was informally arranged that the precise points occupied by the observer should be communicated to me in Oolorado, and I should visit as many stations as practicable on my way back to Washington in the autumn. This arrangement was afterwards carried out, permission therefor being granted by the Director of the Geological Survey, and all Ilecessary information as to places, etc., being forwarded to me by Mr. G. R. l'utnam, the Assistant in charge of the work. T l ~ e stations visited by me were Colorado Springs, Denver, Wallace, Ellsworth, Kansas Oity, St. Louis, Terre Haute, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. As the mean density of the earth is greater than the density of the visible crust, there must be a general increase of density downward. So far as zones of equal density are spheroidal shells parallel to the superficial spheroid of reference, the distribution of densities may be regarded as regular or normal. To whatever extent the different parts of a spheroidal shell vary in density

the distribution is irregular. The geodesist and the geologist alike are interested in the determination of tile nature and extent of such irregularities. With the outermost portion of the lithosphere the geologist 11as some acquaintauce, and lie knows that it is not of uniform density. He suspects that the zone of heterogeneity extends farther, characterizing all that indefinitely limited portion of the lithosphere which he calls crust, and lie hopes that with the n~ultiplication of pendulum stations much may be learned of the extent and distribution of crustal inequalities. If the heterogeneity indicated by the pendulum is confined to the zone which is subject to direct observation or clear inference by the geologist, or if i t resides chiefly ill that zone, then tlie application of a correction properly based on geologic observations should render the measurements of local gravity more harmonious, If the application of such a correction fails to diminish the discrepancies of gravity determinations, the chief cause of local variation would seem to lie farther beneath the surface, or a t least to range farther from the surfi~ce. A t each station visited 1 examined the for~nations visible a t the .surface, collected samples to be used afterwards for tlio determination of specific gravities, and compiled such data as mere available from wells and the labors of other geologists as to the character of underlying formations. The densities, or specific gravities, of the specimens collected were determined by Mr. George W. Stose, Assistant Geologist, United States Geological Survey. For this purpose blocks of the size known as hand specimens were employed wherever practicable, and care mas taken to obtain the specific gravity of the rock as saturated with water, except in the case of specimens representing formations which lay above water line. Determinations were also made of a considerable number of other specimens in order to obtain average values for the densities of such rocks as were reported in well records, but were not available for specific determination. A great region, including the stations visited, is characterized by sedimentary rocks lying in nearly horizontal beds. These are of such vertical extent that a t none of the stations have they been completely traversed by the drill; but it is legitimately inferred from a study of tbe relations of these rocks as exhibited elsewhere that they have a total thickness rauging from one-half mile to 3 miles, and that beneath them are crystalline rocks which are not similarly arranged in horizontal strata. but are disposed jn beds of less regular .shape whose boundaries are often highly inclined or vertical. The particular disposition and arrangement of these crystalline rocks in tho viciuity of any of the stations can not be inferred from data now in the possession of the geologist, so that they must be classed for the purposes of tliis discussion with the subcrust of unknown density. Nevertheless, as the sedi~uentarycolumns are of unequal height, their attraction can not be compared to advantage without making some assumption as to the density of the crystallines on whose uneven surface they stand. The particular assumption on mhich the computations and accompanyi~~g tables are baaed is that the average density of the crystallines is 2.70. An average density of 2-65 was also assumed, and the computations repeated, but the results were so nearly identical that they are omitted to avoid prolix repetition. The standard density, 2.70, was subtracted from the densities of the various sedimentary rocks detenilined, reported, or inferred to occur beneath each of the gravity stations, aud the differepces were employed in the subsequent computations. In Table I the stations are listed in the order of their longitudes from east to west. Tho thickness of the sedimentary rocks was in each cam partly determined by local well records and Partly of estimated by the aid of well records or surfme measurements a t other points. I n the Ellsworth and Wallace the wells are shallow, and the bases of inference were so slender that the estimates of thickness have small value. I n the computation of mean densities tho measured densities of individual formations were used so far as possible, and in the absence of direct measurernents limestones were estimated a t 2.70, shales a t 2.43, and sandstones a t 2-40. The densities ascribed to the rocks a t Wallace and Ellsworth are interpolations. The corrections to the local detcrrninatious of gravity (column 6 ) were computed by means of the fbrmula

where H represents the thickness of the sedimentary rocks, d tbeir mean density, A the earth's lneali density, and r the earth's radius. The quantities in column 7 are residuals derived from tliose in column 6 by subtracting the mean of the q~isntities in column G from the several quantities.

In consideri~igtho eEect of applying such geologic correctio~isas nppoar i11 column 6 of Tablo I to local observatiou of gravity two quite distiuct and opposing points of view should be kept in 11lind: (a) High rigidity.-Tho earth's crust may be regarded as rigid, or a t least stiff enough to support the continents by its stiffnoss. Ln this case no necessary relation esists between altitude and density of crust. On this theory every measurement of gravity on land should be con-ected by subtracting fkom it the attraction duo to the inatter lying between tho statiou and the surface of tho spheroid of reference. (6) Isostasy.-The earth's crust may be regardod as relatively weak aud plastic. I n this case the continental masses and ocoan betis are in qoasi-hydrostatic equilibrium, and altitude is inversely related to the density of tho crust beuesth. On this hypothesis the correction should not be applic?d. The method employed in discussing tlie eEect of the geologic corroctions mas (1) to make the determiuations as homogenoous as possible by applying ell corroctions excopt the geologic one, and then lloto the outstanding discordauoe as shown by the rosiduals, or differences betmeo~~ individual measures arid the mean of all the measures ; (2) to repeat the process, including the geologic corrections, and thus derivo a second series of residuals; und (3) compare tho two series of rosiduals. I n Table 1 1 , postulati~igthe theory of high rigidity, c o l u ~ n ~ 8i givos tho observed values of gravity after corroctiori for latitude, altitude, local topography, and the attractiou of matter above sea level. Tho adjust~ne~it for latitude consisted in reducing each value to its equiv:ilent a t latitude 400. The corrections for altitude atid for the dofect of attraction escribablo to the local topographic relief mere tlioso tabult~tedby Mr. Putuam. Tho correction for tho attractioxi of matter abovo sea lovol assumed tho density of that matter to be 2-70. It should be noted in this connection that the (positive) correction for dtitudo and the (negative) correction for the attraction of matter above sea level are both too s~nallunder the theory of high rigidity; for these corrections, as computed, are proportional to tho height of the stations abovo the gooid, whereas they should be proportional to the height of the stations above the spheroid of roforence; and the theory of co~itinents uphold by terrestrial rigidity irnplies that the geoid in continental aroas lies above tho spheroid of reference. It is probnblo that if due account were taken of this factor the divergence of tlio valuos in column 8 would bo so~uewhat reduced. The values of gravity in column 9 more obtained by adding to tlio values in coluniu 8 tho geologic corrections of column 6 (Table I). The discordauoes of tho values in co1ui1111s S and 9 are exhibited by the residuals in columns 10 and 11.

It appears from the footings of the table that the gravity determinations a t the ten stations, if compared under sthe hypothesis of rigidity (but without allowance for the deformation of the geoid), exhibit a diversity or discordance measnred by the mean of residuals, 0.064 dynes; and that the application of the geologic correction reduces the discordance to 0.054 dynes. If these memures of discordance be further compared with the measure of the diversity of the geologic corrections, 0.010 dynes (column 7, Table I),it appears that the geologic corrections have the maximum possible effect in the direction of harmony, for it is only through their own diversity that they affect the diversity of the quantities to which they are applied. If any general conclusion may be drawn from these data, it would Reem to be that correctio~ls for the densities of the local formations may advantageously be applied to gravity determination0 discussed under the hypothesis of terrestrial rigidity. Table 1 1 1is bmed on computations in which isostasy is postulated. The values of gravity in column 12 were corrected. as before for latitude, altitude, and local topography, but not for the attraction of matter between the surface and sea level. I n this case the correction for altitude needs little qualification for the deformation of the geoid. The values of gravity after the application of the geologic correction appear in column 13. The quantities in columns 14 and 16 are residuals from columns 12 and 13, respectively.

f i o m the footings of this table i t appears that the gravity detarminations a t the ten statiollo, if compared under the hypothesis of isostasy, exhibit a discordance measured by 0.009 dynes, and that the application of the geologic correction does not reduce the discordance. No evident advtantage, therefore, results from applying a correction for the local density of the rocks accessible for examination when the observations are treated under the hypothesis that the altitude of the surface is a functio~~ of the density of the underlying crust.

TELEGRAPH10 DETERMINATION O F T E E FOROE O F GRAVITY A T BALTIMORE, MD., FROM SIMULTANEOUS PENDULUM OBSERVATIONS AT WASHINGTON AND BALTIMORE.
By E. D. PRRBTON, Assistnnt.
Submitted for publication February 15, 1895.

I n obedience to instructions of June 29,1893, a determination of the relative force of gravity between Washington, D. C., and Baltimore, Md., was undertaken. The exact points occupied were the Coast and Geodotic Survey Office in this city and the Johns Hopkins University a t Baltimore. Through tho kindness of President Gilman and Professor Romland the basement of the physical laboratory was placed a t our disposal. Tho height above mean tide is 100 feet (30.5 metres). A t Washington the pendulum was 45 feet (13.7 metres) above mean tide. The instruments used were the recently constructed half-second pendulums, and the method was that of swinging simultaneously two pendulums, the periods of both being determined by means of the same chronometer. The signals wero transmitted telegraphically. The distance from Washington to Baltimore is 40 miles. It is obvious that in the application of such a p l a ~ ii t is unnecessary to know the rate of the chronometer, and hence we may dispense with the star observations, a very laborious part of the usual scheme in the relative determinations of gravity. This method, tho first account of which appeared in the report of Dr. T. 0.Mendenhall on the transfer of our initial gravity station from the Smithsoninn Institution in this city to the Coast and Geodetic Survey Offlce, promises to be one of surprising accuracy. The work just referred to, executed by Mr. G. R. Putnam, Assistant, Coaut and Geodetic Survey, and Mr. Von der Trenck, Acting Aid, gave results in which the greatest discrepancy from the mean was only one part in two and rt half millions (Appendix No. 15, Report for 1891). The line, however, was short; but there is no rectson why the distance between the stations ehould enter a s a function of the accuracy, granting that the elmtrical oonnections, batteries, etc., remain the same from day to day. Por details regarding the execution of the present work reference may be made to Appendix No. 16, above cited. The eystem followed in the Washington-Bdtimore determinations was essentially the same and need not be retold. The use of two chronometers, one a t each station, eliminated from the result any error arising from the variation of the transmission tilno of the electric current during the experiment. The pendulums used were A,, A,, and A,, st one etation, and BI, BZ, and B, a t the other. 4 and B1 were swung simultaneously, as likewise were A, and B,, and finally 8, and B3. The B pendulums are of the old form, having the knife-edge on the pendulum and the plane on the support. The A pattern has the plane on the pendulum and the knife-edge on the support. After three days' work with B a t Washington and A a t Baltimore the pendulums and receivers were interchanged rtnd another set mas made with A at Washington and B a t Baltimore.

Finally, the pendulums mere simultaneously swung a t Washington, A* being compared with Bl, A, with B,, and & with B , . The pendulums were swung in the prime vertical a t both stations. Sidereal chronometer Negus No. 1823 mas used a t Washington and No. 1824 a t Baltimore throughout the work. From these threesets,, that is, from the swir~gsbefore and after the iuterchauge, and from direct comparison at the same place, it is possible to deduce a value for the difference of the force of gravity between Washington and Balti~noreand also two values for the difference of the times of oscillation of the pendulums. A complete and syrnrnetrical scheme would necessitate another direct compariso~~ a t the second stmation (Baltimore),which would furnish another value for the difference of gravity also. Letting n t, = the difi'erence.of the periods of 'two pendulums swinging a t the same place. n t, = the difference of the periods of the same pendulum when swinging a,t different places, and representing tho pendulums by capital letters and the places by expononts, as Au=the period of pendulum A a t Ba.ltiniore, Bw=the period of pcndulunl 13 a t Washington, froni the work before the interchange we have
AU-BW=nt,+ nt,

A W - B B = nt,- nt, (2) These equations will give n t, and at,. The period of A is greater than that of B a t the same place, and the period of the same peridulum is greater a t Baltimore than a t W a s l ~ i ~ ~ g t o n . From the direct comparison a t Wasllington nre get A w - B w = nt, Thi~ value serves as a check on the value of nt, derived from t.he interchange, and it 8180 gives us a criterion to judge of the consistency of the values of n t, from equations (1) and (2) by its substitution therein, but it throws no new light on the mean value of nt,, ailice i t must be substituted in equations which have already given this value. For each swing the pendulums were used in the direct and reverse positious, and both chronometers mere used, so that we have four values for each pair of pendulums. These inay be combined in different ways for the sake of comparing results obtained under like conditions ax regards chronometers, positiou, etc. Moreover, the mean values for each pendulum may be treated by deducing values of nt, from the separate consideration of the periods of the different pendulums in the same place and by deducing values of nt, from the same pendulums in different places. The mean results of n t, and at, from these separate treatments will of course be the same. Subtracting the differences An - B Wand AW - BVin the times of oscillation of the two pendulums a t the two*stations before and after the interchange, we have which terms represent two independent determinations of the relative force of gravity by the transportation of both pendulums from one station to the other. Adding the differences, we have (AB- BB)+ (A" - BW) (4) in which case the terms repreeent a comparison of the pendulums in two different places. I n both the above casm by taking the mean we of course arrive a t the same result which we would have obtained by solving equations (1) and (2). The second term of (4) was determined by direct experiment. We therefore have two values for tlie difference of period of the two pendulums, but s i ~ ~ c tho e difference of gravity must bo obtained from equation ( 1 ) and (2), where we have from (1)

It is true that from (1) and (2),by using the direct deterlninatiou of At,, me mny by substitution get values of nt, correspouding to the work before o ~ i d after t l ~ iriterchz~nge, e aucl these values will be different from that furnished by (1) and (2) in the ordinary solution; but the meal1 reverts the original value for the reason above stated. The observations a t Baltimore were made by Mr. F. A. Wolff, jr., those a t Washington being made by myself. Tlle apparatus mas set up and the electrical connections arranged a t both places by Mr. Wolff, who also made a complete reduction of the work. This has been checked by Mr. Put~iam and myself. The periods of oscillation were reduced to an infinitely small arc, to a temperature of 240 C. (a mean value), aud to a pressure of 500m111 a t 00 0. The constants employed mere slightly different from those previously used end given in Appendix No. 15. They were chauged by a subsequent discussion, but the temperature varied so little during the time of experiment arid the pressure mas maintained so near the standard dopeed that either set of constauts mould have answered for tho reductions. A corroction for "lag7'-that is, for the difference of temperature, betmeen that indicated by the thermometer and that actually existillg in the pendulum-has usually been applied to work of thie kind. I n the present case, liomever, this quantity is without any real influence, because it is insignificant when compared with errors of reading and graduation. Tho following tables givo the individual results for tlie different days in the two positions and for the two chronometers used. The numbers given are units in the seventh decimal place, and to each result tlie quantity 0.500N is to be prefixed. For example, the value of B, a t Washington on 1 1 8 ' , a d July 17 in the direct position slid by chronometer No. 1823 is understood to be 0.500 8 likewise for the otliere.

The difference in the time of oscillation of tho three pendulums is entirely without influence on the values of nt, in the three sets. I n passing from Washin-n to Baltimore the length of the period is increased by only one hundred thousandth part of itself, so that even if the pendulums differed in their times by 0-001"his would not influence the above results. A s a matter of fact, they differ by only one-tenth of this.

Assuming the value of g a t the Coast Survey Office to be 980.098 dynes, the value a t the Johns Hopkins University would be 980.083. The value of the difference of gravity between the two places is known with much greater accuracy than the absolute value a t Washington; indeed, the absolute value of gravity is not known anywhere to the degree of precision indicated abovo, and can not be so knowu with the appliances now a t our disposal and by using the present methods. It is assuming all that is warranted by work hitherto done to state the absolute value of g at Baltimore as 980.08 dynes. Since in general only one swing was made with each pair of pendulums before and after the interchange, a comparison of these results would hardly form a means of judging of the ability of the pendulums to repeat themselves under similar conditi'ons.

The greatest discrepancy from the mean, in the results by the ditterent pairs'of peiidulums, for tlie excess of tlie periotl a t Baltimore over that a t Washington, is less than one part in two niillion. I t is of course understood that tlie preceding treatment i~~lplies nearly equal periods ill the two l'endulums that are interchanged. It is assnmed that the change in A in passing from Baltimore to Wasliiugton is the same as that in B in passing from Washiligtoll to Baltimore. For exalnples, our first experilnerit gave A" - 1)' = + 1031.P x 10- 7 TVhe~i A is transported to Washingtou, we have for its period An - 6 8 , and when 13 is taken 6 1 3 . The difference given by direct observation was to 13altimore, its period becomes B'"

(rn+ BU = + 74.3

so that when we give + 37-2 as the effect of gravity, tlie supposition is that 6A = dB. 611 and BB liere represent the actual change iu tho period in consequence of a change of the force of gravity, expressed in units of the seventh decimal place of sidereal seconds. Assunling their and equality, tlie absolute difference between the pondululns a t the same place results from the follow10nt3: iilg equat' A" - B'" = + 1031.0 = At,, + At, C J A = + 37.2 A n - &A- 131" =.A\\' - B'\' = + 993.8 = A t, If the periods ofA and B are widely difierent, tho above method can not be employed, because the change in the time of oscillation of a pendulum depending on a change in the accelerating force is a function of the period. I n the case where tho value for A is twice as large as for B, that is, when a metre peudulum is employed a t one place and a quarter-metre one a t WG otlior, the value corresl~ondingto 2 At, i l l the solution of equations (1) and (2) would be composed of two parts, oiie of which would be twico as large as the other and would be LI t, from tlie A pendulum, the remairlder being At, from the B pendulum. There would, however., be no way of finding tho respective values of n t, from o simplo interchange of positions. Within tho limits of the United States, say from latitude 260 to latitude 490, the greatest change of period of a peiidulum would be about one thousandth part of itself (more exactly, 0.00; 03G). Hence, if quarter-metre pendulums are employed, the value of 6A would be 0.000 518". If the pendulums differed in their periods by one tllousa~idth of a second, the value of 8B mould be 0.000 519% I n this case the assumption that cfA and dB aro equal would involve an error of half a unit in the sixth place of decimals. This would make it necessary to have the difference between tlle periods of A and 13 not greabr than one five-hundredth part in order to have the sixth decimal place accurate in the result fqr nny determinatioii within the latitudes given. of one The efi'ect of a change of elevation on the force of gravity is such that the above li~nit thousandth of the period would not be reached ill any mountains in this country, tlie change in gravity being the same for 15 feet of elovatior1 as it is for one minute of latitude between 250 and 490, viz, 0.000 00144th part of itself. This does not take any account of the matter lying between the upper and lower station, but is purely the effect of the i~icreaseddistance from the earth7s center. We can therefore Bay that for all work in the United States it is sufficient and necessary that the quarter.metre pe~idulumsemployed in the telegraphic method of finding differences of the of a second in their periods. force of gravity should not ditter as much as one thousa~ldth S, EX.

The telegraphic determination of the difference of the force of gravity between two places by simultaneous oscillations gives rise to two methods of t r e a t m e n t t h a t of differences and ratios. The following is a statement of these methods, with an application of the data already given in the case of one set of pendulums, A, and B,. In considering the ratio of the times of oscillation of the pendulums we shall treat this quantity as A + B. The ratio of the places will be taken as the time of oscillation of the pendulum a t Baltimore divided by the time a t Washington. .

A similar statement can be made in regard to &. It may be mentioned, although the fact is evident from the interchange, that in order to bring out the factors composing K, we introduce precisely the quantities B" and AW, which are directly observed in the new position, and which determino the value of K?. If, in introducing the ident.ical factors in the two equivalent expressions for K,, they are chosen so that the ratios of tho pendulums in the two place8 are equal, the ratio of tho places must necessarily be equal, and vice versa in the case of K,.

These two ways of reducing the observatio~ls are each c;bpable of bringing out tho final values for the difference of the force of gravity in the two places, and also the difference of the times of oscillation of the two peudulums in the same place. There is still another way in which the observations may be combined. Although viewed from a different standpoint, it leads prccisely to tho same result. Inasmuch as the entire operation consists essentially of oscillating each of the two pendulums a t each place, wo may simply compare the times of the oscillations in the two places for the difference of gravity and tho tixnes of the two pendulums in tlie same place fbr the difference of the pendulnms. The values of the difference of gravity fbr the two pendulums will not be equal; neither will the values for the difference of the pexidulums in the different places be so, but toe mean value for gravity in the Arst case and the mean difference in the pendulums in the second will be identical with the values heretofore obtained by the ocher two methods. This is s h o w in the following scheme (see 1,. 61). As heretofore, mo are using uuits in the seventh place of decimals A" = 9131.8 AW = 9104.2

REPORT OF DECEMBER 27, 1893.

I have the lionor to present herewith the results of tlie difference of longitude between Tacoma, Wasli., and Sitka, Alaska, also. between Sitka and Yakutat, Alaska, from observations made in 1892 and computed a t the office by Mr. D. L. Hazard. For the purpose of determining the longit~ides of certain standard stations in Alaska, to begin with, two chroliomotric expeditions were fitted out in 1892, one to fix the longitude of tlio astronomic station at, Sitka, the chronometers being carried on board the Pacific Coast Steamship Company's steamer Queen, the other to fix the longitude of the astronomic station 011 Khantaalr Island, Yakntat Bay, the chronometers being carried 011 board the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Hassler. Betweeri June and September the Queen made six round trips b e t ~ ~ e eTacoma ii and Sitka,, and between May and September the Hassler made seven round trips between Sitka and Yaklitat. A t Tacoma transit observations for time were made by Assistant J. F. Pratt. He used meridian telescope No. 13 (aperture S&Cm) and observing (Sid.) chronometer Hutton No. 207. There mere also kept At the 'observatory and rated by comparisons the auxiliary lnean tiiue clironometers Frodsham No. 2490 and Hutton No. 231. A table of the resulting chronometer corrections and rates is given in Supplement A. July 18, chronomotcr Huttou No. 231 was transferred to the Queen.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC STJltVEY.

The method of reduction of tlie observations for longitude was as follows: The traveling or sea rates of the chronometers were deduceti from the comparisons a t the observing or first station, made just before starting and irninediately after the roturu thereto, for each trip, the accumulated rates while a t the second station having been deducted. Thus, each chronometer for each round trip furnishes a result for 1ongit.ude. Similarly, as furnishing another combination, the starting and returning is made fro111 the secontl station, but in this case instead of n, all-round trips, there will be oi~ly n - 1. The advantage of making these two co~nbinations lies i11 this, that the presence of any consistent accelerated (or retarded) rate would be indicated by the results, and i t serves to some extent as a check to the computations. To t h e n - 1results that deduced from the first outer and the last return trip can be added, thus making uso of all observations. To get s measure for the reIative performance of the timekeepers and accordingly to assign weights to tho results by the seveial chronometers, their variations in rates during the several trips were made the criterion. Thua, let l,, &, 4 . . . . I,, be the values for the difference of longitude for the different trips by any cl~ronometer,and let 1 be its mean value; then the weight p to the chronometric result is giveu by - 1) p = )t -. (n [(I where n = number of round trip8 and x it constant introduced for tho sake of convenience. The resulting difference of longitude of each round trip was further subject to weighting, dopending on the duration of the trip, and was taken iriversely proportional to the number of days consumed. A further refinement for (roughly) taking iuto account the loss in time occasio~ied by unfavorable weather for transit observations, in which caso the rate of the observing chronometer had to be depended on, is readily rnade by adding this interval to the days of actual travel. The symmetry of the arrangement .was interfered with toward the close of the work by exchanging or transferring certain chronometers from one steamer to the other. The object was to strengthen the result fkom the last round trip between Tacoma and Sitka. It had, however, the effect of rendering the results from the two determinations (longitudes of Sitka and of Yakutat) to some extent dependent upon one another as t o weights of the chronometers carried in both expeditions.

DESCRIPTION OF LONGITUDE STATIONS.

A t Tacoma, Wash., the astronomical station of 1898 was established by Assistant Prrttt in the northeast corner of Wright Park. It is connected with the triangulation of Puget Sound. A t Sitka, Alaska, the new astronomical station was located i n May, 1892, by Subassietant Moree. Tho older stations of 1867,1869,and 1874 were on the Parade Ground,* and that of 1880 on Japollski Island,t but in 1892 these locations were found undesirable fbr various reasons. Tho new station is in front of the Presbyterian church,on an outcroppirig ledge. A pier of brick :md cement was constructed and capped with a block of granite. A t tlie close of the season tho pier marks. Assistant Davidwas left staiiding. Its position is further secured by a nuinber of wit~iess son's station of 1867 (also of 1869) was relocated and found to be nearly 33.6 metres south and 21.8 metres east of the 1803 station. These liurubers correspond to n 9 = 11'.06 and A 1 = 11'.30 to reduce the old to tlie new ~tatiou. The station of 1874 mas also on the Parade Ground, in fi'ont of the officers' quarters. It is not identical with, though near to, the station of 1867-69. A t Yakutat Bay the astronomical station of 1892 was located on the narrow strip of land known as Turriers Poiut, a t the southeastern end of IChantaalr Island, Port Mulgmve. It is to the northwest of the Indian village and soparated from it by a sriiall lagoon. A pier mas built of brick laid in cement arid surrnoulited by a stone cap. It is supposcd to be sufliciently off the beach not to be disturbed by the minter storms. The positio~l is :dso secured by two reference marks (copper bolts in rocks). The Dall and Baker aetronornical station of 1874 $ was southeasterly of the 1892 station and nearer to the orid of the point of land. It is nearly 204 metres, or 911.50, south, and 301 metres, or 19/'.l'i, east of the new station, according to Assistarit Turner's topographic survey.

The steamer Hassler, after receiving the Greenwich noon signals on April 25 and April 28, 1892, a t Port Townsend, as telegraphed from the Mare Islaud Navy-Yard, Cal., started from that port for Sitka with fourteen chronometers on board. A short stop was mado a t Port Simp~on where a set of transit observations mere made by Ensign H. C. Poundstono, May 6, for a determination of the longitude of this place. The Hassler reached Sitka May 14. The sea rate of any of the chronometers was then unknown, aud ti first trial mas made for determining h Sitka, using the mixed rates as found a t Port ~ o w n s c n d for Sid. chronometers 380 and 387 and M. T. chronometer 4969, the stationary rates as found a t Sitka for Sid. chronometers 3479 and 194 and M. T. chronometer 1707, and tho rates for M. T. clirouometers 1327,1347, and 1745 were made to depend on the rate curve, a function of temperature as determined a t the Mare Island Navy-Nard. The results from this proceeding proved unsatisfactory, and a second computatior~was made, employing the sea rates as'found from tho first round trip from Sitka to Yakutat, but omitting the six chronometers first named as of little importance. The results for A Sitka and those for Port Simpson worked out by this second more satisfactory method are as follows :

REPORT OF MARCH 28, 1894.

I have the honor to submit herewith tho results for difference of longitude of three stations in southeastern Alaska, in continuation of what was done last year for the establishment of certain standard positiolis in the Territory. The differences of longitude determined in 1893 are tho result8 of chronometer transportations from and to Sitka, as the standard station, and comprise the astronomical and geodetic stations Taku, Fort Wrangell, and Burroughs Bay. Tlie method of reduction is the same as that adopted for last year's work and is fully explained in my report of December 27,1893. The office computation was made by Xr. D. L. Hazard. Tinte observations a t Sitka.-The transit observations more made by Subassistant F. Morse, a t the Parade Qround station of 1892, with meridian telescope No. 16, between May lG and August 25, 1893. This instrument is one of tlie larger meridian telescopes and needs no further description here. Transits mere noted over nine lines. Tiinn was kept by observing chronolneter Hutton No. 104 (sidereal). Daily comparisons mere made with M. T. chronometer No. 1713 and sidereal chronometer No. 1458. Tinte ob~ervationsat Taku.-Meridian telescope No. 9, one of tlie slnaller insfrumonts, was used for the determillation of time; Aid 0. B. French, observer (11. G. Ogdeu, chief of party), from May 16 to Septembcr 1, 1803. T_rsnsits were notod over five liues. Time mas kept by observing chronometer Fletcher No. 1607 (N. T.) between May 16 and 81. After that time sidereal ohrononleter Eutton No. 202 was used. M. T. chronometers Huttoll No. 231 and Nogus 1542 wero compared a t the statioii and kept rated. Tinze obse~.z?atio?ts a t Port Wra?tgell.-At this place meridian telescope No. 13 was monnted. E. TittObservations for time wero made by Subassistant Q. B. Putilam and Aid H. O. Lord (0. wann, chief of party) between May 12 and September 9,1893. Though thirteen lines wore ruled on tlie diaphragm, but five were used in the transit work. Sidereal chronometer Negus No. 1771 was observiug chronometer. Sidereal chronometer Negus No. 1841mas compared with i t and rated until June 1,when its mninsprilig broke. On June 17 sidereal chronoliieter Negus No. 1589 took its place. M. T. chronol~ieterHuttoii No. 229 was also rated a t this place, but found very poor. Personal equation mas observed on July 7, and tho observations mado by Lord between July 22 and August 1 woro referred to Putnam, observer. Time observations at Burrouglts Bay.-Meridian telescope No. 7 was used here for time observations betweell May 1 G and September 3,1893; H. W. Edmouds, observer (13. F. Dickens, chief of party). But five of the fifteen liues of the diaphragm mere used. Sidereal chronometer Hutton No. 223 was employed for observing; M. T. chronometer Bond No. 177 and sidereal chronometer Hutton No. 207 wero kept rated; No. 177, however, proved uudesirable. Cl~rononleter transportation on the Uttited States Coast and Geodetic Survey steaqnw Hmalm.The chroriometors on board the steamer were in charge of H. C. Lord (F. Morse, chief of party). Daily comparisons wero made between the nine chronometers carried by tlie Hmaler, and seven round trips wero made from Sitka to the other stations, which wore visited in succession. The resulting differences of longitude were tabulated, following the plan adopted the previous year,

I have the honor to report herewith the results of the ,determinationof severaI standard astronomic positions in southeastern Alaska, the observations having been made during 1892, 1893, and 1894. The chronometric longitude expeditions of Alaska in 1892 and 1893 depend for their results on the longitude of Tacoma, Wash. I n May and June, 1894, this place was connected with the telegraphic longitude system a t Seattle, Wash., with the following result from the office computation : Tacoma west of Seattle, 0" 00" 276.169 08.0098 (see Supplement 1). Longitude of Tacoma, 8h Ogn 47".48 ZL 06-08 (see Supplement 2). The results of the chronometric expeditions to Sitka and Yakuht in 1892 are given in my report of December 27,1893, and the results of the expeditions in 1893 to Port Wrangell, to Taku, and to Burroughs B i y are contained in my report of March 28,1894. The latitudes of these stations were likewise reported. Putting the results together, we get the following values for h of standard positions in southeastern AJaska. They are conriected with local trian ylations and they form the basis upon which the survey of this part of Alaska will depend for its geographical positions.

Respecting local deflections in longitude at Tacoma, Seattle, and Port Townsend, me have the geodetic and astronomic difference of Tacouia and Seattle as follows: A A, = 6' 49"-417 and n A, = 278.159 = 6' 47/'.30, hence differential local deflection 2".02, a reasonably small quantity, showing that the deflection a t Port Tomsend is very much larger.

I t is in the north end of Wright's Park, on the east side, near G street, and in the prolongation of First street south to the west. The pier is on a small knoll and is a few paces north of the park walk; it is dressed to 24 by 15% inches at the top and has cut on the upper surface : S. C. & G. S. There is a copper bolt to mark the station, as described by Assistant Pratt. Assistant Davidsqn placed a granite pier 3% feet long to the south of the observatoryand in the meridian of the transit instrument,498)4 feet distant; and farther south,on the western edge of a spur, a second granite pier, 934 feet from the station, was planted in the same meridian. It is intended that these stones shall serve for a meridian line for the use of surveyors. At Seattle the station of 1888 was used. I t was originally described by Assistant Gilbert in 1886, but was slightly remodeled by Assistant Smith in 1888. It is located in the grounds of the University. Since the location of the University is to be changed, the present grounds may be converted into a city park.

DISTRIBUTION O F THl3 MAGNETIC DECLINATION IN ALASKA AND ADJAOENT WATERS FOR THE YEAR 1895, AND CONSTRUUTION O F AN ISOGONIC CHAltT FOR THE SAME EPOCH.
By C. A. ~crio'rr, Assistant. Submittod'for publication Decomber 19, 1894.

Prior to the year 1892 our knowledge of the annual change of the magnetic declination was very imperfect over the vast region comprising the coast of Alaska, and still more for the interior. Since that time, however, observations niade by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, especially those in connection with the survey of tlie boundary during the years 1889-1894, as well as information gathered from other sources, greatly aided in assigning ilnproved values to the annual change and in clearing up obscure cases and giving new information a t certain points. I n the higher latitudes the eval~iation of the annual change presents special difficulties in consequence of the paucity of the nlaterial and the comparatively large-diurnal variation which has to be allowed for ill the resulting declination. As an illustration of the change brought about by tho additional testiiilony of late observations, tho case of Sitka may be taken. Here the records up to 1881 and deduced curve given in Appendix No. 7, Report for lSS8, pakes 285-287 arid plate KO.23, strongly indicated decreasing declination for the present time; yet the observations of 1892, 1803, aud 1804, mado a t the same spot, flatly contradicted this inference and established the fact of an increasing easterly declination a t this pl<we,*and consequently also for a considerable region about it. Further proof of an increasing easterly decliriation in southeastern Alaslra was obtained a t Fort Wrangell in 1893. A t Port Simpson, however, no fresh evidence has been fortllcoming since 1885, when a small increase was indicated. I n this region, up to 1892, it was believed that the direction of the magof what was netic needle was eitlier stationary or slightly moving westward. This uncertai~ity going on extended even as far soutll as the State of Washington. Observations had to be specially ordered for Seattle and Tacoma., with tho result that here also the easterly declination was of this motion resulted from a discusfound to be still advancing (May, 1894). Further evider~ce sion of observations collected for Esquirnalt (Victoria), Vancouver Island, between the years 1858 and 1892. A11 this shows that tlie ribbon, shown on the chart in Appendix No. 7, Report for 1888, covering the space of stationary condition of the magnetic needle, ueeds correction and mu$ be locatetl more toward the eastern part of the State of Washington. The dilEculty of ascertsining the annual change for places in Alaska rnay be further illustrated in the CiNe of Yakutat Bay, where the survey of 1892 brought out the fact of a deflection of the needle of 47) a t Khantaak Island, as compared with other places on the bay, and these later observations demanded the cancellation of the annual change of +B1.8 on the isogonic chart for 1890 (constructed in October, 1889)t placed against this locality aud tlie substitution of the words "annual change inappreciable."
I n consequence of this tlio cornpaas placed on the older harbor oharts had to 1)e corrected in tho new insnes by nenrly 1 degree. t Cl~nrt No. 26, i\l~pondixKO. 11, Roport for 1880.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY. With respect to the interior of Alaska, the most important station where information was eccured in 1889 and 1890 is Fort Yukon, where the declination was fouud decreasing a few minutes per annum, in entire conformity with tho easterly decline noticed to take pl;ace all long tho shores washed by Bering Sea and tlie Arctic Ocean. The fortunate recovery of Bering's magnctic observations made on his first voyage to the coast^ of Kamchatka and eastern Asia in the years 1725 to 1730, and their discussio~i by me in December, 1890 (published in Bulletin No. 20, December 12,1890, and in Appel~dix No. 5, Report for 1891), greatly extended aud improved our knowledge of the secu1;tr variation of the declination in this part of the world and rnodified the a t stations on the opposito or American coast. former values of the annual cl~ange Fully five years have elapsed since tlie production by the Coast and Geodetic Survey of an tho wholo of Alaska Territory and adjacent regions, during which interval isogonic chart coverii~g so much of new information has become available, either in the shape of discovery of old records or of new observations, together with recent discussions, tliat an entire reconstruction of the isogonic chart became a necessity in order that the charts of this territory and tho approaclies thereto may have their compass variations correctly indicated. For this the epoch 1895.0 wak determined upon, Ieaving future improvements to be made for a chart for the year 1900. For the reduction of the observed declinations to the epoch I have made use of all informaor no tion a t present available, resorting to interpolation in regions where oiily an ap~roxri~iiato value for the annual change could be obtained. I t is the uncertainty arising from this circuinstance which determined mc to adopt 1895 rather than 1900 for the epoch. The values adopted for tlie annual change a t thirty-seven localities, distributed over the mllole area are give11 below. inability to procure any, in the western part The entire absence of late observ;ltions, or rather ~r;y of Bering Sea and aloug the coast of eastern Siberia and Karnchatka, rendered it desirable to restrict the geographical extent of the investigation in the west to about 1750 west longitude, as otliern~ise imperfect data near the Asiatic coast would have an itijurious influence on our results. There are two ways of coiistructing isogonic curves-by ineans of a graphical and by means of an analytical process. The former is here out of the question by reason of the large geographic extent involved and the scarcity and irregularity of distribution of the observations. In fact, the of magneticalIy disturbed regions, i. e., graphical treatment is better adapted for investigatior~s for the construction of isabnormal lines or curves of equal anoma,ly. The declination ( D ) (reduced to epoch) a t any place within the spherical surface under oonsideratidn may be expressed as a function of the latitude (p)and of the longitude (A). Tlie form and number of terms of the function adopted is the same as used by me in the preceding invostigati011 in 1889, and is as follows:

where n p = e, - 90, nA = h - Ao, and r, R, t, U, v, w, E , y, z, represent unknown numerical coefficients to be determined from the observations themselves. Terms involving highor powers in g, and A than the third could be dispensed with. The values of qoand A, represent the average latitude and the average longitude of the magnetic stations, respectively, and Dois tho value of the declination corresponding to it. For the latter me take the approximate value D, and find the correction, q, to it; hence .Do= Dl + q. Applying the method of least squares to the i~roblem, the observation equations take the form D1-D+q g,1.r+Al cos q~. 8 91'. t 9 1 A, COB g, u 11' ~ 0 8 '9 V q l R . w + q12 Al cos g , . x + 91h ~ ~ c y o. sy~ $ A13cos3SF, .Z where for shortness we write p1for ng, aud 1 I for n A. Of these equations there are as many as there are observations, but as any large number would be either cumbersome or unmanageable, the observatioris need to be contracted into mean values, i. e., groups or so-called normals. The next step is the formation of the ten normal equations and the evaluation of the unknowns q ... ..-2. The success of the work is to be measured by

The numodcal dquation expressivo of D being thus established, n sufficient number of point8 for the deliuestion of any isogonic line can rosdily be computed, and consequently tho mholo system of isogonic curves laid down on a suitable chart. The selection of tlie groups depends primarily on the geographic positions of the magnetic stations, but must be such as to cover implicitly the whole area, and wit11 the groups distributed over it in such a way as to give great weight to the coefflcients of the equation determining the declinations. Theoretically, ten groups suffice; but the greater their iiumber the better will be the general representation.

Even the earliest observation, that by Captain (look in 1779 a t Karakakoa Bay y = 190 28/, A = 1560001,and the one by Assistant Preston a t the same place in August, 1892 (station called Napoopoo, 9 = 19029/, A = 155059/), when compared, point to tho same direction of change. The singular oval area of west declination lying across tho east coast of Asia, which was formed, or rather left in place, by tho breaking through, about the close of the first quarter of the present century, of tho area of eastern declination across its southern neclr, is apparently elicroaching upon the western part of Bering Sea. Its central maximum declination has increased from 70 to 100 and the agouic line a t its eastern boundary is now supposed to pass in the vicinity of P9tropavlovsk. A t this place, in particular, new observations are needed before reliable results of the distribution of the declination over the westeru Bering Sea can be deduced.

THE LENGTH OF THE HOLTON BASE LINE, INDIAXA, WITH ltELATED EXPERIMENTAL MEASURES DURING PART OF JULY, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER, AND OCTOBER, 1891; A. T. NOSMAX, ASSISTANT, IN CHARGE O F THE PARTY.

Reported by CHARLEB A. SCIIOTT, Aaaistnnt. Submitted for publication Auguat 23, 1894.

Introduction.-The Holton base is one of the linear measures which support the transcontinental triangulation. It is located in Ripley County, southeastern Indiaua, distant about 330 kilometres ikon1 the St. Albans base, West Virginia, to the eastward, and distant about 240 kilometres from the Olney base, Illinois, to the wsstward. Its middle point is in latitude 390 03/-3,arid in longitude @ o 22l.2 west of Greenwich. The liuo is inclined to the meridian 4 O 0G1.3, tho aziinuth of the north end being 1750 BY.8 (counted from south to west). Tlie length of the baso is 5.501 kilometres nearly, and tlio approximate height above the average sea level 283 metres. Appendix No. 8, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1892, contains u full account of the lneasurement of this base by the observers, A. T. Mosmm, who had general charge; by It. S. Woodward, Assistant, in charge of the mt?:~tiures with tlio bar-in-ice appar:btus aud experilnents with metallic tapes, and by 0. I I . Tittmann, Assistaut, in charge of the coutact-elide base apparatus. This appendix gives the reports of these observers, headed with a preface by the Superintendent. It comprises 174 pages, and renders i t uilnecessary to enter liore into certain detail matter already stated or discussed in that place, except whon directly coniiected with the base lneasurell or couipntations. The primary base liues heretofore measured by the Survey, as well as all other lengths determiued by it, depend for their unit on tho Committee metro of 1799, tlie property of tho American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, but this unit of length was superseded in 1890 upon the receipt by tho United States of tho National Prototype metres. The Holton baso is the first prominent one which depends for its length on this new standard unit, and in consequellce an accoutrt must be given here of some intermediate operations, introduced with e view to express the measured length of the baso in terms of the prototype. For this purpose a new and most accurate base apparatus was designed and brought into use by Assistant Woodward, for description of which see Chapter I of Appendix NO. 8. This bar-in-ice apparatus was used for staridarclizing the now contact-slide bars employed in tho measure of the base after its own leugth had been compared with that of tho prototype metre. The same appendix treats a t length of the experiments and results of tape measures. These are of less importance in conr~ection with the Eolton base, but will be found more fully referred to in the report on the length of the St. Albans bnse. The Holtofe base and its measures.-The site for the base was selected by Assistant Mosmali in October arid November, 1890. I t is on a ne:irlylevel table-land between the towns of Holton and

A11 lneasures with the contact bars were with rising temperatures, and in direction one measure of the base was made forward, the other backward. The surface morlurnerits wid subsurface marks of the ends of the base are described and illustrated in Appendix No. 8." Section stones set iu concrete and marlied each witli a fine cross, cut on the head of a copper bolt securecl in it, were placed a t distances of 1.2, 2.1, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 kilometres from south end. Stones were also set a t 3.9 and 4.9 kilometres to mark the end points of the kilolnetres iutended fbr the measure with the bar-in-ice. These stories are marked by spherical-headed bolts in connection with the use of tho so-called cut-off apparatus. A t the camp near JIolton thero was also established under a covered shed a standard 100-lnetre comparator. I t s longth was found from measures mith the bar-in-ice apparatus, and i t served for comparing or testing the co~nbinedlength of tlie coutact-slide bars as well as for ascertaining in particular the length of metallic tapes and for other purposes.

In accordance with the conclusions reached by the observer, we sliall :idopt for the lengtli of B,, the value 6" - 16.2 p 1.1p, where the increased proba,ble error is due to tlie introduction of the probable error 4 -2 p for Pzl; but in case the same observers (Woodward and Siebert) determine the length by tlie same method, as they have done a t the Holton base, the special value (for A end right) 5"' - 18.0 p & 1.3 p is to be used.* Determinatio?~ of the coeflcicnt of expansion of contact-slide rods ilTos. 13 and 14.-The observations for the coefficient of expansion were made in the con~paring vault of the office in May, 1891, by Assistant 0. H. Tittmann arid L. A. Fischer, adjuster W. arid M. For this purpose the ends of the steel rode (subsequeutly numbered 13 and 14)f were cut down to the medial 1)1aneand platinum-iridium plugs, 5.02 metres apart, were inserted. Two Iines on the left-hand and three oti the right-hand plug served for making the micrometric measures wl~entho rods were under observation. The general plau of operation was to compare the two rods through a large range of temperature alternately, as well as a t high temperatures and a t freezing temperatures. This was done by lnountirig the two rods in a zilic-lined trough, side by side, a r ~ dby immersion in a solution of borax water, or packed i n melting ice, as reqnired. A fiecond trough was provided for the case of one rod in ice and the other a t a high temperature. The thermometers Tonnelot Nos. 4654, 4655, 4656 were compared \vith the standards 4623 and 4624; hence the following table of corrections :

the 101 bars 139 to 240, and with an avorage difference of 930 for the 100 bars 1000 to N. B., iu which last caso tho difference in longth amounted to zero. Tho question of the relative temperatures of the rods and thermometers * was inquired into and from experiments mado on August 26,1891, when the length of tho camp hectometre was measure(2 seven times, i t would appear that the rods tsko up changes of temperature faster than tho thermometers; in other wotds, the thermometer indications lag about 00.3 0. To test the buhavior of the apparatus under bright sulishinet the base hectometre was measured five times on Septeniber 21 and eight tirnos on September 22, with tho resnlt that the lag was practically insensible during bright sunshine, being only 03-07. Raspecting any uncertainty in the length of the baso that might arise through lag of thermometer! (with respect to the rods), i t should be remembered that the rods wero standardized under tho same condition of rising temperature as obtained when the base was measured; hence the assignod length of 2 (13 and 14) refers to this (rising temperature) condition and no correction to the deduced length$ of the base is needed. On October 5 and G, 1891, some special observations wore mado for testing the length of the apparatus wlien used during falling temperature, in which case the thermometers sh'ow too high. Tho amount of lag deduced (nearly 40) seems quite uncertain on account of the short distance measured and the small chango of hmperature, only about 20 on the 5tth and no sensible change on the 6th. Tho variations in the deduced lougth of 2 (13 and 14), as found by means of measures of a known distance (as found by the bar-in-ice apparatus), appear quite large, as may bo seen from the tabular values given on pages 492,494, and 495 of Appendix No. 8. These variations are supposed due mainly to tho varying rates of temperature changes. The effect of this on the base measure is supposed to be included in the above probable error of the measure. Any uncertainty in tho zero correction of the thermometers would be felt as a constant error, and estimating it as f 00.03 0. mo would have for one bar ZL .05872mmx '03 and for 1100 bars 4 11.4u1n1.

The range in height is but 219 feet, and in general the ground rises in proceeding from south to north. The north end of the base is 9.0 feet, or 2.743", above its southern end. The average elevation of the line above its south end is 14.44 feet, or 4.401". Bench mark LXVII of the transcontinental line of spirit levels3 ma8 connected with the north end of the base by levehg. This operation was performed by Mr. J. S. Siebert, who measured forward between June 16 and June 22 and backward between June 23 and 27,1891. He found difference B. M. LXVII and north base = 429.77 feet, and north base and B. M. LXVII = 430.03 feet, respectively; mean difference, 429.90 feet, or 131.04 metres; hence height of north base 150.61m 131.04m,and of average base 283.31". Adding to this 3.80 feet or 1.16 metres for height of bars above ground and subtracting 2 feet, or 0.61 metres, for correction to height of bench mark LXVII, we get for height of base above the sea 283.86"; hence reduction to sea level - 0*2455", a n d the final result for length of base becomes 5500-6G4", and its logarithm 3,740 4073. f4 &3

This is the length of the base as marked by the base monuments, but the triangulation station "south base" was Glum inside the line; hence length of base for introduction to the triangulation 6600.568mand its logarithm 3.740 4068 4 4 43 The steel tape measures o f the Holton base.-During part of August, September, and October, 1891, certain experimental work was undertaken a t the Holton base,'having for its object the inquiry into the practicability of the .application of long metallic tapes for the measure of base lines of precision. These researches were conducted by Assistant Woodward, whose report on the results reached will be found in Appendix No. 8, 1892, pages 413-434. Brietly stated, the operations consisted in standardizing two 100-metre ssteel tapes, under given teusion and temperature, on the camp hectometre, and these were in turn used for the measure of the Holton base. The six sections of the base were measured from six to thirty times each, under various circumst.&nces,as to temperature, state of weather, day or night, ek., and the behavior of' the ta,pes was especially show11 by the numerous measures of the base kilometre. Hero t l ~ e advantage a tape measufe has over a bar measure could he fully realized- that is, the tape could be standardized a t its total length and the nleasures of the base could be multiplied to a great estent without much cost when once the line had been prepared for tape measure. Thus the probable error of the long unit could be made extremely small and the mere error of measure of the base could be reduced to a minimum. The presence of constant errors are therefore those most to be feared with tape measures. Assistant Woodward adopts the length of the camp hectometre :b8 follows (page 423 of Appendix 8):

Between August 6 and October 9, 1891, the dietanco Ho mas recorded seventy-seven times with tape No. 85, and betweeu August 1and October 9, 18!)1,the distance was recorded cight.y-five times with tape No. 88. When these measureb were made tho temperature ranged between 320.1 C . and 30.5 C. From these comparisons i t follows that the probable error of a single measure of the length of tape No. 85 is 4 0-171nm, and for tape No. 88 & 0.22mm. For the standard temperature 160.89 C,, the resulting excess of tape T, over the length 20 B 1 , was found to equal 2 2 ~ 3 5 ~a11d ~ ~ 1the , same equations made the expansion of the tapo 1-0947"" for 1 0 C. ;hence the,length of T, supported a t intervals of 10 metres and a t a tension of 25 pounds and 9 ounces: T m= 20 B17+ 22.35mm+ 1.0947mm ( t 160.89) and ~irnilarly for the other tape 4 -02 4 21 = 20 BI7+ 23.47mm + 1.0914'nm( t - 160.52) * -02 & 32 or Tm= 100.02199m+ 1.0947mm ( t - 160.89) here the probable error assigned includes all 4 4 4 26 T , = 100.02311 + 1.0914 ( t - 160.72) knowu eources t 4 4 4 26 and for any temperature t : Ta5= 100 003.60mm 1.0947mm t Tse = 100 005.95 1.0914 t

With these values the various measures with the tapes of the Holton base and of its parts were computed; hence the results reached by the tapes can be directly compared with the results deduced from the bar measures. The thirty tape measures of the base kilometre afford an excellent means for judging of the practical outcome of such measures. Part of the followi~~g table is transferred from page 445 of Appendix No. 8. The last column gives the error of measure a A compared with the true length E = 1000" - 3.4"" 0.4"", in the sense of observed -true, and a negative sign iudicates tape measure too short.

It will be noted that the day measures of October 3 and 7 give results largely in error, whereas the mean of the night (evening) measures is fairly correct. Further attention may be called to t,hho substantial agreement with each other and with the triie value of the measures of the base kilometre from the two tapes, their disagreement boing less than the millionth part of the length of the line. Assistant Woodward concludes from the measures of the standard kilometre that the temperatures of the tapes when uscd a t night in the open air were substa.ntially as well defined by the mercuriaI tl~ermorneters as when the tapes were used under the slled of tho 100-metre camp comparator, and he further points out that as a rule the day measures give results relatively too short. be nsed, though with less confidence, if we adopt the equaSuch measures call ~levertlieless tion of tho tapo to tho special condition of d i ~ y (sunshine) measures. When this is done the results may be combined with tho results of tho night or after-sundown measures. To effect this the length of the tape, to make it suitable for d i y measure, must be take11 0.74n11u longer than its value adopted for night measures. The following tablo exhibits a comparison betwoen the results by the bar and tape measures of the length of the several sections of the base. Two sets of results are givon for tho tape measures, one depending solely on the night (after sundown) measures, the other del~ending on t,he night and day measures after the standard length of the tapes had been changed to correspond to tho case of insolation. Certain results of August 27 and 28 mere rejected as being untrustworthy, and all measures of Soptember 4 were omittiad as affected by a strong breeze, rising to a gale a t intervals.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Taking the night measures alone and forming the differences of each single measure from the mean value of the respective sections, the observer deduces from forty-six measures covering the six sections (excluding a seveuth section of 100 metres) the probable error of a measure of a single tape & 0 . 1 j 5 and ~ ~ the probable error of a single measure by the tape of a kilometre f 1.74m111, which equals nearly don part of the le~lgtli. The probable error of his adopted Iength of the whole base (5500.832m) is given on page 454 of Appendix No. 8 as k3.68mm, which n.early equals r43+-0-bii part of the length. According to the probable errors assigned to tho resultant values of the length of the base by the measures with the contact-slide apparatus and with the tape apparatus i t mould appear that the two measures are of about equaI value and each subject to a probable error of about part of the length.* This shows part of the length, whereas they differ by 17mm,or about H+O-oT that the assigned probable errors can not be depended upon, and the prevalence of minus differences in the above table would indicate the presence of some c o n ~ t a n error t or errors not taken into account. So far as triangulation is concerned, even an uncertainty of one three-hundredtho~sandt~ part h mould not be considered excessive. The great differerlce in the n~easllres of the l m t 600 metres, which amounts to d6 part, nearly, is remarkable, especially since the eeparate measures agree well among themselves. It mould seem quite plain that the great accuracy apparently reached with the tape apparatus must in any case depend on the close attention paid by the observer to the minutest detail involved in the operation as well as upon favorable atmospheric conditions during the night measures. There appears to be no good reason why the results obtained by the bars and tape sllould not be united to a final resuIt for the length of the Holton base. The difference in the results, however, indicates the presence of constant errors; hence the taking of the simple mean value is indicated. The two measures were not made a t the same level. I n the case of the tape measures we have their average elevation above south base about 4.gm, and with north base 2.61m above south base, and allowing 0.61m for the correction of the line of spirit levels, we obtain tho average height of the tape, 283.33" hence the reduction to sea level, - 0.2450m,and the length of the base, 5500.387m. The mean length, 4 (5500.664 + 5500.687), equals 6500.576m4 8.4m1n. The probable error is of course very uncertain, but may be taken as part of the length. The base to be introduced in the triangulation is therefore 5600.570m, and its logarithm 3.740 4077 0. zt 8 & 66

Introduction.-The St. Albitns base line forms part of the trai~scontinental triangulation near tho thirty-nillth parallel of latitude. I t is situated ill the valley of the Great Kailawha River, near the village of St. Albans, in Kauawha County, w. Pa. The neaiSestbase iu this triangulation, to the e:lstward of it, is tho Kent Island base, Rfaryla~rd, distant from it about 045 kilouletres as measured ill tlie axis of the triangulation, and to the westward nre h:tve the Holton baaa, Iutliatla, about 330 kilouietres distult. Tho middle point of' the base is ill latitude 38O 23'4, and in longitude 810 48l.9 west of Gree~iwicli;tlle aziti~utlr, east end to west eud, is 108O 03'-9 (countetl from the south westward). The length of the base is liearly Y.S;O ltiloli~etre~, and it lies about 180 metres above the average surface of the ocean. Tho line betweell tho end points is nearly level throughout. Tlris is the second base of precision the measure of which was effected by means of metallic tapes, aricl the first one where the tape meesures wore elnployed exclusive of otlier means. The experinlcut~l work a t the Holtori bitso, Indiana, iu tllo proceding Year, illvolved the question of the comparative merits of the cotitact slide apparatus a11(1of the ht1)e 81)p;\1'9t~~, when used for precise measures, and i t was concluded that results by tllo latter could be fully trusted in those cases in which the requisite minute attention is paid to all circulllstallces wliich have or may have influeuce on tlie result. Among tlicse influences tile condition of the atmosphere is the most potent, and measures made after suudown or during [light timu wero considered as made under more favorable circumstances than day measures. For a com1)lete u~~derstarlding of the use of metallic tapes for the itbore purpose no better reference be given than tlie report of Assistant It. S. Woodward, by whom the method was developed 011 tile Survey. (See Appendix No. 8, Report fbr 1892.) Tlie base was located in the summer of 1891, by Subassistant W. B. Fairfield. Tho terminal stones were set and the profile of the line and its connectioll with the height of the triangulation were ascertained under the direction of Assistant A. T.Mosman. The ground a t west base is 0.5 metre below the top of the stake a t east base. I n October, 1892, the base wa8 measured by the Party in charge of Assistant R. S. M7oodward. The line had been cleared of obstacles; and the lnerlrillg and supporting stakes for the tapes had

120

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC: SURVEY.

been placed throughout its length. These stakes were set 10 metres apart, aligned and cut to slope for each tape length. A 1 measures were made between October 10 and October 14; of these, one was merely experimental for training tho party to the manil)ulation. Four were made a t night and one during bright sunshine, but this latter was not em~~loyed for determining the length of the base. Of the four effective measures two were forward and two were backward Inea,sures by means of the steel tapes Nos. 85 and 88, previously employed, and standardized a t the Holtoxl camp and base, Indiana. The dimensions of theso tapes are, length, 101.01 metres; cross section, 6.34 by 0.47 millimetre; their weight i s 22.3 grammes per metre of length. The end graduations fall about half a metre from the tape ends; when not in use the tapes aro rolled up on reels. A s stated in Appendix No. 8, Report for 1892, and in my report on the length of t.he Holton base, Indiana (of August 23,1894), the standard lengtl~s of the tapes were found by repeated measures of the l~ectometre standard a t the Holton camp, which length was laid down by means of the barin-ice apparatus. The length of this bar, kuown as B17, was found to be ti metres - 18.0 microns in 4 1.1 terms of the iriternational metre and when a t the temperature of molting ice, as determined by Assistant Woodward and Mr. Siebert; and the lengths of the tapes aro given as*

This is for the standard temperature of 25 pounds 9 ounces and for the temperature t of the centigrade scale (referred to hydrogen). During the measure of the base the actual tension applied was but 25 pounds 6 ounces, which shorten8 the length of each by 0.14"'"'. In all measures Assistant Woodward was the observer a t the front end, and Assistant Haskell a t the rear end, and the thermometers from which the tape teniperature mas inferred were read by these observers. The base was divided into four sections, representing approximately kilometres excepting one section of about 869 metres. The fractional part of a tape was obtained directly from the 20-metre subspaces of the tapes, and a remaining portion of 9 metres was measured by means of an auxiliary 15-metresteel tape, divided to millimetres. The several positions of the tapes were marked on zinc plates left in position throughout the measures, the marks on which form part of the record. Reepecting grades, the greatest difference in height of the plades for any tape length was 3.571 metres. The corrections to the thermometer readings during the base measures are as follows:

These thermometers were provided with sheaths of thin steel tape slipped over their bulbs, in the hope of securing thereby a close approximation to the actual temperature of the tapes. Two thermometers were read when placed a t a distance of 10 metres from the ends of the tape; the third was placed a t the hiddle. The index correction to tho spring balance measuring the tension of the tapes was ascertained on five days between October 10 and 21.

(Appendig 8,1892.) The probable error, 2.32"m, of measure of the base is equivalent to one part in 1660 000. It may also be deduced from the four differences of the forward and backward measures.

PREFACE TO P A R T 111.

The following pages have been prepared for tlie purpose of supplying some of the immediate marits of the Tidal 1)ivisioli. They constitute Part X I 1 of a proposed manual of tides, the plan of which limy be outlined thus: Part I. History of' tides, including old methods of treatment. P a r t 11. Tidal observation, eqnilibrium theory, and harmonic analysis. P a r t 111. Connections between bal.monic and nonharlnonic qu:lutities. Part IV. Tidal theory aud astronolnical quantities deduced from tidal observations. P a r t V. Tidal c.urrcnts. Tables. Auxiliary tables and a collection of tidal constants, includirig cotidal charts. As no considerable portion of the material co~stitutillg Part 1 1 1is olsowhere available, it has seeilied desirable to publish i t in advance of Parts I and 1 1 ,whose subject-matter hrts been largely treated in various publications. Tllo object of this paper is, iu a gelieral way, indicated by its title; but it may not be out of place to colnrnellt here upou certaiii of its aims arid features. Owing to a lack of reasonably precise dotinitions and adequate modes of reduction, the nonharmonic constants (i. e. those referring to high and low water) liave too often been of little service where an accurate and satisfactory ltuowledge of the tide mas desired. It .is true that quite accurate prudictious have been made, based upon the tables resulting from nonharnionic discussions; but i t is to be observed (1) that the tables so used were designed chiefly for particular stations and so mere of little or no use generally; (2) that 10llg series of ~bservationswere necessary for the construction of such tables; (3) that most nonharmonic discussio~lshave b w n confined to s t a t i o ~ ~ where s the diurnal inequality is so small as to give 110 serious trouble. The present attempt to overcome these objections provides an approrimate method of analyzing a siiigle month's observations upon high and low water for obtainillg both tlie harmonic and the nonharmonic constants, regardless of the amount of diurnal inequality, slid \\rithout difficult computations. It also provides tables for the anJ y s i s and prediction of tides, designed for general 1160, regardless of the location of the station. Little atkiltion has heretofore been given to the classification of tides for the purpose of selecting the best possible port of reference for a given subordinate station, proximity in geographic position having been the sole criterion with few esce~tions. Now, i t is believed, are given for the first time such harmonic and nonharmonic criteria as will readily show how the types of tide a t different stations compare. I n this connectioll are given rules for referring one station to another. The chaptor entitled "Prediction of Tides describes a proposed tide-predicting .machine combining the merits of the Thomson and the Ferrel machines; a general graphic process enabling one (by means of a set of curves constructed once for all from the harmonic constants of the given station) to predict tides without a machine and without computation, the amount of work involved depending upon the accuracy desired; also an approximate arithmetical method for predicting high and low waters from certain tidal constants.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY. By correlating harmonic and nonharmonic quantities a better insight into tides is obtained may be inferred than from the consideration of either alone. I n this may observable phe~lomena froni harrr~olricconstants, i~lconsistenciesmay be detected, and Inissing quautities supplied; also particular values of ~ionhar~rionic quantities may be reduced to their mean values, and conversely. $5 46, 47 are given mainly for the purpose of furnishing a key t o tho study of Ferre17s nonharmo~iicao;tlysc?s. These discussions, covering years of observations, throw much light upon the. nature of' tidal inequalities. The apponded tables, already alluded to, are based principally upon those of Baird and Darwin. Tlie considerablo computation involved in their preparation has bee11 performed by members of the Tidal Division. Their scope differs somewhat from that of the paper accompanying them. This remal k applies especiaUy t o Tables 1to 13, which are designed for the harmonic analysis of tides from hourly ordinates, a subject to be treated in P a r t II. I have to ack~~owledge much assista~icefrom Mr. L. P. Shidy, wl~oso long experience in tidal work has rendered his advice particularly valuable, and whose cooperation has enabled the work to go on.

Small diurnal range is t h e difference between the mean of all the lower high waters and the mean of all t h e higher low waters of each day during one or more half tropical or declinational months. Great tropic range is the greatest periodic daily range of tide, uaua.lly occurri~ig soon after the moon is farthest north or south from the equator arld therefore nenr one of tho tropics. Small tropic range is tlie srnallest periodic daily range of tide, usually occurring soori after the moon is farthest north or south from the equator and therefore nenr one of the tropics.

I n summing for high aud low waters the tidal curve is actually read a t times whicli coultl be only approximately determined in advance, and which times depend to a considerable extent upon the height of the sea. In the former case the elevatious and depressions other than tl~ose due to tlie colnponerit (with its harrnonics) sougl~t will eventually become eliminated. I n the latter case we have the liberty of selecting readirigs a t about the fixed times of' luaxil~ln of the wave got by cornbi~ling all the tidal components. The mean range of the obscl.vet1 tide will always be greater than that of the theoretical tide. For, in orcler to get this observed range of tidu to agree with that of the theoretical tide, we monld have to observe t l ~ o height of the sea, at tlte theoretical or predictable time8 01'I~iglr, and low water.

This can be seer1 by referring to Tablo 18. When the moon is far from the equator-i. 0. when the diurnal wave is large--the position i8 nearly fixed.

37. I n this reduction the first process consists in tabulating the timos aud heights of high and low water, togetller with the times of transit of tho moon across some ltnown meridiiln. Tl~e next stop is the subtractiou of the transits from the times of the tides, usually selectillg such transits as will give t>he sm:tllest possible interval without introducing too many uegati\-e values. Before taking means of the intervals aud heights, the length of serles to be used lrlust be decided upon. Length of series suitable for jinding the se?nidiurnal range of tide and the mean lunitidal interval.-Siuce the variation in range, fro111day to day depends chiefly up011 the manner in which the semidiurnal components fall up011 Mz, the required length of series should be, a s r~early as possible, a multiple of the synodic poriods of SZ, N,, L,, Kz, with JI2; i. e. of tho form

series suited to the high waters is generally also suifed to the low waters, one should solve tlie above eqnation to the nearest lunar half day. This having been done, the results expressed in mean solar days are as follows : 29, 58, 87, 105, 134, 163, 192, 221, 250, 279, 297, 326, 355, 384. I t is often convenient to divide the series, whatever its length, into periods of 29 da,ys each. Since the transits of tlie true (not tlle mean) moon are used, tlie lunar semidiurnal coniponerits N2, L, lunar Kt, have little effect upon the interv:~l. Consequently tho syr~odic rrionth of' 298 days might seem to be a better length of series for tlie determination of the interval. But on account of the diurnal inequality in interval it is probable that even for this purpose 29 days would usually be preferable to 294. Having fixed upon tlie length of series to be used, the sums and means of the intervals and the heights.on stafi are then taken. The resulting intervals are reduced i;o a value which would have been obtained had local transits been used by adding

...

where E, 8,arid L are the west longitude in timo of the meridian of the transits, i. e. of tlie ephemeris used, of the (standard) timo meridian, and of the meridian of tho station,' respectively. Using now the corrected intervals or establishments (HWI, LWI) expressed ill hours, the epoch of M is (unless Xsbe large) 14.4921 ( H W I L W I 6.2103) = M20. ( 126)

The upper sign is used when the low water interval is taken greater less tliari the high water. lower The resulting LW height subtracted from the H W height gives the range of tide for the period of the observations. The intervals arld ranges just considered refer to tides occurring twice daily. For this reason when evanescent tides occur such days7 observations should be orriitted i n the surnmationu. If only a few occur they may be interpolated, or if a continuous record be available the points of maximum curv:~ture may be selected for the missing liigli and low waters.* For some purposes tlie average height of the higher lligli and lower low water may be useful, particularly for determining the great diurti:rl range of tide and the plane of referellce defined low water by lower low water. These heights are always obtainable, as one liigh water and o ~ l e occur each day, even when there are evanescent tides. 111 the first reduction, mark such height8 and take the mean of the quantities so marked. The length of series used for this purpose should be an integral number of tropical months, or, less accurately, of half tropical months. The following nulribers represent such periods expressed in mean solar days:

28. Determination of mean sea level and long-period tides. Where hourly heights of the tide are given, it is obvions that a suitable period of time for determining meau sea level would be one in which each of the principal tidal components 11ii~lies an integral number of oscillations. By taking mu1til)les of the liourly speed of each component, it is readily seen that the period of 29 meau solar days and zero hours is tlie best value obtainable unless the given herghts of period may be adopted for the the tide are taken a t intervals of less than one hour.

REDUCTION O F PERIGEAN, APOGEAN, AND M I D T I m TIDES.

32. Midtinte tiJcs. A nu~iiber of tides occurri~~g between perigee and apogee, also between apogee and perigee, are tabulated in tlie form headed "Midtime tides" fbr the purpose of ascertaining the relative age of the parallax wave. I t is generally ~ufficielitto begin the tabulation about a day and a half be1'ol.e the niidti~nevand to use on each oceilsion, say, 24 titles, thus covering nearly 6 lunar days. It is necessary to take pairs of ~riidtirllesbecause the age as determined from the ono following perigee may diil'er a day or two from the age as determined from the ouo following apogee. The from Tablo 24, column lieaded "0 tides," phase correction ernployed in this reduction is obtair~ed using the amplitude of Sz uncorrected for K, and T2. The phase correction fiecomes zero for a series about 220 days in length; i. e. when S midtimo groups of the same kind are combined into one. The last column shows the corrected range of tide for the times given in the colunln headed 4' Average." The r~oxt step is to plot tlieso ranges at the proper times-which times are one-half lunar day apart, very ~iearly-and to driaw a curve fitting the plotted values. Since tllese values usually appear as a double row of points, :I third row should be obtained lyilrg midway between theother two. I t may be seen by aid of Table 16 that a parallax inequality whose age is zero and which is !N should causo the rango of tide a t ~iiidtime to be about equal to its mean due to N,,L,, iind . value. Consequently one should mark upon each curve the tilno \rhen the range becomes equal to its mean value taken from tlie first reduction. Tho ti~ues of occurrence of tlieso ranges, diminished by the appropriate midtirnas, give, in tlie niean, the age of the parallax inequality. 33. Perigean and apogean tides. The age of the parallax inequality, when added to tile observatiori times of perigee and apogee, gives the times of groat,est and least parallax effect upon the range of tide. Before and after each of these times copy down, say, G tides, and deterlni~le the perigean and apogean ranges. Table 24, column lisade(1 " 6 tides,'' is employed in maltirig the correction for phase. The high ailcl low water diurnal inequalities are takeu a t the times of greatest and least parallax effect.

Whenever the amplitude of the diurnal wave is small in comparison with that of t h e semidiurnal, we have Iiange of diurnal wave = .\/( I1 W inequality )" ( LW inequality) 2 The mir~imum va.lue of this rauge a.ud the time of its occurrence are found by rnealis of the reduc ti011headed "Minimum diurnal tides." The time of this event diminished by tho observation time of moon on equator is t h e uncorrected age of t h e diurnal inequality, or of 0, relative to K1. I n deterrninii~g t h e minimnm diurnal tide, several days' observations should be used, beginning shortly before the moon crosses t h e equator.

Tho intersection of two curves upon Plato I11 which correspond to these ratios gives an amplitude (in terms of D,) and a HW phase.

It is here supposed that observations, or more likely predictions, simultaneous with the observations in question aro givexi for a neighboring principal station having a similar type of tide; i t is also supposed that the observations or predictions a t the principal station have beon reduced to a plane of reference liavilig the required definition. Determine from tlie observed heights a t the subordinate station s plano approaching the one which definition would require. Call this the approximate plane arid let IL donoto its height above the required plano. Find a r a ~ ~ of g etide by taking the mean of all observed low waters from the mean of all observed high uraters. Let H denote the height of the tides a t the principal station which correspond to the tides used in determining the approximate plane a t the subordinate station. Let

IL = r a. The more nearly r remains constant, the better tlie selection of the neighboring principal station. As a general rule field parties are supplied with tide tables giving predictions for the time in question. Now, uuless tlie predicted heights are referred to a plane of reference having the same tidal definition as the oue tc?bo determined, they must be reduced to such a plane by adding a constant which we must suppose to be given in the tido tables. To dispense with this labor, predictions and soundings should be referred to planes having uniform definitions over a considerable area. To avoid confusion, which is sure to result near the limits of each such area,, one . definition should be used the world over. 43.+ To determine mean sea level from one mont1~'s observations.-Use the period of 29 solar days. Take the menxi of avorage high and average low water, or the meall of the hourly ordinates if a continuous record be available. To determine mean low water from one month's observations.-Use the period of 29 solar days. Find the iuean range of tide aiid mean low water for this period. Reduce this range by the factor 3 (Mn), Table 14. Depress the observed mean low water by 4 (mean range - observed ineau range). (I*)
The value of (K, Ol)/M2 which is needed in Table 14 may be inferred from some neighboring station with sufficient accuracy for the present purpose, or i t may be found by means of 4 44. To determine meal&loioer low water from one month's observations.-Use tho period of 27 solar days, i. e. a declinational rnontl~.

Subtract this value from muan low water as determined from the 29-day period, and xiiultiply tho result by the factor 1.02 PI,Table 32. Depress the corrected mean low water by the quantity just obtained, and the result will be mean lower low water. no one reducing factor, like This plane of reference is unsatisfactory in accurate work, becamuse 4, applies well to all sti~tions.

When possible, mean sea level should be determined from hourly ordinates.

Mean low water (semidiurnal) is here of no consequenco as a plane of reference. The correction for annual and semiannual components is made as in 5 43.

I n all cases we shall assume that x corresponds to the hour of (local) transit of the moon, or to the moon's anomaly, longitude, etc., as the case may be, and not to the timo of high water, low water, or a mean of theso times; otherwise the value of x would correspond to a time a constant amount in advance or in retard of the moon's transit or other astronoluical argument. Ferrel adopted this assumption in his "Discussion of tides in New Pork Harbor."* I n earlier papers, notably i n his "Discussion of tides in Boston Harbornt and in his "Tidal researches,"$ he has not corrected tho e7s and a's for the luriitidal interval.

(174)

Having found this amplitude for each value of the moon's longitude (A), the constants involved in its expression may be determined. Let 1 1 sassume tho amplitudo to be (see Ferrel's New Pork tides, 5 22, 1. c.) K1 O1 sin (2 h,- a]') Ol1sin (4 h - allt). (175)

The number of hours by which the maximum amplitude of the diurnal wave follows an extreme declination of the moon is all - 900, = K1O - 010, divided by k l -0 or 1.098. This is the age of the diurnal inequality.

CHAPTER IV.
TO REDUCE RESULTS TO THEIR MEAN VALUES.

48. A11 tidal components which depond upon the moon are assumed to have slightly variable amplitudes in order to botter adapt them to each year of the luni-solar cycle. Tho reason for this is that if they had fixed amplitudes many additioual components would bo necessary to take into account this irregularity of the tide; moreover, those additional components would have periods differing so little from the periods of the compononts with which they are now combined that a long series of observations would be necesfiary for tlieir independent determination. Besides accou~lting for the small compo~~ents duo to the regression of the moon's node, the variation in the amplitudes may be made to talro into account still other componelits whose speeds are nearly equa.1to the speedti of those components with which thoy are combined. The factors F a n d f,for recluciug the amplitudes of the components obtained from a particular series to their mean vduos and vico versa, are giveu in Tables 10 and 13, which are based upon, or copied from, tho tables given ill Baird's Manual for Tidal Observations. I n Table 14 aro given F for the mean range of tidc,for I<, 0,,aud X, basedupon thofactors of Baird's manualand the nieari values of the coefficients as given in Darwin's roport (1883). Table 14, for reducing the meau range of tide, may be tested by means of the observed ranges a t Boston for tho years 1848 to 1565, Uuited States Coast Snrvey Report, 1868, page 81, Table VIII, last columrl; also a t n'ew York for the years 1856 to 1874, United States Coast Survey lieport, 1S73, page 198, Table V, eighth column. Tlie ratio (RI 0,)/hT2is about 0.2 a t Boston aud 0.3 a t Now York. 4!). Tllo following approximato relations will suffice for reducing reduutioti results to their mean values. In fact, a consideration of tho nature of these relations, together with tlie naturo of the 3"s of tho components, of Mn, El O,, and X, sliows that the left-hand part of these relations lies very near to its mean valuo when the quantities composil~g tlie right-hand part have their respective mean values. To reduce a quantity represented by tho left-hand part to its mean value, observe the corrospo~iding increase, say, in tho right-hand part end apply it to the given quantity, adding or multiplying as tho caw may be.

CHAPTER V.
ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF TIDES.

60. For places where coritinuous records of the tides have been obtained for any considerabIe lcngth of time, it is usually possible to ma,ko predictions ba,sed upon the analysis of snch observatioirs. But any tide table would soon become too bulky and expensive if predictions were to be given in detail for every place where forecasts are desired. I t therefore becomes inlportant to find a cla,ssification of tides, with the object of referring all stations having similar tides to one principal station where full predictions are given. The following<assumptions implied in the proposed classification hold true, as regards the principal compouents, for nearly every station where an analysis has been made:

First. Tho intervals of the

diurnal

components are approximately equal to one another a t

any particular station. Second. The amplitudes of the lunar Or "lar semidiurnal components bear approximately diurnal the same ratios to one another a t a11 stations. Granting the truth of these assumptions, the form of the tidal wave depends almost wholly upoll (a) The form of the wave composed of the tropic diurnal wave and the principal lunar semidiurnal component; that is, upon (KI 0,)/ M2 and M20 l C 1 O - OI0. (b) The ratio of tho amplitudes of the principal solar and lunar seniidiurnal component; that i8, upon 82/M2. (c) The form of the lunar semidiurnal wave; that is, upon M4/M2, 2 MzO Md0, M6/M2, 3 MzO Ma0, where, as is nearly always the case, M, and Ma are the principal harmonics of M2. Those quantities being equal a t two stations, the tides a t the one may be inferred. from those a t the other. Not only are tho times and heights of high and low water 6omparable, but also the height of the sea or tide a t any intermediate hour. When only high and low waters are to be 01)/M2 is a comcompared, the quantities in (c) need riot be alike a t both stations unless (K paratively large quantity; in which case the form of the lunar semidiurnal wave should be approximately tho same a t both stations. 51. If nonharmonic constants are used the quantities upon which the form of the tide wave depends are (a1) The ratios of the high and low water inequalities in height to the mean range of tide, together with the sequence of the four tides of a day; that is, upon HWQ/Mn, LWQ/Mn, and whetl~er the order of tlie tides is from higher high to lower low, or from lower low to higher high, the moon being far fro111 the equator. (bl) The ratio of the semime~lsualheight inequality to the mean range of tide; that is, , (Sg - Np)/2 Mn. (cl) The for111of the lunar seinidiurnsl wave. The quantities here selected for determining this are the durirtion of fall and tho heights of tbe sea referred to high arid low waters expressed in terms of the ineau range; that is, LWI- HWI, and heights of the sea or tide a t various liours before and after high and low water expressed in terms of Mn, wlien the range has its mean value. It will be observed that (a'), (bl), and (cl)are nearly equivalent to (a), (b), and (c), respectively, in fixing the form of the tide wave. Whenever the quantities in (a'), (bl), and (cl) are equal a t two stations tho tides are comparable throughout. If only high and low waters are to be com-

or LWQ/Mn pared, the quantities in (cl) need not to be alike a t both stations unless H W Q / M ~ is a comparatively large quantity; in which case the form of the lunar eemidiurnal wave should be approxi~nately the same :it both stations. A t stations where tlle tide is usllally diurnal the height illequalities are not easily determined. The form of tide rnay be deterlniued from the duration of tho (great) tropic range, together with the rise of tropic H H W and tho fit11 of tropic LLW reckoned from mean sea level. The amount of rise compared with the amount of fall sliows whether E W Q $ LWQ. 52. The sequence of the tides is deterrniued by the following rule : If the H W phase, i. e. 4 (M20- K1O- OI0),lie in the first or third quadrant, higher high precedes lower low; if in the second or fourth quadrant, higher high follows lower low. If twice the H W phase is used, it will lie in the first or secoud selnicircle according as higher high precedes or follows lower low. Having found that the tides a t two stations are comparable, the next step is to givo rules for referring the one to the other. The times.-The quantities which must be applied to the times of the tides a t tlle first station to obtain the timos of the tides a t the second station may be expressed thus: Difference for EIW= (HW),,- (HW),= (HWI),, - (HWI), 8,- S,, 1 3 % (L,,--L,)+ n (12"55"), TJifference for LW = (LWj,,- (LW), = (LWI),, - (LWI), S, - S,, + 1 & (I;,,- I;,) n ( 1 2 " Z P ) ;

+

+

+ +

(192)

where L,, L,, are the longitudes of the statio~lsarrd S,, S,, the longitudes of the time meridians, all expressed in time and reckoned westward from Greenwich. n (12" 2SN)is such a rnultiple of a half lunar day as will cause the diurnal iuequality a t the first station to properly reappear a t the second. A s the form of the tide wavo changes slowly from one day to another, n can be so take11 as to allow for the change in date which occurs in crossing the Pacific Ocean, a t the same time keeping tho tidal differences between the limits - lai125'" and + 121125m. When the tidal waves a t the two stations are of the same form, the time "difference for H W v is equal to tile "difference for LW;" in fact, all like phases of the tide a t the two stations are directly comparable by means of this time difference: The transit.-ltules for computing the high and low water establishmerits and for determining the sequence of the tides from harmonic constauts alone have already been given. The question which now arises is, To which transit must a liigh\~ater interval (whose value is nearer M20/28.98 than to M20/28.98 4 12'' 25'") be applied in order to obtain a higher high water wlien the moon's declination is south nOrt'll The answer is,

The 1beigibts.-If the planes of reference a t the two stations have the same definition with respect to tho tide, corresponding heights a t the two stations differ only by a constant factor. This factor is usually taken as the ratio of the mean ranges. Where evanescent tides frequently occur, the ratio of the (great) tropic ranges or of tho great diurnal ranges, should be used instead. If the planes of reference have different definitions a t the two stations, the heights a t one of the stations must bo properly reduced before applying the factor.

where D is the depression of the plane of reference below meau low water a t the principal station aud 0 the depression below mean low water a t the principal station of a plane there having the samo definition as the plane of reference a t the subordinate station. When the two stations are far apart, it mill generally be necessary to allow for the long period components if absolute heights of the tide are required. 54. Tides comparable by inversion. When the tide a t a subordinate station is similar to the one a t the principal station inverted,

HW a t the subordinate station is proportional t o the a t the principal station, the plane the LW of reference being mean sea level. To ascertain if such a comparison can be made, find the quantities in (a), (b), and (c). The procedure is as in the case of tides directly comparable, except that M20 - K1° - 010 and 2 M20- M,o should no longer have tho same values a t the two stations, but each should be 1800 greater or less a t the one station than a t the other.

This machine is now kept a t the South Kensington Museum. Tide predictor hTo. 2.-Tliis machine was designed by Mr. E. Itoberts and is now worked under his direction in preparirrg the " Tide tables for Indian ports." Tlle number of componeuts is twenty. Tide predictor No. 3.-This predictor, designed by Thomson, differs from No. 2 in the number of co~nponents, which is fifteell or sixtee11 instead of twenty, and in tlie direct character of the gearing. It was constructed in about 1SS1. Ge1tera.1 description.-Upoil one or niore shafts, driven by hand or by cloclr\rork, are fixed a number of wlieelv whicl~ mesh into other wheels, causing tlie latter (or wheels nroved by them) to revolve witli ;ingular velocities having g i \ ~ e ratios ~i to tho allgular velocities of the shafts. These ratios are taken, as nearly as possible, proportional to tlie speeds of particular tidal componellts. Rigidly connected to these wheels are cranks carrying pulleys, or pins working in slots, impa,rting to rods carrying pnlloys rectilinoal harmoriic motions. A t oire elid of the predictor a chain or flexible wire is made fast; thence it is laid alternately over aird under tho pulleys. To tJio free end of the wire is attached a markilig point, which when lnoved transversely to tho line of nrotiou of tho paper roll traces the tidal curve. This machine evidently sums tho series (213) or traces the curve (214). 58. Na.xima a)td minima tide-predicting machine. This machine, desigrled by the late Prof. VITilliam Ferrel, of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, was constructed in the years 1881-88. A description io given in the lteport for 1883, pages 253-378. Most of the predictions published by tlio Survey since 1885 have been made amplitude of tlie principal lunar upon it. The ni:tchino provides for llineteon componouts. T l ~ e component is introduced into the predictor by sliortening ono of the sulnmation chains about to be mentioned. Its argumeirt is indicated by a hand on the face of the machine making two revolutions for each lunar day. Generally spoalting, the speed ratios in tlie machine are not thoso of the colnpone~lts themselves, but are tlru differences between sucll ratios and the speod ratio of the principal lunar component. The srnaller short-period components are each provided with two cranks fixed a t riglit angles to each other, one for cosir~e terms and one for sille tarme. Each set of cranks carries pulleys, and the resultant eEects are obtained by means of two summation chains. One chaiu is mado to impart s vertical motion to a slotted horizontal strip of steel, while the other imparts a horizontal motion to a slotted vertical strip. These slots intersect a t the center of the machine when all short-period components are set a t zero amplitude. I n general, two settings of the ~nacl~ine are required, one for times and one for heights. When set for times, the direction of tlie intersection of the slots from the center of the machine shows (by aid of an oscillating needle) how the lunar hand must be directed a t the time of a high or low water. When set for heights tho distance of the intersection from the centari is, when multiplied by the cosiue of the angle between the lunar hand and the oscillating needle,$ the elevation or doprbssion of tho sea or tido frorn mean sea level. Tho machine gives tlie times of high and low wator directly; no tidal curve is traced, nor is any comput~tiou required. Approximate values of the heights are also given directly, but the determination of their exact values or of tlre height of tlie sea a t ally intermediate time requires a little additional labor, viz., the setting and reading of an extensible cosine scale. 59. A proposed tide predictor. The machine briefly described below will carry on simultanoonsly four operations, vie. : 1. The tracing of the tidal curve. 2. The marking upon the axis of tlie curve the times of the nlaxima and minima.

Tlie exhibiting upon the face of the machine the lieiglits of high aud low water, and the height of the sea a t any given time. (1) 111 regard to the accomplisl~me~it of tho first of these objects nothing further need be said, for a nieclia~~is~ll similar to that used in the Britisli macliiries seerns quite satisfactory. ( 2 ) Now let tliere be a set of cranks a t riglit angles to tlie set used in producing the title curve; for distinction the former may be called the time cranks and the latter height cranlis. Each set lias its resultant effect shown by the movement of the free end (or of a mark a constant distance therefrom) of a wire or slender chain. In each case the result might be sliown in tllo form of a contirruous curve. This, however, is not ordinarily wanted in t,he case of the time cranks. A projeotion upon the wire uniting their etfects comes illto contact with a pencil placed a t mean sea level, causing a short mark to be made every time high or low water occurs. (3) A mark on tlie wire a t a fixed distance from the projection just referred to pilsses before an opening in tlie face of the machine, and is so adjusted that when i t crosses a given line or mark tlle time sliown on the face is the time of high or low water according to the direction of the mire's movement. (4) The heights may be conveniently shown by mealis of ;L p o i ~ ~ t e moving r along a circular row of figures outside the tirile dial.

61. The prediction of tides, a s already stated, iinplies tlie combining of a series of waves i ~ r t o dne for the purpose of ascertuinirlg tlie lieight of the tide a,t a give11 tirne or of d e t c r ~ u i ~ i i ltlic ~g tilncs and heiglits of liigii and lorn water. 'rho computation of these qu:~ritities,mliile not difficult, is estrct~lely laborious; ou this account mechaniqal tide predictors have bee11 conatrnctetl. As these ilistrumunts are too ospcnsivo for general uso, a metliod is here proposed whereby predictions miby be made, witliout comput;ltion, fro111 tlie constants used ill settilig a ~nachine-in other words, from the harmonic tidal constants, tho initial equilibrium arguments, and certain factors ( f o f Tablo 10). The apparatus consists, first, of a sinooth board (about 3 by 4 feet), one section of mhicll is divided into twenty-fbur equal spaces, representing tho hours of the day; second, of a sot of pairs of movable curves, drawn once for a11 for a giver1 station, each pair provided with a "cale~idnr?) good for :ill ststiorls and all tilnu; a ~ i d third, of two stationary cleats for holding t h e curves in place, arid : L ~ l u l ~ l b of e r movablo cleats for i~itlices-one for each pair of curves. 62.

advantageous to use other than simple curves are 35, and S,, with their respective harmonics. Strictly speaking, the amplitude of the harnionics of M, vary faster on account of the change in the iliclination of the lunar orbit to the earth's equator than does tlie amplitude of M,; but 2 1 s , the amount of this change is small in srnall quantities, no great inaccuracy will be introduced by making the whole M wave vary as Mz varies. It is customary to put arg,,AZ= 2 argoAl arg, A, = 3 arg" Al . . . . . (239) a t the time t = 0, The above equation assumes that one has the valilc of the initla1 nrgu~nents local time, midnight, say. In practice i t is convenient to take the origin of time a t the instant of midnight 011 a certain standard time meridian, S, and to have the iuitial arguments made out for the n~eridian of Greenwich; then one might alter the arguments in such a may as to adapt them to the longitude of the locality, L, and to the standard time midnight. But if, instead of altering the Greenwich arguments, one alter the epochs by the same amounts, with opposite signs, thc same results will be attained and with the great advantage of being done once for all. The epocll of ally component A, thus modified is BpO =AVO+ (1Bp -ap) L + a,, ( L - S), = ApO+ 1 5 p L - apS (240) wherep is such an integer that 1 6 p is nearly equal to a,. When A, denotes a diurnal component, then p = l , 2 , according as A, is diurnal, semidiurnal, etc. 63. Construction o f a height curve.-For convenience in drawing the curve, suppose argoA, to be zero; then its equation with modified epochs becomes

. . .

y = A, cos (a,t - 8,O)

+ A, cos (2 al t - PlzO) + A3 COB (3alt - ?I30)+ . . . .

(241)

The position of the maxima of A, are given by the equation

where n is zero or a positive or negative integer.

A t this time the phases of the harmonics are

.

,

. ,

(243)

while the positions of their respective maxima are given by the equations

The beginning of the curve should be glo degrees or YLlo/al hours before the flrst maximum.

It should extend over a trifle more than two or three days according as A1 is a semidiurnal or a
diurnal component. From the beginning and along the axis, generally lay off two periods, leaving the first blank and dividing the second into degrees from zero to 360. The number equivalent to arg, Al when brought over the stationary zero hour line fixes the position of the curve for the day. Conrrtruction o f a time curve.-The equation of the derived curve corresponding to (241) is

I t will be noticed that the descending ascending nodes of the derived curve will coincide in time with the maxima of the height curve. This is of course equally true for each clement or component of minima the curve. I n ascertaining the magnitude of the coe8Bcients A1al, 2 A, a,, 3 A, a, relative to i t is usually convenient to take the speed of Mza8 unity, expressing other A,, Az, A3, speeds in term of this unit. The derived curvo is used in ascertaining the times of tide, and is drawn in a broken line upon the movable strip upon which the height curve has already been drawn. Construction o f a "calendar."-It will now be supposed that arg, Ap ie given for only one day of each year, January 1. The change in the given arg, A, necessary to adapt i t to any other

d;ty of the yoar may be assumed to be uniform, and tho same for all years. This change is introduced by means of a Lccalendar peculiar to the component and its harmonics. Anywhere a t tho left of the curves, a soction of the strip one period in length is set apart for the days of the year. The positious of the datov are given by Table 4. Jauuary 1 will be located a t the right or left edgo of the period according as the speed of the component is less or greater than that of the solar component of approximately the same speed. It is sornotirnes more convenient to set apart two or more periods for the calendar. This will necessitate two or more blank periods of the curve, instead of one, before the period used in laying down arg, A,. This means, of course, an increase in the length of the curve. Lunar nodal components, etc.-In order to avoid numerous smell components, especially those dependent upon the longitude of the moon's node, the lunar tides are made to undergo small changes in argument which are not directly proportional to tlle time, and also small cha~iges of amplitude. The former have bee11 :iccountecl fbr in Tablo 3 by the u of V,, u,or arg,, where u llns an irregular variation, but so slow that for the purpose of prediction it may bo regarded as constaut during a year. The variations of amplitude aro givorl by the f 7 s of Table 10, and can be sllown upon the curves by me:tris of a scale of proportional parts of the mean values of the anlplitude anti ordinates of each component. But as tliof's vary quite uniforrnly with I (the inclination of the lunar orbit to to mark upon certain ordinates of the curve the equator, Tables 1anci 13) it is generally sufiicie~it their increased or decreased values corresponding to changes in I. The time scale.-This scalo consists of twenty-five equidistant lines driiwn upon the statiouary board underneath all of tho curves. Tile strips up011which tho curves are drawn should be separated from one another by liarrow spaces, so that the time scale, or rather the hour lines, may be aeon between them. 64. Directions for predicting. Find in Table 3 the value of V,, + u of each component for the givon year and bring this number of the degree scalo over tho zero hour line. Set tho vibrious indices over tho date J a w ary 1. For any other day move the scales until tho indices, as already set, come over the required date upon each scale. Suppose, in the first instance, that the height of tho sea or tido is required a t any particular hour of this day. Alol~g tlio edge of a pioce of papor mado hcoincide with the given hour line,mark the positive ordinates of the full curvAs (slightly modified to account for the varying obliquity of the noon's orbit to the equator) 80 that a11 such ordinates shall be added together. Alo~ig the same edge, but on the opposite surface of the paper, mark tho negative ordinates, beginning a t tho heiglit upon tho paper slip reached by tho positivo ordinates and going in an opposite direction. Tho resulting difference is the height of tho tide above or below mean aea love1 a t the stated hour. If a lower plane of reference bo preferred, its depression below mean sea level should be laid off upon the paper slip beforo marking tho ordinates up011 it. To $nd the time o f high or lozo ?cater.--By glancing a t the dotted curves of the principal comporients one can usually tell roughly whero the algebraic sum of their ordiuates approach select a desconding node; if a low wator, an aucendil~g. zero. If a high water timo is sougl~t, A t two adjacent hours near the high or low wator, lay ott'upon a slip of paper the positive and negative ordinates of the dotted curves, properly modified for the varying obliquity of the moon's orbit to the equator. . Now take any scale about three hours in length, divided to single minutes. From this lay off e tlie two the two resulting heights, olio liour apart. A straightedge will show where a l i ~ i joining points just laid down will cut the tinlo scale. The time thus determined is the time of high or low water with reference to either hour line. 65. It i~ obvious that the foregoing method is applicable to periodic phenomena, altliough the constituent periodic curves may have no reaenlblauco to simple c o s i ~ ~ curves. e Such curvos are constructed by means of conlponent hourly ordinates obtained fiaonl t,he observations. These remarks have special referonce to the prediction of tidal currents.

The "Ephemeris" and the sheet following it indicate the work preparatory to making predictions. The process of prediction indicated below consists of three steps, the deterrninstion of the semidiurnal wave,of the diurnal, and of combining the two thus determined. Port Townseud, Washmgton, is taken as an illustration because of its large diurnal components.

If r denote the speed of any given component C, then a component whose speed is

has with C a synodic period n hours in length. If C be the principal one of the two components, then the effect of the other is to introduce an inequality into Cof a period equal to n. The known motions of the moon and sun suggest what tidal inequali ties may exist corresponding to periodic irregularities in the motions of these bodies, or in the motions of the elements of their orbits. The following tabulation shows that it is often necessary to use more than one component to account for what may be regarded as an irregularity in the principal component :

I

This table, based upon Tables I and 21, is computed upon the assumption that the ratios between the diurnal components, the pure lunar semidiurnals, the solar semidiurnals (including luni-solar Kg), are respectively constant for all stations; also that shallow water tides do not occur. On account of nonpredictable inequalities, the tabular values should be multiplied by about I.oa.

This table is Table 22 reverted. On account of nonpredictable inequalities, the tabular values should be divided by about roz.

The instrument sliop i~ I\, repttir and experimental shop, and the construction of 1iew inst,rumerits is iricidental to this work, being mostly confilled to such instrument8 as lnay be required

for e s l ) c r i ~ i i e or ~ ~ inay t be suggested by the experience of the field parties, tlie cor~struction of wl~icliinvolves a coiividernble slnolil1t of experimental work nnd persoi~al supervision. Sl~ch i~istruir~ents are ofteu evolutions and their construction would not be u~ldertnkenby private or co~umercial sliops except a t n 111uch greeter cost to the Survoy. In order to secure the best results, the Superintendent, in October, 1890, appointed :In advisory board 011 instruinelits arid their construct~on, con~isting of tlie following officers: Assistants C. A. Schott, R. 5 . Woodward, 0. H. Tittmann, Audrem Braid, Edwin Smith, E. I). I'reston, and tl~c chief instrume~itmaker, Mr. E. G . Fischer. The Chief of tho Instrulneut Division acted : l s chsirman. Since that date all i~liportantmatters referring to instruments l ~ a v e been considercbd by this board, :wd as reg:br(ls new instruments its e i n ~ has been to make them as perfect as possible, taking advantage of tlie experience of all surveys in this as well as foreign countries. The Survey is f o r t u ~ ~ i~ n t having a a ~rcll-equippedshop and several excellent i i i s t r u ~ n e ~ ~ t mslrera. To the chief instr~iri~e~it milker especial credit is due for excellent deagns and mtitly valuable rnechanicd suggestions. The iiistruments briefly described in this paper are some that have been co~~stl-ucted sii1c.o 1890. Descriptions of others will be found in other reports, the pendulurna iu report of 1891, the Holton base apparatus in report of 1892, etc.
TWO 30'5"" (12-INCH) POSITION THEODOLITES, NOS. 145 AND 146, MADE IN THE INSTRUMENT DIVISION OF THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVBY OFFICE, 1890-1893. SEE PLATE I.

These numl>ers(145 arid 146) belonged to two theodolites that had been in the poseession of the Survey for several years, but had not proved sa.tisfactory. An attempt was made to remodel them As the work progressed various difficulties were enconntered, nnd the result was the construction of two instruments entirely new except tlie circles. The two old circles had been cast fro111differe~ll p:itterns,'aiid when they had been turi~etlow, regribdunted, and mounted upon tlle instrnments, i t wsv di~coveredthaG the circle of No. 146 mas weak n,nd had sprurtg when twliott off the cllucli.

The two ilistrulnents are now as nearly alike as it is practicable to make tlleln. Thc followi~lg description will apply to both: The base is of cast iron, into the socliet of mliich is fitted another cast-iron socket, to wl~icll is rigidly attached the brass circle ant1 illto which is fitted the center which carries the alidade. Under the circle is a devico for firmly clamping 'this socket to the base in any position of tlie circle. The, center is 22.2cm (8 inches) long, its two beariug surfaces being cones of diffbrent angles. I t is made of the best quality of tool steel, and the cones are made glass hard. No pains were sl)arecl in tho constructior~ of these centers and sockets, and i t is believed they are tho most perfect ever made for theodolites, and are probably the first theodolite centers with glass-ha.rd bearirig surfaces. In the alidade the cover of the circle, the supports for the micrometer microscopes, the wye supports, axis, and setting circle of telescope are made of aluminurn. The bearing surfaces of the wyes are of brass, and the pivots of telescope axis are of bell metal. The draw tube of telescope, micrometer microscopes, clalnps, :uiti other small parts are of brass. Tlie use of slurninurn in the constructio~lof these itistruments was not with tlie special pnrpose of reducing the total weight of the instrument, but to reduce the weight supported upon the centers. The cast-iron bases of these instrumeuts, in proportiori to the wliole mass of tlie instruments, are niuch heavier than is usual ill other theodolites of the same size. These heavy bases and long centers give great stability to the instruments. The weight of the wl~ole alidade is 7.6 kilogramnies (17 pounds), whereasin other instruments of the same size that have been used in tlie Survey the weight, of similar parts is 18 kilogrammes (40 pounds). The centers of tlie oltl instruments are of various forms, and the frictiori is so great tliat it has to be relieved by some device a t lower elid of centers. No such device is necessary with the new instrumellts. The total weight of one of the new irlstrunlents is 18.5 kilograrnmes (41 pounds). The telescope objective was made by J. Brashear, and ifi (i.lctl1 (2.4 inches) aperture, and 73.'icm (29 inches) focus. The telescope has a11 ocular micrometer, with three Ramsden eyepieces, givilig powers of 30,45, ;md 60. Several levels, all made by A. Pesseler, of Germany, are attached to tho alidade for convenience. The stride level has divicrior~s of 2mn1, wit% arc value of 4". The graduation. of the circle is on coin silver and is 30.5cn1(12 inches) in diameter. It is divided to 5' and reads to seconds by three equidistant micronleter microscopes. Each degree of the graduation is numbered. The degrees and w lea rest 5 / are read by a low-power index microscope 500 to the right of micrometer microscope A. Attached to the cover of the circle is a small camel'shair brusli which sweeps over the graduation. The circles mere graduated 011 the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey engine. This graduating engino was originally mado by Troughton Sr; Simms, of Londou, and bears the date of 1841. In the hands of the Survey i t has received v a r i o ~ ~ improvements, s the chief of which are a new tracing apparatus and new support for the same. The engine is driven by a small turbine wheel uporl which a constant water pressure is maintained. To graduate a circle to 5' takes about 3" 3.7". The graduations are made a t a temperature of 36o.GG 0.(980 F.),that temperature being most easily maintained a t any season of tlie year and least affected by the occasional presence of the operator. For tlie last nine yea,rs this engine has been manipulated exclusively by tho present chief instrument inaker of the Survey and in his harids has produced some very fine gradu;ttions, as the results with the two new theodolites, Nos. 145 and 146, s11ow. I n April and May of 1893 a critical examination of these tlleodolites mas made by Assistant It. S. Woodward under iristruction from the Superintendent of the Survey. He has submitted orlly a preliminary report, from which the following is taken: "This examination has special reference to the perfection of the horizontal circles of the instruments, and was conducted in accordance with the following plan submitted to you in Iny letter of March 31, 1893. It is here restated as there given, in order that the l i n e along which the inquiry proceeded may be clea,rly apparent. (1) In order to determillo the value of a space on the horizontal circle, which space may be used as a standard space, it will be essential to compare ~ u c h space with a large number of other &pacessituated a t equidistant intervals about the circle. The a,verage value of this large number

of sl)ac:ea luny be assurned to be the nominal value, wlierice the standard space will become kno~vn,. ;~nd it niay tlier~be used for determining error of runs of micrometers. This process will also give tlie errors of all Sl)aCeR observed, and thus afford a good general test of the equality of the spaces. (2) We Inay then pass to an cxa~ninntionof tho inequality of the arcs covered by the dist:t~lcobetween consecutive ~iiicroscopes. By observirig tl~eseinequalities for a large number of i11.c~ sy~lnmetrically disposed about t l ~ u entire c~rcle the harmonic series expressing the divergelice ti,r :uiy :~rc may be computed. A cornparison of the computed and observed values of such divergencies will reveal any consitlerable accidental errors. L L (3) 13y far the most important class of errors affecting circles of yrecisiori are the periodic in the sun1 (or.meau) of the equidistant lilicroscopo readings. These errors errors not climi~iated atfect measured'angles, while the periodic errors mentioned under (2) above do not. To determine tile harhonic expression for this unore important class of errors tlie best metllod appears to be to observe as carefully as practicable a series of angles which will produce the lnavimum eflect, respectively, from the several torms ot' tlie series. Sucli nleasures mill euable us tr, coulpute the a~i~plitucle~ :i11(1 the phase angles of tlie several harmonic ternis, and thus give ;i formula for tlie correctio~i to ally measured angle, whatever its size and whatever the part of tho circle on which i t may bo observed. ;LUefbro giving an abstract of the results of the examination it appears proper to mske solno st;~teu~ents with reference to the general fo:itures of t8hesei~istrumeuts and the degree of mechanic;~l~)el.fection shown by them. Having ex:imiricd amnuniber of eimilar itlstrumerits made by Troiiglito~i & Simms, the ltepsolds, Pistor 6 :Martins, and Fantli & Co., it has bee11 easy to judge of tlio relative merite of tlio new t~lieotlolites. f i With respect to design slid perfection of mechanical construction, these riew theodolites must, I tl~ink, take rar~lr ~ r i t , tlio l ~ liigliest of tlioir class. In equality of spacing of consecutive gradu:ttion lines and in t l ~ uniformity c of width and aspect of tl~ese li~les the circles of the instruments appear to be superior to :ill circles I havo exarililled under an equal magnifying power. '6 Witli respect to their capacity for rr~easuri~ig horizontal angles, repeated trials show that they are a t Icnst equal to tlie best iustruments made elsewhere. It appears, in fact, that, so far 2 1 s purely instrume~ital and observationi~l errors are co~~cerued, a mean measured anglo from four equidiutaut positioris of tlie circle of either instru~lieut will havo a precision equal to the requirements of the highest order of primary triangulation. "Concerning the lightness of the instruments, whicli is a nov.el feature, i t appears to me quite satisfactory. Without assistance an observer can tali0 oiie of them from its case aricl p1;~ce it on a pier or stand with perfect safety; arid this is often a matter of ocoriolny and great convonie~ice. On tho other hand, the small niass of tho ilivtrun~entsmay not be satisfactory to some observers. After usirlg heavier instruments of tlie same class (like those made by Troughton & Simms, for example) ale's Arst improssion is that tho new theodolitos are lacking in rigidity. This is lnost ~~oticeable ill the micrometer arms, whicli are quito se~isitive to lateral stress. I t does riot appear, however, that this lwlc of rigidity cau bo sensibly detrimental, especially wit11 observers who understand their work. If any disadvantage result therefrom, it is, in my opinion, more thall offset by the advanta,ge coming from the lightness. "There is ono noticeable defect of theodolite No. 146. I t lies in dep,axtures of the graduakd surface of its circle from a conical sui.f~ce. These departures, though small, are large enough to require diflerent focal adjustmonts of the particular microscope used 011 diflere~itparts of the circle in order to secure satisfactory freedom from parallax. Nevertheless, when the microsco~)es are adjusted for the average distauce of the circle from them, tlie ed'ect of parallax does rlot appear to be sensible in measured angles. The defect manifests itself then only by iudistiuct visiou on sorne parts of the circle. " IVitli respect to tlie clamp and tangent for the alidado and tho movement of the latter about its axis, the performance of the instrulnerit is very satisfactory. Tho great length of the :didado axis undoubtedly givos precision and stability to the motion of tlie microscopes. The projectio~iof the socket of this axis below tho plane of the foot screws would be courited an objoctiori by some, but if a real objection i t appears to be of little weight.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC: SURVEY.

Spacing of consecutive graduation marks.-In accordauce with sectiou (1)of tlie plan outli~red a.bove, a largo number of spaces were measured by means of the micrometers on each circle. Tlle results have been compnted for theodolite No. 146 only; and i t may be doubted wl~etl~er those for No. 146 are pi-operly trustworthy, since they involve errors due to parallax which may equal or ever1 aurpass those of spacing. The observations on the spacing of No. 145 were ~uatie by Assista ~ l Sinclair. t Each space of a group of equidistant spaces on the circle' was measured with the lnicronleter fonr times independently; and a t intervals during the measures of these spaces several similar determinations mere made of the assumed standard space. This latter is the space 50005l fo 600101. The data thus obtained give the latter space in t e r ~ n of s tho average value of all the spaces of the group. Four such groups ot measures were made. Tlie results are given in the tables below. The position of any space is defined by tho index reading of n~icroscope A, with which the measures mere made. In all cases the space referred to is that between the 5/ and 10' marks, these being chose11because they are of tho same length and thus present the same aspect to the observer.

"Thus it appears that the average error of spacing of the spaces examined is 0.20 div., or but 0.16 microns. This indicates a degree of precision in spacing of a very high order. In this respect the graduation must be regarded as practically perfect. Attention may be called to tlie progressive iricrease in the Rums of the measured spaces when taken by quadrants or by semicircles. This is quite large in the ca;se of the observations of April 5, but tlie subseqnent observations are less consistent on this point.

L b Inequulity o f arcs comprised between consecutive microscopes.-Sevoral series of measures of the distar~cebetween a pair of microscopes wore made on the oquidist;tnt arcs with excl~instrument. Tlie followiirg results will suflice to show what is tlevoloped by this test. Suppose A and B denote the readings of tlie ~nicroscopes1i:wing tho same designatiol~011 any part of the circle; the difference, (B-,A) will involve the escess of t,he distance betmeell these microscopes over the nominal distance, or 1200.

"Oonsidering the above group means as so many measures of the several angles to which they refer, respectively, i t appears that the probable error of one such mean, or the probable error of the mean angle from four positions of the circlo, is 4OU.28. This error is the resultant of all sources of error which affect such measures, namely, periodic and accidental errors of graduation, errors of observation, errors due to unstaadiness of the atmosphere (which was riot exc:eptionally favorable during the period covered by the observations), etc. It is evident, therefore, that the periodic and accidental errors not eliminated in the mean result fro111 four positions of the circle are very small. "The range amongst the individual measures of a n o u p risos at most to 6", and sillce the angles measured were selectad with a view t o developing this range, i t is probable that this represents tho maximum range, due to periodic errors, which one may expect to find in augles measured with these instruments. "The results of this test are, tllen, very favorable to the instruments and show that they are fully oqual in their capacity to the best instruments hitherto mado." After the new circle mas made for No. 146 there was no time for a critical examination of i t before it was sent to the field. A partial examination made in the Instrument Division brought out the same characteristics as were found by Assistant Woodward for No. 145. The two instruments were sent to the field in the summer of the present year (1894). No. 145 was used a t station Bison by Assistant F. W. Perkinu and No. 146 a t ,Mount Elbert by Assistant P. A.

The detailed results do not show eitlier flexure or disturbance of instrument. The iridividual results in the tablo depend upon a t least eight pointings on each sigual, and the angle between each sigllal and the mark is ~neasured by six symmetrical arcs on the circle. The ~~esultiug meau of each group of on eacli signal, and the angle between four positions depends upon a t least thirty-two poil~titigs e,wh signal and the mark is measured by twenty-four symmetrical arcs on tlte circle.

Tllc probable error of au angle from the mark from thc rncall of a group of four positious is 4- 0".18 and frorn the mean of tho four groups of four positions is 4 0"-08. Tlie grcatest deviatton of any individual result in the table from the lneall of the sixteen positions is l'I.93 ill Positiou IV, angle 4 . A t this station the sigrtals were distant as follows: Pikes Peak, 59 kilometres (36.0 ~niles); Ouray, 110.5 kilonietres (G8.J miles); Elbert, 83 kilolnetrea (514 ~niles), and Divide, 87 kilometres (54.1 miles).

The socket carries the alidade. The only alnrninum used in this instrument is the cover to the circle. The diameter of the graduation is 20.3Cn1(8 inches). It is divided to 10' and read to 211 by two micrometer microscopes. The heads of the micrometers are divided into 60 part&and numbered as follows: 0, 10, 20, 0, 10, 20. One revolution of the screw is 2/, and oue division of tlie head is 311. I n the micrometer, in place of the usual rack, is a glass scale, 10 parts of which correspond to a space of 10' on the circle and to 5 revolutions of the micrometer screw. The micrometar slide carries double wires. The micrometer reads 0 when the right-hand wire of double wires is on middle line of glass scale and the head of screw is a t 0. Degrees end minutes are read directly in the microscope. The readings of tho micrometer heads should be recorded as divisions. The

FORMULA3 AND TABLES POR THE: COMPUTATION O F GEO1)ETIC POSITIONS.
[Fo~lrthedition.]

The first edition of these formulm and tables was published as Appendix No. 36, Coast Survey Report for 1860, under tho titlo u F o r m u l ~tables, , arid oxarnple for the geodetic computation of latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths of trigonometrical points, as used in the United States Coast Survey." Tlie tables were first computed by Assistant Th. W. Werner in 1847, and were used in manuscript form up to 18G0, aud a t later dates tllcy were extended in range of latitude in order of tho Survey. They aro based upon the formula for the computation to satisfy further tie~nands of geodetic positions as developed by l'uissaot, and their derivation will be found in Volume I, Chapter SV,of his Treatise on Geodesy.' These formula, were adapted in 1846 to the use of the Coast Survey by Assistant J. E. Hilgard (superintendent during 1881-85), who added an intermediate term to-tho expression for difference of latitude lo reuder i t more accurate, and provided for the table of factors to facilitate the oomputation of goodetic positions. The spheroid of reference upon the surface of which the triangulations of tho Survey were supposed to be developed was that derived by Bessel and published in the ~stronomischc Nachrichten, No. 438 (December, 1841). The secol~d edition of the tables is contrtinetl in Coast Survey Report for 1875, Appendix No. 10. Tlie derivation of t l ~ u toruiu1:e is there given and the tables are extended froni latitude 500 to latitude 630; it contains, besides, two auxiliary tables to facilitate computations when changing tho reference splieroid from that of Bessul to that of Clarke (1866). However, it was not till February 4,1880, that Superintendent Patterson ordered the substitution of the latter spheroid for t,he Besselian, which latter had been in use on the Survey since the year 1844.t This charlgo necessitated tlio issub of tho third edition ill Coast anti Geodetic Survey Report for 1884, Appendix No. 7. 'rho text was reprinted and the table given in connection with the computation o f the spherical excess appeared extouded ill latitude. The present edition differs from tho preceding one by the introduction of a change in the notation of the formula, substituting for the older form one in better accord with modern custom, and, further, by au extension of the tables so us to take ill the highest latitude of United States territory, bekides 50 added to the former southernmost limit.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The linear dimensions of Bessel's spheroid were originally expressed in toises. Their metric equivalents as generally adopted are given below. The dimensions of Clarke's spheroid (of 1866) are stated by him in feet, toises, and metres. (See Appendix to Comparisons of the Standards of Length, etc., by Capt. A. 32. CIarke, under the direction of 001. Sir H. James, etc., London, 1866, page 287.) The dimensions in metres are:
According to Bessel According to Clarke (1866). (1841).

Equatorial semi-axis = a Polar semi-axis = b

6 377 397'2 6 356 079'0

6 378 206.4 6 356 583'8 293'98 294'98

298.15 299'15

Strictly speaking, the latte; dimensions, to be expressed, as they must be, in terms of the prototype metre, should be slightly changed, for the reason that Clarke's results depend primarily on the yard and the relation of the yard and metre as found by him, 1yard = 0.914 391 80" (or 1 foot = 0.304 797 27"),* should now be changed to conform to the more correct relation,+ viz: 1 foot = 0.304 800 61m, or 1 metre = 3.280 833 3 feet; the diff'erence, however, is unimportant, since either spheroid might have been adopted, and it would be inexpedient to recompute the tables of factors. Among later determinations of spheroids representing the earth% figure, and apart fkom several published by Colonel Clarke, we may mention two of very different derivation, viz: Prof. W. Harkness, U. S. N., in his L L The Solar Parallax and its Related Constants, Washington, D. C., 1891," reached the following result, vie: Xquatorial semidiameter, G 377 972 4 125 metres; a-b1 . - 300.2k3,0; P. Tisserand, in his 6 L Trait6 polar semidiameter, 6 356 727 99 metres, and

--

de Mechanique CBleste, Tome 11, Paris, 1891," states that the aplatissement (flattening) could not provided the earth7sdensity increises continuously from surface o ' center be greater than m 3 and the shape of the surface is due to original fluidity. A new value for this representative figure of the geoid, more reliable than any yet deduced, may be expected to result from the labors of the International Geodetic Association for the measurement of arcs, particularly since arcs of the parallel can no longer be regarded as so far inferior in value to arcs of the meridian as to exclude them from combination with the latter, both however being seriously influenced by local deflections of the vertical. Arc measures in a country, if of sumcient extent, may be utilized for deducing or choosing a special spheroid adapted to its surface, as was, for instance, the case with the Clarke spheroid, which is supposed to conform better to the compact area of the United States than the one previously in use. In what follows, the derivation of the formula and the arrangement for the computation of geodetic positions, as given by Assistant J. E. Hilgard, have been reproduced from the preceding edition, after changing the notation as mentioned above. C. A. SUHOTT, Assistant. DECEXBER, 1894.

AZIiVlUTHS.

When the geographical coordinates of latitude and longitude of a point on the earth's surface and the distance and azimuth to another point are known, the problem of computing'the latitude and longitude of the second point and the reverse azimuth may be treated in two different ways. We may either solve the spheroidal triangle formed by the two points and the pole, as a whole, arriving a t trigonometricd functions of the required co-latitude, azimuth, anddifference of longitude, or we may develop expressions Ibr the differences of the required and the given quantities. The former or direct method has the inconvenience of requiring the use of ten places of deci. mals in the computation, in order to give the positions with a degree of exactness corresponding to that of the known distance between the two points, while the second leads to very convenient expressions, on account of the smallness of the differential arcs in ordinary triangulation. When, however, the arc between the two points reaches several degrees in length, the direct method must be resorted to. This solution has been very completely and elegantly effected by Beseel, and is given in Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 86,1826. Adopting the second method, we follow in the main Puissant (Trait6 de CBod6sie)* in the development of the difference of latitude of two points on the spheroid in terms of the distance, azimuth, and latitude of the given point. It will be desirable first to recall the expressions of several lilies of an ellipse in terms involving the latitude p which is the angle the normal to any point on the ellipse makes with the major axis.

The radius of curvature R and the normal N are principal quantities used in geodesy. I t will be observed that radii of curvature for different latitudes do not intersect unless prodnced, and that when they Lie in d3erent meridional planes on the spheroid they will not intersect a t all.

Fig 2.
A and B in fig. 2 are two points on a spheroid of revolution, having the latitudes 9,cpt, and joined by tho geodetic line AB = 8, making the angles with the meridian PAB = 1800 - a,and PBA = a' - 1800. The azimuths a, a' are reckoned from south around by west in consequence of the latitudes being reckoned, by settled custom, from the equator toward the poles, otherwise the lneridional coordinate of a point would be more properly measured from the pole and the azimuth of a line reckoned from the north. The angle A P B between the two meridional planes passing through A and B is the difference of their longitudes A, hi, which being reckoned positive to the westward we have ht h = Ah. Furthermore, An, Bn', Ar, Br' indicate the normals N,N', and the radii of curvature in the meridian R, R ' ,a t the points A and B. This being premised and the latitude q of the point A being given, as well as the length s of the geodetio line AB and its azimuth a, we propose to and the latitude gr' of the point B, the angle

Observing now that a is always n small arc, rarely exceeding 10, and generally less tlinn 301, me can develop the increment of y with reference to that of o in a rapidly converging eeries, and will have, by Taylor's theorem, . In ort'ler to determine the differential coeffioients, we consider a differential spherical triaugle having the sides y , da, and J / dy, i11 which cos ( y d y ) = cos y cos d a + sin y sin da cos El

A convenient table for finding the reciprocal of cos 4 (AT) is appended.

The inverse problem.-Cases frequently occur where the distance and mutual azimuths are demanded of two points whose latitudes and longitudes orlly are known. It has not been found necessary to prepare special formulx and blank forms for this cornputfation, as i t can readily be ' by made with the help of the preceding forms, It is done by dividing RA = 8 sin a .

Thls would give the azimuth a t once, provided we knew h, since dA is given. We therefore compute the smaller terms for the difference of latitude in order to obtain 1~by subtracting them from the known value of dp. The only addition to the usual form is the term log. tan a = log (s sin a ) log (s cos a). The value of 8 will best be taken from the term h when sin a exceeds cos a, end from tlie term Ah when the reverse is the case. When the distance 8 is large, as in primary triangulation, it will be necessary to introduce the correction for dA due to diflerence of ratio between sine and arc, using the form for primary work, inversely, as indicated above.

INTRODUUTION, AND E X P L A N A T I O N O F THE TABLIS O F I'OSITIONS.

Tlre geographic positions in the Stato of Massacllusetts l~eremith groserlted were determined
by the Ullited States Coltst a11d Geodetic Survey between the years IS43 :ln(l 18!)4, and i~lclr~do the work of' the Bortlen Sarvey of the years 1532 to 1838. A first, edition was pnblished by t l ~ e

Survey as Ap1)eltdis Xo. 8, lieport fbr 1885, which colltailloil tllo results reached to the e~lrlof that year.* 111 tile present second edition, el~largecinncl revised, the latest observations mi~dc si~ice1885 and i l l conuection with the Jfassaohusetts State survey, itro ilrcorpor;ited. Prior to, ~~~ c~lga~ged ~ott~ up011 a trigorlometric survey of during, and after 1890 tlie State of ~ l i t ~ ~ ; t c lwas its townslli~) bourldaries mliicl~is based 011 tho sta~lclard data of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Tlle I<orden, the Coast and Geodetic, mid the 31assachuset.ts State surveys, being based on tho form n systematic ml~olc. After 1890 the cooper;ition of tlie Coast same st:ax~dnrclgeodetic di~ta, and Geoiletic Survey with tho Msssilchusetts State survey ceased. This addition to the fieldwork ~lecewsitated in many cases :I. re:rdjastrnerlt or nr, additional a(ljnst4uent of part of tlie secondary aud tertiary trinngulntions, due to relneasuros of old a11g10sor Ineasiires of new ones, in order to co~npleto fornler ~ ~ ~ figuros. itli 1 1 1 tliost cases the renctioli on the results of positiolls already publislled was s~nnll: and within the litnits of nccnrilc!y assigned to them in tlie preface to tho first editiou. All results depenil on the standard geodetic data of the Snrroy, arid i11 particular on the clat:t aciopted f o tlie ~ Atlantic Coast; they are given below. Unit of' length.-The unit of lengtl~now aciopted 011 tho Survey is the i~~ternatioual metre,+ or, in this country, sillco January 2, 1890, its represontativo, tho national prototype metre No. 27; fortunately, t,he length of the corn~nittee metre, standarded in France in 1799 and brought to tlie IJ11ited States in 1805 by tho first Suporintendent of tho Survey, altd used hero up to tho tinlo of the rtcto1)tion of tlie nat.ionn1 prototype metre, mas fouuil to be so nearly equal to the,lengtli of tlie latter $ that none but tho no st refirled results of the Survey monld netxi a slnall correction. Tl~o change produces IIO sensible effect upon the results hero preser~ted.

T l ~ e 13esseli:ui splleroid wliich had been nsed for s o ~ n e time on tlle Survey,l)rior to 1880 was fouriti to bc too s111a11 for our middle latitudes. Tlie clilnensions of tlie Clarke'splleroid of' 1SCiG are a s fbllo~vs: a = G.804 G9S 57 a = Equatoi-ial semidiarnetcr,* G 37s BOG-4 metres G 350 583.S metres b = 0 3 223 78 b = I'olar semi-asis, a : b = 294.98 : 293.08

Tlce standard latittcde is tliat of the primary triangulation along the A t l a ~ ~ t i Coast, c viz: Prillcipio station, (p,, = 390 33' 3G."G93 (see Appendix Yo. S, 1tcl)ort for ld79). Tlte stn?ldal.tl longittide is t h a t resultirlg fro111 the adjusted telegraphic lollgitutlo syst.e~n wl~ich connects directly witli Greenrvich a s the initial or zero nieridian.

TIce s t n n d a ~ d azir~zuth is that of the primary triangulation, viz: l'rincipio to Turltey station ( Y , = 10 34' 3G-11413 (see Appendis No. S, IZeport for 1879). Tile older pub1ic:atiolis by this Office of geographic positions iii Appendix Xo. 12, Rcport,for 1831, Appendix No. 15, lteport for 1864, and Appendix No. 13, Iteport for lSGS, are tl~erefore superseded ;is based upon a different spheroid a s well a s upon differeut standart1 d a t a from t l ~ o s e 1)ccn sill),jected to tliorougli acl~justnient. All of tlle results now in nse. Nor 11ad tlle old ~e..iults pnblislied in tlre report of 1885 are re1)roduced here, iluproved or corrected w11t.n iiecess:lry, aud to those 1504 liem positions are added.t ltespecting elevations of stations above the lialf tide or average sea level, the Survey i s not a t present in a contlition to furnish them accnrately. Copies of descriptions of stations, how marked on t l ~ e surface and below ground, can generally be given on apldicatio~ito tlie Survey Office. The additional worlt of triarigulation done in and since tlie year 1885 was for tlie 111ost part confined to tho e:istern ~ e c t i o nof the State, b u t owing to its minnteness demanded ti larger scale p r ~ ~ j e c t i o to ~ i clearly distinguisli it tllau was requiratl for the precedi~lgedition. Two of the accom1)anying triariguliltion sketches $ are on tlie scale of 1 :I50 000. The first contains tlio region about Cape Cod, t h e second that of Cape Ann, wliile t l ~ e third sketch, on :I scalo of 1:300 000, is a copy from the former l)ublic:~tioii,aud comprises the middle alld weatern part of the Ststc. Tlle 1)ositions arld connecting lines of all adjustccl stations are shown on these maps. A11 less important points, or in regions where milch crowded, a r e simply shomli by dots. Tlle results of the corr11)utationof the primary triangulation are contained in Appendix KO. 21, lteport for 1865, from whic.ii article tlie le?igtlrsof the triangle ~idetl upon which the survey in Massacliusetts depends have been taken. I n a geueral way and sullicient for illustrution me may explain t h e process of co~nputing and of prodncing systern:ttic results a s follows: The position of t h a t particular trigonometrical station most strongly with t h e maill triangulation is first fixed by adjustment, taking which i s co~inected into coilsideration the lines directed t o i t from primary stations a s well a s lines diverging from i t and intersecting t h e latter. Should tliere be more than one such point, say two or more, having equal strengtll of connection, they may be treated together in one least-square adjustment. I n this manner point after point or a series of fiuch is adjusted in position, so t h a t t h e sun1 of t h e squares of t h e corrections to tlie observed horizontal directior~sshL11 be a minimum; the geometrical relations of tlie preueding poi~itebeing always considered as fixed with respect to the variable clementreof t h e new point or points next under treatment. The principal secondtiry stations having tl~us beconlo knomn in position, t h e tertiary positions are determined in t h e same systematic, , tl~ongh ~onlewliat less elaborate, manner a s that followed for t l ~ secondaries, e and generally without least square adjustment.

* We sllpposo here tho metres t o be prototype metres. t Eleven positions determil~odin 1894 were adtlod while this report passed through the press. t The positions wero plotted and eollnecting lines rlln in by hir. J . B. Boutello.

The final result of this systematic treatment lnay be sulnmarized by stating that 110 discrepancy remains in the results themselves! and that the length aud direction of any aide of a triangle may bo computod from any starting side, and through any series of connecting triangles, and get the same results will be reached. The latitudes and longitudes of t,he trigonometric points wero computed by the usual formulile, aided by the tables ordinarily employed in the Survey, for wllich see Appendix No. 7, Report for 1884, but preferably tlie preceding Appendix No. 9 of this report. For primary sides, not excecdil~g ill length (s) 100 or 150 liilometres (about G2 or 93 statute miles), the formula for difference of latitude (AF), difference of longitude (AA), and difference of azimuth (Aa), are very accurate or sufficiently perfect for the purpose; these are:*

- Ag, = s cos a . B + s2sill2 a . C + ( 8 ~D )-~ 1~s2 sin2 a . E Ah = s sin a sec 9' . A - Aa = Ah sin a(q + sec $(Aq) + (LIA)~.F where - gg, = s cos a B + s2sin2 a C nearly
PI)

and h = s c o s a B hence tlie results for the new position

For sides not exceeding 25 or 30 kilolnetrcs (about 15 or 19 statute miles) the fourth term nl the expression for Ag, may Ije omitted, also tho factor sec $ (Aq), as well as tlie second term in the exprousion for A a . For full oxplanation, forms, examples, and auxiliary tables the reader may consult tho latest appendix cited above. There also is showr~ the inverso problem, viz, given q and h and p1and h' (or F, pl, and Ah) to find s and a and a'. This process ]nay be used i n cases where the required distance and azimuths a r e not directly co~itained in the table of results. POI* the direct solution put: 1 ( 8 , cos n = x = - 3 -(LIP C y2 D (Ap)2 E (Ap)y2 E C y4)

For convenience of computi~igsecondary niid tertiary positions, the logarithlna of factors A, B, C, D, E are here reproduced for tlio limiting latitudes 400 65' to 420 55' so as to cover the parallels of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, and two applicatiolls are added, ono to exemplify the direct, the other the inverse, procese.

of which 447 belong to the Borden aurvey. Of the occupied statioris 103 are Borden stations, and 43 are common to both surveys. A number of computers mas ol~gagedupon this work, but the priucipal share of the. work fell to Mr. E. H. Courtenay of the Computing Division, to whose zeal, industry, and scrupulous care much of the accuracy of the results IS clue. The results uom communicated were deduced in 1884,1885, 188671889718007 1891,1892, and 1894.

Respecting the accuracy of a triangulatioli the mean error ?)t of an adjusted or resultiiig angle has been advantageously employed as a quantity of co1np:~risonfor ditf'erent triaiigulations by which to judgo of their relative valuo (see, e. g., Coast ancl Geodctic Survey lteport for 1884, p. 389). The valne s~may be deduced in various l~loro or less accurate mays, accordillg to circumstances; i11 acljusted triangulatioiis it may be readily deduced from

where B [ c is the sum of corrections, i r ~ e s p e c t i ~o ! f esig?zs, to observed directions, 18 the number of conditioiial equations invohed, and s the nuinber of directions in the adjusted figure. Iii unadjusted mork, i t may bo found from

or. mitliout squaring, from

where e = triangle closing error '(or difference from z + E ) , to be taken with positive sign in last formula, and t = number of triangles. Wo thus find for tho atljusted triangalation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, but exclusive of tlie priinary triangulation, for Massachusetts, tho value of ?)t = f 3Il.7, niid for its uuagjustetl mork eh = 3/'.9; siinilarly for tho Borden survey we find the averago values n 8 = 4 6".0 and 1 ) = ~ I G"'4 for adjusted aiid unadjusted work, respectively. The accuracy of the trinngulatioii may otherwise bo roughly expressed in terms of the distance, of and thus estimated the nveriige error of secoiidary work nlay rango between i6+G8 aiid i,-oloa-c the lei~gtli, while that of tertiary \~roi\lr iiiuy be ostilnated as low as T,l,-,-or , - less near its inferior limit. Therc reru:iiii but a few worcls to be added esplanatory of the table of results.
